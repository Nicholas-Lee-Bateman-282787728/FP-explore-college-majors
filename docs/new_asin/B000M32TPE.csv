8299302,2,B000M32TPE,Awesome movie! (last one directed by Warren Miller himself) but the picture & sound quality was not good. Whatever source tapes Amazon pulled from were degraded.,1458259200,,161,5.230769230769231
8299303,5,B000M32TPE,Another fun vintage Warren Miller film. Great narration as only Warren can do it. Glad it's available. Money well spent.,1438732800,,120,5.05
8299304,5,B000M32TPE,The last of the real Warren Miller films.  Sad that Warren's earlier films have not been released.  Probably because the new corporation's succeeding films are quite inferior to the retired master's films - and comparison of the old-to-the-new films would be embarrassing!,1418688000,,272,5.4523809523809526
