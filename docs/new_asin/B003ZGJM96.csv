4233715,4,B003ZGJM96,"This may be a B horror movie, but the script, acting, and directing are excellent. I laughed alot watching this movie. The jokes are great and and even the special effects are decent. It is one of the most entertaining B horrors I have seen in awhile. If you enjoy funny horror movies you will probably want to rent this one. After seeing it I want to add it to my collection.

When a fisherman in a small town is hit in the head with a golfball size meteor while fishing with his friend in a local stream, the weirdness and humor start up with a vengence. His brain is attacked by a tar creature and he becomes a Zombie. He sets out to see that anyone normal, serious, or seriously funny receives a lobotomy by hand. This is an R between the language, gore, and nudity so not for the kids.

4233716,4,B003ZGJM96,"This is a really fantastic little flick. First let me say that I am an aficionado of B-movie horrors. There are several necessities for these to appease fans of this genre, including interesting amusing characters, gore, and a good amount of nudity! Spectacular special effects or established stars are not requirements.
This movie succeeds on many levels. The story is simple, solid, and good! There are several funny characters with hilarious dialogues! The women are varying degrees of attractive and the nudity is there! The main actress who plays Sherry is absolutely gorgeous. Hope to see more of her in more movies. As an aside the recent 'night of demons' remake FAILS miserably because of the limited nudity; only one of the actresses gets her top off. Its amazing that old b-movies get remade now with the nudity gone. Those filmmakers simply don't get it.
Anyway this movie is great. Great likable characters. Very funny dialogue. Cheap, but gory and cool effects.",1291680000,2,975,5.0246913580246915
4233717,5,B003ZGJM96,"Kevin Tenney, director of the original Night of the Demons and Witchboard, is back with another fun movie. Brain Dead is in the tradition of the 80's horror movies like Night of the Creeps and Return of the Living Dead. It's a zombie movie that is fun from beginning to end.

Brain Dead might not be that scary, but it is very funny, gory, and crams more nudity into its first half  hour than most of todays horror films do in their entire running time. And the ensemble cast is great. There's not a bad actor in the bunch. Joshua Benton is especially good as our hero, spitting out funny one-liners just about every time he opens his mouth.

If you like Night of the Demons, The Evil Dead, or any of the aforementioned movies, you have got to check out Brain Dead. It's one of the most fun-filled horror movies of the year!",1290124800,13,824,4.337662337662338
4233718,2,B003ZGJM96,"Brain Dead (Kevin Tenney, 2007)

It took me a while to review this, and I ended up having to watch it again. Truly a memorable piece of filmmaking. Kind of amusing, but not all that hot. Simple plot, very basic in survival horror movies: a bunch of disparate folks get trapped in a building with zombies trying to get in, and have to not only fend off the zombies, but deal with each other as well, and in general, they don't like one another all that much. This is a scene that has been played out with almost infinite variety over the years, and the number of modern movies that do it right is more than ample evidence that, given the proper thought, it can be done in a new and interesting way. But this script, by Dale Gelineau (whose entire writing career before this movie consisted of an episode of Moonlighting), is not in any way new or interesting. It's funny at times, and some of the special effects are at least campy enough to be fun, but it's empty calories, and you'll probably forget it in a few days. **",1285113600,2,1021,4.317708333333333
4233719,4,B003ZGJM96,"I saw this at the International Horror and Sci-Fi Film Festival back in 2007. Can't believe it's just not getting a DVD release! Kevin Tenney is a great director who made such '80s classics as-Witchboard and Night of the Demons.
This movie was a fun gore-filled joy-ride. Although looking more low budget then his '80s fare, it still has the free spirit behind it.
Check out a great movie from someone who has experience in the horror genre not in music videos.",1282262400,10,461,4.634146341463414
4233720,1,B003ZGJM96,The title of the movie serves a dual purpose of describing the movie and the writers: brain dead. Don't waste your time.,1376092800,,120,4.5
4233721,1,B003ZGJM96,"I watched this movie and this was absolutely the worst film I have seen.  Nasty and disgusting without a script, plot or talent.  Offensive to women, in the worst way...Avoid at all cost.",1373760000,,187,4.636363636363637
4233722,1,B003ZGJM96,"How shall I begin a review of what was clearly one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my entire 53+ years on this planet?  I know, the truth!

Hear it is kids, if you want to spend approximately 1.5 hours doing something that will make you say ""Well, that's an hour and a half I'll never get back,"" then by all means, sit down with some people you don't like and watch Brain Dead.  Heck, you can even watch it  with people you like, it's just that if you watch it with people you don't like, you'll be rid of them rather quickly.  Hold it...if you're a somewhat sentient being, and you're around people you don't like, then they may end up liking this ""movie,"" and want to get to know you better, and come over all the time for '70's parties where everybody eats fondu.  Come to think of it, that may pose too great a danger...forget the whole ""people you don't like"" scenario.

Let's get to the movie proper.  This little gem starts promisingly enough with a guy getting his head ripped in half and his brain eaten in the first minute, but such wonderful gore becomes pretty scarce for a while after that.  Instead, the criminals responsible for this waste of good celluiloid asked themselves a dangerous question: ""How do we get every sixteen year old boy who even hears of this move watch it? I know, titties.""  They then degenerate into three different ""character introduction"" scenes in which several women remove their shirts or come out of the shower and show the drooling little pubescent monsters watching this thing the new definition of ""gratuitous boobs.""  Fun times.

Eventually, the show gets back on track when all of the characters find themselves in a cabin in the woods, with creatures lurking outside.  Several people get torn up, and the two righteous love birds who walk (limp) out of there when the sun comes up have more in store for them than you might think.

Allow me to apologize in advance for this last part.  I have to think that the movie's writers, director, and producers have done their best to keep their mothers from ever seeing this product of their depraved minds.  All I will say regarding this, is that when Amy gives up her secret, you're gonna wish you were somewhere else, with no video entertainment within five miles.

To sum up, I wish I hadn't seen this movie.  However, if I hadn't, I wouldn't be writing this review right now.  Weird how rewards are hidden in the most horrid events.",1370390400,2,2437,4.5228310502283104
4233723,3,B003ZGJM96,"It's easy to give a very low budget film like this one star. It's shot on video tape? or cheap film. THey did the best they could with the effects here and that's is actually a pretty well done job! However if you are not a fan of very low budget horror flicks then look elsewhere. I like them and the effects people complain about here would be top notch 30 years ago. And best of all there is no cgi! The best effects sometimes are made by people , as far as bloody zombies go! that is.  This are not zombies actually but parasites from outer space who control people's bodies. This is a throwback to films of the fifties; but there is nudity in this one. Including a crotch shot of a hot actress. Slime flies out of her in this movie , so this is not for kids in the least. The dialog is corny often and aimed at humor , and there's a lot of cussing throughout this flick. I enjoyed it though because I knew it was a very low budget flick with lots of nudity. So it's like a seventies sexploitation flick in that regard.  However my three stars is in regards to C movies and not for a or even b movies. However if you watch a c movie and expect any comparison to higher budget films forget about it. The actresses in this flick are all very hot and you do get some great shots of them partially or fully nude.  They are newbies and not pros but it doesn't matter in this regard. Surely if a b movie studio made this we could complain more but this is done by first timers out in la la land.",1369958400,,1493,4.037162162162162

4233733,2,B003ZGJM96,"Part of what makes Evil Dead so fantastic is that it was made to be scary -- that it fits into the B-movie mold so well was an accident. Brain Dead feels like it was made to imitate that style, but in trying to create that 80's feel it crammed puns in to every line delivered, stuck a naked breast in wherever they could go, went overboard on cheap gore/music effects, and forced the rubber-suited monster down the audiences throat. It tries so hard to be in the ""Cheesy 80's Horror"" category (no pun intended), it goes overboard. It almost looks like massive amounts of money were spent on what, in the 80's, was created with corn syrup and food coloring.

If you don't mind the 80's thing being forced into every crevice of a movie and love, love, love that style no matter what, this is for you. If you prefer the made-to-be-scary, accidentally funny, 80's Horror (They Live [free with Amazon Prime], C.H.U.D.

4233739,4,B003ZGJM96,"I pretty much swore off of most zombie films a while back as they've pretty much become the Star Trek of the horror genre anymore.  Hell, how exciting or fun can zombies be anymore when they're featured in television commercials and every video game that comes out has to include a ""zombie mode""?
But as a horror fan there is a certain loyalty to the legends of the genre, and the fact that Kevin Tenney directed this one piqued my interest.
The movie concerns an alien parasite that crashes to Earth and finds a human host, who then gets really ugly and runs about looking to eat human brains to reproduce.  A group of various cliched individuals take refuge in a cabin in the woods and have to fight off not only a psychotic escaped criminal, but the ravenous zombie-like creatures.
As you can see, not one shred of originality here, but it's about style.  The movie is enjoyable, tongue in cheek, bloody and booby.  One rather risque shot shows a closeup of a woman's...anatomy...as it spews forth a parasite!  That's probably the biggest stroke of originality on display.  Personally I'd rather watch a director like Tenney crank out a cheap rehash that be subjected to the Marcus Nispels of the world.
Yes, it's cheap, it has the shot on video look, the makeup is so-so, but it all works.  Worth a look....if you like this kind of stuff.",1315785600,10,1342,4.589958158995816

8410286,4,B003ZGJM96,"I have to admit that I'm growing kind of tired of the glut of DTV zombie comedy films that have been popping up lately, but when I learned that director Kevin S. Tenney (WITCHBOARD - 1986; NIGHT OF THE DEMONS - 1988; PEACEMAKER - 1990) was responsible for this, I just had to give it a view and I'm glad to report that it's pretty good. A small meteor embeds itself into the head of a fly fisherman in some backwoods burg, instantly turning him into a brain-hungry zombie (the first thing he does is stick his thumbs through his buddy's eyes and tear his head in two, a nifty effect that is about as gory as anything you have ever seen). We are then introduced to the usual bunch of oddball characters, including wisecracking Clarence Singer (Joshua Benton), a local man arrested for a traffic offence, who is handcuffed to violent criminal Bob Jules (David Crane), just as Bob blows off a deputy's head with a shotgun (another uber-gory effect) and escapes from custody; the lecherous Reverend Farnsworth (Andy Forrest) and his horny female secretary Amy (Cristina Tiberia); and lost hikers Claudia Bush (Michelle Tomlinson), a lesbian, and big-busted Sherry Morgan (Sarah Grant Brendeke), as they all converge on an abandoned fishing lodge deep in the woods. As you can probably guess, they all soon come under attack by a couple of alien zombies, who spread their infection not by the normal bite, but by expelling a black slimy liquid out of their mouths and onto the heads of their victims. The dumb-as-a-post and ultra-violent Bob holds everyone hostage, even after witnessing one of the zombies putting his fist through the head of nosy female park ranger Sydney (Tess McVicker), which just adds to the difficulty level of survival for everyone involved. It's not long before our unlucky six fish-out-of-water begin getting gorily killed or infected, beginning with Amy and Bob. It turns out that the big-busted Sherry is not a bimbo at all, but rather a brainiac, as she correctly deduces that the black ooze is an alien organism that attaches itself to the brain, slowly eating it's host's brain until it craves more cerebral tissue. When Clarence and Sherry make an important discovery in the lodge's basement, it becomes apparent that the alien organism is very intelligent. Maybe too intelligent for our meager human brains to understand.  Though a little too flippant for it's own good (Dale Gelineau's screenplay offers so many witty remarks from Clarence [he acts like a less-educated Dennis Miller], you'll want to punch him in the face to shut him up), BRAIN DEAD delivers so much gore and nudity (there's so much full frontal female nudity in the first twenty minutes, you'll think you died and gone to Nudist Heaven!), you'll forgive some of the cringe-worthy dialogue (although I did have a good laugh at Bob's recollection of having a near-death experience on the electric chair and, ever since that day, he can't keep his hair flat!). Director Kevin S. Tenney makes the most out of special makeup effects master Gabe Bartalos' gory makeup effects, never pulling away from the money shots and really delivering the bloody goods, offering decapitations (too many to keep track of) and other head violence, arms hacked or blown off and one zombie being cut in two with a shotgun. The majority of the effects are refreshingly the practical kind, although CGI is employed on a few scenes (including a long shot of the after-effects of Sydney's head-punching). There are a few standout funny sequences, such as Amy being infected by the alien, but since she's such an airhead, the organism bypasses her brain and hides in her uterus instead (!), so when she comes back to the lodge seemingly unharmed, the black ooze shoots out of her vagina and attaches itself to lesbian Claudia's face (a fitting choice). After tossing Claudia face-first into a roaring fireplace, Clarence turns to Sherry and asks, ""What kind of amoeba is that?"" to which Sherry replies, ""A Trojan amoeba? How the Christ do I know?"" Tenney also gives the film a funny framing device and offers an unapologetically downbeat, yet sarcastically fitting, finale. You can do a lot worse than this low-budget horror comedy and, God knows, I certainly have. Also starring Locky Lambert, Chad Martin Guerrero, Greg Lewolt and low-budget auteur Jim Wynorski (CHOPPING MALL - 1986; SORCERESS - 1994) as Sheriff Bodine, who has a severe hard-on for Clarence and his family.
