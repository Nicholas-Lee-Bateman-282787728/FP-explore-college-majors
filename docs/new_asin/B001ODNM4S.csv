They are campy and cheesy, with talking cars,ghosts, death at every turn, but they do carry an important message. One short has the ghost of a father visiting the surviving family members of an auto crash that was really caused by this clueless lady and her gabby friend riding shotgun, yet somehow he feels to blame. Another short has that young boy from the Partridge Family dreaming that the family car is talking to him. Pure nightmare fuel! They make for a haunting night of viewing.",1242432000,,572,4.673267326732673
8330539,5,B001ODNM4S,"This is a fun collection. Although scary, the films they used to show us in driver's ed showing real bodies in deadly accidents has been happily omitted. Still, it's weird enough to supply plenty of nightmare fuel. Ghosts from accidents come back from the dead, cars talk to young boys, toy cars are run over by toy locomotives, cute, campy, fun. Still there are good lessons here which should be learned by all, Don't drink and drive, watch out for the other fellow, be Careful! Educational and entertaining.",1230163200,,509,4.795454545454546
