5090564,5,B007J3ISIM,"Ahh the good old days. I'm a big Zelda fan, and I love the cartoon as cheesey as it is. I've been waiting for an addition that is affordable, so finally I got the complete season for just 7.99 at best buy. The legend of zelda cartoon was combined with the Super mario brothers super show. This is best upon the first Zelda game, though it may include references to Zelda II.

STORY

The Legend of Zelda is an American animated series based on the The Legend of Zelda video game series for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The plot follows the adventures of Link and Princess Zelda as they defend the kingdom of Hyrule from an evil wizard named Ganon. It is heavily based on the first game of the Zelda series, The Legend of Zelda, but includes some references to the second, Zelda II: The Adventure of Link.

Characters

The characters are different than you expect from playing the first game, I will explain to each character.

Link closely emulates his video game appearance, wearing a long green hat with a lighter green stripe around the brow, a green tunic, and a brown belt. He wears a light leathery red long shirt underneath the tunic, pants, and a pair of tall dark brown boots. He has brown hair as in the first two games in the series. He carries a magic sword which is capable of firing bolts of pink colored energy to destroy his enemies. He is an adept swordsman and a quick thinker, but is somewhat childish. He often tries to get out of his responsibilities and winds up in more trouble than he predicts. Despite his character flaws he has a very noble heart and will go out of his way to protect anyone, especially Zelda.
 Zelda has a more detailed depiction than in the video games. She is about as tall as Link, with shoulder-length blond hair. She wears a pair of garnet-colored orb earrings and a blue linked tiara on her head. Her clothing consists of a blue vest and a purple overshirt, somewhat outside the ""traditional"" role of a princess. She wears a pair of lavender pants and a pair of reddish tan thigh-high boots. Her personality is somewhere between stuck-up and compassionate; she would die to protect her kingdom from harm. At one with the Triforce of Wisdom, she is well-versed in its magics and can wield its power. She is also quite skilled with the bow and the boomerang. She secretly loves Link, though she does not tell him because she does not want it to go to his head.
 Spryte is modeled after the generic fairies in the Legend of Zelda video game. She wears a short tunic and her short, cropped hair is a sandy blond (though occasional glitches switch it to a darker brown). She is smart-mouthed, quick, and full of magical energy. Her father is king of the fairies, and she works as an assistant or servant to Zelda. She too has a crush on Link and is more obvious about it, constantly flirting with Link who usually brushes it off due to his attraction to Zelda.
 King Harkinian is Zelda's father, King of all Hyrule. Although he is never seen in the game, he is present in the series. He is a tall, somewhat rotund king with a snow white beard and a gold crown. Although somewhat dimwitted as a father, he has a knack for ingenuity, is loyal to his country, and possesses a profound insight into those around him. He is a wise ruler, though forgetful and fearful of Ganon. He has no affinity with magic but has superior diplomatic abilities.
 The Triforce of Wisdom, a sage-like glowing green triangular talisman, is more of a magical object than a member of the cast. Its feminine voice offered sage advice, in rhyming riddles.
 The Triforce of Power has a dominating male voice, is more casual in its speech than the Triforce of Wisdom, and in its only speaking role, it chose to admonish Ganon for pretending to be an amateur at the practice of magic.
 Ganon is a large anthropomorphic pig who is the main antagonist of the series. He uses an endless supply of magic to aid him in his attempts to overthrow the kingdom of Hyrule. Obtaining the powers of instant teleportation, he also owns the ""Evil Jar,"" with which he can summon and create his deadliest minions. Ganon is short-tempered, and his plans are often flawed by the ineptitude of his servants. He has a high, shrill voice and wears a set of purple robes over his body; his hood can also act as a disguise for when he must go ""incognito"". His powers are limited outside of his underground dungeon domain, hence why he likes to spend more time loitering here. While on the surface, he must rely fully on his servants to perform tasks for him.

ANIMATION

The animation is really good, no mistakes on that

Voice acting

The voice acting is great, spryte is so cute! I really liked the voice of Ganon. Link has a real cocky/obnoxious yet funny voice. Zelda sounds like your typical blonde girl, but tough and brave at the same time.

DVD QUALITY

The quality of the picture is rather sharp, however, the audio is a little low.

TRAILERS

Includes several trailers to various cartoons distrubuted by the DVD manufacturers.

FINAL WORD

This is a must have to your zeld collection. A great show formatted onto a great DVD at an affordable price. Includes all 13 episodes. The previous edition may have more special features, so if you're look for tons of special features. the get the more expensive edition, but if you want the show just to have it, and could care less about special features, then this is the way to go!",1362182400,28,5431,4.521428571428571
5090565,5,B007J3ISIM,"As a hardcore The Legend of Zelda fan, I couldn't wait to buy and watch the old TV show. It really shows its age at parts and for the most part the show is kind of cheesy, but in a way that I find really enjoyable and definitely worth watching.",1360195200,4,244,3.9
5090566,4,B007J3ISIM,"(Link says that about a million times) I have to say, this is definitely not how I pictured these characters. Link is quite obnoxious. But my son loves the Zelda games and he is thrilled with this DVD, so I'm satisfied.",1344384000,4,219,4.365853658536586
5090567,2,B007J3ISIM,What's with these new companies now a days? NCircle is known for putting out releases of shows that Shout Factory put out a few years ago... The thing is? Poor quality! You don't jam 13 episodes on to 1 dvd! It lessens the quality of the picture! Not to mention NO BONUS FEATURES! The Shout Factory release was awesome compared to this... If you can't release good quality shows like how Shout Factory did it then don't do it at all! Seriously it's stupid... I rather pay the $20-$30.00 for the good set rather then paying the $6.00 for a crappy set.. And this isn't the first time... NCircle had released a few dvds for Sonic The Hedgehog but not complete and the episodes are random on the dvds... Just a example people... Take my advice and get the original dvds from Shout Factory...,1344297600,20,787,4.472222222222222
5090568,5,B007J3ISIM,The Legend of Zelda cartoon came out when the Zelda games didn't have a big complex story like they do now. But this cartoon does remain quite faithful to the first 2 nes Zelda games. (Links hair was brown in them btw)The action scenes are good and it's awesome how they made Link into such a pervert and Zelda into such a whiny spoiled brat. For only 10 bucks you have no excuse not to buy this DVD.,1339027200,19,400,4.141025641025641

5090625,5,B007J3ISIM,"According to the kids, dyed in the wool fans, this was the bomb.  They loved watching and remembering and reading up on the progression of Link.  There was no trouble with the video or audio and it was very true to the productions of that day.",1501027200,2,243,4.260869565217392
5090626,4,B007J3ISIM,"This is a great set to enjoy the 80s Zelda cartoon on. Now it's not really a ""set"" as its just one disc, but the entire show is on one disc as it only ran for one season. In order to achieve this the video bitrate jumps around 4-7mb/s, which isn't bad for such limited source material, but there are a few areas where the transfer doesn't quite hold up. Overall though the picture quality is good. The audio leaves a bit to be desired. It's a 2.0 AC3 track at 256kb/s, which again isn't bad, I'm not expecting a 5.1 mix nor would I care for one, but I higher audio bitrate would've been nice. There also seems to be a few errors in the audio master as a few of the later episodes presented a very high pitch (may not be audible to all) ringing throughout the entirety of some episodes. As far as bonus material goes there's only a few trailers for some other DVD collections from this company, no real bonus content as the disc is already packed to the brim with the whole series, but again any type of BTS or interview with the creators or actors would've been a nice get. All that being said, this DVD is still more than good for the price I got it for (about $7).

As for the show itself, the creators had to make up a lot about the world for themselves as there wasn't a whole lot of lore to go off of from the source material at the time, so Link is a bit of a snarky perv (nothing I'd say inappropriate for kids), always trying to get a kiss from Zelda, but I quite enjoyed his personality in this imagining. Zelda is probably what even modern fans might want from a new show or movie interpretation of the Princess. She's often in distress, but she's no helpless damsel. She can hold her own just about as well as Link can. The animation is what you might expect from a budget 80's toon. A few moments are jarring & cheap but overall nothing about the animation is offensive. The animators knew where to cheap out and where to spend the effort & budget. None of it took away from my enjoyment of the series.

Even if this incarnation of Hyrule isn't your cup of tea I'd still recommend this to any Zelda fan since the price is so good. It's an entertaining and funny cartoon you can just throw on in the background and enjoy.",1500940800,2,2232,4.188372093023256

I ripped the video, ran through final cut, deinterlaced the video file and doubled the frame rate.

It definitely brings back a lot of nostalgia from when I was young. I remember waking up so early just to watch the Nintendo line up, but omg, it's bad. So bad that I love it so much. XD The cheesy dialogue, the terrible voice acting. It's everything as I remember and just way too good to pass up, especially if you already own The Super Mario Super Show boxset.

I highly recommend adding this to your collection!! You know who you are!!

But if you happen to be young or started your Legend of Zelda craze on the Nintendo 64... I would suggest that you watch a few clips on Youtube or something, cause it's definitely not the Link & Zelda that you know and love. Just remember, this series was heavily influenced with the same laid back, fun times, 4th party breaking genre that the originally Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoon would do.",1487116800,4,958,4.462857142857143

But eventually this series got an initial release on DVD which was also disappointing (only 5 episodes)  BUT NOW here we have the complete season in 1 single disc. The quality of the transfer is not at all remastered, but it's decent enough where it won't bother you and it's fun to relive these episodes... I actually showed it to my 9 year old son (and one of my nephews) and they both really enjoyed it. The characters are familiar to them, the stories are simple and all the sound effects are taken from the old NES game. It's light hearted and filled with comedy, plus that ""excuuuuse me Princess"" is still annoyingly funny (and would probably make a terrible drinking game for us adults) long story short, this is fun for the whole family.",1474761600,,1006,4.558011049723757

You can hear it on the menu screen but not for the episode which slightly let me down.

This is the same as the other release that's by SHOUT Factory! The video quality is decent, considering its 3 hours,9 minutes,and 14 seconds (exactly) from beginning to end on one disc. That includes the opening credits, closing,and the 13 episodes which are roughly 15 minutes long (each episode). There are no special features at all,and the case is a white standard DVD case.

Imagine watching The Simpsons without that opening song and animation before each episode.

5090705,3,B007J3ISIM,"This DVD has all 13 episodes of the Legend of Zelda show.
Note: If you see the ""Havoc in Hyrule"" or ""Ganon's Evil Tower"" DVDs suggested, know that they contain subsets of episodes of this collection. There were only 13 episodes made, I can I see why...

Pros:
- Super cheap price. If you have a hankering to see one of your favorite video games series in show form, don't hesitate to shell out five bucks. Just expect to get your money's worth.
- Neat references to The Legend of Zelda and The Legend of Zelda II in terms of sounds, monsters, how battles go down, etc.

Cons:
- Terrible plots. The bad guys are idiots, the good guys are idiots. Good guys handily win in every 15-min episode.
- Sub-par animation. Mouth moving while not talking, coloring mistakes, etc.
- Cheesy dialog. Link says his catchphrase 29 times in the 13 episodes. Sometimes it's just egregious.
- The audio for the main menu is from the show's intro. And the audio restarts every time you navigate in the menu. You have to select ""Play All"" to actually see the intro.

Comparison with other versions:
Some of the other reviews are complaining that this version doesn't include the intro at all, which is incorrect. If you select ""Play All,"" the intro will play, followed by the episodes. The intro doesn't play before each episode.

Bonus features:
There is a ""Trailers"" option on the main menu, which plays a trailer for the Super Mario Bros show, followed by a trailer for Sonic Underground.",1456012800,35,1470,4.599236641221374

5090755,4,B007J3ISIM,"I was so happy when I saw this on amazon. I LOVED THIS CARTOON when I was younger and I still love it. I looked at the reviews for both this company's version (NCircle Entertainment) and reviews for the Shout Factory version (which was released first). As always there are mixed reviews, both have high ratings but the Shout Factory's has more reviews. Difference is price and shout factory version is in 3 discs instead of one and they have special features. I went with this one (NCircle) because it was $5 instead of $25 - (Shout factory) and I love it other than the episodes do not have the Intro to them at all (as far as Shout factory I have no idea if they included it but if I knew I would have gone with that one) and for that I was a bit upset because it is still part of the show and I happen to love the intro, so I don't understand why they left it out  and that's why I'm docking it one star, other than that it's fantastic. So to sum up my point here if you want the whole season on 1 disc and maybe not so great of picture (remember this was made in the 80's) and don't care that the intro is not included than this is the one for you but if you want extra features and a better picture (since it's on 3 discs and not crammed on 1) then I suggest getting shout factory's version. Hopefully this will help future buyers. ok this section following is an update. the disc does indeed have the intro but only if you choose the option to play all and it only does it one time before the first episode and none of the others, but having watched the super mario bros super show each episode shows scenes for that particular episode of zelda which would make sense why they didn't do the intro for each episode on this disc.

There's even an official (still ridiculous) timeline to connect (link) all the times that Link has found three magic rocks and a master sword. But is that what the series needs?

This show is a time-warp to a time when Zelda was New! And everything in the franchise was open for interpretation. If there were a zelda show these days, Link would be all scowly and have absolutely no personality.

This show is hilarious in ways that cartoons are not allowed to be any more. The innuendos and subtext blow the ""adult"" cartoons of today out of the water.
Link is a loveable goofy misogynist and Zelda bosses him around. Link and Zelda bicker in a way which is extremely familiar (and funny) to anyone who's been in a long term relationship.
Everything else, from the gags to the animation is standard for 80's cartoon shows. The world is treated like a videogame world with videogame logic, so the cartooniness fits well.

Some might complain about the quality of the DVD. But this is an 80s cartoon. No matter how Hi-Fi the copy is, it will still look like a grainy, cheaply animated 80s cartoon show. So who cares?",1414368000,25,1214,4.611111111111111
5090761,1,B007J3ISIM,"I Love the Legend of Zelda...I despise this cartoon.  I played the LOZ on the NES when I was a kid, on the N64 when I was older, and with my own children on the Wii and the Wii U.  My family and I are fans of the franchise.
We were excited to buy and view the cartoons.  What a disappointment! The dialogue, the voices, and the themes in this cartoon series are not representative of the video game series.  That said, I am not a purist; I would be fine with artistic license and deviation from the content found in the video games. This cartoon series is annoying. There is nothing redeeming about the content of this cartoon series...it is not funny, interesting, imaginative or exciting.  Link's voice is so annoying, it is impossible to be in the same room with this show on. The character's voices and the dialogue are base and irritating. The themes are repetitive and simple-minded.  What a waste of what could have been an awesome addition to the LOZ series!",1413331200,4,966,4.4602272727272725

5090764,5,B007J3ISIM,"For anyone who was an 80's kid this is a great throw back to those days.
Cheesy drama, villians talking to themselves and heroes who always win; these are things we remember and love.
Aside from the repeat line of ""excuse me princess ......"" this is a great collection for any Zelda fan.  Especially those that remember Link with brown hair.
With references to both Zelda 1 and Zelda 2, I loved it and so did my kids as well.",1409702400,,425,4.3125
5090765,5,B007J3ISIM,"This is not for you if you're not a long time fan of the LoZ series. The reason why? This is totally non-canonical. If you're expecting to see Link as you know him in A Link to the Past and onward, you're not finding him here. The Link in this series is somewhat dumb, can be relatively annoying, and does not have blonde hair, which apparently a lot of people get somewhat up in arms about. What needs to be understood is that when this show was made the future of the franchise was largely unclear and there was no set model for Link at the time. So, keep that in mind, give this a shake, it's really not that bad. Or, rather, it's so bad that it's great. Let's just say we can probably all be glad they chose to keep Link a silent protagonist in the game.",1407110400,,758,4.093959731543624

Being born after the series aired in the US .She was pleased with the plot if not always happy over the off the shelf ,and very  late 1980's animation style .

5090778,1,B007J3ISIM,"I love Zelda the video games, I can't think of anything in the world video game wise that I love more. I was so juiced when I got this DVD because I though it was going to capture the bliss of the video and the beauty that is link and his quest. It didn't. I was so angry I sent it back three episode in.

The first thing that upset was Link's voice, seriously he sounds like his nose is got a laundry clip on it. The second was his hair color, brown...brown! He is a blonde, a beautiful, perfect blonde!

The 3rd and the most important to me I found about 30 seconds into the episode. He is a jerk. The Link I know gives up everything to save Hyrule without getting anything in return, he is a hero because he cares about the people and not because he gets something out of it. I just wanted to pop his head off.

It may sound like I'm a crazy fan, but I'm just stating my opinions, I would suggest this series to anyone unless I wanted them to mock it with me or see the horror and feel my pain. It is worth a watch if you like TV shows and movies because everything is worth at least one watch, you don't know what you like unless you try it.",1372636800,6,1145,3.948051948051948

Understandably, I could understand why the series was short lived because of how cheesy this animation can get with its acting and storyline. For what it is, this was developed and aired with the Live Action Cartoon Series known as the Mario Bros that really tried to capture the imagination for the 80's and 90's generation that were lucky enough to watch this every saturday morning. There was only one season and is just a chunk of animation history brimmed with all things Nintendo.",1524960000,,600,4.616822429906542
