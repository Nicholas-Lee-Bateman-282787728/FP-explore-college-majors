THE MALE LEAD IN THE MOVIE WORKED ON WALL STREET AND LIKED TO WATCH THE OLYMPIC RUNNERS AND HE WAS INSPIRED BY A MAN WHO STARTED TRAINING AND RUNNING LATE IN LIFE AND WON A TROPHY.  SO HE BEGINS TO TRAIN AND LIES TO HIS WIFE (LINDSAY WAGNER) ABOUT HIS WHEREABOUTS WHILE HE SECRETLY TRAINS AT A TRAINING CAMP.  SHE FINDS OUT, LEAVES HIM HE COMPETES IN A RACE AND WINS AND SHE TAKES HIM BACK.  I ONLY GOT THIS MOVIE BECAUSE I'M A FAN OF LINDSAY WAGNER BUT SHE IS NOT THE STAR OF THIS MOVIE, IT'S ALL ABOUT HER HUSBAND AND YOU DON'T SEE HER THAT MUCH.  I FAST-FORWARDED THROUGH MOST OF THE MOVIE, I COULDN'T WAIT UNTIL IT WAS OVER.",1313452800,2,658,4.109375

For me having seen the original & for some years knew of this version but unable to see it until now, I had some hopes for a really good movie. Based on the former movie & actor Daniel Auteuil, as in my opinion is currently the most talented male actor in French cinema!
Just see ""Mr. 73"" or retiled ""The Last Deadly Mission"" to see a truly terrific performance of a down & out cop on his last legs! And same director I might add!
 Or ""On Guard"" or Jean De Florette / Manon of the Spring, Le Huitime jour and  Un Coeur en Hiver just to name a few! Nor does he disappoint here, but the movie does!

Unfortunately the movie lacks a heart beat, or rather it has low blood pressure. And becomes a monotone & flat mostly thru-out with the exception of the few action scenes that are really terrific!

It has Melville's story & most scenes & dialogue reproduced, but it lacks energy to lift it off the screen & get the viewer involved!
Daniel Auteuil has the age to play this & in fact is older than Lino Ventura was in the original and his age adds to his world weary escaped prisoner persona! He looks like he needs a Second Wind, but can't find it anywhere!

If I where a teacher I'd grade this as ""C"". And the original as A-minus! You most likely won't find this for rental anywhere as the region 2 precludes that usually.  So if you must see it go for it,  but don't expect to be blown over by a fast paced action picture!
Bon chance!

Also, the copy I received from Amazon itself, via a vendor selling Amazon Fulfilled products was a region 1. I was expecting a region 2 & have a region free player, but received a R.1. And the art work on the DVD cover is different from the product page; see my added photos. So you may want to contact a vendor or two to check and see just what version they carry. Perhaps you can purchase a R.1 for your player!",1306022400,3,1940,4.138297872340425
8084420,4,B000BB0ACQ,"French director Alain Corneau has spent so much of his recent career making mood and character pieces that don't really go anywhere that it's all too easy to forget he started out making thrillers. From the poor critical and box-office reaction to his 2007 version of Le Deuxieme Souffl, or The Second Wind as it's called on UK DVD, he might have regretted going back to his old stamping ground for what would be his penultimate film, especially after the unflattering comparisons with Jean-Pierre Melville's 1966 version of Jose Giovanni's novel, but it's a surprisingly effective thriller on its own terms. While it's relatively unusual to see him handling a story with a distinct beginning, middle and end these days, he responds surprisingly well to the pulp material and even improves on some aspects of Melville's version. Whereas Melville's film, not one of his best by any stretch of the imagination, was a few set pieces the director was interested in and a lot of exposition he wasn't, Corneau's version (co-written by Giovanni) feels like a more complete narrative that has its director's complete attention throughout and one that doesn't outstay its welcome at two-and-a-half hours.

The film's biggest hurdle is its usually reliable leading man. A miscast Daniel Auteuil convincingly conveys the out of shape and past it aspect of his escaped con looking for a big score to fund his getaway only to find himself set up as an informer and desperate to clear his name but, despite looking surprisingly like a shrunken Lino Ventura in a couple of sequences, lacks the iconic presence the part really needs and never really comes into his own until the last third. We learn more about the character from the way other characters describe him than we ever get out of his performance, resulting in a nominal leading man who never really lives up to his constant buildup (""In this rotten world, he has the guts to accept what he does - the supreme elegance of a lost man. Gu signs his crimes,"" ""He has the luxury of having nothing to lose while we just dabble in felony""). While the discrepancy between what he was, what he is now, how others see him and how he sees himself is intentional, Auteuil still comes up short because you simply can't imagine him ever being the stuff of underworld legend.

Far more convincing is Eric Cantona, a credibly thuggish presence as a loyal partner in crime - he doesn't need to be a great actor because his look and his bearing does all the work for him. But then this is a film where the supporting characters are often more interesting than the anti-hero. Despite a disappointing opening scene that pales beside Paul Meurisse's showstopping entrance in Melville's film, Michel Blanc soon makes the part of the world-weary flic on Auteuil's trail his own, while Jacques Dutronc brings more depth to the stylish but noncommittal intermediary Orloff than is probably on the page. Daniel Duval's wonderfully named thief Venture Ricci and Philippe Nahon's brutal cop have less to work with but still manage to make an impression, though the best that can be said for Monica Bellucci's moll is that while she may not be particularly good she's not particularly bad enough to be a problem.

It doesn't reach the epic heights you sense it might be aspiring to but the professional violence and the setpieces are well handled, with the big heist (now taking place in a warehouse district rather than a country road) particularly effective. We also get to see the infamous water torture sequence that caused so many censorship problems in the previous adaptation this time, though the hiding the guns sequence that made such an impression on John Woo is missing this time round. It's more stylised than Melville's film, with dreamlike slow motion in some scenes and an unreal color scheme of simultaneously saturated but slightly sickly reds, greens and amber throughout looking more like a Jeunot and Caro film or the kind of unreal color of a 60s comic book than the classic noir or neo-noir look. The film only changes to natural color in the film's closing shot as the public - a few indistinct innocent bystanders notwithstanding. otherwise unseen for the entire movie - return to reclaim the scene of the crime, oblivious to the violence that took place there as they go about their everyday lives as if in a parallel world. And while, at the end of the day the film may not have much more to say than that criminals live in a different and more exaggerated world to the rest of us, if you take it as simply a decent thriller that's probably enough.

Optimum's UK PAL DVD has a good 2.35:1 widescreen transfer with English subtitles. the only extra is the trailer.",1284076800,2,4707,4.793103448275862
