5697114,5,B00C888NRO,"By now, most people are aware that Diana grew up at Althorp and spent most of her childhood there.  I enjoyed seeing Charles showing us around his home.",1382313600,,152,4.428571428571429
5697115,4,B00C888NRO,"This was a better mix of history and house tour than the one on Chatsworth. Charles Spenser is the tour guide and he DOES point out and explain art and furniture and other items in the house. The history is not just Diana which is very good, although perhaps too much on the George Washington link. I still would have preferred more house tour and less history but overall not a bad show.",1375401600,11,388,4.328767123287672
5697116,5,B00C888NRO,"We all know that Lady Diana grew up at Althrop. But very few know the ins and outs of it's history. I had no idea that George Washington had a connection to the Spencers. I didn't know that Althorp opens up to the public couple months out of the year. I find it very interesting to see the hall where Diana used to tap dance, and where she used to play as a little girl. I love shows like this where the actual people who live there are still there working to keep things going. I have a new found respect for the Earl Spencer. Fantastic program!",1374883200,11,546,4.11214953271028
5697117,5,B00C888NRO,"Not only did we enjoy this, we learned a lot, and ended with the greatest respect for the Earl Spencer.  He and his advisers have done an amazing job with something so vital to World History.  I did not know about their relationship to the Washingtons, and in turn the destiny of the United States. What he has done to honor and preserve Princess Diana and her legacy is amazing and so tastefully done. Very innovative financially to preserve Althorp Estate for many generations to come.  The interior is so beautiful...we did not expect such a wonderful show.  Thank you all.",1373500800,17,576,4.673267326732673
5697118,5,B00C888NRO,"This is a documentary about Althorp.  Most of us know it as the childhood home of Lady Diana and her brother Charles, what most of us don't know is the 500 year history with 19 generations that lived there. I was fascinated to find out that the Spencers had a close relationship with the Washington family (George Washtington) and they too have a place nearby. I also loved Charles in this, he explained he was simply the keeper of this estate for future generations. He came across as almost humble and to see the rooms, hear the history and the family stories was fantastic. I would recommend this highly.. MY only complaint is it appears PBS is doing this as a series (Secrets of Hampton Court WONDERFUL), Secrets of .... (you get the idea) so far I have seen four in this series but I wish they would give it a common name so I can catch it on the DVR when they are on.

I also love how they compare how things are done today with how they were done centuries ago. Photos complete these stories as well. There was also times when it looked like the estate wouldn't survive, especially during the war where it was in such bad shape even the historical society wouldn't take it when they tried to give it away because the upkeep became to much. But they managed to keep it and the stunning artifacts intact and now improved.  Althorp is open to the public two months out of the year and that money goes to charity as well.

Interviews with Charles, and some of the caretakers and the gamekeeper on the estate are wonderful additions.

I would add this to your library. There is some mention of Diana of course, but there is such a rich history in this family it is really informative and so well done.",1373241600,17,1703,4.3765822784810124
5697149,5,B00C888NRO,I've always been fascinated with architecture of larger homes and castles. This is a wonderful display of wealth. This is the home that Princess Diana grew up in. I found it nice to know that it is still in the Spencer family.,1428364800,,226,4.404761904761905

5697169,5,B00C888NRO,"Another of the Secrets of the manor houses, loved it, This is where Princess Diana was born as was Duchess Georgiana 200 years before which is told in the DDVD ""The Duchess "" . The Spencers and the Churchills were once one family until 4 brothers had an altercation some 400 odd years ago. They split up 2 Spencers and 2 Churchills and both had then separate ancestory homes. As we know PM Churchill was born in a Palace the name escapes me now but it is the only great house well known and still privately owned I have not found. The Spencer House Althorp is also privately owned and the Son has been the Earl ever since his fathers death decades ago now as are many others too..",1406246400,3,680,4.27906976744186

5697172,3,B00C888NRO,"This DVD is just okay, in my opinion.  Too much time is taken to talk about Diana, with nothing new added to her well-known story.  There is also quite a bit of time devoted to the Washington family, I suppose in an effort to appeal to American audiences.  I really wanted to see more of a house tour.  The part about Althorp being a working farm was interesting, and the contributions by the maid and estate workers was very good.  However, if you really want to learn more about Althorp a better choice would be to read Earl Spencer's book Althorp: The Story of a House.  Of course, the books doesn't have the advantage of audio and video, but it really is much more informative, with many pictures and stories about the family and the house.",1395187200,3,744,4.4338235294117645

5697174,5,B00C888NRO,"I watched part of this on PBS and wasn't able to finish it so I purchased it on Amazon.  As with everything else, it arrived quickly.  It's a very, very well done inside look at Princess Diana's ancestral home but, more than that, it's a look at a dying class and a peek into the landed gentry that is also quickly going away.  Charles Spencer does a great job of sharing his family home's history while also keeping his tongue in his cheek regarding the ""gentry"" part of the past.",1391299200,4,481,4.322222222222222
5697175,5,B00C888NRO,"If you are interested in English history, or the English aristocracy, then this is for you, particularly if you are an American. The Spencers produced some notable and revolutionary human rights advocates such as the late Diana, Princess of Wales. But did you know that they also played host to George Washington 's (yes, the American president!) ancestors before they left England to seek their fortune in the New World, as America was called back then? Or some of the Spencers' more eccentric ancestors? This also reflects the strong sense of duty that the Spencer family members express which manifests itself throughout this fascinating DVD presentation. A respectful, tasteful documentary and a must see for history lovers everywhere. A good commentary for students of social history.",1390867200,,789,5.26984126984127
5697176,5,B00C888NRO,"PBS did an outstanding documentary on my family (my father shares the exact first middle and last name of the current Earl of Spencer and brother to the devastatingly beautiful and elegant Princess Diana).

For me this is such a gem. Though I have visited England, I have not had the opportunity to visit the family estate of Althorp.  This documentary gives you a great look into the history of the estate and my family.

Charles Spencer (the current Earl) has done a brilliant job of renovating the estate, and preserving the amazing collection of art pieces.

For those who don't know. The Spencers are one of the lucky aristocratic families of England still able to own their family estate which has been in our family for over 500 years. The current family headed by Charles has done a beautiful job of keeping Princess Diana's memory alive with a beautiful pond and shrine to her memory and digital media presentation of her life and important legacy.  It is wonderful of Charles to allow himself to be interviewed and he does such a loving and elegant presentation of the family.  A must see for Downton Abbey viewers, Anglophiles, and those interested in English aristocracy.

Again I'm so proud to be Spencer..  James Ross Spencer II and to see our family crest, coat of arms on Althrop.

I wish however that the Earl would have talked a little about the farming of the lands.  There is actually a Spencer Pea (a vegetable) created by my family and the color Spencer green (which runs through parts of the estate. a soft pale green) was not discussed.

I loved the info on the Washingtons..  and the link to America!

Many of the earliest Spencers in the US came in through Boston and were guests of the Washingtons.. My heritage came in after and settled in the Bahamas owning plantations before moving into Key West and parts of the South.

The current Earl and I share a great great ? Uncle John Cornelius Spencer who was knighted by Queen Victoria for his culinary skills. The current chefs at Althrop have made specific dishes served through parts of England. It would have been nice if that was mentioned.

However The Secrets of Althrop: Spencers is a must see. !

8578650,5,B00C888NRO,"This grand house was built in 1508 by a Spencer, and the family has owned it for an astounding 19 generations. The title of Earl was bestowed in 1765 and the current owner is Charles the 9th Earl Spencer. The Spencer name is probably most known world-wide because of Charles' sister, Diana. She now ""rests on a peaceful island in the middle of the Oval lake. The spot is marked by a simple monument.""

A stroke of genius. Althorp is open to the public for two months of the year, and not only is Diana's resting place serene and beautiful, but Charles doesn't have to worry about tourists taking home pieces of her monument as souvenirs.

Charles does an engaging job of telling us about the house that is more than a museum to him. Althorp does have many beautiful rooms  the wonderful ceilings are my particular favorites. The art collection is extensive. A very interesting part of the show is when we learn how the ancestors of George Washington were 2nd cousins who lived near-by.

Commentators include Charles Spencer (9th Earl Spencer), Diane Springett (Althorp guide), Cymon Snow (general manager, Sulgrave Manor), Bridget Barford (assistant housekeeper), Chris Leeson (gardener), Dr. Frances Harris (historian), Adey Greeno (head gamekeeper) and Jan Bialek (building manager).

The show originally aired in 2012 and is 56 minutes in length. If you purchase it on disc, English subtitles are available. There are no bonus features on the disc. ""The Secrets of Althorp"" is just one in a series. Five of the series' episodes can be purchased in a 5-DVD set,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Secrets-of-Iconic-British-Estates/dp/B00KX44RNO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Secrets of Iconic British Estates</a>.
