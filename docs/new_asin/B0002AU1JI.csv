8025283,5,B0002AU1JI,Any thing Bobby Fuller is in I love !!!,1513987200,,39,3.4444444444444446
8025284,3,B0002AU1JI,"From the seller's description, it was not clear this video was only a half hour long.  It's one episode of the program ""Colorado River Adventures"".  It was good quality and fun to watch.  However, there is also a 3 disc version on the market that has several episodes in it that would probably be a better value.",1491350400,2,312,4.43859649122807
8025285,5,B0002AU1JI,"If Robert Fuller is in it, I'll buy it.  Plain and simple.  He's my favorite cowboy.  Add the late, great Dan Haggerty and it's wonderful to see that gentle giant of a man again.  Love you, Dan!  Anyhow, Robert and Dan get googly over a deer fawn, take a locomotive train ride, hit the town in Vegas--then Robert heads off to Lake Mead where he has a blast tearing around on a jet-ski (Robert don't need no stunt guys).  This is a fun adventure for close friends that the audience gets to be a part of.  If you felt sad or depressed in any way when you started watching this DVD, you won't be when it's done.  This is totally life-affirming stuff and makes you appreciate the beauty of America.",1458604800,3,694,4.2846153846153845
8025286,5,B0002AU1JI,"Great......Any thing with Robert Fuller in it can't help but be great. I recieved my video very quickly and was undamaged.
I have bought mant items from Amazon, I have no complaints at all. They have low prices and great products.
