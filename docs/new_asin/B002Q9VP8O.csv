8377581,2,B002Q9VP8O,Ok the movie has some nice stunts but it reminds me to much of a motorcycle jack ass version. Hot woman and nice bikes is the only reason why i watched it till the end. Other than that its not worth the purchase.,1284940800,,212,3.953488372093023
8377582,5,B002Q9VP8O,"IF YOU ENJOYED THE 1ST ADRENALINE CREW DVD YOU'RE SHORE TO LIKE THIS ONE. IT HAS A NICE MIX AS ALWAYS OF DIF STUNTS, CRAZY BEHAVIOUR, SEXY WOMEN, HILARIOUS COMEDY AND SOME MOMENTS THAT MAKE YOU CRINGE AND JUST SAY ""DAMN THATS TOO MUCH!"" OVERALL 5 STARS FORSHORE, I HAVE A PRETTY BIG COLLECTION OF STUNT DVDS AND THIS I WOULD HAVE TO SAY IS THE BEST BY A LANDSLIDE ACTUALLY, THE STUNTING IS JUST RIDICULOUS....THE ACCIDENTS ARE CRAZY TOO, ONE CAT POPS A WHEELIE ON THE HIGHWAY COMES DOWN AND BOOM! ANOTHER DUDE WAS DRIFTING IN THE PARKING LIGHT LIKE HE WAS IN THE DIRT...PRETTY DAMN IMPRESSIVE! ITS AN AWESOME DVD AND I WOULD HIGHLY RECCOMEND IT. IF YOU HAVENT SEEN ANY OF THERE PREVIOUS DVDS THEY HAVE HIGHLIGHT REELS OF ALL OF THEM AND THEY'RE BADASS TOO. THE ONLY DOWNSIDE I WOULD SAY IS THAT THE MUSIC IS PRETTY HARDCORE ROCK, SOME GOOD MUSIC BUT SOME NOT SO GOOD...THOUGHT ID MENTION IT ON HERE AS IT CAN BE A DECIDING FACTOR FOR SOME WHEN PURCHASING A STUNT DVD.",1270598400,,967,4.377777777777778
