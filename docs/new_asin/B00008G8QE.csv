1844532,3,B00008G8QE,"The films were great, but the dvd company that put it out for some stupid reason had their logo plastered at the bottom right hand side of the screen throughout all the films. I'll never buy anything else by them.",1199923200,5,213,4.35
1844533,5,B00008G8QE,"My hubby liked this movie the most because of the 50's and early 60's cars shown parked and being driven in this sharp B and W movie.  Vincent Price is wonderful...this movie is the obvious precursor to Night of the Living Dead, and Charlton Heston's The  Omega Man. This is a wonderfully acted, greatly photographed early film.  This is truly a gem.

Discontinuities have to be forgiven, this is the proto-ur-zombie movie.  It is not bloody, but has it's psychological moments.",1168992000,2,478,4.851851851851852

1844707,1,B00008G8QE,"3 great horror movies on one DVD, but this is just a TERRIBLE copy.  House on Haunted Hill and Bat is ok, but Last Man on Earth is TERRIBLE video quality, and the sound isn't that good either.  Plus, even though all 3 movies are black and white, a red color ""Platinum disc"" label appears on the lower right part of the screen throughout the entire movies!  Distracting and ANNOYING!!!  I wouldn't give this DVD away.  I'm throwing it out and buying a new copy of all three movies.  Unfortunately, there's no way to know how to avoid the ""Platinum disc"" DVDs since nothing on the amazon.com page identifies this company.",1430352000,2,619,4.531531531531532
1844708,3,B00008G8QE,"I have always enjoyed anything with Vincent Price in it. This particular dvd had alot of potential.  Although when I put it in my player and started it I was disappointed.  The quality of the disc is horrible.  I shouldn't complain because it was so cheap. I should have remembered what my dad used to say, ""you get what you pay for"".",1427414400,,334,4.354838709677419
1844709,5,B00008G8QE,Great picture quality for black and white films. What's not to like about Vincent Price? I enjoyed all three films.,1421712000,,115,4.8

1844711,1,B00008G8QE,"The movies are great(the quality isn't the best, but not half bad), but there is an eyesore of a logo, and there seems to be no way to remove the logo. I'm not sure why any company thinks that people want to see their watermark at the bottom of the movie they are watching. I would suggest never buying anything from the Platinum Disc Corporation or as they're now known Echo Bridge Home Entertainment. The logo is bright red, which is especially annoying during a black and white film! The logo even for the cheap price makes this anything but worthwhile. I would suggest everyone get the better quality double feature of House on Haunted Hill/The Bat and one of the other single choices for Last Man On Earth. You could also get the double feature for Last Man on Earth with Panic Year Zero. Regardless, choose elsewhere unless you like distracting logos.",1413158400,6,857,4.607843137254902
1844712,5,B00008G8QE,"House On Haunted Hill
Shock Theatre veteran Vincent Price stars in this cult classic as Frederick Loren, a baleful tycoon who owns an ominous mental institution-turned-mansion. Loren throws a party that promises to be a hauntingly good time but turns into a murderous disaster. With his foes in attendance, Loren hands out party favors in the form of miniature wooden coffins that contain handguns. The ominous host has a few scary tricks up his sleeve that he hopes will provoke his guests into using their weapons, but it turns out that his calculating wife and her lover have some plans of their own. All of the devious scheming and backstabbing of the guests, mixed in with the house's own malevolent supernatural element, make for one terrifying, white-knuckled, fright night. 1958 / 75 MIN. / B&W / RATED 13

The Bat
The setting of this murder mystery takes place at a proverbial old, dark, and creepy mansion leased for the summer by Cornelia Van Gorder (Agnes Moorehead), an eccentric mystery writer who finds inspiration for her novels in her eerie surroundings. But soon after Cornelia moves in, it seems as if one of her diabolical mysteries has sprung to life when a strange prowler, who is later dubbed ""The Bat"", breaks into the mansion clad in a fedora, mask, and gloves outfitted that are outfitted with razor-sharp metal claws. ""The Bat"" terrorizes Cornelia and her maid, committing an atrocious murder and threatening the frightened novelist - until she decides to get to the bottom of the mystery by turning the tables on the vile villain.  1959 / 80 MIN. / B&W / RATED 13

The Last Man On Earth
A sinister plague sweeps the earth, transforming humankind into a race of vampire-like monsters. Every human on earth becomes infected - with the exception of one man - scientist Robert Morgan (Vincent Price), who is inexplicably immune to the affliction. Morgan, the last vestige of the human race, takes it upon himself to wipe out the vampire race - one monster at a time. When he restores a woman back to her old self with a blood transfusion, involving his own blood, the scientist is given hope that he will be able to cure others. But his plans fall to the wayside when the vampire race tracks him down, in order to slay their sole threat. Now Morgan must figure out a way to save himself if he has any hope of restoring humanity.  1964 / 86 MIN. / B&W / RATED 18",1349136000,,2385,4.657957244655582
1844713,2,B00008G8QE,When watching the movie I noticed the logo Platinum Disc at the bottom right hand corner of the screen and it would not go away even after the movie started. The menu has no setup to get rid of it and worse than that the logo was underlined in red so it was a real eye sore to watch the movie. I would have never bought it if I knew that. Love the movies but hate the logo.,1248048000,11,373,3.7948717948717947
1844714,5,B00008G8QE,"I am from the Baby Boomer generation who lived for those saturday afternoons at the movies. And especially the Science Fiction ones. Our movies would have 3 cartoons, Coming Attractions and 2 Sci Fi movies...all of that for 35 cents! Life was good in the 50s! I am a BIG Vincent Price Fan! I love all of his movies. And the trio on this DVD happens to be three of my very favorites. So I was thrilled to find it on Amazon! All three movies are GREAT and you will be happy to see them again. A real Collector's joy to own and can see on your own time. Have FUN...and bring the Popcorn and enjoy the sheer genius of Vincent Price. He will always entertain!",1216598400,5,654,4.198412698412699
7983172,2,B00008G8QE,"Vincent Price is a treasure and these movies are all amazing, the transfer quality is good, not great, but passable. The reason I'm not giving this compilation a 4 star rating is the Platinum Disc watermark at the bottom right hand corner of the screen, which never goes away and has red in the logo, so it's a constant distraction, while watching the film...",1524441600,,359,4.625

7983178,3,B00008G8QE,"why?  This is not a cable channel that can advertise with logo, this is something we buy and should not be there at all after the movie starts..
But what makes it even worse, the logo is white and red  so on B&W films it really stands out.
(to be fair, it does fade out now and then but not for more than 30 seconds or so)

Poor copies of the films, but still watchable.

Having said that, at the current price of only three dollars it makes it worth buying if only to watch each movie one time in my opinion.

Love the movies themselves, but have to go with three Amazon stars for ""it's OK"" because of the low quality and stupid logo on screen.",1465603200,,645,4.047244094488189
