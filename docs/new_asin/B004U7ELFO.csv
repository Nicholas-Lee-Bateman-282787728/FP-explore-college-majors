8441270,1,B004U7ELFO,The movie is fine but why is Amazon selling re-recorded versions? This is such low quality that I cannot even read the intertitles. In addition the music cuts out for a second every few minutes or so. This is terrible Amazon.,1493596800,5,225,4.512195121951219

8441272,1,B004U7ELFO,Another rip-off cheaply burnt DVD-R. Why these things are allowed to be sold here is beyond me!,1418083200,2,95,4.647058823529412
8441273,1,B004U7ELFO,"It's a product of the days of silent-film. Perhaps I would have loved it in 1925, but yesterday I found it to be tedious in the extreme.  Watching it in its entirety was an exercise in self-discipline.  If you're a masochist or have an academic or historical interest in such old films, then there may be something in it for you.  Otherwise, I can't recommend putting yourself through it.",1417564800,4,388,4.594202898550725
8441274,5,B004U7ELFO,"Clara Bow is timeless and amazing, just like Shirley Temple, and anything that she is in is wonderful.",1414627200,3,102,4.722222222222222
8441275,5,B004U7ELFO,"Clara Bow has surprisingly little to do in this movie. She disappears for most of the movie, which concentrates on Wallace MacDonald as a poor man lured into crime.

This is interesting as an early example of a gangster film. The scenes are pretty stagey even by 1925 standards. The director seems heavily influenced by D.W. Griffith in that it is a moralistic melodrama.

However there is enough emotional material here to get you caught up in it. I especially liked the sweet and loving relationship between MacDonald and his young nephew. For lover's of silent films, a five, but people who don't like silent films should stay away.",1369785600,10,635,4.81651376146789
8441276,3,B004U7ELFO,"Story line was not interesting so much so, that I don't remember watching the end! She came in to her own,so to speak,with 1926's ""Mantrap"" and 1927 with ""It"" and ""Wings"". Clara Bow fans, these are three films you want to see. Mantrap was supposedly her favorite.",1367539200,5,263,4.617021276595745
