8418274,2,B0047O2FLW,This fantastic film short showing virtually all the movie stars if the 20s and 30s is presented in a cheap grainy format. It would be great if it could be cleaned up and presented in a restored form. Sadly it is a public domain release. Joan Crawford and the host of heaven (MGM Stars) appear with others and generally cause riotous laughter. See it just for the spectacle. No special features,1504569600,,393,4.549295774647887
8418275,3,B0047O2FLW,"In all honesty, I only bought this for the brief tete-a-tete scene between William Haines and Joan Crawford.  It just goes to show you what lengths a William Haines fan will go to, to have every second of Haines screen time in their collection.  The other feature of this dvd is the add on ""Mud and Sand"" starring an early Stan Laurel, who plays a Spanish bullfighter.  Very unlike his later collaboration with Oliver Hardy, Laurel plays a more expansive, independent character.",1434499200,,478,4.804878048780488
