7430256,5,B0157TI7OE,Fabulous documentary. As a Korean Adoptee its often difficult to describe the feelings that ones has; this was a remarkable journey for these two beautiful women.,1445040000,,162,5.269230769230769
7430257,5,B0157TI7OE,"I came to watch this film after HelloHannahCho recommended it. It is a very beautiful film/documentary. I am not adopted but I always empathize with this kinds of stories. I was born with a birth defect, My eyes are very very small and look very asian. I have two brothers like Sam and so much like Anas, I grew up in an small town where being different was reason to bully. I was mocked and torture since I can remember because I don't look like my parents or siblings to the point where I developed depression and even suicide. I felt that I can somehow relate to them a bit at least in those levels. I am loved by parents and sibling but I always felt alone and lost. This story brought a lot of painful memories but it also heal some of those wounds. I am so happy that they found each other and had each other support throughout this crazy and eventful journey. And they will have each for the rest of their lives. It is sad that they have individual lives so distant from each other. I wish them all the best and every one who is an adoptee or has felt like a stranger. Thank you. :D",1445040000,15,1089,4.165876777251185
7430258,5,B0157TI7OE,What a beautiful movie! I cried through out the whole thing. So happy they found each other and so sorry they were ever separated.,1444867200,,130,4.458333333333333
7430259,5,B0157TI7OE,What a wonderful movie.  Unlike most documentaries the movie happens in real time.  Samantha Futerman and her friends started documenting what was happening in her life as soon as she realized what was happening.  Not just for people with/who are twins.  For anybody interested in a very intimate portrayal of a very unusual and serendipitous example of our online lives.,1444867200,3,371,5.133333333333334

7430262,5,B0157TI7OE,It was great to witness their discovery of one another.  I was especially moved by the support from family and friends.,1465257600,,119,4.666666666666667
7430263,5,B0157TI7OE,What a great documentary!  Watches this movie with my wife and we both enjoyed it a lot.  It was very interesting to see the differences and similarities of the sisters who were raised apart in different countries.  It's amazing how every step of their reunification was documented by video and not recreated.,1463097600,,309,4.903846153846154

7430270,5,B0157TI7OE,"I just watched this on a whim. Wow. I don't know really how to explain it except perhaps it was the greatest love story ever. It was simply an amazing watch to see two people come back together.

It was also great that Samantha had some background in cinema, it made this documentary very nice and professional. I hope she is no longer waiting tables.",1459728000,,351,4.4
7430271,5,B0157TI7OE,"One of my favorite documentaries!  it'a a wonderful, true story of sisters who find each other through social media.  I just love the love that Sam and Anas share for one another even though they grew up apart in different countries and in different families. Love watching their journey from beginning to end!  Well-made movie!",1459036800,,328,4.927272727272728
7430272,5,B0157TI7OE,"Twinsters is a heartfelt documentary that captures the true meaning of family. It beautifully captures the journey of two young women, Sam and Anas, discovering their sisterhood.

The film is most interesting at the times when you can see how similar the girls actually are and watch their connection develop over time. There are many funny and charming scenes throughout the film that will definitely have you smiling and laughing along with the girls. While the movie is light-hearted, it can be quite emotional. While these emotional moments are not necessarily sad, you will definitely find yourself feeling happy for the girls, so happy that it might even jerk some happy tears.

The film is not only unique because of the interesting story it tells, but also because it uses the advancement of todays technology to its advantage. The viewer reads the messages the girls are exchanging and watches their Skype sessions in real time. Due to this, you feel as if you are actually apart of Sam and Anas journey, learning more about them, as the girls learn more about each other.

This is definitely a documentary to watch if you are interested in a heartwarming film that tells the meaningful story of long lost twins that reconnect and learn the true meaning of family and unconditional love.",1458950400,,1296,4.908675799086758

7430274,5,B0157TI7OE,"Considering the cost to make this documentary (funded by a couple of Kickstarter campaigns), the end product is an amazing documentary that is full of heart, soul, and style. Extremely enjoyable watch and totally engrossing.  Highly recommended.",1454284800,,245,5.621621621621622
7430275,4,B0157TI7OE,"Very interesting, enlightening, sweet, and poignant. Could use a bar of soap for the potty mouth twin.",1453939200,,102,5.0588235294117645
7430276,4,B0157TI7OE,Truly heartwarming,1453507200,,18,8.5
7430277,5,B0157TI7OE,"Even though I had read their book (and had seen other videos), it was nice to see this ""official"" documentary. One reviewer called it self-serving, but their story is so amazing and unbelievable, I'm glad it was captured on video for all of us to watch it unfold.

There are many facets of their experience which make it more unusual than the typical reunited-siblings story: being identical, being from different countries, being Korean, having or not having siblings, having different personalities and accents.

(Spoilers ahead, if you haven't seen it yet). The most interesting part is how their face-to-face meeting is not what I expected. Instead of the expected hugs and jumping for joy, they are wary and amazed and confused when they see their other self enter the room. The emotions are often subtle (based on how I saw them), such as being part of a Korean adoptees group, or suddenly having a person closer than your closest family member show up out of nowhere. It must be quite a shock to one's idea of ""this is who I am"".

They share the happiness of having a twin, yet also the separation of living in different parts of the world. Which is another story: they start out as two individuals making their way into the adult world, and end up crossing continents and finding ""family"" in three widely-separated parts of the Earth. How mind-blowingly weird is that?!

The cover photo is very touching, because it shows them together as they started out in life, but 25 years later.",1451260800,7,1492,4.749034749034749
7430278,4,B0157TI7OE,I wish it was a little deeper and touched more on the birth mother aspect.  it's a great positive spin on international adoption !,1450828800,2,130,4.416666666666667
7430279,5,B0157TI7OE,"I'm an adopted Korean, and I was really excited that this movie was available on Amazon. Sure, it was a bit disappointing to see it come up on my netflix selection a month later, but I think it's worth supporting. It's such a unique and heart warming story that is also bittersweet. I've recommended it to all of my friends, and everyone that has seen it has taken a moment to tell me how touching and interesting it was!",1450310400,2,421,4.341772151898734
7430280,5,B0157TI7OE,Touching movie! Very enjoyable and kept my interest the entire time.,1449532800,,68,5.2727272727272725
7430281,5,B0157TI7OE,"I loved it from start to finish! It gives new meaning to the term ""Blended Family"" because they as they got to know each other, they all became one large family. I have an adopted brother and I think it might have been nice to have seen and gotten to know his biological family. But he did that after he grew up. I'm so happy for both of these girls and hope some day their birth mother will get to see this DVD so she can see how much of a blessing she is to so many people in allowing them to get adopted. And now she has a chance to receive a huge blessing herself!",1449446400,,568,3.9051724137931036
7430282,5,B0157TI7OE,Interesting & sweet. Watched it with my Twin daughters. We all liked it.,1449014400,,72,4.615384615384615
7430283,4,B0157TI7OE,"A surprisingly engrossing film! The beginning was a bit slow but it picked up pretty quickly. My wife and I enjoyed this film immensely. The girls are very young and the youthful approach is a bit hard to understand (the constant use of the word ""pop"" was difficult to fathom). However, it was easy to understand the depth of feeling between these girls.  The sisters epitomize the need to connect to those who are ""like us"". It was particularly heartwarming to see how much the people who loved this sisters rejoiced when they found each other. Nicely paced. A beautiful story.",1448582400,6,578,4.7227722772277225

7430285,2,B0157TI7OE,"This should have been a 20 minute short subject on 60 minutes.  Instead, it's the vanity project of an insipid and immature 25 year old (going on 15) whose every other word is ""like"" and who is incapable of comporting herself like an adult. Prepare for 90 minutes of teenage giggling.",1448496000,,284,4.568627450980392

7430287,5,B0157TI7OE,"Beautifully done and especially appealing to teens and young adults, Twinsters tells a meaningful story that will bless everyone.  Very moving.  The images and conversations stay with you for a long time and you realize more how precious loving one another is.  I found it drew me closer to God.",1448064000,2,295,4.86

7430290,5,B0157TI7OE,Loved it!!! Quite emotional if you are a twin.,1447632000,,46,4.222222222222222
7430291,5,B0157TI7OE,"If you've been adopted, questioned who your biological parents were due to genetics or just are into the ""Parent Trap"" sort of situations where two people learn they are not only related, that despite being raised in entirely different backgrounds are sooo similar then you'll love Twinsters.  No spoiler alerts necessary here, but the story of Samantha Futerman and Anais  Bordier is a real tear jerker, funny and delightfully refreshing, all in one. And it all came about because friends of these young ladies realized their similarities after watching Youtube videos.  The Internet and modern technology are truly helping to reunite lost souls in this expansive world.",1447372800,4,671,5.252336448598131
7430292,5,B0157TI7OE,I really enjoyed the documentary of the ID Twins.  I 'm also an ID twin that live 3K miles apart for the last 25 years.  Yours story really got to my heart.  LOVE IT,1447113600,,165,3.7941176470588234
7430293,5,B0157TI7OE,This documentary was awesome! What a remarkable and beautiful story. I can't remember the last time I watched a documentary that made me feel so many different emotions within such a short time frame. The documentary was very well put together from the editing to the music to the animation. The story-telling was outstanding and kept me engaged. After having watched this movie I can't help but want to keep up with their story. There is a whole world of discovery for them and I hope they find what they're looking for. Many thanks for sharing your story with us. POP!,1447027200,6,570,4.653465346534653
7430294,5,B0157TI7OE,"Was all teers through most of it.  Especially loved when they first met in person and stayed a few feet apart, not quite knowing what to do.  Then Anais pokes her sister to make sure it was real . . .",1447027200,,200,3.8536585365853657
