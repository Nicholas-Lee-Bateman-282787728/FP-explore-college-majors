You do get to hear this great band live but they need to find a better mastertape. Or another concert like the dvd featured here which is the band in 78 and it's just awesome , the sound and power are all there to enjoy and the show was shot professionally too.  the cd's are from years earlier and are decent at best in quality. YOu can buy these cds seperate and the dvd seperate too. Or buy this double pack and get them both now. THe other review is about a beatles item and should not be on here by the way.",1288396800,2,644,4.062992125984252
8173838,1,B000MZYGLC,"This DVD is nothing , but each clip was  Badly ripped off from the Beatles Anthology Box 5 DVD set.

Some like, Hey jude, it was jump cut to avoid the members interview scene.

Poorly arranged and probably ripped and put together someone's computer and Editing

clips were poorly organized.

If you want to buy the Beatles clips, buy the official anthology Box set rather than

this bootleg type.

I do not understand why ZMAZON would allow this kind of DVD for the market place.",1171756800,,479,4.564705882352941
