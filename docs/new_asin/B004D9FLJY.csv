4331738,3,B004D9FLJY,"I do enjoy watching the musical performances, but thought this was a Encore CD showcasing the best of music from the first 2 seasons, which would have been awesome.  Maybe in the future.  I do think the songs this DVD has a lot of the best!",1302134400,,240,4.195652173913044
4331739,1,B004D9FLJY,The DVDs already have a feature that allows you to watch just the musical performances. So why on Earth would you buy a DVD that does the same exact thing? I do not get it. I love Glee and I am a self admitted Gleek but this set is just a big waste of money that can be saved to buy the Season 2 DVD or Blu Ray set.,1301702400,14,315,3.579710144927536
4331740,2,B004D9FLJY,"This is a great option for those who don't already own the Glee DVD's. I'd buy it if I hadn't Gleeked out and purchased the Season 1 DVD's and Season 2, Part 1 DVD's already. For those who *do* own the DVDs, just check out the extras' section. There's something called a ""Glee Jukebox"" that basically replays the musical numbers again! :)",1301356800,17,338,4.467741935483871
4331741,5,B004D9FLJY,"My 7 1/2 yr. old granddaughter loves the music & dancing on Glee, but is too young for the mature themes. This will be an excellent alternative! THANKS Fox!!",1300838400,20,157,4.448275862068965
4331742,4,B004D9FLJY,"I am a big glee fan and I think this set is a good idea.  I imagine there are a lot of Glee fans like me who watch primarily for the musical numbers.  What kept me from giving this five stars is the fact it is missing a few great numbers.  I really would have like to  have seen  the performances for ""She's having my Baby"", ""Poker Face"", ""My life would suck without You"" and ""Somwhere over the rainbow"" included.  I will problably still buy it but will have to go back to the season blu-rays to watch those numbers.  Seems a shame.",1300492800,56,532,4.106796116504855
4331743,1,B004D9FLJY,"I can't believe anyone likes this show or would buy this DVD! The show is terrible! Singing in hallways? Singing on football fields? Singing in coffee shops? Singing at the Dentist? No thanks, not my thing. If you want to watch a musical, that's fine, go see one on broadway or rent an old movie. Please do not pollute our public airways with this musical nonsense though. Plus these kids are terrible role models for our children. Don't even get me started on Kurt and his reprehensible actions, or the pregnant teen for that matter. Those two deserve all the slushies. The only thing good about this show is that it shows us all how NOT to act and what NOT to do. As if a season release of this show wasn't terrible enough, now we have to sit through this 2 hours long disc? NO THANKS!!! This a terrible show and a terrible product.",1300060800,4,834,4.387096774193548
4331744,5,B004D9FLJY,I'm a HUGE fan of Glee.  This is By far the BEST SHOW on TV. I have seen them in Concert and So looking forward to thier 2011 Tour!!! Got my tickets already.. The Show is Amazing and this will showcase the incredible performances !!!!!  I'm Pre ordering this now !!!!  ~~^~~,1299542400,9,274,4.230769230769231
4331745,5,B004D9FLJY,I am thrilled this dvd is coming out.  My boys are too young for the mature content of the show but love the musical performances.  Now I can have them watch without having to be ready to skip through the inappropriate (for a 9 year old)content.,1299196800,81,245,4.304347826086956
4331746,2,B004D9FLJY,"With this DVD release, FOX has clearly demonstrated that they are going to milk the cash cow that is Glee for all its worth. In case you're wondering what exactly this latest Glee DVD entails, it is essentially a collection of 30 or so Glee musical numbers. It is important to note that none of these numbers are extended, nor have they been specially released just for this DVD. The fact is, that ALL these musical numbers are from the first season, and if you own the first season on DVD or Blu-ray, you already have these numbers to watch. I am curious as to whom this product is aimed, people who don't watch the show or own the first season, or perhaps diehard fans who would just like the convenience of having all their favorite Glee musical numbers offered in one place without having to skip through their DVD season 1 set? Either way, this set brings nothing new to the table. So, unless you have never seen the show and want to use this as a mildly affordable introduction to it or maybe if you are having a ""Glee Party"" and want this playing in the background, I would recommend against purchasing this product as the average Glee fan and Amazon shopper most likely will already have access to this hodge-podge of Glee musical numbers. The DVD is entitled ""Encore,"" and an encore is by definition more of the same, however encores typically do not cost extra and are simply a free added bonus to a program. A true encore would have been included as a bonus disc with the first season release. So with this ""encore,"" it will be up to individual Glee fans to decide whether its worth it to pay for something they already own.",1299110400,66,1635,4.453333333333333

Looks like she had the most and then came the main guy and then  well everybody else. don't get me wrong I did enjoy this and that goes for most of the songs, I see this is from season one, no more after?

4331758,4,B004D9FLJY,"This is a fantastic song list from the first season, but since not all songs are included, the end credits need to be truncated, as they include ALL of the season's end credits, accounting for the final 10+ minutes. If all songs had been included, this would make sense, but since they aren't, it's a waste of time. Plus, the songs included aren't always the most popular of the season either. Either way though, it's a great addition for any Gleek to have.

I wish something like this had been released for the remaining seasons.",1422403200,,530,4.578947368421052

4331781,4,B004D9FLJY,"I recieved this as a Christmas present this year and I had to say I'm really happy with it. Already I've watched it a couple times just letting it play while I'm off doing other things. Because of the option to play all I'm able to leave the tv and still listen to the music without the distraction that watching the actual show always becomes for me. The performances are some of my favorite and also some that I forgot glee had ever done. Overall, I think it's a worthwhile buy for hardcore Glee fans who just want something fun to add to their collection.",1356480000,,558,4.3238095238095235
4331782,5,B004D9FLJY,"I really liked this blu-ray Glee, great to see the songs this way. The audio is good, could be a little louder, but still good. I liked the option in which the songs are performed randomly. I recommend to all.",1350432000,,209,4.25
4331783,5,B004D9FLJY,"I received the product promptly and as promised, brand new! I love that I can pop this blu-ray and just listen and/or watch the videos.",1349913600,,135,4.44
4331784,3,B004D9FLJY,"So everywhere I turn I keep hearing about how great a TV series GLEE is. My sister and her family are GLEE addicts. There are magazines, games, buttons and more adorned with the GLEE logo and actors. So what makes it so special? My guess, from watching this DVD, is the music.

Having still not seen the series, I gather that it revolves around a group of high school teens who aren't a part of the ""popular crowd"" that become involved in the school's glee club (what we used to call the choir). Each episode includes a musical performance, many of which use popular songs. And that's what this DVD is all about.

There isn't much acting ability that can be deciphered watching someone sing a song no matter how much you like the song or how much emotion the singer can put into it's performance. But you can enjoy the music and the vocal abilities of the singer. That's what this is all about.

Each of the actors singing here (and I for one hope that each of them does their own singing and isn't being dubbed each week) does a stand up job and come off incredibly well. I don't see them selling billions of CDs on their own but as part of this group they should do well.

So what songs do they offer? Here is a list for those interested:

""On My Own""
""Don't Stop Believin'""
""Gold Digger""
""I Say a Little Prayer""
""Alone""
""Somebody to Love""
""It's My Life/Confessions Part II""
""No Air""
""You Keep Me Hanging On""
""Defying Gravity""
""I'll Stand By You""
""Don't Stand So Close to Me/Young Girl""
""Lean on Me""
""Imagine""
""True Colors""
""Smile""
""Don't Rain on My Parade""
""You Can't Always Get What You Want""
""Gives You Hell""
""Hello""
""Vogue""
""Like a Virgin""
""Like a Prayer""
""Fire""
""One Less Bell to Answer/A House is Not a Home""
""Beautiful""
""Run Joey Run""
""Total Eclipse of the Heart""
""Jessie's Girl""
""Rose's Turn""
""Bad Romance""
""Beth""
""Faithfully""
""Any Way You Want It/Lovin' Touchin' Squeezin'""

One thing to note about these selections. I've talked to kids in their 20s and late teens and trust me, most of them wouldn't recognize these songs if it weren't for this show. None of them would know who Burt Bacharach, Bonnie Tyler, Journey, The Rascals or Bill Withers are nor would they care. Which is kind of sad since it means they are missing so much great music that exist and only care about what's current. With any luck by watching this show perhaps a few of them will seek out the original artists and discover what they're missing. Until then they can enjoy the songs they love from the show with this disc and then maybe one day their children will seek out the originals.",1332201600,2,2572,4.485042735042735
4331785,5,B004D9FLJY,I love it! I am such a huge gleek! This is a must have for all glee fans! Makes me want to watch all the episodes again.,1325376000,,120,3.4814814814814814
4331786,4,B004D9FLJY,"A great glee DVD! You can play individual songs organized by episode. You can ""play all"" in order by episode. Or you can play a mix play all where it changes up the order of all of the songs...The only thing I wish is that when set on mix it would just keep playing without stopping...Once it has played all songs it runs through the credits of every single episode...It takes forever to get through...But you just hit the menu button and play them again and you are fine.

On the song note: I am a huge glee fan, a gleek if you will and I have a bone to pick with this DVD. I believe they missed out on three major songs in this collection. They do not have ""Proud Mary - Rolling on River"" which the kids preformed in wheelchairs...They do not have the cheer-leading song sung by Kurt and Mercedes ""4 minutes""...And they do not have the girls mash up of ""Halo"" and ""Walking on Sunshine""...I can understand missing ""4 minutes"" because it is not really about the Cheerios its about Kurt and Mercedes, but missing out on Artie's tribute with the wheelchairs was ridiculous. They have ""Run Joey Run"", Rachel's audition song ""On my own"" (Which is good on recording but not in the episode), and they have ""One Less Bell to Answer/A House is Not a Home"" mash up between April and Mr. Shue...Any of which I could have done without. Then, they include the boys mash up but not the girls, that is just wrong. I guess I just wanted a DVD with all of the music videos and none of the drama.

Still great for the money but not exactly what I was looking for.",1320192000,4,1546,4.291095890410959

There were a few that were cut out like Take a Bow, Taking Chances, Halo/Walking on Sunshine, Keep Holding On, My Life Would Suck Without You, Borderline/Open Your Heart etc.  I paid around $9 for this DVD, but I probably wouldn't pay over $15 for it. It's just the performances from Season 1... nothing else. Overall.. it's a great DVD with great performances from Season 1. Hopefully they'll be coming out with a Vol. 2 for all the Season 2 performaces because I will DEFINITELY be buying it. :)",1316822400,2,646,4.6173913043478265

I had hoped it would be all music videos, but I guess they don't make music videos anymore.  Instead, they give you rehashed performances taken straight from the TV show, with no added production or introduction of the song.  In fact, in one of the numbers, part of the credits shown during the TV show, appears; they couldn't even edit that out?  Rent it.",1311292800,3,512,4.521739130434782

4331800,3,B004D9FLJY,"I am so happy that they made a separate DVD of the songs!  Because I can put this in and my 4-year-old can watch just the songs, without me having to fast-forward through the (age-inappropriate) show itself.  I still have to look out for the inappropriate songs, but that's easy enough.

The only negative thing I have to say about this is that they didn't include all the songs -- and they really made you miss the songs that weren't included by having pictures from those songs on the song menu.  For example, from the episode ""Jump"", they didn't bother to include ""Jump"" (um, duh) but had a pic from that song right next to the available song choices from that episode.

My only real beef with this disc is that they should have just gone straight through the episodes and included all of the songs -- especially since the first season didn't have the ""jukebox"" feature on the dvds until the 5th disc or so.  If they had just released one that had all the songs that weren't on jukebox, that would be enough.  Now, I still have to search through the actual episodes to play my kid's favorite songs for her (she sings and dances along, it's awesome).",1306886400,,1152,4.457142857142857
4331801,4,B004D9FLJY,"I'm a big Glee fan and I love watching it on DVD when I'm running on the treadmill. Sometimes I just want to hear (and see) the songs without the storyline... so that's when I watch the Glee encore! It's just a series of songs exactly as they appear on the show, back to back. Like other reviewers, I would have liked to see some of my other favorites (Push It, Take a Bow, Jump), but maybe those will come in a future volume!",1305849600,,426,4.083333333333333
4331802,3,B004D9FLJY,I adore Glee and have done so since first seeing the directors cut. When I found out there was going to be a DVD concentrating solely on the music scenes of Glee I thought it would be the best thing since sliced bread. However when this long anticipated item arrived I was a tad disappointed by the whole product. Don't get me wrong I would purchase it again in a heart beat but it has the signs of being put together hastily to cash in on Glee's popularity. The list of songs are on the inside cover and are extremely difficult to read against the orange background. The editing is TERRIBLE and whoever did it should be ashamed of themselves. When you watch Glee primarily for the over the moon choreography and musical interpretations of the songs selected to fit into each episodes story line and then put this on and select play all your sense are in for a rude awakening. It leaps from one song to another with no proper interval of showing on-screen which song is going to be sung. Of course you could sit there with the cover moving it around in different positions and squinting to try and read the order of the songs but it would have a far more polished and professional feel to it if the name of the song was placed on screen prior to listening to it. As I said a tad disappointing.,1305590400,3,1293,4.325102880658436
4331803,4,B004D9FLJY,"I love that this has many of the songs we enjoy. But I hate that so many songs are not on here. How did they pick & choose? I dunno.

I thought this was going to be perfect for my 7yr old because there would be no inappropriate content, but to my surprise ""Like a Virgin"" is one of the songs LOL So we have to skip that one but all the others are great. We love it! And it looks great in bluray.

The main menu is a bit annoying. I expected it to be easier to get to the song you wanted, but you fist have to go to the Episode, only then will it show you the songs. Maybe it's just my bluray player?",1305158400,3,599,3.7086614173228347
4331804,3,B004D9FLJY,I was really disappointed to find they left off Colfer's singing of A House is Not a Home even tho' it's on the list.  All there is is a piece of the song sung by Chenowith. That song sung by Colfer is my favorite of the first season.  We got gypped !,1305072000,6,251,3.8076923076923075
4331805,2,B004D9FLJY,"I am a self-professed Gleek. I have all the cd's and dvd's that they have released, so when I saw this one, I knew I had to have it. I wish I had saved my money! Watching just the dance numbers is no fun at all and then they aren't even the complete performances! You're better off just buying the different seasons as they come out and watch them that way. They don't include some of the better dance sequences like ""Jump"" and the Halo/Walking on Sunshine mash up. If I had to do it all over again, I wouldn't spend the money on this disc.",1304985600,26,540,4.10377358490566
4331806,2,B004D9FLJY,"I love this show, although I think the way they're going with Sue Sylvester this season is way over the top. And if they make it all a dream sequence, I might have to hurt someone.

But I digress.

Let me tell you what I usually do: I'll tape the newest episode, copy it to DVD, and then copy the musical numbers that strike me the most. I thought this collection would save me the trouble, especially since I didn't get into Glee until the middle of Season 1. And when I found it in Target for $10, I thought it would be a great buy.

It's not, and seriously, don't waste your money. The numbers end by fading to black, often chopping off small bits that I personally felt would have been relevant. (I always add to the beginning and the end for context, and I missed that in this DVD.) If I wanted just the music, I would have bought the CDs. I also didn't like the fact that the numbers weren't listed on the back of the case.

Would I buy an Encore if it came out for Season 2? Maybe, but this time I'd research it a bit more, especially since so many songs were left out of Encore for Season 1.

Oh, wait, I get it! They're going to release an Encore Volume 2 for Season 1!

Now that's just greedy.

Save your money and buy the entire season.",1304726400,,1247,4.086065573770492
4331807,3,B004D9FLJY,"I believe that the people at FOX have discovered just how much money Glee can make them with all the singles and CD's and Valentine Cards, underwear, posters and now an upcoming 3-D concert movie?  Don't get me wrong, I love the show but why release this with only some of the songs?  Why not wait a few months and put all of season 1 and 2's numbers together? Especially you are actually rebuying what is on the actual box sets.
Of course not, FOX will not only come out with the Volume One and Two of each season but also the entire season box sets and now the Best of segments.
I think they are going a bit overboard but probably realize that with anything it runs it's course and Glee will most likely do that in another couple of years. A show like this has a limited shelf life. Look at Sue now. Once  everyone's favorite wise ass has turned into a caracture and is so evil that you just want to fast forward her scenes. The joke of her hating the Glee club is real old.",1304467200,,976,4.1534391534391535
4331808,1,B004D9FLJY,"Many of the best songs from season one are not on this dvd.  Very disappointed.  I will stick to the ""Juke Box"" on the Extras of the Season One DVD.",1304467200,2,148,3.9
4331809,3,B004D9FLJY,"This DVD has a great selection of songs from season 1, but it has a few oddballs and a few blaringly missing songs. We don't really need Fire or Alone (though I do love Alone - but the extended version that was released for CD/iTunes, not this teeny little clip), On My Own, Say a Little Prayer, etc. I realize many love those songs, but if it comes to including them, or deleting them in favor of a few more important numbers, I say get rid of them. Don't Stop Believin' regionals version, Over the Rainbow, My Life Would Suck Without You, I Dreamed a Dream, Halo/Walkin' on Sunshine, Keep Holding On, etc - those should all be here, and they're not. I would like to see a second volume from season 1 with more stuff.",1304380800,8,718,4.286764705882353
4331810,5,B004D9FLJY,"Alright, I'm seeing a lot of people talking about the fact that there are songs missing from this set. Yep, there are. And I was one of the folks who felt like they should have made an ENTIRE Season 1 set. I figure this was a test run, and if it sold well (As if there were any chance that wasn't happening. LOL), then they can release the rest of the songs, or ALL of Season 1, or, and this is most likely, both... When they released a limited edition Complete Season 1 music collection, it was snapped up at lightning speed, and now sells for almost $100. (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Glee-the-Music-Complete-Season/dp/B004GLDNO4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Glee: the Music-Complete Season</a>) So yeah, I wish this had the entire Season 1 worth of songs. But I'd rather focus on what IS here, rather than what is NOT.
  These aren't just the songs. These are the performances from the show. I figure that's why so many are missing. They included the ones that were longer, it seems. Among the best on the disk, IMHO, are: Don't Stop Believin' (Pilot Version), Somebody To Love, It's My Life/Confessions Part II, No Air, Defying Gravity (Which I am listening to right now.), Lean On Me, Imagine, Don't Rain On My Parade, Vogue, Like A Prayer, Beautiful, Total Eclipse of the Heart, Rose's Turn, Bad Romance, Faithfully, and Any Way You Want It/Lovin', Touchin', Squeezin'. And many more. And best of all, there's a shuffle function, which is GREAT. So, do I wish it was the entire Season's worth of songs? Sure. But for the price, it is WELL worth it. I still give it a solid A+, 5 star rating, and I can't imagine anyone enjoying this less just because there are fewer songs. Most of us Gleeks own every single DVD and CD or song anyway. LOL
  So give this a try folks. I don't think you'll be disappointed. Thank you for your time.
  Sincerely, R.A. McDowell",1304121600,7,1903,4.786585365853658
4331811,3,B004D9FLJY,"I've been waiting for this type of DVD to be released (c'mon, we all knew it was going to happen). My obsession with Glee is based 80% on the musical numbers and only 20% on the inane plot lines, so I really welcome the opportunity to pop a DVD in the player and watch nothing but singing/dancing. Since this has been my sole desire all along, I've refrained from buying the seasons, so, yes, I will probably purchase this item.

However, my big complaint is similar to the others I've read here - the producers of this DVD failed to select many of the musical numbers that *I* most wish to watch. How could they possibly overlook Neil Patrick Harris belting out Aerosmith's ""Dream On""? Or a field of uniformed football jocks dancing along with ""Single Ladies""?

In my opinion, the best part of the Glee merchandising mega-franchise are the CD recordings that allow us to hear the actors singing the FULL song versions, rather than the edited down bits and pieces that are necessary in order to cram 5 or 6 numbers into a 42 minute time slot. I would really love to see a DVD that features new and complete music videos, but I suppose the overworked and sore-footed cast has no time for this. They should put one out anyway, and just price the DVD at $100 to make up for the trouble. People would buy still buy it. Whiny pre-teens can be very persuasive.",1304121600,,1354,4.455645161290323
4331812,4,B004D9FLJY,"I'm a childless adult, so the show's content doesn't bother me. This DVD is a great idea if you like the musical numbers, but you're missing out on the show's acting and stories. For those parents who don't like the mature content, what did you think you were getting from the creator of Nip/Tuck??, Saved by the Bell??",1304121600,,319,4.517241379310345

4331815,4,B004D9FLJY,"For the person who said that you already have this if you have the Season 1 DVD, the ""Glee Jukebox"" was only on the later disks, the ones released for the 2nd half of the season.  The first disks, up through Sectionals, don't have this option so we're buying this disk to get those performances.  Besides, the ""Glee Jukebox"" option only covered the songs on that particular disk.  This has all of the performances on 1 disk (as far as I know) so we can watch them all without changing disks.

We like the music and performances a lot more than we like the rest of the show with some of its themes so we'll be glad to have this DVD.  I just wish that they'd included the ""Pink Houses"" song by Kurt which you can only see on the Season 1 DVD.

I just changed my review from 5 stars to 4 stars.  The songs & performances included here are fine but I just went back and realized how many performances aren't on here.  This DVD includes 34 songs so there are a lot of songs, some of which we really like, which weren't included here.  18 of the songs are from the first half of the season, which didn't have the ""Glee Jukebox"" option.  Too bad more of them weren't from the first half of the season and then this DVD could be used with the disks from the second half of the season to have a jukebox of a wider range of songs.",1302652800,32,1320,4.12109375
4331816,5,B004D9FLJY,"Last night I watched Glee Encore soon to be released on DVD with my kids. This is the first time they have been allowed to watch Glee and the reason is, Glee is a very good show, with a very adult storyline. Sure it is about a high school and on at the 8:00 hour but folks, that doesn't mean your children should be watching it. The Glee club singing is the safest part of this show yet millions of people allow their children to watch it.

My kids have heard of it, they see the DVD's I own and sing to the Glee Karoake Wii game but will not be allowed to watch the show until they are at least 18. I love the show but don't find it appropriate for kids.

When I asked them to put the Glee DVD in they were shocked. Had mommy lost her mind, did she change her mind, can we really watch Glee? They did get to watch it and it was fun, dancing, singing along to 30 hit songs from the show. They now know the characters, learned some songs they didn't know and I can safely allow them to watch this DVD knowing that the adult theme of the show is not included! They can watch this with my blessing. In fact when they get home, I will ask again if they want to watch because I can't get some of the songs out of my head, especially, Puck singing Beth and Sue singing Vogue.

You and your kids will love this.",1302220800,4,1304,3.969465648854962

8425023,4,B004D9FLJY,"The best thing about Glee was the musical numbers and the beautiful heartwarming character moments.  The heartwarming character moments reminded me of my favorite soap opera Guiding Light during the Pam Long era ( when she was the head writer).

Unfortunately, I wasn't a fan of the style of humor of the show.  I just didn't find it funny.  Oddly, there was an episode of Guiding Light from around February 1989 (the Pam Long era) that had Ryan Murphy's style of humor in it.  It wasn't like Pam Long's normal style of humor in the show.  The episode featured the character of Alexandra Spaulding.

I've always wanted to see a musical TV show or movie where the story for the show or movie was as good as the music.  So far, only Evita and Buffy's musical episode have sort of accomplished that.  There were brief moments of beautiful character scenes in Glee that semi-accomplished that wish.

Regardless, the music covers that Glee did were frequently great.  This DVD features some of best performances from season 1.",1504396800,,1021,4.744318181818182
