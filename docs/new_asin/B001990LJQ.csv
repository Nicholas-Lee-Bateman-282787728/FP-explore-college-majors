3425441,4,B001990LJQ,"Disney seems to hold onto TV series and movies, not realizing that there are fans that do want to own their favorite shows. At last, season 1 of Kim Possible is available, so maybe this signals the beginning of other TV series releases from Disney. It includes all 21 episodes. Prior to this set, the closest you could get to the full season was to buy the episodes from iTunes, but you still needed to buy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Secret-Files/dp/B00008XRVA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""The Secret Files""</a>&nbsp;in order to get the pilot episode ""Crush"" and you wouldn't have ""October 31st"", which is not available in any other commercial release.

The discs include just the episodes and Closed Captioning. No bonus features or commentaries. A little plain for a season set, but it's a step towards the season releases that viewers have come to expect of all TV shows.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Season-2/dp/B004AWMUQ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Season 2</a>&nbsp;is also available.

3425443,5,B001990LJQ,I just got in the latest ad from the Disney Movie Club and on the cover is a bunch of pics of DVD's and Blu-Rays. Among them is the Complete First Season of Kim Possible. Wish I could actually find this as I want to own this one and not recorded eps I got off of Tivo.,1288224000,,268,3.719298245614035
3425444,5,B001990LJQ,"My children loved this show.  They still try to watch it whenever they hear an episode may be coming on.  It is insane for Disney to not release all four seasons.  Even though my children are older now, they would still insist we get the entire series.  I would like that as well.  It was actually quite entertaining for adults as well.  It was pretty funny.

Go ahead Disney and release it while there are enough children around who remember what a great show it is!",1272499200,5,467,4.3604651162790695
3425445,5,B001990LJQ,"Most buyers of this product should already be familiar with the show, Kim Possible - so I'll focus on the boxset itself.

If this is anything like the 3-disc German KP boxset, then the pros include:

+ Great card case, not just a regular plastic case.
+ Brilliant animated menus!
+ 8 Episodes per disc, with excellent clarity.

Cons of the boxset:
- Episodes are not in Widescreen.
- Bonus Features are recycled from past KP DVDs.

However, I was only after the episodes anyway - so I'm still giving the Boxset a 5/5. The brilliant packaging and menu graphics showed me that a lot of effort had gone into producing this Boxset, and it easily blows all the other KP DVDs out of the water! I sincerely hope that Seasons 2, 3 and 4 are released soon. Disney DVD would be mad not to!",1212537600,25,779,4.3517241379310345

3425467,4,B001990LJQ,"Easily the best kids' show of the early 2000s. Not quite on par with the serious dramas like Gargoyles, Exo Squad, Batman Beyond, or Transformers Prime, and not quite the comic brilliance of Invader Zim, it's still original, funny, action-packed, and often surprising, with a wide range of great characters played by some A-list vocal talent including Patrick Warburton. The opening music is pretty catchy, too. Overall, Kim Possible was a bright spot in the cultural wasteland that kids' TV has become.",1428796800,2,503,5.146341463414634

3425470,4,B001990LJQ,"I love this series & would buy the DVD sets in a heartbeat, but OH MY GOD, THE PRICE?????????  Surely the Mouse Company can take a break from hyping ""Frozen"" up the wazoo to maybe re-release some of their older stuff so as to keep the prices to a more-reasonable level!

That's really the only reason I took off one star:  The godawful price which makes purchasing it out of the question.",1420329600,6,388,4.361111111111111
3425471,5,B001990LJQ,We love KP cartoons. They are fun for the whole family. The shows are funny and witty. You even like the villan characters.,1419292800,,123,4.391304347826087

3425473,5,B001990LJQ,I'd forgotten just how much I enjoyed the show. This three-disc set (worth the price) had me laughing out loud several times. I have loved animated movies and tv series for 50+ years. This series will hold up for children  and we children-at-heart for years to come.,1412121600,,266,4.659574468085107

3425497,4,B001990LJQ,I'm a big KP fan.  Most likely one of the oldest 'kids' to watch.  It's a must for any KP fan.  Now only if Disney had put them in their proper order.,1384992000,2,150,3.625
3425498,5,B001990LJQ,My siblings and I used to watch the Kim Possible seasons when we were younger. When it went of the air and there was no longer reruns we didn't even bother to look online for them. It was a great surprise to come across this on Amazon and purchase it for a Christmas gift. It's at a very reasonable price and brought much enjoyment!,1384128000,,332,4.203125
3425499,5,B001990LJQ,I love the first season of kim possible it had all the episode on. I just love when kim possible make the puppy dog pout on some of the episode. It two more season Disney need to put on DVD of kim possible.,1370736000,2,206,3.813953488372093

3425501,5,B001990LJQ,"An awesome beginning to a great show that eventually leads into a larger storyline that's entertaining no matter your age group. Be warned however, that so far this is only a partial season. Hopefully Disney will get the rest on DVD before too long (although Season 2 is still available on DVD).",1364515200,,295,4.6923076923076925
3425502,5,B001990LJQ,"One of the better Disney cartoons for older 'kids'.  The characters are often well developed, and stories are good.  The rat character was a big mistake though.  If you can get past that, okay.  Like typical Disney, the villains are well done.",1359849600,,243,4.714285714285714
3425503,5,B001990LJQ,I didn't have any problems. This was a gift for my daughter in college. She got it quickly and loved it.,1349395200,,104,4.0
3425514,1,B001990LJQ,"I've loved this show since it first aired, and was SO excited to see it is FINALLY on DVD! But the price is an insult! Seriously? A lackluster release with no widescreen for this price? I'm disgusted. Disney pulled similar shenanigans with the DuckTales Movie DVD release. I had to import a region 2 version to get it for a reasonable price. I don't understand why some of Disney's best material gets this kind of shoddy, bait and switch type treatment. Way to price gouge Disney! I'll be waiting for something better. P.S. for the review that said this and season 2 of Kim Possible are available on Disney movie club--not seeing them as of the date of this review. Perhaps Disney pulled them after realizing what a big mistake this release was? Let's hope...",1349222400,10,759,4.62962962962963
3425515,5,B001990LJQ,This show was very good and very funny but current sellers are asking way to much for the first season with only 21 episodes. It was $35.00 just a week ago but then went up to $50.00 (a bit much for a cartoon series). I will wait until prices come back down or Disney wises up and releases the complete series for a decent price!,1339027200,3,329,4.076923076923077

3425519,5,B001990LJQ,"...if only!  Kim is among the best role-models any tween-age girl can find.  Granted she has a ""running start"" as the daughter of a ""Rocket Scientist"" and a ""Brain Surgeon"" but having the tools, and CHOOSING to use them are VERY different things.

Kim is the opposite of the ""disengaged"" and ""disinterested"" kids we see hanging out in the malls and ""Centers"" of our cities and towns, She's involved; she's an active participant in her own life, and the larger world.  Maybe watching this show won't make your kid ""save the world"" but it MIGHT get them off the Couch and into SOMETHING.

Her career started out as a simple ""Babysitting/Dogwalking for Hire"" way of raising some money, however it rapidly got ""out of hand"" and she rose to the challenges winding up getting involved in things she'd never have imagined.  Life can be like that, sometimes.  The question is how you respond to it.  She grabbed the tiger by the ears and learned to not just ride it, but steer it!",1328313600,3,972,4.6104651162790695
3425520,5,B001990LJQ,"First let me say Disney should have allowed the series to die on it's own.  I cannot say what a shot in the arm this series was to the esteem of young girls, my little niece just loves the character.  Question, where are the other two seasons,  seasons 3, and 4?  I gifted seasons 1, and 2 to my niece last year, but I have not been able to find the last two seasons.

As an animated series goes this was history making, if I recall correctly, this series nearly won an Emmy for best animated series, and as I sat and watched the series with my niece and her little posse, Uncle baby sitter whatched the glee on their little faces with Kim's each victory.  They were saddened when they got the news Disney was killing the series.  My hope is that Disney will at least make some Kim Possible movies, for the next generation.",1320192000,2,823,4.237179487179487
3425521,3,B001990LJQ,"I love this show.  I've been waiting a long time for this show to come out DVD, but unfortunately, it is not presented in the widescreen format that it should be made in.  I like to see all the action.  Hopefully it will be released in a widescreen version soon so I can enjoy it as it was meant to be seen.",1318464000,4,307,3.9193548387096775

The price is still a bit steeper than I was hoping for, but now that I know they're out there, you can bet I'll be watching out for them to go down a bit more :) This show is an example of the Disney Channel at its finest for sure.",1306108800,,268,3.559322033898305
3425523,5,B001990LJQ,"It has been a long time in waiting for the Kim Possible series to come out. Now that it's here it hoped that more Disney TV series will come out, such as, 'The Buzz on Maggie', 'Fillmore'& 'The Replacements'. However I digress, This is the only season 1 Kim Possible series available and it's a good one.

Story: Kim possible is a teenager cheerleader who saves the world from Bad guys & girls, with her friend Ron Stoppable and his pet mole rat, Rufus. They travel the world with the help of Wade, computer genius.

DVD: This set has no extras. 4:3 aspect or 1.33:1. Dolby Digital 2.0 stereo. 21 episodes at 22mins each.

Overview: This is a good series for those who like action, but not over the top. No course language and great humour. Not to mention well drawn.

P.S. Season 2 available as well(just as good) waiting for seasons 3 & 4",1304467200,3,840,4.4
8272603,5,B001990LJQ,"Bought this for a Christmas gift for a female friend (aged 23). She squeeled with delight when she opened it up. She didn't think that the full seasons were available. Not quite my own cup of tea in the animation category, but seems to be remembered fondly by many.",1520467200,,265,4.428571428571429

8272606,5,B001990LJQ,"Surprisingly good quality for DVD (still hoping for a future Blu-Ray release though). The box comes with three mini-dvd plastic packets. So there's a total of 3 DVDs that house a total of 21 episodes here. Worth it for collectors, the quality of the video is surprisingly good considering I'm watching it on a desktop with 4k resolution (so it scales nicely).",1517529600,,359,4.806451612903226

8272611,5,B001990LJQ,Disney needs to stop disrespecting its fans and give us what we want and thats releases of all the great shows that we love and hopefully they realize that and we can start getting seasons of shows not those random 3 to 5 episode volumes that never complete the series....,1456358400,,272,4.46
8272612,5,B001990LJQ,Kim Possible is possibly one of the best cations created ever!!  Why is it not available hardly anywhere. Is Disney keeping it in the vault for a reason? The price for each season is my only complaint.,1454976000,2,201,4.4324324324324325
