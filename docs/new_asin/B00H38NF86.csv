8629399,5,B00H38NF86,"This is really well done!  The Garden Island is so romantic and beautiful... It's so nice to scope it out before going there, so that I won't be missing anything!  They cover the beaches, trails, and restaurants really well.  It's just like being there already and will be nice to bring up memories after visiting there!

8629401,3,B00H38NF86,"This video gives a fairly good look at the towns and vistas of Kauai, but misses the 'spirit' and ancient culture that can still be felt here.  Living here on the beautiful Garden Isle, the video fell a bit flat for me and I turned it off.  It was more of a promotional tourist thing.  So it would be worth exploring if other videos are available, unless you're interested in just where to go and what to do, like any tourist brochure offers, and there are lots of those as you arrive at Lihue airport.",1426377600,,502,4.2631578947368425

8629403,5,B00H38NF86,"Incredible DVD of ""The Garden Island"".  A few  naysayers view Kauai as too laid back, relaxed  compared to Oahu and Maui.  I disagree since to me this island comes the closest to what Hawaii was  back in 1959 when it became a state.  This presentation hosted by upbeat narrator Lanae Anakalea covers plenty of territory going over one hour and a half in length.  It's all here from the picturesque resorts, towns, beaches, canyons, rivers, water falls  and wonders not found anywhere else in the world.  Top notch film quality, too.  It also is a very good measuring stick to see whether Kauai is worth travelling to on a  future vacation.  Kauai is the wrong destination for people looking for tall skyscrapers, large mega-malls and over crowded marinas.  ""The Garden Island"" is all about a true escape to a modern day paradise.",1420588800,2,829,4.753521126760563
