1722940,5,B0000682UD,"As you watch this collection of DVD's you will see Baz Luhrmans style develop into a well-formed art.  As he hones his talent into a unique craft, Baz has made himself a name in the world of filmmaking with these three flicks.  All of the stories revolve around intense love stories filled with glamour, great music, tons of glitz, and avant garde cinematography.  While all of the stories have familiar echos to other famous films, they are all completely unique in setting and feeling.
""Strictly Ballroom"" is probably the lesser known of the 3 movies in this set, and is a typical underdog dance story, where the main character Scott Hastings is snubbed by a Ballroom dance society for his unique moves.  He hooks up with a newbie to the scene and passion arises as they try to work together to win a big dance competition despite what people think of them.  The storyline is somewhat similar to ""Girls Just Wanna Have Fun"" but I must say, this is the best movie about Ballroom Dancing ever made...quite possibly the only one mind you.
Next we have the Shakespeare remake of his classic play 'Romeo and Juliet' that tells the tale of two lovers that cross paths but everything in their lives is trying to pull them apart.  This movie is filmed in a different standard then strictly ballroom, with a lot more avant garde shots and mixing of scenes.  Leonardo Dicaprio and Claire Danes lack chemistry, but while Leo really works as the Romeo, Claires preformance is lackluster at times and almost downright funny in the final scene.  You have to give Luhrman the upmost props for adapting this story in a way that doesn't make you question the loop holes, including having a newscaster tell the nararration, having sloppy fed-ex message delivery men, and fights with guns instead of swords.
Finally we have the finale of Baz's trio of flicks, a more-musical based little ;) movie titled ""Moulin Rouge"" that takes you to turn of the century Paris.  The story is filled with schmultz and love, but that only adds to it.  It follows two young lovers (again), one of them a prostitute who must stay loyal to her job at hte Moulin Rouge, the other a young writer with his head in the clouds who bewitches the Courtsean du jour, Satine, and of course, chaos ensues over their tryst.  This film is done extremely well, with lots of beautiful effects and over-the-top imagery that exudes love and an old-time movie feel.  Definately my fave of the three, this one tugs at my heart strings every time I watch it.
Don't forget the great special features with this, that take you behind the red curtain for each movie by gettin to know the cast, the concepts, and the crew.  Baz does a great job exploring some cool art forms in each movie: Dancing, Drama, and Music.  Excellent!",1060214400,7,2768,4.645491803278689
1722941,2,B0000682UD,"I have to say that Baz Luhrmann is an artist. It would be blasphemous to say that he is not. What can I say? The man KNOWS his art....But from a visual perspective only. I'll try and show you what I mean by tackling these films one by one.
First on the list: Strictly Ballroom. This is the ONE film of Luhrumann's trilogy that actually deserves a good DVD. It's been a favorite of my family's since before I can remember. The costumes are great, the characters are wonderfully eccentric, and the music...Did I mention the music? Anyway, it's a good film. If you get anything out of this review, it's that ""Ballroom"" alone would be a better buy than one good film and two disasters.
Next: Romeo + Juliet. Ahhh. Where to start? It has a promising first thirty seconds. Some of Luhrmann's innovations on this update of Shakespeare's immortal play are pretty cool. Narrations come from a TV newswoman. The nurse is a hispanic maid. The Prince is a police captain. However, the cinematography gets cluttered (foreshadowing for the dizzying complications in ""Moulin Rouge""). Mercutio is portrayed as a drag queen, which, personally, was kinda hard to take. However, there is one good part in all of this. One of the final scenes in Juliet's family crypt (where the two doomed lovers commit suicide) is almost better than when Shakespeare originally wrote it. Anyway, now that that's done, let's go on to the final film in the Red Curtain Trilogy.
Finally, we come to the film that is supposed to be Luhrmann's opus: Moulin Rouge. I have mixed feelings on this film. While some of the parts were actually quite good (they were all in the second half), we get even more of the cluttered, crazy cinematography we saw in ""Romeo"". Only now it's in almost every other scene. This, makes the film seem surreal, which, I'm guessing, is the point. However, it's hard for a lot of the viewers to really get to know the characters involved. We see them only as characters in a dream. The development is little. Much of the plot is almost silly, and the villain is hardly more than a spoiled child of privilege. It's hard to see him as a villain as opposed to a small child who needs a good spanking.
So, there you have it. Luhrmann's ""Red Curtain Trilogy"" in a nutshell. So, again, if you really want to own a Luhrmann film, I tell you to save your money and just go and buy ""Strictly Ballroom"". That, at least, is worth its price.",1055635200,3,2414,4.551724137931035
1722942,5,B0000682UD,"I can't truly compare this box set to other box sets since I don't own any others, but The Red Curtain Trilogy is truly a set to be reckoned with.  Baz Luhrmann seems to put as much care into his DVD's as he does the movies themselves.  In fact, only the Lord of the Rings Extended version can boast more features (probably).  Most people have probably formed their own opinions of the movies in the set, but I will add my two cents about them.
I suppose my main reason for buying the set was Strictly Ballroom; I love this movie.  It is admittedly completely over the top and melodramatic, and no one else has made such great use of melodrama as Luhrmann.  The features on this disk are probably thinnest of any of the movies, but there is still plenty with which you may play.  The only thing its missing is footage from the original stage production, which I would dearly love to see... but Baz Luhrmann heard my cry... i am getting ahead of myself.  Independently, Strictly Ballroom would probably get 5 of 5 stars.

The next movie in the trilogy is Romeo + Juliet.  I took a long time to watch this movie and waited until it was on television.  I didn't hate the movie, so I was willing to buy the RCT, and I hadn't given R+J any other thought until I bought the trilogy.  Its a lot better than I remember.  Though there were elements worse than I remembered.  Some people judge it pretty harshly for stupid reasons like cutting lines.  Few theatres actually perform Shakespeare in its entirety anymore, and Luhrmann has made great economy with the language.  The best example is Juliet's monologue after Romeo dies; it is rendered unnecessary by the staging and cuts.  My big beef with this film is that the actors don't handle the language as well in some places.  Luhrmann describes R+J as violent and sexy, and the actors seem to only give credence to the parts of the film that are violent and sexy.  In those areas of the film, the actors shine and truly attack the words and Shakespeare is fresh and wonderful, but in the rest of the movie, the actors may as well be speaking gibberish for all of the sense they make of what they say.  The extras on this disc are fantastic, there's lots of behind the scenes footage, design concepts and the general fare that consumers come to expect from their DVDs, especially if they are from Baz Luhrmann films.  Independently, I would give this four of five stars.

The film that probably is the highlight for many in this trilogy, is Moulin Rouge.  There is very little to say and you can read the many reviews that customers have written for it.  Basically, if you can get past the initial 20 minutes, then you are in for a fantastic movie.  El Tango de Roxanne actually took my breath away and is reason enough to see the film.  This DVD sets the bar for extra features (well the bar has since been raised, but this is still one of the best DVDs out there).  The second DVD is packed (packed I say!)with extra footage.  And there are lots of fun easter eggs hidden on the discs to be sought out, including one blooper reel of  ""Your Song.""  MR definitely would get 5 out of 5 stars.

Lastly, we come to the Behind the Red Curtain disc.  This disc truly rounds out the collection and is packed with information.  The Behind the Red Curtain feature is truly fun, like a Choose Your Own Adventure book (though not quite), wherein Baz talks about the creation of the three movies, and little things pop up on the screen for you to choose, and they lead you from Baz's lecture to special footage, including some footage of the original stage version of Strictly Ballroom when it was performed at a festival.  There's also footage of his production of La Boheme with the Australian Opera and other sundry bits of archival footage.  The disc is truly a fantastic disc of extra features that makes this set worth purchasing.

Overall, I have enjoyed the Red Curtain Trilogy, and I highly suggest it.  If you were still wondering whether or not you should purchase it, I would like to assure you that it is truly worth the money.  In the final analysis, the box set is definitely worth 5 out of 5 stars.",1054339200,3,4148,4.44635761589404
1722943,5,B0000682UD,"I don't own this DVD, but I have seen all three movies, and I have to say that Baz is my alltime favorite director. Sure, his movies are little weird at times, but he captures such great things from his actors. Some of these actors best performances are in his movies. Not to mention, he does the most EXQUISITE death scenes. The emotions he pulls from these people are just incredible.",1034899200,3,386,4.450704225352113
1722944,5,B0000682UD,"Baz's ideas are imaginative and incredibly artistic. Loved all the movies. Moulin Rouge is the Best!

1722945,2,B0000682UD,"So I'm writing this not based on the fact that it's a boxed set of these three movies, but based on the fact that any one of them is not so impressive. I don't like Baz's direction because, in very short, it doesn't allow for the viewer to have an attention span - it felt like a continual climax and it tired me. (This is for all three of them, by the way.) Any one of them entertained me for about 40% of the time. That's 2 out of every 5 minutes for each movie. Therefore, it deserves 2 out of 5 stars.",1031961600,4,505,3.912621359223301

1722978,5,B0000682UD,"Ended up getting Strictly Ballroom for free if purchased seperately. Turns out I love that movie as well. Baz Luhrmann's amazing capability of turning classic stories and transliterate them into todays ""fast-pace"" society is quite a feat. The soundtracks are excellent and the ""making of"" is giving you some insight about his farm.",1364256000,,331,5.264150943396227
1722979,5,B0000682UD,"If you are the artistic and/or musical type with a sensibility that enjoys artistry in filmmaking then GET THIS. They are remarkably still entertaining to those who don't fall into that category though. These are all three beautiful films but very different. Romeo+Juliet is the most story heavy (obviously), Strictly ballroom has a funny mocumentary feel that is half story, half dancing, and Moulin Rouge is the most singing/dancing heavy with less story--but still a great one at that!

These are three of my favorite movies and all together they are a wow. I would think a great holiday gift too.",1290816000,,600,4.9405940594059405
1722980,5,B0000682UD,"Either you love Baz Luhrmann or you hate him.  I love him--the color, the dancing, the whole singing, blooming, fuzzy overdoneness of his musicals, and, yes, I'm a sucker for love, too. It's not because I'm a woman.  My husband loves Luhrmann and loves it that people fall in love, albeit tragically in Romeo and Julet and Moulin Rouge.  This is a great collection.  Strictly Ballroom is a premier feel-good movie, but it's also a brilliant take on the Hollywood musicals of the 50's.  Romeo & Juliet is a bold reconstruction of how Shakespeare wrote his plays: full of hyperbole, often to the point of bombast.  Shakespeare used the popular songs of his day and also had a lot of violence in his plays.  He wasn't writing for college professors, but to the ordinary people of his time.  Shakespeare wasn't highbrow in the 16th century, and Luhrmann doesn't make his R&J highbrow.  Moulin Rouge is over the top, but, as I said, either you like it or you don't",1286841600,,959,4.627218934911243

1722982,5,B0000682UD,"I really like how Baz Luhrmann's style of moviemaking is so unique.  These are very lively movies, with great use of music and color throughout!  Moulin Rouge is definitely one of my favorite movies of all time, with such creative use of many pop songs we have all known for years.  The ""Tango di Roxanne"" has got to be one of the greatest movie sequences ever!  Talk about using a song in an entirely new way.  I have to say that Elton John's ""Your Song"" has always been my favorite song, and after this movie I had a new version in my head that is equal to the original, but yet so wonderfully different.  Moulin Rouge is awesome!",1235174400,,632,4.313559322033898

1723023,5,B0000682UD,"I love all 3 films and Baz Lurhman for making them.

The 1st film Strictly Ballroom is about a wallflower in love with an energetic young male dancer from a ballroom dancing obsessed family. Scott Hastings is set to become ballroom dancing's next star, but his partner Liz, leaves him for a hilariously drunk idiot puppet dancer. Enter Fran, the wallflower student in his mother's studio and the daughter of immigrants. The immigrants are fabulous Latin dancers seeing as Fran's father is a legendary flamenco dancer, her Grandmother is too and the Paso Doble is never the same when you see it in this movie. The lesson of the movie is never let fear keep you from your dreams even against tremendous odds. The subject of the movie is also dance and you see it at its visual best with cinematic glitz

The 2nd film is a modern homage to Shakespeare with the tale of Romeo and Juliet portrayed in a modern setting, but with the immortal words of Shakespeare. Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Daines are the perfect actors to play the doomed lovers; I also loved John Leguizamo as the smart Mercutio. The visual power of the film combined with the words is indeed appealing to the current generation's preference for visual media.

The 3rd film combines dance, words, and music to culminate in a cinematic masterpiece to the senses that seduces the viewer into the story. The doomed romance of Christian and Satine is made more poignant by the sharp use of color and the witty use of modern musical pop tunes. I will never forget the rendition of Like A Virgin.

I recommend everyone to have these 3 films in their movie collection.",1163203200,2,1626,4.674825174825175
1723024,4,B0000682UD,"Moulin Rouge is my boyfriend and my most favorite movie ever. We never expected to like, not one bit. But after we rented it, then bought it -- well, we've watched it dozens and dozens of times and even gone to a Sing-a-Long night here in DC, which was great fun. Romance, conflict, pop songs and a whole lot of foretelling lead up to the most fulfilling climax and an ever-so-sad ending. ""Quick, play it again!""

Romeo & Juliet is cool enough. The best part of the whole thing is when they die at the end. (I don't think I'm giving anything away with that famous plot twist.) Honestly, I wasn't familiar with the plot or dialogue so I was lost the first time I watched it. Then I rewatched it with the English subtitles -- big help! Thank gawd for DVDs.

Strictly Ballroom is the weakest of the three and the only one I originally saw in the theatre. It's a modest cinderella-type story mostly told from the prince-like dancer who plays the lead. The side characters are rather cartoonish and other than the lead, no one is as beautiful as this storyline needs them to be. It's okay.

I was most excited to finally buy this triple pack for my boyfriend's birthday a few months ago -- I really wanted to see what the 4th Disc had. I liked the workshop documentary and loved the remix of ""Someday I'll Fly Away."" There's some nice stuff here... but A LOT is missing, too: NONE of the DVD-ROM links work anymore! I have no idea what tidbits I'm missing, but I feel a bit ripped off [sigh]. What's left is some bits of the background music from the movie. The best song is under the ""Toulouse Tonight"" section, ""Meet you in the Red Room"" I think is what it's called. But the screenplay and web vignettes are all gone. Come on FOX, get it back online or give me a partial refund! It hasn't been that long since this set came out.",1104969600,4,1825,4.330409356725146
1723025,4,B0000682UD,"Baz Luhrmann's ""Strictly Ballroom"", ""Romeo and Juliet"" with Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio, and ""Moulin Rouge"" with Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman, are included in this set.  Luhrmann's unique directorial style is delightfully showcased in these films and it is intersting to note his progression in developing his craft through the films.
I gave it a 4 because ""Strictly Ballroom"" isn't as good as the latter two films, although still worth a watch or two.",1104796800,,462,5.16
1723026,4,B0000682UD,"The colorful, whirling world of Baz Luhrmann is brought to life in the Red Curtain Trilogy, comprising ""Strictly Ballroom,"" ""Romeo + Juliet,"" and ""Moulin Rouge."" While there are sticky patches -- particularly the pairing of Danes and DiCaprio in ""Romeo + Juliet"" --the overall effect is beautiful and poignant.

 ""Strictly Ballroom"" is the problem in Scott's (Paul Mercurio) life. He's an outstanding dancer, but he refuses to conform to the Australian ballroom rules -- he wants to dance his own steps. When he loses his partner, awkward Fran (Tara Morice) enters the scene and asks to dance with him. These two outcasts of the ballroom start to fall in love as they try to win a major competition.

 ""Romeo + Juliet"" gives a modern Californian twist to the classic tale of feuding families and starcrossed young lovers. Romeo (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Juliet (Claire Danes) come from a pair of families locked in a deadly feud, but they fall in love anyway. Their desperate efforts to be together lead to tragedy...

 ""Moulin Rouge"" gives us another kind of bittersweet love story -- a musical rather than a revamped classic. Bohemian poet Christian (Ewan McGregor) dips into the sensuous, flashy world of Moulin Rouge. There he falls in love with the beautiful, sickly Satine (Nicole Kidman), a star at the club, and a well-known courtesan. Unfortunately, their growing love is threatened by a duke, who wants Satine all for himself.

 As a boy, Baz Luhrmann grew up around ballroom competitions, which give the heart to these movies. But the soul is in the presentation. It's theatrical, colorful, dazzling to the eyes and centered on classic tales of doomed love and succeeding against the odds.

 Luhrmann's sense of the theatrical is included in his direction -- it can be very sharp and fast, and sometimes downright crazy. With another director, it might seem flashy and gaudy, but Luhrmann's unique style works. A particular risk is making a musical, something which spelled death for movies for a long time... until Luhrmann revived it with Moulin Rouge. Or the postmodern tale of Romeo and Juliet, which is imperfect, but still quite pleasant.

 The acting tends to be excellent, although the acting in ""Romeo + Juliet"" is spotty, and DiCaprio and Danes have zero chemistry. But McGregor and Kidman in particular are outstanding, and Tara Morice and Paul Mercurio of ""Strictly Ballroom"" have electricity and sweetness to spare. The supporting actors are quite good as well.

 And the three-DVD set is graced with plenty of extras -- documentaries, commentary on each film, behind-the-scenes peeks, featurettes, and some gorgeous music videos. And there's even an extra disc included with a ""Red Curtain"" documentary about Luhrmann's style, scripts, screensavers, more music videos, and more.

 Baz Luhrmann reinvented the musical and gave his movies a lush, strange look that entices viewers even now. Sensuous, fun and funky, this is a trilogy to definitely check out.",1091145600,20,2979,5.098765432098766
1723027,5,B0000682UD,"This is an awesome DVD set. It has two of my favorite movies, Moulin Rouge and Strictly Ballroom.

Moulin Rouge
I had no desire to watch this movie as I do not enjoy musicals. I usually get embarrassed for the characters who break into song, but with this movie I was amazed. The acting of Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor (what a hottie!) was superb. I was amazed a what good voices they had. I was mesmerized from the very beginning. The songs are just beautiful.
Listening to Ewan McGregor's woefull voice tell the tale of his beloved Satine was heartbreaking. I was sucked into the vortex of Moulin Rouge. I cannot understand how anyone who watched this movie did not fall in love with it and the characters. Granted the main character is a courtesan, but who cares? She falls in love with the penniless writer and true love prevails, she understands what 'true love'is. From the very beginning we know that their love was doomed, but we still rooted for them, for love is 'like oxygen' and we wanted them to be happy.
All in all, this was an amazing movie. I would suggest that you watch it before believing the hype. Amazing movie, I loved it!!
Strictly Ballroom
I must admit, it took me approximately 20 minutes to actually get into this movie. I so wanted to shut if off, but I gave it the benefit of the doubt and decided to give it more time. I am extremely happy that I did.
While this is not a 'masterpiece' as 'Moulin Rouge', it is definately VERY good. The acting was stupendous. The actors made me feel that the story was very real. In a very 'slight' way, I was reminicant of 'Dirty Dancing'.
Scott is this Awesome ballroom dancer who does not adhere to 'Strictly Ballroom' rules. He loses a major competition due to his unorthodox dance moves. His overly dramatic dance partner dumps him right before another major competition, and poor Scott is left partnerless. In appears an extremely 'ugly duckling' who wants to dance with him. What happens next is ..... well, I guess you should watch it to know the rest.
Overall this was a delightfully lighthearted movie with some poignant scenes that will leave you teary eyed. I recommend it wholeheartedly.
Romeo & Juliet
This was a very good movie. Most everyone knows the story of Romeo and Juliet and this is a good adaption with a funky twist. This was not one of my favorite movies in the set, but as stories go, this was very unique.
Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio were outstanding as the star crossed lovers in this newly updated tale of love and woe. They are both fairly young and that makes the story all the more heartbreaking. If you are looking for an old classic with an unusual twist, then this movie is for you.
All in all, this 4 DVD set is Awesome. There is a 4th DVD with special inside information and unique interviews. If you like these movies than this is a must buy. I recommend it greatly.",1076457600,13,2879,4.494274809160306

This is however a great movie, the acting, and directing are above most. Then is the powerful, Romeo + Juliet. This is a most visual movie. The best use, of color, lighting, and camera angles, I've seen in a long time. The story is nothing new, two lovers, torn apart by family disputes. but Baz has taken the story and has made it his own, with the use of such bold imagery, and a mix of mordern, with the old. (...) Lastly is the movie Moulin Rouge. WOW! Baz has done it again, this is an other visual mastery. The story is yet another love story, but again Baz has created something which is impossible to look away from. In the end this is a collection that is a must have, so ge it, watch it, and enjoy.",1075161600,,873,4.233532934131737
1723029,5,B0000682UD,"Too bad the stale, lame idiots in New York don't get it.
Baz uses his talent to connect the masses to the stage with his unique ""red curtain"" style of creating a story. This is better than broadway.
Actually... SCREW broadway! Just use your money for this stuff, it's much better anyway. The music is the best of the best in our culture; and so are the actors, two things Broadway can't get right, well, sometimes it does such as in the case of Sheri Scott, or Elton John. But, I digress. Back to Baz.
Record companies are struggling to inject some life into theatre and to recreate the successful era that Jesus Christ Superstar and Hair brought to popular radio, and let's face it, they can't. Why? They aren't hiring the right talent that's why. They keep hiring people that can't tell the difference between ""popular"" music and ""Sorta popular"" music. Hence the failure of the marriage of the two, short of some forced, manipulated appearances by popular artists singing lifeless stage tunes that need to simply go away. The artists look so manipulated by the powers that be it's sickening. If the producers can't tell how manipulated the artist looks, how are they going to tell much about the audience or art for that matter?
Again, I digress.
But, here in this triology Baz takes the best of the best. Simple formula hey? Then why don't more use it? Lack of brains perhaps??
In Romeo and Juliet he uses the best literature in the English language to tell the story. In Strictly Ballroom he uses dance to tell the story. In Moulin Rouge he uses song to tell the story and it's actually likeable and fun to watch, even the stale Broadway tunes he incorporates, it's simply fun and good.
Study Baz, learn from him, follow his stuff, you won't regret it. He is a legend. A trailblazer, and thank goodness someone has risen to the occassion in the land of the drones that even narcaleptics have nightmares over.",1062288000,4,1912,4.609970674486804

7963898,2,B0000682UD,"I bought this set primarily for Strictly Ballroom. I also enjoyed Moulin Rouge, so this boxset, on sale at the time, seemed like a good deal. So, when I got the boxset (the box itself is kind of poor quality, but I didn't care much knowing that this isn't a collector's item), I tried watching Strictly Ballroom right away. The Strictly Ballroom dvd cover was plain silver with text which seemed odd for a DVD edition of a much loved (albeit early 90's) movie. But, I was midway through playing it on my computer, and the audio began skipping beats during the most beloved scenes (""Perhaps, Perhaps"") and completely ruined the experience so much that I stopped right then and there. I tried stopping and then restarting the movie, but the skipping still occurred. The audio itself also sounded of poor quality; the transitions between music and speech sounded awkward, and I swore I heard a line that hadn't occurred in the cut I watched (the DVD had a voiceover from Scott saying something like ""I'm still doing the tryouts"" when the scene cuts from his first time teaching Fran to the tryouts montage - so weird!). Since not every reviewer, including Strictly Ballroom fans, noted this issue, I'm hoping that maybe I just received a poor bootleg copy or a pre-theatrically edited version of Strictly Ballroom and the seller will remedy and send me an official one.

EDIT: I did some more snooping and I found out that other clips of the ""Perhaps"" scene (""HD Movie clips"" on youtube) had that same skip I noticed... I don't know what to think anymore. But the fact that the face of the DVD itself is plain silver without even a graphic makes me think this DVD is suspicious.",1452124800,,1675,4.63973063973064

7963901,3,B0000682UD,"I haven't seen any of Baz Luhrmann's films so I decided to buy his red curtain trilogy for a look. when it arrived I was pretty excited to see it. Though the box was frayed and was partly ripped at the top. It's wrinkly at the top of the back of the box. But my biggest complaint is that when I looked at the movies, Strictly Ballroom was a different copy from the rest of the dvd's. I brushed it off then started thinking about it. So I googled it and it turns out that there was supposed to be another copy to go with it. But everything else is in perfect shape. The art cover is outstanding but I'd recommend finding a place that that has the right copies altogether.",1436227200,,670,4.122137404580153

7963903,4,B0000682UD,"If you like Baz Luhmann's movies and don't already have these three movies separately, this collection nicely ties them together. There are 5 discs altogether here: 1 for Strictly Ballroom (Luhrmann's first feature), 1 for Romeo and Juliet, 2 for Moulin Rouge, and 1 extra disc with commentary about the movies and his creative process.

The red cover itself is a simple cardboard box -- nothing fancy.

Also, keep in mind that these are DVDs, not Blu-Rays.",1397520000,,457,4.922077922077922
