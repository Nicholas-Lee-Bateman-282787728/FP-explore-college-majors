418123,3,6301978641,"One of the true treasures of my childhood, I saw this again as an 38 year old and had much the same feeling.  This is a good one, with a few significant flaws.  First, hopefully, I'm not the only one...but I found the princess MUCH more attractive and (yes) sexy after she was changed into the yellow-eyed, green-skinned evil incarnation.  Maybe it was the tighter dress, but she really did it for me, especially considering the ""nice"" princess was so vapid and bland.
As for the effects, they were also mostly charming.  The harpies attack on the ship to steal the princess was actually frightening!  As for the stop motion effects, by Jim Danforth, they were amatuer at best, crude at worst.  It's no wonder he never stepped out from Harryhausen's shadow.
Still, in all, a good film!",1009497600,6,785,4.6521739130434785
418124,4,6301978641,"If you check my review posted below, you will realize that I am very fond of this flawed but fabulous film.  The GOOD NEWS about the DVD release-----it's the ORIGINAL version, NOT the putrid Musical re-make!
The Less-than-Good news is that the transfer (obviously from a print)isn't as crisp and contrast-y as one would ideally like.  In addition, it's a bit disappointing to realize, assuming this realease is authorized, that MGM/UA is not interested enough in this film to release it on their own, and thus has licensed it to Good Times, a serviceable, but second-rate outfit.
Oh, well---guess I shouldn't complain.  It's just GREAT to have it in the DVD format.
Oh yes,.....the SOUND on the DVD is fabulous--bright, clear, dynamic, crisp.
And, incidentally, I bought and watched Harryhausen's ""7th Voyage of Sinbad"" recently.....great, awesome stop-motion work, of course (I remember seeing it in the theatre in early '59----I was literally shaking with excitement and terror simultaneously!  Had to go out to the lobby to regain my composure as they were climbing through the hills of Colossa looking for the Roc's egg!  Subsequently had cool dreams of the cyclops chasing me on the beach!....)
BUT----HAVING SAID ALL OF THAT-----I'd still prefer ""JACK"" ANY DAY!  It's so much more human and engaging.  Watch the scene after Jack has killed the first Giant and the King asks him
""Have you seen the Princess""......it's so charming----nice acting, beautiful music (you catch a bit of the doll's music box dance transformed by the orchestra under the dialogue...), then we meet Jack's mother, touchingly played by Helen Wallace...things like this just add so much to the enjoyment of a fantasy film.
And the SET-UPS!!!....despite some of the crude visual quality---the experimental angles and odd shots which they used....shots from above the giant....dropping the rope around his neck...the bucket of flour in his eyes, his falling and nearly crushing Jack...the 2-headed giant about to deliver the ""coup-de-grace"" to the sea serpent with the anchor when Sigurd (in dog form) saves the day by jumping on the giant's back to distract him, while Peter (in chimp form) tosses rocks on the giant, in order to give the serpent time to revive from his beating......the harpy hovering over the ship, swooping, diving,  ascending with the animated Jack on his back, the duo-death-dive into the sea with Jack and the Harpy side-by-side--------NO WONDER the film went so far over budget and took so long....these were incredibly COMPLEX SHOTS being done by a bunch of guys who were practically making it up as they went!!  There is NOTHING this
daring and spectacular in ""Sinbad"";  just lots of straight-on shots, impressive though they may be.
But I do go on.........",1005782400,29,2761,5.115555555555556
418125,4,6301978641,"I remember seeing this movie back in 1962.  I was 8, my little brother 5.
He was so scared by the movie that it gave him nightmares two nights running.
He wasn't the only one.  Stephan Arngrim (Barry Lockridge from the ""Land of the Giants"") said it scared him half to death as well!!

418127,4,6301978641,"MGM/UA/s PREVIOUS release (VHS and Laser Disc) of ""Jack the Giant Killer"" was, in fact,the ORIGINAL NON-MUSICAL version (thank god), even though the box described it as ""Complete with musical songs.."".  If the current version IS the musical, AVOID IT AT ALL COSTS;...it is trash!  However, if it is the original NON-musical version, then buy and enjoy it!
Yes, producer Edward Small deliberately imitated Harryhausens' ""7th Voyage of Sinbad"" (which Small had actually turned down in the mid-50's; when ""Sinbad"" went on to reap huge profits, Small was kicking himself and thus set out to produce his ""own"" version).  Yes, the animation isn't as polished as Harryhausen's......yes, the production values were not as high... But ""Jack"" is still something that Harryhausen films could never be....ENGAGING on a human level...fresh, quick-moving, genuinely enchanting.  The crude animation, in a way, adds to the charm of the film, which manages to capture the essential fantasy, fairy-tale world in a way which Harryhausen's humorless, heavy-handed approach could not.
Kerwin Matthews is, as always, sincere and engaging, Torin Thatcher is more controlled than in ""Sinbad"", Dayton Lummis is a cool King Mark, Barry Kelley is a hoot as Sigurd the Viking.  Don Beddoe...always a fine, understated actor, here performs wonders of subtlety and telling characterization while stuck inside a giant prop bottle.  Even Robert Gist, who portrayed ""Hal"" (Jack Buchanan's side-kick) in ""The Band Waqon"" turns up briefly as the ill-fated ship's captain.  And, of course, my FAVORITE character actor of all time...the underrated, forgotten WAlter Burke plays Garna, Pendragon's henchman, in his usual skilled way (Anyone ever seen him in the episode of ""Ben Casey"" called ""The Men Who Raised Rabbits?""-he's superb).  Only Anna Lee's ""witch"" scene is embarrasingly bad, as is the bulk of Judy Meredith's Princess Elaine (she was Frank Sinatra's main squeeze at the time the principal photography was done (Summer, 1960).
Yes....the music of Paul Sawtell is no match for Herrmann's ""7th Voyage"" score, but it is rousing, tuneful and, in the case of the mechanical doll dance, absolutely enchanting.  The final harpy scene (designed and animated by Jim Danforth) is first-rate, the Wah Chang-designed giants are bizarre and fantastic, the witches, who due to complications during filming were never realized on screen as the designers intended, are still cool in a child-like, imaginative way (a ""Fish"" witch?..a ""Bunny"" witch?...a mini-Godzilla witch with a harp-like mouth that emits a gale-force wind....? ).
And those rockin', swaying' KNights of the Dragon's Teeth, always my favorite sequence and, as director Nathan Juran said, a scene which ""didn't contain one dollar's worth of special effects"" (!)....just stop & start the camera, explode some powder, march in those Knights, and add Sawtell's mechanized music....voila! .....another simple, exciting fantasy sequence that keeps the film bubbling along.
Yeah, I know it ain't Citizen Kane.....but ""Jack The Giant Killer"" gets my ""Special Place of Honor"" award; I saw it on its first release when I was 11, and it became the final, yet most endearing example of cinematic magic (next to ""The Wizard of OZ"")that I was ever to experience as a child.",978134400,29,3286,5.352713178294573

'Jack The Giant Killer' seemed no less thrilling at the time; there are plenty of monsters and special effects. Seen as an adult however the film does not have the craft and attention to detail of the Harryhausen/Schneer films like JASON & SINBAD, but nevertheless is an entertaining movie which I still enjoy. It has good pace and colour, and Torin Thatcher is an absolute joy as the evil Pendragon, virtually re-creating his role as Sokura in SINBAD. Watching as an adult, some lines of dialogue are so bad as to be brilliant: KING MARK (to Jack) 'Your father was in the Royal Archers?' JACK: 'Yes, sire, he fell at the battle of Land's End'....(Presumably this was the only part of Cornwall the writer had heard of) LEPRECHAUN (to Jack, when Pendragon threatens to turn him into a black ram) 'This magic coin can be an antidote, to giving you a cashmere coat...'

It  was a major box office disappointment, however, and the studio decided to  ""save"" the movie by RE-EDITING it and ADDING SEVERAL SONGS and a  MUSICAL soundtrack.

Since reuniting the cast for retakes more than a decade later would have been problematic if not downright impossible, the film was ""played with"": some shots were slowed down and run back and forth, or simply repeated, to make the actors look like they were singing; or else some of the dialogue becomes ""sung"" (via looped-in singing voices) in the best recitative tradition. The best song, ""A Spectacle! A Spectacle!"" is sung--supposedly--by the villains as the Leprechaun instructs Jack to ""seize the bone"" (!) which turns into a magic whip to take out the empty suits of armor guarding evil Pendragon's castle.

418296,3,6301978641,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

I saw this film on release at a drive-in movie theatre, i.e. HUGE screen, i.e. scarier looking monsters and witches. Hence, nightmares followed that evening, especially of Pendragon. Never saw it again until recently, and wondered why these characters were perceived as so menacing. I could only remember the face of Pendragon and thought he was the Giant Jack killed. Nope. Memory only served to convey the evil non-claymation creatures. I originally thought they were not anywhere real looking, fake choppy movements, and rather hilarious. I believed only in the force of the super evil Prince of Darkness.

The court of witches and creatures were the creepiest I have ever seen in my life. I think this film is not appropriate for young children 5-7YO. I really still remember the nightmares I had that night, even today. So I could not wait to see if anything about the film was recalled and all I remember is that nasty satanic looking Pendragon.

So, what happened on the second viewing after 55yrs or so. SAME THING!! It had the exact effect on my dreams and was so surprised as I was laughing at all the poor quality special effects. Guess this film is underrated because I never had a problem with the Sinbad or Jason series.

Thank goodness for comic relief from the Imp, why not just call him a leprechaun?? He was delightful and hoped to see more of him. The sweet demure Princess Elaine actually looked more attractive as a witch, bravo makeup department!

418299,4,6301978641,"This was a healthy dose of Ray Harryhausen-similar nostalgia that was most likely spearheaded by Wah Chang (one of Harryhausen's contemporaries)  that brightened up my day.

The story was a mix of all sorts of themes but the stop-motion animation was adequately performed for the era (1962) and the story, while similar to many others, had our man Jack (a farmer's son), defeating a giant through treachery and deceit and winning the hand of the princess - apparently for just being alive.

Our evil wizard, aptly played by Torin Thatcher who had roles in many, many movies, was given ample opportunity to defeat Jack but just didn't take advantage of them all.  Sadly, he changed himself into a dragon just on the outside chance he could defeat this untrained farm boy but, alas, farm boy won anyway.

The effects could have been better, but the producers allowed no extra time or expense, so the stop-motion work was a labor of love. The paint jobs on the models look pretty thick and artificial, instead of organic... but the horned Cormoran (looking much like the cyclops from SINBAD) projects real menace.

418354,5,6301978641,"Jack The Giant Killer is a pretty neat little fairy tale that was released in 1962. Trying to capture the magic of the 1958 Harryhausen classic 'The 7th Voyage of Sinbad', Jack the Giant Killer is inferior in every way, but still most enjoyable to the child in all stop motion fans.

I owned two pervious editions of this film but I had heard rumors that a version released by Legend films was the horrid version that was dubbed into a ersatz musical! I only wanted that version to have a laugh from time to time.

Unfortunately, it is not the case and even worse it is by far the worst looking of the three releases of the film. If you must own the film look for the Good Times version released in 1:33 as it is the closest to the proper aspect ratio released to date, even though all releases have some cropping issues.

I saw Jack the Giant Killer in a theater as a child and I must say it haunted my memory for decades before I was able to see it again. Oddly enough the second time I saw the film was at least 20 years after the theater viewing. It was playing on TV and it was the bizarre musical version?!! (which I knew nothing about at the time!)I was completely disappointed because the musical version is absolutely horrible.

It took me a number of years before I would see the original theatrical version and it was every bit as good as I remembered with the exception of the stop motion looking better to me as a kid, regardless the film holds up fairly well. The giants are obviously inspired by Ray Harryhausen's wonderful Cyclops from 7th Voyage, but all in all, it's a pretty good film for fantasy film fans from days gone by and It's pretty hard not to like a two headed giant!

418419,4,6301978641,"This review is for Jack the Giant Killer (1962), not Jack the Giant Slayer (2013).  Kerwin Mathews did a few fantasy movies in the 50s and 60s.  They were geared for kids to see at the movie matinee, but most adults enjoyed them as well.  The special effects for the time were decent, many done by the master of stop motion animation Ray Harryhausen.  This movie wasn't done by Harryhausen, but the special effects are decent considering it was made over forty years ago. This version has Jack trying to rescue a kidnapped princess.  He encounters a cyclops, a roc (giant bird), skeletons, undead soldiers, and an evil sorcerer. Well worth owning at this price of under seven dollars.

418420,4,6301978641,"I'm reviewing this film because the only review here is for a entirely different film 'The Giant Killer' asylum films!

Jack The Giant Killer is a pretty neat little fairy tale that was released in 1962. Trying to capture the magic of the 1958 Harryhausen classic 'The 7th Voyage of Sinbad', Jack the Giant Killer is inferior in every way, but still most enjoyable to the child in all stop motion fans.

I owned two pervious editions of this film but I had heard rumors that this version released was the horrid version that was dubbed into a ersatz musical! I only wanted that version to have a laugh from time to time.

Unfortunately, it is not the case and even worse it is by far the worst looking of the three releases of the film. If you must own the film look for the good times version released in 1:33 as it is the closest to the proper aspect ratio, even though all releases have some cropping issues.

I saw Jack the Giant Killer in a theater as a child and I must say it haunted my memory for decades before I was able to see it again. The strange thing is the second time I saw the film it was at least 20 years after the theater viewing. It was playing on TV and it was the bizarre musical version?!! (which I knew nothing about at the time!)I was completely disappointed because the musical version is absolutely horrible.

It took me a number of years before I would see the original theatrical version and it was every bit as good as I remembered..ok maybe the stop motion looked better to me as a kid, but the film held up fairly well. The giants are obviously inspired by Ray Harryhausen's wonderful Cyclops from 7th Voyage, but all in all, it's a pretty good film for fantasy film fans from days gone by. It's pretty hard not to like a two headed giant!  If you like Harryhausen films, you'll find this interesting.",1374019200,25,1835,4.350877192982456

So now it will hold this place, until something is made that is worse, whitch probably can not happen!

When it comes up, I merely fast-forward till it's past, and I only lose about a minute and a half's worth of the picture, and while that is a bit annoying, it's not really that serious a problem.

Slightly older I saw ""Jack the Giant Killer"" at the theater and loved it too. It is not as awesome as 7th Voyage but is still an enjoyable film for the young in imagination. I just finished rewatching it and it was fun. If I had to compare ""Jack..."" to another film, I think Bert I Gordon's The Magic Sword, another guilty pleasure of my childhood, is close but not quite as good.

In later years, I was disappointed that the only version shown on TV was the version re-scored (badly) as a musical to play down to the kiddie market. Yes, it is a children's story, but children raised on Grimm can take their giants, sorcerors and dragons straight and not condescendingly camped up.

The stop motion effects were done by a team that included Tim Baar, Wah Chang, Gene Warren and Jim Danforth, associated with Project Unlimited that did effects work for George Pal's movies and for The Outer Limits tv series. And for those who have mentioned Harryhausen in their reviews, Harryhausen's first animation job was with George Pal's Puppetoon series before WWII and Jim Danforth worked with Harryhausen on his last film ""Clash of the Titans"".",1344038400,3,1259,4.591111111111111

Adjusting my 55 inch screen color setting to full still produced a washed out image.  Contrast brightness was high and made for too bright a picture image.

Only one skipping point was noted in only one viewing test of the dvd.

One note must be made to the effects  work in this film which was not produced by the Lengenary Ray Harryhousen as people mistake.

The monsters are a bit less detailed and not quite as fluid as the great master.

I'm sure the other reviewers will explain how the producer coveted the tale so much he hired Nathan Juran (who directed Sinbad) and as many of the same actors as he could... so I'll skip that. As an adult (lol) I realize that chief animator Jim Danforth was still learning his craft - you can glimpse ghostly animation guide sticks in the frame a couple of times and even catch sight of the stuffing on the first fairy tale giant - but this thing still retains a wonderful cheezy richness of image, concept and execution that will always exemplify, to me at least, the essence of a ""fantasy"" movie. Don't expect CG wonders, but if ya dig animation give it a try!

418550,4,6301978641,"Being a fan of stop-motion animation, I have heard about this movie for years. The closest I got to seeing it was a trailer for the film which I purchased on 8mm many years ago. Thanks to this DVD release, I finally got to see the entire film for the first time. ""Jack The Giant Killer"" is a rip-off of Ray Harryhausen's ""Seventh Voyage of Sinbad"". The actor who played Sinbad, Kerwin Mathews was even hired to play Jack, along with Torin Thatcher who plays the villian in both films. Nevertheless, ""Jack The Giant Killer"" still delivers. The stop-motion sequences were done by Wah Chang, Gene Warren and Jim Danforth. This team turned out some memorable monsters such as ""Cormoran"", the first giant seen in the film, who also doubles as a jester. There is also a two headed variant of Comoran seen towards the end of the film. The films villain, ""Pendragon,"" turns himself into a dragon to fight Jack. While said dragon is a bit cartoonish, the sequence is very imaginative and well done. The only creature I could not accept was the Kraken. The effects team must have ran out of money by the time that scene was shot because the kraken model is crude by any standard. The stop-motion animation itself is consistent throughout the film and very well done. I did notice that most of the film is very bright to the point of almost being over-exposed. This could of course be due to the age of the prin or the transfer process. All in all, I enjoyed the film. It was worth the wait.",1331769600,2,1480,4.485185185185185

It is very much in the same realm as Ray Harryhausen movies like: The Clash of the Titans, and The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad. Considering that this movie came out before those, the stop-animation is really good.

Although the Producer Edward Small hired Director Nathan Juran, the handsome hero Kerwin Mathews and the villain Torin Thatcher from the similar and very successful film the 7th Voyage of Sinbad (1958), it lacked the most important ingredient, the genius of Ray Harryhausen, master of the motion picture special effects and most famous for his brand of stop-motion model animation.
The monsters and fight scenes in Jack the Giant killer are laughable and hardly interesting. A disappointment!

Sadly,it does not feature effects by Ray Harryhausen ,thje ones in this movie being courtesy of Howard Anderson. They are okay but below the standards set by Harryhausen and this make it a lesser movie .A nice ,fun movie but not top drawer fantasy cinema.
The action starts in Cornwall. The king's daughter receives a gift from the evil sorceror (Thatcher)who is out to gain the throne for himself. It is a music box in the shape of a castle and it incorporates a dancing clockwork figure which at night turns into a giant .The giant takes the hapless girl prisoner and it is up to the dauntless farmer's boy Jack to tackle the creature and slay him. That is not the end of the sorceror's plans and he takwes the girl prisoner yet again and hypnotises her into being a mindles puppet and slave of his will. Jack must swing into action once more aided by an imp of the bottle ,liberated by Jack.
Matthews is agile and engaging  and Thatcher a suitably hissable villain .The effects let the side down now and agin -the giant is effective and I suspect a mite scary for very young viewers but the sea serpent is very weak and more than a bit rubbery looking .
On balance this is an okay fantasy but misses the Harryhausen touch .

When I watched it, I was completely dumb founded as it had been turned into an ersatz musical!

I have since found two different releases on DVD both are the original non musical version. One released by Goodtimes is in fullscreen and the other is in widescreen 1:66 format which is the correct aspect ratio. The Goodtimes release is listed as the musical version, but is in fact the correct original non musical version! The widescreen release looks a little better than the fullscreen version and there is little difference in the formats so don't pay the aftermarket price for the fullscreen version, it isn't how it was viewed in theaters.

But then, this is a film totally for little kids.  Bad guys and monsters are ugly, the hero and princess who falls in love with him are beautiful.  So my son (6) was extremely happy and excited to see it, laughing and running around the room grabbing himself.

418682,4,6301978641,"Jack The Giant Killer is a great family fantasy movie. I've never seen the musical version, but it sounds like a hideous botch-up, and I can't believe people are disappointed because this DVD is of the original version and not some re-hash that had nothing to do with the production's original intention.

I think the film is excellent just the way it is. It's the tale of a simple farmer (Jack) who gets caught up in an evil wizard's plans to abduct a beautiful princess to be his bride. I've heard it said that the musical version was created to tone down some of the film's more frightening moments, and I can see why younger childeren could get nightmares after watching some sequences. There are several such scenes. Early on in the film, the princess is having a party and one of her birthday gifts is a miniature dancing jester in a musical box. Creepy enough to watch as it is, this ugly thing comes alive after dark and grows into a hideous giant demon. In another scene, ghostly flying witches descend on a ship to try and seize the princess, who is being smuggled away to a secret location to protect her. This sequence, involving some very freaky apparitions, genuinely frightened me as a child, especially the moment when the ghost in the guise of a skeleton in a wedding dress surprised the princess in a small dark cabin. Eek!

The animated monsters are of variable quality, ranging from the enlarged music box demon (the best) to the sea serpent that appears near the end (the worst). Maybe the money started to run out towards the end of the film! But the plot is engaging and never dull, mostly involving Jacks battle with the hammy but evil King Pendragon who has designs on the princess and is sending all these monsters to kidnap her, but also involving sub-plots such as the part where the princess is turned evil by a spell from Pendragon and almost double-crosses Jack - until the spell is broken.

All in all, tremendous fun. Yes it does look a bit dated now, and a lot of kids aren't going to be enthralled this easily any more, but it can still give an hour and a half's worth of solid entertainment.",1096416000,17,2127,4.51948051948052

418684,2,6301978641,"I don't mean to berate the great Jim Danforth, but this is an extremely low budget rip-off of The 7TH Voyage of Sinbad. The legend is that producer Edward Small turned down Harryhausen's pitch for 7th Voyage. Ray went to Columbia, and the finished product was a huge hit, making 12 mill in America alone in 1958!!
Small probably kicked himself a few times, and decided to make an exact duplicate of the film at MGM. He hired the same director (Nathan Juran) and same stars (Kerwin Mathews and Torin Thatcher).Unfortunately, the animation models were not of the quality of Sinbad, and the stop motion is rushed (Small had a very tight budget. The result is a fun film for kids, but fantasy film fanatics do not regard this as a classic. Jack (Mathews) must rescue a possessed Princess from an evil sorcerer who wants to take over the Kingdom.
Columbia actually sued Small for ripping off Sinbad, and the film remained in limbo for many years. In the late 80's, MGM turned the movie into a musical!!!!!! They dubbed over dialogue and made it look like the characters are singing! This version was shown on the Disney channel for a few years, and it is a sight to behold. In the mid ninties, MGM restored the film for a VHS release, and now the ""widescreen"" DVD. There is some controversy regarding the films original aspect ratio (see stopmotionanimation.com).
Kids will enjoy, but stop motion fans regard this film as a footnote in history.",1078272000,18,1439,4.669291338582677
418685,1,6301978641,"I grew up and loved the musical version of this film as shown on the disney channel.  I was disappointed to learn that only the dry and humorless version has been released on dvd.  The masters at GoodTimes DVD made a crippling mistake and failed miserably by not making this version the musical version.  This version of the movie is not worth the mere $4.95 that it costs here.  The layer that the music adds is priceless...I watched the musical version of the movie with my girlfriend, and it was like falling in love all over again.  You don't get that feeling from the original version.
I'm planning on doing my own transfer of the musical version from VHS to DVD (for personal uses only, sorry guys, you're just going to have to wait until they come out with the musical version.  I bet you're jealous.)  I'm also going to add a special feature that will allow me to loop the songs over and over again, and I'll be singing ""a spectacle"" until the wee hours of the morning.

Not really all that great an actor, his dashing looks and his sincerity were the foundation for a series of wonderful ""fantasy"" films of the late 50s and early 60's:  ""The 7th Voyage of Sinbad,"" ""Three Worlds of Gulliver,"" ""Warrior Empress,"" and this little gem.  Undoubtedly not as marvelous as Ray Harryhausen's stop motion animation, Howard Anderson's little creations are fun and imaginative, given the time this movie was made (1962).  Torin Thatcher is appropriately hammy as Pendragon; Judi Meredith was ingenuishly funny as the princess, especially in her hammy witch sequences; Anna Lee was appropriately British as the betraying witch; and Walter Burke was delightful as the dwarfish aide to Pendragon.  The dragon teeth soldiers are hilarious; everyone seems to be having fun and it can be said, they don't make movies like this anymore!

I gave this film 3 stars based on ""the Film"" because...
-It was such a blatant band-wagon move after ""The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad"".  It's hard to watch without noticing parodies.
-The giants inexplicably all have goat's legs, just like the cyclops in SVOS!!
-Same director and lead actors as SVOS...  in the SAME ROLES!!!
-Some scenes drag on, even action scenes!  ""let's show more monsters LONGER!!!""  The witch scene on the ship NEVER ENDS!!
-A little magical helper, just like SVOS.  He even makes the same bargain for his freedom!!
-Battle between giant and serpent, just like SVOS battle between Cycplops and Dragon.
-Editing is silly at times.  Senes were obviously cut (gaunlet hall has arms cut off and blades broken but not a clue how it happened!) while others go on... and on... and on.....
-Acting is valiant considering the script!!  This thing was obviously thrown together.  I particularly enjoyed the high-school acting of Judy Meredith.  Kind of like watching a car wreck... you just can't look away.
-The monsters are extremely crude in every aspect, from sculpting to animation.  The funny thing is, the animation seams to get a little better as the film rolls along, like they created the sequences in script order.
-Jim Danforth (though I never see his name on the Credits?) needed to understudy under Harryhausen a bit longer.  He had very little knowledge of human or animal physiology.  This made his creatures look cartoonish and less believable.  Do you like shiney monsters?  To his credit, they definately have character.
-Despite all of this, it is a fun film.  Just need to get over the SVOS ""cloning"".
  As a value priced DVD, I'd have to give it 5 stars.  Here's why;
-Picture quality is better than could ever be expected for this obscure film (at this price).  Someone in Hong Kong must of had this on ice!!
-Ditto for sound quality.  As good as could be expected for a featureless DVD.
-Packaging is better than adequate.  They actually Screened a nice image on the disk!
-NOT THE MUSICAL!!!
Given all of this, I'd still recommend this DVD for Harryhausen Fans.  It really puts his skills in perspective.  It is also a whimsical and enjoyable movie in it's own right.  I just could not get over the ""Sinbad"" thing!!",1049932800,18,2268,4.801033591731266
418731,3,6301978641,"Even if this is not as good as Ray Harryhausen at his best in ""Jason and the Argonauts"" and ""The 7th Voyage of Sinbad"", it is certainly as good a quality as the later Sinbad's he did. Anderson's creatures may be a little rough around the edges by todays special effects standards but it is still quite entertaining for the whole family. Most children will find it great fun. There are numerous monster creatures and several interesting good characters. Kerwin Mathews and the rest the cast do above average performances. The sets and music help draw us into this wonderful adventure fantasy story. If you like Fantasy movies you will probably enjoy this one. Did you miss the price on this DVD? Talk about a bargain!

This single layer disc runs 1 hour 36 minutes and is playable worldwide (NTSC). The movie stars Kerwin Williams & the beautiful Judi Meredith and directed by Nathan Juran. There are no special features on this DVD except for scene index and play. The DVD is worth it even at this price.

From Wikipedia:  ""The film was loosely based on the traditional tale ""Jack the Giant Killer"" and features extensive use of stop-motion animation. The film was directed by Nathan H. Juran and later re-edited and re-released as a musical by producer Edward Small. The reason for the change to music was on the grounds that Columbia Pictures, which released The 7th Voyage of Sinbad, threatened to sue Small. The original print without the music got released 30 years later with no protest from Columbia Pictures, while United Artists continues to own the rights to the musical version of the film. The film brought together Mathews, Juran, Small, and actor Torin Thatcher, all four of whom worked on 7th Voyage.""",1509148800,,857,5.028169014084507
