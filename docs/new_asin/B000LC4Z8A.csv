2703939,5,B000LC4Z8A,"This was one of our favorite shows and will be again as soon as Fox brings it back for Season 2!!  Based in Chicago, ""Thesis"" (as his boss calls him) gets a job in upper management for an airline company right out of college (thanks to his thesis work)... he tries to be responsible, but things somehow always go awry... his friends have a few screws loose, his co-worker (an older woman) is constantly making advances toward him, and his boss... well, I guess you'll have to watch for yourself, because can't come up with a good way to describe him!  Overall, this is a very smart and very funny fresh new comedy and definitely worth the money for the entire first season!  I just checked the Fox website and Season 2 begins June 10th... I can't wait!",1173139200,10,752,4.434782608695652
2704042,5,B000LC4Z8A,"I have no idea why this series was canceled so soon. It is very, very funny, makes me laugh out loud severel times per episode. Bret Harrison, and Mimi Rogers are both terrific. Also, Phillip Baker Hall is GREAT, some of you may remember him as ""Bookman"" the library cop on an episode of Seinfeld. This series is definitely worth checking out.",1282348800,,343,4.548387096774194
2704043,4,B000LC4Z8A,"I watched ""The Loop"" when it was originally on the air and I was really happy when they brought it back for a second season. I just hope that this first season DVD sells well enough that they'll release the second season too.",1218499200,3,225,4.255813953488372
2704044,5,B000LC4Z8A,"Bret Harrison is a doll.  Too bad season 2 isn't half as good.  Check out his show ""Reaper.""",1212364800,,92,4.055555555555555
2704045,4,B000LC4Z8A,Was recommended on Amazon and it brought back memories so I picked it up. Yet another show I liked that didn't last.,1195516800,,116,4.318181818181818
2704046,5,B000LC4Z8A,"This is actually one of the only shows which I found myself laughing out loud to!  Show is quite funny at times and should have been picked back up but again, FOX missed the boat.  Almost as bad as they screwed up Reunion.  Regardless, Mimi Rogers is very good in this as well.  The chemistry between the characters is undeniable.  All in all, very good show and enjoy it while you can.  Pick it up for this great price, you won't be disappointed.",1190937600,3,447,4.325301204819277
2704047,5,B000LC4Z8A,What was Fox thinking when they canceled this show?  A gem of a sit-com!,1185494400,,72,4.142857142857143
2704048,5,B000LC4Z8A,"The best TV series in a long long time. Great comedy, vey original. Too bad it didn't get the attention it deserved during the first season. It is now back on TV again with a new second series, cant wait to pick that up as well when it hits DVD.",1185494400,,245,3.92
2704049,4,B000LC4Z8A,"This show had a ton of promise.  I caught most of the shows that aired in the spring of '06 and laughed myself silly.  I'm a recent grad and could very easily see myself bumbling around at a job that is dominated by people with tons of experience.  The variety of characters was great.  Sam is the only one that is really bright, while his friends seem to still be stuck back in high school.  I don't think that's too far off when you graduate from college.  Some people are ready for the real world and others aren't, but you're still friends.

Anyway, I started watching the second season.  Not only is the intro not as good, they've axed some of the characters that made for funny moments in the original 7 episodes.  It's sad when a company only gives a show 7 episodes to get an audience, then dismantles it, hoping to get people the following year.  What they forgot is that shows need time to develop.  Other great shows didn't do well in their first season(as far as ratings go) like Full House, and then became a hit.  The writing in the first season is edgy and freakin' funny.  Don't kid yourself into thinking that the new version is too.  It's funny, but so very far from the original in it's writing and chemistry.  BOOOOOOOO Fox.",1182729600,4,1244,4.394736842105263
2704050,5,B000LC4Z8A,"This is the original season of The Loop which was an awesome show.  Unfortunately, Fox ruined it in the new season by taking off some of the original cast members.  At least we still have these DVD's.",1181606400,5,200,4.378378378378378
2704051,5,B000LC4Z8A,"There aren't many well-scripted sitcoms on TV today, and The Loop is one of them.  Not because it's not well-scripted, but because it's not on TV!  Such a travesty.  The Loop is one of the best television sitcoms to come around since Friends or Will & Grace.  It's smart, edgy, and doesn't dumb down its comedy for viewers that would be better off watching goofy shows like According to Jim or reruns of Full House.  I was fortunate enough to catch The Loop on Fox last year when it was on, and immediately purchased this DVD collection to re-watch and laugh along with the cast.  I can't wait until Season Two comes out on TV in June, but I'm sad to think that nobody will catch it (or find it, for that matter) and that that will be the end of a truly fantastic sitcom written and acted by people who care about making their audience laugh out loud.",1175558400,7,851,4.320754716981132
8161247,5,B000LC4Z8A,Another fantastic show that was cancelled. Just don't understand how so many awful comedies stay on the air for years and something this funny gets scrapped after a year.,1473811200,,170,4.896551724137931
8161248,5,B000LC4Z8A,Great show everyone needs to watch it,1456876800,,37,4.428571428571429
8161249,3,B000LC4Z8A,"Has a few funny parts, but it really is juvenile and grating on the nerves. Too expensive for so few episodes.",1455753600,,110,4.285714285714286
8161250,5,B000LC4Z8A,Funny!,1447113600,,6,6.0
8161251,5,B000LC4Z8A,"I love this show. I was a fan when it was on FOX. Of which, it ran intermittently at best.

I hoped and prayed that it would find an audience and a home. Alas it did not. However, one can now view all 17 episodes (7 in season 1 and 10 in season 2).

In short the story revolves around a young executive (Sam) at an airline company and his struggle to balance work and play.

As a young man in the world he lives with His slacker brother. A brunette who is a seemingly unavailable love interest and a blond who is an attractive bartender. As one would expect hi-jinx ensues. Comedy abounds in this environment. However, in my opinion, it is the situations at work which fuel the most laughs and for me is very reminiscent of the type of outrages comedy one would see in shows such as ""Soap"", ""Police Squad"" and much later ""30 Rock"" and ""Community"".

I cannot recommend this more. Give it a try. You will enjoy it.",1440201600,2,912,4.224137931034483
8161252,5,B000LC4Z8A,"One of the best shows I have seen in a while, too bad it only made it to season two.",1424563200,,84,3.25
8161253,5,B000LC4Z8A,"I remembered this show was on Fox and me only being in Middle School, I didn't understand most of the jokes.
I personally liked, and still do like it. It's definitely relate-able and also funny. Uses a similar formula that romantic comedies do: the main character can't seem to get the one they love cos there's a constant misunderstanding between the two of em'.
Definitely gets kinda' upsetting, but hey *shrug* !

Gotta' love The Loop !",1408665600,,439,4.701298701298701
8161254,5,B000LC4Z8A,Smart and witty humor. i was sorry it did not last. Really stand apart from most of the sitcoms out there.,1359072000,,106,4.095238095238095
8161255,5,B000LC4Z8A,"The Loop is something that you see about once every 10 years. It's a quirky, funny, realistic show about a guy who makes ends meet. From the weird way of cursing to the wacky stunts on the job, The Loop will keep you entertained for all 6 episodes and then the second season. Plus, the fact that the episodes are less than 25 minutes helps when you've got a time crunch.",1308960000,,370,4.225352112676056
8161256,5,B000LC4Z8A,"the main guy of Loop is in the new ""breaking in"" show and was in ""reaper"". If you've seen the other shows you'll see that the love plot lines are similar but each has its own uniquely funny aspects. definitely is a show to check out. season two is okay (lost a lot of the original cast) but haven't seen it available for purchase yet.",1304553600,,334,4.153846153846154
