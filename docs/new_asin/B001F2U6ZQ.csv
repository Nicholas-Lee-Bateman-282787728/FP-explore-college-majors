8311030,5,B001F2U6ZQ,"From the beginning this has been a `love it or hate it' series. If you have stuck with `When They Cry' for this long, it cannot because of a feeling of ambivalence. The intensity that closes out one story arc and the sympathy that one feels for Rena at the start of the second will easily carry audiences into the final volume of this series leaving them wanting more. This is the horror series of the year.",1227225600,6,407,4.298701298701299
