8524244,3,B0082HGROG,If your a Sabbath fan like I am then you have seen most of this before. France 1970-Kirshners 1975 and Pittsburgh 1978. This wouldnt be sooo bad except that my old VHS tapes look and sound better than this. The only thing new here are some interviews but most are just crappy sounding audio bits. Was worth watching once but what am I going to do with it now???,1364428800,25,361,4.246376811594203
