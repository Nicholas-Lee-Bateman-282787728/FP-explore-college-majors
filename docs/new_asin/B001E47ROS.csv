8296279,4,B001E47ROS,"For a spaghetti western this is good. Could use more action, fast forwarded just a tiny bit in spots. ;-) Fun movie, good attack scene (spoiler alert - the indian swinging on a rope and knocking the guy off the horse was pretty good - not sure where they filmed this but the safety crowd was not around at the time ;-)  ). I'd give it 3.5 stars. There's a whole lot that's a lot worse than this and passes itself off as a ""western."" Predictable but fun, good costuming (other than ""biker gang""), decent acting, nothing that's horribly campy or cheesey. The leather clad troupe that looks like a biker gang was totally out of costume and place, but the rest was decently authentic. Now - if you want to see Franco Nero in his BEST role, watch Companeros! Ok, if you want the plot synopsis: a group of robbers murder his parents, and he (Nero) is a young boy at the time. A bear cub befriends him when he is hiding in a cave, he then gets befriended by a indian tribe and grows up with them. An oil baron comes to town next to the indian settlement to extract the black gold, and discovered a rich field of oil under the indian burial ground. Can you guess what happens next? Anyway, good camera shots, decent acting, a solid film, other than the younger leather clad biker looking crowd. I'd watch this again before I watched any of the movies made in the last 10 years.",1440633600,,1369,4.3062015503875966
