8744944,4,B019EFFR22,"I bought this DVD for the film The Black Eagle of Santa Fe, so I will only be reviewing that movie.  It is a 1964 West German-Italian-French made, English-dubbed Western.  The town Santa Fe doesn't figure in the story.  It takes place in a fort town called Eagle Rock or something like that.  A local cattle baron is using local Native Americans (by lying to them) to get rid of the settlers in the area because he wants to control the region.  He figures the Cavalry will eliminate the indigenous peoples and he will become a cattle king.  Brad Harris (always a welcome sight) and Horst Frank play investigators trying to find out what's going on.  The DVD is excellent quality except for two issues. The picture is surrounded all around by black bands (not widescreen or full screen), and the dialogue falls back to German on two or three short occasions.  Other than that this DVD is a good buy since this film is not available except on another multi-film DVD.  Recommended for fans of Euro Westerns.",1470009600,,1004,4.595505617977528
