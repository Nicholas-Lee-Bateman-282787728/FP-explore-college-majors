8128702,5,B000G1R4U2,"I bought this video for my son who is four years old. He is very much into action/hero type movies and he enjoys Robinita Hood on our road trips. As an elementary educator, I limit his movie/TV time to road trips and ""sick"" days. Even though he has a wide variety of movies to choose from, he often comes back to this movie and Peter Pan. It is a great option to introduce or explore different versions of a story or movie. We have interesting discussions after each viewing. Fun movie for both boys and girls.",1274313600,3,510,4.322916666666667
8128703,5,B000G1R4U2,"Fun, engaging, & educational. I use this in my teaching. It's instructional value is a classic folktale with alternate cultural images. My students learn that folktales/fairytales  are part if an oral tradtion and as such teach them about the culture in which the setting is based. This is why they are on the non-fiction or ""informative"" side of the media center. Really, go into any library you will not find these in the fiction section, they are in 398.2:)

The multimedia aspect helps English language learners, and Robin Hood is a woman in this version---Robinita Hood and her Merry Chicas:)",1216425600,4,597,4.96
8128704,5,B000G1R4U2,"I have used this series several times for a storytime dealing with fairy tales with a twist.  Each one I have shown has been excellent-upbeat, good use of star's voice talents and not too off-beat (the children can still tell what the orginal fairy tale is and how this differs from it).  I would highly recommend this for anyone who is dealing with fratured fairy tales.",1199836800,2,371,4.606060606060606
