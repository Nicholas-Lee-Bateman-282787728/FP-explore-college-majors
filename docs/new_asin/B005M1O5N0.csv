4832899,4,B005M1O5N0,When I saw some of the reviews that said it was just a bunch of third season episodes I was worried that it was a re-release of episodes that were party of the previous set. This is not that it is the next 18 episodes that follow the episodes released as the U.S. Complete Third Season. It has similar features to the previous U.S. releases.,1411603200,6,341,4.2615384615384615
4832900,1,B005M1O5N0,My Fourth Season set came and it's actually the Third Season episodes which I just watched!!! I'm not happy about this - I was looking forward to seeing some new episodes!,1410825600,,171,4.548387096774194
4832901,2,B005M1O5N0,This is a jocke. It is neither the fourth season nor any season at all; only an inconexed mixture of parts mostly from the fifth. I returned it because I already have the original material.,1409961600,3,189,4.428571428571429
4832902,2,B005M1O5N0,"After purchasing the fourth season and realizing most of the episodes were on Season 3, I wrote to the seller and she graciously refunded my money.  Then I read other peoples reviews and found out that in the US, there are more episodes in a season then there are in Canada, so that explained the discrepancy.  In the US, you can by-pass Season 4 and go straight to Season 5.",1408752000,,375,4.3428571428571425
4832903,5,B005M1O5N0,its a good clean movie that you can relate to. we can`t wait for next series to come out. Very good,1399507200,,99,3.761904761904762
4832904,5,B005M1O5N0,"If you order the first three season of Heartland (As seen on GMC/UP) they are off from this set.  If you order this season 4, you will have the same episodes of Season 3 (As seen on GMC/UP).  I made the mistake of ordering this, when I went and looked at the complete list of episodes, this season matches my season 3 (as seen on GMC/UP).  Thought this information would be helpful to many.  The GMC/UP DVDs have more episodes on them compared to these, however you can only buy Season 1 through 3, which is actually Season 4 of the Canada Version.

Other than that this series is really good! It's hard to stop watching!",1393372800,20,621,4.318965517241379
4832905,1,B005M1O5N0,It is the complete Season Three instead of Season Four. I am very disappointed in Amazon for taking advantage of me. Even the the episodes were shortened.................,1392249600,,170,5.333333333333333

4832988,1,B005M1O5N0,"Do not buy this to watch this on Amazon Instant Video. It is wrong. AIV offers Seasons 1-3 free to watch on Prime and that is great, but if you want to purchase Season 4 to continue watching you will miss an entire season. According to the official Heartland CBC Website: Season 4 Episode 1 should be titled, Homecoming. Amazon Instant Video is selling Season 5 as Season 4 and there is no way to watch the 18 episodes they excluded from the real Season 4. Amazon customer service did refund my money, but they have it in their notes that they have no intention of fixing this error, so there is no way to watch the entire series on instant video without the loss of an entire season. Also, all subsequent seasons are off by one year as well.",1467244800,4,742,4.307142857142857

4832990,1,B005M1O5N0,"I am giving this a One Star rating because after watching the first 4 seasons included with Amazon Prime, they are requiring that I pay to watch any more episodes. I think it's pretty underhanded to give us enough to become invested in the show and characters only to say ""Whoa - now you gotta pay extra if you want to see more."" You should either have it included with Prime or NOT included with Prime.",1466467200,,403,4.315789473684211

From what I can figure, I'm missing at least one season between the end of season 3 and the beginning of this. Really don't want to watch this until I've seen the missing season or so.

4833018,1,B005M1O5N0,"I gave this one star because the company that boxed these pulled a fast one on the viewer.  I have all the seasons on disc - SEASON 4 AND SEASON 5 ARE THE SAME - save your money!!!!!
What they did when they boxed Season 1 for distribution they pulled 9 episodes from Season 2 as viewed on TV.  Season 2 discs are TV Season 2 Episodes 10 through 18 AND TV Season 3 Episode 1 -14.  CONFUSED YET - I WAS!!!  Season 3 discs are TV season 3 Episodes 15 - 18 AND TV Season 4 Episodes 1 - 18.  Now you are caught up to the TV Episodes on Disc, BUT!!!!!  Instead of dropping out TV Season 4, cause you already have all of it if you bought Seasons 1 through 3, they just did it as a stand alone season 4 but it is Broadcast Season 5.  So if you buy the discs for Season 4 and Season 5 you get the same Episodes.  This was intentional and it ticked me off soooo 1 star.  I have better things to do with my money than buy duplicates.  Amazon did take the second set of Season 4 I bought after I spent 2 hours figuring out what the heck was going on so I now only have 2 sets instead of 3.

When I bought it from ""sellingdaddy"" they said it was brand new & that was not the case the first 3 DVDs where scratched, one was even sticky.  So far they are working after I cleaned them.  I would highly recommend this tv series for those 7 and up. If you love horses, drama, & romance this is your show.  Clean entertainment is hard to find these days. Very little swearing & when they do swear it is silenced on this DVD set. So I say give heartland a try, just don't mix the Canadian versions dvd box sets with the United States ones( seen on uplifting/GMC). They have different episodes. Example season 1 Canadian version only has 13 episodes where season 1 seen on GMC has 22 or 23 episodes.",1433721600,,771,4.1610738255033555

There are more episodes on these than on the original Canadian version and they are cheaper.  I have also noticed that they skip what few foul words that were originally aired.  Some might think that it is a bad copy but to be honest, I like it.  This is something that we as a family have been sitting around and watching every night.  My whole family loves Heartland!  I can't say enough good things about it.  Season 4 consists of episodes 68-85.  I can't wait for them to release Season 5 of the GMC/Up but I have found that Season 6 of the Canadian version consists of episodes 86-103 so it should match up with the same episodes from Season 4 of the GMC/Up DVD's.",1425427200,,832,4.316129032258065

The storylines are so great, the actors get you so involved into their lives, that at times you wish you could slap, shack or just hug them.  I bought the series for my granddaughter who loves horses, and then she told me, ""Grandma start watching this series, I know you will love it!"" and boy was she right.  Now she, and my daughter are all hooked on this series.  We live in America, and cannot watch the current series, but hopefully it will be on TV in the future, and available throught DVD in the future.  Watch this series and fall in love with all of them, you will be entertained.
