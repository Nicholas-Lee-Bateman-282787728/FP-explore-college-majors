582373,5,6303114040,"For those of you who grew up as a kid watching these kids on a weekly Sunday tv in black & white, this collection is a must.  They are truely a classic treasure.  I am missing a few out of this set and can't wait to  see if it gets re-released.  My children have grown to love these as well.  They are dearly loved and watched over & over!  It's clean, simple,  & decent for children.  And that's quite an accomplishment these days!  Adults will re-live the days of early television and the silver screen.  The commentary preceeding each volume gives a good brief informative  background about the 4 movies contained on each volume.  You'll want to  collect the whole set and the book that you can also buy with stories about  each ""short"" as they call it.  You can't find any of these  showing on cable!",945302400,14,804,4.36734693877551

7839669,5,6303114040,"A beautiful set!!! If you loved the Little Rascals of the sound era and want them uncut and original, this is the set! They are introduced by Film critic and Host Leonard Maltin who gives insight into the making of these short films by Hal Roach. Each VHS comes standard play mode, which is the best speed at which to record and play on this format.
Each VHS has 4 episodes on them for a total of 48 in this set! This is a rare set and even rarer are the DVD editions. I own this set and the next set, Volume 2 of VHS from Cabin Fever. I will attempt to transfer these to DVD soon! Get this set if you can and it is well worth it just to hear Leonard Maltin talk about the Gang and their antics over each episode. He gives a great introduction! Well Done!",1430697600,2,755,4.006622516556291

7839674,5,6303114040,"Our 4 boys grew up watching the little rascals. Our youngest son always mimicked Spanky.  Our boys are all gone from home now , but when they came home they always enjoyed watching with their children. It was so pleasant  to hear the laughter and the reminescing of our children and grandchildren.  I had purchased the series(all 12) several years ago then in January of 99  we lost our home to fire and of course the series was destroyed.  The first  thing our grandson wanted when he came in the spring to visit was to see  the videos, but they are no more.  This series is one classic treasure and  I would sure like to be able to purchase the series once again. The new  videos are OK but not as good as the old ones, which was what I had.",956534400,4,743,4.205673758865248
