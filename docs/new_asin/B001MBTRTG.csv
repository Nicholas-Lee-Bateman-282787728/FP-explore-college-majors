8610920,3,B001MBTRTG,The story starts at an orphanage outside of Moscow where 2 Canadian couples come to adopt a child each. Good shots of winter in this part of Russia and the children at the orphanage. It's sad when one child from a large family abandoned by their mum leaves for Canada on her own but once settled in her new life her new family work hard to bring out first one brother then another. In the end they realise they can't save them all and the story finishes. Nice young kids and caring adoptive families.,1235606400,,500,4.329787234042553
