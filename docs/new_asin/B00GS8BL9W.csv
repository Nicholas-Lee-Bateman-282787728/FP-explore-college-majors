From older hits to singing Dylan, just a treat to listen to and enjoy the beautiful harmonies and fabulous musicianship of these guys.  Could watch this all the time as it makes you feel good and knowing that they went on to produce a lot more wonderful music makes this worthwhile.  Thankyou.",1465862400,,358,4.650793650793651
