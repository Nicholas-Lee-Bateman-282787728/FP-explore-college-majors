8688793,5,B00PMA1GW4,"Magnificent production with top notch opera singers, ballet dancers, soloists and the orchestra of the Marriinsky. If they wanted to show off the new Mariinsky, its performers and its props, they succeeded",1443830400,,205,5.4375
8688794,5,B00PMA1GW4,"Really enjoyed this DVD especially Anna Netrebko,easilly the best singer in the world.",1441065600,,86,5.6923076923076925

8688796,5,B00PMA1GW4,"I loved every second of this disc. My response to the Russia/Putin haters is in the form of a comment to one of their reviews. I just completed my viewing of the Mariinsky Blu-ray with my wife. I am a tech freak and correct, I seek surround sound. The sound on this disc is fantastic regardless of the number of channels. The performance is incredible and beautifully paced. One issue on the first half of the program was some video distortion of digital backgrounds. It did not affect the artists and it did not irritate me too much. The show is quite spectacular and anyone who cares about music, singing, and dance... will have a hard time not loving it. My wife was stunned as well. Normally she gets out a book for music performance. I love the conductor, Netrebko, guest Placido Domingo was great... singing and conducting briefly... at the same time. Children on stage were great fun. The dance segments were wonderful. I love the moving stage and the new theater looks brilliant. I wish there had been a little talk about the history of the building. I visited in the 80s and was stunned by the whole experience... including the routine video broadcast to the nation which did not interfere with the experience of the theater goers. There is no nation with more love of art, I think. It's a good time to visit again... or more Blu-ray please.",1426982400,5,1350,4.582644628099174
8688797,4,B00PMA1GW4,"It is populated by today's first rate performers, and as expected each of the performance is good or excellent. However, it was not very enjoyable experience. Why? They tried too hard to impress during this Mariinsky II opening, they were busy to produce excellent pieces separately. As a result, it became a hotchpotch of unrelated music and ballet, and there is no unifying theme. Despite good performances by each artist, it was quite a trying experience to sit through the two hours. Showing Putin sitting in the audience several times was also quite a turn off.

I am sympathetic to some reviewers who gave bad reviews due to Gergiev and Netrebco pandering to Putin thug. However, these artist have little influence on Putin's political agenda, and they should not be judged based on this. These artists should be encouraged rather than judged. The only one in the world who can control the likes of Putin is the president of United States. The current occupant is doing absolutely nothing.  Punish Obama.",1424736000,,1010,4.935294117647059
8688798,1,B00PMA1GW4,"First off, the debate over the Blu-ray sound is a side issue and distraction. (As is, needless to say, the association with Putin, who does happen to be in the audience by the way.) Two-channel PCM is not the ne plus ultra in Blu-ray surround sound coding, but would be pefectly fine if that was the only issue under consideration. Unfortunately it is not. There are so many things wrong with this disk that questions of how many channels the sound was recorded in (or who was sitting in the audience) pale by comparison. To start with, the production itself is shockingly bad and banal. Oh, there are moments, brief moments--when Netrebko or Domingo sings for example--that are more than adequate, but so much of the production is as bad as a high school play. A weak one at that. Makes one wonder how Russia can still claim to be a world power, if it ever was. On the evidence of this disk, certainly not in opera, ballet, stagecraft, or bureaucratic decision-making. Many of the acts are actually (not metaphorically) children's productions, as if each of the Marinsky schools (of singing, ballet, etc.) fought for and succeeded in demanding a place in the program. Is that socialism? Or nepotism? That quality doesn't matter and the only thing that counts is keeping every bureaucratic fifedom happy? Then there is the actual production and staging. It's worse than I can describe (or than you will believe if I described it in detail). In this case, it's as if each of the engineers/ stage technicians at the ""new Marinsky"" fought to have his/her ""pet"" device put on display. And were allowed to! Conveyor belts, odd-ball lighting effects, video back projections, rising and dropping stage levels, enormous props that dwarf the performers and distract from their performances---the whole mish-mash of High School Musical theatrical trickery is wheeled on stage. Get this: Even the orchestra pit is raised and lowered. Why? For no particular reason, except to show off that the ""new Marinsky"" can do it! Then there is the weird photography and crazy video production values. Closeups of singers or dancers bizarrely (and distractingly) include the faces of unrelated children behind the performer mugging, talking to each other, looking off in another directions not paying attention, and generally, annoyingly distracting the viewer in every way possible from the actual performance taking place (a second-rate performance, but really...). And then there is the even more distracting problem of the video backgrounds in about half of the acts interfering with the photography. Remember in the old days of TV when wagon-wheels turned backward, airplane propellers stood still, and the striped shirt the weatherman wore before the ChromaScreen made these funny wavy lines or made parts of him disappear? Well, believe it or not, the contemporary equivalent of that is what takes place for long stretches of this stage show. The technical terms are ""interference bands"" and ""moire patterns,"" and the technical cause is that the background video scan rate (of the cheezy backprojected backgrounds--couldn't they afford real scenery?) is not synchronized with the foreground HD camera scan rate, but the technical reason doesn't matter: What matters is that half or more of the performances have wavy lines or moving dark bands shifting around behind the performers, like the snake in Magic Flute about to devour Papageno. Try to stay focused on the singing or dancing while a cityscape wiggles and throws up a series of moving black bands behind the performers. Then there is the weak conducting, weak performing, and bad miking of the orchestra. But I bettter stop before I can't. I forget the names of the Russian stage program director and the British TV productiion director, but they should both be fired, or maybe they have already died of embarrassment at the monstrosity they produced. Here's an idea. How about a good purge for old time's sake? Maybe Stalin had the solution. The whole Russian theater bureaucracy and governing body of the ""new Marinsky"" might benefit from some time in the Gulag if this is any evidence of the kind of productions they will produce as Russia's calling card in the West in the future.",1423440000,5,4227,5.031383737517832
8688799,5,B00PMA1GW4,"Well made Blu-ray with great performances plus glimpse of St Petersburg and the beautiful new theatre.  I actually visited St Petersburg in June 2014, watched ballet performances in both historical and new theatre of Mariinsky; therefore, this Blu-ray has brought back great memories. Mariinsky is just like St Petersburg, full of culture, and will take one a while to fully absorb......",1422576000,3,387,5.344262295081967
8688800,1,B00PMA1GW4,"ONLY STEREO??????  REALLY???????
Obviously I have not heard this, nor seen it, but just looking at the back cover as hard as I can, cannot make it really big enough to read well, but it says the sound is recorded in PCM Stereo.
Simply not good enough.  Sadly.",1420243200,4,259,4.375
