1713720,5,B000066RHA,"Let's Dance Salsa Beginning Lessons 1 DVD is BY FAR the best instructional dance DVD I've ever watched! I was amazed at how quickly I picked up on the steps - not just the beginner's steps, but more advanced ones as well. I now have the confidence to go out to clubs with my friends and dance up a storm. I feel healthier and happier since I started learning how to salsa dance with Let's Dance Salsa.",1096329600,4,401,4.220779220779221
1713721,5,B000066RHA,Marlon Silva has unbelievable charisma which really comes across in this DVD! Fun to watch and the lessons are easy to learn.,1096243200,2,125,4.7272727272727275
1713722,5,B000066RHA,"If you want to learn how to dance salsa like it is danced in the islands, Let's Dance Salsa are the DVDs for you! I learned how to dance to the rhythm of the salsa beat and was quickly up on my feet adding my own personal flair to the steps taught. Using the steps I learned, I had the confidence to start dancing at the local club the following weekend!",1096156800,5,354,4.0
1713723,5,B000066RHA,"I am a beginner salsa dancer, and after trying out several different instructional videos, I found this one to be the most helpful. The steps are easy to follow and explained thoroughly. Also, they not only teach you the basic steps, but also more complicated combinations and spins, which make you look great on the dance floor. I would definitely reccomend this video to anyone looking for a way to learn more steps, combinations and spins. It is an excellent start!",1065052800,5,468,4.790123456790123
1713724,1,B000066RHA,"I've been dancing Salsa for more than 2 years and had a look at several videos. This video series is so bad that you think it must be a joke, but after a while you start to realize that these guys are serious about it. Susie dances worse than many beginners I've seen, hopping around like she's doing jive. Marlon is more mumbling than dancing, his method in teaching is not having one. His moves are very basic and some look just ridiculous. Actually I'm speechless. If you're so bad it's a crime to let people pay $ for a DVD... At least my friends and I had a good laugh! If you want to get a fabulous instructional video, from beginner to advanced, get the RedHotSalsa series from Ron and Bethana Rosario! This is Salsa!",1048636800,12,724,4.330882352941177
1713725,1,B000066RHA,Only buy it when you want to have a good laugh...,1048464000,2,49,3.5454545454545454
1713726,1,B000066RHA,"I watched parts of all the ""Let's Dance Salsa"" DVDs and what a joke.  Is this guy serious?  He needs to get a few DVDs himself to find out about Salsa, rhythm, lead and following, and just general concepts of dancing.  I agree with a few other folks who wrote reviews...what qualifies him as an instructor?

I think he's doing an injustice to Salsa.  If anyone is considering learning from these DVDs...don't.  You'll not only learn some bad habits in dancing, but you'll be a joke on the dance floor.

The only worth these DVDs have to anyone interested in Salsa is for a good laugh.  Seriously...Amazon should consider removing this product.",1162684800,3,643,4.678571428571429
1713727,1,B000066RHA,"I bought this DVD a while back from Amazon. I was very disappointed with the dvd. It's a joke!,really. He was worse than the beginner dancer. I watched the DVD for about 5 minutes and it made me sick thinking that I paid for this?. I will not accept this if someone give it to me for FREE. If you're serious in learning salsa, the New York Salsa DVD series are very good. Don't waste your money on this one!.",1155772800,7,408,4.1125
1713728,5,B000066RHA,"This is an excellent DVD for those who know very little, or just basic salsa. Unlike the other DVDs I have seen which are not realistic in the instruction, making it impossible for mere mortals to learn, and enjoy salsa, this DVD makes it a lot easier to learn the basics of the real traditional salsa. In South America we also dance salsa, even in Brazil, and this is the way most people dance in Latin America.",1151884800,2,412,4.363636363636363
1713729,1,B000066RHA,"These is beastly, useless DVD. Instructors don't count at all and don't dance to music. They dance only cumbia constantly.  They have no style. Don't buy this video, you will not learn salsa. I think to return these DVD.",1147132800,2,220,4.641025641025641
1713730,1,B000066RHA,"These is beastly, useless DVD. Instructors don't count at all and don't dance to music. They dance only cumbia constantly.  They have no style. Don't buy this video, you will not learn salsa. I think to return these DVD.",1147132800,3,220,4.641025641025641
1713731,2,B000066RHA,"I would not recommend this DVD for Salsa dance beginners who are used to the classic 123-567 lesson style. This DVD is only good for general Latin dance styles, not Salsa specific!",1123200000,7,180,4.65625
1713732,5,B000066RHA,My girlfriend made me buy this video after a night of dancing at the local club. All I can say is that the way Marlon builds steps made it easy for someone who has no coordination like me. Looking forward to getting part II next.,1096848000,12,229,4.111111111111111
1713733,4,B000066RHA,I was worried that learning to salsa dance would be difficult or time consuming. I was wrong. Marlon Silva's building blocks were great. I learned each step then combined for more advanced moves. I liked his attention to detail and energy.,1096416000,6,239,4.853658536585366
1713734,5,B000066RHA,"Let's Dance Salsa is the best DVD for learning salsa dance that I have ever seen. Marlon Silva has lots of energy, which really comes across on-screen. Easy to follow steps and tons of fun. I highly recommend this DVD!",1096329600,8,218,4.475
1713735,5,B000066RHA,I have no experience in dance so I was not sure what to expect when I purchased the Let's Dance Salsa DVD. I was pleasantly surprised. Marlon Silva really breaks down the steps so you can understand them then helps you progress to a more advanced level at your own pace. I've now bought several of the DVDs in the Let's Dance Salsa series and I've never been disappointed. Marlon Silva is the best!,1096329600,7,398,4.391891891891892
7962424,1,B000066RHA,Supposed to be for beginners but it's not. They go way too fast I don't explain anything. Wish I could get my money back,1466899200,,120,4.041666666666667
7962425,5,B000066RHA,Great,1433289600,,5,5.0
7962426,2,B000066RHA,This video starts with assuming that you know the beginner steps.  A lousy start. There was only one dvd in the package!,1360368000,,120,4.454545454545454
7962427,1,B000066RHA,"I'm so glad I didn't pay for this DVD.  It was a waste of time.  I am a total beginner, with no dance experience at all.  It is titled ""Beginning Lessons 1"" and it's not for a total beginner like me.  He goes too quickly through the steps.  I just need someone to show me the steps, one step at a time.  It would have been nice to show the step slowly and then speed it up to the way it's supposed to look.  His lack of teaching was frustrating.  His accent is also difficult to understand.  I need to find a salsa dance instructional DVD for a complete beginner like myself.",1271203200,,575,4.0625
7962428,1,B000066RHA,"...I've loved watching Marlon and Susie many times on the internet for a cheap laugh. They are a testament to the fact that ""there is a fool born every minute"", and ""you can fool SOME of the people ALL of the time""... :^) ...And that if you just act serious, confident and as if you know what you are doing, you can sell people any kind of trash you want!!!

In real life, as someone who lives and breathes Salsa, and has seen a lot of instructors, i know that this couple is a joke! If you start dancing Salsa this way in any Latin club i've visited anywhere in the world, you will be laughed out of it! No self-respecting woman who knows how to dance any style of Salsa - classic, modern, or ballroom - will subject herself to the nonsense that Marlon teaches. You will look like a fool in any Salsa setting...

I love Marlon and Susie because they are the best Salsa clowns. However, buy this only if you have money to burn on a JOKE! :^)",1266710400,,941,4.164835164835165
7962429,1,B000066RHA,"The video is very poorly made, and the instructors look like fools with the dance moves they use.  Complete waste of money. Check out salsa crazy videos or super mario instead.",1259193600,,176,4.67741935483871
7962430,1,B000066RHA,"I can't believe that someone actuallly gave 5 stars for this junk DVD.  I actually bought this DVD a couple of years ago.  I was so...upset when I started watching it.  This guy is actually think that he can teach someone to dance?, what a joke.  I would not buy this DVD if I've known, I won't even take it for FREE. I returned the DVD and got my money back. Please don't waste your money on this.",1202169600,,398,4.064102564102564
7962431,1,B000066RHA,"I borrowed this DVD from a friend and am SO glad I did not pay for this!  Had this been my first look at Salsa it would have been my last.  Marlon has not the least idea how to teach dancing!  This DVD almost sucked the joy of dancing out of me.  ""Anyone Can Dance Salsa"" is a much better choice!",1174348800,3,296,3.80327868852459
7962432,4,B000066RHA,A good palce to start the basics of Salsa Dancing. One of the easiest of rythmic dances to learn you will have lots of fun with this DVD.,1169078400,,137,3.9285714285714284
7962433,3,B000066RHA,I think the tape is adequate.  It gives the elementary step information.  I think the part teaching the turns is very good.,1168300800,2,123,4.545454545454546
