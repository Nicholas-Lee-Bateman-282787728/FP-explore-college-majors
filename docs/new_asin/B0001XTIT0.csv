8018027,1,B0001XTIT0,"First, let me assure you that I am a fan of Freddy going back to 1959 in the Rio Grande Valley, where he was a young and talented
(and slender) local star.

I was thrilled when he overcame all of the many problems and surfaced once again in the 1940's with Before The Next Teamdrop and
so many others.  Loved him with The Texas Tornadoes.

A couple of years ago I went back to San Benito just to visit the
Freddy Fender Museum, which is small, but a wonderful tribute to
a great performer.

That's why this dvd is sad and disappointing.

It was poorly produced, more like home video, and Freddy Fender
deserved more.

The opening is torturous, and I will never again listen to
Eight Days On The Road without grimacing.  It went on forever.

The lighting was awful, the camera changes were abrupt and made
you dizzy

In the same shipment from Amazon, I also received a dvd of
The Texas Tornados and I believe that will showcase Freddy
as he should be shown, an unforgettable voice, gracious performer,
and healthy.",1346457600,3,1013,4.461956521739131
8018028,4,B0001XTIT0,"This lovely lady from Zimbabwe enjoyed a couple of hits which helped shape the future of dance music. Then she caught up in the web of a major label who wanted to make her a soul diva and her career stalled. This collection is a gem which reminds us of what could have been. Rozalla released 3 albums and the best of these albums has been included here, and also a previously unreleased track, the cool Live another life.
Taken from her first album Everybody's free are the famous title track, Faith and Are you ready to fly? These are great dance songs with a message of positivy and hope. Everybody's free reached #37 on billboard but deserved much better. Yes, it is also THAT song which was featured on the Sunscreen song!
Her second album was much weaker but Rozalla picked simply the best. They also come in their European mixes which are more enjoyable. The best thing about this CD are Don't go lose it baby, Rain come down, Sundown and Pride: all tracks from her 3rd album Coming Home and all unavailable in the US until now. The only thing one could have wished for is that Leave it to me was also included; a nice ballad which captures Rozalla at her best.
Best of Rozalla is a fine collection by a great dance artist who deserves more recognition. There's not a bad song on this album.",1081555200,2,1297,4.408333333333333
