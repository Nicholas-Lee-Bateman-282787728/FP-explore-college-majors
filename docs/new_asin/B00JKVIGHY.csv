8652032,5,B00JKVIGHY,"On board the ship from Hong Kong to San Francisco a frail beauty falls in love with a charismatic charmer. She doesnt realize hes a convicted murderer under the watchful eye of the detective on board, and he doesnt realize shes close to death. This is another Pre-Code winner! Its a romantic comedy with a bittersweet twist. Youll laugh, and youll tug at the box of tissues. Dont miss this must see film.",1520467200,,404,4.5479452054794525
