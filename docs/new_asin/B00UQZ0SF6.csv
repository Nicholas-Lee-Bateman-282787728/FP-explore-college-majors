8707914,2,B00UQZ0SF6,"If one is searching for His Truth, this film does not contain it. What this film is, is merely another Pharisaical Talmudic teaching promoting that what is known as the state of Israel today, that this apo""state"" is somehow the re-gathering of Israel back to the land by Christ, our Savior and Deliver, the same Deliverer of Israel from Egypt. If one wants the His Truth and how the disciples of Christ became separated from their Jewish brethren, begin by reading the Birkat ha Minim and then go read the history of the original sect of the Nazarenes. If one wants His Truth, then from the time of the Birkat ha Minim to the time of the Reformation, and to the times of today, read the history of the true disciples who cast off the religious traditions of both Judaism & Roman Christendom, including Catholicism, as Jesus the Christ taught His disciples to do, leading them by example, they followed The Way of their Master only to be persecuted, beheaded, burned at the stake, etc., etc. How the true disciples of Christ taught/teach love, not war and who's heart was/is that of Christ, that all mankind should come to the knowledge of the Gospel & be saved. Jesus said, love thy enemies, do good to those who hating you and do pray for those who are persecuting you. None has been persecuted more than those who have and to this day, do stand with Christ by casting off the burdens of the religions of men. Shalom",1436918400,6,1417,4.5390625
