7089082,3,B00VG3OB3W,I saw this movie in the 80s and I enjoyed it. Its a wonderful movie (with some nonsense in between). So when I saw this movie coming on blu ray in the US I wanted to get it. I got it and I can say it leaves a lot to desire. It has the movie which is wonderful but that's about it. 2.0 Audio 480i picture and no special features at all. I was hoping for me (especially due to the price). I would say unless you are a huge fan of this movie wait until it goes down in price. To me its worth the price (currently $19.99). The bad thing about the audio is that the soundtrack is great. If done better you could really enjoy the music.,1440460800,,630,3.853846153846154
7089083,1,B00VG3OB3W,"Olive films have a shocking reputation of releasing old classics on blu-ray with no special features at all
infact some of their blu-ray's are just DVD transfers with the same Mono sound quality of the DVD
Olive films are insulting new blu-ray reissues for fans, they should be banned taken off the market
cause just as i thought this new blu-ray version of the Last American virgin from 1981
has no new extras at all, has nothing typical barebones just like other Olive films blu-ray versions
and it wouldn't surprise me that the HD transfer is just a DVD transfer
Olive films blu-ray's are shocking, they make no effort at all when it comes to reissuing old classics

so if you love this lost classic from 1981 i strongly recommend buying the U.K. Arrowfilms blu-ray of this film
Arrowfilms do care about the fans of these lost classics
and Arrow films make a big effort to get new special features aswell plus
make an effort with the picture quality of the film
i have a copy of the U.K. blu-ray myself it's a DVD + Blu-ray combo
both DVD & blu-ray have exact same content obviously
the only difference is this the dvd picture is only Digital remaster,
the blu-ray is High Definition transfer-big difference in picture & sound quality
i only watched the blu-ray version, blu-ray is much better quality than dvd
and the picture quality is amazing in 1:85:1 ratio
Arrowfilms really make an effort to clean up the picture quality for sure
very nice sharp & clear picture for sure no Doubt about it
plus the sound quality has been boosted with a new 2.0 stereo mix, not a bad Mono sound mix
much, much better effort than the terrible Olive films blu-ray
plus it does not stop there
Arrowfilms have given new extras, Olive films wouldn't even bother with that
there's new special features, new interviews on the U.K. blu-ray release
new interview with Actress Diane Franklin, very informative interview goes for about 30mins
new interview with Director Boaz Davidson again very informative interview, goes for around 30mins
new interview with the Cinematographer from the film
and new interview with Actor Lawrence Monoson who played the Pizza boy in the film
plus a new collectors booklet about the making of the film
unfortunately the Blu-ray is region B locked, the dvd is region 2 of course
so you need all regions player for either format
but if you love this old classic get the U.K. blu-ray you won't regret it
you can buy it off amazon uk and get it shipped to your U.S. address
the Olive films blu-ray is an insult
4 stars for the film, 1 star for the Olive blu-ray, a big 5 stars for the U.K. Arrowfilms blu-ray",1440374400,26,2619,4.620171673819742

7089099,4,B00VG3OB3W,"Contrary to mass condemnation of this particular Blu-ray title by OliveFilms, I do beg to differ. The defense is based on actual observation, as I do own the DVD version, as well. For purposes of comparison, I played the DVD first & noted the sharpness/resolution in specific areas (signs, faces, buildings, etc.), as well as colour depth, artifacts & of course sound quality. Then I played the Blu-ray & wow; what a difference! The resolution WAS definitely sharper, as could read signs on buildings & on the freeway that I absolutely could NOT read on the DVD iteration. Colours were richer/deeper, too. The sound was far more dynamic, as well.

There are a couple gripes, though. They could have laboured further to reduce the graininess, which is especially evident when pausing, fast-forwarding or rewinding. Also, as most know, the cheap bastards should have included some extras!!!

In short, the Blu-ray is unequivocally a worthy upgrade from DVD but after such a long wait, OliveFilms should have just went the extra distance.",1448668800,14,1035,5.046783625730995

7089105,5,B00VG3OB3W,this movie brings a tear to my eye everytime i watch it.  never saw a  comedy where it completely swithches to a tear jerker until now.  funny movie through the first hour and then the last half hour is a tear jerker. the songs also really match this film great.  the production did a excellent job. i love every minute of this great classic.,1442620800,,342,4.296875

7089108,1,B00VG3OB3W,"Been waiting a long time to get a BR copy of this classic film and what a big disappointment. While the film to BR transfer seems okay, I was really shocked that this package did not include ANY EXTRA'S what so ever? I mean why couldn't a company like Shout Factory put this out instead? All the key players in the film are still with us and would of been nice to hear interviews along with audio commentary tracks ? I hear a UK version has some of these extra's. Do yourself a favor, if you already have a dvd version of this film put out by MGM don't bother spending more money on this crap. Trust me.  As a huge fan of this film, I say stick with that version or buy the UK Blu-Ray.",1441238400,4,685,4.036764705882353
