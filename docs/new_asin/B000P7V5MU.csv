There are some great stretches you won't find anywhere else - normal but also unique hip flexor (and other) stretches, use of other equipment (but you only really need a ball and weights) and a fabulous setting by the lake. The lack of music is actually restful -after a while I can find music irritating - however, if you like the ra ra Hollywood workouts this probably isn't for you. The DVD starts slowly with information about posture, starts off being fairly easy, then quickly ramps up. Denise is no wimp - she manages to smile while performing some really difficult exercises on the ball - but has a good mix of moves that most people can handle with some that challenge. She has been through a major accident and so knows what works remedially firsthand if that is your reason for purchasing. I like the choice of routines available - separate upper and lower body and flexibility workouts with a 30 min workout as well - & a foam roller section - this and flexibility sections are great for runners - very good value overall too. A great, no nonsense approach to fitness. Nice job, Denise!",1244419200,4,1250,4.4868421052631575
8189802,5,B000P7V5MU,"This is the best workout DVD I purchased this year , you get a lot for your money - 150 minutes of workouts. I never liked lower body workouts but I do like the one on this dvd, it really fried my legs with all kinds of exercises like one legged squats with the ball , on the balance disc , lunges , a killer series of bridge work on the ball etc... There are also an Upper body , Core and a 30 minute fix (total body) as well as 3 different stretching segments.
In all of the workouts you don't rest a lot between exercises so your muscles get a good burn, I had major DOMS from all of the workouts.
It utilizes a lot of equipment but she always shows a few variations for every exercise so you can get by with a fitball and weights alone or diversify your workouts everytime if you have more equipment. Highly recommended.",1193529600,7,824,4.092592592592593
8189803,5,B000P7V5MU,"In her 3-DVD Fitness Fix series, Denise Beatty, an exercise physiologist, coach, and personal trainer, has put together excellent functional core stability training exercises, all of which have been approved by physicians, chiropractors, and physical therapists for safety. The Intermediate DVD is intended for those who are/have been recently active; it is also geared to those preparing for or participating in sports. The overall focus is on balance, functional strength, and flexibility.

This versatile DVD utilizes a wide variety of equipment, including a stability ball, a small ball, dumbbells, tubing, a balance disk, an Xco trainer, and a foam roller. However, Denise and her background exerciser, Amy, always show different options; Denise often ups the difficulty level with the balance disk, while Amy shows the more modified version. The Main Menu of the DVD contains the following four options: Introduction (a brief overview by Denise), the Fitness Fix (links to the exercises), Equipment (overview of all equipment used), and Credits.

The Intermediate menu breaks down the exercises into the following two sub-menus:

Exercises
*Balance Warmup Fix - 8 min
*Upper Body Fix - 28 min
*Lower Body Fix - 34 min
*Core Fix - 30 min
*30 Minute Fix

Cool Down
*Upper Body Flexibility - 4 min
*Lower Body Flexibility - 6 min
*Foam Roller Massage - 15 min

The Balance Warm-Up begins with a brief review of six Bs of posture (Base of skull, Breastbone, shoulder Blades, Belly button in, Bottoms up, Breathe) and then moves into some basic warms-up moves such as balance on one foot with arm circles and squats with knee lift and rear kick; there are also a few exercises on the stability ball (roll-outs, bird-dog) and a knee balance on the ball to finish.  Both the upper and the lower body portions contain traditional exercises (eg, bicep curls, triceps kick-backs, squats, lunges), but these moves are made more functional by the addition of a balance element (either the stability ball or balance disk or BOTH) as well as a strong core emphasis.  Denise frequently works the same muscle at different angles; she particularly targets shoulders during the upper body work and provides plenty of great alignment reminders during the lower body portion.  The core segment is largely on the stability ball and includes plenty of plank work; the moves are doable but will REALLY challenge your abs and back, probably more than anything else you've tried.

In the 30 Minute Fix, Denise works out alone, doing compound moves to work the arms and legs at the same time.  After a brief warm-up, she performs exercises such as French press with 1-leg squat and side squat with shoulder work.  This segment uses weights, tubing, and the stability ball; it includes abs work and ends with a quick 3-minute stretch.  (Note: this same series appears on the Advanced DVD as well, but additional exercises are appear in the advanced version).  The Cool Down segments, consisting of flexibility work, are the same on all three Fitness Fix DVDs. The Upper Body Flexibility is performed seated on the stability ball and thoroughly stretches all of the major muscle groups. The Lower Body Flexibility also uses the stability ball; in addition to standard muscle group stretches, it contains moves that uniquely target areas such as the groin, inner thighs, and IT band. Finally, in the Foam Roller Massage segment, Denise leads you through a deep tissue massage for the entire body.

There is no music during this workout--rather, it is more like a one-on-one personal training session with Denise. Her enthusiasm for this work shines throughout the DVD, and she is extremely encouraging and motivating. She and Amy are exercising outdoors against a beautiful lakeside Canadian backdrop with mountains in the distance. Those who have mastered the Fitness Fix Beginner DVD or found it too easy will DEFINITELY be challenged by the Intermediate version, as it's a big step up in difficulty level.  I guarantee that this workout will give you great functional strength and work your core harder than most other exercise programs--highly recommended!",1185408000,20,4137,5.099112426035503
