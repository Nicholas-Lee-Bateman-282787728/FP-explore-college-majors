7982412,5,B00008FNX9,"I am a big fan of Ray Bradbury and have read many of his novels, including The Martian Chronicles.  This video is divided into five stories, most of which came from this same novel.  Bradbury's subtle warnings about the future give the viewer something to think about besides the obvious question ""Is there life on Mars?""  It's a great video for teenagers too.",1062374400,8,360,4.682539682539683
