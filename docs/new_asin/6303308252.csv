629732,3,6303308252,"I liked the movie because it has Myrna Loy. But I am a happy endings sort of person, so I didn't care for the ending. But, over all it is okay to watch.",1197331200,2,152,3.6363636363636362
629733,5,6303308252,"This story just crackles and the cast is spectacular.  There is no extra features to speak of, but the film transfer is very good and the audio is clear.  Myrna Loy enthralls as the conniving and greedy wife who is shielded from society by the veil of marriage, and Ann Harding is endearing and sharp as the loving and supportive artist girlfriend of the always exceptional Leslie Howard.  This story was ahead of its time with the lover holding the moral high ground.  If you love classic movies that swirl with dialogue and character development, then this is for you.  A must-see Pre-Code film.",1191456000,4,597,4.701923076923077
629734,4,6303308252,"The Animal Kingdom features one of the more shocking elements of the pre-code era. It revolves around a man, his former mistress, and his current wife. Leslie Howard plays Tom Collier, a wealthy man whose family wishes he would settle down and be more dignified. He does so with Cecilia (Myrna Loy), a somewhat haughty, controlling woman from high society. However, in order to make his marriage work, his mistress Daisy (Ann Harding) breaks ties with him. He is hurt by the separation and begins to pursue her without realizing his true feelings for her.

The relationships between the characters are very believable and engrossing. It helps that the stars are phenomenal actors. Howard is particularly wonderful. His acting is subtle but charming, intelligent, and powerful. Everything he says seems important and thoughtful, even if he's delivering a casual response. Harding complements him well. Although some of her gestures seem very overt and stereotypical, it is difficult not to believe them to be true. She is entirely genuine and agreeable.",1158192000,6,1052,5.188235294117647
629735,5,6303308252,"The Alpha Version of this Historic film, the first shown on the opening night of Radio City Music Hall, is exceptional, and the best Alpha print I have ever seen.  This is also a smart, intelligent film.  More prints like this one and Millie could give Alpha a better reputation than it currently has.",1156204800,14,301,4.555555555555555
629736,4,6303308252,"Nice one. Leslie Howard is a lot more interesting in this than he ever was as Ashley Wilkes. Perenially sympathetic Myrna Loy is sexy and not so nice. Ann Harding and William Gargan are quite solid. The dialogue is snappy and great. The acting is first rate. The conflict itself doesn't have so much merit. This is rather a shallow and quickly told story about a man choosing depth over surface. But still the movie is a lot more vibrant than some of today's fare, at once a little bit thoughtful and entertaining.",1041379200,21,514,4.537634408602151
629737,4,6303308252,"Philip Barry's very successful stage play was the basis for this well-acted romantic vehicle which should still appeal to the sophisticated and intellectual. Howard plays a rich publisher who leaves his artist-mistress to marry socially active Loy, only to discover that the security of married life doesn't exist: his wife turns out to be a Lorelei who's encouraging an affair with another man (Hamilton)... In an ironic and interesting contrast, Loy acts more like his mistress and Harding is more wife-like. Howard's acting expertise is shown to advantage here, he being caught in a classic triangle and eventually realising just how essentially shallow Loy really is and what a prize he had in Harding. Ann Harding gives her usual sensitively sincere performance and although Myrna Loy was not yet considered star material when she was given the role of Cecilia, she clearly gives a masterful portrayal of the flirtatious vixen. There is a splendidly amusing performance given by William Gargan as Regan the butler: at a party, he pours himself drinks and oafishly makes himself at home, acting as if he belonged among the elite company. It is, however, Howard who carries the film: he was the epitome of the sensitive gentleman in films such as this in the decade of the 1930's.",1031184000,7,1283,5.028169014084507
629738,5,6303308252,"In my opinion, a great film adaptation of Philip Barry's Play, with a luminous performance by grand actress, Ann Harding; Myrna Loy is excellent too, as Leslie Howard's alluring, sensual and manipulative wife; Leslie Howard's good as usual, and all of them get fine support from Neil Hamilton, Ilka Chase, Henry Stephenson, and especially, William Gargan, who is hilarious as a joke of a butler! (he's an ex-fighter). Perhaps it may be regarded as kind of talky and stagy by today's standards, but anyway it's pretty adult stuff with great dialogues and subtleties, and a great example of what could be done with a fine script and cast, before the Production Code was fully enforced in 1934.",1029801600,21,691,4.914529914529915
629838,1,6303308252,"VERY BAD QUALITY copy, by Alpha Video of this wonderful movie. Alpha Video should have made it clear that the buyer would have to accept the poor condition issues, to enjoy this product. Extremely washed out contrast, with ghosted images around the faces of the key actors throughout the movie. My DVD player has no evidence of this during similar era black & white movies. Very jittery on-screen display. Looks like they played a film copy, and setup a digital camera to record the image from the film movie screen. This is unfortunate because the story, acting, & overall film, is worth preserving. I would have paid more for an even slightly preserved copy.",1329350400,6,660,4.798245614035087
629839,5,6303308252,"The Animal Kingdom is an intelligent and witty film about the complexities of human relationships, written by famous playwrite Philip Barry, who also wrote personal favorites Holiday and The Philadelphia Story. Wealthy Tom Collier is living with his Bohemian girlfriend, Daisy Sage. He starts a publishing company that focuses on avant-garde works popular with his friends. When pressured by his family to marry, he does not choose Daisy, but the more proper wife material, Cecilia Henry. But the wife he has doesn't prove to be the wife he wants. Cecelia is typically conventional, and insists that Tom publish books that will sell and make money. She dislikes Red Regan, a friend and former boxer whom Tom has hired as a butler, and wants him fired, as he doesn't fit in with her snobbish ideals of society style servants. (His drunken behavior at one of her society bashes may have influenced her dislike!) Tom becomes restless with his ill-fitting lifestyle and approaches Daisy to resume their unconventional relationship. This film was made Pre-code, and thank goodness for that, as this film is quite frank, not only its subject, but in the open dialogue. Cecelia withholds sex to get what she wants, and Tom thinks her decorating style is similar to a brothel he once visited. The story contrasts the selfish, conventional attitudes of the haves against the idealistic and more carefree beliefs of the have-nots, and clearly finds the have-nots the better people. (Speaking as one of the have-nots, that's my interpretation, and I'm sticking to it!) The cast in this film is one of the best assembled for any film. Howard played the role on Broadway, so clearly he knows this character inside and out. Collier is completely different from the idealistic dreamer character Howard was typecast with later in his career, and he manages to fully capture the essence of the carefree playboy turned conventional husband who slowly realizes he has made a very serious mistake in judgment. Ann Harding is wonderful as the Pre-Hippie Daisy Sage. She is one of my favorite actresses, and this film features one of  her best performances. The surprise is Myrna Loy, who later became famous as The Perfect Wife, the character she typically played (especially in the Thin Man series). But this is not that! Cecelia is selfish, manipulative, and sometimes quite cruel, but she is one of the most interesting characters in the story. Like Holiday and The Philadelphia Story, the script sparkles with wit and charm, and the characters use and twist the language into clever bon mots, the way we normal people only dream of talking. (Daisy: [on Collier's wedding day] ""A foolish virgin, me. Oh, foolish anyway."") Surprisingly, although the play was quite successful, the movie version never found its proper audience. That's a pity, because it is a brilliant piece of work, every bit as fun and entertaining as Barry's better known plays.",1329350400,4,2929,5.026748971193416
629840,3,6303308252,"While it seems a bit high-brow, the actors do an excellent job, and the ladies costumes alone make it worth watching.  Good, adult entertainment.",1287619200,,145,5.041666666666667
629841,2,6303308252,"...but viewing this DVD is horrible.  I bought this with some trepidation since it an Alpha studio copy and they are not exactly known for their high quality transfers (IMO) but unfortunately they seem like the only game in town when trying to get these older movies on DVD.  Going by some of the other reviews in here saying it is the best Alpha transfer they'd seen, I bought this DVD. The story is top notch.  No problem. But I expected more quality than what's on this DVD. Highlights were very washed out to the point where you could hardly distinguish the faces so don't expect even a good transfer with this DVD.  Mediocre maybe.  Unless I happened to get a really poorly manufactured DVD i couldn't rate this any higher (and that's only due to the story).",1267056000,10,763,4.5

629843,5,6303308252,"This almost forgotten film is a must-see for the wonderful and subtle performances of Leslie Howard (one of his best ever) and the underrated Ann Harding (she has top billing!) -- and Myrna Loy shows that she can be convincing in an unsympathetic role. Leni Stengel is so good in a small role that I wanted to see more of her, and Ilka Chase is hilarious as a hanger-on.

The screenplay is written by and for adults -- little is stated outright, much is implied. I've seen this several times on late night TV, and I've never tired of it. I'm glad I now own the Alpha DVD, which is very good for a 1932 film.

Note: the check Leslie Howard receives from his father is for $100,000 -- you can just make out the amount when Howard puts it on the mantel. That's equivalent to more than $1.5 million in today's money!",1244505600,2,812,4.300653594771242
629844,5,6303308252,"The Animal Kingdom sports some mighty terrific acting by a wonderful cast. The plot of this pre-code drama moves along at a very good pace; it could have been edited just a little but this is very minor. The cinematography is very well done throughout the film; and the choreography works best in crowded scenes including the surprise birthday party. There are two very minor disappointments: The quality of the print could have been a little bit better; and once or twice there was the very obvious and distinctly different noises of the two cameras that were rolling when a scene involved two people talking.

When the action starts, we quickly meet the somewhat bohemian Tom Collier (Leslie Howard) who happily owns and runs The Bantam Press, a small independent publishing company. He lives with his girlfriend Daisy Sage (Ann Harding); Tom and Daisy snub the conventional wisdom of the time that a man and a woman had to be married before they could live together. Tom's father Rufus Collier (Henry Stephenson) has nothing but disdain for Tom's lifestyle; but it is the pretty society girl Cecilia ""Cee"" Henry (Myrna Loy) who steals Tom from Daisy when Daisy is away for a while. In fact, as the picture begins, Daisy is sailing into New York harbor that night only to find out that Tom, who she still thinks is her man, will be marrying ""Cee"" very soon.

Daisy certainly does take it very badly, although she admits along with Tom that they never had any real strings attached to their relationship. Tom still wants to be friends with Daisy and see her from time to time; but Daisy angrily refuses and Tom leaves without even taking his belongings. After Tom marries ""Cee,"" he never sees his old friends anymore; his quirky butler and friend ""Red"" Regan (William Gargan) stays on--but only for a while. ""Red"" can't take the stuffiness of life in Connecticut with ""Cee"" and Tom so he leaves just as ""Cee"" has convinced Tom to fire him anyway.

Tom eventually simply shows up at Daisy's Manhattan apartment and they quickly rekindle their friendship--and their old flame, too. Tom doesn't tell all of this to ""Cee;"" but ""Cee"" decides to test how everything is going  by throwing a surprise birthday party for Tom--and ""Cee"" makes sure to invite Daisy as well as Tom's old friends ""Franc"" Schmidt (Leni Stengel) and Joe Fiske (Don Dillaway).

What happens at that party? ""Cee"" has also invited a man who has not so secretly wanted her for a long time, a fellow named Owen (Neil Hamilton)--how will he figure into all this? Will ""Cee"" and Daisy get along that night? What will happen if ""Red"" has trouble on his new job and wants to return to his old job working for Tom and ""Cee?"" Watch and find out!

The DVD comes with nothing in the way of extras except scene selection; but with these budget DVDs that's the way it goes, I guess.

The Animal Kingdom showcases the fabulous talents of Leslie Howard, Ann Harding and Myrna Loy. Look for a wonderful performance by William Gargan as ""Red"" the butler, too. Most if not all of the plot could even take place in these times so the film remains relevant despite the passage of time. I highly recommend this film for classic movie buffs; and of course people who are fans of the actors in this movie will want this DVD as well.",1238976000,8,3276,4.637931034482759
629845,4,6303308252,"Alpha's release of this early pre-code RKO classic is definitely above average compared with their other releases. But that's not to say the source material is anything spectacular, either.

My only complaints are the lack of contrast (the faces of Myrna Loy and Ann Harding often look washed out and over-lit), and the fact that Alpha always chops off the studio logos at the beginning of their pictures.  Other than those two things, I suppose I'm content with this DVD until at some point Time Warner releases it under their own banner using the original film elements as the source material.

Well worth the purchase if the price is less than 7 or 8 bucks.",1238630400,3,660,4.721739130434782
629846,3,6303308252,"Stodgy is the best word to describe this classic starring Leslie Howard with Myrna Loy in a supporting role. There is little comedic action and what is intended as such has not improved with age. Based on a stage play by Philip Barry who later wrote The Philadelphia Story, this screenplay has been eclipsed by the decline and fall of morals and marriage, which makes the alleged wanton behavior seem trite and ponderous.

The source print used by Alpha is far better than the usual used by Alpha. Although it is clean with only a couple of missing frames, it is soft and the contrast is thin, which means some scenes are washed out, so to speak.

When released during 1932, this pre-code film produced by David Selznick,  was a shocker due to it's blunt and realistic portrayal of romance and marriages of convenience. But, what was schocking during 1932, is common today and therefore the drama now seems trivial. Historically it is interesting but the entertainment quotient is average at best.",1219622400,,997,4.784883720930233
629847,4,6303308252,"We expected a much lighter-weight movie than this turned out to be--Leslie Howard plays a wealthy young man with a sort of free-love relationship with an independent artist, but while the artist is out of town he falls for Myrna Loy and decides to marry her.  The movie is surprisingly frank about the complexities of these relationships, including sexual complexities, and the end is MOST unusual when you are used to Hollywood endings.

Worth seeing for excellent dialogue, performances, etc., but not least the unusual details of the plot, and also seeing (very young) Myrna Loy in a less-than-sympathetic role.",1209340800,2,614,5.13

7844203,4,6303308252,"This star-studded movie is based on Broadway show entitled ""The woman of his house"" stars Leslie Howard as the Tom Collier who does the mistake of marrying a socialite (Myrna Loy) rather than the woman he really loves (Ann Harding). Very soon he gets bored with friends and the social atmosphere.  His wife begins to dislike the butler (William Gargan) her husband hired; he happens to be an old friend of Tom, and the butler's behavior with the guests is undesirable and sometimes annoying. When the relationship turns sour, Tom retreats to the arms of his real love (Ann Harding).

The work of director Edward Griffith was tasteful in handling the delicate matter of marital infidelity, and movie critics lauded his efforts. But at the height of great depression, this 1932 movie did not generate enough enthusiasm about the infantile problems of wealthy and spoiled. The movie went on make a loss of $110, 000 which was a lot of money at that time, and borrowing Myrna Loy from MGM turned to be very costly for the RKO Studio. Overall, this is still an interesting pre-code film to watch and I recommend this to all fans of pre-code films.",1418083200,,1142,4.733668341708543

The plot is fairly simple. Howard gets engaged to Loy a month after they met and he breaks off with longtime girlfriend Harding. He comes to regret the marriage and passage into high society and misses a previous Bohemian lifestyle where no one manipulated or demanded things of him. Also, Loy's snooty friends aren't to his liking and she can't stand Howard's best pal, a working class ex-boxer who's his butler.

It's not hard to figure out how this very adult story ends.

One moment that surprises is when Howard visits Harding intending to announce his engagement. The timing's awful, for she's got babies on her mind and proposes marriage, even if it's only long enough to conceive a child. That way their offspring wouldn't be stigmatized. Wow, what year was this?

TRIVIA
Kate Hepburn was considered for Loy's role.

Howard, Gargan and Chase originated their roles on Broadway. The play had a 183 performance run.

Although fairly liked now, this film was a box office disaster for Selznick.
It lost $110,000, a monstrous sum by today's standards.",1396396800,,3197,9.428104575163399
