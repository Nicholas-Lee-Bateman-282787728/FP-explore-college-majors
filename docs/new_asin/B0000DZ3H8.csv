8001455,5,B0000DZ3H8,"Produced in 1984 (perhaps it was originally for television) and released by the Bolshoi this is actually a really good production by the Kirov.  There is no deception here at all.  The cover, booklet and titles make it very clear that this is the Kirov. A little like buying Stomil tyres from a Ceat dealer. The cast is all well known from the Kirov, and includes the children from Vaganova Coreographic Institute and Victor Fedotov conducting the Leningrad Theatre of Opera and Ballet. I suspect that it has been 'enhanced' to fit a wider screen, if not there are some problems with the equipment. There is really nothing at all wrong with the performance.  It was danced to be filmed and that allows some liberties in transitions. It has excellent sound, if excellent by TV standards. I would highly recommend owning this, even as part of a collection.  That said, I still hold that the best performance I have ever seen of this was a Bolshoi performance in 1961, but although filmed it has never been restored and the quality of sound and quality of the image look like it was never actually remastered at all (worse, in that case by stretching the image in making the DVD all of the dancers end up short and fat - which they were not).  This Bolshoi/Kirov production is good enough so you can change the format settings on your tele and see a really glorious adaptation.  Also, I find that children like this performance best of those I have (and children can be brutal but honest). A great deal of what works in this performance is due to Victor Fedotov's true understanding of the music and the dance.",1335744000,4,1607,4.601398601398602
8001456,1,B0000DZ3H8,"I ask this because it was so horrible that I couldn't finish watching it and tried to not once but twice! I got through the first 40 minutes and there was more acting than there was dancing. the performance was filmed for TV, and done at weird angles. The characters were almost scary in there clown makeup and the little bit of dancing there was was mediocre at best. The part of cinderella was done by a dancer who looked almost past her prime and again there was more ""acting"" than dancing. I use the word acting loosely. I got this from Netflix, so I'm glad I didn't waste my money on this horrific version of cinderella.

Personally, I like my ballets to be in front of an audience without any ""special effects"" added for TV viewing and I like my ballerinas to actually dance, not go around pinching Cinderella the first 1/2 of the production. If you want to be sure for yourself, rent it first before you buy. You will disappointed if you waste your money on this.",1169337600,8,970,4.388888888888889
8001457,3,B0000DZ3H8,"Amazon's description of this DVD is ""Prokofiev - Cinderella / Komleva, Daoukaev, Galinskaja, Koul, Bolshoi Ballet (1978).""  This is an incorrect attribution.  As many other reviewers have pointed out, it's actually a Kirov production.  The confusion arises because the DVD is issued on the ""Bolshoi"" LABEL, which reads ""Bolshoi presents Sergei Prokofiev -- Cinderella,"" and identifies the disc as ""vol. 02.""  The U.S. distributor is Universal.  So far as I've been able to tell, the only other DVD issued on this label was ""The Nutcracker,"" as ""vol. 01.""

There is nothing to indicate whether the performance may have been filmed in either Leningrad or Moscow.  This is not a bad DVD, but it's not particularly good.  I was as disappointed in the orchestral conducting as in any other aspect of the performance, staging, film direction, or transfer quality.  The best ""Cinderella"" that I'm aware of, in all respects, is the Paris Opera Ballet version choreographed by Rudolf Nureyev, who has reset the story in 1920s Hollywood, and starring Sylvie Guillem.  Unfortunately this production has never been transferred to DVD; the VHS appears to be ASIN: B000005IUP.",1154563200,9,1985,5.62751677852349
8001458,1,B0000DZ3H8,"This is junk. It looks like someone camcorded it off of a television, copied it 1,000 times and then transferred it to a DVD. It would be one thing if it sold for $3.00, but it doesn't. The recorded sound actually isn't bad, but the acting is so absurd you laugh.",1122336000,3,263,4.176470588235294
8001459,5,B0000DZ3H8,"This is one outstanding production!  I usually don't like to comment on other reviews but this is ridiculous!  There is no error in the packaging!  This was a Bolshoi THEATER production, not a Bolshoi Ballet production.  Everthing is correctly identified as the Kirov Ballet performing at the Bolshoi Theater, which is where they always perform when they are in MOSCOW!  They are not confined to Leningrad!  It appears to be made for TV, so they probably made use of the superior Moscow facilities.  It is quite common for some special effects to be used in a ballet like this.  Enough about the packaging.  The performance is outstanding as is the picture quality.  The sound quality is not perfect, however, but acceptable.  The choreography is extremely ambitious and marvelously executed.  Especially noteworthy is the treatment of the ugly sisters; they are not ugly at all and danced on pointe with a large number of solos.  They almost steal the show!  The camera work is also excellent.  If you enjoy aggressive ballet, you'll like this.",1106352000,19,1045,4.959537572254336
8001460,2,B0000DZ3H8,"First, this is indeed a Kirov production so why the front cover says Bolshoi is weird. It is not filmed in front of an audience and someone thought to ""enhance"" the performance with special effects which are awful. They distract from the dance and are very irritating. The performances aren't that good overall and the whole thing is not up to Kirov standards.",1091750400,6,360,4.73015873015873
