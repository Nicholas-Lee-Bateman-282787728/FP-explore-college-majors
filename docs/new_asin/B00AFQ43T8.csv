8551029,5,B00AFQ43T8,PAL requires a special DVD which we had to buy for $40.  This copy doesn't have all the scenes. We noticed that the Youtube version has more scenes.  But when we want to watch it on our TV until we update our technology this will do.  The show itself is really funny.  Bi Rain plays a guy whose bark is loud ....but we don't want to give away the story.  Song Hye-kyo  is just WONDERFUL.  She makes us laugh so much.  They both do and the support actors and story lines are fun too.  Great escapism - we have watched this three times.  FUN.,1450224000,,540,4.105769230769231
8551030,5,B00AFQ43T8,"I, concurred with other reviewer.
Add to the revers's comments, cast was well put together. Imagination of story plots were well organized to the end.
Subtitles were very good (only a slight missed spellings but undetected by most, I'm sure).
I may say one more thing, great packaging, too.",1397865600,2,290,4.938775510204081
8551031,5,B00AFQ43T8,"Innocent Han Ji Eun, a writer, lives in a beautiful house called, ""Full House."" A house full of love and family. The name ""Full House"" was given by her late father. But Han Ji Eun is swindled by her best friends and loses her cherished home. Because of her friends betrayal she is stranded in China, while they sell her house.

On the airplane and in China, she runs into the self-centered actor, Lee Young Jae and they don't quite hit it off with each other due to a few awkward incidents. But thanks to the actor, she is able to return to Korea. However, she soon finds out that he is the one that bought her home.

Ji Eun and Young Jae continue to run into each other. For different personal reasons, they wind up in a one-year marriage contract. But as these two live together and argue consistently, they start to develop feelings for each other.

This is a great and popular romantic comedy. It was a hit drama in 2004. There are lots of funny, endearing, and romantic moments throughout the show. I recommend watching this drama. (16 episodes)",1388448000,3,1050,4.458333333333333
