8525999,5,B0087GKIHY,"After three momentous seasons there is still crime to be solved on the beautiful streets and environs of San Francisco.  And who better to sort out the issues than Mike Stone and Steve Keller played by one of the best teams ever, Karl Malden and Michael Douglas.  May not be considered the greatest crime series ever but with these two charismatic stars, the scenery of the Bay City, a terrific array of guest stars and the qualities of the Quinn Martin producing team, this series, even after countless viewings, will always be one of my favourite television highlights.",1416009600,,571,4.816326530612245
