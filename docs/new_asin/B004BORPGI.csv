4319926,5,B004BORPGI,"Wow, this DVD really helps you understand what is going on with the bees today and how we can help.  I had thought about starting a hive and Organic Beekeeping 101 makes it really easy to get started.  And the photography is beautiful, really shows you fabulous footage.  I highly recommend for anyone who wants to learn about bees or beekeeping!",1291507200,13,346,4.639344262295082
4319927,5,B004BORPGI,"Randy Sue and Paul have created a much needed, lovely, and detailed account for the beginning beekeeper in this long awaited film.  Randy deftly builds hives from top to bottom, describes and demonstrates collecting a swarm and managing a hive from beginning to sweet, sweet end, all the while professing her deep love of these magical creatures. I particluarly appreciate the information about colony collapse disorder, a mysterious syndrome that is decimating bee populations around the world. It't time for more backyard beekeepers!  This is truly an educational delight.  Now I know what to give for Christmas!",1291507200,18,614,5.309278350515464

4319931,5,B004BORPGI,"She does it right and her love and respect for the bees shines through in every thing she does.. She is Very careful with the removal of feral bees.  One lady I can respect and learn from!  Such a lift after watching the fiasco of ""Bee People""... They should go with her on a bee removal trip.  It would do them good.  I will start my hives from HER knowledge.",1418342400,,360,4.1

4319935,5,B004BORPGI,"If your want to start beekeeping, this is the DVD to get.  I had been reading books about beekeeping for quite some time, but they seemed to complicate it.  So, I kept putting it off.  Then I read about the Organic Beekeeping DVD and decided to purchase it.  After watching it I gained the confidence to get started.  Her instruction is wonderful.  I was also able to e-mali her a question regarding beekeeping and she answered promptly!  Thank you Randy Sue!",1399161600,,459,4.592592592592593
4319936,5,B004BORPGI,"Fair amount of info and really gives a feel for raising bees.
However should be paired with a more detailed manual.",1398038400,,115,4.523809523809524
4319937,3,B004BORPGI,Nice little introduction video on bee keeping but no information on keeping Organic bees and NO information on recognizing or treating bee diseases.,1397606400,2,148,5.478260869565218
4319938,4,B004BORPGI,"We have had a local bee keeper place his hives on our property.  We have been so curious...what's going on in there?  This DVD explained so much about the bees and about the process.  While we don't intend to become bee keepers ourselves, we certainly could with the information in the DVD.  This woman really knows her stuff, and it is explained in a straightforward fashion that is easy to follow.",1394582400,,399,4.577464788732394
4319939,5,B004BORPGI,"I love the DVD and have taken heart that there might be a better way to raise bees. After a long and very helpful conversation on the phone with Randy Sue herself, I understand that part of the reason that my hive has died each year is not that they has gotten infected with anything, (I actually think they died from cold exposure or some queen event) but that they were package bees raised in Georgia. I am in NY and Randy highly recommended using a local swarm from my local beekeeping association, as in her experience, local bees are adapted to local weather conditions and are likely to be more weather hardy as a result. She also recommended and sent me the recipe for ""bee tea"", a way to feed bees organically without sugar and using herbs to fortify the mixture. I discussed all this with my beekeeping teacher who is interested to learn more and watch the DVD himself. He himself started with all local swarms and had excellent luck for many years as a professional beekeeper and teacher, but has suffered devastating losses recently of 50% of his hives.  I will try acquiring a local swarm and using the bee tea instead of white sugar. I thank Randy Sue for her generosity with her time and her offer to be a bee mentor if problems arise. I will try a hex hive and the three-sided frame technique in hopes of better luck. I will keep everyone posted! Many thanks for the encouragement to follow my own instincts and here's hoping it works better than the last two years....  Risa Gold",1390694400,,1495,4.472527472527473
4319940,4,B004BORPGI,"This is a professionally presented dvd advocating organic bee keeping. It is interesting that she uses conventional box hives, unlike many who have opted for top bar hives. Also she uses a strip of wax in the frames to start them off in the right direction which seems very sensible. The same dimension boxes are used in the hive for supers and brood chamber which is useful. However I was puzzled by her method of allowing the bees to draw very deep unsupported combs from the second box right down into the first box, which I would presume make for very unweildy combs which might break if bent slightly upwards for examination. I think you could get round this by putting in a wood dowl pin or support in the centre of the brood frames at right angles to the frame. This dvd is enjoyable and worth viewing but I think would merit going a little further into the second and maybe third year of bee keeping but I accept it is for the beginner. However the beginner is going to be faced with some difficult very deep brood combs.",1389398400,,1029,4.421052631578948
4319941,5,B004BORPGI,"I have a 4-H beekeeping project and rely on this video to help my members learn about beekeeping.  Randy Sue's video is wonderfully written, well organized and offers lots of important information in chapters that are easy for the children AND adults to view.  We sometimes only do a chapter or two at a meeting depending on where we are in in project.  We have since started our hive which is happy and healthy and look forward to starting our second hive this spring.  I would HIGHLY recommend this video to anyone interesting in staring a hive or even just learning about beekeeping.",1381017600,,586,4.660194174757281
4319942,5,B004BORPGI,Very informative - we knew nothing about starting a hive going into this and it really gives you everything you need to know.  Definitely looks doable.,1374537600,,151,4.8076923076923075
4319943,5,B004BORPGI,i loved this video....she makes it look fun and exciting....can't wait to start !....Here in Missouri we're big honey eaters as Alot of us are Homesteaders and bee leave (ha) in organic farming !....i emailed with questions and she got RIGHT BACK with me with answers to all my questions....She's a Keeper...!...Thanks so much Randy Sue...,1373328000,,339,5.071428571428571
4319944,5,B004BORPGI,I bought this DID for my husband. We are just getting into bred. We drive a truck and had DID shipped to an operating center so we would be assured of getting it quickly. We did and within 30 minutes of getting it he had it on the laptop and audio hooked into the radio. We both learned a lot. I emailed a further question to the creator and she responded within hours.,1365379200,,369,4.068493150684931
4319945,3,B004BORPGI,"I watched the video, it is interesting, and it is informative, but as far as organic, no. I beleive I heard the word organic once, and it was in the context of I like an organic hive, or something of that nature. The title should be changed to Beekeeping 101 and get rid of the organic. If you are looking for organic or natural beekeeping information, this video is not for you.
I do have to say, I would like to know how she lifts a three sided frame full of comb out of the hive in the heat of summer?",1364342400,,504,4.0
4319946,5,B004BORPGI,"This video TOTALLY inspired my six year olds.  They ask to watch it over and over and are now so excited about keeping bees, while before they were  a bit wary of them.  They are now acting out role playing games where they are the honey bees living in their hives (tents of furniture and sheets) and I am supposed to be Randy Sue (the woman presenting this film) tending to them and taking care of the hive.  The video makes it easy for even a six year old to totally grasp the basic concepts of beekeeping.  After reading Beekeeping for Dummies and attending a beekeepers association meeting for beginning beekeepers, it was really this film that finally made everything clear to me.  Randy Sue attempts to keep the bees as happy as possible, allowing them a more natural existence, using techniques I had not considered or even heard of before.  This video is a must for any beginning beekeeper.  Now excuse me while I go back to pretending that I am Randy Sue.  Got to tend to those six year old bees under the dining room table!",1359331200,,1033,4.452127659574468
4319947,4,B004BORPGI,"This was a Christmas gift for my daughter, who has turned into a domesticated wife and mother going back to her roots.  She was excited, so I guess it was a success.",1357084800,,165,4.15625
4319948,5,B004BORPGI,"This video is GREAT for somebody who is looking into beekeeping for the first time.  I've wanted to do this for years but was just too intimidated by it all.  Randy made it look so easy!  Her smile is beautiful and I just wanted to jump in there with her and watch her while she put together those beehives.  It's very obvious that she loves this.
Just buy it...and get busy with those bees!!!",1318464000,27,393,4.27027027027027
4319949,4,B004BORPGI,Helpful video - simple instructions and clear scenes help clarify what exactly is to be done. Video arrived promptly and was in excellent shape.,1314662400,12,144,5.041666666666667
4319950,2,B004BORPGI,"I'll get this out at the start: although this DVD is professionally made, there is virtually NOTHING in it about ""organic"" beekeeping. The only thing ""organic"" about what the creators have done in this DVD is to OMIT mention of the use of antibiotics, chemicals, and artificial feeding. This DVD is well made, and very professional, but should be simply titled ""Beekeeping 101"" and left at that. I'll not even mention that there really is no such thing as ""organic"" beekeeping, since no one can stop the bees from foraging in sprayed crops; they definitely bring back pesticide residue in the nectar and the wax they create. The more appropriate term for what the DVD is trying to espouse is ""natural beekeeping"".

No mention is made of the varroa mite, small hive beetles, nosema, or wax moths. No mention is made of the ""traditional"" chemical controls, and why they should not be used. Although the author does say she does not artificially feed bees, nor use chemicals, she doesn't say why. She uses a screened bottom board, but doesn't tell you why it's so important! I know that the approach is simply to let the bees do as they please, and yes, this in basically the premise of natural beekeeping, but the author has to assume the viewer has read all kinds of nonsense about using chemicals and feed.

What IS interesting, is the author's use of two medium brood boxes and three-sided medium frames (no bottom rail) with only a foundation starter strip to allow the bees to build their brood comb long and deep into the two boxes. This is actually an interesting idea, and I can see how it would make for better brood patterns. I am going to try it. On the downside, she doesn't address the added risk of this long comb breaking apart during inspection (the frame cannot be turned fully flat), nor the added effort of having to move these frames in two boxes rather than one (if the boxes slide apart the comb will be split).

It's a simple DVD, and if you know a bit about beekeeping, you're not likely to learn anything new (aside from the deep brood comb idea).",1310601600,13,2070,4.589189189189189
4319951,5,B004BORPGI,This DVD provided clear descriptions and visuals of the steps and equipment needed to start up a hive of your own.  I found it facinating to learn more about bees and what is involved in creating a good home for them.  Collecting swarms and providing a habitat for them is so much more sensible than calling a pest control company to destroy the colony.  This DVD showed how easy it is to provide a place for bees in our increasingly urban/suburban areas so we can have these wonderful pollinators in our communities.,1301011200,20,517,4.5978260869565215
4319952,5,B004BORPGI,"Randy's passion, knowledge, and organized approach make this DVD a wonderful asset!  Excellent photography and clear explanations provide a wonderful introduction and inspire confidence!  Thanks for creating this.",1300924800,20,213,6.571428571428571
4319953,5,B004BORPGI,"I have been interested in joining the beekeeping profession for some time now.  I read many books but did not have a clear picture of what it really took to get started and continue forward until I watched this DVD.  This DVD accomplished what hours of reading could not.  As they say ""a picture is worth a thousand words"" and for a starting beekeeper this is absolutely true.  Thank you to Randy Sue and team for really getting me started beekeeping with this video.",1299715200,28,467,4.523809523809524
4319954,2,B004BORPGI,"This was a well-made DVD but not at all what the description described it as. Not one mention about organic pest control, which is what most people are looking for.
This DVD is swarm collection, and using a foundationless hive setup, that is it. Nothing about buying packages or how to deal with hive beetles,varroa mites or any other diseases or pests.
They did however send me a replaced DVD because they changed their minds on some of the things they were teaching. That was very nice. I already knew that her hive body frame movement, into a honey super was not a good idea but that is because I am a beekeeper and understand about bees already. I feel sorry for any new beekeepers who bought this and did what she said and never got the new DVD version because they will be stuck with a triple hive body and there is no way to inspect a huge natural wax comb without breaking it. We are talking about an almost 3' natural comb. You don't even get that with a Top Bar. The other correction that was in the new DVD was that they don't want you to use motor oil (yes motor oil) in your ant motes because it's toxic to the environment. That is NOT organic.
She does have an interesting idea on how to save money by not using foundation but if you want extracted honey this naturally drawn comb foundationless set up will not work in an extractor.
On a more positive point of view. I agree that bees like their own comb vs. foundation and I agree with leaving the hive body alone but there are times when you need to take a peek and make sure your queen is okay and to check her brood pattern. Queens do fail and sometimes bees have a hard time replacing her if they need to and if you are not an inexperienced beekeeper this set up will be hard. It is fun to have natural comb but management still needs to be done. Who cares about losing a swarm buts it is no fun losing a package you paid $68-$99 for.
So may overall rating, knowing what I know now about this DVD is, don't bother with it. It's a waste of money. You can find information like this on the internet and it won't cost you a thing.",1299456000,22,2097,4.205955334987593
4319955,1,B004BORPGI,"The video is pretty well done, no doubt I learned a few tricks watching this DVD, but the host fails to mention any of the pests or diseases that can and will destroy a colony. I was hoping to learn about organic integrated pest control managment, but it was never mentioned. She got close to saying that you don't want to give bees too much space because of wax mothes, but instead cut herself short as not to open that discussion. The problem with this DVD is that it is going to give new beekeepers a false sense of security. If hives are not treated for Varroa Mites in the United States whether organic or otherwise, the colony is going to take a serious hit.

""Without question, varroa mites are the most vexing problem for beekeepers, not only in the United States, but in the rest of the world. If left unchecked, varroa mites will almost assuredly will kill your bee colony."" Dr. Jamie Ellis, University of Florida [...]

I just hate to think of someone getting a colony and having their bees die because they are uninformed about the pests that will kill bees. Again, to not use chemicals should be everyone's goal -- that is why I bought this DVD, I just wanted to know how to control pests organically. Unfortunatly, this DVD never mentions these problems. Check out&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beekeeping-For-Dummies/dp/0470430656/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beekeeping For Dummies</a>&nbsp;-- they have a lot of info on mothes, mites, nosema, American and European foulbrood and other pests and diseases that will kill your colony. You can google varroa mites and see for yourself how awful they are.

She did a good job of showing the inside of the hive and how to catch a swarm, that which I thought was the most interesting.
The University of Florida has a wide variety of free beekeeping pest control videos online that are certainly worth watching. [...]",1298764800,23,1919,4.990625
4319956,5,B004BORPGI,"This is an easy to understand and follow DVD on organic beekeeping.

4319957,5,B004BORPGI,I've always wanted to try beekeeping but had many reservations.  After watching this very informative DVD I'm sure I can be successful at beekeeping.  Thanks!,1295827200,22,158,5.28
4319958,5,B004BORPGI,"This video was charming, informative and professionally done.  It would be very appropriate in a school science class, environmentalist or agriculturalist library, or for anyone who enjoys science made intelligently entertaining. It is a very timely video, beautifully encouraging the average ""Joe"" to have his or her own hive at a time when hives are disappearing and small time hive keeping is really catching on.  Excellent practical information on how to actually get a hive going.  It is keepers like Randy Sue (the star of the video) who may hold the key to the future of bees in north america.  Great Job!  All that is missing is a national registry of beekeepers willing to help you get bees.  Is that out there?",1292284800,22,720,4.860655737704918

First of all, thank you so much. I have learned a lot from this DVD.
I have watched a lot of YouTube also, some were helpful, but I saw some of the beekeepers on YouTube failed,
and I was able to find out what was their mistake because of your instructions.
So thanks again, its really a great DVD.",1502323200,,349,4.147058823529412
8422133,4,B004BORPGI,"Good general DVD on beginning beekeeping. A bit overdone on the suiting up, unless you run a lot of AHB. As with all ""beginner"" beekeeping videos and books, there are some misconceptions that keep getting spread through the community. Would not recommend 3 sided frames for beginning beekeepers. The frame assembly and construction process could use a LOT of modification to make it easier. Good info on hive stand construction, but I would avoid the ""pans"" under the legs.

8422138,2,B004BORPGI,"This is great if you want your 8 year old to learn about bee keeping. It is very basic and offers very little. Maybe good for someone who has never seen or been around a bee hive. Most of the Video was drawn out with elementary stuff. I couldn't stand that they would not do a better job editing this DVD. For example I watched her hammer each and every little nail to assemble a hive frame. Nobody need to watch this lady hammer little nails in real time. Save yourself time and fast forward over her slow pace. Also not much in the way of her ""organic beekeeping"". I realized how silly and elementary this was when my kids who have only been doing bee keeping with me for a month (ages 8 & 10) said that they didn't learn anything from the video they didn't already know or understand. Don't waste the money on this there are way better DVD's that aren't taught by preschool teacher.",1436572800,2,885,4.273809523809524
