2406343,5,B000B837XS,"Mash is a show that almost anyone who has seen either first run or in syndication loves. I remember watching it with my parents till I got a job that forced me to miss the last 3 years of MASH and that was pre VCR.

 I have enjoyed watching it on FOX networks but I know I was missing something. I have every season on DVD so far and will order the 9th,10,and the final 11th season when they are available.

 Every season of MASH is my favorite.

I have one wish ,for someone to release the songs Col. Potter and the gang sang on the show.",1130544000,11,539,4.0
2406344,5,B000B837XS,"THIS SEASON REPRESENTS WHAT I BELIEVE WAS THEIR BEST SEASON,PERHAPS A LITTLE MORE MATURE.I ENJOYED EVERY EPISODE FROM DAY ONE.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SET 5 STAR RATING",1130457600,4,167,5.222222222222222
2406345,5,B000B837XS,"Who else out there remembers that Radar marries a Korean girl and takes her back to the states? I lived in a remote rural area, and MASH was on one of the two TV channels that we could receive way out in the sticks, so I not only watched it regularly because I loved the show but also because there was 'nuthin' else. Because of this... though it has been many a year since that day, I sure do remember this happening. If my memory serves me right, this means he either comes back to the series, or at least at the end of the show, makes a brief reappearance.",1130025600,,559,4.090909090909091
2406346,5,B000B837XS,"MASH has been rated one of the funniest shows of all time.  It's a gem in an otherwise sea of boredom.  Granted that some seasons are funnier than others but that's par for the course.  Some say that Alan Alda was full of himself by the time the 9th season rolled around.  Truth is he may have been but he knew what he was doing.  Alda had become fond and protective of his character and rightly so.  He and the rest of the cast had invested a great deal in the show.  Alda's Groucho Marx approach to comedy added a lot lof laugh's to an already kooky show.  Somtimes serious, reflective, unbelieveable, and reverent.  MASH achieved something that is hard to achieve in television.  Mixing pathos and humor is very difficult at best but there are a handful of shows that mastered this art.  Namely: All in the Family, Night Court, Soap, Maude and The Golden Girls just to name a few.  All votes being counted All in the Family was probably the best at it.

MASH wasn't just funny, it was insane.  If you pay close attention you will notice that Hawkeye's verbal exhanges with Trapper John and B.J. are identical.  The lines are different but the rapid fire, timing and delivery are the same.  I believe that Alda didn't want to sacrfice the comedy by switching things too drastically.  The cast change was change enough.  The departure of Frank Burns was a necessity after awhile because people like Frank Burns don't change too often.  In a sitcom a character must show some growth or maturation otherwise the character stagnates and the overall tone of the show succumbs.  Case in point: Corporal Klinger finally starts to grow up and quits the crossdressing dodge.  He takes over the company clerk spot after Radar gets sent home.  He had to change and mature.  The audience would have grown weary of his antics.

MASH is one of those shows in which you should collect all in the series because all though every show may not be funny to you, there are very funny shows from every season.  Watch them all.  If you don't you may not discover a few things that I did when I watched them.  Harry Morgan (Col. Potter) has a lovely bass singing voice.  Loretta Swit (Hot Lips) is very good at making herself shed tears.  William Christopher is a good dramatic actor as well as the tender hearted boxing priest, etc.

Finally, I don't know about you guys but I find that some of the best shows are the ones where the cast really like each other and get along well.  That shows up on the small screen.

If you've never seen MASH get it now.  See why war is heck!!!

2406347,5,B000B837XS,"A lot of people like to complain about the later years of M*A*S*H, saying it got too ""serious"" and that Alan Alda was too full of himself and the show got this whole ""anti-war"" attitude behind it. The original movie was perceived to have that same attitude by many to this day. I don't think I could do the work the characters in this Army hospital did on a daily (and sometimes more often) basis and NOT hate the war. By season three, we'd lost Henry Blake to a plane crash, and Trapper went home. A couple seasons down the road, Frank Burns went AWOL and that was the end of him. During season eight, Radar went home to take care of the family farm. Those are all realities of war, folks. M*A*S*H was a reflection of that. The war was not a funny place to be. The fact that these people could crack wise when they were up to their elbows in wounded soldiers was merely a reflection of how the human spirit can allow us to do things we never expected to be able to do, even in the face of huge adversity. I never found Col. Potter, Capt. Hunnicutt or Major Winchester inferior to Blake, Trapper and Frank in the least. Different, yes, but definitely not any less funny or less vital to the series' development. ER, now in its 13th season (I think), carries on with just about no one from the first season. People come and people go. I thought Season Nine of M*A*S*H was every bit as valid and as vital as the very first season...maybe for different reasons...but the show worked from strength to strength. I felt Col. Potter was a much more believeable than Henry Blake, not to say Blake wasn't funny. He was. But Harry Morgan brought something else to M*A*S*H that I don't think anyone else could have. Even Charles Emerson Winchester, as different as you could ask for form Frank Burns realized this was a family, not just a team of surgeons stuck in Hell's kitchen, and lo and behold, had his moments of downright nobility. Those who stuck with the show through its entire run saw that. M*A*S*H Season Nine will be a welcome addition to my M*A*S*H collection. Every single season of M*A*S*H had classic episodes...not very many series can claim that. The show still fascinates me and makes me laugh 22 years after it departed first-run network TV. I have them all to this point, and I'll gladly buy the rest!",1128643200,113,2312,4.442352941176471
2406348,4,B000B837XS,For some reason the first couple of the Winchester years seemed weaker. Too much was missing. But now the show seemed to have again found it's stride. This look would be pretty much it throughout the show's three final years but it got even more serious by season 11. The show was definitely permanently slightly inferior to the way it had been in the Trapper years.,1128384000,3,366,4.5606060606060606
2406349,5,B000B837XS,"mash series 1-6 was first class A+++ seasons. while 7 and 8 were still good seasons within themselves, they seemed to be just a little bit dull with something missing for whatever reason. the show almost became a parody of itself...however season 9 was a nice change!!  hot lips looks alot better....not so fake! and BJ's moustache is trimmed to make it not so porno.  season 9 is by far the best season of the latter seasons. it is a must have....cant wait till it's release on dvd!!!! =)",1127865600,6,489,4.48314606741573
2406350,5,B000B837XS,"Season 9 is the first time when we see Corporal Klinger do his duties for the departed O'Reilly back at the beginning of season 8. Anyway the episodes on the DVD with the summary are as follows.

REVIEW

The ninth season of ""MASH"" pushes the ensemble cast and crack writing and creative staff even further, and delivers a humanely compelling product.  The majority of episodes from this season stand as some of the best in the series.

The season premiere ""The Best of Enemies"" tells of Hawkeye ostensibly on R&R, yet ambushed by a gun-wielding enemy soldier.  Though the soldier doesn't speak English, and Hawkeye doesn't know Korean, the surgeon must perform delicate surgery on a critically wounded friend of the soldier while under gunpoint.  The episode ""Letters"" has the 4077th write responses to a classroom of young students in America, and Hawkeye gets a particularly tough assignment.  Ultimately, the power of this episode comes from the philosophical and emotional journeys of the soldier doctors as they reflect on their jobs, their pastimes, and the life they're missing back in the States.  A particularly powerful Christmas-themed show called ""Death Takes A Holiday"" emphasizes the limitations of surgeons as a trio of them work to save a badly wounded man before Christmas is over.  ""Father's Day"" puts a spotlight on Loretta Swit, as Margaret's crusty father 'Howitzer' Al Houlihan comes to the camp.  This is also a very strong episode for Harry Morgan as Colonel Potter.

The ninth season of ""MASH"" demonstrates depth, intelligence, and thematic cohesion as well as richness.  It is absolutely another great season for the landmark series.",1303689600,,1508,5.2375

2406662,3,B000B837XS,Not awful but definately not perfect.  The dvd's play but I don't like that instead of going to the table of contents so I can select which episode I'd like to watch each dvd automatically launches into the 1st episode. All 8 of my other M*A*S*H dvd sets allow you to first select which episode you would like to watch.  There were a couple of scratches but then again the dvd's do play I just don't think it was worth the 'new' price.  The vendor in TX should check with who he received these dvd's from.,1286668800,,505,4.239583333333333

2406667,5,B000B837XS,"It's a classic series with a long-lost, intelligent sense of humor not seen on TV these days. It was relevant then and still is now. It was a series with a social conscious. The DVD delivers quality better than I remember on the TV of old. Not much to say other than that. I'm still buying a season or so at a time until I collect them all.

I will say that Amazon's DVD packaging is horrible these days. When I first started buying the series over a year ago, it came in a box. Now it comes in a padded envelope! That's nuts! I have returned many, many DVDs lately because they come crushed, the inner plastic holders broken, and the DVDs scratched.

No matter what DVD you buy from them now, if it comes in an envelope - check it out immediately and return it if damaged. They pay the return postage and send you another one free of charge.",1251504000,,842,4.191358024691358
2406668,5,B000B837XS,This is another great MASH DVD - we have almost the entire set now.  The only problem is that it was ordered in early December and wasn't received until February 10th.  This is most unusual for Amazon since products are almost always shipped immediately.  The good part of that is that the price was lowered.,1238976000,,308,4.5636363636363635

2406682,5,B000B837XS,"In season 9 you see the series get back to its roots and you see again the return of the best that MASH has to offer.  I loved the season, the first time I've been able to say that since season 6.  My favorite episodes from this season:

Cementing Relationships
Letters
Death takes a holiday
No Sweat
Blood Brothers (Patrick Swayze is great in this episode)

My only concern in this season is the beginning of a trend that I'm not to happy about.  In Season 9 you see Klinger taking on more of a leading role in the shows.  You see him doing more and more, and while I like the Lebanese clerk he's beginning to get on my nerves.  While Klinger makes a great supporting character he was never supposed to be a major character.  Think about it, the more you see Klinger leading the less you see of Hawkeye, BJ, Charles, Potter, and the like.",1218672000,,839,4.265822784810126

All of the episodes in this season are great, especially ""No Laughing Matter"" where Hawkeye and BJ make a bet to see if Hawkeye could go a whole day without making a joke, and Charles gets even with Colonel Horace Baldwin, the man who sent him to the unit.

2406700,5,B000B837XS,"The secret to understanding and appreciating season 9 of M*A*S*H can be found in this statement from Amazon's review: ""In M*A*S*H's ninth season, tears flow almost as freely as the blood and laughter, affording the decorated ensemble (Alan Alda, Harry Morgan. Loretta Swit, and David Ogden Stiers were all nominated for Emmys) ample dramatic license."" In short, the series was neither searching for an identity not struggling for an audience...it had both. M*A*S*H had re-invented itself successfully in the wake of departures from Larry Linville, McLean Stevenson, Wayne Rogers & Gary Burghoff. The cast members that would see the series to its end in Season 11 were fully formed in Season 9...no longer the ""new guys."" The best example of how ""tears flow almost as freely as the blood and laughter,"" as Amazon puts it, can be found in ""Death Takes A Holiday."" I won't offer spoilers here, but let's just say that it's the combination of 1). The Christmas Eve activity of Hawkeye, Hot Lips and B.J., 2). Winchester's ""traditional"" act, 3). The statement that Klinger makes when he brings dinner to Winchester, and 4). Potter's reaction to all of the above. This is a solid, powerful season. The creative team behind M*A*S*H knew when it was time to call it a day. Season 9 was not that time. They still had something to say, and they said it eloquently.",1177027200,2,1354,4.865800865800866

2406705,2,B000B837XS,"I loved the early M*A*S*H episodes.  Equally intelligent, humane, cynical, sardonic, and just right out hilarious, they were some of the best television ever produced.  Unfortunately, the show moved away from this formula (which worked amazingly well) to the latter day formula.  The show became overly preachy, annoying, incredibly sanctimonious, politically correct, badly acted, badly written, pretentious, and downright silly at times.  The show ran for 11 seasons, and with all sitcoms that run too long, it quickly ran out of juice.  But that doesn't excuse the poor quality of the shows from 1975 onwards.  Hawkeye and BJ's characters became incredibly annoying, especially Hawkeye and his constant flirting with nurses.  It was funny early on, but as he aged, it became more and more childish.  Alda's acting is way over the top in these later seasons.  Since he was the one running the show for all intended purposes, I suppose no one told him to tone it down.  Charles is really the only intelligent and sympathetic character here, and the one I like the most.  You're not supposed to like him because of his ""blue blood"" upbringing, but you do anyway, because Hawkeye and BJ are so damn irritating.  You would think that BJ and Hawkeye wouldn't be so naive sometimes about things, considering they've been in a war now for years.  Soldiers are very jaded, cynical people, and with good reason.  They don't get more naive as time progresses.  The early episodes had Hawkeye much more jaded than in these later ones, and it should be the other way around.  Watch the first 3 seasons (except when Henry gets killed, which was just done for cheap shock value).  Those were the best...",1155772800,6,1691,4.918727915194347
2406706,5,B000B837XS,"MASH matured each season, adding more depth to both the performances and script. There has never been as good a TV series, and continues to gain significance as the years pass.",1152489600,,176,4.709677419354839
2406707,3,B000B837XS,"Unfortunately, by season nine, the producers of MASH were really scraping the bottom of the barrell for stories.  I mean, who cares about a bridge tournament?  Or the fact that Charles takes karate lessons because someone punched him in the nose?  And am I the only one absolutely sick and tired of watching BJ Honeycutt complain yet again about not being with his wife Peg?  The stories in series 9 just aren't compelling like in the earlier series.  I wonder now if I should bother buying seasons ten and eleven.

Another problem is there are only twenty episodes in season 9 (unlike the standard 24).  4 episodes is two hours (the length of time for a typical movie) but there doesn't seem to be any discount on the price to take that into account.",1150934400,5,751,4.559701492537314

After the third season though, it seemed things started to slowly go down hill.  We miss Colonel Blake, Trapper John and Frank!  Colonel Potter is grouchy most of the time, B.J.'s jokes are corny, and Winchester is only funny some of the time.  It just seems like after season five especially, things start to get so serious.  I thought MASH was a funny show!  Why all the issues now and tears?  The show on season nine when Hawkeye has his breakdown is especially finger down throat.  And no Radar or Klinger in a dress?  It's just not the same.  But we'll keep buying the seasons.  There is always hope!",1138492800,5,704,4.464566929133858

""The M*A*S*H: Season Nine set includes all 20 episodes from that year, which aired from 1980-1981. Each episode can be viewed with or without a laugh track, the latter of which will no doubt make for an odd experience - tears notwithstanding. Of course, while the show at this point had long since left the zanier days of Colonel Blake, Frank Burns, and Trapper John behind, the latter-day episodes offer a different brand of humor along with an increasingly more serious and dramatic - albeit occasionally heavy-handed - tone. But it is M*A*S*H, after all. And what would M*A*S*H be without a sanctimonious speech from Alan Alda here or there?""  (summary by Now Playing Magazine)
