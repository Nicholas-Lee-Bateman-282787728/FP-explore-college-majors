Could someone please tell me the  name of the rapturous song in the movie to which Neave and Jack are dancing?  It is a very familiar one, but I simply cannot think of the name of it--senior moment. LOL I would like to purchase the song for my iTunes library.  Thanks so much!",1484092800,,359,4.220588235294118

She ultimately follows a trail that leads from the glittering pleasure palaces of New Yorks rich and beautiful to the Mafia underworld  a sinister labyrinth of greed and ambition that steers Neeve into mortal danger: a killer closer than she could ever dream.",1391990400,,550,5.1

8212428,5,B000UAE7JU,"If you love Mary Higgins Clark mysteries as much as I, than this movie version is a must-have!  Connie Selleca does a wonderful portrayal as Neeve, and the movie is true to the book.  It is very entertaining, and something I will watch over again.  A really light and fun mystery!",1362960000,,280,4.450980392156863
8212429,4,B000UAE7JU,"Neave Kearny (Connie Selleca) runs a fashion design house in New York and lives with her father Myles (Beau Starr). Myles was a police commissioner who is now retired from the force after having a heart attack. The columnist Ethel Lambston (Patricia Gage) is a close friend of Neave's and comes to her for advice about dressing for a big social occasion. Then Ethel goes missing and is later found dead. Now Neave has already lost her mother, also a dress designer, when she was murdered while out on her morning run. Neave still runs the same route - but is disturbed when she finds she is being followed. Myles, when he was working, had mob boss Nicky Sepetti Sr. (Frank Pelegrino) put in jail for ten years and believes that he is responsible for his wife's murder. TV journalist Jack Cambell (Simon MacCorkindale) has a minor role as someone who pursues Neave romantically. I shall say no more about the plot as this would spoil the twists and turns in this gripping thriller. I haven't read the book but I found the film exciting and I didn't find what some reviewers claim is miscasting to be offputting. I just accept these films as they are.",1350864000,3,1149,4.58252427184466

8212431,1,B000UAE7JU,I love Mary Higgins Clark books but somehow they don't convert to good movies.  This movie had very poor acting and it made the movie extremely hard to watch.  I should have just reread the book instead of wasting my time and money on this movie.,1244160000,,246,4.326086956521739

I was thrilled when this MHC movie was finally released...I had seen almost all of her made for TV movies, but this is the best so far.  It has a great cast (Connie Seleca is absolutely beautiful as always) and the story is very well done.  It doesn't have that ""slapped together as quickly as possible to make a buck"" feel that a lot of the other MHC movies seem to have.  If you are going to buy one of MHC's movies, this is definitely the one to get.",1197417600,4,664,5.62
