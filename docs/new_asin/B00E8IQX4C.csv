Goldman aka Iqbal Seth ( Rishi Kapoor) is the target of extraction in this film. A businessman turned gangster, has been hiding from the US and India in Karachi for several years. He has been a recluse who could not attend his daughter's wedding but plans to come out of hiding to attend his son's wedding at a prominent Karachi hotel. The chief of India's intelligence agency plans a covert operation involving four agents Wali Khan (Irrfan Khan), Rudra (Arjun Rampal), Zoya (Huma Qureshi) and Aslam (Aakash Dahiya). DDAY begins with a wedding and Operation Goldman.

Dday has a frenetic first half with relentless pacing and action. The film begins with a wedding and is brilliantly shot to the tune of Dum Dum Mast Kalandar as the mission starts taking shape. The botched mission then starts with a flashback mode exploring the lives of the individuals in flashback leading up to the day of the mission. There are a few dull moments after the intermission but these moments don't bore you. The final hour picks up pace and reaches a mad frenzy during the last 40 minutes- a lot of fun...

The movie is 2 hours and 23 minutes long but I did not find the pace slow.

All the actors put in awesome performances. Arjun Rampal and Irfan are amazing. Shruti Hassan and Huma Qureshi match the males as well. Rishi Kapoor is simply great as Goldman - Why did this man waste all his time all these years appearing in mundane films? He does not speak much throughout the film but watch his mannerisms and listen to his monologue during the last 10 minutes- great dialogues BTW.

Shankar -Ehsaan- Loy deliver a great soundtrack. Dum a Dum is rebooted with new instrumentation but the song cannot be enjoyed completely because the action on the screen divides our attention. The best song is Alvida- beautifully shot with a clever narrative. See it to believe me.....

Nikhil Advani has enjoyed mediocre success and spectacular failures in recent times. This film should resurrect him- great direction.

DDAy is a raw, gripping film and will linger with you for a long time. Five stars. 7/25/2013",1378598400,,2159,4.710875331564987

After America successfully carried out their plan of executing  Bin Laden in Pakistan. I think the onus is on India to carry out their own such mission. Wouldn't that be awesome?
