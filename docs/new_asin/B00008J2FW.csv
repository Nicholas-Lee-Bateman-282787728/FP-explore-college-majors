1848670,3,B00008J2FW,"""Great American Scenic Railroads"" is a 6-DVD set with about 12 hours of rail video. Each DVD typically contains two one-hour programs. The words ""scenic"" and ""journeys"" on the cover suggest passenger and/or excursion trains, but about half of the video is freight operations. That's OK by me, as I like both. The freight action is a mix of vintage and contemporary, and the passenger is a mix of excursion and Amtrak. The video quality is first rate, and the mix of narration and natural sound is quite good. So this collection has a lot of positives.

But this Questar product is--perhaps in its entirety--a remix of previously published material. This fact is not mentioned anywhere in the online details or on the jacket or liner notes. Here's where eight of the twelve hours were previously seen:

""Continental Divide"" is Wild Rose Productions' ""VIA Rail Across Canada.""
""Donner Summit""  was previously released by Pentrex.
""Surfline"" was released by Video Rails in 1993.
""Blue Mountains"" is the first hour from Pentrex's ""The Blue Mountains Combo.""
""Great Mississippi"" is an edited portion of Pentrex's ""Winter on the Upper Mississippi.
""Shenandoah"" is in part the Pentrex video ""Winchester and Western.""
""Rio Grande"" and ""Union Pacific"" are both Pentrex products.

In some cases, the video footage credits the prior publisher; but in other cases there is no such credit.

Don't get me wrong....the video is of high quality, and this is an excellent ""collection.""  After all, Pentrex, Video Rails, and Wild Rose do great work. But I would have appreciated being told in advance that this collection ""contained previously-released video.""

If you already have a modest railfan library, be prepared to duplicate some of your current holdings. This risk of duplication makes the video less a bargain than it might have been.",1215475200,28,1826,5.10738255033557
1848671,5,B00008J2FW,"I love scenic DVDs. I hoped this would be a DVD set that would put me in the seat of various scenic train routes and allow me to ooh and aah at the beautiful sights passing by. However, this DVD package does not do that. Instead, it does something I enjoyed just as much. These DVDs show you detailed footage of day to day operations of various train routes, mostly from outside the train. You will see a little bit of everything including track repairs, snow clearing and such. The quality of the footage is excellent. The narration is perfect. It is detailed but not annoying or full of tech talk that no one but railway fanatics would understand. The sound is also extremely good. Make no doubt, the scenery is beautiful. In fact, most of the footage is what I would describe as awesome. It more than took care of my desire to see scenic footage. This DVD package definitely needs to be part of your collection if you enjoy watching or riding trains. I HIGHLY recommend.",1186531200,40,973,4.47191011235955
1848672,1,B00008J2FW,"Great American Scenic Railways. That title conjoured up an image for my wife and I that meant we were going to be getting our hands on something we, being a couple who have found we enjoy boat and rail sightseeing excursions, could put to good use as a vacation planning guide. How wrong we were. If, however, you're a rail-fan, Someone whose main focus is trains, train cars, yards, and rails, this set is probably a winner.",1080950400,26,425,4.532467532467533

1848693,4,B00008J2FW,LOADS of trains...current & no longer in business railroads.  Beautiful scenery.  A few minor errors in narration concerning direction of travel but definitely worth adding to your collection if you're a train zealot.,1399766400,,217,5.545454545454546

1848705,5,B00008J2FW,"These 6 DVD's each have two programmes covering various parts of the USA in glorious colour. The quality of the photography is often quite stunning, the scenery is always so.
They show a  wide range of motive power, not always steam, and often give details of the locomotives seen. This is of added interest to railway enthusiasts, especially for those of us in the UK.
One word of warning for other potential purchasers in the UK. Not only will you pay VAT on this purchase (over 15) but you will also be faced with an 8 additional handling charge by the Post Office.
Not-with-standing this, I think they were a most entertaining purchase.

1848706,5,B00008J2FW,This disc set is all around decent for the price.  They have some information about the different lines that are include and show a fair amount of trains just plowing through the countryside.,1376524800,,191,4.787878787878788
1848707,3,B00008J2FW,The video itself was done very well.  My disappointment was in the fact that it was more history of the trains and the camera was aimed more on the train than on the scenery.  It never showed or maybe very little footage from inside the train looking out the window at the view.  The inside view was focused on the workings of specialized compartments.  I wanted to see the view.  It wasn't worth the money i paid in my opinion!  Sorry,1374796800,4,435,4.308641975308642
1848708,5,B00008J2FW,The DVD follows the trains on their journey. Also describes where they are going and some details that a train lover would want to know. As good as following the real trains.,1373500800,,174,4.46875

1848711,1,B00008J2FW,"I have driven between Silverton and Durango Colorado several times and that is one of the most spectacular drives in the US.  I was really looking forward to seeing that gorgeous scenery from the perspective of the rails.  Unfortunately, most of the images are from either Durango or Silverton, and when there are scenes from along the route, they are highly duplicative.  In all of the videos that I have watched, the editors will take one piece of footage and reuse it many, many times.  Also, on the Durango-Silverton episode, the photography isn't so great.  Poor choice of season for several of the scenes, not full winter, or full summer, or fall colors.  Just drab remnants of winter for several scenes.

Furthermore, this series is much more about trains that it is about scenery.  Train lovers may love this set, and if I were a train enthusiast I suppose that I would be willing to give three stars.  But even if I were a train enthusiast, I would still knock a few stars off because there is so little footage that is used far too much.",1291507200,6,1047,4.586021505376344

Most of the pictures were taken in the 1970's and 1980's.  The filming allows plenty of time to view the trains and is somewhat tranquil.,1248393600,4,269,4.911111111111111

7984800,1,B00008J2FW,"This is a collection of the least inspiring footage one can hope to avoid.  After one disc - and falling asleep - we fast forwarded through hours of tape hoping to find something interesting.  The footage is outdated, the pace is slow, the narration is sparse and insufficient, and the editing is poor.  It is a shame the producers missed a prime chance to highlight railroading to the non-exposed public.  Don't get me wrong.  We are train buffs.  We love travelling by train but this would make even an avid traveler swear off the tedium.  We have been in many of the places mentioned in the films and thought the productions absolutely missed the best parts, the interesting features, and the highlights of the area.  This is certainly not a travelogue. Who would want to get on a train after this train-wreck?  Maybe if you just like looking at dirty trains over and over and over again, there might be some interest.  Otherwise, do not waste your time or money.  We gave our set to a program for the autistic - maybe they can make sense of it.",1459382400,,1048,4.5212765957446805
