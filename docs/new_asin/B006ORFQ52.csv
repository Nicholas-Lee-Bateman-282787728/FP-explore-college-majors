8502124,5,B006ORFQ52,"I have purchased several videos from Lynne Weldon, I rate his videos as top notch grade AAA+ because Lynne has been there done that, nothing better than listening to a man that has actually hiked all three of the United States National trails, the PCT, CDT & the AT, I like Lynne's approach on including other professional ""thru hikers"" who have also hiked all three trails, several who have authored their own books and videos of their vast experience in the thru hiking world. Thanks Lynne, I enjoyed the two videos I ordered this go around, best wishes to you and all the other hikers.",1389830400,,588,4.609523809523809
