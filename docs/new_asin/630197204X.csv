397807,5,630197204X,"This beautiful, sad film is quintissential Peckinpah, and for my money is better than even WILD BUNCH (which is generally regarded as Peckinpah's masterpiece).  Once an outlaw, Pat Garrett (James Coburn) is now a  bought-and-paid for lawman assigned to hunt down and kill his former cohort  Billy the Kid (Krisstoffersen).  Though he eventually succeeds, Garrett  ironically sews the seeds of his own destruction, while ensuring that The  Kid's name will live on forever. The fascinating, horrifying slow-motion  violence and operatic pace that made Peckinpah a legend are here in spades,  along with a great supporting cast and haunting score by Bob Dylan.  You'll  want to watch the ""Keep the change"" scene a million times!",916358400,2,725,5.280701754385965

397890,2,630197204X,"I wanted to like this movie.  I've wanted to see it for a long time, because of an interest in Billy the Kid.  There were a few interesting scenes, and James Colburn is great.  However, Kristofferson is boring as Billy and Bob Dylan is just the worst as an actor.  His music is okay except it feels like they just play the same 3 riffs over and over and over again for 2 hours and it just adds to the flat feel of the movie.  The movie has no emotion.  Scenes that should have been sad are just blah and scenes that should have been exciting were just as blah, and a couple scenes make no sense or seem to be totally pointless.  The whole movie is a real snoozer, which is sad because with so many great actors it should have been fantastic. They make all kinds of excuses about arguments with the studio and everybody getting sick.  Also, the extras on the DVD are so cheaply produced they seemed ameteur and didn't add much value.  They could have talked more about Billy the Kid or something, but it was mostly just all about excuses why the movie was so bad.  I am kinda glad I finally saw the movie, but now it will just take up space in my DVD cabinet. I watched the special edition and I don't know when I will get around to watching the preview version.

397935,5,630197204X,"""Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid"" is my favorite western, even more than ""The Magnificent Seven"" or ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"", more even than Pecikinpah's other masterpieces, ""Ride the High Country"" and ""The Wild Bunch."" The movie has its flaws, in particular of continuity, perhaps caused by the careless studio editing that ruined the film's 1973 release. Bob Dylan seems totally out of place as the Kid's sidekick, Alias, and gives a totally leaden performance, although his soundtrack is masterful--particularly the iconic ""Knockin' on Heaven's Door,"" arguably his finest song. On the plus side are Dylan's score; Lucien Ballard's painterly photography; Rudy Wurlitzer's script is full of memorable lines and witty repartee (Kid: I heard God was fast, but I'd have to go up against him myself before I'd bet on it. Garrett: You will.) Slim Pickens, Chill Willis, L.Q. Jones, Richard Jaekel, and perhaps best of all, Jason Robards Jr. in an all-too-brief cameo as Governor Lew Wallace (author of ""Ben Hur""). James Coburn is wonderful as a gruff, aging Pat Garrett, a man with a job to do who will let nothing, even friendship, stand in his way. Kris Kristofferson, at the height of his country-rock stardom, plays Billy (Henry McCartney, aka Kid Antrim, aka William H. Bonney, aka Billy the Kid) as a charismatic sociopath whose affable good nature hides a totally ruthless killer with complete disregard for human life. Pecikinpah frames the tragedy not so much as a struggle between good and evil as a struggle behind competing world views, the old, agrarian values of the western frontier giving way to the forces of capitalism and modernization. Long before Clint Eastwood's overrated ""Unforgiven,"" Peckinpah sets out to demythologize the Old West, in the process creating a new and even more potent mythology.",1496102400,5,1826,5.130872483221476

398032,5,630197204X,"Loved this movie.  Very good story and very good acting.  I wasn't sure about James Coburn as Pat Garrett, but he did a wonderful job and was very believable.  A very young Kris Kristofferson (early in his career) as Billy the Kid was an excellent casting choice.  Saw other familiar faces in this one from other movies I have seen and realized this was the start for a lot of them (even saw a couple of faces that were in American Graffitti).  Very good western, very good Billy the Kid story that seems pretty accurate, and very compelling.  I would forewarn anyone, though, there is a lot of nudity in this one.  Not only female (topless) but male backsides as well as crude sexual references.  So, if you don't like watching those kinds of movie, I suggest you skip this one, but if you don't mind it, then the story and acting are worth watching.",1470182400,,851,4.445161290322581

Then I have to watch Mr. Zimmerman ooze cool as an actor.  Gag.  Then Billy the Kid who died at 21 is played by a 37 year old and Pat Garret is also played by someone 20 years old than he was at the time.  The movie is full of ugly nude women.  Everything is gratuitous.  The plot is incoherent and doesn't really tell any kind of a story.  Young Guns is 1,000 times better than this (which is an insult to to Young Guns).  This movie is a zero.  So is The Wild Bunch.  Ride the High Country is a 10+..  Avoid this at all costs.  Mine is in the garbage.",1462492800,,720,3.9166666666666665

Good luck finding the authentic film.",1462492800,,298,4.267857142857143
398069,5,630197204X,"This is THE definitive Western in the view of many of us who grew up watching the genre, but never being entirely convinced of it's Hollywood-produced ethos. Here Peckinpah's vision provides us with an alternative: there are good guys and bad guys, alright, just not the ones we were always told to believe in. This is a flat-out revisionist Western that doesn't even try to hide that fact, and it eschews any claims to complete historical accuracy (Kristofferson is deliberately ""too old"" to play the Kid, for example). But Hollywood machine movies did the same, so Peckinpah made up his own legend from a wholly different point of view. Happily, this version does not turn out to be the total hippie vision of the Kid one would have expected from a 1973 film with Bob Dylan doing the (raw, excellent, understated) acoustic soundtrack. It is the negative character, the sold-out, System-embracing Garrett, who here talks about change, progress, and all the other phony upper-class liberal sentiments that the hippy dream dissolved into, while the wild and wooly but good-natured Kid simply wants the land to be conserved as it is and becomes a heroic martyr because of it. Peckinpah is not without sympathy for the alcoholic, whoremongering, inwardly depressed Garrett, though, and one wonders if part of Garrett does not wish himself martyred as well as the Kid. The director's cut wraparound story offers a possible redemption in that regard, as it shows a version of Garrett's eventual historic fate that wasn't seen in the original studio cut of the film which so troubled Peckinpah. The performances here, wrenched from actors suffering through an infamously difficult shoot, are all excellent, the cast perhaps not even realizing how well they were doing under Peckinpah's artistic tutelage. Not only the leads but even the most ""minor"" players seem to be living their roles rather than acting them, and the movie is loaded to the brim with realistic lines unforgettable to Western fans. Grim and profane but also lyrical, with Peckinpah's  eye for the ghostly Western vista seeing everything, the film's images, even those clipped by regular outbursts of poetically bloody violence, bear repeated viewing, and continue to be treasured by this fan thirty years after first experiencing them. And though this modern classic is seen as too downbeat and somber by some, I think that one of the film's conclusive images - a rebellious little boy throwing pieces of dirt after the murderous Garrett - speaks much more positively of the undying creative spirit that allowed it to be made.",1460332800,,2589,5.049065420560748

398123,5,630197204X,"Each scene of this movie sublimates into its own individual piece of art. Literally, it appears that this movie was not written and/or filmed to be a seamless cohesive time stitched piece; each piece is filmed and the narrative and dialogue comes together in sort of a month long or 6 week long event.

I saw this movie 20 years ago and received it nonchalantly, even indifferently (despite being a huge Kris Kristofferson music fan, and a mega western movie fan). While Kris' acting didn't grow on me much, but it did some, this movie is not so much about 'The Kid' as it is Pat Garret, who is played by James Coburn.

Yes, American music legend Bob Dylan is in this. And his part is paltry, his scenes are cut/edited in such a way that his character is left somewhat dump and illiterate. But then he winds up with some speaking parts, and it works.

I am well versed in the western genre and I my observations and musings on this movie are strictly based on this genre. This movie is to be enjoyed in every way; from start to finish or scene to scene - it really captures the essence of the period in which it is portrayed and the people who actually lived this. I based this on countless readings of the very events. There is an austere quality to the happenings in this. And oh.. you get Bob Dylan writing a soundtrack for it (you will need to read about the differences of opinion on 'tween Bob and the producers and how lots of his music/scenes got cut, all to our [the audience's] screwing).

I shoot, I shoot cowboy shooting competitions, I shoot all these guns. I know them intimately. The shotgun coin scene is possible, but not probable. I mean that is like a month's pay in coins in those cartridges; why not just put washers in there or the equivalent? Hell, double-ought buckshot (00 Buck) would do a better job. Leave that slight out and WOW.. amazing gun work. Totally amazing.

Many people will get this movie/watch this movie to see something about Billy 'The Kid'. You better be more interested in Pat Garett than The Kid - This movie is about Garett. And you need to do your Googling about Pat Garett before watching this. Read about him. Even his Wikipedia page will prep you amazingly for this movie. In fact you'll be lost without it.

The Lincoln County range wars are stuff of true American old west legend. None of it was pretty or neat. But it happened. Good people died, men and women both. And this movie .. I said above, each scene sublimes. It is an American western classic. A gem of the genre.

To compare this against the rest, including ""The Wild Bunch"", ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"", ""Fist Full of Dollars"", ""For a Few Dollars More"", ""Hondo"", ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"", and about 10 others.. I am firmly putting this in my own personal top 5 all time westerns.

It grew on me as I got older. James Coburn never did a better job, at least not that I saw. I mean his gun play in this is beyond spectacular; it's completely natural and I think he really killed those guys ;). He drinks, he smokes, he rides, he kills.. and it all looks perfectly natural and normal.

Kris's gun work is amazing as well. I shoot single action Colts all the time. He has some funky techniques, but it looks like it works for him. He handles a Winchester like it's his natural thing. And rides a horse well.

You got Slim Pickins and Harry Dean Stanton in this, plus some other familiar faces. I guess if you don't like this movie then you don't like westerns.

EDIT: Ok, I wrote the review based on the version on the disk that does not include the scene with Elijah Cook. Love Elijah's acting, the movies he's been in, but I did not like the version of this movie as much as the version without him.",1449360000,7,3717,4.380261248185777

A simple story, played by Kris K, and James Coburn, with then-wife Rita Coolidge and of course Bob Dylan who plays a knife thrower named ""Alias"" Roger says everything I would say and in much shorter format, but again, the more time that passes the more Iconic the actors and movie become to me. It is a gas to see these folks as I remember them and not as they are today. Yes, we all get older, it is, as they say, what it is. But some movies I enjoy ""because"" of the simplicity and the actors. Unlike Ebert, I love Bob Dylan, but who would ever say he sang well??? He is an American Icon and in my opinion, not very many other poet-songwriters are left. His words and melodies are unique to Bob Dylan. He also tickled me with his recent interview in the AARP Magazine. Welcome to old age Mr. Dylan, I'm right here with you buddy.

398174,3,630197204X,"This was no more impressive this time (2015) than when it came out.

Slow, self-important 1973 flick with lots of posing and more attempted poignancy with camera and acting per speech than the script generally warrants, or rewards. Conversations arise as if from nowhere, and often lack natural flow ...soon after which 11 people are shot dead. The point that life is cheap, in this world, is underscored and belaboured, and credulity is stretched way past the hilt. For instance, when characters seem only mildly concerned as they are about to die. Not only do you not care, you're practically invited not to. Until, of course, the culmination, when the key character dies and--very much against the odds--you're inexplicably expected to reckon it makes some difference.

There are precious few scenes of stylized violence of the kind that made Peckinpah's name--which might have made watching this worthwhile. It's as if he was trying to emulate Sergio Leone's pasta westerns without grasping that the Italians brought to the genre way more than just long, ponderous silences. Tension and intensity are what's missing, along with a sense that at least some characters have to matter to the audience.

Aside from the stars, good yet brief appearances are put in by a very strong supporting cast: Slim Pickens, Jack Elam, Jason Robards, Katy Jurado, Harry Dean Stanton and Emilio Fernandez. Alas, most of this talent goes wasted. For instance, Fernandez declaims his dying speech with too much elocution and not half enough wounded-to-deathness. Rita Coolidge is also in it, but she rated no lines. Bob Dylan has a few, but expect little: he was clearly invited only to attract more audience. I'm a Dylan fan and a near-completist, but, other than for 'Knocking on Heaven's Door' and a perhaps his soundtrack's authentically scratchy sound, his presence hardly adds to the proceedings. As for the aural aspect, his soundtrack does not achieve what Alex North, Elmer Bernstein or Jerome Moross knew how to do; and forget about Ennio Morricone.

The film's point of biggest interest is in being told from the viewpoint of the villain, not the hero. Coburn and Kristofferson, who play these parts, do well, although they are not helped by the mostly laconic, and only sometimes ironic script. Coburn was very much in his prime, awaiting some right part to catapult him to the top rank ('Duffy' and 'The President's Analyst' show he had more than the fair talent and mere ruggedness he showed in 'Charade' and the two Flint flicks). Far better western vehicles could be listed by the dozen, from the sixties, before, and since. The original '3:10 to Yuma,' for one, where characters about to fight for their lives had no time to shave--unlike Kristofferson in this, apparently, before every scene.

Be warned that by all appearances horses got hurt making this movie. Also, note that this is from an era of sexual license when what was thought right was under re-definition, after a decade of the pill and the Beatles. We tend to forget that the likes of Hugh Hefner, Tom Jones and Dean Martin were also exerting influential roles in that area. As a result, the nascent notion of liberation then was about women's clothing--removing it, mostly--and this is what Peckinpah thought belonged in this flick. What was also considered cool was getting Zimmie to cameo in it, no matter what his role. So expect exposed breasts galore, strictly for decorative value, and one scene where our era's great poet quite literally reads off the labels of canned goods. Gripping, Bobby. More injuriously, some similar conceit led him to omit doing his homework to produce one of the most forgettable cowboy soundtracks ever.

Speaking of embellishments, as you might imagine from a well-funded movie with name stars, the locations, costumes and art direction are all far better than average. The DVD image could not be better, for transfers from pre-digital days. Still, this is recommended only for diehard Dylan fans, and admirers of Coburn, Kristofferson and Sam Peckinpah.",1427500800,2,4056,5.028273809523809

398178,5,630197204X,"A truly great movie - great, great, great!! Coming two years after Robert Altman's similarly-titled anti-Western featuring folk music (Leonard Cohen), Sam Peckinpah's version ups the ante by not just getting Bob Dylan to provide ten original songs for the soundtrack, but to even include the star musician with a small role as the perpetually lost-looking ""Alias"" in the film itself (giving him third-billing after James Coburn and Kris Kristofferson, who appears here in one of his earliest starring roles). Dylan gets a good line in early on, when Billy asks him ""Who are you?"" and Dylan shoots back ""That's a good question."" No wonder he simply wants to be called Alias. Ironically, it was Kris Kristofferson - who had once, as an aspiring musician, swept the floors of the studio where Dylan recorded Blonde On Blonde in 1966, but had been too intimidated to approach him - who introduced the singer to Peckinpah, who didn't know anything about Dylan, with songs Dylan written for the film; Peckinpah was apparently so moved by the songs that he gave Dylan a role in the film as well. The film was rife with studio battles, and many cast members got sick with influenza while on location! The studios chopped nearly 20 minutes from it, using six editors - a record at the time!

The story rambles around, following both Garrett and Billy around the country, shooting, killing, shooting, killing, and riding around the gorgeous landscape, into the sunset, etc. The action is sometimes disjointed, but each shot luscious, and both actors are fantastic (even if the clean-shaven-for-once 36-year-old Kristofferson was a bit old to be playing the 21-year-old Billy). There are luscious pre- and post-orgy scenes, with lots of pretty girls. Slim Pickens has a great scene when ""Knockin' On Heaven's Door"" is playing (with one outlaw looking quite a lot like a young W Axl Rose!), looking out across the river as he's bleeding to death, and Harry Dean Stanton is in a few as well. The film is very pastoral, with the occasional bloody shootout, with lots of sunsets.

This set comes with two discs and two cuts of the film itself - the 122-minute ""preview version"" which Peckinpah showed at his critics preview, and the 115-minute ""special edition"", which combined elements of the theatrical version, the preview version, and several new scenes never released in previous versions. The chopped-apart 106-minute release version is not included here at all.

There are also tons of great bonus features: ""Deconstructing Pat and Billy"" (14:44)). Talking to Katy Haber, who was Sam Peckinpah's assistant and companion from 1970 to 1977. The studio was expecting another Wild Bunch, so they took out the lyrical parts in editing. Release was rushed to get money to build the MGM Grand hotel in Las Vegas. ""Peckinpah had something that turned men and women on; electric, destructive, hurtful and sadistic. A rarity to meet, a rarity to work with, and a rarity to leave."" Then the ""One Foot In The Groove: Remembering Sam Peckinpah and other things"" (27:45), talking with Kris Kristofferson and Donny Fritts, focussing on Kristofferson's own life story. He stayed with Janis Joplin for a month and they were ""close friends"", when she started singing ""Bobby McGee."" Harry Dean Stanton helped him get into a film in Peru that was filmed with Dennis Hopper, his first after Easy Rider. Sam Peckinpah pulled a gun on Harry Dean Stanton and Donny. ""I loved Bob Dylan. He was the songwriter of my lifetime. He had a bigger effect on everybody. He affected the Beatles, he affected everybody. He brought songwriters their respect."" He calls Dylan a good addition to the film, although some thought that he was brought in to be commercial. Kristofferson saved Sam his job as director of Convoy. ""One For The Money and Sam's Song."" is a performance by Kristofferson and Fritts of those two songs, which Kristofferson wrote for Sam and played at his funeral in 1984.",1423180800,2,3947,4.941265060240964

As for telling the Billy the Kid story as history, ""Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid"" is not the best factual Billy the Kid movie, (""Young Guns"" details more incidents in his legend...""Gore Vidal's Billy the Kid"" has less fiction) but it is the best non-factual Billy the Kid movie.",1414022400,,880,4.432098765432099

Time has addled the pate because I remember some things differently such as Dylan's character Alias being killed, some scenes being shorter and some, well some were a complete new experience. So it was with relief I found out this is a movie which has been edited a number of times. Can I just say in New Zealand, when it was released, it was full houses of hippies and Maoris who whooped and hollered, and once the credits rolled i am not sure it was a good thing to be a chook settling into a dust bath in the back paddock. But I digress, has it survived the passage of time? Well the opening scene would not have made it through the cutting room. They sure looked like real chooks. Kris Kristofferson can act, Mr Dylan cannot. James Coburn held it all together and it still tells part of the tale of the outlaw (as one reviewer noted, warts and all-I did do a lot of scratching and me bum was sore from spending so much time in the saddle or sleeping on the ground). But it is a boys own film. Mateship and changing times, the fencing in of the Wild West etc, murder etc, guns etc, revenge etc and cool, mean sardonic looks at twelve paces. The women in the movie are mostly sextras. The cinematography is very good and creates a canvas to the story which gives the movie strength and beauty. The soundtrack is sublime. For that alone Mr Dylan deserved his knife whittling part.

398345,5,630197204X,"I first saw PAT GARRETT AND BILLY THE KID in a theater in the summer of 1973, even though I was underage and the movie was rated R, I never had any problem talking my father into going to see a western.  Little did we know that the movie we saw that year was a butchered  mockery of what director Sam Peckinpah had intended.  The production in Durango, Mexico had been grueling and Peckinpah had feuded with the brass at MGM constantly all the way through the post production when the editing was taken away from him and his hand picked crew and given over to the studio.  The whole production had been rushed by MGM head James Aubrey (a man whom I never read good word about)who wanted to goose the cash flow so they could begin building the MGM Grand in Las Vegas.  Peckinpah himself didn't help matters with his antagonistic attitude toward the studio heads, along with his heavy drinking and erratic behavior on the set.  In the end, it was not only a loss for Bloody Sam, but an even greater one for his fans and western lovers, who were denied the lyrical masterpiece Peckinpah wanted to make on the end of the Old West and the price that was paid by those who lived on after it.

But thanks to this great two disc DVD set, we now get a chance to see something very close to what Peckinpah intended to make.  Cut scenes have been restored and the movie has been reedited according to notes Peckinpah made and interviews with his close associates who were involved with the production.  It fills out the story of the two protagonists and brings into sharper focus the themes the director, who reworked Rudy Wurlitzer's original script, wove into the story: how men cling to the past even as it slips away from them; the intrinsic corruption of man's civilization and of his very nature itself and the terrible price of betrayal.  And the irony of all that struggle and sacrifice put in to tame the Old West and the frontier, only to turn around and look back with regret and mourning for what had been lost as soon as the job was done.

It starts off in the now restored opening sequence, which begins with Garrett's ambush and murder in 1908, paid for by the very men who had once hired him to get rid of the Kid, counter cut with scenes of Billy and his gang living it up back in the Fort Sumner of 1881 on the day that Garrett came to tell the Kid it was time to clear out of New Mexico.  No other western director but Peckinpah would have dared pull of something that daring and unconventional to begin a film, and the studio editors ruined it.  PAT GARRETT AND BILLY THE KID does suffer from a lack of coherence and to many viewers the movie meanders; it's structure is mainly a progression of set piece scenes as Garrett pursues the Kid around Lincoln County filled with encounters with colorful characters played veterans of many other classic westerns, both on the screen and TV: Slim Pickens, Jason Robards, Chill Wills, Jack Elam, Katy Jurado, Richard Jaeckel, Barry Sullivan, Gene Evans, Harry Dean Stanton, Luke Askew, R.G. Armstrong, Elisha Cook Jr, Richard Bright, Matt Clark, Paul Fix, L.Q. Jones, Emilio Fernandez-many of whom were part of the Peckinpah stock company. The only ones missing are Ben Johnson, Warren Oates and especially Strother Martin.  They could easily have replaced John Beck, and his 70's era porn-tache, with Martin in the role of deputy Poe.

Many of these great character stars were given moments where they truly shined; there is nothing in any other western like lawman Slim Pickens's last moments as he dies of a gut shot by the river, with his loyal wife and deputy, Jurado, silently weeping nearby.  Then there is the Kid's jailbreak in Lincoln and his final confrontation with Armstrong's pious Bob Olinger on the street or his matter of fact duel with Jack Elam's Alamosa Bill, when the latter tries to cheat to no avail. All simply unforgettable, as is Garrett's wordless confrontation with the man on the floating raft.  Wills gets an unforgettably profane monologue; in fact this movie has some of the most memorable dialog of any western-""There's a buck-sixty in Old Bob, dig the change out."" Fans could have a contest over which line is the best and most memorable.

The casting of James Coburn, another Peckinpah regular and close friend, as Garrett is spot on, as he captures the man's weary resignation at having to take a dirty job in order to get by, but then expertly conveys the guilt at having to kill former comrades along with the self hate at being unable to quit.  It is said that Peckinpah put a lot of himself into the script's characterization of Garrett: a man who'd had to make many a compromise in order to succeed.  Kris Kristofferson does a good job as Billy, a rock star outlaw, but the script never quite defines his character: is he a Robin Hood of the Old west or just an amoral murderer who has stayed too long?  I always thought there was something a little off kilter about Kristoffeson in this movie, he's clearly a few years too old and not physically right (the guy played football in college) in the historical sense; I never quite believe anybody would have nicknamed him ""the Kid"".  Jan Michael Vincent or the young Jeff Bridges might have been a better choice.  Then there is Bob Dylan as Alias, who proves that as an actor, he's a great songwriter; the music Dylan wrote for the film (his only movie score) is unforgettable, perfectly capturing the mood and accentuating the characters.

The two disc collection comes with excellent commentaries by Peckinpah biographers who well point out some of the problems with the film's structure, like Billy's lame motivation (Fernandez's death scene, which is badly written) for turning around and going back to Fort Sumner and a fatal confrontation with Garrett, along with some heavy handed Christ on the Cross symbolism when Billy is arrested.  The commentaries and restorations help explain the significance of Garrett's bedding of multiple prostitutes, a scene that seemed like one more piece of excessive nudity back in the 70's.  They also help explain that Peckinpah just wasn't talking about New Mexico in the 1880's, but Nixon's America of the late 20th Century, where Billy the Kid and his gang represented the rebellious attitudes of the counter culture while the men who hired Garrett (led by Robards's Governor Lew Wallace)were stand ins for Nixon and all those reactionaries who felt threatened by them. It is interesting to compare Peckinpah's movie to John Wayne's CHISUM, made in 1970 and covering roughly the same events and characters.

We didn't know it at the time, but PAT GARRETT AND BILLY THE KID would turn out to be Peckinpah's last western, that is if you don't count BRING ME THE HEAD OF ALFREDO GARCIA,and his career would go into decline in the years ahead.

398467,5,630197204X,"Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid (Sam Peckinpah, 1973, 122')

Western drama starring James Coburn, Kris Kristofferson and Bob Dylan, who composed several songs for the movie's score and soundtrack album Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid, which was released the same year. Written by Rudy Wurlitzer, the film is about an aging Pat Garrett who is hired as a lawman on behalf of a group of wealthy New Mexico cattle barons to bring down his old friend Billy the Kid. Filmed on location in Durango, Mexico.

The film was noted for behind-the-scenes battles between Peckinpah and the production company Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Soon after completion, the film was taken away from the director and substantially re-edited, resulting in a truncated version released to theaters and largely disowned by cast and crew members. Peckinpah's preview version was released on video in 1988, leading to a re-evaluation, with many critics hailing it as a mistreated classic and one of the era's best films.

Peckinpah believed this was his chance to make a definitive statement on the Western genre, and complete the revision he had begun with Ride the High Country (1962) and The Wild Bunch (1969). Working with Wurlitzer, he rewrote the script in order to create a more cyclical narrative, and added a prologue and epilogue depicting Garrett's own assassination at the hands of the men who hired him to kill Billy the Kid. Wurlitzer and Peckinpah had a strained relationship, and Wurlitzer would later write a book highly unfavorable to Peckinpah.

Peckinpah eventually cast country music star Kris Kristofferson as the outlaw; he was 36 when the film was made, playing 21-year-old Billy. Kristofferson's band would play small roles along with his then-wife Rita Coolidge. Kristofferson also brought Bob Dylan into the film. Initially hired to write the title song, Dylan eventually wrote the score and played the small role of ""Alias"". Peckinpah had never heard of Dylan before, but was reportedly moved by hearing Dylan play the proposed title song and hired him immediately. Among the songs written by Dylan for the film was ""Knockin' on Heaven's Door,"" still regarded as one of rock music's most enduring anthems.

Peckinpah deliberately cast his film's supporting roles with legendary Western character actors such as Chill Wills, Katy Jurado, Jack Elam, Slim Pickens, Barry Sullivan, Dub Taylor, R G Armstrong, Elisha Cook, Jr and Paul Fix. Jason Robards, who had starred in Peckinpah's earlier films, the television production Noon Wine (1966) and The Ballad of Cable Hogue (1970), had a cameo appearance as the governor. The large supporting cast also included Richard Jaeckel, Charles Martin Smith, Harry Dean Stanton, Matt Clark, L Q Jones, Emilio Fernndez, Aurora Clavel, Luke Askew, Jack Dodson, Richard Bright and John Beck.

By the time Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid was in the editing room, Peckinpah's relationship with the studio and his own producers had reached the breaking point. He did complete a preview version of the film, which was shown to critics on at least one occasion. Martin Scorsese, who had just made Mean Streets (1973), was at the screening, and praised the film as Peckinpah's greatest since The Wild Bunch.

Roger Ebert rated the film two stars out of four, beginning his review with ""Sam Peckinpah attempted to have his name removed from Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid. I sympathized with him. If this wasn't entirely his work, he shouldn't have had to take the blame."" Ebert went on to note, ""Another alarming factor is that no less than six editors are credited. Not assistant editors, but editors; this sets a modern-day record, I think. My guess is that there was an argument over the movie's final form, and that Peckinpah and MGM platooned editors at each other during the battle. You'd think the executives would have figured out that their only chance was to release the movie as Peckinpah made it; audiences were more interested in the new Peckinpah film than in still another rehash of Billy the Kid.""

In 1988, Turner Home Entertainment, with distribution by MGM, released Peckinpah's preview version of Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid on video and Laserdisc. This version led to a rediscovery and reevaluation of the film, with many critics praising it as a lost masterpiece and proof of Peckinpah's vision as a filmmaker at this time. The film's reputation has grown substantially since this version was released, and the film has come to be regarded as something of a modern classic, equal in many ways to Peckinpah's earlier films.

There is a message somewhere in this sorry story.

398468,5,630197204X,"Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid is one of the best movies ever made. Period. The ""special edition"", as it appears in this set, and despite what some reviewers suggest, is truly the definitive version of this film. The ""director's cut"" is improperly edited and the music (particularly) is improperly sync-ed up with the visuals, often crescendo-ing at the entirely wrong moments (see the scene where Sheriff Baker is shot and compare the versions to understand what I mean here). It is very plain that the ""special edition"" is ideal in nearly every respect. Even the added scene with Garrett's wife is powerful, as it highlights the desperation he feels when he visits the whores, a sense that is sadly missing from other versions.

If you haven't seen this film, I can safely say that it eclipses Sergio Leone's take on the western (though his films are good) and certainly rivals the best John Ford had to offer (he was the old master of the genre - see My Darling Clementine if you haven't yet). More importantly, it transcends the Western genre and is an amazing film for lovers of film in general (whether a novice fan [Star Wars], an intermediate fan [Kurosawa], or an advanced fan [Satyajit Ray]).

398469,5,630197204X,"When I first saw this movie I wasn't expecting it to be so good. I thought 'Oh great, here we go, another boring American western.' But it wasn't boring at all. I loved the whole dynamic of Garrett's character selling out yet still trying to hold on to that last piece of his past with Billy. It really feels he's having a constant battle inside his head about what to do. James Coburn had it down with this role, as he usually does. His portrayal of Garrett is amazing to watch. He takes no crap and likes his drink and his women. Billy's character, played by the great Kris Kristofferson, is at war with himself also, whether he should run to Mexico to escape Garrett's impending capture or stay and confront him. The whole movie is really centered around their relationship yet still has that feel of lost freedom, coming from the new government people trying to take over all the land. The movie has a good pace and a legendary score from Bob Dillon, who is in the movie as well. If you get the 2-Disc Special Edition then you get the 2 versions of the film which is a real treat, and some cool extras. I'm not sure how accurate the story follows what actually happened in real life but either way this is a great movie. If your on the fence about getting this, get it and enjoy if you like classic Westerns or are just interested in the story of Billy the Kid.

398472,4,630197204X,"Amazon reviewer Richard T. Jameson writes: ""This is one strange and original movie."" He might have added ""excellent"" as well, as there is so much to like in this very intelligent film. One particular example (and plot points will be revealed): when the blacksmith gives Billy the Kidd the unbroken horse for his getaway. Will Bonie let the blacksmith live? He does. But we're wondernig for the whole minute, Will Bonie go back, will he shoot him. How many films today have you thinking like that?

Peckinpah almost plays a joke on himself in the film's opening, where we see the chickens being blasted away in closeup. ""Here we go again,"" the viewer thinks. ""Another Peckinpah film."" But hardly. People are killed, but that's the story. And the film's brilliant finale: Kristofferson and Rita Coolidge in as sweet yet ungraphic a love scene as you will ever see, which Garrett (Coburn) allows to let finish. Then Bonie goes to the kitchen. Garrett is waiting. He lets Bonie see who's killing him -- he owes him that -- then does the deed, one quick fatal shot.

Then, in a totally original decision, there's no flashback to the film's first scene, where Garrett is killed, the only time I know of where a filmmaker allows the audience complete the loop themselves.

As for Dylan, gimmick or not, he pulls off both the acting and the soundtrack wonderfully. Both are perfect for the film.

398511,3,630197204X,"I remember seeing this movie in the theater when it was first released and it really did not create much of an impression on me.  As a matter of fact, unlike other Peckinpah westerns I had seen like ""The Wild Bunch"" or ""Major Dundee,"" I found it to be quite forgettable.  However I did not know at the time that MGM butchered this picture up in the editing room.
I just watched the re-edited, remastered edition from 2005 and found it to be enjoyable (if one can really call such a bleak film enjoyable.)  The basic premise is Sheriff Pat Garrett, bought and paid for by the rich ranchers, hunting his old friend Billy the Kid down (with the basic purpose of killing him.)  Billy is portrayed as a fun-loving Robin Hood-type beloved by the little people while Garrett is dour and unhappy.  James Coburn plays Garrett and the only scene where he seems truly happy is in an orgy with five prostitutes.  Kris Kristoferson plays Billy as the outlaw with a heart of gold and Bob Dylan wanders through the film with the almost no dialogue and the same expression on his face.  (He does supply the music.)  The really cool thing about this movie though is that it features almost every veteran western character actor around at the time: Jack Elam, Chill Wills, Slim Pickens, L.Q. Jones, Gene Evans, R.G. Armstrong, they're all here.  (I checked the cast on the second disc which featured a 1988 TCM cut of the film and saw Dub Taylor and Elisha Cook, Jr mentioned.  I did not see them in the 2005 version I watched.)
Also featured briefly are Jason Robards and in an obvious homage to ""The Tall Man,"" the early 1960s western wherein he played Pat Garrett, Barry Sullivan.  (Sullivan played John Chisum, the real-life rancher played by John Wayne in the 1970 western named appropriately ""Chisum"")
Most of the film features Coburn riding into town and running into outlaws that he formerly rode with or other lawmen that were previously outlaws, confronting other outlaws who are friends of Billy and blowing them away.  Everyone knows each other in this film and everyone rode together at some point.  There are two rather sad scenes that reflect this.  In one, Garrett rides into town and gets the tired-out town sheriff, played by the great Slim Pickens, to assist him in confronting some of Billy's buddies.  The sheriff who just wants to retire and sail away in his boat dutifully joins Garrett along with his deputy, also his wife, played by the famous Mexican actress Katy Jurado.  Of course, he gets ""gut-shot"" during the unnecessary confrontation and winds up staring at the water while his lifeblood flows away, his sobbing wife, soon widow, at his side.  There is not a word said and Dylan's ""Knockin on Heaven's Door"" is played in the background.  A very well-done scene.
Like most Peckinpah films, life means very little.  One minute you are alive and the next you're dead.  Another excellent scene reflects this.  A former outlaw, played by the legendary Jack Elam, is deputized by Garrett after knowing him for about one minute.  One night he is eating dinner with a hard-bitten rancher (Gene Evans) and his wife and kids when Billy, who also knows the rancher, stops in for a bite.  He shows Billy the badge and basically realizes that this means his end.  You can see him attempting to think of another way out, rather than the shootout that he has been forced into, without success.  This scene ends the way we expect it to, with Elam also ""knockin on heaven's door"" as  rancher Evans and his family look on impassively.  Like the other, a very affecting scene.
The dvd featured commentary by four Peckinpah scholars.  I did not listen to the commentary although I did hear the same four do the audio commentary on Peckinpah's ""Major Dundee"" and they obviously know what they are talking about.  There is a fairly short interview with Peckinpah's long-time ""companion"" (girlfriend?) and editor.  There is an interview with Kristofferson which I did not watch, (hes never been one of my favorites,) and two songs from him.  There are trailers of other Peckinpah films on dvd and a trailer for a set featuring James Dean's films!  (I'm not sure exactly what he has to do with this film.)
In conclusion, this is a sad, bleak Peckinpah western.  It features the usual amount of Peckinpah bloodshed and a lot of great western character actors.  You may not be smiling when its over but it is still a fairly good film.",1271808000,3,4422,4.685233160621761
398522,3,630197204X,"What to say about this movie?  First, I watched disc 2, the 1988 Turner preview version.  That was more than enough.  I don't claim to be a Peckinpah expert so I'll gladly come at this from a 'non-expert's' point of view - I've only seen two other movies by Peckinpah, Straw Dogs and The Killer Elite, liking the former but not the latter so I know he's capable of films I like and don't like.  I didn't much care for this movie.  I can recognize a certain amount of quality that went into the filming of it but my chief complaint is that it's kind of a boring movie.  On the other hand (or shall we say 'simultaneously'), the scenery is beautiful, yet gritty, and you can see there's a master of the camera at the helm, no argument there. But that's not enough - which brings us to the characters.

How many rock stars can one movie have?  They just needed to get a few guys from ""The Eagles"" or ""The Band"" in there and everything would have been complete!  Robbie Robertson could have played Billy's brother.

But leaving rock stars and long hairs aside, I'm not and never have been a big fan of James Coburn.  Kris Kristofferson didn't do that much for me either.  This movie reeked of the 70s, and I'm not talking about the 1870s.  Seemed like everybody had long hair and looked like they just got finished with Woodstock!  Don't get me wrong, I love this era (the 1970s) and I gravitate towards 70s films as a general rule, but redneck 70s flicks, excuse me, 'westerns' (see ""Outlaw Josie Wales"") are often hit and miss for me.  This one obviously was a miss.

Starts with Pat Garrett catching Billy the Kid, whereon he promptly escapes.  I didn't get that scene - who planted that gun in a newspaper in the outhouse, and how come supervision was so lax?  Hello, beleivability check.  Although, later we glean in the commentaries that that's one account of how it really happened.  Truth being less likely than fiction!

Then the rest of the movie is Pat trying to hunt old Billy down.  Lots of people get shot in between, lots of whiskey gets drunk, there's whores a plenty and a whole lot of chickens get shot - no I'm not talking about the whores - real chickens I mean getting their heads blown off for target practice - that was about the most violent part of this movie.  Sam showing us how tough the world is.  Whatever.  I didn't buy it.  A bunch of redneck 70s machismo.

Dylan was a nice touch.  He played kind of an interesting character in the movie and that and the soundtrack was one of the reasons I bought this in the first place, but I still wouldn't recommend it to the ordinary filmgoer.  If you want an interesting and violent Peckinpah check out Straw Dogs with Dustin Hoffman.  If you want a good western see ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly"" with Clint, or ""Duck, You Sucker"" (aka A Fistful of Dynamite), another Sergio Leone classic which, speak of the devil, also has James Coburn - but is overall a lot more interesting than ""PG and BTK"".

Finally my last complaint is with THE PACKAGING.  THIS MOVIE, AS WITH MANY I'VE BOUGHT FROM AMAZON RECENTLY COMES IN ONE OF THOSE CHEAPLY MAKE PLASTIC SAVING 'ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY' CASES. What a joke.  We're supposed to beleive they're doing this for the environment? They're doing this to save a few bucks on packaging materials. UNFORTUNATELY THESE CASES DON'T PROTECT THE INNER ARTWORK FROM WEAR THAT ACCUMULATES OVER TIME, MOISTURE ETC.  THE RESULT IS INNER INSERT ART THAT IS LESS RESISTANT AND THUS SUFFERS WEAR SOONER THAN TRADITIONAL 'WHOLE CASE' PACKAGING.  I HOPE THIS TREND ENDS SOON. It's ripping off the customer.  Who ever heard of someone wanting to recycle or throw away a DVD case? If I'm going to invest cash in a movie over the price of a rental, obviously I don't plan on throwing away the case.  Why then the move toward these whittled down cases?  Just my ten cents.  The end.

PS. The special features are the best part of this package.  Hearing Kristofferson recount his own beginnings, working with Peckinpah, Dylan, and just the times in general, gave me a whole new respect for the man - plus it was nice to see him outside his role in Peckinpah's vision. It's a real treat to be able to hear these guys talking about it all these years later - this is a very well thought-out and generous feature to this video.  The other featurettes, with the exception of the commentary (where one reviewer dominates too much), are worthwhile as well.",1266451200,8,4440,4.505632040050062

398524,5,630197204X,"Pat Garrett's director cut was the last Western of Sam Peckinpah. In certain way, this entry was an honor debt for this unforgettable. To get close to the most famed duel the West reminded.

The implacable prosecution of Garrett behind Billy's traces, the double moral when Billy reminds Garrett was on the other side of the law. The badge marks the difference.

The script depicts the Faustian attitude of Garrett when he decides to join forces with the Governor and entrepreneurs before the imminent changes to come in the far West. They need security for the investments, and so the pact is done. So, Garrett has signed his own sentence's death when he is ambushed in 1909.

The visual metaphor of the kids playing with in the gibbet and finally when the child throws a stone to Garrett remits us to the key sequence in ""The wild bunch"" , when a childish crowd plays with a scorpion, to emblematize the violent environment. On the other hand, the use of the violence's aesthetic in Peckinpah is now a personal and unsurpassed landmark, so many times imitated but never equaled (Quentin Tarantino has been influenced by Peckinpah, for instance)

James Coburn is over the top as the ruthless Garrett, he lives with astonishing realism every single movement, act or word. He breaths into the personage with such brilliant intensity that it should not surprise us he would be the cynical personage in ""Cross of iron"" from 1976.

398530,4,630197204X,"This is definitely a great western. Although it's a Sam Peckinpah movie and there's a lot of graphic, gory violence, the focus is actually on the acting, which is top-notch all the way around. James Coburn provides one of the all-time great western performances and Kris Kristofferson holds his end up nicely. Sam also collected quite a few familiar faces from the western genre and then gave each of them a showcase - however brief, every portrayal is memorable and excellent. There's a lot of first-rate dialogue but also quite a bit of impressive and effective facial expressions and body language.  The Bob Dylan character is completely superfluous but he doesn't detract from the film at all, which is the best that an amateur actor can hope for. The screenplay itself is leisurely and meandering - a series of superb set pieces instead of a regular story arc. The plot is just a backdrop for Peckinpah's favorite theme of a dying way of life being inexorably and ruthlessly replaced by something much less honorable. This particular old tale long ago passed into legend but Sam P. apparently sticks pretty close to the basic facts and then greatly embellishes the rest for dramatic effect. A few examples are: the two men's original close friendship, Billy's working for John Chisum at one time, Billy's arrest and jailbreak, Pat turning from outlaw to lawman and then hunting Billy down, Pat firing two shots in their final encounter (one in  Billy's heart and the other into a wall), Pat's ambush and murder years later. These were all real events, and a lot of the names and locations used were authentic as well.

Bob Dylan's performance is totally unnecessary but his musical score is superb and adds a lot to the film. Gorgeous folk singer Rita Coolidge, Kris Kristofferson's wife at the time, plays the perfect girlfriend (she never speaks!!! I guess she couldn't do a convincing Mexican accent so Sam kept her character silent) and does a brief nude scene. Too bad she didn't also get to sing on the soundtrack - she was very talented. Wonder whatever became of her?

I remember really liking the theatrical version when it appeared, but the story goes that Sam hated it. So now these two new versions have come out and they both seem pretty close to what I can recall, so I'm not sure what his objections were. I watched them on successive nights and thoroughly enjoyed both of them. Sam died a while ago so I guess we'll never see what he had intended but this result is quite fine, I think. My only complaint is that on Disk 2 (the 1989 Turner Preview Version) the sound goes haywire at the very end after Billy's death scene. Also, Richard Jaeckel appears wearing a very distracting, screamingly obvious, Colonial-era type wig. Why? Were people out west still wearing those things a hundred years after the Revolutionary War? He always was a fine character actor but that wig just called way too much attention to itself.

Anyway, it's a classic western and a fantastic exemplification of Sam Peckinpah's much-loved notion of outlaws outliving their time and being killed because of their refusal to adjust to a changing world.",1228348800,2,3145,4.795202952029521

Peckinpah's West is not a place you would really want to be - particularly if you are a women. Peckinpah's women are passive, abused by the male characters, or just readily available for sexual dalliances.
Bob Dylan's music is a major plus but his presence in the movie is gratuitous as his acting abilities are non-existent. The film also suffers because its themes are no longer fresh having appeared in other (better) Peckinpah films. There are moments of great beauty but this is no masterpiece. Peckinpah buffs will appreciate it more than the casual viewer.",1221868800,,679,4.964912280701754
398556,5,630197204X,"As a film teacher and Peckinpah scholar, I had put together my own cut of this film in the early 90's compiled from several video versions (and the TV version), and showed it in a special class devoted to the film.  As someone who is probably somewhat an expert on this film, I'd like to make a few important points about the two versions included here in this set.

First, the Turner cut (mislabeled ""director's cut"") seemed to be merely a workprint Peckinpah had assembled at one point but was missing several sequences (including the scene with Garrett's wife), seemingly cut out to include in the television print.  I say SEVERAL scenes -- no one, not even the experts (e.g., Seydor, Weddle, Simmons et al) mention the other omitted scenes, not even in their respective studies.  One is a short sequence with Billy bringing a blanket to Maria and then wrestling with the kids (as it cuts right into the chickens continuing the kids' movements). It is in NO print of the film released (beyond the early television showing) -- but I do still have a (poorly dubbed) copy of that scene. It must still exist someplace.  There are other minor tiny sequences (Poe walking down the hall, etc.) that are still missing from these two versions.

My second point, the newly restored 2005 version has an UNFORGIVABLE editing blunder: a wrong shot is inserted when R.G. Armstrong cocks his gun --!!! What happened??? Some editor obviously tripped up and messed up the shot sequence. This totally destroys this great scene which is so electrifying with Armstrong's dialogue and the shocking cocking of his gun.  This NEEDS to be fixed and a newly mastered DVD should replace this edition!  Why doesn't anyone else seem to notice this incompetent blunder? And who's responsible for this?  I'd love to hear Seydor or another Peckinpah expert respond to this!

Also, I believe some of the choices the experts made in reediting the film in the 2005 version (which seems to favor the theatrical print over the ""Turner"" cut) is really debatable.  I would tend to favor including some of what they omitted (like Dub Taylor's sequences) even though they play a little clumsy -- after all, they still reflect elements of Peckinpah's conception. I don't like second-guessing what he ""might have"" cut out later.  And, although I somewhat like the ending to the ""2005"" version (with the kid throwing stones at Garrett and ending on that shot), that is, in my opinion, an act of all-too-much ""rethinking"" the film by others instead of respecting Peckinpah's own vision that I can't help but think is reflected more accurately in the return to the framing story and Garrett's dying (as in the Turner print). Even if perhaps ""less polished"", it does seem very much like Peckinpah.  It's obviously what he wanted!

So it's hard not to come to the conclusion that neither version is completely satisfactory, but of the two the Turner cut is far superior (and, arguably, the only valid cut).  To me perhaps the ideal version would be to try to include all of the shot footage in Turner's version, but to insert the Garrett-Wife scene AND the Billy-bringing-Maria-the-blanket sequences in their proper places (as well as the long prostitute sequence including the Ruthie Lee beginning which is an important sequence).  I would also honor Peckinpah's own adamant decision to leave ""Knocking on Heaven's Door"" OUT of the Baker death scene as he was not ambiguous about his wishes here.  (Who cares if the experts like the song?)  If I were still teaching the Peckinpah class that would be the version I would prefer to screen for the attendees.

All in all, it must be said, however, that this motion picture, in any version, is one of Peckinpah's greatest triumphs and a masterpiece (albeit truncated).  It deserves a wide audience and a future recognition of it as a brilliant classic western for the ages.

I HAVE DELETED HERE A PREVIOUS POSTSCRIPT TO REPLACE IT WITH THE FOLLOWING...

AN IMPORTANT ADDENDUM ADDED ON 5/26/2014:
Paul Seydor is not just a brilliant Peckinpah scholar and writer, he is also a wonderful, generous man. I finally managed to fulfill a dream of mine a few days ago and discuss in depth PG&BTK with him, and the different scenes and versions. Now I realize how much myth and incorrect information has been inadvertently (and sometimes mindlessly) circulated for years. In my classes and online I have always detailed what I believed to be the truth, with a conscientious exactitude, but from the moment of the film's release so much nonsense has been propagated. And a lot of it seems to have been the fault of Peckinpah himself.

One thing I learned from Paul was that many mistakes were made in the editing and sound of the making of the 2005 version after it had left his hands, and one of them was the editing blunder (when R.G. Armstrong is cocking his gun), an inacceptable gaff that I have been, and am still, so upset about -- and justly, I might add.

Because of the bungles and sloppiness the 2005 version displays (such as that sequence), I remain not happy with the 2005 version and still prefer the Turner cut (with the caveat that it needs the Wife and the Ruthie Lee sequences), but now I am confident that every decision Paul Seydor made in forming the 2005 version had a valid reason for it, and was made not only with a respectful restraint, but with wisdom gained from his unsurpassed experience.

Moreover, I am happier still because I know now that he proved to be the erudite, intelligent Peckinpavian expert I had always considered him to be.

My dialogue on this film from now on will be drastically different, and gladly so -- and I eagerly await his upcoming book to garner even more insight into the entire Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid experience.",1220918400,14,5772,4.758517034068136
398557,5,630197204X,"I am giving this movie 5 stars, because the 1988 Turner version is one of the greatest movies ever made.  This is disc 2.  The new re-recut version has some new merits, but overall isn't as good as the Turner version.  The problem with this disc, which is huge, is that there is a flaw on the transfer.  During the last few minutes, the sound is totally whacked.  The Dylan song used just before, and during the end credits is all askew and warped.  I bought this disc and noticed it.  Then I rented it and the same problem was there.  I don't know when, or if, this problem will ever be addressed or fixed.  And I can't seem to find anyone else who mentions it in posts.

It's like if the Mona Lisa had a smashed tomato in the top right corner.  Or someone spray painted their gang symbols on it.  All this emotion, and drama is built up and at the end the flow is cut and lost.  Anyone have any thoughts on this?

398559,5,630197204X,"In matters to taste, so they say, there is no dispute.  No, this film isn't perfect but, in my humble opinion, it is absolutely terrific entertainment.  The sound track and characters are almost all excellent.  Yes, Dylan is somewhat miscast as Homer's Odysseus [Nemo, Nobody] but, heck, with the best of all possible sound tracks, he's earned his place in the film.

The opening scene with Billy and his other Bad Boys shooting the heads off of buried chickens sets the mood for this Peckinpah film.  In his movie 'The Wild Bunch' Peckinpah does much the same thing, as children, who are supposedly not the focus of one of the beginning scenes, stage a fight between ants and a scorpion and then set them all on fire.  Peckinpah has a message and the message was that cruelty and violence are inborn human traits, something he emphasizes in both of these great films.

The characters are to die for.  Kristopherson, Chill Wills, Slim Pickens, Katy Jurado, and James Coburn put in wonderfully idiosyncratic performances.  There are numerous memorable scenes...the surrendering Billy holding his arms out like the crucified Christ; Chill Wills recounting the attributes of a local puta; gut-shot Slim Pickens and his heart-stricken wife, Katy Jurado;  Garret [Coburn] shooting Billy and, with his second bullet, shooting his own reflection in a mirror.

398562,5,630197204X,"Have I seen a film that possesses more beautiful cinematography than ""Pat Garrett and Billie the Kid?  I think not.  This 1973 Western, represents in my opinion, one of the finest films of it's genre (""The Searchers"", ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"", ""Shane"", ""High Noon"", ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"", ""Once Upon A Time in the Old West"", ""The Unforgiven"", and Peckinpaugh's ""The Wild Bunch"", quickly come to mind as well).  It's interesting to note about what happened right after this film was completed.  The movie's production company MGM, went behind Sam's back and vastly re-edited the film.  This not only angered the actors and the crew (especially old Sam!) who quickly divorced themselves from this doctored miscreation, but it also was panned by most critics and ended up bombing at the box office (can you say Karma?).  However, in 1988, the film was re-released as Peckinpaugh's director's cut, and now is considered by many critics as a misunderstood and mistreated masterpiece.  It is definitely one of my top three favorites of all his great work and right behind ""Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia"" as his most underrated film.

The story takes place in New Mexico in the late 1800's.  James Coburn stars as the aging, ex-gunslinger Pat Garrett and boy is he exceptional,  I don't think I've seen him better.  Garrett, the town's new sheriff and a former pal of Billie the Kid (Kris Kristofferson), is given the unenviable task of having to drive 'the Kid' out of town or possibly having to do away with his old pal for good.  The two old friends have taken completely different paths in life since their earlier days.  Garrett has mellowed and matured as most men do with age and the added wisdom that usually goes with it, while 'the Kid', well... let's just say he's still 'the Kid' - an immature, hedonistic gangster.  What unfolds for us, the audience, is a fascinating, complicated, character study of a flawed man (Garrett) who is aging as quickly as the Old West itself.  Sheriff Pat in many ways feels as if he himself has sold out, and is doing everything he can to avoid his and 'the Kid's' tragic and unavoidable fate.  For in destroying 'the Kid', he is essentially destroying an important part of himself.

Everything works in this fine film.  Sam's directing has never been more sophisticated and stylish, aided by cinematographer John Coquillon (also with Sam on ""Straw Dogs""), they were able to show the West in some of the most colorful, captivating ways ever captured in the history of American cinema.  It's as if almost every other scene is a painting, a picturesque work of art that leaves one breathless for more.  When you combine the vibrant, colorful scenery of the Old West (the New Mexico landscape is simply sublime!) with great acting, excellent, mature writing, and Bob Dylan's (who also does some acting in this one) seductive soundtrack what you get is, in my humble opinion, one of the most visually stunning motion pictures I can ever recall seeing.

A fine cast, which of course you expect with a Peckinpaugh film, features some great character actors - Slim Pickens, Jack Elam, Harry Dean Stanton, Richard Jaeckel, Chill Willis, Katy Jurado, etc... along with Rita Coolidge and a cameo appearance by the great Jason Robards as Governor Lew Wallace -  who all turn in excellent performances, particularly Elam, Pickens, and Jurado.  The latter two actors take part in a scene that tugs at my heartstrings and leaves me completely awe-struck every time I view it.  It is to this day, my favorite scene in movie history.  I won't divulge the details in order to not spoil any of the story, but let's just say that when you hear the song ""Knockin' on Heaven's Door"" by Dylan you'll know what I am referring to.  One of the only movie scenes that actually brought tears to my eyes when I first saw it and still does to this day.

It's all subjective, but I absolutely adore this one and I sincerely hope you do to.

Garrett being the newly appointed sheriff is told to get rid of The Kid.  Billy has no such plans on leaving, which forces Garrett to chase him down and realize the awful possibility that he may very well have to put The Kid down for good.  The two men have aged since the good old days and each have taken a different path.  Billy refuses to grow up and wishes to do as he pleases.  Garrett has grown up, but in the process has betrayed everything he ever was.  This all leads to a very problematic situation for the two and the way it all hammers out in the end is bound to stay with you for a few hours, if not a few days.

Sam Peckinpah's ""Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid"" was a complete joy to watch for me.  It is a Western and there is action and gunfights, but that's not what drives the movie.  What drives the movie are these very real characters who are extremely flawed and aren't always exactly sure of what the next move is going to be.  No matter who the character is, you see them as a real fleshed out person.  James Coburn gives a masterful performance as ""Pat Garrett"" and is even more menacing at times when he's simply saying nothing at all.  Kris Kristofferson makes you like and sympathize with ""The Kid"" even though he's a murdering outlaw who wouldn't hesitate spraying bullets at anybody who dares to stand in his way.  As surprising as it sounds, Bob Dylan also gives a great performance in the film as well (not to mention a very cool score and soundtrack).

I have to say I'm relieved that I checked out the reviews for the movie after I was done watching it, because the version I watched was the ""2005 Special Edition,"" assuming that it was the better of the two.  I was under the impression that the ""Turner Preview Version"" would be chopped up and watered down.  This was not the case as I would soon learn from the reviews, which seemed to praise the ""Turner Preview Version"" over the new fully restored one.  So, I watched that version shortly after and I have to agree with the masses.  While it is a few minutes longer and the pace may seem a tad slower, this version to me felt like it was the way the movie should be shown.  I never saw ""Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid"" being an action-extravaganza flick, and even though in the notes the director said he wanted ""a mix of fury and elegy,"" the ""fury"" he was referring to didn't necessarily have to mean more action.  The fury to me in this movie comes from the deep personal conflicts that these two characters struggle with, particularly Garrett.

The downside of the ""Turner Preview Version"" is that it isn't cleaned up like the restored one.  I don't believe it's even anamorphic.  Now, this would sound like a tragedy, but in a weird way I think it kind of adds more of an authentic look to the movie.  It's supposed to be rough and rugged, unclean and distorted.  Not to say I wouldn't be happy with a more cleaned up presentation of this version of the movie, but either way this is the one that I feel is superior.  At least they gave us both versions instead of just going with the ""2005 Special Edition.""  THAT would've been a tragedy.  The DVDs includes commentary and a few featurettes.

A word of caution; the back of the box can be misleading as it says the film is 237 minutes long.  This worried me at first because I thought I'd have to spread it over a day or two, and ended up being shocked when it was over.  The 237 minutes refers to how long both movies are added together.  The movies are a little over two hours long.

Whether you prefer the ""2005 Special Edition"" or the ""Turner Preview Version,"" this is a movie that shouldn't be missed, and you don't necessarily have to be a fan of Westerns to take a liking to ""Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid.""  If you're a fan of great acting and complex characters, then this is something I recommend seeing, even if only once.  It's quickly become a new favorite of mine, and I will continue to watch it for many, many years.  -Michael Crane",1184025600,15,4428,4.275240384615385
398601,5,630197204X,"Here's my favorite Peckinpah. I'm throwing my two-bits to the 1988 version, which is slower, more elegaic, quietly building power. Dylan's words over Slim Pickens' death scene make that moment too literal in the 2005 edition, the words repeating what we know (it's a great song on its own, separated from the scene). The 2005 version re-edits the scene of Garrett and the prostitutes in a heavy-handed, PC way, and snips out a great image of one of the women staring hard into the face of the uptight marshal (where we're trusted to draw our own conclusions). The film gains enormously from the drained color of the 1988 version, presenting a gray world of desolate choices between one kind of death and another. With the color re-saturated in the 2005 edition, the film tends toward a naturalistic western, which is not in keeping with the ennervated, intangible feeling of the violence. Plus the 2005 cut deletes the line Pat Garrett says to the marshal at the end, ""What you want, and what you get, are two different things."" The way that line is said makes it just as compelling as the more famous one from ""Ride the High Country,"" ""I just want to enter my house justified.""

On its own, I did like the added scene of Garrett at home with his wife. In a minute or two you could get a whole picture of their marriage. But, even so, I didn't feel it was necessary to the film; you can surmise without it that Garrett has sought respectability by settling down, the kind of woman he would marry and the degree of honor (albeit his womanizing) he would bring to that pact. It is still a very good scene, it makes all those qualities particular, but in my view it does not justify re-editing the film or really belong with the mood and structure of the whole. It could have made an extra instead.",1176163200,6,1795,4.523076923076923

Kristofferson was very young in this part and fairly inexperienced as an actor but it doesn't show one bit. The costumes and the period are portrayed perfectly. The characters are dirty, crash, and wild. There are many colorful characters portrayed by a lot of famous character actors that you have probably seen in a ton of movies. Slim Pickens is also here in a brief but memorable role. The Kid and Garretts friendship is what holds the movie together and even though they don't show their early outlaw years together they don't have to.

398605,4,630197204X,"Peckinpah's ""Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid"" is a rich, haunting, yet demanding work that, above everything else, sees Billy as a creature of his day and age...

He is by no means made a wholly sympathetic character, but who was sympathetic in the New Mexico of 1881? Peckinpah has most of his characters dyed with violence and sniffing the prevailing air of corruption--the chief protagonists, their filthy henchmen, even the onlookers...

Where and what is the law? No one seems to know or care... Garrett and Billy have seen both sides, like almost everyone else...

And among the confusion and violence that is the legacy of range war there is no gleam of purifying light in the efforts we see being made to clean up the territory... The powers that be want Billy out of New Mexico, not for ethical reasons, but rather so that things can be neatly protected for the approaching business exploitation...

Garrett is the man made sheriff to hunt him down and thereby the man who compromises . . . 'This country's getting older and I aim to grow old with it ... there's an age in a man's life when he has to consider what's going to happen next.'

But Billy can't compromise... It's not his way... ""Billy, they don't like you to be so free!"" proclaims the Bob Dylan theme song, summing up why the power men find Billy so irritating... Perhaps that's why Garrett who has sold out to power is in some ways a reluctant hunter... He salutes Billy's spirit--his very own personal declaration of independence--but he knows it's not the spirit of the new times...

It says much for Peckinpah's way with actors that he gets such admirable performances out of the comparatively inexperienced Kris Kristofferson, as Billy, and Bob Dylan, as Billy's mate... It says just as much for his Westerns perceptiveness that he relies even more heavily on experience... The well-tried James Coburn is both solid and hard to define as Garrett... And then there are the others who know their way around Westerns so well--Katy Jurado, Slim Pickens, R. G. Armstrong, Jason Robards, Jack Elam, Chill Wills... There's not a single performance here that isn't a rounded-off portrait in its own right...

It all adds up to a richness in characterization that is matched by the richness of marvelously composed scenes in which interiors and exteriors alike have been put together with loving care and attention to detail, whether it's a big set-piece 'shoot-up' or a close-up of a can of preserves--how such a can looked in 1881...

Garrett's hunt for Billy is told mainly in set-pieces and it has to be said that Peckinpah makes little narrative concession to an audience in the way they are strung together... But for the out and out Western fan this is a most memorable movie...",1162944000,6,2752,4.766806722689076
398606,5,630197204X,"I am very conflicted in praise for this special edition.

First of all does the ""special edition"" hurt the film? It doesn't. It does a service to the muddled theatrical cut (which Peckinpah did have a hand in). It is a tighter film & the best things about the film are still there. I would gladly go back & forth between this version & Peckinpah's Director's Cut. But let's be honest, and I'm speaking mainly to the Peckinpah ""experts"" on the DVD; whether some people want to admit it or not, the Peckinpah Cut Is the Director's Cut. Whoever heard of this ""preview version"" nonsense before this came along? Why would he show it to people over the years without apology for it? It is the closest thing we will ever get to his cut. Like it or not.

And that version is essential viewing. I feel even more so than the special version. The pace is slower yes, but that is part of the film's style. There is a sadness more evident in the longer cut that is still in the special edition, but harder to see. I don't think Peckinpah was going for something subtle here. And certain lines of dialogue from this version will also be missed by those who grew used to Sam's Cut all these years.

The unfortunate thing, that brings back the controversy of the film's handling, is how the ""preview cut"" was handled. It's not as cleaned up as the ""special edition"" & it even has skips in the film. Plus, if they could put the scenes with Garrett's wife & Ruthie Lee back in the special cut, why couldn't they put them back in Sam's cut too(They were taken from that cut to be put in the TV version because so much was edited from it)?

The irony is that Paul Seydor & Co., while being of the best intentions, are no better than the MGM executives that helped damage one of the great films of our time. If you listen to the commentary, Seydor pretty much confesses that it was done the way HE always thought it should be done. While I don't think his version is bad by any means, I don't think his reasonings were grounds enough to tamper with the film. I will give him one shout out for not taking the Paco sequence out. It obviously pained him to leave it in.

Either way though, this film is worth having. It's the reason repeated viewings were made.  The performances are just right (Even Dylan isn't so bad. He's not so good either, but he's no Keanu Reeves) & scene after scene is brilliant. This is a film that you won't be able to get out of your mind.

398638,5,630197204X,"Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid is one of the darkest of films; death and loss seem to pervade every scene.  The film mourns the death of the western film (it is the last great western), the end of the frontier period, and is the last film of many western actors.

The film resonates with references.  For example, the scene in the film of the arrest of William Bonney at an abandoned house at Stinking Springs on 23 December 1880 by Sheriff Pat Garrett (James Coburn) is one case in point.  William Bonney (Kris Kristofferson) surrenders with arms outstretched, rather than vertical, in a posture similar to that of Christ on the cross.  This is must be a reference to the fact that in the same year of 1880 saw the publication of Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ by the Governor of the territory of New Mexico, General Lew Wallace, and cannot be a coincidence.

The Lincoln County War had only taken up part of the Governor's time: and the literary thoughts of the Governor are reflected in the scene where Pat Garrett meets the Governor (played by Jason Robards).",1154217600,3,1061,4.528795811518324
398639,5,630197204X,"Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid is a famously flawed classic. Like so many of Peckinpah's films, its theme is the death of the Wild West, as the wide open, lawless anarchy that drew a breed of rough individualist to it succumbs to civilization and corrupt big money interests. Pat and Billy were both part of that lawless breed, and the film is a tragic tale of the doomed ways they both try to cope with the changing West - Pat by trying to adapt to the new order, and Billy by trying to ignore it altogether. The film dispensed with using a typical narrative story arc and the traditional Western dichotomy of good guy/bad guy, in an attempt to reach to a higher level of art than is often associated with the genre. Despite some missteps and obvious flaws, it very nearly succeeds in this attempt, and in its best moments, approaches being a tragedy of Greek or Shakespearean proportions.

When taken as a whole, this film has its share of flaws. Yet some of the vignettes within it are as perfect and amazing as anything ever set to celluloid. First among them is the scene where Sheriff Garrett (James Colburn) and Sheriff Baker (Slim Pickens) go gunning for Garrett's old riding buddy Black Harris (L.Q. Jones). As Garrett engages in a melancholy showdown with his own wild past, Pickens' gut-shot Sheriff Baker wanders off for the greatest death scene since Hamlet, all to the strains of Dylan's Knocking on Heaven's Door. Also note-worthy is the pistol duel between Billy (Kris Kristofferson) and Alamosa Bill (Jack Elam), a scene that blends comedic and tragic elements better than any other I've ever seen. These two are simply representative of many more powerfully perfect scenes that make this movie outstanding.

Peckinpah collected a powerful cast for his film. Colburn is perfect as Garrett, the tired old outlaw turned Sheriff, and Kristofferson brings a certain lan to the role of Billy. The cast of character actors here who play the side roles are virtually a who's who of  Western film history - Slim Pickens, Jack Elam, L.Q. Jones, Harry Dean Stanton, Chill Wills,  Matt Clark, R.G. Armstrong, and Dub Taylor (though his scene is cut from the superior special edition). Bob Dylan made his film debut here as the enigmatic Alias, and so long as he didn't have too many lines he acquitted himself reasonably well.

The two disc special edition DVD release is a worthy package for this classic film. It contains two different cuts of the film - the Turner edition, sometimes erroneously called the director's cut, and a special edition new cut that attempts to approximate the director's original vision. Both are worth watching, and each contains scenes missing from the other. The commentary tracks are a mixed bag. After five minutes of listening to the commentary on the special edition cut, I couldn't take any more of the overly pedantic blather and turned it off. The same Peckinpah scholars do the commentary on the Turner edition cut, and though also pedantic, I was able to slog through it and to gain some useful information from it. If you don't have patients for academic pretensions, don't bother with these tracks, but if you really want to get deeper into Peckinpah's art, they do have some value. Other special features of note are the short feature, One foot in the Groove, which is an interview with Kris Kristofferson and Donnie Frits sharing their remembrances of Sam Peckinpah, and a small treasure - Kristofferson singing One for the Money: Sam's Song - a brilliant Kristofferson penned tribute to his friend Peckinpah. Also included in the features are a film gallery of trailers from five Peckinpah movies, and a piece on the troubled history of the making of Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid, which has little appeal unless you are a hardcore film student. Altogether, it is fine packaging for an outstanding film that I highly recommend.

398640,3,630197204X,"There seems to be a lasting discussion, or even a consensus, about why this movie is flawed in one way or the other and worse than the Wild Bunch, especially amongst US audience. A discussion I frankly can't quite follow even though it is belabored at considerable length in the commentary tracks. The issue apparently also motivated Mr. Seydor to throw together a so called 'special edition' with scenes taken from either the Turner version or the theatrical release, in an attempt to produce a version he feels Sam Peckinpah might had been striving for, given the troubled production circumstances. This 'special edition' is the one version coming with this package, and if you are like me you might consider this wasted space, as at least I'm not at all interested in what Mr. Seydor feels might be great. The idleness of this whole attempt is mirrored in the commentary tracks, where most of the time is wasted with repeated explanations about what a directors cut and a fine cut are, why the theatrical release is more of the latter and the directors cut is flawed in various respects etcetera etcetera, in an obvious, lengthy and tiresome attempt to justify that very 'special edition'. Thoroughly painful to listen to, and I had rather watched the theatrical release and judged for myself. Something Mr. Seydor and his production staff apparently think I am resp. we are not able to, or else they simply would have included the theatrical release and spared us their cut.

That said, the other version coming with this package is the Turner version, also known as the director's cut, and it's a blessing this version is finally available on DVD. In spite of all the blabber about supposed flaws this movie is a true classic. The story, the core of which is the conflict Garrett's going through, most of the acting, production design and score are outstanding. The story alone could have carried the whole movie with ease, but on top of this it's loaded with gems not found elsewhere. Anyone appreciating e.g. the jailhouse sequence, it's dialogue, Ollinger's character and his peculiarities, the wonderfully bleak production design and ingenious pace leading to a unique climax, making it an almost complete story within the story, knows what I'm talking about - sheer poetry, profoundly entertaining sarcastic humor and an incredible bunch of talent assembled into a unique masterpiece.

I remember seeing this on t.v. back on July 26, 1980.  I was getting married that day and was apparently anxious about the day.  I tried watching this and having a drink to try to relax before the 6 pm ceremony.  I couldn't concentrate on the movie then, and I thought it was because I was reoccupied with getting married.  I was wrong.  I just bought this on cd and it's a bad film.  The story DRAGGGGGggggssss.  The acting is very stilted and stiff. Kris Kristofferson couldn't act his way out of a wet paper bag.  Coburn is fair but he is surrounded by mediocrity.  It is interesting and entertaining to a limited degree to see some old faces having cameo appearances but their parts are extremely limited and incidental to the overall effect.  As for Bob Dylan, he is actually good as Alias, but the Alias character is truly lame and also incidental.  The movie isn't historically accurate either.  I would recommend just about anything other western over this as your time would be better spent.  If you like Peckinpah, try Junior Bonner.  It's a great film with a good story and character depth.  Try anything John Wayne did or Burt Lancaster for that matter.

An iconoclastic 70's neo-western about rebels, fearturing rebels, directed by a rebel. The spirit of the New Mexican Territories, circa the turn of the 20th century, full of lawlessness and giant personalities, as well as relentless death, is lead by Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid, practically brothers, or father/son, they cut a swath through the real and the legendary (during their lives) until one became the hunter, the other hunted. Metaphorically, the times are changing, and someone must recognize that change. Someone won't. So goes the simple story of Pat Garrett, one time outlaw, now sheriff, and Billy the Kid, ever the iracible outlaw, even if his onetime ""father"" figure, running mate, and friend is hunting him down. Oh, and Bob Dylan is in it and scored it. Oh, and there are awesome character actors throughout, the lifetime credits of whom probably total more than a thousand films and t.v. episodes.

398647,5,630197204X,"Historically, it would be easy to go on and on about PAT GARRETT AND BILLY THE KID.  Much has been made of this Old West legend -- the stuff of great American myth, and, while this story has been given ample screen time in several different films, the reality of history's two more notorious outlaws finding themselves at opposing sides of the law could easily serve as fuel for many more interpretations.  Cinematically, the film is breathtaking, painting an incredible vivid and intimate story of these two men on a Whiskey-stained, blood-splattered canvass as vast as the Old West.  Artistically, one could argue the merits of this individual film against similar Westerns or even just the notable niche of Sam Peckinpah's Westerns, and you'd have one heckuva essay ... and one heckuva time figuring out which you like most.

For me, PAT GARRETT & BILLY THE KID is tops, all around.  (I'm writing this review shortly after viewing it for my first time now that it's available on home DVD, and I can say it easily ranks as one of my top ten Westerns -- if not top ten personal favorite films -- of all time.)  The performances are terrific with James Coburn as Pat Garrett taking the top spot, but Kris Kristofferson holds fairly equal ground -- though less cowboy bluster -- than Coburn.  The script by Rudy Wurlitzer is terrific who tracks great miles out of this most unique relationship.  And the most credit has to go to Peckinpah, who brings it all together in one cohesive mix, guns blazin'.

The film also boasts a young Bob Dylan in his first screen performance, and, while much has been made of his contributions to the picture in several other online reviews I've read from film critics and historians, he's mostly a blip who blends in ... just like the character he plays.

If the film suffers from any weakness (and it's largely forgettable), it's the music, also penned by Dylan.  (I say this, though, never having been much of a Dylan fan, so take that as you like.)  There are moments -- most of them thankfully early in the film -- where the music just doesn't seem right -- dare I say a bit too folksy for my tastes ... yet the balance is that when Dylan hits the note perfectly as he does with any variation of his ""Knockin' On Heaven's Door,"" it fits brilliantly.  I guess, in the end, there's acceptable balance.

Strap on them guns, boys and girls, and experience the Wild West the way it was meant.",1139356800,5,2423,4.578703703703703
398668,5,630197204X,"I have waited a long time for this classic movie, one of my favourites, to appear on dvd. I saw the original theatrical version when it came out, and then the Turner preview version. Now comes this one. I don't have access to Sam Peckinpah's thoughts on the new version, so I have no opinion on whether this was the version he would have chosen, but it is certainly my favourite (so far - maybe there's another version hanging around??). The commentary on both versions - the 1988 Turner preview and the 2005 version - are well worth listening to.

The only omission I regretted from the new version was the line from Chill Wills about what his ""woe-man"" was prepared to do with cowboy boots. The editors admitted they didn't understand it - they confuse it with some joke once made by Earl Butz which got him the sack from the Ford cabinet back in 1975, but it's much filthier than that joke. I think this is a commendable commentary on the editors' minds, as it is is one of the filthiest lines I have heard in cinema, but missing it out from the new version detracts from the obscenely humorous passage. Perhaps, it's best to keep your mind as clean as the 2005 editors by not thinking about the meaning of that line...

You can also argue about whether the Dylan vocals of Knocking on Heaven's Door should have been added. Perhaps this is personal taste, but I was glad the 2005 editors did.

Generally, the new version is tighter in focus. The main changes were very good. A scene about Garrett's wife was added, showing how artificial and dead was Garrett's new life of respectability. He prefers to have his sex with [scarlet women]. There is the added scene with the whore Ruthie Lee, which is abusive and violent - a needed counterpoint to Billy's more sensual sexuality, and crucial to the story line too. Importantly, the raft scene - where Garrett and a family man on a raft decide not to kill each other, a striking few minutes - is rightly brought forward in the movie to integrate it with the character study which is the essence of this film.

Pat Garrett is the centre of the film, not Billy. If The Wild Bunch is about men getting old and being pushed to the margins of an advancing civilisation before being destroyed, this film is about a man who surrenders to civilisation. He is not going to get destroyed, so he sides with the money-powers which he hates but knows are too powerful to defeat. The slow degradation of character which results from his decision to kill his own youth makes this movie genuinely mesmerising - truly great art. The fact that Garrett is going to be killed by those powers anyway heightens the sense of tragedy, and this role must be one of Coburn's greatest feats of acting.

And what a great decision to end the movie not with Garrett's death, but with the boy throwing stones at him as he rides out - the look in Garrett's whole body indicating that he agrees with the boy. What a movie...the editors cannot be thanked enough.",1138579200,7,2978,4.507407407407407
398669,4,630197204X,"""Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid"" is perhaps the quintessential flawed masterpiece.  It's rich, haunting, frustrating, beautiful to look at, and totally unlike anything else, not just in Sam Peckinpah's output but in the entire history of the Western.  There are scenes that don't quite work and others that never could have worked, and one in particular that is as bad as anything Peckinpah ever committed to film.  But I gladly overlook these shortcomings every time I view the film; indeed, as Peckinpah biographer David Weddle argues in the commentary included on this DVD, even the movie's flaws somehow contribute to its cumulative effect.  Someone once remarked that if Antonioni had ever made a Western, it would have resembled ""Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid."" I would add that if Herman Melville had been a film director, his work might have looked a lot like this.

This new, long overdue DVD release shows what a remarkable film this truly is.  The prints of both versions included are gorgeous, despite a few scratches and other flaws. Visually this is perhaps Peckinpah's most beautfiul film, and thanks to the excellent widescreen transfers we can now fully appreciate Ted Haworth's superb production design and the stunning cinematography of John Coquillon.  Coquillon is a somewhat overlooked figure in the Peckinpah universe; he was Peckinpah's most frequent director of photography after the much more celebrated Lucien Ballard, yet his work for Sam is scarcely ever discussed.  It is surely noteworthy that Peckinpah chose Coquillon for this film, even though Ballard had photographed nearly all of his other westerns.  Perhaps this was just a matter of scheduling, but whatever the reason, Coquillon's sombre, moody style -- worlds removed from the more radiant, romantic quality of Ballard's work in ""The Wild Bunch"" -- fits this material perfectly.

The DVD package gives us two versions of the film, both with good commentary tracks featuring Peckinpah experts Garner Simmons, Paul Seydor, and David Weddle.  First, it contains the famous ""Turner Preview"" version, first shown in 1988 and available for years on VHS.  This version is often billed as the ""director's cut"" and is indeed thought to be nearly identical to the version which Peckinpah kept in his private collection and periodically screened for friends and colleagues.  Apparently the one difference between Peckinpah's copy and the Turner Preview is the curious omission, in the latter version, of a brief but important scene between Pat Garrett and his wife.  (This scene has since been rediscovered, and is included in the other cut of the film presented in this set.)

However, as Paul Seydor (himself an editor) points out in the commentary, the term ""director's cut"" is misleading.  Even with the missing wife scene restored, he says, the Turner Preview version cannot be said to represent Peckinpah's final cut of the film.  It was at best, Seydor says, a preliminary cut, which as a matter of standard practice would have undergone a great deal of trimming and tuning to produce a ""fine cut.""  I'm not sure I agree with this assessment: the Turner preview looks to me like a very highly polished cut, even if the editing is a little slack at times.  But it may well be that Peckinpah would have further trimmed the film, had he been allowed to see it through to completion; instead, as is well known, MGM took the film away from him, and he bitterly disavowed the version released in theaters in 1973.

Which brings us to the other version included in this set: the 2005 Special Edition.  The packaging for the ""Sam Peckinpah's Legendary Westerns"" boxed set makes the fraudulent claim that this version is ""reconstructed from Peckinpah's notes""; the packaging for the indivdual DVD softens this stance a bit, stating instead that the new version is ""based on the director's notes and insights from colleagues""; and the commentary makes no mention of these notes whatsoever.

In fact, the 2005 Special Edition was prepared by Paul Seydor and Nick Redman, and anyone who has read Seydor's book (which is superb, by the way) will know exactly what to expect.  Seydor has long held that while the Turner Preview preserves much more of Peckinpah's vision than the original theatrical release, it compromises his artistry because many scenes are left in need of further refinement -- not through any lack of judgment on the part of Peckinpah or his editors, but for the simple reason that the version we know as the Turner Preview is not, nor was it ever intended to be, a fine cut.  The original theatrical release, by comparison, was fine-cut, brilliantly, by Peckinpah's editors, but almost twenty minutes of footage were removed, including some vital material.  The 2005 Special Edition, then, represents Seydor's attempt to give us the best of both worlds.  In cases where a scene is common to both the theatrical version and the Turner Preview, he has tended, with one or two exceptions, to use the theatrical cut.  All but one of the extra scenes in the Turner Preview are included, as are the missing scene with Garrett's wife and a brief but noteworthy scene between Garrett and the prostitute Ruthie Lee that was previously only available in the theatrical version.

The 2005 Special Edition therefore consists almost entirely of material prepared by Peckinpah and his editors.  The one unavoidable exception is the opening sequence, where Seydor combined the tighter theatrical cut of the first scene in 1881 with his own tightening of the 1909 framing sequence omitted from the original theatrical release.  From a critical standpoint, I think Seydor made largely the right choices; for me, his only mistake was favoring the theatrical version of Slim Pickens' death scene (the version with Bob Dylan singing ""Knockin' on Heaven's Door"" on the soundtrack) over the more subdued version (no singing) in the Turner Preview.  Seydor has also, to his credit, resisted the presumably overwhelming temptation to remove Emilio Fernandez's two scenes as Billy's friend Paco; both scenes, in particular Paco's death, are utterly atrocious, and the film would unquestionably be better off without them.  But this is Peckinpah's film, not Paul Seydor's, and Seydor wisely leaves these scenes in.  He does permit himself to omit one scene that had been in the Turner Preview: a scene in an outpost where John Beck accosts Elisha Cook Jr., Dub Taylor, and David Levy.  In the commentary, Seydor argues convincingly that Peckinpah probably would have removed the scene himself; it's the only one in the film in which neither Garrett nor Billy the Kid appears, and it's a pretty weak scene besides.  I can't object too much to Seydor's decision to omit it, especially given his good taste and restraint in all other aspects.

Overall, I think the 2005 Special Edition is probably the best available version of the film, but I am a little uncomfortable with Seydor's insistence, again and again, that the material drawn from the theatrical cut was prepared by ""Sam and his editors."" As David Weddle's biography of Peckinpah tells the story, MGM took the film away from Peckinpah and essentially blackmailed his team of editors into helping them cut the film (the studio hired another team of editors to prepare a drastically shortened version and threatened to release that one unless Peckinpah's team agreed to help the studio).  According to Weddle's account, far from collaborating with his editors on the theatrical cut, Peckinpah was barred from the editing room, and moreover regarded his team's continued work on the film as a betrayal!  Perhaps Seydor is afraid others will share that view, which might explain why he works so hard to make the case that the theatrical cut was prepared with Sam's blessing.  But methinks he doth protest too much.  The efforts of Roger Spottiswoode, Robert Wolfe, and their colleagues to prepare the theatrical version were in no way a betrayal of Peckinpah or his work.  It was a heroic, if in the end a doomed, effort to save as much of Sam's vision as they could, while always maintaining the highest possible level of artistry.  These men knew Sam's work and were in sympathy with him artistically, and to me their motives are beyond reproach.  (They received little enough thanks from Sam for their efforts; indeed, things ended so acrimoniously that neither Spottiswoode nor Wolfe would ever work with Peckinpah again.) For me, the knowledge of these men's loyalty to Peckinpah, combined with the reality that nearly all of the scenes common to both versions do, in fact, play better in the theatrical cut than in the Turner preview, is justification enough for Seydor's undertaking.

As I've said, the 2005 Special Edition is probably the most successful cut of the film available.  Still, I cannot understand why the crucial scene between Garrett and his wife was not restored to the Turner Preview version.  This would have allowed viewers to see the exact version of the film that Peckinpah himself kept and screened for others, and also would have given Seydor a chance to set right what Turner botched back in 1988.  The only reason I can see for leaving it out is that the marketing people would no longer have been able to bill the longer cut as the ""Turner Preview,"" but why be concerned about the integrity of a version that was only ever accepted faute de mieux, especially when you have the opportunity to present the ONLY cut of the film for which Peckinpah himself was ever willing to claim responsibility?

Another disappointment is the set's feeble assortment of extra features.  The two commentary tracks, as I've said, are very good.  Apart from that, though, all we get are a couple of rambling and rather slapdash featurettes (one intercutting footage of Paul Seydor rehashing information from the commentary tracks with the reminiscences of Peckinpah's assistant and sometime lover Katy Haber, and another with Kris Kristofferson and Donnie Fritts), a handful of Peckinpah trailers, and Kristofferson performing a couple of songs relating to his experiences with Peckinpah.  Not exactly an embarrassment of riches.  (There is also, for some unknown reason, a ""James Dean trailer"" on one of the menus, but I didn't even bother looking at it.)

""Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid"" is a great, unforgettable film, but it will always be a problematic one.  This DVD release is in most respects all one could have hoped for, but it is not without one or two problems of its own.  Perhaps this is as it should be; after all, as Pat Garrett says (at least in the Turner Preview), ""what you want and what you get are two different things.""  In this case, though, we can at least be thankful that what we do get is so very, very good.",1138406400,16,10771,4.973244147157191
398670,5,630197204X,"There've probably been as many movies about Billy the Kid as there have been about Jesse James. But this one has to be the best one I've ever seen.(Although I do like Young Guns)

  I bought this film soley on the basis of director Sam Peckinpah's work on ""The Wild Bunch"".I've never seen the movie before. And after watching it. The film is phenominal.

  Like most all of Peckinpah's films,it deals with changing times and how old codes of conduct and honor soon become obsolete. In this case,it's the friendship of Pat Garrett (James Coburn) and Billy the Kid (singer Kris Kristofferson in his acting debut,I think).The film takes place after the Lincoln County Cattle War that made the Kid famous. In the aftermath,the new govenor,General Lew Wallace (played by Jason Robards) and the powerful businessmen like cattle baron John Chisum decide that there is no room for Billy the Kid in the ""new"" west. So they hire Billy's best friend,Pat,to hunt down the Kid. The film examines how Pat's decision to become the sherriff tears apart his relationship,not just with Billy,but with everyone else who believes he's selling out to the powerful. The sad thing is,Pat knows it too. And he hates himself for it....You can see it clearly in James Coburn's sad blue eyes. But Pat knows the world is changing...and he must change with it to survive. But Billy knows that too...yet he refuses to see the end coming. Life is just one big game to him...one he's gonna lose.

  Although Kris Kristofferson captures the strange mix of joy and sociopathic maniac that defined the Kid,he is a little too subdued at times. One of the film's saving graces is it's strong storytelling and great cast including western character actors like Slim Pickens,Jack Elam,R.G. Armstrong,Matt Clark,and Harry Dean Stanton. Oh,yeah.....Folk Rock legend Bob Dylan makes his film debut as Billy's tight-lipped companion Alias. All in all,if you love westerns...this is a must have movie.",1138233600,,1957,4.960244648318043
398671,5,630197204X,"First, I'm very grateful that my favorite Peckinpah film, and one of my top two favorites (McCabe & Mrs. Miller being the other) has finally found its way onto DVD, with that format's possibilities.  As the film is famous for having never attained a state satisfactory to the filmmaker, this double-disc release offers a special, new cut, that is an attempt both to rectify perceived shortcomings, and retain strengths from the original theatrical release, and the 1988 ""Turner"" edition.

I have to say the results are mixed. Since Peckinpah has been gone for some time, any new version obviously cannot be claimed as Sam's vision, but is a product of someone else's perceptions of what works, and what doesn't. Not everyone is going to agree with each choice that has been made.  I certainly don't, though the commentary track provides the reasons for each decision well enough.

Those familiar with both earlier versions know that the Turner edition added the ""framing"" footage of Garrett's assassination, intercut with Billy and the gang shooting up chickens years earlier.  The guy who put the 2005 version together starts out with the odd choice to use both the ""frame"" footage, and the theatrical version's montage credit sequence.  Both had their advantages, but I think the framing material was more effective intercut with the main credits.  Worse, however, for me anyway, is the fact that the guy admits to favoring the theatrical

version, leading to worse choices later on -  the dropping of the the other ""bookend"" frame for one.  I don't agree with his reason either, it isn't just a pointless replay of the same footage, but a reminder of Garrett's fate, and an opportunity to create another nifty editing image (Billy shooting Garrett).  Always liked that bit.

For some reason, the Turner edition featured a rather muted musical score, and no Dylan vocals!  This new cut corrects that, and also restores the long-lost scene between Garrett and his wife.  The commentators do a nice job also of pointing out some of the film's ""uncorrectable"" flaws, particularly the underdeveloped (and perhaps unneeded) storyline featuring the Paco character (it's funny to hear them crack up when Billy just up an leaves the raped girl crying over her murdered father, to ride off amongst sheep).

The new version also drops the scene with Poe interrogating the miners, which is defensible, as it keeps the focus on Billy and Garrett, although that scene has some nice dialogue of weariness and despair (""Tired of looking fer yellow rocks"").  I prefer the extended scene with Peckinpah at the end - I thought he did a nice job there, no reason to cut it short as in the new version, and the theatical cut. The commentators also explain the differences between a ""director's cut,"" a ""preview cut,"" and a ""fine cut"" which is what the new version kind of tries to be.

Mostly, the new version falters at the end, I think.  The guy apparently hated the ""What you want and what you get"" line, and so left it out, as well as dropping the second occurance of the framing story. That's too bad.  I thought the line gave the scene a dramatic pitch that is otherwise lacking, as well as several layers of meaning to consider. And I just don't agree with him about which ending is best.

But, thankfully we have the Turner version included in the package, so Peckinpah fans can see the stuff they like.  What this DVD finally shows is that we'll simply never have a ""definitive"" PG&BtK.  Despite these reservations, we do get a terrific film in a beautiful widescreen print.  That alone is something to savor, and celebrate.",1138147200,4,3615,4.842276422764227

The film alludes to their past friendship but little light is shed on it's true nature.  Billy is treated as something of a folk hero because supposedly he is a thorn in the side of the land barons but that theme isn't really elaborated on.  Sam Peckinpah employs his trademark slo-mo bloodshed but it doesn't have the resonance that it did in film's like ""The Wild Bunch"".  Bob Dylan, who does contribute a superb soundtrack, gives an inert performance as an actor.  His high point is reading the labels on food cans.  Rita Coolidge, Kristofferson's then wife, breaks form and shares his bed.  I watched the director's cut without seeing the truncated or expanded editions of the film.

I'm very much looking forward to this restored edition as I am the other Peckinpah films which are finally getting their day in the sun.  Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid is a unique film in many ways, not only for Coburn and Kristofferson's memorable portrayals, but for the numerous cameos and Bob Dylan's musical score, not to mention guest appearance.  Peckinpah stretches beyond his nihilistic bounds and finds plenty of humor in the situations he sets up.  Kristofferson gives Billy the Kid a playful turn without losing sight of the pathos of his character, coming the closest to capturing this enigmatic Western icon.  But, it is Coburn's take on Pat Garrett that really stands out, playing the rogue marshall to dead pan perfection, in many ways signaling an end to an era -- not only in the mythical lawless nature of the West, but the Western movie genre as well.",1134432000,5,985,4.670520231213873
398674,5,630197204X,"I agree fully with everything Olga, the previous reviewer, says about Peckinpah's terrific film, with one exception.  I do not regard Bob Dylan's participation in the film as unfortunate.  Dylan's acting, while certainly limited, never detracts or draws attention from the essence of any scene, and his musical score is brilliant, augmenting Peckinpah's atmospheric camera work perfectly.  The difficulties the producers had in working with Dylan on the film have been well documented, and I don't dispute those.  I can only say that I love the work that resulted.  Dylan had great respect for Peckinpah and his methods, though he had little patience for the way great movies are made, and he had downright disgust, as Peckinpah did, for the more commercial vicissitudes of Hollywood.

Yes, the Wild Bunch is great too in its own respect, but I give the edge to this film.  I never grow tired of watching it.  Certainly it is at least one of the all time great westerns.",1131235200,19,970,4.9079754601226995
398675,5,630197204X,"Peckinpah's tenth film, eighth western, and the movie he wanted to be remembered by before a record total of six editors at MGM cut it to ribbons. A deceptively rambling, elegaic Western in the classic Peckinpah style, ""Pat Garrett"" distinguishes itself from all other film versions of the Billy the Kid story (around forty) through its beautiful, azure blue-tinted, unabashed fatalism, which never grows tiresome.  On the contrary, although on the surface Peckinpah's film seems to be a series of cowboy cameos strung together by several exemplary set pieces filled with trademark slow-motion violence, it is never less than absolutely riveting.  Billy's run  from Pat across a lake drenched in soft dusk light, Slim Picken's inevitable death set to ""Knockin on Heaven's Door"", and Garrett smoking a cigar out on Billy's porch, waiting for him to finish making love before he kills him, are as indelible an image as any Monumuent Valley action sequence from a John Ford western.

  Peckinpah also had the sense to keep up to date with the times in which he lived. Therefore, it seems to be no mistake that Billy (as played by Kris Kristofferson) seems as much like a 60's counterculture rock god as well as an Old West outlaw and that Bob Dylan (unfortunately) appears in the film. With the advent of the ""ME"" generation of the 70's, however, even a counterculture heroes' pool of popularity was drying up.  Similarly, the forces of civilization, capitalism, and big business have destroyed the vestiges of a free landscape for both Pat and Billy, except that Pat is willing to conform.  Similarities to ""The Wild Bunch"" are only surface-deep.  We can see that Peckinpah envisioned this film entirely differently, with results that can stand behind  Ford's ""The Searchers"", Howard Hawks'""Rio Bravo"", Anthony Mann's ""Man of the West"", and ""The Wild Bunch"".  Arguable the greatest western ever made.",1130889600,28,1898,5.070739549839228
398676,3,630197204X,"I saw this movie many years ago, in the non-director's cut.  So much to like, the gritty realism, the shades-of-gray nihilism that separates the law from the outlaw, as well as the strong acting of James Coburn and Kris Kristofferson.  Oh, and that beautiful, sad, soundtrack written and performed by Bob Dylan.  Even his acting was half inarticulate, half art.  However, the editing and flow of scenes was so choppy as to border on incoherent.  A local video store still had the video copy of the Director's Cut, so I recently rented it to see if the new edit improved this film.  Unfortunately, it did not.  In fact, some scenes were arguably made worse.  This is still a muddled mess.

After the initial setup of who Pat Garrett and William Bonney were, the movie lapses into a muddled series of scenes where sometimes we don't know who is who, where we are, and where we are going.  Two of the worst include the scene in the bar where Pat has Alias take away the barkeep's shotgun and pull his hat over his head, then read off the labels on the cans on the shelf while Pat plays cards with the other henchman.  The other is when the John Beck character (Poe) shakes down the doddering old ranchhands for information about Billy the Kid.  Why would they all of a sudden talk, and give factual information?  And why, after telling the ranch-interest toadies where they can stick their advance on the reward, does Pat allow Poe along, even after Poe admits to Pat over a campfire that his loyalties are not with him?

Oh, by the way, Jason Robards is playing some relatively obscure general, the military governor of the New Mexico territory, not any general you might know.  I only figured that out in the following scenes, and checking the credits.

The first of the two scenes arguably made worse in the Director's Cut was when Billy escapes and turns the sadistic deputy's shotgun (wadded with half a roll of dimes) on him.  I recall the slow-motion of the devastating coin shrapnel shooting out of the shotgun to be more drawn out in the original version.  The second is the death scene of the Slim Pickens character (Sheriff Baker).  The best song on the soundtrack (""Knockin' on Heaven's Door"") is truncated, and the lyrics removed, in this version.

The final indignity suffered by the audience is that Mr. Coburn's distinctive and gritty voice has been so overexposed from his work doing Chevy Truck commercials, that when Pat Garrett rounds up the posse to go after Billy, you almost expect him to round the corner and jump in a Blazer or Tahoe.

Unless there is yet another Director's Cut awaiting release on DVD, the flaws in this one are probably why the studio may view a new release as unmarketable.

*** UPDATE ***

I quickly snapped up the new 2-disc special edition on DVD when it was finally released.  I almost wonder if the studio read some of these reviews, including my own, as many of the weak points of the Director's Cut have finally been fixed.  For example, the illogical scene with Poe interrogating the miners was cut, and the Slim Pickens death scene has the Bob Dylan lyrics restored.  And of course, the scene with Pat and his wife finally syncs up the best available current version with most of Peckinpah's choices in his unreleased, personal cut of the film.

Helping this new DVD edition along is the quality of the print, which is nearly scratchless with perfectly realistic colors.  A character study film with lots of closeups of gritty, real-life characters filmed in natural light is going to be demanding on the accurate rendition of flesh tones, and the DVD does not disappoint in this regard.

Still a flawed masterpiece, but much improved, and arguably the truest to Peckinpah's original vision.",1120521600,8,3742,4.687595712098009

Peckinpah's ""Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid"" is the most realistic, yet beautifully poetic western ever made.  Few people acknowledge the historical accuracy of this film.  I have read the historical accounts of ""the Kid's"" last days, and most scenes- and some of the dialogue- are taken directly from history.  Yet the true magic of this film comes from the heartbreakingly beautiful sense of melancholy that permeates the film, from the exquisite cinematography of the New Mexican landscape, right through the characters, who realize that the American frontier has at last bumped up against the Pacific Ocean. The wild and wooly times, and the people who lived through them, are fading fast with the light of day.  The veteran western actors in the film, one and all, give the most heartfelt performances of their careers, sensing as they did, that the golden days of the genre they'd loved and nurtured were as doomed as the characters they portrayed.  Add to that one of the most haunting soundtracks ever recorded (and one of Bob Dylans finest works), and you end up with a true American classic.  Peckinpah's masterpiece.

Bob Dylan's ""Alias"" role serves as a manifestation of Billy's ""inner voice,"" the spirit of unspoiled New Mexico, and as well the personification of the rebellious youth of the 60s and 70s; all three are destined for a broken heart. Watch this film and you will love it. At its end, you will probably have an unjustifiable admiration for the real William Bonney.

398718,4,630197204X,"Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid is another great Sam Peckinpah western that needs to be released on DVD as he originally intended it.  The title characters, Pat and Billy, are old friends but in 1881 in New Mexico they find themselves on opposite sides of the law.  A group of rich cattle barons/land owners hires Pat Garrett as sheriff to hunt down and kill his friend and outlaw Billy the Kid who has been rustling cattle.  Just like Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch, this movie deals with the changing times of the west; Garrett tries to change with the times while Billy refuses to change for anyone.  Peckinpah takes his time with the movie as the story just ambles along until the climax.  The movie features plenty of balletic, slow-motion violence that Peckinpah has become famous for.  Bob Dylan's soundtrack is pretty good, but it seems out of place at certain points.  Either way, this is an another excellent movie from Bloody Sam that western fans will appreciate.

  James Coburn and Kris Kristofferson are excellent in the title roles as Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid.  Coburn brings a great amount of world-weariness as Garrett while Kristofferson gives Billy a human side in a part that could have been nothing more than a stereotype.  Singer Bob Dylan is surprisingly good as Alias, a mysterious gunfighter who serves as a go-between with Pat and Billy.  The supporting cast is an impressive collection of western character actors including Chill Wills, Jack Elam, Slim Pickens, Richard Jaeckel, Luke Askew, Jason Robards, RG Armstrong, Emilio Fernandez, Paul Fix, Harry Dean Stanton, and Gene Evans.  This VHS is the original uncut version that Peckinpah originally intended so if you can get your hands on a copy, take it.  Beware of the VHS release that cut twenty minutes for time.  Hopefully, a widescreen, Director's Cut DVD is released in the near future.

Far from ""detracting"" from the film,as a few of the critics have indicated, Dylan's score added to the drama immensely. Just the fact that Dylan created the entire score and wrote his ever haunting Knocking on Heaven's Door for this film makes it worthy of being offered in DVD format.

It's a touching, beautiful scene.

""PG and BTK"" is worth it just to see Slim die and hear Dylan sing, but it has other assets also, especially the long, loving scene of Kris Kristofferson and Rita Coolidge which leads into the final confrontation between the film's two anti-heroes. There's an epic, otherwordly quality to Peckinpah's movies and this is one of the most original westerns ever made.

398721,5,630197204X,"Movies, especially genre pieces, are rarely unique; so one has to look at this film as a magnificent achievement, if only for its extraordinary originality and the manner in which it achieves that originality without demolishing the Western genre.  Unlike Sergio Leone, who signaled his love of the genre even as he deconstructed it; PAT GARRETT AND BILLY THE KID seems to spontaneously erupt out of Peckinpah's unconcious.  I don't think he ever made a film before or after which speaks so effortlessly and so beautifully in the voice of its author.  The result is a Western which is not only unlike any other Western ever made, but completely unlike any other film ever made, including Peckinpah's own.

Firstly, this film moves in an entirely unique manner, avoiding the three-act structure of the conventional film in favor of a cyclical arc which inexorably propels the film towards its violent climax.  The film, quite literally, ends where it begins, both chronologically and geographically.  Secondly, the film's dialogue is simply extraordinary.  Screenwriter Rudy Wurlitzer (most probably in collaboration with Peckinpah) invents a patois which, for all intents and purposes, amounts to an artificial period dialect.  The film essentially invents its own language.  This, combined with John Coquillon's bleached-tan cinematography, creates a world so self contained that one begins to understand how its inexorable forces push against its characters, rendering them helpless before their fates.

This is also, without question, a masterpiece of acting on the part of James Coburn.  His performance ranks with John Wayne's Ethan Edwards in THE SEARCHERS as a towering pice of film acting.  Coburn's Garrett is a weak-willed yet ferociously tough outlaw who is smart enough to realize that the outlaw's time is almost over; like Pike Bishop in THE WILD BUNCH, he wants to start thinking beyond his guns, because those days are closing fast.  Indeed, the darkness is closing on everyone in this film.  Its characers seem to appear like memories, ciphers out of a dream.  They are lost souls who history has abandoned, and are left only with their fading memories of the West when it, and they, were once young.  Coburn captures Garrett's tragedy, the tragedy of a man who cannot avoid his fate and yet fights desperately to do just that, in a performance of marvelous economy and subtlety.  He barely raises his voice until the film's final moments, and yet one can almost see the forces tearing him apart inside.  There are a handful of moments where this humanity bursts through to the surface - when he watches, with a look of pity and compassion, as the gutshot Sheriff Baker wanders to the river to die, his weeping wife silently at his side; or when he almost shoots a perfect stranger on a riverboat and suddenly realizes the absurdity of what he is about to do; or, most especially, the split second look in his eyes the moment before he pulls the trigger and kills Billy the Kid, a look halfway between weeping and despair - and these moments are marked by Peckinpah's unrelenting camera as beautifully as John Ford's shattering closeups of Wayne's face, contorted by rage and sorrow, in THE SEARCHERS.

The rest of the cast, while not as magnificent as Coburn, nonetheless provide an extraordinary array of grotesque and tragic characters, simultaneously ugly and unforgettable.  Kris Kristofferson's Billy is essentially a child, incapable of seeing or understanding the forces with which Garrett is reckoning.  He too cannot escape them, yet he has no conciousness of his own doom.

The films' elegiac sense of inevitability is underlined by the presence of a myriad of aging Western actors: Chill Wills, the extraordinary Katy Juarado, and, most especially, Jack Elam, who turns in a shockingly moving performance as Alamosa Bill Kermit.  It is simply astonishing to think that the man who played a monosyllabic thug in the opening scenes of ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST has here been transformed into the sad, good-hearted old man doomed by merely being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Peckinpah's skill with actors is rarely mentioned, even by his supporters, but it must be noted that the performances in this film (many by non-actors) are, even in the smaller parts, universally moving and memorable.

The Bob Dylan soundtrack, often cited by the film's detractors, is also quite unique.  Like Curtis Mayfield's soundtrack to SUPERFLY, the soundtrack does not enhance the film so much as add another dimension to it, acting less like accompaniment and more like a chorus keeping watch over the proceedings and signaling to us the complexities its characters cannot grasp.  More than anything else in the film, Dylan's score provides the sense of tragedy and loss, the tear-jerking inevitability of the passage of time, which raises this film out of its genre origins into the realm of cinematic poetry.  (Legend has it that when Dylan first played Peckinpah the film's signature theme ""Billy"", the icon of cinematic machismo - who had no idea who Dylan was - was reduced to tears, blubbering ""goddamit, who is that boy?  Sign him up!"")

A word has to be said here about PAT GARRETT AND BILLY THE KID's place in the history of the Western.  It is, in my opinion, THE oustanding masterpiece of the later Westerns; begun by John Ford himself in THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE and culminating in Clint Eastwood's UNFORGIVEN; an era in which the Western was looked at for the first time in a concious manner and its conventions were subverted and, ultimately, re-mythologized.  This film must stand alongside ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST as one of the most extraordinary reimaginings of the Western ever put on film; but whereas Leone's film is an operatic fantasy, Peckinpah's film is a dusty folk song, an elegiac, late-evening ballad laced, perhaps, with a bit too much Mexican tequila but, nonetheless, suffused with that sense of sadness and loss that has marked all the great Westerns of its era.  It is a film whose violence, dirtiness, and occasional sadism only underline its wounded heart, the heart of its director, who loved the Western and its conventions even as he blasted them to pieces in slow motion.  Peckinpah might have occasionally reveled in blood, but there was method in his sadism, perhaps summed up in the line of one his characters, who only wanted to enter his house justified.  None of the characters in PAT GARRETT AND BILLY THE KID can hope for such a consummation, but the same cannot be said of its creator.  Whatever accolades may yet come Peckinpah's way, and he is long overdue for a reassessment, this film proves that every one of them is, unquestionably, justified.

*This review refers to the long version of the film, included on the second disk of this DVD package.  The new Special Edition, while interesting, is ill considered in my view.  The added scenes are superfluous and the trimming removes some of the films best lines and disturbs its measured pace.  Quite frankly, it plays like a two hour preview.  The reconstruction seems to have been done by people seeking to impose their own ideas of what Peckinpah intended rather than allowing the longer version to stand on its own.  While it is true that, given the abscense of its creator, there is and can be no truly definitive version of this film, the longer version is, in my view, clearly the masterpiece its shorter counterpart is not.  A wounded masterpiece, perhaps, but even wounded masterpieces are, generally speaking, better left alone.",1095033600,183,7576,4.9604430379746836

398724,5,630197204X,"Few directors have understood the Western genre quite as well as Sam Peckingpah, and although ""Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid"" may not be his best Western, it is still an extraordinary achievement.  The film is based on the events leading up to the death of the famed outlaw Billy the Kid (Kris  Kristofferson) by his former friend turned lawman, Pat Garrett (James Coburn).  Although the outlaw's story has been told and retold in countless other movies, none of them are quite as striking as in Peckinpah's unique version.
One of the first things that struck me about the film is the realistic way the characters are depicted.  In most traditional Westerns, the concepts of good and evil are fairly clear-cut and easily recognizable.  There's the handsome Western hero (usually represented as a lawman), fighting for justice and order against the violent forces of evil (usually represented by outlaws or bloodthirsty Indians).  But in this film these concepts are not so neatly drawn.  Garrett, for example, pursues Billy the Kid, not necessary out of a sense of justice, but simply because it's his job.  When asked why he took the job to begin with, Garrett simply states: ""A man gets to an age where he don't want to spend time figuring what comes next.""  And Billy the Kid, despite being an ""outlaw"" and clearly prone to violence, as when he breaks out of jail and kills two deputies in the process, is contrasted with his good qualities, particular his likeable charm and loyalty to friends.  At one point, Cattle Baron John Chisum (memorably played by Barry Sullivan) asks Garrett almost regretfully, ""Are you going to get him?""  He echoes what many in the film seem to feel, namely that the Kid may be an outlaw, but he's still one of the most interesting people in the territory.
This is also one of Peckinpah's finest looking films. The cinematography of John Coquillon is excellent.  I also love Bob Dylan's beautiful acoustical soundtrack (my only regret is that in this version, we don't actually hear Dylan sing ""Knockin' On Heaven's Door"" as we did in the orignal theatrical cut).  Another joy of the film is the excellent cast made up of veteran Western character actors, such as Chill Wills, Jack Elam, and Slim Pickens.  And James Coburn gives one of his best low-key performances as Garrett.  Even Bob Dylan is effective as ""Alias"", who serves as a link between the two principals. Another fascinating aspect of the film is its lyrical quality. I recall one critic saying it had the pacing of a campfire ballad with each vignette like a verse.
The Director's Cut of ""Pat Garrett"" is a big improvement over the original theatrical version which had been cut drastically by  MGM when it first appeared in 1973.  This version is still missing an important scene between Garrett and his wife (which actually appeared in television prints of the film).  However,  the movie appears close to what Peckinpah originally intented.  The laser disc release was letter boxed.  Unfortunately, the VHS version is not, nor is the picture quality as crisp or as detailed as the disc.  We can only hope that someday MGM will see fit to release this remarkable film on DVD.",1067990400,6,3173,4.81549815498155

398746,5,630197204X,"Not having seen this in 30 years, I ordered from Amazon with distant memories of the original cut.  While still having Peckinpah's caricature style of sideline characters, which is engaging, this cut is terrific in giving what I imagine is a more in depth unvarnished look at the turn of the century rural West.  While in real life most accounts depict Billy the Kid as unequivocally evil, this film takes license and uses him as a set up for the moral ambivilance of conflict---class, race, wealth, old vs. new.  But, in this cut, is the Slim Pickens death scene cut back dramatically from the original.  I believe so, and if correct that's a drawback because the original may have been a tearjerker, but it was great.",1049068800,2,719,4.682539682539683
398747,5,630197204X,"When Sam Peckinpah gets mentioned, it's usually for films like ""The Wild Bunch"" and ""...Alfredo Garcia"".  Those are both fine films, but this one never seems to get a lot of press.  Maybe because he put too many musicians in it.  Maybe people didn't like Bob Dylan in it, or his soundtrack.  Maybe they thought of it as by this time, just another violent Western where we know what the ending will be.
But I think this is a great film, populated by very good actors, with very good performances, and yes, I like the music.  Once again, we have a movie where the main characters are bad guys, even though society considers some of them good guys.  Even though the good guys use bad guy tactics to get the bad guys.  Sound confusing.  Yep.  But from what I know of history, there was a very thin line between those trying to ""civilize"" the frontier, and those just trying to party hard.
Yes, Billy the Kid was a bad guy, and the movie makes no bones about it.  The man has no moral confusion about killing at the drop of the hat, but as it turns, out, it's pride and arrogance that kills him.  Kris Kristofferson may not show that much charisma (he shows a lot more these days), it's the bland expression that makes the killer in him more chilling.
Kristofferson aside, just about the entire cast portrays the rough and tumble Old West very well.  James Coburn gives one of his best performances as Pat Garrett, portraying the weariness of showing not only that he's been through the mill, but the hypocrisy of killing for the ""good guys"" now.  And the death scene of Slim Pickens with ""that song"" playing is extremely moving.
Now for Bob Dylan.  First remember that ""that song"" is ""Knockin' on Heaven's Door"", and even if you hate the movie, this song has become a classic, and this is the movie it came from.  As for the performance, he does stand out, if only because it's one of the few movies to actually see what is an otherwise fairly reclusive famous person.  But because he's Bob Dylan, I guess they had to make him somewhat of an oddball, although far from uninteresting.  It's too bad he didn't give an acting career more chances, for a true challenge of these skills would have been to see if he could portray a ""normal"" person.",1043452800,5,2238,4.446078431372549

398749,4,630197204X,"I love this movie. Always have. I saw it first in the theaters, maybe 1971 or 72.  Sam Peckinpah was already a legend with his ""Wild Bunch"".  Adding Bob Dylan (the man and his music)to this classic western drama was a brilliant move.  James Coburn and Kris Kristofferson are outstanding, and the whole gang of country-looking characters Sam rounded up.  Some of them were musicians who'd worked with Kris as a music star in his own right, so the movie has the feel of an extremely well-done music video.
  One of my favorite scenes was using the Dylan song ""Knockin of Heaven's Door"" during an emotional scene following a gunfight.  I've always felt that that combination of movie and music was a GREAT moment, even though the song was cut to one verse and one chorus.  So, here comes the ""director's cut"" video release, extra footage and all.  I think, wow, maybe the whole song, maybe more, who knows.

This is a startling contrast to James Coburn who injects the character of Pat Garratt with charm and menace in equal measure. He dominates the screen when he is on, and when he is not, the film suffers accordingly. This is a shame as the film is a two hander and demands an actor to equal Coburn's calibre to play the part of Billy the Kid. The young Clint Eastwood would have been perfect. The music is nothing special, either, and I speak as a big, big fan of Bob Dylan. Soundtracks just weren't Dylan's bag. Ry Cooder would have done a much better job.

398753,5,630197204X,"NOTE: This review, dated March 11, 2014, applies to the 2-DVD Special Edition of this movie that was released in 2005.

Perhaps the darkest, tragic, and fatigue-ridden of any Western ever made, director Sam Peckinpah's 1973 opus PAT GARRETT AND BILLY THE KID is also one of the most complicated films of any kind ever made, not only as a film itself but also in how it came into being, and perhaps the fact that it even managed to do so.  Peckinpah had always been fascinated by this ultimate Old West legend; and when he prepared to do the film in the late summer of 1972, he had every intention of making this a film that, even if it didn't match the scope and intensity of his 1969 masterpiece THE WILD BUNCH, would certainly come close.

Sadly, however, when he made this for MGM, he ran into an autocratic studio chieftain named James Aubrey, whose trip was to basically deform (if not outright destroy) films in the name of the almighty box office dollar.  Though Peckinpah did make a so-called ""Director's Cut"" of the film  (really the one he was obligated to show to the studio for preview ten weeks after he had finished filming) that, when it eventually got released in VHS form in the early 1990s, ran 122 minutes long, this was not at all the version that MGM showed to moviegoers in 1973.  That version was some seventeen minutes shorter, and not only did it eliminate a lot of nuances that were important to Peckinpah, it also seemed to accentuate that element of the director that made him so controversial: the violence.  And then in 2005, there came a 2-DVD Special Edition, prepared by Paul Seydor, author of ""Peckinpah: The Western Films, A Reconsideration"" (one of three essential books on the maverick movie maker), with a newer 115-minute version that combines the best of both versions.  Seydor also provides some of the audio commentary on both DVDs, along with three other Peckinpah authorities: moderator Nick Redman; Garner Simmons (author of ""Peckinpah: A Portrait In Montage""); and David Weddle (author of ""If They Move, Kill `Em: The Life And Times Of Sam Peckinpah"").

Understandably, people are going to argue endlessly over this 2-DVD release, especially since certain scenes in the Director's Cut are shortened or eliminated in the revised version.  There are, undoubtedly, a couple of flaws inherent in either version of the film, and yet they actually seemed to feed into its cumulative power.  And in the end, the essential integrity of the film remains intact, as it should, with the focus being on the final three months of the life of notorious 1880s New Mexico outlaw William Bonney (played here by Kris Kristofferson), and how Pat Garrett (James Coburn), his longtime friend, is forced by the emerging powers in the New Mexico political structure to track down and kill him.  Both Coburn and Kristofferson, under Peckinpah's solid direction (even under a miasma of technical problems, influenza, and such while making the film on location in Durango, Mexico in the winter of 1972-73), give superb performances as two old friends now forced onto a collision course with one another that will climax in the darkened house of Pete Maxwell at Old Fort Sumner.  What we have here in PAT GARRETT is essentially a unique pursuit story, because it is about a man who doesn't want to run (Kristofferson) being pursued by another man, a former friend (Coburn), who doesn't relish the idea of catching him.  The story itself is pulled along by a series of vignettes and tragic encounters with former friends that end in gunfire and killing, right up to the bitter end.

Undoubtedly, PAT GARRETT is a stately, leisurely film in terms of tempo and pacing, especially compared to the kinetic energy of THE WILD BUNCH and the director's great 1972 crime thriller THE GETAWAY.  But a patient viewing of this film will reveal that this is a deliberate thing on the part of Peckinpah.  His focus is on characters, plot, and the essential underlying elements, how what happened in New Mexico in 1881 has parallels to what was going on in America at the time of this film's release (the bitter end of the war in Vietnam, and the emerging Watergate scandal).  To this, Peckinpah peppered the film with a large cast of actors that are very closely related to the Western genre, and oftentimes with the director himself (though some of their scenes, again, are trimmed in the 2005 version): R.G. Armstrong; L.Q. Jones; Matt Clark; Jorge Russek; Emilio Fernandez; Chill Willis; Barry Sullivan; John Beck; Elisha Cook Jr.; Katy Jurado; Slim Pickens; John Davis Chandler; Luke Askew; Richard Jaeckel; Richard Bright; Jack Dodson; and Dub Taylor.  And then there's Bob Dylan, who, in addition to having a minor but pivotal role as Alias, also provides the rustic Americana score of the film, including the immortal ""Knockin' On Heaven's Door.""  Topping off things is the traditional Peckinpah editing style set forth by his principal editors Roger Spottiswoode, Garth Craven, and Robert Wolfe, and the burnished cinematography of English cameraman John Coquillon, who had worked well with Peckinpah on his disturbing 1971 horror classic STRAW DOGS.

The most important addition that was made in the 2005 version is a scene that was not included in either the ""Director's Cut"" (strangely enough)  or the 1973 theatrical release: a scene in the first quarter of the movie between Coburn and his Mexican-born wife (Aurora Clavel) in which Coburn is revealed to be a man at odds with himself in carrying out his job, and how he has failed her as a husband.  This scene is not only pivotal to his character and the film's plot, it also serves to put the lie to the overblown notion of Peckinpah being a condescending misogynist and fascist (even though he did have issues with women in his personal life).

If one is willing to concentrate on it as a totality, rather than being bothered by the measured pacing, and will observe that Peckinpah does not glorify the violence in it (and he never has in any of his films), PAT GARRETT AND BILLY THE KID is an engrossing look at a part of American history and legend that is as vivid as anything we've got today.  That's what really great filmmaking is all about.",996624000,4,6219,4.816901408450704

I watched the movie three times and still never heard Bob *SING*  ""Knockin' on Heaven's Door.""

398765,4,630197204X,"Maybe Peckinpah and screenwriter Rudy Wurlitzer work far too self consciously hard at creating a contemporary (for 1973) spin on the gunfighter myth. Maybe too, Peckinpah focused far too much on creating a mood piece through music, photography, staging and obscure dialouge and forgot the narrative. And maybe, Peckinpah's considerable talents were beginning to erode from the constant flow of Tequila that ran over his lips. Certainly, MGM hadn't a clue of what do make of this film when they first released it which accounts for the literal butchery and burial this film suffered in its initial release.
No matter though, Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid, although not for all tastes, is a sadly overlooked near-classic in desperate need of an audience.
Firstly the score by Bob Dylan (I'll say nothing of his poor excuse for a screen performance), is mythic, romantic, pensive and sublime. It really represents some of his best instrumental work. Coupled with Peckinpah's uncanny sense of staging, the music paints a complete image of a time that never was.
The cinematography looks like a classic painting brought to life. Filled with autumnal colors and plenty of magic hour sunsets washing across the scene, this film is breathtakingly beautiful to look at. Several frames could stand on their own as photographic works of art.
Peckinpah always knew how to stage a scene. His use of the actor's face and sense of casting works miracles here. Taking virtually every surviving Western character actor, Peckinpah lovingly frames them against the dying light of day. Slim Pickens, Chill Willis, Harry Dean Stanton, Luke Askew and Jack Elam all have glorious road maps that speak volumes. Through economy (it really is suprising, considering his reputation, how tastefull, whimsical, romantic and sentimental Peckinpah was!) of movement and gesture, ""Bloody Sam"" brings Mount Rushmore to life.
The film unspools at a leisurely pace (and in some ways, that is a kind anaylisis) and many scenes fail to fully develop, but for those souls who enjoy texture and mood for their own sake as well as enjoying a rich western mythic dream, Pat Garrett and Billy The Kid is well worth your time.",986947200,27,2183,5.066666666666666
398766,4,630197204X,"A much underrated movie from Sam Peckinpah...I haven't seen the shorter theatrical release, just the 122-minute version, which critics seem to think is the better of the two.  The pacing is slow and deliberate, typical  for Peckinpah.  Scenes unfold in the characters' own time.  They aren't  hurried.  If you're expecting the sort of sustained tension you get from a  typical western, forget it.  This movie movies along at a gritty, searching  pace.
The movie examines friendship and moral ambiguity.  Kristofferson  is Billy the Kid, and Coburn Pat Garrett, his ex-buddy and partner in  crime.  Coburn has turned lawman, not because he has repented, but because  times are changing, and he doesn't want to be at the losing end of the  fight when the tides turn on outlaws.  His new position as lawman requires  him to hunt down his old friend The Kid. Kristofferson and Coburn are great  in the lead roles.  Coburn, in fact, is perfect at Pat Garrett, and as good  as he has ever been.
There are some pretty gruesome scenes in this  movie, not the least of which is one in which Billy and the gang half-bury  chickens and blow them away for target practice (it is rather reminiscent  of the children/scorpion scene in The Wild Bunch). There is something about  this scene that is even more disturbing than the man-to-man shoot-'em-ups.
What Bob Dylan is doing in this movie is anybody's guess.  His acting is  terrible. Scenes between Kristofferson and then-wife Rita Coolidge are  terrible, too.  Mercifully, their screen time is minimal, and their spoken  lines few. (Dylan is in one amusing scene, in which Garrett makes him read  out loud the labels on all the cans on a grocery shelf while he  interrogates one of the Kid's other cronies...you have to see it to  appreciate it.)",964051200,7,1786,4.8305647840531565

Kris Kristofferson plays  Billy, James Coburn plays sheriff Pat Garrett, and, in the best role I've  ever seen him in (in fact, I've never seen him in anything else, come to  think of it), Bob Dylan plays a character who recurs throughout the movie,  called 'Alias,' who is very handy with a knife.

The theme is that the  West is changing, and there is no room anymore for the wild, carefree  violence and the gunslinging cattle wars.  Law and order have taken over at  last.  Garrett sees the trend of the future, and changes, becoming the  sheriff.  Billy refuses, maintaining his old ways, with the predictable  result.

History aside (any resemblance to actual historical events is  purely coincidental) this is a great movie.

I particularly liked the  scene in which Jack Elam, who had crossed the Kid, meets his doom.  They  are on neutral ground, eating dinner in a mutual friend's ranchhouse, and  it is obvious that they will have to shoot it out after dinner.  Jack Elam,  with a doleful expression, asks for ""another piece of that fried  pie.""  In the face-off which follows dinnner, knowing that the Kid is  faster, instead of waiting for the count of ten to turn and fire, Elam  turns early, only to be shot by the Kid...who had anticipated the move, and  turned earlier still.

This is a good one.  I loved it.  Probably you  will, too.

398768,5,630197204X,"This is one of the best westerns made during the last 30 years.  It's in the same league as ""The Wild Bunch,"" ""The Outlaw Josey Wales,"" ""The Shootist,"" and ""Tombstone.""
This is  the most accurate of the Billy the Kid movies.  The only drawback was that  the real Kid was only 21 when he was killed, while Kris Kristofferson was  in his mid-30s when this movie came out.  However, that does not take  anything away from his outstanding performance.  James Coburn also gives a  very good performance as Pat Garrett.
Bob Dylan's soundtrack is  outstanding, especially the opening music and The Cantina Theme, played  during the scene where Garrett tells Billy that he's the new sheriff.
In  all, a very great western.",955324800,8,714,4.762295081967213

398770,5,630197204X,"...in fact it's my personal favorite.  Slow and majestic, yet gritty and tough with plenty to say about how the times were/are a-changin' (there's certainly parallels to be drawn with Peckinpah and the studio system).  This director's cut is an improvement in many ways over the  studio-butchered original, but, sadly, we do lose the scene where Slim  Pickens' character dies to the soundtrack of Dylan's ""Knockin' on  Heaven's Door"".  A pity.
Dylan, by the way, gives an enjoyably  eccentric (Chaplinesque?) performance, but the real stars here are  Kristofferson and Coburn (which, as they're playing the title roles, is as  it should be).  Both are first class.
Highlights include the Kid singing  to the townsfolk of Lincoln after he's tricked the guards, and the scene  where Garrett makes Alias read out the labels of a whole shelf of canned  goods.  And the inevitable finale still manages to be wonderful  cinema.
""What you want and what you get are two different  things!"" - Well, Peckinpah certainly found that out when the film was  first released, but this cut is something else.  Rent or buy as soon as you  can.",952992000,30,1125,4.919786096256685
398771,5,630197204X,"Thsi film is perhaps unlike any other that I know. It has a scale and a sense of nostalgic loss for old values that could almost make a grown man cry, a rich sense of humour and characters played with real depth and ease.  It's loose and far less stlyised than Leone's movies, less ham all over,  but Coburn and Kristopherson give great, subtle performances. Violent,  stylish but above all romantic, nothing I've seen in recent years evokes  such a sense of freedom. A bobby dazzler of a movie.",951609600,4,495,4.52808988764045

398773,4,630197204X,"I'm not a huge fan of westerns but I found this movie to be more realistic than a lot of John Wayne films I've watched with my dad.  I rate it up there with Silverado and Unforgiven to name some recent films.  Mainly saw  the movie because I'm a Dylan fan and his small role was interesting and  added a much needed side character.  The action is really good and so is  Coburn (Pat Garrett) and the acting of the man playing Billy The Kid.  Has  some slow parts but the music score was excellent.  It's a solid Western,  would probably do well nowadays in theaters.",916704000,5,565,4.245283018867925

love Kristoffen as an actor and his music but was not realistic to Billy the Kid, who was described as 5 foot 3 and 125pounds where Kristoffen is a big man, Billy the Kid by legend was killed at 21 and Kris is well older in the film..
