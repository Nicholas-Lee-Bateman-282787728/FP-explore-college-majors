6265664,2,B00IJB505M,"This is a mini series, but I thought it would be like the old VH1 Behind the Music series, but its not.  Depending on the kind of INXS fan you are, you may not find this as entertaining as this great band was in the 80's and 90's",1400889600,,229,3.7708333333333335
6265665,5,B00IJB505M,"""INXS: Never Tear Us Apart"" is an Australian television miniseries, which examines one of Australia's best rock bands. The narrative also explores lead singer Michael Hutchence as a key protagonist, with the rest of the band, and manager Chris Murphy as active participants. The story pieces together the band's progress complemented with occasional flashbacks, which gives substance to the deeper chemistry of the band, and the opportunity for the viewer to appreciate some of the complexities of Michael Hutchence's early life. The miniseries offers a wonderful dramatization of a world conquering Aussie band, and the great people who contributed to it.

6265670,5,B00IJB505M,"I will admit, I was a little hesitant to purchase this title as so many reviews had said it would not play on Region A/1......I was pleasantly surprised last night when I stuck it in the machine and in played flawlessly!  The performance given by Luke Arnold (John Silver Black Sails) as Michael Hutchence is one of the most incredibly accurate I've ever seen in a docu-drama. I particularly enjoyed the live performance footage cut into the film. I highly recommend this film to any INXS or Luke Arnold fan, it is well worth the money spent and will be watched a number of times.",1458172800,4,580,4.523809523809524

Regarding the region problems - I am in the US and bought the blu-ray here on Amazon and it works in my Samsung ""smart"" DVD player, but not in an older Panasonic blu-ray player.  So, I think it depends on your player.",1444953600,,447,4.223529411764706

6265684,4,B00IJB505M,"Captivating story of the rise of INXS.  The portrayal of Michael Hutchence had more depth in Part 2 but could have been developed more.  Overall, though, I enjoyed watching the mini-series, especially since I knew little about INXS before.  The music is of course fantastic..",1403049600,5,275,5.066666666666666
