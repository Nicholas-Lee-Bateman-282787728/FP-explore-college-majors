1804225,5,B00007AJFV,I bought this movie for my son and he LOVED it! I was very pleased with the speed at which we got it and the service Amaazon provided. I look forward to more purchases from Amazon!,1299715200,,180,4.027777777777778
1804226,4,B00007AJFV,"In this movie about a 16-year-old 'mail order bride,' probably the best aspect of it is that it gives some idea of what life was like in Manitoba in the middle of the 19th Century.  I would submit that the situation of Anne in this movie would certainly have been more the exception than the rule, however.  [More common would be the situation found in the 'Love Comes Softly' series of six movies, most directed by Michael Landon.]  What isn't explained is, when her husband is killed in a hunting accident (at least that is what the dead man's brother claimed), why they would try to cover up the death.  Even more mysterious is why, later in the winter, would Anne trudge through the 40-below snow to 'confess' to his death at the fort?  It makes for a mystifying story worth watching, however.  But, I would still say that the main value of the film is the glimpse it gives of life at the edge of the frontier.",1225152000,,914,4.410714285714286
1804227,4,B00007AJFV,"Like other reviewers, I looked into this film because of the lovely and very promising young actress who starred in the short-lived sitcom ""Wonderfalls"". After having let the DVD lay around my room for the past week or so, I thought i'd pop it in my DVD player and watch it finally. I can't say I fell in love with it, but for the performances, setting, story goes.. it all kept me very engaged and involved as the story unfolded. and - Although it wasn't a perfect movie, I'd say I enjoyed my experiance and will surely keep an eye out for the woman at the helm of this project. I have a feeling she's got a ton and half of talent and I'll be the first one in line when her next movie arrives in theaters (or videostores. either way). Overall Diagnosis: 7 out of 10.",1157587200,2,767,4.224489795918367
1804228,4,B00007AJFV,"I had never heard of this film before in the US. Like another reviewer I only came upon this film after looking into the work of Caroline Dhavernas, a tremendously beautiful and talented actress largely (and sadly) unknown to US audiences. The cinematography of the Canadian wilderness and gritty realism of the settlements bring to life the hostility of the Canadian frontier. The violence is disturbing, but in context, and excellently portrayed. Brendan Frehr is both believable and despicable as the tormentor of Dhavernas' character, and Anne Wheeler did an outstanding job directing the talented young cast in such a challenging environment.

Having become familiar with Dhavernas through Wonderfalls, this film brought to light the breadth of her acting range and I hope to see her in more projects in the US.",1111708800,14,816,5.181818181818182
1804229,4,B00007AJFV,"I just watched this film and was amazed by the acting as well as the directing.  Anne Wheeler does a wonderful job in capturing the beauty of the Canadian Wilderness in the 1800's.  The acting in this movie is superb.  Caroline Dhavernas, who plays Annie Herron, is an amazing talent and her performance in this film was wonderful.  The violence in this film was tastefully done, if that is even possible.  Brendan Fehr, who plays Annie's angry and abusive husband, did an excellent job.  You really dislike this guy and want him to suffer the way he makes those around him suffer.  I am from the U.S. and knew nothing about this film or the short story it was adapted from until I started researching the work of Caroline Dhavernas.  I recommend this film, it's beautifully put together.",1108425600,26,788,4.659420289855072
1804230,4,B00007AJFV,"What must it have been like in the mid-1800's homesteading the Canadian plains for a young woman in a marriage of convenience to a brutish husband, when the accents mingled curiously? I think I have acquired a sense of that because of the authentic texture the film-makers gave to this frontier setting.

The story is presented in the form of a mystery, altho the resolution is pretty easy to anticipate. It's the characters and situations we meet along the way, their interaction, their sensibilities, that move the story. But at a languid pace, like the times--when commuting was measured in hours and days.

The resilient young woman is at the center of two plots and her determination is made plausible by the immensely talented Caroline Dhavernas, and palatable with her offbeat beauty and lovely French-Canadian accent. The other actors acquit themselves well, even the normally amateurish Brendan Fehr. But only the direction (by Anne Wheeler) and photography contribute as much as Dhavernas does.

Not a great film, but fascinating if you want atmosphere, and a glimpse of a different era, and plenty of glimpses of a nude Dhavernas.",1084752000,15,1141,5.058510638297872
1804231,3,B00007AJFV,"Does the acting world not realize what a gem they have in this man?  If you do not remember him, his most famous role was the character Methos in Highlander: the Series in the mid-90's.

Anyway, I am extremely curious to know what capacity he played in this particular film?  Thank you to anyone who could respond.",1059609600,3,314,4.473684210526316
1804232,4,B00007AJFV,"Brendan Fehr shows his versatilty as an actor in this movie. He made his character so believable that even I, a huge fan, felt an enormous dislike for the character Simon. And his accent was right on. The movie itself was extremely well done and my heart ached for Annie. It makes you wonder how many women and young girls went through this kind of situation back then.",1046044800,15,369,4.4411764705882355
1804233,4,B00007AJFV,"This movie is not your typical light hearted Hollywood fare but a grim realistic portrayal of a young woman's struggle to survive in the harsh frontier world of western Canada in the 1850s.
  I found the scenery brooding yet impressive, perfect for setting the dark moods of this movie. The costuming too looked very authentic for the period, nothing fancy but what served them well for survival.
  The cast impressed me too. Newcomer Caroline Dhaveras is the main character and puts on a fine performance in both a difficult and sympathetic part. Brendan Fehr is suitably brutal in the part of the vicious husband, Corey Sevier as the decent brother has the complex role of being a character with both strengths and weaknesses and pulls it off very well. Paul Johannsen is the kindhearted authority who has to investigate a puzzling mystery. All the acting is top notch.
  While not for everyone due to its gloomy subject matter and quite graphic use of violence and sex, I found this movie, directed by Anne Wheeler, to be a fascinating glimpse of what it might have been like for young people trapped out in a forbidding world they couldn't ever have prepared themselves for.
  I would definitely rate this movie at least 4 of out 5 stars.",1045440000,12,1242,4.744186046511628
1804234,4,B00007AJFV,"Having recently seen the highly impressive Brendan Fehr (TVs 'Roswell') take on the acting roles of a Vampire-hunter (`The Forsaken'), a man with no future ('Final Destination') and, just this week actually interviewing him for his role as a biker ('Biker Boyz'), to see him stretch his acting talents into something as period-based, and as ruggedly-biting as <I>'Edge of Madness'</I> was a pleasure beyond all emotions. His permanently-angered portrayal of an unloving, uncaring, yet extremely hard-working husband out in the wilderness of yore is an acting talent at its most recent finest. Anne Wheeler as the unlucky youthful new bride is quite brilliant also and as the film gently slides back and forth through a series of flashbacks, you slowly get to realize that she too has undertaken a sizeable role here and come up trumps also. Slow in places, yet scenic at all times, the acting is outstanding and the resulting conclusion - although hardly disguised - is at least one that leaves you without regret.

The kid brother is painted in a good light, but is worse than Simon. Kid brother is like a romantic drama queen type guy who flips for Simon's wife.  The story is setup to basically explode with clashes.  The main weakness of the story is that it is told leaning on the good kid brother and the abused girl vs. the evil Simon.

1804483,5,B00007AJFV,"An unusual story of hardship in a different time and place. Annie is a young woman who, like many young women of today, believes that marriage will be wonderful and found too late that marriage can be otherwise. Her husband, like most men of that time period, sees her as no better than an animal, treats her abusively, and punishes her by brutally raping her. Her fault, in the eyes of men, was being educated and having achieved the ability to read and write in a time when the education of women was thought not to be needed and certainly not wanted. Annie was chattel property, just like all wives and daughters of the time. The message of the movie is about how women were discounted, their thoughts and feelings unimportant, and how they were despised by those who resented it when they resisted being raped. Rape was a man's right because a woman had no rights. I have read the top critical review and see it as blindness to the story because it is the story that is important.",1458000000,5,984,4.472222222222222

1804511,5,B00007AJFV,"This movie sparred us from the formula delivery of sexual abusiveness and violence, and its cinematography and acting are so skillful. Actually, it sparred us from a lot of film formulas. It was adapted from a story by Alice Munro, who is so fine a writer that you feel like you are breathing new air when you read her and that freshness came through in this film. Also, we get to enjoy Tantoo Cardinal's acting and that's a treat. I wanted to see what Caroline Dhavernas would do in this film, but being forewarned by other reviews, I was bracing myself for the worst and was ready to turn it off if the violence was plunked in for its own sake. However, I found that the duration, frequency and level of explicitness of the sex abuse and violence gave the idea of how bad it was without being gratuitous. The extreme hardship, isolation and urgency of homesteading in that climate and era seemed real. All the time they are trying to get this house built using only hand tools, I'm thinking they had better hurry and doubted it be warm enough anyway. Would it flood in the spring being built so close to the river? There was a lot of tension in just the logistics, never mind the hideous, fearful and unloving dynamic among the three. The non linear aspects of the story line was bothersome to some, but I enjoyed this. It helped describe how emotional and physical hardship can result in confusion. Horrifying events can consume ones thoughts unbidden so that the past is very much part of the present, like it or not. Also, this traveling from past to present made the unraveling of the mystery suspenseful. Events were being reconstructed so the flash back is a good tool for rebuilding a sequence in a mystery. Well, yeah, maybe more bucks could have been spent on the dialect coach, but this only puts a little chink in the 5th star. This was a great movie.",1431561600,3,1864,4.517751479289941

Enjoyable, if somewhat slight, and most of the relationships never quite rang true for me (the exception is that between the alleged murderess and the lead investigator); how much you can overlook that likely determines how much you'll end up liking it.

1804545,3,B00007AJFV,I bought this DVD on Amazon. Gloomy and dark even outdoors. Lights shut off when beautiful Cory Sevier takes a bath. No Hollywood flash; it's Canadian! Flash of light would have helped greatly. I had to turn up the brightness on my TV to see anything. Love Sevier and Fehr. Plot drags especially with constant flashbacks. I didn't notice any violence to speak of. I did not get the impression that Annie went mad; she certainly did not act as such. She had a right to be upset about being abandoned in the wilderness by her brother-in-law/lover. Everything is implausibly resolved in a big rush in the last four minutes; it's too much of a contrast with the preceding plodding slow motion. It's as though they were running out of film or steam or maybe money. They ran out of light a long time prior. Unanswered questions: Whom did George marry and why? Why did  he abandon Annie? How was she supposed to survive alone in the wilderness? How did she know that the baby was George's? Who was Sadie? Her pregnancy was just thrown in for sympathy.
