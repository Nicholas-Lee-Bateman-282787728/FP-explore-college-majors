8404392,5,B003SKWR78,We really enjoy Rick Sebaks fun little documentaries. They are such fun to watch and never fail to make us smile. We've started looking for our own out of the way places thanks to Mr. Sebak. It makes you want to find an adventure of your own. I'd recommend any of Rick Sebak's films. Very entertaining.,1523577600,,302,4.410714285714286

8404399,4,B003SKWR78,"This PBS show is similar to others that Pittsburgh native Rick Sebak has produced for WQED and PBS. (Hot Dogs and Sandwiches were two others.). In those he visited places that are local traditions. This time most of the places - not all - were started in the last 10 years. And, except for Portland Oregon, San Francisco and Columbus OH most are in small out of the way places that you probably won't get to in your life.

But the food looks greats and the customers who are interviewed are true fans. Many eat at this places five times a week. Of course many of them look like they do too. Nearly all are places serving high fat, high carb items and HUGE portions. So this is not a ""healthy"" show. But the art of ""plate""-ing is definitely shown.

The DVD version has two bonus features. First there is a short series of ""promos"" that were aired to advertise the show.

Next is a 13 minute ""Making of"" featurette in which Sebak tells how they set up the itinerary and shows clips of places which they visited that couldn't fit in the 56-minute PBS time frame. (They are planning to edit into Part 2. Among those places, they visit Philadelphia, Raleigh, NC and two restaurants in HAWAII.

My frustration in watching this DVD was in not being able to get to any of these places and many are one of a kind.  Luckily I watched the show after dinner so I didn't need to rush out after watching it to get a five egg omelet (with gravy), bacon, sausage buckwheat pancakes and real maple syrup. (Hungry yet?). Fans of Sebak's shows will enjoy this but don't look for places that have been doing this for years (except for the Maple Inn pancake place in upstate New York (which is only open 9 weeks a year but has been doing it for over 30 years and STILL has long lines).

8404400,5,B003SKWR78,"I've seen this about six times and look forward to another replay or two during the membership drive running in my area.

The businesses featured in this program show different versions of the American dream being played out, and serving a tasty breakfast of comfort food, too. Several of the owner-operators of these unique places are refugees from Corporate America. Others are keeping long-established family traditions alive.

I want to eat at all these places, especially the buckwheat pancakes (New York maple syrup farm) and the spinach and egg dish (Tybee Island).

The newest restaurants in this special (and there were hints of a possible second part) were in the Columbus, Ohio area. The twists and creative versions of traditional foods didn't bother me. Every established dish was once a cook's innovation.

IMO, this program is Americana all the way, well told and inspiring.",1280880000,,889,5.152777777777778
8404401,3,B003SKWR78,"Saw broadcast on PBS last night.  They traveled to new breakfast restaurants.  Last 2 were in Portland -- brand new restaurants, trendy, ""hip"" serving veggie sausage and rosemary gravy, and a very strange clientele...... not that there's anything wrong with that.

I'm not saying the show is bad... it's just not the nostalgic, Americana feel of Diners, Hot Dogs, Ice Cream, etc.....  I hope this is not Mr. Sebak's new direction, I feel I've lost an old friend.",1279152000,8,462,4.884615384615385
