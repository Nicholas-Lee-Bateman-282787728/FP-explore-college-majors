2825321,5,B000PMFRTW,"I remember seeing this when it first came out and have waited years to see it again. I have been a diver for 20 years. This is one of those movies that started it all. The stars of the movie, Stan Waterman, Peter Gimbel, and the Taylor's are icons in the diving and underwater film making business. This is the first movie of Great White sharks and the lengths to which these people went to film them are astounding. These adventurers went out in the middle of the Indian Ocean, parked themselves next to a sperm whale carcass, and got up close and personal with large oceanic sharks at feeding time. They also went to the Hermes wreck at 180 feet and off the coast of Dangerous Reef in the Sourthern Ocean.

- no dive computers, no DAN to evac you out, and never quite knowing what to expect. This is a true life adventure caught on tape when diving really was by the seat of your pants. If you are a diver or adventurer you must see this film. If you like the film buy the book that documents the adventure - Blue Meridian - The Search for the Great White Shark by Peter Matthiessen",1189123200,8,1084,4.262135922330097
2825322,5,B000PMFRTW,"I just watched this movie for the first time and I must say i was amazed! This documentary by Peter Gimbel follows his crew to exotic locations including South Africa, Madagascar, Ceylon and Australia looking to be the first to film the Great White shark in its own world. The footage is fantastic with some of the most harrowing moments ever shot on film. Truly the moment where one by one the divers exit the safety of their cages to film dozens of feeding oceanic whitetips is unprecedented and unlikely to be repeated again. I couldn't believe my eyes as the Taylors(Ron & Valerie) and Peter Gimbel continuously prodded away the inquisitive sharks while Stan Waterman filmed the breathless action. When the crew travels to Dangerous Reef,Australia and meets the Great White, the results are spectacular. Never before had a Great White been filmed in its own environment and the pulse-pounding work of these underwater pioneers is priceless. A great purchase for all shark enthusiasts or action fans this DVD comes with several extra features including a reunion of the crew members who reminisce fondly of their great adventures beneath the waves. A MUST HAVE!",1187049600,6,1164,4.9743589743589745
2825323,5,B000PMFRTW,"I'd been waiting to see BWWD since 1971. Tried to get a VHS copy but failed. Now the DVD is out and a copy appeared in my mailbox, having pre-ordered several months ago. The movie itself is every bit as exciting as I remembered it. My wife, who is a also a diehard scuba diver and hadn't seen it before, agreed it's top notch. The real bonus is the high quality of the digital transfer. Every bit as clear as the original, with stunning colors and lighting to match. What a pleasure to watch. There is also a bonus feature on a get-together with some of the divers, including the Taylors and Stan Waterman.",1186358400,7,606,4.324561403508772

2825326,5,B000PMFRTW,"In 1969 Peter Gimbel set off on the First ever Expedition to Film The Great White Shark. His Team included other World famous underwater Photographers: Stan Waterman, Ron & Valerie Taylor, and also Shark Attack Survivor Rodney Fox.

Their search for the Great White lasted for 9 months and it took them from South Africa to South Australia. The tension, the drama, the setbacks... of a long journey, plus the first ever awesome underwater photography make this documentary an all time classic and a living tribute both to the team and the sharks.

A lot of the footage that was Filmed had never been seen before. Some highlights like the dives with the feeding Oceanic Whitetips, and the final encounter with the Great White Shark are simply awesome.

Peter Gimbel and his team were the first to introduce me to SHARKS with this Documentary when I first saw it in 1971 and Since then, my life has never been the same again.

Valerie and Ron Taylor, well-known skin-divers who brought the great white shark to public prominence in this documentary, along with diver Peter Dilbert, were the stars. Tom Chapin came along as an assistant cameraman on deck and just happened to bring his guitar with him, providing some folk music for the soundtrack.

2825344,5,B000PMFRTW,"For the time this documentary was made, the filming is unbelievable.  The fact that these people put themselves in such danger without the safety measures that Shark Week has today is so impressive.  I know that some people find it ""slow"", but it is a documentary and one that was well before its time.  Simply fantastic!!!",1410480000,,323,4.732142857142857
2825345,1,B000PMFRTW,"Ordered this movie because I thought it might bring back a little nostalgia. My Dad took me to this movie when I was about 8 years old. I remember it scared me way back when. What I DIDN'T remember, was the sickening whale hunting mentality off the coast of Durban, South Africa. And these so-called scientists trying to photograph great white sharks are happily cheering on the whaling boats. ""Hopefully they'll get a nice shot at that one!"" and so forth. Having just returned from Southeastern Alaska on a small boat cruise where we saw many magnificent, beautiful, harmless whales, I was particularly nauseated by these scenes. I know very well that that was then and this is now, but I happily threw this garbage into the trash can with no regrets.",1409788800,,752,4.704545454545454

2825347,5,B000PMFRTW,Peter Gimbel created one of the best documentaries in the hunt for a Great White shark. The footage of Rodney Fox's attack by a Great White was incredible as well as his help in finding one of the greatest sea creatures that is so mis-understood. It's  an excellent film.,1395964800,,271,4.530612244897959
2825348,2,B000PMFRTW,"A Classic. But we have learned SO much about sharks in the past 40 years - referring white sharks as ""White Death"" shows its age. Now we protect the species, we no longer fear them.",1390348800,,181,4.2
2825349,4,B000PMFRTW,"Having grown up in the 60's and 70's I can certainly speak to the intensity in which this film was received. Back in those days so little was known about the Great White and no documentary illustrates that better. Here we have arguably the top researchers and explorers in the hunt, aimlessly searching without the slightest notion what to do to attract this creature. Science has certainly come a long way since those days and the viewer should certainly take that into account when watching this. But what the makers of this film (and Valerie Harper in particular) don't want you to see was the hype THEY MANUFACTURED while making and showing this documentary. Before setting sail in South Africa, a public announcement is made stating they are in search of the ""most dangerous predator still alive in the world today"". Describes them as ""attacking"" the remains of whales afloat off the coast and basically paints the picture (mainly born from ignorance) that these creatures are to be feared. And then of course you have all of these classic posters and even now the DVD cover that invoke their own sensationalism.

But today we have a very coy Valerie Harper playing dumb to this message they themselves concocted and plays the innocent lamb that can't 'understand' why Jaws carried the impact it did. So if you ever wonder what started this sensationalism over the Great White, well... your watching it right here. And a great deal of it specifically came from Ron and Valerie Taylor. And while they have spent the remainder of their lives trying to perform revisionist history for themselves, the truth is these two people were traveling America in the early 70's, going from town to town, scaring people with this film. Jaws was simply the cherry placed on top. All of these statements about protecting the Great White in the past 30 years have been said strictly to pacify their liberal, scientific peers who essentially are cleaning up the mess they made. So watch this film with that thought well in place. The documentary itself is fascinating to watch because of the collection of iconic faces from the scientific world. A real gem for most of the right reasons, but also a product that carries the dark legacy of starting the sensationalism that has lasted more than 40 years about this creature.",1389398400,,2309,4.83080808080808
2825350,2,B000PMFRTW,The movie was a gift and the quality of the movie itself was great but it arrived in some kind of rapper CD case where the songs were n word this and that.

2825353,5,B000PMFRTW,"I had read a book recently about sharks around the Farallon Islands, so this DVD was a natural progression. A wonderful movie showing what tagging sharks involves and what big sharks are like up close.

2825354,2,B000PMFRTW,"Blue Water White Death: Set in the early 70's, this documentary is from a time when the Great White was considered a mindless killing machine. In fact those attributes were applied to many sharks. Gimbel and company set out in an old ship to track down the ""White Death"" with camera divers such as Ron and Valerie Taylor who would become known for their Great White footage in movies such as ""Jaws"".

It's slow going. While there is some gorgeous footage, we don't encounter the subject of the movie for almost the entire first hour. It's about the search and things they see along the way. When the Great White finally does appear, it's magnificent and, at least for time, somewhat scary. Nowadays with evens such as ""Shark Week"", we're quite familiar with the animal, but at the time, this was heady stuff.

Be prepared to wait for you reward...and a brief one at that.",1330732800,2,871,4.612903225806452
2825355,5,B000PMFRTW,"Its easy to watch this and see the dated clothing, the bewildering lack of knowledge about Great Whites (compared with today) and think less of it as a result. Instead, focus on the superb underwater footage and the genuine sense of exploration that this film shares with the viewers. It is an absolute classic, long before Jaws, long before ""shark week"" or anything similar, these guys were out there looking for sharks. The whale hunting scenes are heart breaking, but should be seen for what they are - history. An excellent documentary, if you have even the slightest interest in sharks, diving or ocean-based adventure I would watch this.",1321833600,,643,4.908256880733945
2825356,5,B000PMFRTW,"I saw ""Blue Water, White Death"" when I was a boy, and it had a tremendous impact on me.  After ""Jaws"" scared us out of the ocean, ""BWWD"" encouraged me to get back in and marvel at the wondrous creatures who live there.  Especially the sharks!

Moreso than Cousteau, this movie inspired my lifelong love of the ocean.  I wish Peter Gimbel were still with us, so he could see the wonderful films that he inspired (""Air Jaws"", etc.).  This was the first modern shark documentary, and in many ways it is still the best.  It hasn't dated in the least, or lost any of its impact.",1308182400,,573,4.308411214953271
2825357,5,B000PMFRTW,"Remember seeing this movie back in '72 at the 183 Drive-in in Irving, Texas when I was a child. I remembered this movie for many years (until JAWS came along and took 'the bite' out of it). Never thought I as a child would be so facinated with a documentary. After viewing this DVD, it brings a smile to my face. I don't remember the widescreen framing like the DVD, but it really uses the frame from far left to far right in the 2.35 frame. Makes me go back to yesteryear like never before! This is an awesome documentary film. The video image is nice and clean (for a doc) and the mono sound does its job. A few special features are included (a really good making of).
This movie (with its widescreen) puts Shark Week on Discovery Channel to shame! They just don't make movies like they used to. And by the way, it's G-rated. That's the cherry on top!
Enjoy this classic, before it becomes out of print. It seems it took forever to come out on DVD. And love that cover!!",1297987200,3,972,4.2594594594594595
2825358,3,B000PMFRTW,"This ""movie"" (more like a documentary) was made before ""Jaws"" (early 1970's) and is VERY disappointing.  It's more like seeing the preparation and the search for sharks and you don't see the shark until almost the end.  I do not recommend this at all, and there are many other shark DVD's that are so much better.  Don't waste your money.",1275868800,4,338,4.6
2825359,5,B000PMFRTW,"Groundbreaking in every sense of the word!! Before shark week, before Jaws and before we knew much of anything about sharks this crew took to the sea in search of the notorious Great White shark!! Superb entertainment for all ages!!",1254182400,,232,4.825
2825380,5,B000PMFRTW,"I am fascinated by sharks and have watched a lot of nature shows on them. Long before Shark Week and not too much before Jaws came Blue Water, White Death, which I was lucky to have taped off a TV channel so I could watch it over and over. From the start of the expedition and the launching of the Terrier to the moment all viewers waited for off Dangerous Reef was non-stop excitement, letdowns, concerns for Peter Gimbel when he got the bends, and finally success in Australia on the suggeston of Rodney Fox to head there if they wanted to find  and film great whites. There was such camaraderie (I checked for the spelling in my dictionary but it isn't there) among the crew members. On board was brother to late Harry Chapin, Tom Chapin, who began the movie with the wonderful South Winds song, as well as the funny if inaccurate The Most Chivalrous Shark of the Ocean (who really does not eat just men). From one place to another the scientists and photographers hunted for the great white, but the viewers were not disappointed when they failed because there were plenty of other sharks to keep them satisfied. The action they found when they succeeded more than made up for their earlier failures. I am so pleased this movie was released on a DVD and hope some who haven't seen it will buy it for the unmatched excellence of this expedition knowing everything they see is real. No computer graphics back in those days, anyway. I have read Blue Meridian so many years ago I had forgotten about it until one of these reviewers mentioned it and would be worth purchasing along with the movie to get a more in-depth accounting of all that took place. Five stars is the top rating, and this movie deserves that, and more.",1238284800,,1723,4.50479233226837

2825385,5,B000PMFRTW,"Blue Water, White Death is a wonderful blend of action, suspense and historical underwater cinematography.
The shark encounters might seem a bit tame by today's standards, especially if you are used to watching leaping Great Whites on NG's Shark Week and other wild-life shows. But the movie was shot in the innocent pre-Jaws early 70's, when few people knew much about sharks or shark behavior.
Watching the divers fend off schools of circling Oceanic White-tip sharks off South Africa is intense as it gets. Later, in Australian waters, you feel the adrenelin pumping as the divers film from inside cages while Great Whites rake their razor-sharp, serrated incisors along the bars.
A special treat is watching legends Stan Waterman, Valerie and Ron Taylor, Rodney Fox, and the late Peter Gimbel, diving in their prime, and then seeing them today and listening to them reprise their exciting experience.
