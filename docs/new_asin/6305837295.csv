However, the quality of the video transfer to the DVD is not very well done in quite a few of the scenes. Quality looks no better than a low grade VHS tape in the Grand canyon and some other segments, especially the White Sands segment. And there is abolutely no info whatsoever anywhere on the DVD. The only audio is new age music and maybe a little bit of noise from a waterfall. Absolutely no dialogue whatsoever. Not even any captions or titles to allow you to know what you're looking at. Decent DVD if all you want are relaxing videos and music, but avoid it if you want something informative.",1012089600,2,760,4.321678321678322
8461558,4,6305837295,"I'm glad I bought this DVD.  It was organized into eight National Parks and provided a variety of scenary set to quality New Age music.  I especially like remembering my visits to parks such as Olympic National  Park in ""Rain Forest"" and Rainer National Park in ""Behind  the Waterfall.""  The chapter on Bryce Canyon National Park called  ""Sculptures"" is a reminder that Nature is the best artist around.  The journey through the arches was mesmorizing!",962323200,9,452,4.946666666666666
