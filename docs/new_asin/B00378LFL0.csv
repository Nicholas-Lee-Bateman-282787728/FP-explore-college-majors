8415523,5,B00378LFL0,"I have actually purchased ALL 43 ""Crime Stories"" DVD's and found them to be excellent documentaries of real crime history.
The first DVD I purchased two years ago included the first six episodes, with the remaining 42 one hour programs on individual discs.
  The only down side is the cost of these programs but this Canadian production company's presentation is so professionally done it is well worth the bucks to have in my library here at home.
  Some of the most famous Serial Murderers from both the United States and Canada are featured here, including interviews with the actual Detectives, Forensic Scientists, Newspaper Journalists, and victim family members accompany the accurate and well acted dramatazations of these chilling and disturbing events in Criminal History.",1310774400,2,782,5.282258064516129
