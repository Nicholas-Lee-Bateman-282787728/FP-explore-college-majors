8290842,5,B001D0T4MG,"This is the classic Starlicks video from 1984.  Steve Lukather takes you through some of his best licks and solos and gives you a rundown on his gear back then.  I had a ton of these videos back in the day and I wish Hal Leonard would reprint all of them.  Obviously the video quality isn't Blu-Ray quality, but the video quality looks like a brand new VHS tape with no tracking issues and is perfectly acceptable to anyone who was around back in the time period as I was.

One reviewer wrote about the lack of tab, and for those worried about the tab booklet I can tell you that it is included but it is the tab style used back in the early 80's for many of the Starlicks videos.  It's very easy to read.  Underneath each of the notes of the standard notation there is a fraction symbol.  The top number is the string and the bottom number is the fret. If it says 1/12 then it means 12th fret on the high e string.  It takes a minute to get use to it but I can easily read it just as fast as tab once you've done it a few times.",1495670400,,1029,3.9853658536585366
8290843,1,B001D0T4MG,I have purchased many instructional DVDs and this is one of the worst...the content basically is a show of how well he plays bordering arogance...the video quality is poor..think vhs tape converted to dvd pre windows 95 pc home made. Save your money and look elsewhere.,1447632000,,269,4.869565217391305

8290845,4,B001D0T4MG,I would have given this 5 stars but the instruction manual is written in standard notation. That makes it difficult for me (and most).,1357689600,,134,4.625
