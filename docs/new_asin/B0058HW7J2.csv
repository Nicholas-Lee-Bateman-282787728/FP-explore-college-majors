8461560,4,B0058HW7J2,"This is a no nonsense get going and try hard yoga work out.  I am finding it very challenging and rewarding at the same time, but that is yoga for you I suppose.  I love that they are in small 12 - 20 minute practises so you can fit it into your day easier than the usual hour session.",1369872000,2,285,3.8135593220338984
8461561,2,B0058HW7J2,"While the actual yoga routine and voice over cues (of those I've managed to do so far) are good, I dislike that neither the cover nor either disc lists the titles of the different practices.  There is no description of what will be covered in each practice, nor how long they are.  Also, at least when I play it on my DVD player (and I've had no issues with any other DVDs), none of the titles highlight in the menu, so I can't even see what I'm selecting.  I move my arrows up and down, but nothing highlights, so when I ""select"" something, it's a crap shoot as far as which one starts.  If I go back to the menu and just hit the up or down menu to try to select the previous or next program instead, sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't.  On disc 2, I can't get to 2 of the 4 programs.",1364515200,12,790,4.038461538461538
8461562,5,B0058HW7J2,these DVDs have short practices that offer a lot of variety. the thing i liked most was that there is no music and no distractions. a voice over describes the moves while someone in a totally bare white room performs them. i enjoy the narrator's calm voice.,1341100800,3,257,4.48936170212766
8461563,4,B0058HW7J2,I am thrilled with the DVDs. I wanted video instruction to work with while out of town & away from my usual classes. These are excellent!  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the workouts are not listed on the DVD or packaging. Nor are the times of each routine listed. Other than that I'm happy!,1324512000,2,312,4.2
8461564,5,B0058HW7J2,"This DVD is exactly what I needed for my home practice! I love YJ's livemag practices on their website, but it's really annoying to have to find and load individual videos on your laptop whenever you want to watch them! (Plus, I never like doing yoga to my laptop screen....it kind of ruins it for me). These sequences are some of the best I've used, mostly because the DVD gives you so many options depending on your goals.

FYI, even though the cover says there are 9 practices, it's because one of the sequences (Heart Wide Open) has 2 different parts. I love this option because the two parts really build on one another, but I can do them individually if I don't have the extra time!

I highly recommend this DVD for anyone in need of a good guide for their individual practice.",1314576000,12,783,4.430555555555555
8461565,2,B0058HW7J2,"I was excited to get these new YJ DVD's assuming they were new material. I suspected why there wasn't more info about the products but the covers and the little description made it look very appealing so I ordered the DVD's (they are already available on other websites). When I previewed them it finally striked me that those are the same practices from their website (livemag section), now I know why they were so vague about the description but I should have known better. I also noticed that there are 8 practices and not 9 ! 4 on each DVD and the total runtime is about 145 min. and not 180 min. it could have fit one DVD perfectly but of course they had to make it a 2 DVD set that costs almost 30 $ so you would think you'll get a 9 practices of 20 min. but most of them are 11-18 min.  I'm sure the practices themselves are good (you could watch most of them on their website!) and for some people the DVD format is more convenient but they could still advertise these DVD's as what they really are instead of giving vague and wrong  description to make more people buy them. Some of the practices were designed by known instructors such as Kathryn Budig, Lilias Follan & Stephanie Snyder but the voiceover and demonstration is not by them.",1311638400,56,1248,4.351931330472103
