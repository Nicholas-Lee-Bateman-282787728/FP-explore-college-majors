8117122,1,B000F48DDM,"Majdanek is quite an embarrassment to holocaust propagandists.  At first, it was the second Auschwitz, camp number two in the Nazi extermination network.  The Soviets spoke first of 1.7 million and then of 1.5 million people being exterminated there, and in her 1975 book ""The War Against the Jews"" Lucy Dawidowicz ""calculated"" that Majdanek ""annihilation camp"" claimed the lives of 1.38 million Jews.  The Amazon editorial review speaks confidently of ""the TWO MILLION innocent victims exterminated and the frightful efficiency of the NAZI DEATH FACTORY.""  To the chagrin of holocaust storytellers, it quickly became apparent that these numbers were ridiculous, for the simple reason that they far exceeded the number of people ever sent to Majdanek.  As a result, western historians diligently ignored Majdanek, since examining it would raise fundamental questions concerning the reliability of holocaust claims.  Meanwhile, in Polish historiography the number who died at Majdanek has been revised first to 360,000 (Zdzisaw ukaszkiewicz, 1948; Jzef Marszaek, 1981), then to 235,000 (Czesaw Rajca, 1992), and now to 78,000 (Thomasz Kranz, 2005).  The actual figure is lower still, as shown in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Concentration-Camp-Majdanek-A-Historical-and-Technical-Study/dp/159148006X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Concentration Camp Majdanek: A Historical and Technical Study</a>.

In the face of this steady scholarly retreat, one might expect holocaust propagandists to keep quiet about Majdanek.  That would be an error.  Faced with the factual frailty of the case for the holocaust, they have merely intensified their propaganda, making a kind of fundamentalist defence of the traditional dogmas of the holocaust religion.  This film shows this unregenerate devotion to the original holocaust creed at its most absurd.  It goes beyond even the Soviets and claims that two million were killed at Majdanek. The usual baby atrocity stories make their appearance, as do quite a creative list of extermination methods, including drowning!

Two other forms of evidence for extermination are given.  First, piles of shoes and clothing alleged to belong to murdered victims.  On the basis of German wartime documents, we now know that Majdanek housed a clothing manufacturing plant and was involved in supplying troops on the eastern front with shoes and clothing, as well as repairing damaged shoes sent back from the front.  Second, cans of zyklon-B, which was supposedly used for gassing prisoners.  Zyklon-B was a pesticide, and was supplied even to the camps at which no-one has ever claimed people were killed with gas.  It was used for fumigating clothing in order to prevent the spread of disease.

At times the film's anti-German propaganda is unintentionally funny.  For example, a bathroom is alleged to have been for SS men only.  Those evil Germans!  But wait - do guards and inmates use the same bathrooms in American prisons?  Do teachers and students use the same bathrooms in American schools?

Some footage of the Soviet Lublin (a.k.a. Majdanek) show trial is shown, and forms the most interesting portion of the film.  One readily sympathizes with the German soldiers caught up in this myth in the making.  Like so many people caught in such a situation, some of them tried to defend themselves on narrow grounds, avoiding offending the court by confining themselves to claiming that whatever happened was the result of superior orders, and that they weren't personally involved in it.  Unsurprisingly for a Soviet show trial, all were sentenced to death.

The readiest proof that the tale of Majdanek ""annihilation camp"" is false is the fact that 20,000 of its prisoners were released.  After the Germans went to all the trouble of designing a top secret extermination program (according to the holocaust story), a program so secret there was no written order, no written plan, no organization in charge, no budget; so secret that Hitler never talked about it in his private conversations, that Goebbels falsified his private diary for years to deceive future historians - after going to all that trouble, the Germans willingly released 20,000 witnesses to extermination?!  In the words of Horace: ""Credat Judaeus Apella, non ego.""",1359763200,2,4305,5.52824427480916
8117123,2,B000F48DDM,"Part of a series focusing on the camps run by the Nazis during WW II, ""The Liberation of Majdanek"" recounts the atrocities committed by the Nazis at Majdanek, the only operational concentration camp at the time of its liberation. Located near Lublin, Poland, 2 million people were murdered at this Nazi extermination camp. Though the subject is compelling, the production quality leaves much to be desired. Firstly, the narrator uses a dull, monotonous voice without much emotion at all. A lot of the archival footage (I believe this was shot by the liberating Red Army forces) is dark and shaky. This production could have used better restoration.

There is some compelling footage here, including one of survivors facing the Nazis at a Russian tribunal. I wish there had been contemporary interviews with survivors, and historians' perspectives of the camp, especially since Majdanek is not covered as widely as other extermination camps like Auschwitz and Dachau.",1267920000,10,966,5.232258064516129

True nobody forced me to buy it but i have many films about the Holocaust that have been restored to good quality. This is not one of them.",1260662400,5,287,3.8813559322033897
