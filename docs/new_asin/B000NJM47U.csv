8178418,4,B000NJM47U,"First and foremost to avoid any confusion- this is in FRENCH! Just as the title and product discriptions says. Not English or Spanish or Japanese.. just French.

Ok now that that is out of the way on to an actual review of the set itself.

PROS-

The playback is smooth with good colouring (Considering the show's age) and the sound is clear and crisp with, as far as I have seen so far no skipping or catching or volume fluctuations. The menus are easy to navigate with not too many (non actually) extras to confuse or clutter up.

Decent dubbing

The boxes themselves are beautifully done (if a bit bulky)

Lots of episodes per disks. (between 6 and 7- unheard of on kids DVD's)

CONS

Lack of subtitling/ closed captioning. Even though it is a French release it would have been really nice to have some English Subtitling  (like many other 'foreign' language DVD's have even when they're not being sold out of their native country). Closed Captioning for those with hearing issues would have been nice as well. Not an issue for me but it might be for someone else.

The boxes are rather large and bulky with each disc having an individual holder. Sucks when you have limited space to deal with.

Only plays on region 2 compatible players. Really sucks when you don't have a compatible player.

Conclusion-

From what I have seen of the series so far. Overall is a very nicely put together set, obviously a lot of thought was put into the design and play of the disks. And since this is the only way to get the series 100% complete (all episodes and as far as I can tell no episode cuts) it's a must have for a die hard like me. And I found that even though my French is passable at best and non-existent at worst the series is still very easy to follow, even though I haven't seen most of it in 20 years so didn't remember a whole lot. The worst part is missing the jokes but hey... one can fill in the blanks with a bit of imagination :) Getting used to the voices takes ALOT of time.... but as far as dubs go it's not a bad one. (I have heard much worse for this series in other languages)

However if you are looking for an English soundtrack or subtitles as your must have... look elsewhere. And good luck finding it... Season 1 is floating around out there but that's it. We can only hope that in the future an English, uncut, release will come around. For now though you want the series complete, uncut and decently enough done- this is it kiddies.

And for heavens sake make sure you have access to a Region 2 compatible player before you buy it! I have a lot of foreign DVD's so for me it was not an issue, but if you don't have one or access to one... don't buy the set. It flat out will NOT play in anything but a compatible Region 2 player. I say Compatible because it will play in Region-0 or Region Free players (Though the disks themselves aren't Region Free)",1415577600,4,2876,4.319702602230484
