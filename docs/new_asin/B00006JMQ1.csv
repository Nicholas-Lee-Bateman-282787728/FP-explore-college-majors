7970329,2,B00006JMQ1,"My middling rating does not reflect on The Three Stooges, who are, of course fantastic, but as a criticism of Sony/Columbia, which by releasing the Stooges on DVD in the manner it does, shows a tremendous lack of respect for their brilliance, as well as for their commercial success.  We all know about how Columbia treated the Stooges so shoddily while they worked for the studio, underpaying them despite the fact that they were one of the studio's most valuable properties; sadly, this disrespect even continues on.

Columbia should be releasing DVD's that honor the Stooges work, not just exploit it.  They could easily have made these DVD's into tributes to the Stooge's work at the studio, as historical records of their years of great work.  They should have arranged the shorts chronologically, instead of by these bizarre 'themes', often based more upon the titles than the actual content of the shorts.  As an example, the 'Three Smart Saps' disc contains five shorts that have the word 'three' in their titles, while 'G.I. Stooges' contains episodes where the Stooges serve in the military (not necessarily the US military, I might add!, OR the merchant marine(BACK FROM THE FRONT), OR just wear enemy uniforms (NO DOUGH BOYS).

This approach makes little sense, and it really breaks down on the 'Cops and Robbers' disc, which includes shorts where the Stooges are private detectives, reporters, firemen AND veterinarians!

Others have pointed out better than I can the other shortcomings of these discs (no special features, only five shorts per disc, etc...).

I would add another complaint that on several of the shorts, there are small snippets of scenes missing, which tells me that Columbia did VERY little work in compiling these discs.  The prints ARE excellent, and the sound is good, but it seems that the studio just used the prints they had available, and made no effort to seek out others that were more complete.  I KNOW that more complete prints exist, because like all of you, I have seen them for years shown on TV.  How miserly and uncaring of Columbia to not put some effort into fully restoring these shorts.  It could have been done, but apparently they did not think it worth bothering.

Columbia, SHAME ON YOU!

Despite this, a Stooges fan MUST buy them, because these discs are the only way to get decent-looking copies of these comedic geniuses' work.  So, yes I have bought them, and yes, I will buy more of them.  But every time I do, I will bear a grudge against Columbia.

7970330,5,B00006JMQ1,a knockout funny funny collection. Moe Larry Currley and Shemp at thier absolute best.  A MUST HAVE.,1157068800,4,100,4.882352941176471
7970331,5,B00006JMQ1,I got this last Christmas.,1135814400,,26,4.4
7970332,5,B00006JMQ1,"This is the perfect companion to the other Three Stooges DVD collection here, the one that includes the following DVDs: ""Curly Classics,"" ""Spook Louder,"" and ""All The World's A Stooge.""

This set features the DVDs ""G.I Stooge,"" ""Cops and Robbers,"" and ""Three Smart Saps.""

The picture quality varies from short to short, but generally falls into the acceptable range, as does the audio quality. Buying these sets of three will save you a few dollars over buying each release individually.

The short ""Who Done It?"" is included here, via ""Cops and Robbers,"" and is the highest rated short the Stooges EVER did over at ThreeStooges dot net, a popular Stooges fan site.",1130112000,16,666,4.928571428571429
