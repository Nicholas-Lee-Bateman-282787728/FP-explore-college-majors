8429806,5,B004I15IHW,"Excellent DVD set! We bought this at Walmart for the granddaughters when they stay with us, and they love it. The youngest (2yrs, 4 mos) can't get enough of Superman.

The quality is very impressive, especially considering the age of the originals. The favored Superman epsisodes are all dated 1941 or '42, and you'd never guess it when viewing.

I'm posting this to counter the only other review here as of this writing. Unfortunately, that 3-star ""review"" has nothing to do with thsi particular video, yet the writer makes negative comments about it.

I plan to buy another of these sets from Amazon so the granddaughters can have their own copy at home.",1414972800,,656,4.787610619469026
