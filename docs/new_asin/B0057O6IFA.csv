8460897,5,B0057O6IFA,"A must for fans of the classic MIAMI FUNK SCENE, and also of Clarence Reid/BLOWFLY, himself.",1445212800,,92,4.8125
8460898,4,B0057O6IFA,"Why didn't this documentary get a wider national release? Every bit as funny & real as many other ""Rockumentaries"" the last few years, a well deserving subject gets a well made - ""warts n all"" look at his music & life. Worth a look even if you are only familiar w/his Blowfly persona. Take into account Clarence Reid's hundreds of writing & production credits on Southern R&B and Miami Funk hits of 1960's & 1970's and you have yet another look at an American Original; a talented, quirky, ground-breaking artist paid too little and unsung for way too long.",1339804800,,557,4.636363636363637
8460899,3,B0057O6IFA,"First, its great to finally get to learn a bit more about the legend behind the mask... second, the film seems almost as much a self promotional vehicle for his jerky (I can't use the other word on Amazon) drummer and his pals. There are some interesting interviews -- but mainly what we see is an old man who was exploited back in the day, and seems to be the subject of exploitation today.

He can still perform.... but the film in is in-dignifying. He's treated not so much as a ""legend"" but as a cranky old man who simply won't cooperate with the Bowker the drummer/manager's scheme of helping him break through to the next generation by playing new stuff that he's written. In between, there's clips of his gigs (playing mainly before young white audiences, some who do and some who don't seem to know who he is.)

The film reveals interesting stuff about him... including that he's very religious and also has issues with black people, which is a shame,
because if he actually had some brothers of his generation (or people who appreciate his peers of that generation) -- and if he was surrounded by musicians who genuinely respected him and weren't butt heads, perhaps he'd be able to work the RIGHT circuit and be right up there with other R&B legends (or even working the black comedy circuit.

There's also very little footage of him performing back in the day (probably because very little exists), minimal interviews with the artists he worked with -- and the film is totally all over the place, even though its nicely shot and edited.

The director might very well argue that the film was merely an effort to help sell his music to a new generation who don't know his music -- but as Reid (Blowfly) himself says, he's been making music since 1959 and people come to hear that music.  Apparently, the band just isn't that enthused.

Overall, I'd suggest taking the money you would have spent renting this DVD and actually getting some of his classic recordings... It is great that the filmmaker took the time to capture BLOWFLY on film... but please... someone who has some respect for the brother, HELP HIM and give him something that lives up to what he deserves.",1316995200,8,2177,4.612403100775194
