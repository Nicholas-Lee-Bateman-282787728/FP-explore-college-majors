323008,5,6301231848,"Stan and Ollie are the embodiment of friendship. Always together, and despite being at each other's throats from time to time, always there for each other, united against some common foe or against adversity. This film stands out from the rest because it features some truly great music, and is arguably the perfect length for a L & H picture, 1 hour. The boys had trouble in making longer feature films, which tended to flag and become
bogged down in plot, and the shorts left the audience wanting more. But Way Out West keeps entertaining throughout, and showcases the duo's talents perfectly. There's Ollie's fine tenor voice in The Trail Of The Lonesome Pine, and both actors' mastery of business when they get tangled in Oliver's clothes. There's fine support from James Finlayson and Sharon Lynn, and some authentic western saloon sets and exteriors. This is timeless comedy and ought to be compulsory viewing for anyone who thinks black and white stuff dated.",1005523200,3,966,4.932515337423313
323009,5,6301231848,"Laurel & Hardy's feature-length classic has Stan and Ollie trying to deliver a mining deed, while the larcenous saloon proprietor Mickey Finn tries to grab the valuable document himself. This was a lampoon of Gene  Autry's musical westerns then in vogue (1937), so there are three charming  musical numbers performed by Laurel & Hardy. The comedians are at the  top of their game. If you could own only one Laurel & Hardy feature  film, this would be your best bet.",952905600,3,465,4.775
323010,4,6301231848,"When I was younger Laurel&Hardy were my idols! I remember the first time I saw this film,and seen the part were Oliver's head gets stuck in the floor(It's a little to long to explain JUST HOW THIS HAPPENED. If you've  seen the movie you know what part I'm talking about.)Stan tries pick up  Oliver's head by grabing him by his chin and moving upward. He ends up  STRETCHING HIS NECK! And driving oliver's head right through the floor. I  must have tried for years to find someone who would let me do that to them!  Another memorable moment for me is when Stan uses his finger as a lighter!  And oliver makes stan EAT HIS HAT! There are so many great moments in this  film.....you know what I think I'm going to watch it right now!",948153600,,730,4.323529411764706
323011,5,6301231848,"WAY OUT WEST ties with SONS OF THE DESERT as Laurel and Hardy's best feature film. It's a pity it's not currently available on VHS in the United States.  A marvelous parody of Western melodramas, WOW casts Stan and Ollie  as a couple of prospectors charged with delivering a gold mine deed to Mary  Roberts, the daughter of a deceased friend.  When the boys are tricked into  handing the deed over to Mary's villainous guardians, they decide to right  the wrong and rescue Mary. There isn't a wasted moment in WOW.  Highlights  include, of course, Stan and Ollie's comic softshoe, and their duet of  ""Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia.""  The supporting cast  complements L&H, and the movie, beautifully. James Finlayson was never  better as Mickey Finn, the black-hearted saloon owner. Finlayson made a  specialty of parodying the villains of Victorian Melodrama, and here he  pulls out all the stops in a tailor made role.  Sharon Lynne provides  glamourous contrast as his wife and partner in crime, and Rosina Lawrence  plays the sweet and all too trusting Mary Roberts.",943401600,6,1072,4.932584269662922

7810699,5,6301231848,"This VHS ""colorized"" copy was pretty good..the color was o.k. and the sound track was fine..for such an old classic  b/w release colorized.  I think colorized old films are  great. I remember  years back watching some  old classics and thinking, ""some day the industry will be able to color  these""..I ddn't have any idea how , but  everything else  was happening. Yes...the early colorized films were awful with an only brownish, yellow and a bit of red  The new  ways of doing it has been sensational. Many I have seen  are..well..beautiful!  And look as if they were  originally filmed in color. This one is ""pretty"" good.",1388707200,,625,4.783018867924528
7810700,4,6301231848,"Love the movie itself. Laurel and Hardy in color in a solid comedy. The color isn't Wizard of Oz quality, but I thought it was good enough to make them seem more ""real"" when watching with my kids. They hate it when I turn on anything black and white so this is like a gateway to expose them to L&H.

Only complaint is the format of VHS. It simply sucks. My used/very good tape plays, but with a one inch distorted line on the bottom consistently shown. There's simply no getting rid of it. This is one of those tapes that the company churned out in the cheapest way possible by using the worst quality setting in order to save tape. If it would have been recorded on SP instead of SLP, that could have increased playback quality dramatically.

This is a fantastic movie which is why I rated it high. But the VHS format is a crap shoot. Hope you get one that plays OK.",1382400000,,867,4.216867469879518
7810701,5,6301231848,I am a big fan of Laurel and Hardy and anything they do is so funny.  I like the colorized version and would recommend it to everyone.,1347148800,,134,3.962962962962963
7810702,1,6301231848,"My advice is keep your black and white version. Lets see,they colorized The Maltese Falcon.(Blue Skies in a Film Noir?I don't think so)Poor Bogie and Director John Huston. Somewhere they must be frowning.
White Heat The flames on the oil tanker as Cody Jarrett(James Cagney) shoot it out with the TMen,look sort of phony to me.
Out Of The Past. Another disaster. The film was made so you could see the shadows in the background.(Thats Film Noir)The color spoils it. Director Jacques Tourneur obviously didn't want the film done in color.
Getting back to colorized Way Out West. I think the film should have been left alone. Dont mess with Greatness.",1328313600,,649,4.8558558558558556
7810703,5,6301231848,Does anyone know why so many of the minor shorts are available from L&H...but this classic is still only available on VHS?  Is it a public domain film? Why isn't it a Criterion DVD?  Every piece of garbage from last year is available on DVD...but not this...and so many other classics!,1083974400,4,285,4.568627450980392
7810704,5,6301231848,"What I love most about Oliver Hardy is the way that he glances at the audience whenever Stan is doing something 'unbelievably' stupid.  It implies a complicity between him and us, a sense of self-awareness and superiority that is completely unjustified.  It is endearing because it is so wrong-headed - Laurel may be ignorant, but Hardy is deluded: it is he who suffers the most violent knocks; it is he who is humiliated because he knows what humiliation means.
With a cartoon-like inexhaustibility, Hardy undergoes countless indignities in 'Way Out West'.  In his first scene he is being carried on a fur mat by a mule, only to be stranded in a creek.  He is forced to strip off in front of a lady to retrieve an heirloom.  In the various attempts to recover the gold-mine deed on which the action centres, he falls through a shed roof, falls from a balcony, and finds himself the unwilling counterweight to a flying mule.  He gets his head stuck in a trap door, which, when hidden by a bucket, is repeatedly kicked by his enemy, Mickey Finn.  Most hilariously, his and Stan's hiding place in a piano is exposed when Finn hammers a tune and the keys batter them in the face.
'Wild Out West' has been called a comedy Western, but it doesn't truly engage with the classic images, cliches or narratives of the genre.  The heroes may be strangers who ride into a town, but they are neither outlaws, civilisers, hired guns nor men running from their past; they don't transform it before they leave.  'West' is really just another setting for a Laurel and Hardy comedy - the locales could be changed with little alteration, and still be effective.  This doesn't mean that the Western is irrelevant.  The pointed thing about 'West' is the way it takes a genre dependent on action and a kind of mythic grandeur, and slows it down to Laurel and Hardy's grinding, creeping, present-tense pace.  The main fight over the deed involves a childish chase around an apartment by four adults, bruising and scrumming each other, the female villain tickling the deed out of Stan (a weird, suggestively Freudian scene).  The climactic break-in sequence, which should be tense and brisk, stands still for meticulously and patiently developed routines.  Much of the film's pleasures derive from digressions, such as Stan's multi-octave acompaniment to the Avalon Boys' musical interludes, or the local dogs' interest in his shoe.
One of the problems with Laurel and Hardy features is the way their plotless, vignette-accumulating art is trammelled by the need for plot coherence and linearity, the resolution of which depends on a heroism and adeptness that betrays the leads' personae.  'West' is the best of these features because it is their most (comparatively) cinematic; because some care has gone into creating atmosphere (the soundtrack is especially imaginative); because the script is superb; but mostly because it's consistently, even hysterically, funny.",1014336000,11,2946,4.959349593495935
7810705,5,6301231848,"I believe that Laurel & Hardy, in their prime, were a perfect embodiment of the archetype of the Holy Fool. Innocent and optimistic, they seem to inhabit a world removed from the rules of ordinary reality. Forced to interact with the real world, however, they bumble and goof but ultimately prevail by means of that particular brand of grace known only to the fool.
""Way Out West"" (1937) finds my favorite fools traveling westward in search of the daughter (Rosina Lawrence) of an old friend so that they can deliver the deed to a gold mine that he has bequeathed to her. As you might imagine, things don't go exactly as planned and our heroes are soon forced to retrieve the deed from the clutches of a greedy saloon keeper (James Finlayson) and his wife, The Singing Nightingale (Sharon Lynne).
The plot is basic and actually pretty thin, serving really as nothing more than a framework for the gags, mishaps, and antics of Stan and Ollie. This is not a complaint. There is not one false step, comically speaking, in the all too short 65 minutes of this film. The hat eating scene is simply wonderful, and the entire segment where the boys attempt to break into the saloon, ultimately enlisting their mule in the effort, is hilarious (""I wanted to get the mule down."" has become one of my favorite movie lines). Some of the best scenes are actually musical in nature: Stan and Ollie, inspired by the old timey crooning of the western Avalon Boys (""commence to dancin', commence to prancin'"") performing a little dance that has got to be one of the sweetest moments in cinema; Stan and Ollie themselves crooning ""The Trail of the Lonesome Pine"", culminating with Stan unconscious on the floor!
This is classic and timeless comedy, almost profound in its simplicity. Don't be a fool - buy it today.",1005523200,5,1798,4.693037974683544
