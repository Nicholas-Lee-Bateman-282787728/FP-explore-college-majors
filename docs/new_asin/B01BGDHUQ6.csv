8750060,5,B01BGDHUQ6,"Delightful! Saw this charmer at Palm Springs International Film Festival last year, and have been searching for a DVD or Blu-Ray of it ever since (original title in imdb: ""Schweizer Helden""). So glad it has finally gotten released - in R1/A (U.S.A.) even! Great story of immigrants trying to put on amateur stage production of the classic Swiss folk tale ""William Tell."" Nice cast (mix of professional Swiss actors, with most of the immigrants played - quite realistically, and quite charmingly - by actual newcomers), and some nice glimpses of beautiful wintry Swiss scenery. Lots of humor, but also quite touching - and with a great ending. No car chases or explosions, but if you enjoy intelligent, charming, thoughtful films, then I'd say this one is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! (Btw, same director also did ""The Sandman"" a few years earlier - also recommended and available on DVD; And, no, I'm not related to him or anyone associated with this film or DVD - just a fan!)",1454976000,2,968,4.872727272727273
