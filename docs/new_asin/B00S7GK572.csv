8697508,5,B00S7GK572,"This is the more challenging one out of the two baby bundles. This one is for those who are veterans to the Mary Helen Bowers Ballet Beautiful series and can handle more hard work even when pregnant. If you are new, or you have not been working out for a while, please try her Fit & Graceful bundle first before moving on to this one.

So, like my other review, I use these bundles when I suffer from PMS related aches and pain and cannot do her regular workouts due to the fatigue. This bundle has cardio, arms, upper body, legs, thighs, butt, and to a lesser extent, abs. This does not have the bridge series. I know that her Customs Workouts on her website have baby related videos that actually have the bridge series, but they are extremely tough and especially when you're hauling around a big ol' belly on top of that, I'd rather you all try these gentle bundles before you go to her other videos. Just saying! I'm not saying you can't, I'm just saying, BE CAREFUL!

I think Mary Helen Bowers look so beautiful and feminine while pregnant. It is a special time in a woman's life where she can exercise for her own health and the baby's health as well, but it also the time to turn back the dial and to do more easier workouts so as to pace herself and enjoy her pregnancy rather than dread it. And as I said before, these bundles are amazing for ladies who are menstruating and need a more gentle approach as they work through the horrible PMS symptoms. In the end, Mary's videos work for anybody and everybody!",1454544000,8,1518,4.360424028268551

8697510,5,B00S7GK572,"I love Mary Helen Bowers regular Ballet Beautiful series - although as a beginner, and a not-as-active-as-i-should-be individual, I do find the regular ones a bit more challenging. As we're trying for #1, when I saw BB had a prenatal series I knew I had to order them. I originally just purchased the Fit & Graceful Pregnancy bundle - which is a gentle all levels workout that I quite enjoy - even though i am currently just in trying to conceive mode and not actually pregnant yet. I've actually found that it's building up my strength so now when I do go back and try some of the regular Ballet Beautiful series I am definitely showing signs of improvement and able to do more of the workout without pausing for an additional stretch.

Since I am quite enjoying the Fit & Graceful bundle, I decided to also purchase this Energized & Elegant Bundle so I will have a variety of prenatal workouts at my disposal. I knew this one was more challenging but still for all levels - i also read it's for long time Ballet Beautiful users which i am not...but i figured i'd give it a go anyways because a challenging prenatal must still be easier than a regular level BB video. I've only done the mat workout so far on the trimester 1&2 disc for the Energized & Elegant Bundle and it is definitely more challenging than the Fit & Graceful bundle. I can still keep up without needing to pause the dvd but boy does it burn! (that may be though because BB exercises tend to hit all the small muscles i've never worked before). But with MHB's constant stretching throughout it doesn't leave me in pain the following day. I just finish my exercises feeling good.

I am just amazed at MHB's strength for doing all of these exercises not only while pregnant, but with a smile. I find her peaceful demeanor and counting out the sets of 8 easier to follow as I know how many reps are being done and how many sets are to come before i can finally take a much needed stretch since she really works your muscles! - I'm not a fan or workouts where they just start doing a motion but never really give way to when it is going to end. I also actually really like the simplicity of MHBs instructions - she will explain the moves, count them out and prompt for a stretch. I tend to find a lot of other workout trainers will have a constant monologue throughout the entire workout which i don't ten to mind the first time i watch the video, but as you continue to watch the same video, it just get's very repetitive as you know exactly the same spiel they will say throughout. Because MHB keeps it short and simple, I find i don't get tired of her dialogue.

The Energized and Elegant dvds also seem to give more instructions on modifications which I find quite helpful. I don't need the easier/prenatal modifications currently, but I know when i'm sporting a bump they will definitely come in handy. overall i'm excited to try the remaining workouts in this bundle. I've never been one to workout religiously - i always find myself starting new workout routines and never sticking with them, however, there's something about BB that just keeps me going and I actually look forward to doing a half hour to hour workout everyday. I used to take Jazz when I was younger, and always wanted to take ballet but never did, so I think Ballet Beautiful is like my own little guilty pleasure of ""ballet class"" incorporated as a workout. I also bought actual ballet slippers to work out in, because i find it really puts me in the ballet mindset. I know it's not the same as taking an actual ballet class, but it still makes me feel like a little ballerina :)",1447372800,10,3622,4.427286356821589
8697511,2,B00S7GK572,if you don't have any other ballet beautiful disc then it's worth it. personally i don't see anything 'prenatal' about this other than the fact that shes pregnant. since i own the other discs i can do the same modified workout with those.,1438732800,6,238,4.558139534883721
8697512,4,B00S7GK572,"I love Mary Helen Bowers and her gentle philosophy on self-care and exercise. I own two of her other DVDs, and when I found out I was expecting, was eager to try her prenatal selection. Her method is making my body toned and sleek, in just a few short months, in a way that Pilates and yoga haven't after years of devoted practice. So there is that!

Now, to this set of DVDs. It comes with four work outs total: 2 30-minute mat work outs (one for 1st and 2nd trimester) and 2 cardio work outs, broken down by trimester as well. The mat work is interesting for MHB. It's very beginner friendly - she offers more modifications than she does for her other work outs - yet still very challenging, high reps/low to no weight, her usual schtick.

The 'cardio' section of both leaves much to be desired. It's not cardio so much as active moving that may or may not get your heart rate up. As someone who is pregnant and nauseous most of the time, yes, it gets my heart rate up; but back in the day, it would have just been some nice active toning moves. The only downside to it besides that is that it gets really repetitive and boring. She does a lot of lunge variations throughout the cardio set, and it just really gets old. It's boring enough that I docked a whole star.

One thing these DVDs have that I LOVE is two 15 minute stretch sections. They are so relaxing and so important to the Ballet Beautiful method.

If this was the only DVD set you bought your entire pregnancy, you would be very healthy! It works every muscle in your body, relaxes you, and leaves you feeling light and graceful. Most of the time, pregnancy cannot be described as ""light"" and ""graceful,"" so we need all the help we can get. I HIGHLY recommend these videos! Well worth the price. Even if you've never worked out with MHB before, you will fall in love with her and the Ballet Beautiful method and you will buy other DVDs and see your body transform. She's amazing.",1431043200,14,1945,4.335164835164835

My review, then, will be geared towards those of us who are not expecting, but who are interested in purchasing these, as I was. I have only had the chance to preview these so far, but I can tell that I'm going to love these just as much as I love Mary Helen's other Ballet Beautiful workouts. These definitely do not disappoint!

This bundle contains two separate DVDs -- one for Trimesters 1 and 2, and one for Trimesters 2 and 3.  I've included more details on each workout below.

~~~ DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO NEW BALLET BABY SETS ~~~

I ended up ordering both Ballet Baby sets directly from Ballet Beautiful before I even knew what the workouts would be like just because I love the BB workouts so much. I wasn't sure what the difference between the two sets was, but, after hunting around a bit, I found an online article (from _The Daily Mail_) that said this:

""The first series is Fit and Graceful, a more gentle introductory workout designed for women who aren't familiar with Mary Helen's techniques. 'This is for people that maybe are new to Ballet Beautiful, who haven't worked out with me before and want to get started, to change their muscles but in a more sort of gentle way,' she explained.""

The same article also went on to say this:

""For Mary Helen's more experienced students - like supermodel Doutzen Kroes, who trained with her while pregnant with daughter Myllena - there's the more advanced Energized and Elegant series. 'This is the DVD for people who've done Ballet Beautiful for a while,' says Mary Helen. 'So for myself or for someone like Doutzen, who's going into pregnancy already ultra fit and used to a challenging workout.'""

~~~ OVERVIEW INFORMATION ~~~

In each workout on all four DVDs, it's just Mary Helen, and she's in what looks to be her home studio. It's a beautiful space, with flowers in the background and a window. I love how light and cheery the space is, and know it'll be nice to workout with this beautiful background as we head into the winter months. Mary Helen looks radiant and beautiful as always, and it's fun to see her working out while she was pregnant with her daughter Lumina Belle.

As with her other workouts, Mary Helen does four sets of eight for most exercises, and she counts out each rep. This doesn't bother me and I find it meditative, but I wanted to point this out since I know it bothers some viewers. The high rep format is great for hourglass shapes, and last year I had some impressive results when I was just alternating her Ballet Beautiful: Total Body Workout and Ballet Beautiful: Body Blast workouts, with no cardio. I lost weight and leaned up, and had better results in just three weeks of using BB than I did with 42 days of Tracy Anderson.

Classical music from Beethoven and Bach also plays in the background of each one.

To do the workouts on both DVDs, you'll need a yoga mat, a chair or barre, and some light handweights. You can also wear socks, but I love wearing my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Capezio-Women-s-Daisy-Ballet-Shoe/dp/B002CQTY84/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Capezio Women's Daisy Ballet Shoe</a>&nbsp;to feel more like a ballerina. ;-)

~~~ ""TRIMESTERS 1 AND 2"" DISK ~~~

On the main menu, you have an ""Intro to Ballet Baby"" one-minute segment, along with the three main segments of the DVD:

* Mat Workout -- just under 30 minutes
* Standing Work -- about 30 mintues
* 15-Minute Gentle Stretch

There is also the great ""Play All"" feature so you can string all three workouts together.

The Mat Workout has a lot of variation on inner and outer thigh work, along with some leg lifts, where Mary Helen is leaning on a low stool for support. There is also some nice ab/C-curve work.

The Standing Work segment doesn't use a barre or chair, but does use light weights. There is a lot of nice standing leg work, along with some weighted triceps and shoulder work.

In none of the four workouts will you find bridge work, which makes sense since I imagine that it's contraindicated for pregnant women. That being said, I find Mary Helen's bridge work to be excellent for tonight the rear end, so it's worth picking up her Classic or Blasts DVD for the bridge sequences.

~~~ ""TRIMESTERS 2 AND 3"" DISK ~~~

As with the ""Trimesters 1 & 2"" disk, on the main menu, you have an ""Intro to Ballet Baby"" one-minute segment, along with the three main segments of the DVD:

* Mat Workout -- just under 29 minutes
* Standing Work -- just under 30 minutes
* 15-Minute Gentle Stretch

The Mat Workout for this one uses a folded blanket to properly position yourself, and includes some nice lying moves like seated attitude lifts, while also including some kneeling arm work, where you lean to the side and gently work your arms and abs.

The Standing Work uses a barre or chair. The releve work here is similar to the work in some of the other Standing Work series in these new sets, but with minor twists on the moves. There is a nice light cardio factor to these moves, too.

In none of the four workouts will you find bridge work, which makes sense since I imagine that it's contraindicated for pregnant women. That being said, I find Mary Helen's bridge work to be excellent for tonight the rear end, so it's worth picking up her Classic or Blasts DVD for the bridge sequences.

~~~ OVERALL NOTES ~~~

For those who are pregnant, Mary Helen also gives good form pointers throughout, and she also encourages you to think about your belly and your limitations.

In both workouts, Mary Helen does her usual stretches between moves. Although these short stretches may not seem like they're doing much, they really do help keep your legs feeling limber and long. I've also noticed that she does more stretching in all four of the Ballet Baby DVDs than in her previous ones; she holds the poses for longer, too.

The moves are varied enough, though, that these don't feel at all like repeats of her previous four workouts. There are, of course, some repeat moves, but the thing you can't argue with is that these workouts really work.

As mentioned above, I've finally come to learn that low-weight, high-rep workouts work best for my hourglass shape, and all of the leg extensions that Mary Helen does work quickly to slim down my thighs. I also know that Mary Helen also trains some of the Victoria's Secrets models, as well as Alexa Chung, and they always look toned and fit.

Overall, I'm really pleased that I got these! As mentioned at the start of my review, pregnant women may have a different view of this set, but as a non-expecting woman, these two new sets feel fresh to me, and they don't feel like they are just for pre-natal women. I had been worried that these might not be good for non-pregnant women, but that won't be the case at all. They look just as challenging as her non-prenatal, regular workouts.

I've had great results in the past from using just Ballet Beautiful workouts (with no extra cardio), and know that I'll get the same results from these, too! :-)",1425081600,10,7469,4.7793317793317796
