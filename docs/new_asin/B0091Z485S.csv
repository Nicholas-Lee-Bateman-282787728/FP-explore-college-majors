5243035,4,B0091Z485S,"For a 1950's movie, it's a good one. Charlton Heston plays an amercian adventurer with no ethics looking to make a fast buck in Peru.  He makes a living swindling well-off travelers. He has heard the tales of a lost Inca artifact made of gold hidden somwhere at the Inca's ruines, and he hopes to find it and sell it.  His older mentor is just as morally flawed, and will stop at nothing to get his hands on the Inca gold piece.  Along the way, Heston meets a women with a questionable background hoping to go to the states and will use her charm on anyone willing to take her. All three try to scheme their way to fortune, and they end up at the Inca ruins along with an excavation team looking for the lost artifact.  Many write that the movie is a precursor for Indiana Jones. It has some similarities to it, especially the way Heston's character finds the lost Inca gold. I enjoy watching highly flawed characters, it makes the movie more interesting to watch. I love the bar scene, when Heston speaking in Spanish to the bartender, tells the women to pay for the drink, and he doubles the price inorder to get an extra drink. Small scences like this tell a lot about his character. The ending to me is a bit of a let down and the beautiful Peruvian women singing was too much to take. Overall, I assume an older audience would like this, a younger audience are brought up with special effects and fast, cut-up  camera shots.",1383436800,7,1429,4.377358490566038
5243036,4,B0091Z485S,"A less than ethical adventurer (Charlton Heston) works as a tour guide in a secluded but picturesque village of Cuzco in Peru. What he's really interested in though is a bejeweled gold relic buried in a tomb in the Andes. Accompanied by a Romanian refugee (Nicole Maurey), he steals a plane and they make the treacherous climb to Machu Picchu where the tomb is located but they find an archaeological expedition already there digging for the tomb. Great fun! Clearly the source of inspiration of Spielberg's RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, the similarities are too striking to overlook. Especially Heston's costume of a brown leather bomber jacket and fedora hat! The movie isn't laden with the special effects of Spielberg's film, its simple pleasures coming from an often subtly humorous script, Heston's devil may care hero and exotic Peruvian locations. The popular (at the time) Peruvian singer Yma Sumac has a small role and sings two songs in her four octave range (when she hit her high notes, my cat's ear's started shivering!). Directed by Jerry Hopper. With Robert Young, Thomas Mitchell, Glenda Farrell, Marion Ross and Michael Pate.

The Paycom MultiMedia DVD from Spain is a colorful transfer but on the soft side and could have used some cleaning up but it's quite watchable. The DVD has both English and Spanish soundtracks and optional Spanish subtitles.",1376006400,8,1364,5.008810572687224
5243037,5,B0091Z485S,"This is a fun one . Charlton Heston (superb) sports a Unibrow and light beard (rare for the time) through much of the picture . This is a pretty esoteric find . What you need to know . The Romanian woman is a dish . Heston portrays ""the"" Inca Gold seeking model for Indiana Jones (honest , look it up) . Father Knows Best (Robert Young) is an Archaeologist . The unusual , high pitched singing and music from the THE BIG LEBOWSKI sequence that features the semi nude woman being bounced with the hand held trampoline , is here . This and a second complete performance are lip synced by the astonishing Yma Sumac who performed these compositions on her own records . Here she portrays an Inca ritual singer and participant . Thomas mitchell (Scarlett O'Hara's father in GONE WITH THE WIND) is on hand as an older , more crooked version of Heston's character . There's some nefarious activity and the semi noir script is jam packed , to the hilt , with witty and hard boiled one liners and dialog . The actions and conversation with a faux sniper are priceless just by themselves . Herein , you'll find great location photography and truly marvelous sets and set decoration . Anyone failing to give this fascinating picture the full measure , simply does not appreciate or understand what's going on here . Let's cause ""them"" to put this one on DVD or Blu . Great found Heston too . Good times . Great times actually .",1371686400,5,1416,4.45
5243038,4,B0091Z485S,"This is a surprisingly little known film for such a star-studded cast.

Charlton Heston plays a down-on-his-luck Californian stuck in Peru making ends meet by giving sight-seeing tours. His character is the quintessential anti-hero. His character, Harry, is seemingly always scheming to make a big buck off someone or something, whether it be to rip off a tourist or steal an ancient artifact. And that is what the film really revolves around. Harry has a ""missing"" piece of an old clay tablet mapping out the location of an ancient Incan treasure, and he'll do anything to get that treasure for a big payday!

However, in keeping with true anti-hero status, Harry develops a moral-ethical value system as the story develops in no small part do to a beautiful young woman. In many ways, this film is the template for Raiders of the Lost Ark. (In fact, some people believe Raiders is an obvious rip-off.) As a matter of fact, the character of Harry is also very much like the character of Han Solo in Lucas' other hit, earlier hit, Stars Wars.

In any event, the film is a fun adventure yarn from the early 1950's with some footage actually shot on location at Machu Picchu! Not quite a ""classic"" in the sense of Casablanca or other Hollywood fare from years past, but a fine film worth your time watching!",1371686400,3,1305,4.689956331877729
5243039,1,B0091Z485S,"This movie looked and felt like it was made 20 earlier than it actually was made.  The acting was stiff and senseless in many cases.  There were several ""singing"" (and I use the word loosely) scenes that went on for far longer than almost anyone could tolerate.  The only good part were the beautiful pictures from a great setting -- not worth the price of admission though.",1371686400,,374,4.552238805970149
5243040,3,B0091Z485S,"I gave this movie three stars because, well although it is a good movie the plot was not all that great, I didn't think. The movie is about a explorer type person (Charlton Heston) that helps this very attractive women and gets involved in finding a valuable artifact that has some religious importance to the Incas. I would recommend to all the family though.",1370995200,,360,4.640625
5243041,5,B0091Z485S,"This movie was the original Indiana Jones. A rogue living among the natives with a fedora and a leather jacket, add a whip and you'll have Jones. Harry of course is looking for treasure, and just happens to have a map of how to find it. He has connections and knows how to fly a plane. There were little to no special effects and the plot and acting was much better than the latest Indiana Jones. The best part is that the lead is played by Charlton Heston, of 10 commandments and Ben Hur fame, he plays a great rogue. He meets a girl along the way and tells her that he will take her to Mexico because she is trying to make it to America and will cross the boarder from there, he just didn't tell her that they will take a pit stop at machu picchu to find this treasure he's been looking for; a giant gold disk encrusted with gems. Thomas Mitchell played a great villain, earning our sympathy but also making us want to hate him. If you are looking for a great family film that has beautiful scenery (It was filmed on location) and some wonderful performances, give this a try.",1360627200,27,1078,4.237864077669903

Heston here is several years before he played Moses. He was cast as a brutally nasty sort of white hunter who takes no guff from anyone. He played the same sort of guy just a year later in the better film 'The Naked Jungle'. Again he scowls at everyone and stomps around the South American jungle in his outfit.

5243122,3,B0091Z485S,"To start with, in response to numbers of previous reviews, this is no more the source of Indiana Jones  than Marilyn Monroe was the original platinum blonde.
The only reason for most people to see this one is in the cast, terrible as is the material with which they have to work. Thomas Mitchell must have been quite near the end of a career which had marked him as one of the premiere character actors in the Talkies.
Robert Young, here in a thankless role, was fading from films but was at the dawn of a first rate career in television. Charlton Heston had done some fine work but was still not established as the Guy the studio turned to when it needed a Big Man or a Big Picture.
Yma Sumac does get  chance to show a bit of what made her an International Star. The color is brilliant 1950's technicolor which give us just  a glance at some striking scenery. For the rest, the supporting cast offers little, the authors of the screenplay and director of the film were simply going through the motions.
The stars in the cast are the only attraction, really, though only for their place in film history not for this film. If there is little else to see on television, it is worth a look to fill a 90  minute gap. For none of the stars is this a film which offered more than the paycheck as reward their efforts.",1405296000,,1312,4.299595141700405
5243123,3,B0091Z485S,It was fun to watch. I have always liked Charlton Heston.  I just wish that more of his movies were on Prime.,1403568000,,109,3.9545454545454546
5243124,4,B0091Z485S,"I saw this movie in the 60's and loved the story.  No schmaltzy hero, no rescued virtuous damsel, and some respect for the native peoples.  The natives were not deified nor made cartoonish anonymous cannon fodder. The cinematography showed some real appreciation for the camera art and a kiss to some gorgeous landscape. Heston plays his usual gibe macho type who is full of himself and takes on the plight of a woman of dubious background. Robert Young and Nicole Maurey are nice end pieces who don't get caught in the clichd mess of the protagonist and his rival and establish some cultural context. The characters are not overdone and played with a natural feel. It probably plays well with older viewers since there are no  special effects eye candy, no car chases, and no nudity. No review of this movie could leave out the iconic Ima Sumac.  She has some acting chops and, of course, has that ethereal voice which is nicely displayed in forced set pieces. In this context her voice seems appropriate, unlike her pop albums.  I'm a fan of the voice, have two of her albums, but can only take so much of it at one time. Overall, a very nice entertainment which I have wanted to own for some time, and that has been reinforced by recent travel to the land of the Incas.  I reviewed the Region 2 PAL version from Spain.",1403395200,2,1321,4.529411764705882

It's worth watching.",1393545600,12,327,4.190476190476191

5243129,4,B0091Z485S,"I watched this because I had read online that it was an inspiration for Raiders of the Lost Ark, and Indiana Jones.

Still, it was nice to see a Heston film previously unknown to me.",1388793600,3,333,4.475409836065574
5243130,2,B0091Z485S,This movie could have been a classic.  The soundtrack is horrid.  The landscape (shot on location in South America) is great.  The set shots don't equal the landscape. Harry is not Indiana Jones.  This movie just takes far too long to get anywhere and then when it arrives you don't care much.,1388448000,3,293,4.576923076923077
5243131,5,B0091Z485S,"SECRET OF THE INCAS is only mentioned nowadays as the precursor to the Indiana Jones extravaganzas, and on the extremely rare occasions it turns up on television, telemag reviewers always cite the Spielberg action man as being heavily influenced by the hero of this adventure drama. Charlton Heston plays the conman Harry Steele, an ultra-macho adventurer, gigolo, tourist guide and one helluva tough gringo. But whereas Jones is an All-American clean cut explorer, Steele is more of an unwashed exploiter. Heston seemed type-cast in his early movies as unsympathetic anti-heroes, in ARROWHEAD he played the Indian hating racist neo-nazi scout Ed Bannon, and in THE NAKED JUNGLE an overbearing misogynistic South American plantation owner.
Heston was back in the exotic jungles of South America in this colourful, exciting movie, and gives a sturdy performance as the hard-ass Harry Steele. French actress Nicole Maurey is a Romanian refugee on the run from Communist tyranny, and she has to endure the attentions of most of the male characters in the movie. She's a looker and a hooker, but comes a cropper when she tries to work her feminine charms on Heston. Thomas Mitchell, one of the best character actors of them all, is wonderful as the seedy scumbag Ed Morgan. The real star of SECRET OF THE INCAS could be Machu Picchu, the greatest tourist attraction in the whole history of Peru, which is beautifully photographed in all its breathtaking magnificence. Worth mentioning, too, is the rare appearence of Yma Sumac. The enigmatic, highly individualistic Peruvian Songbird with the acrobatic vocal chords chants three folk songs written by her husband Moises Vivanco. Yma Sumac, which means ""how beautiful"" in Quechua, is well named, she possessed the most remarkable voice of the twentieth century. Unfortunately, bizarre synching may detract from your appreciation of her appearence in the musical numbers, but the voice leaves an indelible impression.

SECRET OF THE INCAS contains many notable features and, considering it was the early 1950's, some really saucy dialogue. The movie might not appeal to anyone born after 1980, but middle age film buffs will surely wallow in the old fashioned atmospheric derring do.

This Spanish edition is very good value, especially since the movie has never had a British or American release in any format.",1385942400,,2355,5.211081794195251

Her singing sent chills through my body and touched my heart. I wanted to learn about Peru and her people. I did just that! I also married a Peruvian gentleman and we visited Peru many times. I have taken their cuture into my soul. I've learned to cook their amazing recipes, the people are lovely and very warm. I visited Machu Picchu where I saw the beauty and felt the presence of God. It's a truly spiritual place. If anyone has the opportunity to go to Peru do it. Put it on your bucket list. You won't be sorry.
