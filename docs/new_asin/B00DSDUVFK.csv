5853580,5,B00DSDUVFK,My husband & I are happy that we were able to purchase 4  of Steven Segal's newer movies for the price of 1.  Theses movies have very different but interesting plots with lots of action and suspence.  Stephen Segal fans will not be disappointed!,1429920000,,245,4.5227272727272725

5853584,5,B00DSDUVFK,It's a great set of his direct-to-video releases to add to your collection.,1423872000,,75,4.846153846153846

5853586,4,B00DSDUVFK,"Film packages of Steven Seagal vehicles abound these days, but this one sort of breaks the mold: while other ones either push a handful of his direct-to-video features while including one or two of his theatrical films or are completely made up of the latter, ""Action Classics Unleashed"" was the first compilation to be made up entirely of Seagal's DTV offerings. These are generally considered of lower quality than his earlier features by most viewers and probably won't appeal as much to the average buyer, but for established fans of Seagal, this is a pretty good way to collect four of his lower budget features.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Dawn/dp/B000BRBA92/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Dawn</a>&nbsp;is sort of a middle-of-the-road feature from this era of Seagal's filmography, boasting pretty good production values but disappointingly little action. The story's easy to follow and production glitches are almost nonexistent, though the single hand-to-hand fight in the film is performed entirely by a stunt double, not Seagal. On the plus side, this one's the only feature in this collection to include special features.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Foreigner/dp/B00007JZUP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Foreigner</a>, oddly placed after its sequel on this disc, is the movie that really kicked off Seagal's DTV career and perfectly encompasses a lot of its persistent faults. The story is convoluted, full of double-crosses and characters whose motives are unclear. There's a decent amount of action, but none of it is very good. The cinematography is dreary and boring.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vern/dp/0857687220/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vern</a>&nbsp;has suggested that such ""murky"" spy movies may have reflected Seagal's feelings towards Hollywood at the time, and if that's the case, I'm glad that he seems to be over this phase.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Out-of-Reach/dp/B000255LCK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Out of Reach</a>&nbsp;is one of the unintentionally goofiest of all Seagal's movies. It's about him stopping the trafficking of children in Poland, and the most memorable aspect of the film is the ridiculous amount of dialogue that's been dubbed by a performer who sounds nothing like Steven. Though the story is filled with leaps of logic, I still like the film in general. It's one of a few movies wherein you see him acting prominently with child performers, which brings out a little something extra in his acting repertoire, and the action is serviceable. The finale includes an artistic swordfight.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Today-You-Die/dp/B000A5043S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Today You Die</a>&nbsp;is the most direct throwback to the glory days of action filmmaking on this list. There's a ton of weirdness, including an inconsistent storyline about black magic, but there's also a good deal of fighting, a decent gunfight, and a surprisingly good car chase. Seagal's also the most animated here than in the other three films, really getting into his onscreen partnership with rapper-turned-actor Treach (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-and-a-Bullet/dp/B00006LPC3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love and a Bullet</a>).

Were I judging this compilation as the simple sum of its movies, my rating would be a star lower, but on its own terms, this is a decent sampler of the Buddhist Bonecrusher's work from 2003 to 2005. I can't recommend it over his better-known work, but especially for fans who want to complete their collections, this one is worth a purchase.",1387497600,5,3780,6.346303501945525
