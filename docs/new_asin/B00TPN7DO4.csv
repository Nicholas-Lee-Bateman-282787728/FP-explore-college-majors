7015602,5,B00TPN7DO4,Cesar at his best.  The format was a little different than last year's 911 and I liked it!  This was a really touching success story for the family as well!,1425081600,,156,4.166666666666667
7015603,5,B00TPN7DO4,"Ceazar really knows what he is doing. He is amazing and the  lady on video , she was right having a dog is not disposable, like many people think it is , by turning  a dog to the shelter for not behaving well, or whatever.

Great episode.",1425081600,,238,4.0212765957446805

7015677,5,B00TPN7DO4,Cesar is still the best trainer I have ever found to model after. He continues to grow and has a even softer gentle nature with the dogs. I am always amazed how dogs respond to him and others who use his techniques. My dogs behave better just watching the show with me LOL.,1433721600,3,273,4.169811320754717
7015678,5,B00TPN7DO4,"it doesn't get better than learning from Cesar Millan.  He has taught me so much through his dog whisperer and cesar 911 series.  anyone who wants to be a leader to their dogs and in their lives in general with people as well, then learn from Cesar.  His shows are like school to me.  Kathy, Canine Behaviorist",1432944000,,310,4.385964912280702
7015679,4,B00TPN7DO4,"always love Cesar! Kinda miss the Dog Whisperer format... because neighbors and friends are tattling on ""bad dogs"" there seems to be a disproportionate amount of aggressive cases. I miss the parade of eccentric dogs and their neurotic owners a little bit.",1432944000,2,255,5.095238095238095
7015680,1,B00TPN7DO4,"Thank you, Cesar! I am a mom of a 1.5 year old and 4 rescues. Our morning walks are always fun now. People can't hardly believe I can walk so calmly with 2 pitbulls, a husky, and a schnoodle, all while pushing the stroller. They call me the dog mom. Thanks for giving me the tools to be a calm and assertive pack leader (and parent).",1431993600,4,333,4.0606060606060606

7015733,5,B00TPN7DO4,"This last episode was a little upsetting to see the black German Shepherd Tasi's unbalanced behavior due to an unbalanced handler.  Near the end, Tasi's handler said she saw potential in her dog, not realizing the focus on ""potential"" should be on herself.  She also commented that horses are ""dumb, stupid animals.""  I can not believe the show aired that comment, considering it highlighted an extra ugly side of the female handler.  Poor Tasi.  I am sorry for all dogs who, through no fault of their own, end up with such oppressive, negative environments.",1427587200,,558,4.8936170212765955
