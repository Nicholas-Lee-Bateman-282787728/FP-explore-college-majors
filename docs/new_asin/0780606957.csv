30753,3,0780606957,"IN THE 1ST SEQUEL, KID GOES TO COLLEGE BUT, REALIZES THAT HE LEFT HIS COLLEGE MONEY WITH PLAY WHO'S GIVEN THE MONEY AWAY TO A CON ARTIST CLAIMING TO BE A RECORD COMPANY EXECUTIVE. MOST OF THE FUNNIEST MOMENTS COME FROM MARTIN LAWRENCE, WHO RETURNS AS BILAL. THIS SEQUEL IS A LITTLE BIT MORALISTIC AT TIMES, WHICH IS NOT WHAT THE HOUSE PARTY TRADITION IS ABOUT. ESCAPES A TWO STAR RATING ONLY BECAUSE IT IS THAT MUCH BETTER THAN THE NEXT TWO HOUSE PARTIES THAT WOULD FOLLOW.",1059177600,,473,4.448275862068965
30754,3,0780606957,"This movie was disappointing, although not a total washout. Martin Lawrence as Bilal still made me laugh, but some of the scenes had recycled jokes and even preachy tones. The scenes where Kamron (of Young Black Teenagers) as Jamal, a white kid who talks black, shows up were so gimmicky it was scary. But one funny scene was when the party was hopping from apartment to apartment while Boyz II Men's ""Motownphilly"" was playing in the background. Still, all of the best jokes were given away in the trailers, and they weren't even all that funny. The following two sequels are even worse, so just stick with the first House Party.",1043366400,2,630,4.684684684684685
30755,4,0780606957,"House Party 2 proved to be just as good as the first.  The characters were better and the dialouge and plot made more sense but the lack of his foul mouthed father really crippled it's rating.
This movie delivers a better message than the first but the lack of Robin Harris really sucks (he died shortly after the House Party movie)  However Jamal can be funny yet utterly offensive (he is a white guy who thinks he is black).
Lots of messages and innuendos in this movie to convince the viewers to stay in school.  Recoomended to troubled youths.",987206400,,547,4.505050505050505
30756,3,0780606957,"Like most sequels, this one pales in comparison to the original.  It's still entertaining, but gets bogged down with heavy-handed social messages at every turn.  The first movie was so good because it was all about fun.  This one seems to be little more than a social commentary with a gratuitous party thrown in.",970876800,,313,4.7592592592592595
30757,1,0780606957,"I haven't a clue what those other reviewers saw, but what I was watching was a dredfull attempt at regaining the spunk that was in the first movie.  I had the best sleep in weeks when I saw this movie in the theater ten  years ago. I (stupidly) tried to see it the second time on television  thinking that maybe I've missed something.  What a waste! I saw why the  Hudlin Brothers didn't want anything to do with this hack.",946944000,,423,4.2375

Good soundtrack can't complain about that : )",1346198400,,169,4.451612903225806

30819,4,0780606957,"House Party 2 doesn't live up to the first film but it's still a funny film. While the charcters haven't grown much since the first film Kid is still head strong and Play is still a lothario, the film does expand Martin Lawerence's part and features a cameos by Ralph Tresvant and Tony Toni Tone. If you want harmless fun check this one out.",1221350400,,341,4.34375
30820,2,0780606957,"To begin, House Party 2 is no House Party.  In fact, those that would like to compare the two are completely off their hypothetical film ""rocker"".  These are two completely separate films.  Do you know why?  What originally began as a film about some soulful and youthful teens trying to get to the ultimate dance party has now transformed into this clich morality tale that demonstrates the power of friendship and the strength of humility.  WHAT!  Is that why I wanted to watch this film?  I apologize, but one of the few reasons that I liked House Party was because they followed the K.I.S.S. method (for those unfamiliar it is the Keep It Simple Stupid method) of filmmaking.  In the original, becoming a lyricist, a ladies man, and having the best party in town was the root of the film.  While there was a romantic side to the story, it fell second nature to the growing hip-hop scene.  It was a dance film first, developed character story second.  Honestly, that is what I enjoyed about the film.  While I didn't think House Party was the greatest release of the century, it did have this genuine feel about it.  In fact, after watching this poorly crafted sequel, I have a bit more respect for the original.  Where was the dancing?  Where was the creativity?  Where was the same Kid & Play that I remembered from the first House Party?  They were nowhere to be found in this trashy sequel.

Robin Harris.  We all remember him as ""Pop"" from the original film, but what we do not realize about this humorous comedian is that he subsequently changed the image of the House Party series.  In the original, he was this father trying to steer his son into a path of academia instead of rap and parties, in the sequel, he plays a spirit who annoyingly hounds Kid throughout the film with flashbacks from the original.  Due to his death, he brings nothing new to the table, yet this entire sequel seems to be focused around those few short words that he used in the first film.  I don't mean to be rude, but I never felt that the father was such a big element in the original.  I thought that Kid trying to challenge authority to attempt to find himself was the underlying meaning of the original, while in this one it is Kid repressing his true self in hopes to make his dead father happy.  Where did the lightness of the original go?  I watched House Party 2 thinking that there is a limit that the writers could go without making Kid seem totally whipped by his father's words, but we never hit that limit.  Where, anywhere in this film, was Kid trying to find his rap roots?  I needed to see a young man still interested in becoming the lyricist that he once desired to be?  Why did he have to grow up so fast?  In fact, the rap side-story to this film seems to be the negative element.  We have gone from loving the genre to completely disrespecting it in one film.  Ah, the power of the sequel.

Martin Lawrence was again completely annoying to the point in which I completely tuned him out whenever he spoke.  He brought nothing to the story and nothing to the main characters.  Lawrence was nothing more than a familiar face for the audience to relate to.  In fact, it is that dedication to familiar faces from the original that hurt this sequel.  When the ultimate PAJAMA JAM finally does occur (one hour into this short film), we are hit with an barrage of repetitive scenes of aged rappers and comedians from the original who do nothing but repeat their lines, actions, and emotions from the first.  While many may enjoy these familiar faces, I felt as if it were a cheap trick used to make me feel more comfortable about the film.  If these minor characters had done more than just repeat their lines, than maybe I would have bought into the trick, but instead all I saw were cheap repetitive motions used by writers to fill time.  I used the word ""repetitive"" several times in this paragraph because it demonstrated the annoying repetitive nature of this film and completed my point about using that element as a cheap trick.  I hope it worked.

In most television series, especially the cheapened kind, we sometimes hear a laugh track or a sound machine used to create some ""zany"" or ""wacky"" sound that lightens the mood and creates the viable laugh point.  In House Party 2, I do believe that the sound guy was extremely drunk or possibly working his first day in the booth.  There were more sound effects in this film than in a Bobby McFerrin music video.  Was this a child's movie or another urban comedy?  Neither Kid nor Play could do anything in this film without a ""zip zim"" or a ""whoosh"" or a ""ding dong"" noise happening somewhere in the background.  This was a fresh element to the sequel which direly needed to be taken away.  There is a chase scene near the end of the film which felt like Pee-Wee Herman choreographed it with all the unsettling sounds that were happening.  After the first twenty minutes of this, it because increasingly annoying to the point of insanity.

Overall, this sequel soils the original.  The themes were sporadic (i.e. in one instance we are talking about the oppression of the African American, while in the other the directors seem to be building age-old stereotypes), the characters continued towards their bland downward spiral, those annoying, randomly placed racist police officers were back, and the dominating ""father"" element seemed too serious for the overall theme of this film. I hope this film wasn't an indication of the path of colleges in the future?  House Party 3, don't fail me now!

30821,5,0780606957,"Kid'N'Play are going to college, well just mainly Kid, to leave the world of problems. While there Kid learns the lesson of responsibility....the hard way. Play gives Kid's college money to a beautiful, yet crooked music promoter (Iman). And with Sidney want to see new people, Kid comes to Play with help and come up with a PAJAMA JAM PARTY.

Now that's why this movie is way better then the first one and a little bit more funnier.",1130025600,,433,4.551282051282051

Also, I felt this movie was very on the nose with the ""BLACK"" thing. Not that that's a problem but it felt a bit forced at times. Jokes rehashed from the first one. Idk who directed this one but for me it's the worse of the 3. I don't count the 4th one because it doesn't exist :)",1448582400,,408,3.9878048780487805
