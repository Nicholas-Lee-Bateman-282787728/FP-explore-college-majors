7756257,5,B01G71NN3Q,I just saw this today and absolutely fell in love. This is exactly how a slow burning movie should be constructed. It was the best theater experience I've had in a long time. The third act hit hard with madness and blew me away.,1466726400,4,228,4.204545454545454
7756258,5,B01G71NN3Q,"INCREDIBLE imagery throughout! Felt as if I was in a trance in many scenes. You could really tell how each frame was crafted to perfection. Cinematography, score and production design are all Oscar worthy. In many ways, I'd consider The Neon Demon this generation's Suspiria. I will admit the film certainly takes a dive after about halfway and there is really no sense of direction, but it was not a problem for myself. If you are a visual movie-goer like me, I HIGHLY recommend it; if you are considering watching out of curiosity, I'd say proceed with caution",1466467200,5,562,4.744897959183674
7756259,5,B01G71NN3Q,I like it because that has beautiful woman's lovers and together in bed.,1466121600,4,72,4.615384615384615

7756261,5,B01G71NN3Q,"Although the ending of this movie made me very angry, the getting there was pretty amazing. Once I started this I couldn't keep my eyes off it. This is one of the best more recent horror films I have seen in a while. It's actually too much to get into here. Suffice to say that I would definitely recommend you adding this to your collection. Also if you didn't like this you shouldn't bother with the horror genre. You don't belong.",1536192000,,433,4.3580246913580245

7756267,4,B01G71NN3Q,"I liked this movie. Honestly the only reason I watched it was because KR was in it. He played an slime ball in this. He was good, gross character. Well done Keanu, wish he was in it more. The movie was way out there, weird and artsy fartsy  which is not my thing but I got it. I actually got the art of it. I thought it was interestingly weird and so out there I was riveted to keep watching this high on drugs movie to see what would happen to the girl. It was a trip. Disturbing, artsy, weird, cool, off. It shows the vampire that Hollywood is. Unless you have a good head on your shoulder and not keep good people around you, Hollywood will eat you. This is not a normal movie. If you expect a normal movie you might not like it. This is a weird artsy movie showing the realities of innocence being killed off by Hollywood or the fashion world which is the same thing basically, to me anyways.",1534464000,,896,4.12
7756268,1,B01G71NN3Q,"Comes off like a horror movie or at least a thriller. It isn't. It's a high-school drama played out in the modeling world. Excellent cinematography, but in spite of that it is a terrible movie. About as easy to follow as the poetry of Gertrude Stein.",1533945600,,250,4.456521739130435
7756269,1,B01G71NN3Q,I got about 3/4 of the way through before I got so bored and disinterested that I had to turn it off. What a pretentious film.,1533859200,,126,3.8846153846153846

7756273,5,B01G71NN3Q,Not sure how anybody could sample his work and review it as an extension of typical Hollywood. This is most definitely not a film directed towards a standard audience. I love Refn's films based on the fact that he conjures scenes and situations that are sensationally abstract and yet retain a motive for immediate intimacy within human boundaries. There's a feeling of absolution with the script because words are not wasted and his characters say what would normally be said albeit most of which take place in abnormal situations. It is imperative that one views his pictures with an open mind and an active sense of humor.,1532736000,,625,4.850467289719626

7756277,1,B01G71NN3Q,so did anyone notice one huge flaw in this movie? other than it obviously sucked - no i'm talking about the idea of a model eating a human eyeball. models are usually stereotyped to have some kind of eating disorders and no way would they risk the calories of eating a human eye. not sure of the nutritional values exactly tho i'd think its low calorie. it seems to me that the director is incapable of writing a simple good script so he resorts to shocking ideas and themes to draw attention to this movie.,1531699200,,507,4.347368421052631
7756278,2,B01G71NN3Q,"I kept hoping there would be a main character switch like in The Place Beyond the Pines, and maybe tell the story of the mountain lion that broke into her motel room.

7756279,1,B01G71NN3Q,Seemed interesting at first until it got really strange. Seems the writer was trying  too hard to make it artistic and unique. I hated the ending because it made me highly nauseous,1531612800,,180,4.625

7756290,5,B01G71NN3Q,"I'm glad I took the chance to watch this despite the ratings. I really enjoyed it, and have seen it a few times now. It is abstract and has a pretty simple message about the issues with vanity and the modeling industry specifically. But personally, I found it entertaining and the acting was on point from all the actors / actresses. Keanu Reeves did a great job; his character was horrible yet hilarious at the same time.

POTENTIAL SPOILERS AHEAD

There's pretty much one sane character (the amateur photographer) and everyone else is psycho or becomes corrupted in some way. But the characters were pretty interesting. There were a lot of strange things that were a bit ""what...?"", but it worked for a more abstract film. I also think it was clever how the woman who warned Jesse at the beginning to watch out for the male photographer and that ""it's good to have good girls around"" was ultimately the one who was the worst psycho of all.",1529971200,,941,4.595238095238095
7756291,5,B01G71NN3Q,"It was trippy, disturbing avant garde and a bit horrific. Ive never seen these elements brought together in a movie. I'm even considering buying it for my collection. It's a different kind of movie and you should give it a watch.",1529884800,,229,4.609756097560975

7756295,2,B01G71NN3Q,"I guess this is what men think art is? Between all the hot lesbian sex, the nonsensical story, the heavily trope-driven art direction, and disgusting stuff (including implied rape of a 13 year old), I'm giving it a hard pass.

Not because art should be censored. But because the ""artsiness"" doesn't overcome the terrible subject matter or narrative. Disappointing, because I loved Drive and movies like it.",1529452800,,406,5.059701492537314
7756296,1,B01G71NN3Q,"One of the worst movies I have ever seen. And yes, the modeling/fashion industry is cut throat, at least it was in my day. Having said that, the acting was atrocious and the ending left with nothing. Oh, and models aren't washed up at 20. That statement alone is rediculous. Dont waste your time with this poor excuse for a film.",1529452800,,329,4.409836065573771
7756297,1,B01G71NN3Q,"I don't even know where to begin! I guess I'll start with the only thing that I liked, this movie is visually stunning but clearly it was created around the cinematography which is sort of funny (perhaps even ironic) because it seems like it's trying to caution people from putting so much emphasis on beauty versus substance so...lol that this movie is literally more about beauty than substance. Unless Mr. Nicolas Winding Refn truly believes that beauty is all that matters... Meet Jessie, your typical pretty idiot with zero agency what-so-ever in a story of ""Wah! I'm so pretty and that's so hard because everyone's mean because they want to be me or bang me!"" and then meets a random, unnecessarily grotesque end. Also, to all the people claiming Jena Malone did a great job...I guess. If you're cool with lesbians being portrayed as ice cold, sex-starved monsters then, yeah, STELLAR performance from Malone. This whole movie shows women as beauty-obsessed and men as predators. Maybe in LA this is true. What a horrible place! Why people are so desperate to move there, I'll never understand but anyway, back to this awful movie. There are no likable characters at all. And what the heck is the moral? If you're a despicable person willing to do terrible things you can have it all? Gee, that's the kind of uplifting message we need to hear more often! Said no one ever...",1529280000,7,1380,4.7782426778242675
7756298,1,B01G71NN3Q,"I wanted to like this movie so much but I really didn't.  It's SO slow.  Not just the pacing but everything.  It's like the whole movie is in slow motion.  Even during 'action' scenes, it's still so damn slow.  I've never fallen asleep for a movie before and this one I was really fighting to stay awake.  The story isn't good enough to keep you captivated so the added speed is torture.  It's a movie I would put on in the background of an art gallery on mute as eye candy but I couldn't sit through it again.",1528761600,,510,4.142857142857143

7756301,3,B01G71NN3Q,"I knew nothing about the movie prior to watching it other than Dakota Fannings little sister is the star and its supposedly directed by a famous, cult director, or something. With those two credentials,  I wasn't expecting much.  It exceeded my expectations, but not by a whole lot.  I was surprised by how well it stayed together as a whole movie.  I was hooked from beginning to end, with only a few scenes that left me questioning, WTH?  I think the problem is the movie lack substance.  Both in the subject matter and in the performances.  Seinfeld was a show about nothing, this was a movie about nothing, with blood and sex.",1527638400,,630,4.571428571428571

7756304,3,B01G71NN3Q,"It definitely captured the cold environment of the fashion industry. The silent cruelty. But instead of me feeling for the main character and me wanting to get her to avoid the sharks, the main character, being the ultimate ingenue cliche, was bland and the framing was narcissistic. I really hated the girl by the end of the movie. I ironically liked the three evil witches/ models better. I found literally every model but the main character interesting. Thats no dig at the actress but at the cliche framing. I think virginity is only exciting to people who are seriously depraved and I didn't see this constantly mentioned it factor because she was shrowded in artifice, the little girl artifice and then the grown sexy girl artifice. All the actors we good though stylistically alittle thick during the begining. I did not like that ALL the older, experienced women were portrayed as evil. But then again none of the characters were good so... I was happy with the ending. Moral of the story, in a pit of wolves the strongest and the craftiest survive. Narcassists who are so carried away with the smell of their own ... to notice when they are getting set up from the beginning don't last long.  I can appreciate the occult references but this would have been a better music video.",1527292800,3,1287,4.72
7756305,1,B01G71NN3Q,Horrible.  I don't event get the point of this movie at all.  Far from thriller and no one is likeable.,1527292800,,103,4.1
7756306,1,B01G71NN3Q,"I think this director was trying to get the weird tone and mystery of director Dario Argento's Italian horror cult film Suspiria, BUT DO NOT SEE THIS FILM AND EXPECT TO BE SATISFIED OR MOVED OR SCARED OR ANYTHING.  IT'S A BORE.  Fanning and the other actors try to make a go of the bland and unsurprising material, but they cannot overcome bad writing by a director who seems to be trapped by his own fixation on style (in this case over substance)I loved drive.  Style worked, but the director hasn't evolved.  do not stop for this one, not even a pit stop.  If I could get my money back from Amazon, I would.  I kept waiting for something to happen...  nothing happens.  nothing makes sense, except I think he director is going for a horror classic",1527206400,4,750,4.423357664233577

7756316,5,B01G71NN3Q,"The Neon Demon is my new favorite movie. I guess I understand this film in part because I'm half Danish and secondly, because it is a spectacle of visual and auditory marvel and sometimes we need something more than a spoon-fed plot. One could say the film is self-indulgent and difficult to understand, but the people who say that probably go to Disneyland every year for vacation and they don't matter at all in the greater scope of free and creative cerebral eruption.",1525305600,,471,4.686746987951807
7756317,5,B01G71NN3Q,"If you're looking for something to just put on in the background because your bored... find another movie. Like the other films this director has made, the movie takes a moment to digest. It relies heavily on the visual metaphors and cinematography to lay out the plot, more than the dialogue. So if you're doing anything but glued to the screen, you're going to miss why everything happens. The main protagonists could have been casted a bit better in my opinion.

7756319,5,B01G71NN3Q,I can see why people wouldn't like this movie. It subverts a lot of traditional movie-watching expectations. But honestly I really like it.

7756320,3,B01G71NN3Q,"Somewhat interesting and artsy. Very shallow and vapid, but it is about the modeling industry, jealousy, and the LA scene. It might have helped to show a bit more character development. Even though I didn't like any of the characters, I found Ruby (Jena Malone) the most interesting out of the whole movie. I agree with many others about the cinematography and visual elements as the highest points of the film. I think they could have cut some of the scenes, or shortened them, or just explained a little more about the culty connection with Ruby and the two other models, or even expounded on more of the cultish events that might help explain their behavior, especially the final scene. I think it could have been better if a few things were clarified.",1523404800,3,755,4.684210526315789

Managing to watch this movie to the end, without skipping parts is very hard. Parts of this movie were psychedelic and experimental set to a bizarre soundtrack. It's a non-witty tale into classicism and cannibalism. They explain the reason behind eating models so poorly! I doubt 25% of people who dare to watch this horrible film will pick up on.

The music was great reminded me of the original Tron soundtrack, but much more unnerving. I think people that complain about the plot where looking for too much of a mainstream thriller.

Some contradictory moments that are out of character for the characters, a lot of non-sense.

I like a lot of ""bad"" movies, I have my guilty pleasures as much as the next guy, but this takes ""bad"" to a whole new level of contemptible.  I've no problem with literal blood and gore, or horror / suspense in general.  This isn't either, it's a different kind of satire, a mockery of any decent horror / thriller.  Not as in humor, as in parody, but rather, as just a pale imitation of the worst of the worst.

This is what an artist would make if they had no clue how to write or direct.  Remember seeing kids, or perhaps yourself making popcorn ropes for decorations?

Themes include beauty, vanity and women's twisted perceptions born from a patriarchal society and industry in which we are often valued only for our looks. The characters are empty, desirous and sad creatures but they are caricatures of facets which live within us all.

7756386,5,B01G71NN3Q,"This stylish, compelling art film is as cruelly beautiful as the women it portrays--a glimpse into the darkest corners of the human psyche.  You do not need to be an expert on the modeling industry to know that it is a harsh world where those who work are also the objects, that chews many people up and spits them back out again, profoundly changed and often broken.  It is arguable that it's unavoidable in an industry where flawless appearance is your career and livelihood.  When everyone working is equally beautiful by most people's assessments, what else can these women do to get ahead of each other except eat each other alive?
""The Neon Demon"" seeks to examine this in startling, often horrific detail, to incredible effect.  It shies away from nothing, but the actual plot and events in the movie are only half of the real story.  Look beyond the surface level to see what these events really represent--this movie urges you to look past the literal and into the symbolic, even as the literal events may shock and disturb you.  Discomfort on the part of the viewer is intentionally created and it is extremely effective.  You will want to look away, but be unable to tear your gaze from the screen!  Switching abruptly from the real to the dreamlike and back again, the music and visuals are captivating on their own.  But, there's truth in the old cliche--the most beautiful people can sometimes be the ugliest on the inside.  This is not a film for the faint of heart or those who just don't want to look so deeply into this darkness.  Disturbing content abounds.  Proceed only if you are ready for that.
This movie will leave you thinking about it long after the credits have rolled.  Those who are not interested in deep thought will get much less from this movie--it requires and rewards deeper contemplation.  Like many truly great pieces of art, it remains in your mind and gets under your skin.
If what I've talked about so far has intrigued you, I encourage you to watch.  Peer into the neon lights and be blinded by the darkness you find within.

(By the way, I think to categorize this as a horror thriller isn't especially accurate.  I believe Amazon Video should have a separate ""Art Films"" category for movies like this.)",1515628800,,2246,4.659898477157361

7756409,3,B01G71NN3Q,"Well, that was pretty to look at, but not much else. Elle Fanning did a great job on her acting. Plot-wise there could have been way more to this. I would have preferred a story that was more realistic overall (especially towards the end). The issue was that it didn't really exude a feeling of horror throughout the movie. Then, towards the end of the movie,  ""WHAM!!!!"" suddenly its a horror film where models eat others for their youthful attributes.  It would have been better if they had built up to that idea. Otherwise, the ending is just random and you are left thinking ""What the heck? That came out of nowhere (@_@)"". Also, the scenes that were supposed to be symbolic (or whatever it was) were way too long and added hardly anything to the plot. Overall, it left me feeling rather empty, but it was OK (if you have some time to kill or are just curious).",1512864000,,865,4.433962264150943
7756410,5,B01G71NN3Q,"Visual poetry and metaphor. This movie is not trying to tell a traditional narrative, rather telling a story through visuals and raw emotional presentation. One might even say the presentation is as ""shallow"" as the characters themselves and the world they inhabit. You won't like any of the characters, you won't like the conclusion. But you're not supposed to--some stories aren't crafted to coddle you and your sensibilities, but rather display a side of people and/or life you'd rather pretend didn't exist (though this movie goes a step further than normal reality, perhaps crossing over into myth/occult).

Only those looking for a unique experience should apply to this one. Even then it might not click with you, as is the norm with Refn's films. Movies like Drive show that he can be more cohesive when he wants to be, but I still enjoy his style even when he isn't. Style over substance? To some degree. Though I think people are missing or glossing over what substance this movie does actually possess. 4.5/5 from me.",1512864000,10,1028,4.908045977011494

(In particular, almost every fashion scene or photo shoot, which dissolves into complete abstraction). There are also a couple great surrealistic images and touches.

Unfortunately, both the story and the ""message"" of the story are thin and overly simple/amateur feeling, which makes this movie paradoxically boring. If there isn't anything to chew on -- then the style and pacing has little to support it.

As an L.A. movie, it presents great atmospheres of the city, but suffers in comparison to the dreamscapes of Mullholland Drive or its opposite La La Land.

Three stars instead of one or two, because of the scenes that do make it worth it, the technical craft, and especially the score, which might be one of Cliff Martinez's best. The film is technically well made -- set design, lighting, cinematography, and acting. Each performer did a great job, especially considering some of the dialogue. All this said, I still look forward to what NWR does, even when they are misses rather than hits (""Drive"" for example, is one of my favorite contemporary movies).

**SPOILER ALERT** The three women do end up devouring her (I guess literally) in the end, but it takes FOREVER to get there, and it's not like they really actively terrorize her.

I couldn't figure out if we were supposed to feel sympathy for Jesse or if she had some kind of shocking secret of her own that would be the twist, but by the end I was fine that she died.

The one thing you can expect is excellent cinematography, a great sound track, and a visually stunning movie from start to finish. Elle Fanning plays her part admirably and does not hold the film back in any way, but the true star is Jena Malone. Malone has an excellent performance and truly elevates those around her throughout the movie until her, um, shocking climax (literally). Now, I must admit, I did not really like this movie the first time I saw it and I believe it's because I was fighting the movie. Fighting the plot, the characters, the story, and ultimately the ending. The movie lingered with me though, as do most of Refn's films, and I was compelled to re-watch it. On my second viewing I let the movie take me and it was a fantastic ride. From the very start it will draw you into this strange underworld of modelling and like a strange dream it will take you places you don't expect, but it's one hell of a ride. The camera work is excellent and Refn has an incredible eye for framing shots and utilizing colors to enhance the experience. The soundtrack fits what's happening on screen perfectly and overall strong performances by all, including a crazy cameo by keanu reeves. It's hard to recommend this movie to everyone and this is horror in the more subtle way (the good way). There are no jump scares with a loud swell of music to ""scare"" you. It's the type of horror that makes you realize there are awful things happening in this world that should horrify you and I believe the film offers an excellent sense of unease. Overall this is a film that will be hated by most, loved by few and that's okay.

The cross cut scene of 'Malone making out with a corpse' & 'Fanning being sensual on a couch' wasn't morbidly arousing, it was just artsy is the lamest possible way.
I imagine the writer was so excited when he came up with the mountain lion/cheetah scenes, ""omg... and ALLEGORY!!!! I JUST WROTE AN ALLEGORY!!! Just like what Mr. Jacobs was talking about in Eng Lit 101"".
Someone involved in the movie has a huge boner for Elle Fanning, the same awkward way Quentin Tarantino did for Uma Thurman in the 90s, it was annoying.
So the movie ends at 1 hour and 30 minutes and then jumps the shark into splatter porn waters for another 30 minutes. If you like Lady Gaga then this is probably your jam.
When I was 18 this would have been my favorite movie. Morale of the story, inner beauty gives someone outer beauty, vanity is nothing more than an attractively painted corpse. Today I give this movie a ""blaugh""",1505692800,,1527,4.597069597069597

7756490,4,B01G71NN3Q,"With ""The Neon Demon"", director Nicolas Winding-Refn seems to have come to the end of a trilogy which began with ""Drive"" (2011) and continued through ""Only God Forgives"" (2013). The idea seems to be to take genre flick styles -- car action, revenge, and horror -- and to unravel them to the point where they become pure sensation, almost abstractions.

""Drive"" was more of a ""normal"" film, but even so, it was less about its Hollywood stuntman-by-day, getaway-car driver-by-night story than it was the reverie of motoring through L.A. at night in a blur of shimmering neon and chrome to the sound of super-cool synthwave. The Bangkok-set ""Only God Forgives"" looked like a dive into that city's fight-club & go-go bar underground, but played out like a trippy internal exploration of the Oedipal urge, with star Ryan Gosling lost in its womb-like maze of red corridors.

And now we come to ""The Neon Demon"", which is superficially about the fashion industry, its dog-eat-dog Darwinism, and the idea that beauty is in the eye of the beholder -- something which Refn makes nauseatingly literal by the last reel. While more coherent than ""Only God Forgives"" -- and mercifully absent that film's sleepwalking performance style -- ""The Neon Demon"" is soaked in surrealism, more nightmare than narrative, some sort of bastard witch-house hybrid of '80s French ""cinema de look"" and Italian horror.

Elle Fanning plays Jesse, a wide-eyed, underage naif with the looks of a porcelain doll who's come to L.A. with big dreams of being a model. She stays in a seedy motel with an even seedier owner (Keanu Reeves) and befriends Ruby (Jenna Malone), a make-up artist she meets at a test shoot with photographer Dean (Karl Glusman), who wants to hook up with her. Out clubbing with Ruby, she meets professional models Sarah and Gigi (Abbey Lee Kershaw, Bella Heathcote), who instantly catch the scent of new competition and turn up the bitch-face.

Jesse's agent (Christina Hendricks) lands her a photo shoot with a top photographer, which takes on an ominous ritual quality. Later, in an absolutely phenomenal piece of pure cinema , Jesse has her triumphant glitter moment on the catwalk, before falling into some sort of tranced-out communion with a strobing neon triangle. It's the runway walk as 21st century voodoo ceremony, as composer Cliff Martinez' synth-driven score moves from glistening bliss to churning, queasy bass.

This is pretty ""out there"" cinema, and if the ""blue box"" scene in ""Mulholland Drive""was too much for you, don't even think about going there. Fans of the occult will have a field day; look for that thaumaturgic triangle to reappear subliminally throughout the film, even in the way the actors are positioned in a fateful scene at an empty swimming pool.

It feels like Winding-Refn was born in the wrong era, because he would've been a great midnight movie maker back in the day. In the 70s or 80s, ""Neon Demon"" would have played well alongside cult films like ""Eraserhead"" or ""Liquid Sky"". As a fringe movie, seemingly best enjoyed under the influence, it would have found its niche of freaks.

But with great stars come expectations: Fans of Fanning from ""Maleficent"" or Kershaw from her work as a Chanel model are in for a nasty surprise. The lack of exposition and bizarre plot twists will drive some people crazy, but Winding-Refn is simply imagining the vampiric nature of the fashion world as a literal coven of ghouls.

This is far from a perfect film: Refn remains an imaginative filmmaker with the ability to create powerful fusions of sound and image, but, like his pal Gaspar Noe,  he can't seem to put it to the service of anything more than soulless violence and shock. It's no coincidence that of the three films in this ""trilogy "", the strongest was ""Drive"", and it was the only of the three that wasn't written by Winding-Refn. He's teetering on the brink of greatness; here's hoping he gets there.",1503792000,28,3932,4.900751879699248

By the song at the end, the message is delivered home - that not loving yourself and allowing your jealousy to consume you is a dangerous, dangerous road. This director uses this movie to express that in the most extreme way, set in the cutthroat, sleek world of LA modeling. The social commentary is evident and comes up quick. I was very uncomfortable during some of the scenes (one in particular, you'll probably know when you come across it), but I suppose that's the intention of horror & suspense. I felt like a lot of the scenes went on longer than they needed to - long, deliberating shots of empty faces and such. It could've been an hour and a half and been more powerful. I wish I liked the main character a bit more; I always get irritated at vapid, passionless female main characters who can never make a decision or let life & other people just push them along. But it all serves the story. Beautiful women flocking to LA because their looks are the best thing they can offer the world. It has a very chilling aftereffect, but made me (oddly) commit myself to being more loving toward myself and my fellow women. I sure am going to remember the final scene every time I call myself names in my head... Or if I feel jealous of another woman's beauty or talent.

Elle Fanning is stunning in the lead role - not because of her beauty, but because of her incredibly nuanced acting as 'Jesse.'  But she is no match for Jena Malone (playing 'Ruby') - Malone dominates every scene she's in, and that's most of the film.  Jena Malone won her first acting award when she was 10 (""Bastard Out Of Carolina"") and that was 22 years ago - there is no actor in this film who can match her skills. From the very first scene, which features only Malone and Fanning, you know who the carnivore is ... and Malone pulls that off with just a twitch of her eyebrows.

I am a patient viewer (I love Jeanne Dielman), but this film is a beautifully shot, slow/medium paced film, with no substance. No substance made it difficult for me to want to give it my time, which made me impatient and bored while watching. I find it problematic that this film cast its only lesbian character as an extremely desperate, sad, sexually depraved woman. The necrophilia felt unnecessary other than somewhat as shock, but what I found to be even sadder for her character was the scene after that, when she was sitting in the tub, watching the two women shower. What I got from it was that she'd never have a partner, which is why she, Ruby, had to turn to a dead woman. Pretty much all of the characters are extremely superficial and seem to use sex solely as power plays (i.e. scumbag landlord abusing young female guests in his sleazy motel to exert power, models sleeping with industry people for work, etc.) so it felt unnecessary to include Ruby's perspective. To me, it felt pretty much only like a dig towards lesbians. Not cool, Nicolas Refn.

Besides that though, it was just really boring! The narcissistic model trope is fairly played out, and this movie didn't really add anything new to it.

My favorite part of the film is all the big cats in it! Mountain lion, etc. etc.",1494633600,2,1390,4.552

7756590,4,B01G71NN3Q,"As a work of art, this movie is worthwhile.  The visuals are stunning. It is a meditation on narcissism and the depths of insanity that follows from leading a vapid and shallow life basing your self worth on what complete strangers think of you.  On another level, it delves into the supernatural.  There are some witchcraft/ satanic rituals toward the end and many obvious allegories which point toward the devil throughout:  The lion roaming about seeking whom he may devour. Wandering in the desert. I wouldn't be surprised if the director was heavily involved in the occult, because the symbolism here abounds.  This isn't the reality of LA I live in because I choose my company more carefully than these folks, but I know that there is a definite dark side to this city...Perhaps not as dark as portrayed here, but I have no doubt many a hopeful model and actress has been devoured in one way or  another by the callousness and selfishness of many people here. Anyway, this movie is pure evil, so be on guard.

But for people who are used to such things, are likely to enjoy at least one aspect of the film. Underrated movie, but I understand why critics couldn't recommend it to a mass audience. It's violent and sexually charged. Most people would most likely be offended by the film, or turned off by it. Parents, depending on your child of course, I'd say 16 or 17 is a good age to be ok to watch. Again, depends on your kids maturity levels and how well they handle media.

I kept watching because I was led to believe by the synopsis that there was a story here about older women stealing youth.  That isn't here.  The coup de grace was a scene in which the body of a deceased female, complete with autopsy Y incision, is raped and defiled by a female makeup artist.  This is not alluded to--it is shown. I covered my eyes and nearly cried. It was at that point I gave it up and took a shower to rid myself of any residual energy this movie might have left in the air.  I'm not kidding.

Indeed, I would say it was easily the best film of 2016. For those who might be on the fence about watching it, what it is is NOT a horror movie or a traditional suspense film. Essentially, it's a retelling of All About Eve from the perspective of a modeling ingenue about to be corrupted by the machinery of commoditized beauty. In practice, it's an attempt to make the visual equivalent of a druggy European synth-pop song by mixing superficial visual movie pleasures and overt cliche in just an off-beat enough manner that (SPOILER ALERT) you aren't even slightly surprised when the movie ends with a beautiful model eagerly eating a detached eyeball. But it's not Cannibal Holocaust nor is it a funny satire - it's a weirdly self-contained world of obsessive visual fetishes, pulpy genre gestures, and strange provocations. It's a movie that's completely disposable and yet clearly the product of genuine artistic passion.

First off, this is neither a drama nor a horror film.  It's somewhere between Cronenberg-like and art-film, wishing it was a bit more David Lynch than it's ultimately capable of pulling off.  Pacing is intentionally slow, which ends up allowing for a lot of slow pans & zooms to focus on well-framed scenes.

You have to be willing to accept the one-dimensional characters, but at least in this case that IS the whole point.  I.e., you can't fault any actor's performance as flat and soulless when that's exactly what all the characters are supposed to be.

The soundtrack and art direction is consistently amazing throughout, although the many dark scenes could have used a tiny bit more accent lighting to allow viewing in anything other than the darkest of rooms and on completely glare-free screens.  Tip: DO play this on your best surround-sound rig or high-quality over-the-ear headphones; it's a delightful future-retro soundtrack.",1490140800,8,968,5.050314465408805

The music is GREAT to listen to, and Elle Fanning's character was easy to fall in love with (until you got worried she would change), but it was very confusing. This movie reminds me of the setup of The Shining. There were unnecessary parts in the movie (which any person who is good at analyzing movie would argue with me about) with the Mountain Lion, and the guy who takes the first pictures, and the landlord/motel guy. This whole movie was basically about these two women who are models/aspiring models who are jealous of this girl's quickly rising fame from her beauty. It is definitely creepy, but it would not give me ""nightmares"" (well then again, neither did the shining). I don't honestly know how I feel. I wish that it may be set up in a more normal movie setup then this weird ""think"" set up. If you don't like to think about movies, I suggest you steer clear from this one. If you loved the Shining, I would recommend this movie to you. It was also very predictable. Like how the beginning of the movie alludes to the ending. And the cannibalism is the weirdest thing. These two women seemed cool at first. I figured that the one makeup artist would end up liking her, and then get rejected, and go psycho, but I didn't expect the models too.

7756671,1,B01G71NN3Q,"Okay, so I don't know if I'm someone who ""just doesn't get it,"" but this is by far one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I will concede that the cinematography is very well done. As a matter of fact, the movie itself is very visually appealing. Unfortunately, as anyone who has had a bad relationship can tell you, looks aren't everything.
The story itself has been repeated many times, a girl goes to California to become a model, achieves it against all odds (youth, lack of skills, whatever), and loses who she is in the process. Unfortunately, the main character of Jesse has almost no character development. She meanders throughout the production with the same sleepy face and droopy eyes. There's no emotion when anything MEANT to produce an emotion happens. And the ""thriller/horror"" aspect doesn't kick in until the very end, and even then is more underwhelming than ""actual"" modern horror movies.
There's nothing scary, nothing thrilling.
This seems more like the director's experiment in shooting with a neon palette than an actual movie with a flushed out story.

First of all this is a horror movie.  Not the ""OMG scary ghost"" type though.  It's rooted more or less in reality.

Second be prepared for something different.

Third, It is very slow paced and is about style way way before substance.

What drives me to write this review is that many people have commented that they grow to dislike the main character, which was my reaction as well.  What I would add is that the main character is shaped by those around her.  She becomes pretty awful because she's surrounded by awful people.  Nobody else has any redeeming qualities with the exception of one character.

This is basically the film version of Makoto Aida's ""Harakiri School Girls."" While stylistically strong and packing scathing criticism of beauty standards (there are some not-so-subtle references to Nazi eugenics), the masochism becomes tiring. It is good to skewer popular culture with horror to shock one into viewing the material on a much more personal, visceral level. Nothing like squirming in your seat to make you think about accepted notions. However, this film is guilty of unnecessary provocation; in that it includes some really gross stuff that shows underlying misogyny instead of critique of misogyny.

7756718,4,B01G71NN3Q,"The Neon Demon is a good movie, but it's not a movie that will appeal to everyone - you'll be able to tell where you fall within the first five minutes. In fact, you can see the reviews clearly make it out to be polarizing. This is a two-hour visual and symbolic presentation, and not-too-subtle critique of the modelling life. There is an absolute ton of things to get out of this film, but it requires some effort on the part of the viewer; that's not something everyone is going to want to do.

The cinematography and audio work are top notch, and are without a doubt the biggest draws to this film. The major scenes feel like art exhibitions, where labeling them as eye candy is a bit of an understatement. Elle Fanning's performance is solid; she plays the part of an inexperienced, timid, but not altogether naive teenager embarking on her modelling career. I didn't get the impression her acting was boring or wooden, but rather what you might expect a real girl in her situation to behave like.

As far as horror goes, there are a lot of disturbing scenes, even more suggestive themes, but no jump scares if that's what you were expecting. It's  scary insofar as it gets under your skin, maybe makes you question why, but ultimately not surprise you too much if you can keep up. I'd say the final act delivered in the way I hoped, and in the way that made the most sense.

Like I said at the start, you'll quickly know if this two hour ride is for you or not. If it isn't, I wouldn't stress about forcing yourself through it, because this movie isn't going to do anything for you if you can't get into it.",1486598400,4,1613,4.384615384615385

7756720,5,B01G71NN3Q,"I feel this to be an underrated film. I don't necessarily believe it was created to be entertaining like a normal drama/thriller, but rather it's meant to be a superficial statement, more akin to an art house film. Like they say about winning in sports, ""Beauty isn't everything. It's the only thing.""

Maybe it's because I watched a few of NWR's interviews on the film, but I'm understanding of why this film is the way it is, which is almost supposed to be the opposite of his other film, Drive. While Drive was supposed to represent masculinity with its nameless, senselessly violent, straight-forward protagonist, The Neon Demon was meant to represent femininity with its soft, beautiful and deceitful protagonist. It's meant to be NWR's interpretation of the female gender and the constant struggle of how to represent oneself and how to take pride in a quality one naturally possess.

There's a lot more to this film, but it's better to experience it than read about it, so give it a chance and try not to take it for more than it was meant to be.",1486425600,5,1053,4.686486486486486

The last thirty minutes broke with the rest of the film and really never completed its thought.

What I love about this film was that the scariest thing (minor spoiler) was just existing as a young woman in the fashion industry. That concept and delivery of that theme were great.

What I hated about this film was how it felt like three or four ideas that were on a double date but no one told them who they were there on the date with. I feel like it could have used another twenty minutes to wrap its head around itself.

Anyone who says it is a cinematic masterpiece full of subtle this and aspiring that is full of it and is just regurgitating what some wannabe hipster touted in the local coffee shop to sound suave. This movie, which for some unknown reason gets put into the horror genre, is beyond boring and dull and is so full of itself that it's pathetic. The so called ""hidden symbolism"" in this movie is so easy to spot a blind and deaf two year old could get it while asleep. Nothing was clever about it in any way.

I watched this movie waiting the entire time for something unique to happen, something attention grabbing to leap onto the screen and make me find some interest in it, but alas it never came. Toward the end there was a brief glimpse of perhaps something entertaining, or that something exciting may just happen, and it was over before you could blink.

Do not waste your time with this movie unless you want to see a few pretty girls walk around to really trashy, annoying techno music and show about as much lackluster emotion and acting ability as Kristen Stewart, who by the has as much acting talent as a wet paper bag in a storm drain. I kid you not, the whole movie is nothing more than lights flashing on a girls face with crappy music playing, then someone dies and it's over.

7756740,5,B01G71NN3Q,"The movie is about the vampirical consumption of youth that the fashion industry has. It's a twisted movie, with intentionally empty scenes and characters. The lead, Elle Fanning is great. Her character undergoes a transition in the middle of the movie that makes it almost like there are two characters. She is the ideal of beauty; an ideal that the movie proves does not exist. The only real characters in the movie are Gigi and Sarah.
This movie is an art project. It is almost entirely metaphorical. The cinematography is great, but the standout is the way the movie is colored. It's awesome just to look at, with stark contrasts, Red vs. Blue. Visuals alone make it worth watching: they are the center of this movie, not the plot.
This movie and La La Land are my two favorites for this year. Interestingly, they are both about LA, and breaking into the industry, and achieving unachievable greatness. But if La La Land shows the good in LA, then Neon Demon shows they bad. It's like the two sides of a coin- the movies are polar opposites, yet center around several of the same things.

It didn't seem to be tied specifically to exactly one situation that could only exist under the circumstances of the film. The acting was pretty good on the part of Fanning and Malone; otherwise things were very stripped down and it all moved too slow for me. About fifteen minutes from the end, the horror began in earnest. It lasted about 5 minutes. About 10 minutes from the end, ROKU dropped my signal. When I tried to resume, the whole movie rebooted.

7756781,3,B01G71NN3Q,"Visually, this movie is breathtaking, although often the scenes were pretty muted and bland. This may be done intentionally for the character who's in the shots at the time...

Not much of an actual plot, if anything just to set you up for the last 10 minutes of the film. The acting is kay, unsurprisingly best performed by Malone, Reeve, and Hendricks. Manning had so much crap dialogue and zero motivation, she felt like she was literally a vehicle to move the plot...which didn't really exist!

There's so much potential in each character to have some depth, but virtually none of it was explored in this 2 hour chore of a movie. It took me all day to get through the film because I was often totally underwhelmed. For the first half of the movie, I felt as if tension was what each scene was meant to convey...but that left little dynamic to the lack-of-story-that-could-have-been-there-but-sadly-wasn't.

And pretty much every ""reveal"" could be seen a mile away. Maybe that's not the intent of the movie, and it's just there to show off the visuals (again, it was stunning). And perhaps it's even trying multiple layers of metaphors, like how the movie is beautiful, but underneath it's soulless, like socially perceived notions of models: the characters of the film.

It lacked the little bit of exposition that it needed on occasion for the story to make sense and the portrayal of models was blown slightly out of proportion. Having said that, the imagery would feel less surreal and avant-garde which I believe is what the director intended for and it shows a very real, cutthroat industry where girls break under pressure or they lose everything they have to achieve what they want. They lose friends and gain new ones with anterior motives, they lie about their age, they go in and get their entire body resculpted.

Filled with bizarre characters, enigmatic imagery and near dream like sequences it is truly a work of artistic cinema, with a rather grim look at the darker side of the fashion industry and modeling in particular.

The plot on the surface is seemingly straightforward. Young teenager Jesse, (played by Elle Fanning) is new to the City of Angels, and by her own admission, has nothing really going for her except her looks. She is an instant hit with a modeling agency, which propels her into the height of the fashion world. Jesse is enigmatic, naturally beautiful and has an odd effect on everyone she meets. Which leads to resentment and jealousy among her peers, and leads us on a bizarre odyssey that leads to a shocking conclusion.

The director really implored the use of contrasting shadows/light, vivid cinematography, and rather eerie undertones to set the mood for this dark piece. It is definitely not going to be a film for everyone. When I viewed the last scene, I was not sure if I even liked it or not. But it stayed in my mind for days on end afterward, and I ended up viewing it again. Well worth the watch for me.",1484524800,5,1216,4.5227272727272725

7756911,3,B01G71NN3Q,"I don't quite understand why so many people seem to hate this movie. It's not as good as ""Drive"" (the only other Nicolas Winding Refn movie I've seen), but it definitely has its merits. First of all, it's impeccably made, especially in terms of the visuals. If you're at all familiar with Refn's films, this won't surprise you. There is also some very good acting in the movie. I thought Jena Malone's character, Ruby, was the most interesting, and I also thought she turned in the most impressive performance in the film. I only wish they had explored that character more. (Seriously, she kind of stole the film.) Elle Fanning as Jesse was also very good. She fit the character really well. Keanu Reeves, as usual, can't really act. Not sure why he keeps getting jobs. But he wasn't horrible, either. There are some aspects of ""The Neon Demon"" that felt a little thin, though. The evolution of Jesse could be described as a little rushed, for instance, although I did enjoy the way in which Refn portrayed that evolution. Overall, I thought the use of visual storytelling in this movie was very effective. There is some great imagery here. And none of it was really that vague or pretentious. I think this film could definitely benefit from multiple viewings, if you're so inclined. There were a couple of points where I felt like nothing was really happening, and I began to get a little bored, but those parts only lasted a couple of minutes. Overall, good film, though I can understand why some people say it was a bit ""shallow"" or lacking in substance. There's not much dialogue; you could almost say it's the exact opposite of a Quentin Tarantino film in that way. But as I said to my brother while we were watching, you certainly can't accuse Nicolas Winding Refn of not adhering to the maxim of ""show, don't tell""!

There is no point, no revelation, no insight but the sophomoric idea that a models vanity would lead her to commit terrible acts or become something horrific beneath all that stunning physical beauty.

I have to say I was drawn to this film because of Elle Fanning, and was quite unsure what the movie was about other than knowing is was horror/suspense. The Neon Demon left me speechless. A young beautiful girl that everyone else is jealous of. The Neon Demon is colorful, beautiful, visually phenomenal. Giving me much of a techno vibe with some of the music and flashing neon lights, it leaves you wondering what is going on. The Neon Demon takes quite some time to build, and the main plot does not happen until towards the very end. But man, when everything hits the fan, it really hits. The gruesome violent effects that you witness are pretty demented. But it really shows off the psychotic individuality of the other girls. All in all this movie was fantastic. If you can enjoy a movie with a very slow build up leaving you wondering what is going to happen the entire time, with beautiful coloring and lighting and gives you the ending you probably didn't expect, then I highly recommend this.",1483920000,,1061,4.560209424083769

The pros: This film is visually lovely to watch and seeing Keanu was neat, BUT that about sums it up for pros.

Cons: The film had the makings of something interesting but over halfway through the director decided he really wanted to make a poorly done gore film, yes GORE. Think leggy homicidal blondes running around scantily clad, this film had the makings of something intriguing but it crescendos into a bad joke that ends in poor taste and that isn't even the worst part. To quote the MPAA  rating label there is,""a scene of aberrant sexuality"", and trust me its very aberrant and completely ludicrous.

Those who attempt to say this film is masquerading as some hidden message about the fashion world and models, like a bad piece of abstract art, they are putting way too much into a poor piece of work, trying to make it sound better than it is. THIS FILM WAS NOT GOOD WORK.

 I suggest the director stick to either music videos or as Michael Bay's assistant because his only success with this pile of a film was making people pretty on screen.",1483920000,,1317,4.582978723404255

Visually, in terms of composition, cinematography, makeup, etc, this movie delivered as all of Refn's movies do. The movie started out promising and I thought the rest of the movie would creatively explore innocence, jealousy, and power through the context of LA's modeling world. I knew enough about Refn to NOT expect a robust, continuous plot line, which Neon Demon did not have as expected. However, the story was endlessly meandering, a downward spiral of shock jocking and corny dialogue. The dialogue and screenplay were contrived; they movie thought it was deeper than it was. The last hour of the movie devolves into unnecessary and incoherent violence, sexual violence, lesbian encounters, and various permutations of those three things. I get that a Refn movies are violent, but the violence in Neon Demon was corny and bizarre.

I guess if you like Refn, you should watch and judge for yourself. Maybe if you're in the entertainment/modeling world it might resonate better with you? But I think most will be disappointed.",1483747200,2,1124,5.108695652173913

""I'll take your beauty with the quick twist of the wrist and you'll die for getting in my space"" as practiced by almost left-behind, not quite there clothing models of LA. You've seen them, there's a sea of new pretty-pretty girls pouring onto the lovely California beaches with every tide.

Spoiler tag!

New pretty girl #1 freshly out of the spaces of an opportunistic countryside slides into a flea-bag bedbug infested Pasadena motel then instantly gets ""discovered"" by a less-than-ravaging lesbian makeup artisan (previously seen in the hunger-games-ian movies) who coincidentally, moonlights days as a cadaver maker up-er artisan. Freaky, ikr?  She pitches new pretty girl #1 to the gnarly hands of the Holidaywood vampire photo-shooters. NPG  #1 rises to insignificant position fast and so high that she finds herself standing right in the lime green jelly bowl the lesbo-band eats their one calorie a day from. So, lesbo witch leader and her merry band of stuck-up lesbo-buddies, sadistically murder NPG #1 (I should claim rights to NPG!!) just minutes before NPG #2 arrives on the scene.

Wowzer. Dude what more can you ask for on a fine winter Saturday morning?

This NPG (#2) is a character who immediately needs dosing with a self-administered murdering in the form of a poisoned eyeball XXX (stands for poison eyeballs) which she pukes up just before her death. You can just feel tension rising, rising, rising, building to a ignitable ginormous crescendo (no you can't) - then she dies.

Dang. No more NPG's. Roll Credits.

THOSE CREDITS. The letterset and the stability attained through digital compositing are mind boggling! Yiiis!  These best of breed no-wiggle letters are the stuff and IMO are apically perfect for a motion picture! These pretty girls, na, not so much, but their danger overrides whatever appearance shortcomings they might have. That's just the way things are when you're dealing with pretty girls. All bets in on this movie, I might have opted to spend five grand more on a script and five grand less on weak-assed antiseptic, blas, Russian synth-popper music.

I always rate NPG movies 5 stars when they feature pretty girls doing pretty girl stuff. I consider murdering one another off during the course of a 90 minute plus movie a bit on the girly side. This wasn't a Jean Clod Van-Damn deal, but wait, it's every bit as exciting as one. You should get yourself a big ol' bar of silly-food and sit down and watch Neon Demon right now.

Starts off very slow but immerses you into a world or modeling not yet exposed by the film industry which deeply affected the films reviews.
The film is also not for the faint stomached. It can be viewed as over the top.
But that's Refn style. Starts off slow. And then he hits you across the head with something that will for sure leave you saying WHAT THE F.... DID THAT JUST HAPPEN. He's raw. Visionary. And gritty as hell. The script was a little iffy but he's not much of a dialog writer (Drive, Vahalla Rising) besides that it delivers like something out of a horror movie. Jena Malone delivers one weird raw and unimaginable performance. And Elle Fanning...well this girl is special. Refn always gets the best out of actors. Kenau Reeves delivers a haunting performance which makes you beg him to stop but also make you want so much more.

Someone told me I was being too critical of this film since it's called a 'Satore"" >>> or satire...or something, but whatever, WHO CARES!!!

I wanted to see a good movie here like 'The Devil Wears Prada' or ""13 Going on 30"", but no, this movie is this stupidly stylish ""satoire"" or something that wanted me to think about its ""metacommentary"" or something on the ""consumption of beauty"". I was like WTF? I'm not here to think about this s***! I came for hot models and a not so creepy Keanu Reeves!

Why do movies have to overcomplicate things? It's easy to make a good movie by following a basic formula. This movie tries to change it up or be innovative, but I won't give it credit for trying something new and emulating the feel of some douchebag like Dario Argento. I just wont.

Plus, there's like no talking in this film so you never get where the plot is going. The movie thinks its all fancy-shmancy by using colors, lighting, symbols, and character development to tell the story, but shoot, can anyone at least tell me what the heck is going on? I'd prefer if this movie had some opening voice over talking about what it means to be a model and be really hot and stuff, that would have been awesome.

But no, instead you get this dumb wannabe David Lynch movie that acts like it's above my head. Well I say NO! I am pretty smart anyway, I saw 'Memento' and almost got the movie after the fifth time. I won't even bother with this movie...instead, go watch 'Ghostbusters' the 2016 remake.

From the get go, the visuals: supposedly the best part of the movie, and they are about ok at times. Not only they don't convey too much meaning, which you would imagine the creators probably don't feel like they have to, but they barely convey an emotion at times.

Either nothing happens, or some cringe worthy script / dialog / acting makes me think something might happen but then again it doesn't.
Torture-porn and weird sex will also makes you cringe, still failing to actually be provocative.

I can see influences of Lynch and Kubrick here and there (or at least trying to be), the cinematography and general themes presented in the movie were interesting to me but like what one character said ""you can always tell when beauty is manufactured"" there was no real solid idea underneath other than purely visual. My interpretation was that the filmmaker was trying to express that the fashion industry is very eye catching, cutthroat, pointless and shallow by making a movie equally so he has succeeded. My main issue is after all that build up there was really nothing at the end leaving so many plot holes and audiences scratching their heads if that was part of his intent 'How pretentious'.",1482624000,4,797,4.741007194244604

7757132,5,B01G71NN3Q,"I try to rarely pull the ""you need to be a film buff"" card when I review a movie, but this is definitely the case for Neon Demon. Most people who turn on this movie see a model on the cover and expect sex and excitement, it needs to be a popcorn movie to appeal to mass audiences- and it isn't. Neon Demon is a solid art-house outing from a director who's taking chances and trying to execute something you don't see every day at the theater. The reaction here is sadly what you'd expect from a moviegoing populace who aren't used to seeing directors take risks anymore- people don't ""get it"" and that makes them mad. I'm happy to say I didn't get parts of this movie, and I'm all the more glad that the director had the guts to make it! We need more great, thought-provoking cinema like this.

So what's here? Neon Demon is a sparse narrative, basically a simple story of a young girl who gets eaten up by the fashion industry. There's nothing earth-shaking about that plot. The interest is in how the story is told. The visual and music are absolutely stunning- there are shots and musical numbers in this film that will absolutely take your breath away. My theater was using the soundtrack for their theater music for weeks. Dialog and scenes are sparse, often having very few actors onscreen and with not a lot of dialog between them. Director Nicholas Winding Refn (who uses his NWR moniker liberally in the credits) is trying to portray the wasteland of the fashion industry very literally onscreen. And it works. Christina Hendricks and Keanu Reeves turn up in surprisingly small and well-placed cameos. Elle Fanning is absolutely perfect as the model. The casting was flat-out amazing.

I saw this movie in a theater and several people were unhappy or walked out. But what's interesting, is that the movie absolutely worked for those people until they gave up and left. There are some scenes where the dialog will be very flat, and then all of a sudden one tiny little facial expression or play on words will shift the scene and the whole audience was laughing out loud or turning in revulsion at the screen. That's the power of this movie- it's all about the real tricks of the movie trade, using the pieces of the film to give the viewer a strong emotional experience. It really does just feel like too many moviegoers are lazy and don't want to expend the brainpower to get into a film like this.

Here's an example. In many modern movies, there's a thing called ""Shot, Reverse Shot"". Basically when two people are talking, most directors just shoot over each person's shoulder. So you're looking at A as he talks, and then B as she talks, A B A B A B scene ends. Then people C and D are talking. CDCDCD. And then B enters. CDBCD... you get the idea. For someone who's really paying attention to the movie, this is boring and flat no matter what the people are talking about. NWR doesn't pull that, he's using interesting framing choices and experimenting with new ways of conveying ideas onscreen. If a character feels alone, they'll be shown in a long shot by themselves against an empty backdrop- you feel that they're alone without being told. For the interested moviegoer, it's a visual feast. You're stretching your observation muscles in a way you haven't in so many other movies lately. You need to pick up the details from the expressions on people's faces, the way they're framed in a shot, and how they're used in a scene- rather than just what they're saying. It's beautiful. I want to draw comparisons to the current renaissance in Korean filmmaking, such as Park Chan-wook's ""The Handmaiden"", another interesting masterpiece full of good directing.

But it does take an ""informed"" moviegoer to pull it all in, and even then I'm not sure it's a great movie as much as it's a solid visual experience that film buffs absolutely need to see if they want a little restored faith that real movies are still being made in today's industry. The fact that this little bit of art-house sleaze got a wide release is absolutely lovely, and all the better for Amazon helping make it happen. This movie is the kind of thing Quentin Tarantino makes when he tries to do something a little more grindhouse- cool sleaze.

If people were looking for NWR to make another ""Drive"", the only way these movies compare is that they have great visuals, a killer soundtrack, and masterful directing. Drive was a more popcorn, affair in people's minds, the movie at least had cars even if car chases were actually a tiny fraction of the movie. Neon Demon doesn't have car chases, and what it does have is much darker and more surreal.

I love Neon Demon. I love it because it's cool, it's pretentious, and sometimes it stumbles. Warts and all I accept the movie for what it is, and I'm sure I could make a lame comparison to the fashion industry to tie that together but that would be telling rather than showing. Even if this movie doesn't ""do it"" for all viewers, you have to respect that it was made and that it took the risks it did. I want some of the stills from this movie framed in my home, and I already bought the soundtrack months go. If you care about film, see this movie. If you just want a porcorn action flick for your Netflix binge, stay away.",1482364800,,5257,4.5517970401691334

It's certainly on purpose, and while that is admirable (Refn has gone so far as to refer to his own films as porn), I could never escape the drag of Refn's brushstrokes, which nestled my suspension of disbelief into an uncanny-valley like place. Jesse is the new girl in town, basically homeless, and ready to make a splash in the cut-throat LA modeling world. Despite what you may have heard there is an overarching narrative and it seems to follow Jesse's vaulted rise through said industry, leaving some ""long-time"" veterans jealously in her wake. It may sound like I didn't like the film, and that's not entirely true, I didn't necessarily ""enjoy"" the film, but I did appreciate parts of it, and will watch it again, if only to take in some of the more lavish, and hauntingly beautiful cinematography. Jesse's neonlaced, ""big-show"" scene stands out in particular. The last act was sadly spoiled for me to a degree, although I wasn't quite prepared for just how depraved, and viseral the film would eventually go, even with a decent familiarity of Refn's past work.

Despite himself, Nicolas Winding Refn (whose Ryan Gossling vehicle Drive is adored, pun intended) has created a highly stylized film equal parts disturbing, repulsive, captivating, and critical. I say 'despite' because this film only exists as quality if we ignore intention. The Neon Demon's narrative is one that moves from misogyny (first two thirds) to gynephobia (it's stunning final third). This movie isn't about vanity; looking is what this film is about, the male gaze certainly but moreover the corruption of objectification and how it makes us all guilty.",1481155200,,616,5.295918367346939

That being said I really found this film terrible, what stood out as the worst feature of the film is that there is about zero character development. All of the characters in the film are just paper thin caricatures of what seems to be the worst features of the fashion industry. I do understand the points that the film was making, I understand the messed up nature of the fashion industry to devour the youthful, and at the same time making everyone else desire the youthful through ads and fashion shows. I get that was the overall message of the film. The pacing of the movie was horrible it was way too slow and tries to shove symbolism down your throat. There really is little explanation of the occult side to the film and it honestly feels forced when it happens. The whole time I was watching in the back of my mind I was thinking that it was referencing Suspiria, by the time the Climax hits I realized its not referencing it's almost wholesale ripping off Suspiria. That being said, just watch Suspiria. Why I rated this two stars is because it was well produced, I enjoyed the lighting and cinematography (to a point, because some shots went on for too long with no payoff) and the soundtrack was excellent.

This film is really quite fantastic. Ignore all the reviews that look strictly at what the characters do, or how they develop. What these characters are, and what role they have to play is more metaphorical in the story than anything else. The film gives you time to stop and think about what these characters are, what they represent, and what the story really is.

I like to think of this film along the same lines of a classic Kubric film. There are no flashy cuts and jumpy pacing that assumes the viewer is an A.D.D. sufferer.

7757475,1,B01G71NN3Q,I can handle a slow movie but this one was the director masturbating and being self indulgent rather than revealing anything interesting about the characters or plot. The acting is really bad (I blame the director) and the story and characters are unwatchable. I got about a third of the way through and I can watch just about anything.

It's a very slow-paced movie, but I enjoyed every second of it.  After an hour of the movie, I felt like it had been two hours, but I was happy because it meant I still had another hour left.

I almost forgot to talk about the soundtrack.  Nothing but 80's/90's synth work.  I'm a huge fan of that, so I love the soundtrack wholeheartedly.  It also complements the cinematography of the movie with it's bright, neon colors.  I'm actually listening to the soundtrack as I write this review.

There's definitely some ""material"" in this movie that others will likely be offended by.  I wasn't bothered by this material because the movie isn't grounded in reality, but is blatantly going for the abstract.  This broke my suspension of disbelief somewhat, so it didn't bother me as much.  It may bother other viewers though.

But that's about it.
It's laughably bad.

No clean-cut resolutions to the messy dramas that unfurl.

So if you can handle that, watch this movie and enjoy the brilliant satire of modern society's obsession with youth and beauty.

There were scenes that I felt had no relevance to the story. There was plenty of symbolism & art symbolism, but as casual viewer, I will never be able to appreciate them to their full extent. I wouldn't even really call it a thriller-horror except maybe for the last arc, which I felt was done more for the shock factor. The film obviously isn't aimed for the masses, so that's why the majority of people dislike it.

I really did try to analyze and like this film, and many times I thought to just turn it off since I felt the plot was moving slowly, but I pulled through with a bland taste at the end.

If you know Nicholas Winding Refn's (NWR) previous work, this is definitely a movie with his finger prints all over it. Thus you can decide if this is something you would appreciate seeing as his movies aren't generally for everyone. Personally I like his work with all of his foreshadowing, symbolism, great cinematography, and moody real-world stories (Neo-Noir). After seeing this, I feel it's appropriate to label this movie as a horror flick, as there is a constant feeling of uneasiness and the climax really making this movie fall into that category. Also it would be a crime not to talk about the cinematography and how NWR really tried to capture a story, symbolism, and the main character's ""transformation"" without using many words. Also using lighting and objects to great effect here. The characters are all well done with most being easy to figure out, and others' real intentions being much murkier.

1. Amazon liked this director's work of the past and said sure, we'll fund anything you do because you have a following.  And the director (also the writer) threw this trash together as quickly as he could with some named actors everyone would recognize.  Amazon paid him, who caes that the movie is horrible.
2. Amazon will take ANYTHING.  Throw a complete script at Amazon... congratulations you get to make a film!

I usually don't because I don't want other people's opinions to give me a preconceived notion because sometimes I like movies that other's don't.  But I think I've learned a good lesson.

7757653,3,B01G71NN3Q,"Drive (2011) was an excellent yet soul-rattling film of sociopathy-laced catharsis; an intense, sensory, noirish tale so tone-sensitive that one would hardly notice the plot.  I loved it!  Director and writer Nicolas Winding Refn (Valhalla Rising, Drive, Only God Forgives) embarks on a similarly disorienting journey when an aspiring model moves to Los Angeles only to have her youth and vitality devoured by a group of beauty-obsessed women who will take any means necessary to possess what she has.

Scintillating from the first minute, the colors are vibrant and the score enchantingsomehow feeling gorgeous yet totally artificial.  Every effort is made to test our morality while taunting our senses, as if True Blood glamoring us.  Like Charlie or Alice, at first impressed by the magical wonders of Wonderland and Willy Wonkas factory, only to eventually reveal their true nature; their dangers.

Imagine the prettiest teenage girl from a small Idaho town.  Shes probably the Potato Princess in the Cadillac for the 4th of July parade and perpetually told her beauty would take her far in life and far from this little old town.  Fresh off the bus to Los Angeles and full of youth, beauty and naivete, Jesse (Elle Fanning; Super 8, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button) is a young model succumbing to the most avant-garde artists whims.  Like a black lamb centering a snowy field, her stark innocence is readily apparent to the ever-vigil predatory denizens of the tree line preparing for the slaughter.  She is marinaded with compliments, if only to prepare her fair flesh for rending.

Some of the imagery and dialogue is coarse, with tongues sharpened.  Despite the lovely strobe-lit iridescence you cant help but to momentarily react as if a small piece of metal had struck glass.  Perhaps aiming for a brutally honest revelation behind the curtain of the Los Angeles fashion industry, we find ourselves in blunt and shallow waters where we may encounter the kindest compliment one moment, only to be followed by a scathing remark the nexthowever, both delivered with a glimmering smile as if the speaker equally found pleasure in both.  Ah, Los Angeleswhere small town girls big dreams come to dieor, more honestly put, to be crucified.

Pleasant and candid, Ruby (Jena Malone; Sucker Punch, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire & The Mockingjay) seems to actually care for Jesses well-beingbut her intentions will be tested as the viewer comes to suspect everyone of foul play.  Rounding out the cast, Abbey Lee (Mad Max: Fury Road, Gods of Egypt) and Bella Heathcote (Dark Shadows, Pride and Prejudice and Zombies) play immensely shallow models, Christina Hendricks (Drive, Mad Men) has a brief but wonderful role at the modeling agency, Jesses landlord is strangely played by Keanu Reeves (John Wick, 47 Ronin, Man of Tai Chi), and Desmond Harrington (Wrong Turn, Dexter) is an enigmatic photographer who is ghoulishly gaunt and enthralled in his own art.

A great many themes run amok in the third act.  Among such concepts are voyeurism, homicidally erotic shower scenes, bloody nudity, murderous models, strangely urinating in the moonlight, macabre vomit, gory self-mutilation, suicide, consuming thy enemy, and a diversity of severe mental illness.

This film observes Jesses rapid social degeneration, and her downward spiral finds peril in others jealousy and attraction to her.  The treacherous journey endures forced sexual advances, necrophilia, fixations leading to murderous behavior, a brutal fall from grace, and a blood of virgins finale.
This film may not paint the modeling industry in a positive light, but it is serenely shot with a fleeting sense of reality.  Like a model, many of the shots are perfect and beautiful.  But like the industry, the waters are shallow yet dangerous.

Intense, beautiful, artificial, dangerousand ultimately BRUTAL.  Difficult to explainbut even as a fan of brutal films, Id say I appreciated this movie a lot more than I enjoyed it.  Highly recommended for fans of brutal, nourish films like Drive (2011).",1479686400,,4065,5.1694656488549615

While visuals are important to a film the story is the foundation of the whole thing. I also don't understand why this is under the horror category because it is not even scary just disgusting. The whole necrophilia and cannibalism isn't really scary just gross (especially for the detail and how long the scenes were). Just do yourself a favor and watch something else.

7757714,5,B01G71NN3Q,"I believe the reviewers below are missing something here. This is a wonderful film and I'll tell you why, but first, a question: Why the 'cliches?'
One could argue that this film falls upon many cliches of this industry. The things that you as the viewer think you know about the industry, are all here upon display. In reality, you as the viewer have not the slightest clue what goes on behind the curtain at Celine, Versace, or any other fashion house. I could approach this review from many angles but instead I will simply view it as an allegory.. Within the circle of girls. Any group of girls take a look at them. There is no definitive group and that is why these girls are different. However, one thing is the same and be it physical or not, there is a certain pecking order within that group where the most sought for is the most hated by her 'friends.'
Many women will risk their life for their own reputation (Tiziana Cantone) and this view of the fashion industry embodies that. The girls were willing to kill Fanning because she was the center of that world. Women thrive off attention and this was a hit on the head. Because in a 'normal' group of girls, they'd be more than willing to sacrifice one of their friends by destroying her reputation/marriage/relationships/career/etc.
The disposable male utility is viewed with the good guy (who I thought would be a rapist in the beginning but I digress) as being shunned by the girl with no prospects once she does receive those prospects. The necessity for Fanning to have a friend becomes increasingly apparent but the only one who was, she shunned. A woman can only depend on a man as opposed to a woman or herself, this is the reason why from the designer, to the photographer, to the friend, she received that support.
Sarah (So hot she should be made illegal) embodies the mean girl to the core. Toward the end with the rejection of the flesh of Fanning, Sarah takes it in because: ""What's it feel like to walk into a room and it's like the middle of the winter and you're the sun?""
""It's everything.""
Like Drake Said: ""Jealousy is like love and hate at the same time.""
So Sarah wins. She is, for the duration of these fleeting moments that she has made her life. Until the time in which she is no longer so desired, she is that Sun. Or shall I say, she is that Demon dancing to house music in Jimmy Choo Anouk, in a two story loft in Ribadeo beneath the neon glisten upon her skin. Until the Sun rises and overtakes her within the euphoric shift of power to the new sun (Fanning) and she basks in that like the dying of an intergalactic star.",1479513600,,2611,4.441666666666666

7757721,1,B01G71NN3Q,"Yikes this film is dreadful.  I can't believe I read such positive reviews for this or that it won an award.  Others have praised it for its visual imagery.  Yawn.  It's a copy of so many other films out there (Peter Greenaway, even The Human Centipede, goodness there's something to strive for) but from the first image it looked dated - weird for a film about fashion released this year.  Why do all modelling films look like they were made in the 1980s?  WAYYYYY overexcessive use of slow motion.  The film is like watching several hours of emoticons, passing slowly before you on a screen.  I don't believe the imdb trivia piece that passed up saying that Elle Fanning joined this after Carey Mulligan dropped out, unless they mean that Carey Mulligan was attached to this before she'd even done the Doctor Who episode - she doesn't need to attach herself to this sort of tripe.  But there's no way that Elle Fanning would be this interesting to the fashion industry, and I think that's what annoys me the most, because all these scenes where everyone stops dead and for them no one else even exists in the room anymore isn't backed up by what the screen is showing us, and that's just mean on Elle Fanning, who is clearly a lovely looking girl with what on any average girl would be a great figure - but it's not enough for the fashion industry - by fashion standards she is fat.  And it hurts me to write that about someone who clearly isn't fat - but pretending that she's a revolutionary astounding new model that no one can wait to sign or book is just rubbish.  It means that every scene (and so many of them in slow motion) reveal that her legs are too short, her hips are too wide, her waist is not model thin, her nose looks weirdly abridged like a bad nose job and all that the film actually achieves is that I, like the other models, can't understand her sudden fame.  Then out of nowhere she acquires confidence like a fiend.  Uh - okay.  Don't find that believable either.  So there's another sad factor which is the inevitable comparison to how her sister would act the hell out of the scenes, and she isn't.  Another imdb trivia piece popped up that the director's wife is in the restaurant scene, and that this is one of the few of his movies that she likes. Ah.  Well that's nice.  Because I don't even like this one.  Fortunately I'm not married to hiim.  Now the person in the movie with actual ""it"" factor is Keanu Reeves.  Doesn't always do a brilliant acting job, but it's hard to take your eyes off him when he's onscreen.  Take this as a lesson, bad movie directors.  And you, too, Amazon.  This won an award?  Was it the only entrant?

Edited because I learned from another review why the main character suddenly got confidence.  It was a pretty silly reason.  Also learned from imdb why I couldn't figure out why Ruby talked about her lipstick in an earlier scene as ""Redrum"" (an obvious Stephen King/classic Kubrick film reference) then went on to say that lipstick sells better if its name is related to food or sex.  Turns out it's because the lipstick was ""Red rum"" not ""redrum"".  That would have helped if Ruby/Jena Malone had actually separated the two words.  (Because rum equals food is as meaningful as anything else in this stupid film.)  While I think this film would be terrible if it was about a young girl showing up in Hollywood, Elle Fanning would have been more believable as a young girl arriving in town hoping to become an actress, because while actresses are still held to ridiculously skinny proportions as the ideal, her height and body shape would have been completely believable.  As a model, she'd be told to lose at least 10 pounds (honestly - probably quite a lot more) and come back to the agency first.  Still a bad film though.",1479427200,,3788,4.489766081871345

What it does show is that modelling is more competitive than I imagined, in this State anyway.

7757739,3,B01G71NN3Q,"First off this movie seemed to be set in the future with the music and the lighting alone although California looked like it should've either way this was never specified one way or the other.  As far as movies go this was visually stunning and weird but you could not look away from it for one second. Elle Fanning is a small town girl who hopes to make it in the big state of California as a model because her dim bulb boyfriend told her she could be. She basically lives in a rundown motel owned by a warped Keanu Reeves who is a bully and as crooked as they come. She gets a modeling job and almost instantly she is greeted by a strange makeup artist Ruby who instantly tries to warm up to young Jesse. She then starts to gain notice for her natural looks and her naivety as she lands a showing with a major designer much to the chagrin of models Sarah and Gigi.

As the movie goes on you see how the two models react to being fed scraps as the young Jesse is the new face and they are passed over, and you also see the transformation of Ruby as she is def not what she seems.

This movie was so different as I said above visually and musically than anything I have ever seen.  You really do not know what it coming next and that is what was captivating about the film.

7757741,2,B01G71NN3Q,"I watched this somewhere else so that's why I didn't purchase it here or whatever. Take that as you want to.

I really like Nicholas Winding Refn. I think he tries things that are daring, and get's performances out of people that tends to work within the context of his films. The cinematography, and style, in several of his films is amazing, and overall I think he is generally a very promising director.

He has to stop doing this, though. It's fine if he just wants to be an ""artsy"" director and make surreal movies. We get it. He loves Stanley Kubrick films. Most specifically, it seems, he really loved '2001 a space odyssey' because his last two films ('Only God Forgives' and this) have been as incomprehensible as that film (this is not me mocking 2001- Kubrick admitted himself it was not a film you are supposed to understand). We get it Nicholas. You really liked that movie. Move on already. It's not an interesting film experience (artsy or otherwise), and you're not referencing it well.

I saw the documentary his wife did about him making 'Only God Forgives' so I was willing to give him some slack with that movie because it seemed like the pressure of having a more popular film made it difficult for him to figure out what he wanted to do going forward. I don't personally understand this because he made an even more amazing film before 'Drive' called 'Bronson' which everyone should see. It's incredible. Ever since finishing 'Drive', though, now he's just making these surrealist, incomprehensible, art films that are really hard to sit through because so little happens.

Kubrick did something different with all his films. That's why he is so lauded (even though I don't agree he's a great director it cannot be denied that he pioneered so many amazing styles of film making). He didn't keep doing the same thing over and over. I don't understand why Nicholas Winding Refn decided to go for this same style again if that's his muse.

I was hoping this would be more like 'Black Swan' at least (a psychological thriller), but it meanders so long on nothing (just like 'Only God Forgives' as well as the films he is referencing that are actually better films) that it becomes incredibly difficult to sit through. It was untenable in this film and I had to stop watching. I've never done that, but there was just too much focus on the art of his cinematography which is less impressive in this than it was in 'Only God Forgives' (which, honestly, the cinematography and style of that movie is the only reason I could get through it).

This is really disappointing to me. It seems like he really wants to skip dialogue (which was incredible in 'Bronson') and just make films where he holds static shots on things he thinks look cool for 2 to 5 minutes at a time for 2 hours. It's rough to sit through, and I don't know how much longer I can give him the benefit of the doubt.

I lost it with this one. I just couldn't get to the end. It's too much. Too boring.

I will say all the performances (when they're not being stifled by Nicholas Winding Refn wanting this to be another homage to Stanley Kubrick) are fantastic in the film. What really brings it down is the incessant shots of nothing happening over long courses of time with very uninteresting artsy designs that aren't particularly new or inspired like his previous films. In this one he's basically got nothing to hold on to beyond good actors giving their best performances, and it's a real bummer because their dialogue and pacing is terrible.

Just skip this one. It's a complete waste of time. I feel terrible I have to say that.",1479340800,,3615,4.5922480620155035

The lighting was AWFUL WAY TOO MANY TIMES. I couldn't see what was happening for a good portion of the film.

The story was weak and messy: what happened to the manager--what was his deal? What about the boyfriend? What about Ruby? Were these girls cannibals, vampires, or what? It would have been an interesting commentary on the modeling industry, but I still HAVE NO IDEA what those girls were supposed to be.

7757832,3,B01G71NN3Q,"Directed By:

Nicolas Winding Refn

Written By:

Nicolas Winding Refn

Starring:

Elle Fanning, Jena Malone, Abbey Lee

Synopsis:

When aspiring model Jesse moves to Los Angeles, her youth and vitality are devoured by a group of beauty-obsessed women who will use any means necessary to get what she has in this horror thriller from Nicolas Winding Refn.

The Skinny:

Ill get right to the point: Refns erotic thriller (And it is a thriller. Yes, there are horror elements, but they're fleeting), The Neon Demon is his weakest film in an otherwise impressive filmography. Now, with that being said, Refns worst is still 90% better than just about everything being released into theaters.

The Neon Demon is deeply atmospheric (Perhaps too much so?), and like the much maligned, Only God Forgives (Which I consider to be one of Refns best films), it is a love letter to David Lynch and his films such as Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive.

As with all Refn films, The Neon Demon is visually stunning and is like a living, breathing surrealist masterpiece. The problem is that most of the characters are just as two dimensional. Theres no meat to their actions, all style and no substance. But maybe this is the effect that Refn was going for? Young women obsessed with only two things: Beauty and how to make money from that beauty.

I cant say I would recommend The Neon Demon to the casual viewer (Just move along, casual viewer, go find some super hero movie to occupy your time with.), but if you're a fan of Refns films or enjoy subtlety crafted horror thrillers, itll be right up your alley.",1479254400,,1596,4.722021660649819

There was something about t that almost made me feel like I was reminiscing when I was watching certain scenes while the soundtrack played in the background. But then, it just got plain weird. I do not even know how to describe this movie other than you will probably love it or hate it, the latter seemingly being the most popular response. I may try to finish this film later, but I just could not stomach the latter half.

NWR is one of those filmmakers that has his own vision, and usually and wonderfully he translates that vision onto film, along with his talented film-making staff.

That being said, I was in total awe of ""The Neon Demon"" and it's presentation, stunning and engrossing.  Soundtrack, cinematography, editing, acting, script was all cohesive and strengthened all other aspects of the film.  Loved it.  The first 70 minutes, that is.  The last 35 minutes just did not fire on all cylinders for me...it felt forced and uneven.

Perhaps I was not perceptive enough to catch subtle nuances, I am by no means the know-all perfect cinema aficionado, but I do know what I like in a good movie (see first sentence) and I did not get that ""fully entertained"" feeling after watching all of ""The Neon Demon""

I'm not giving up on ""The Neon Demon""; I plan to re-watch this movie several more times, maybe I just was not ""ready"" to see it when I did.  Perhaps my mind was not open enough to grasp NWR's narrative in those last 35 minutes.  I have hope...",1479168000,,1237,4.765258215962441

7757876,2,B01G71NN3Q,"If you follow Vigilant Citizen so much of this movie follows what is laid out time after time after time on the website.  First of all, the basics:
Main character; she goes from innocent (wearing mostly white/whiteish) to being inducted into the dark (black at the fashion show) to ending with red and being sacrificed.  This is a common trend in ""pop"" or even ""high"" art.

Next, we have the pyramid symbolism.  She is having flashes of the pyramid, in red in blue, and in reflection (which was very ""Under the Skin"" esque).  This is one of the pure symbols that are everywhere if you keep an ""eye"" out.

Eye, lots of one-eyed shots.  This is, yet, another symbol.

Lastly, as far as the obvious symbols, is the eating of the young/innocent/drinking of and bathing in blood:  this is what ""keeps"" the old, young.  Or, so they believe.  This is what they think, and hell, it might be true, but I will not step to that sickness.

As far plot, it appears to be commentary on the modeling industry and also the idea of vanity.  I don't know if it's saying the two are hand-in-hand or if the modeling industry makes you vain.  I am leaning on the latter.
It is also a comment on the exploitation of young girls.  That seems obvious, so I don't even feel special for writing that line.  However, it's a review.  I'll mention my points.

Final point:  Good gosh.  Waaaaayyyyyy slow.  I think if you boiled down the dialogue, it would fit on a single page.  That only works for very few movies.  If it weren't for the soundtrack it would practically be a silent movie.  That wasn't much fun to watch and wasn't a breakthrough on originality.",1479168000,3,1633,4.476190476190476

It takes a very small amount of content and drags it out over one hour and 45 minutes.  Some of the scenes are very sick and very disturbing in every possible way.  There are some lines that should never be crossed and this film manages to cross all of those lines - whoever wrote this movie is a very sick person who needs professional help.  It just doesn't tell you who these people are or why they are doing what they are doing -  It is a movie that is very difficult to watch.  I watched the entire movie, but it was very sickening.

7757912,3,B01G71NN3Q,"Par for the course as with most Refn movies, I'll be it, one of the weaker entries but still enjoyable.  A visually surreal landscape, stunning use of color and minimalist story.  The movie sets an uneasy tone from start to finish and keeps pushing the viewer towards a grizzly end.

The movie stars Fanning as an underage girl, freshly transplanted into LA's modeling scene.  Trying to land her first big gig and hopefully become the 'IT' girl she always known she could be.  She quickly catches the eye of certain powers, progressing ever closer to stardom.  But it is soon evident that their is a heavy cost to it all.  Surrounded by predators (both physically and literally) she'll need to learn how to navigate her own vanity and whom to put her trust into, as she walks ever deeper into the dark side of fame.

The story isn't anything we haven't seen a million times before, at this point we should be aware of the nature of such professions and how quickly they eat their own.  What this movie does do well is tell a visually striking tale that slow burns into a gory, horror film.",1479168000,,1089,4.51530612244898

It had very little story to go off of and most of the scenes are just downright boring and bizarre. Now, don't get me wrong, I can tell Nicholas Winding Refn is a great director with a lot of potential but he's gotten too full of himself and needs to get back to the basics of writing a compelling story and taking advantage of the actors he casts by giving them solid dialogue.

The acting was fabulous and relied allot on physical expression instead of an overabundance of dialogue! I thought all the actors did great but I loved Jena Malone's character and think she is such an underrated actress who deserves more Kudos!

With allot of Hollywood movies today spoon-feeding audiences with poorly scripted and predictable lines as well as overstimulating the senses with needless explosions and (CGI) that is reminiscent of a video game! A movie such as ""The Neon Demon"" is a real piece of Art! So I feel many people who have given this masterpiece a diminished overview are sadly missing the forest thru the trees! The Refn delivers a thought provoking portrayal into the shallow narcissistic ways of the Hollywood delusion!

A brilliantly done out of the box movie with layers of depth that cannot be understood with just one play thru!

This brings a twisted, murderous  version to a story of a young orphaned girl trying to find her place in the fashion industry.
A hot, glittery mess that ends with cannibalism and bathing in the blood of a virgin, all to creepy, spacey trance music. The plot was painfully slow, and contained many holes. There's no detail, or back story that explains who Jesse (the lead character) is and how she got there.
However, if one reads enough into the movie, you can see that it's a metaphor for what being fresh meat is like in the modeling world. Jesse is virginal both figuratively and literally, naive, and vulnerable and thus is ripped apart and devoured. It is for this reason that I give it any stars at all.
If you are a fan of macabre, noir art, or anything that is bizarre and painfully strange, this may be the movie for you. It's not my cup of tea, and I more or less forced myself to the end. A gutted model is the cherry on this bloody sundae.",1478908800,,1146,4.355140186915888

You had the build up where she told the one girl that she wasn't as helpless as she seemed, also the scene where she described herself as ""dangerous"".

Some of the complaints I've come across are that it's slow, which it is slow paced, has forgettable characters, which I can't argue since I don't believe they were actually trying to make any of them memorable, and absolutely nothing interesting happens, which I disagree with. There was a lot of thought put into this movie, and a lot is being said with pretty much every scene. It's definitely not perfect, not even in the genre it's in. There some scenes that were more drawn out than they needed to be. It actually would have added more to the story to create more distinct characters and wouldn't have distracted from the message at all, which I think is part of why they didn't bother fleshing them out well. Also, there were a couple of times where it felt like the movie was losing it's way, though it did find it's way back by the ending. All in all, it's a pretty good movie, especially for what it was trying to do.

Instead it is a testament and divine sacrifice to what Hollywood finds and exploits as pretty and worthy of the next casting call from moment to moment, stage to stage, couch to couch, and conversation to conversation over small talk about small habits, small addictions and small career spans that in a world for the perfect bodies, faces and egos can never be deep, big or satisfying enough.",1478822400,,705,4.4765625

It starts to get good then there are these awkward or forcefully contrived scenes. The visitor in the hotel room. The damages reimbursement with Keanu. The scene in the coffee shop is a hard contrast between the trained actors, (Jena Malone, Elle Fanning) and the models. The main antagonists, the competing models are not actors. Desmond Harrington delivered on intensity. Keanu was kept at a distance. Karl Glusman did well with bad lines. Disappointing, often seemed close to good, but then just fell short.

Rather, this film is more of a slice of time, an examination of concept and feel instead of deep storytelling.  While there are themes that can be analyzed for hours on end, the primary point of this films seems to be enjoyment of the appearance, feel, beauty, and sound- much like the fashion industry portrayed so well.

On the pros side of things, it is absolutely gorgeous.  Every shot is carefully crafted.  Refn uses the color palette and visuals for a huge chunk of the storytelling.  The music is hypnotic and dreamlike.  It helps you get sucked into this world and really believe in what's happening.  It's fairly well acted (and then there's Jena Malone who practically steals the show) and the characters are interesting.  I really liked the pacing.  The first two acts lull you into this sense of complacency and then the third act hits you like a freight train, which really drove the climax home.

The flip side of everything is that the plot is very empty.  It's a story that's been told and retold.  The only big difference between this movie and every other version of the moral is that this one is incredibly beautiful (which in a way solidifies the theme even more; nobody would care about the movie if it weren't so pretty).  The script can be really disjointed at times, and there were one or two spots where I feel like they edited certain pieces of dialogue to be closer together when there needed to be a longer pause.  The character transitions are incredibly sudden, and it can be off-putting for a lot of people.  For me, I see this story as a modern fairy tale, so I'm able to overlook a lot of these things.

The real divider is that Refn uses some very jarring imagery for shock value rather than to make a point.  Like the empty plot, this can also be tied to the idea that if it weren't such an incredibly shot film we wouldn't be able to stomach what he's doing (even then it's incredibly disturbing).  If you're not able to look past that then this movie is not for you.

Personally, I loved every uncomfortable second.  As I said, I see this as a fairy tale, and I can forgive a lot of it's shortcomings because many fairytales have the same things.  Watch it for yourself and see what you think.",1478736000,,1974,4.415512465373961

Personally I feel to enjoy a movie, you have to be open to experiencing said movies as apposed to watching them. Now I won't say that this is a favorite, and it probably never will be... but I happen to really like this film.  Enough to try an explain that this is more of an artistic film as opposed to your standard horror flick (they're exhausting and simply put- boring IMO). Many reviews talk about the lack of a story in this piece... and I agree.  But it doesn't need a story as I believe it to be more of a thought or narrative. The first watched left me confused but still intrigued.  The second starting to make me ask questions. The third watch gave me the ability to understand what was actually being stated.  For me, that's where the enjoyment lies... in the discovery.

I thought the acting was really good, the cinematography was exceptional, but I've never been a huge fan of strobe lights (why do they even exist).

While there were other solid ensemble performances, they could not save this shallow script with arcs so small we never felt even the slightest bumps, nor did we care by the time we mercifully got to the end, in what was supposed to be the shocker close.

For NWR, while I genuinely enjoyed his ""Only God Forgives"" (Ryan Gosling) and immensely loved ""Bronson"" (Tom Hardy) ""The Neon Demon"" was a film that Nicolas Winding Refn may have to live down.

I can pretty much guarantee that if you're over the age of 40 (especially male), you'll probably be too disturbed by this movie to be entertained by it. It also won't be very relateable. It's definitely an extremely slow movie, but it's coming from the director of ""Drive"", another equally slow movie, so that shouldn't surprise anyone who knows that going into it.

All that said, I'm still glad I watched it, and I won't forget the imagery. Elle Fanning was probably the best she's ever been (definitely made me believe she had that 'thing'), and Nicolas has a real way of directing actors to be more muted, subtle versions of themselves.

Ruby (Jenna Malone) has a scene so obscene and shocking that it is truly the most over the top of the whole movie.

Jesse (Elle Fanning) is capable of morphing from innocent little ingenue to creepy and narcissistic with ease.

Keanu Reeves was under utilized.

Mouths are a very erotic and sensual part of the human body, and two of my favorite scenes involve the mouth (and a knife and spit). What that says about me, I'm not sure, but they are two great scenes that will stick with you.

Of note, Keanu Reeves is a delight in this film. He has a minor role, but he really hasn't been this good since ""The River's Edge,"" and that's a long time.

The boyfriend refuses to discount ""inner beauty""; this theme is effectively illustrated during the scene, but the rest of the movie has neither rhyme nor reason nor theme. The movie contains jaw-dropping visuals, but these effects are interrupted with various scenes lacking reason.

7758342,2,B01G71NN3Q,"I don't know if I watched the same movie as those who are posting 5 star reviews.

Maybe my review is biased because I had heard a lot of hype of this movie.  I had heard it would be an uncomfortable to watch horror movie, with necrophilia, cannibalism and murder.  So, I had gone into the movie, kind of afraid that it would be nothing more than a 'shock' piece (Serbian Film comes to mind as a movie that relied more on shock than being an actual good movie).

But that's not what this movie was.  I wouldn't even consider this movie a 'Horror' or 'mystery' as it's labeled.  There just wasn't much to it.  There's hardly any dialogue, and the imaging is too 'artsy' for my tastes.  I don't need to watch 10 minutes of weird colors and loud EMD music to try to tell a story.

Skip it.  Even though the movie does, technically, deliver on the necrophilia, murder and cannibalism, whatever you have in your mind is probably far scarier/disturbing than what the movie delivers.

If you want a good story, making fun of the fashion industry, read Bret Easton Ellis's Glamorama.  That was a fantastic story, and while I watched this movie, I kept thinking it is a poor-man's Glamorama.",1478563200,,1182,4.47196261682243

As many have said, this is kind of an exercise of style over substance with a lot of things buried under the surface. I admit that I am not enlightened enough to understand any of the deeper symbolism in this movie. I find Refn to be a very intriguing film maker however he obviously doesn't want to be known as a good story teller. It seems he gave that up after the Pusher trilogy and a short return with Drive. I get that it's art but randomly putting a cougar in Jesse's motel room to symbolize something just doesn't do it for me. I imagine when filming, NWR is like, 'yeah let's put a cougar in Jesse's room to show that the modeling industry spells danger. Yeah that will be perfect. A f'in Cougar!""

DRIVE was great. PUSHER was great. but this movie, obviously conceived as a ""comment"" on the commoditization of beauty,
is nothing but pretty pictures all lined up in a row, with nothing of substance to speak for them. Thusly, it betrays the very foundation of the screenplay (co-written with two women who should be appalled at what Refn did with their work).

ONLY GOD FORGIVES gave us fair warning. this new film is identical in visual tone and cinematography, but with far less to think about.
and if that's the message Refn intended to convey (i.e.; that there's no real meat to eat in hollywood, but plenty to just look at), well, in that way, it works. Refn's Hollywood is a kind of Hell on Earth, but there's no devil to stir the pot. He seems to suggest that if you go there, and stick around long enough, or buy into even a tiny slice of ""the dream"", you'll get what you deserve. Gee. Big news, right? Who'd have thunk...will Hollywood ever get enough of films about how terrible a place Hollywood is? I wish i'd just watched SUNSET BLVD again.

In order to grab some  interest, they put it in an unnecessary city. It distracted from the real meat of the writing.  The theme was the absolute vulnerability of the young , innocent, orphan girl who finds herself at age16 with no education, no job, no family at all. She does figure out that she has grown into a pretty girl, tall enough for modeling, so she comes to a city known for modeling. In doing so, she completely has to ""rely on the kindness of strangers"". One rule she forgets is that these strangers are not really her friends just because they ""know her name"". They socialize with her for their own reasons,  She gets a hint of that when she is introduced to two successful models who , to take her down a peg, fake sympathy for the loss of her parents,  one fact of her life that she only shared with the first and only person who offered her kindness and insisted that she have her phone number for emergencies after a mountain lion was in the really sleazy hotel room  rented from really sleazy  Keanu Reeves who offers his tenants, all under age, to random men.

Very slow, but in a superficial way, looking closely with nothing to see. I assume the mostly poor acting was by directorial intent. These actors are good in other films, but not so much here. Breaking taboo for it's own sake is not art, just shock. Which is the one thing this ""thriller"" lacks. No tension,, ever. No shock from some really pretty repulsive stuff. It might be very popular with film students, because that's what it plays like. It looks very nice at times, but over produced images do not make art either.
I just turned it off on first view. I came back several days later, just in case I was missing something, and watched to the end. At least I can say there is no payoff, no reason to watch this.

This movie succeeds somewhat at being an artistic movie about the modeling profession( in the first 30 min). The problem is this version gets drowned by the other two.
The first part of the movie does the artistic version, then the middle of the movie is about the culture of modeling then the last part turns into a horror movie.

Incredibly shallow - not in a good cathartic way. But in the way you buy a cheap piece of chocolate when you can't get the good stuff. Don't waste your time.

Way too slow. Slow shots can be incredibly powerful - but when used in every scene it's just boring and meaningless.

So much could have been done with this narrative. But it was ended in such a sloppy and trite way.

A young girl, ""devoured"" by LA. Give me a break.

The only thing this film has going for it is the sound track and set design. But if you want fantastic art horror films, that have depth AND beauty -  start with Dario Argento's Suspiria. From the 70s and uses the exact same color dynamics in film and set design. So give me a break if Refn is going to take some creative genius card and say, ""oh blue meant sad and red meant anger."" shut up.

I might not be so mad, had I not read an interview where Refn really just gloated on his self assumed genius. There was a part where he talked about the ""profundity"" he experienced in telling Jena Malone to spit in the corpses mouth. Like it was some found act of creative insight and catharsis. Ugh.

That only reflects the shallow perversion that is Refn.

The man who ONLY has a hardboiled egg, a shot of espresso, and two glasses of water (one sparkling) for breakfast each morning. Yes, that was included in the interview. I would only care - if his work was worth a damn, and I wanted to know what a genius ate for breakfast.

The film will not suit many people, it is broad and heavy-handed in the allegory of vanity bringing it's own destruction, and those most likely to stab you in the back are those you trust, and finally in the business where vanity is king, the more successful you are, the more everyone will want to devour you just to get a small bit of what you have.

I found the music to be a key element to augment the visuals, giving the film an almost palpable sensuality, using a throw back to the techno sythisyser of the eighties.  Being an eighties girl, I loved it but I know many who won't.

The line that sums the whole thing up:

I watched this on Prime Video because I was intrigued when I saw the commercials for it because the film looked stylish and visually appealing but the trailer gave little on what the film was about. The substance of the trailer is the substance of the film. It is very little. The film is indeed visually appealing. You'll get that it is a commentary about the narcissism and vanity of the modelling world. For me that was a bit weird because in the US anyway modelling primarily centers around fashion and Hollywood is not a fashion mecca, New York City is.

There were scenes that felt out of place. They stood alone with no real meaning or need other for visual effect or shock value. The mountain lion scene made no sense. The Necrophilia made little sense and was not needed other to give a a shocking moment. The menses scene in the end was a real wtf moment as well.

Part of me wonders if major cuts had to happen because the film does push close to the 2-hour mark. If that is the case, I hope a director's cut comes out. Maybe these incoherent scenes might make sense.

7758423,2,B01G71NN3Q,"Elle Fanning is not beautiful.  And that is a real problem in a movie that is primarily, perhaps ONLY, visual.
You see her next to women who are obviously far more beautiful than she is (next to them, Elle looks like a pretty truck-stop waitress), but we're supposed to pretend they are fake-looking dogs. Due to some dialogue toward the beginning, including the bathroom scene when one model tries to suck on Jesse's (Elle) blood, I had high hopes that the movie was about Jesse having that ""indefinable something"", not beauty, talent, innocence or youth but something less tangible and irresistible, and a thousand times less fair than simple beauty.  If Elle was supposed to be an ""it"" girl, I could have believed the premise.  Elle being less beautiful than almost everyone else in the film isn't her fault, because unlike her character, Elle has acting talent.  Miscasting, perhaps?
Yes, but the much bigger problem is that the director just doesn't have enough imagination or insight to realize there are some qualities more enticing and dangerous than beauty.  That is indicative of the lack of brains behind this film.  Sure if you like giallo there are no words for how much you will love this film because so many scenes have virtually no purpose but to be as disgusting and/or beautiful looking or as shocking as possible.  Just as an example of the dumb derivative nature of the story line is the obsession with Jesse's virginity.  Why?  Do we believe this girl could possibly be a virgin? Of course not.  And what does that have to do with anything anyway?  Irrelevant, because the director intends to draw his plot points from high-school slasher movies.  Then at the end one of the women, um, appears to bleed copiously from her womb.  Again, it seems, the female body is so very mysterious and treacherous.  Sure Mr Male Director.
Here's probably the bottom line: If you don't watch beautiful looking movies much, you will probably think this is a masterpiece.  If you do, well...",1478390400,,1996,4.812316715542522

I like Elle and I am sorry but this movie sucked big time. Maybe I just cannot appreciate the ""artistic expression"" in whatever world this would be called a cult classic. The acting is terrible, even Keanu Reeves acting feels stiff and uncomfortable and the dialog is almost non-existent throughout most of the movie, it is mostly just weird visuals. The only time any real horror is felt in the movie is when Elle Fanning's character is being chased through a house by the really bad actresses who play the models and a make-up artist and even that is bad. Why do people always run up and not out when they are caught in this type of situation? It was all I could do to sit through this disaster, I kept waiting for it to get better but it just didn't. After it was over I just sort of sat and stared at the tv and wondered when was the last time I saw a movie this painful to watch and I couldn't remember. So for my 2 cents, don't waste your time on this. If you want to see Elle Fanning in a decent role go watch Maleficent with Angelina Jolie at least her acting in that movie felt natural and not like some decision was made and regretted later then she was forced to finish it.",1478390400,3,1353,4.207692307692308

If Fanning thought this would be a good role to transition her to more adult roles, she could have done much better.

Refn's story of a young girl arriving in LA and breaking into the modeling industry is both beautiful to look at (the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous) and deeply disturbing and I could not stop thinking about it.  The other girls she meets all covet her stunning, natural beauty and either want a piece of her or to destroy her; culminating in some truly shocking scenes.  While many have called these scenes gratuitous, I felt they really worked in terms of taking the idea of possessing another person's beauty to the ultimate degree.  I also found the ultra-stylized direction gave the movie a sort of nightmare fairytale quality that serves the horrific plot quite well.  Elle Fanning is perfectly cast as the ingenue who gets more and more lost in the attention, increasingly transforming into another self-absorbed narcissist.  The standout performance however comes from Jena Malone who absolutely crushes it as Ruby.  I could not take my eyes off of her when she was on screen, and I found her performance both brave and mesmerizing.  She telegraphs a huge amount of information and nuance in a glance or change in facial expression.  The look on her face when she's sitting in that bathtub will probably haunt me for quite a while...  No this movie is not for everyone, and yeah it's probably at least 20 minutes too long, but if you love beautiful imagery and are willing to experience a really dark take on female jealousy and competitiveness, then buckle up and enjoy the ride.",1478304000,,1616,4.8014440433212995

7758565,1,B01G71NN3Q,"After hearing about the plot and seeing who was in it (and directed it) I expected this movie to be exactly the kind of whacked out weirdness I enjoy. I'm a fan of movies that take their time to tell their story. 2001, Beyond the Black Rainbow, practically everything Tarkovsky ever made, all of these movies make it clear that you are in their world and they'll move at the pace they damn well please. Where those movies and this one differ is that those movies use their pace to create worlds. This one just uses it to create headaches and tedium all in the name of trying to flip you on your head in the end.

Unfortunately this movie doesn't even give you a glimpse of the world it's trying to create until about twenty minutes from the end, by which time you just don't care. This is very much done on purpose to try for a ""whiplash"" effect. Compare it with Takashi Miike's Audition. With that movie you're pulled in by what you think will be one story, only to have it chipped away over time. Here it's one story then suddenly you're just in a horror anthology show.

It does not work for me at all. The components never add up, and there are pieces missing. Go watch the aforementioned Audition for a similar movie done much better. Go watch Bronson if you want to see how good Nicolas Winding Refn can be.

The worst thing is that one of my favorite Keanu Reeves performances is hidden in here. His character is by far the most interesting in the whole movie.",1478304000,3,1467,4.346715328467154

This was nothing near Drive. But, overall, it was a very intriguing movie. It had a lot of aesthetically pleasing scenes, and it was vibrant and lively, but also dark and dangerous. The only scene that threw me off was the necrophilia bit (sorry if that's a spoiler). However, I got to thinking, maybe a few days after the movie processed in my mind, that NWF is apologetically out there when it comes to making films. Love him or hate him- you'll be talking about his work. Highly recommend checking out 'Drive' and 'Only God Forgives.'

A young girl moves to California from smalltown, USA.  She is only 16 and pretty naive.  The older models aged 20-24 or so are all threatened by her.  The LA scene is full of partying, drugs, sex, violence, etc and she is sort of thrown in the meat grinder so to speak.  I found the film refreshing as it's been a while since I've seen a movie which i really like.

Keanu Reaves usually plays leading roles, but he has the role here of a creepy motel owner/manager.  He nailed the part to a T.  I wish there was more of him in it.

The slow-motion delivery of this not-scary-at-all not-horror flick made it impossible to drag my browser along the motion line at the bottom of the screen, much like flipping to the last few pages of a book to see, for the love of God, what happens.
And, frankly, nothing happens. Nothing shows up as a 16-year-old beauty named Jesse, in LA, ready for a modeling career which just takes off, because she possesses that certain something that photographers and designers look for.  She starts out as an innocent, but can't help herself from liking her own looks just enough to annoy those around her who are aging in a youth-oriented business. It doesn't end well for her. But. It didn't have to take so long.
Keanu Reaves, oh, where did you go after Speed and Matrix? You can't act, so you play a disgusting motel owner, in a twenty-second performance a couple of times.
The most fascinating character was the photographer who first sees the possibilities after painting her with gold paint. I think they got him right...the artist with an acute eye, but the only real guy here

7758612,4,B01G71NN3Q,"My stomach hurts. I just saw a movie that physically made my own body ache after seeing the depravity of such characters. This movie is beautiful in an otherworldly kind of way. Some scenes do not seem real, and when they are real, they are still very dream like. The whole world of fashion is this illusion that humans created and somehow society has went along with the idea. I believe the director is trying to tell a tale of how we allowed soulless demons to have created the beauty industry as an organization that can controls thoughts, feelings, and actions of others. This movie is very smart. To a less sensitive eye, it could come off as some weird art film with gore and death. But to a more sensitive person, you may see beyond this first level of understanding and deeper into the darkness of the spiritual message and dare I say, warning that is being made through out the movie. I will tell you, there are some parts that I had to look away from, they are THAT disturbing, but looking past even that, I see there was a purity in intention to create this movie. Deep in this movie is a warning and a calling to people to WAKE up and see what the beauty industry has done to so many women..and men....and how beauty is something that literally can drive a person insane enough to do unthinkable acts of evil.

The movie is a bit of a tale of dark temptation and unlike Narcissus from the Greek myth, this character is taken over by something....other than herself. Something that humans have created in their lust, greed, covet for external and superficial vanity and pleasure. Many of the sins, that the religious texts warns us against.

The ending will make you think about beauty, the strength of it in this world, and the way humans have responded to it over so many years, as well as the endless abyss of vanity. If you truly like a movie that will make you reflect deeply upon the inner workings of the beauty industry, as well as nature of beauty itself, than watch this movie and be prepared to be shown true ugliness of people too.

One of the positives outcomes from this movie, is you walk away appreciating your own unique beauty that is not necessarily external because you see so much ugliness in these girls. Got to know the dark, before you know the light. Enjoy!",1478131200,2,2293,4.4677804295942725

7758620,4,B01G71NN3Q,"This movie reminds me a lot of Black Swan.  The FMC has moments of lucidity alternating with increasingly surreal scenes that may or may not be hallucinations, and the overall mood is simultaneously sensual and disturbing.  If you loved Black Swan, there's a decent chance you'd enjoy this.  If you thought Black Swan was terrible, you'll probably hate this movie.  The Neon Demon is one of those films that you either love or hate, as evidenced by the equal number of one and five star reviews.  As I said, it's not for everyone.

To hit on a few points--the necrophilia and cannibalism are short, minor scenes that aren't particularly ""explicit"" and are done well enough that they don't come across as empty shock value.  The purpose of these scenes is primarily mood, since this is a psychological horror with a non-linear plot that is intentionally foggy.  However, there is one scene in the last 90 seconds of the movie that is very very nauseating, don't eat while you're watching this.  This is NOT a ""family friendly"" film; do not watch it with your kids or your easily offended religious grandma.  You have been warned.

A lot of the comments that this movie seems amateurish or badly done are probably referring to a recurring reel where the FMC hallucinates meaningless geometric shapes flashing against a black background for no apparent reason. Those scenes really cheapen what would have otherwise been an exceptional psychological horror, and they are the reason I didn't give it five stars.

When aspiring model Jesse moves to Los Angeles, her youth and vitality are devoured by a group of beauty-obsessed women who will use any means necessary to get what she has!

This is another brilliant movie from the director of Drive, this is certainly his best since, a visual treat of a movie from beginning to end that's brought to life by an awesome cast, Elle Fanning absolutely shines and certainly fits the role more perfect than anyone you can imagine, this is certainly a role not to forget, the rest of the entire cast is spot on too, maybe Keanu is slightly out of place though. the story is well paced out with shady characters and a very dark atmosphere throughout, great visual shots and fantastic music, the soundtrack is amazing and is one of the best this year, it really helps carry the movie, the movie has a very horror related theme, its almost more horror than thriller, you could almost call it a fairy-tale with its surreal moments, there's blood necrophilia and a lot of bitchiness from a top mainly female cast, I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants something a little different, It will of course not appeal to everyone but masterpiece none the less it is.

The only true excitement of the Neon Demon lied within the propaganda and marketing of this movie. It looks promising, colorful, dark, sexy, edgy.. and although it is full of modern elegance, and lots of glitter, it is thoroughly lackluster at best. Elle fanning fails to deliver, what I feel could have truly been a dynamic breakthrough role as the antagonist, Jesse the beautiful young ingenue to the modeling world.

The film is a long, drawn out, boring, music video with no music. The synthesizer score is a fun nod to the 80's horror genre, but built you up for no reason.

The ""plot twist"" is tired and not shocking at all.

If you want a beautiful cast, incredible costumes, sexual tension, a real horror theme and A STORY...I recommend Penny Dreadful.

7758709,3,B01G71NN3Q,"The Neon Demon is a grim look at the Los Angeles modeling world. Jesse (Elle Fanning), a 16-year-old orphan fresh off the bus, is looking to be the next girl to hit it big as a high-paid fashion model. When we first meet her, Jesse is the archetypal Middle America girl-next-door. Her youth and beauty attract the attention of bigwigs in the fashion business. When she undergoes the requisite transformation, she clearly stands out among her fellow models. She befriends make-up artist Ruby (Jena Malone) and observes firsthand the cynicism and jealousy of older model Gigi (Bella Heathcote) as she navigates this new and often bizarre world.

Director Nicolas Winding Refn has created a film as cold as an iceberg. The theme, that beauty is the ultimate currency in a business that ultimately consumes its young, is hardly new, but Refn has a visual flair that keeps the eye entertained even as the story fails to deliver the dramatic impact he intended. Ms. Fanning is effective in showing both the physical but spiritual changes in Jesse. After costume, hair and make-up professionals have finished their work, its as if they have deadened her soul. In contrast with her earlier liveliness, Jesse now has the blank stare common to models.

Special features on the R-rated Blu-ray release include audio commentary with director Nicolas Winding Refn and Elle Fanning; Behind the Soundtrack of The Neon Demon; and a making-of featurette.",1475193600,,1437,5.033613445378151

With a running time of just under 2 hours that I'm pissed I'll never get back and an entire script that was probably written on a Post-It, because there was almost NO dialogue, The Neon Demon SUCKED. Cannibalism, necrophilia, rape, murder, and a beautiful scene in which a model barfs up an eyeball of a model she ate, garrotes herself, only to have the other model reach into the pile of vomit, pick out the eyeball and ingest it.

Being partial, Jena Malone, cannot do any wrong. She is always on point and has such a screen presence!

The soundtrack is interesting, and the ""glitter"" cue in the score was a cool touch.  The ""Demon Dance"" that was featured in the trailer track works well on dance floors and feels like a song you'd hear during fashion week.

Yeah you catch my point?..""you name him or her, you get to know each other but & the end of the day food is food remember that & Pappa's gunna eat so yes this movie would be kinda a waist if it got all emotional & then all a sudden..next time you come to LA look out because in can suck you in..Too much of anything is bad including beauty. jk!
Amazing soundtrack & visual art piece as-well a short story about, the same story the re accors everyday over & over with these girls it's crazy but it's just great in a colorful way. It reminds me of a amovie called ""8mm"" with nic-cage. It also reminds me of black swan..
 It not the kind of movie that's trying to win anything, it's showing you a little armpit of a city that any normal person would never venture down. After your done watching this movie & 8mm, I was left with the same feeling, It's not happy or sad, I felt kinda sick to be honest..The worst of the worst things That happened out there we'll never find out because people covered up there tracks & cleaned out there tracks if you know what I mean? This is a must have for me because im a photographer in Culver City & I shot many things similar to what's in this movie high fashion stuff & fetish but never girls fight like this that I've seen, it's more of behind each other's back every now & then but never competitive like top model or NYC or France it's more of just artsy stuff like at the start of this film but yeah I've never seen anything like what's in this movie if I did I call the freaking cops or just start running because dang them girls are scary! I loved when the photographer (with Elle) gets to go back to his roots with ambient lighting hands on body painting just wonderful because like wedding photography, runway/fashion can get dull & ""same old same old"" with someone like her you don't have to ""work"" at all, you can just shoot & shoot.

7758770,1,B01G71NN3Q,"This movie is garbage. Straight up. NWR doesn't have ""it"" anymore. He's lazy. He's a ""stylist"" now. He's not a real film maker. He doesn't have anything to say. He doesn't have ""balls"" or something new to add to anything. He's done for. He's lost. This movie has no characters, no story, no natural dialogue, themes that are old-news and super on the nose, a terrible ending and nothing and no one to care about or be interested in. It's a tremendous work of hubris and gruelingly boring. There's nothing erotic, dangerous or engaging about this junk. It's an embarrassment on many levels. NWR is a joke and his pride will never allow him to recover and genuinely make good cinema ever again. He's too comfortable, too tired, to busy. He'll probably make more stylish junk without the nuance or raw energy of his PUSHER films, people who don't have many reference points to good art house will love it, the rest of us will just be depressed that a once great artist rather take the easy way out. There's no other way to say it... NWR is the Danish Kevin Smith, but much less endearing, since he comes off as a pretension artist without the slightest understanding of how much money and time he's wasted with his last two films. Hossein Amini's script for DRIVE gave NWR the foundation to build a solid art house crime drama. After that, NWR didn't realize that writing was important and without Hossein Amini, he'd have nothing today... BRONSON and VALHALLA RISING were unstructured messes as well, but they were so much better than the garbage he's been putting out after his ego blew up with DRIVE's critical success... I don't know what to say... I'm just depressed and feeling insulted that I wasted my time and money on this hollow shell of a ""movie"".",1473206400,8,1756,4.631410256410256

7758781,5,B01G71NN3Q,"An unique and daring experience doesn't even begin to scratch the surface when referring to the Neon Demon. Lead actress, Elle Fanning, is excellent throughout, delivering a very believable and unflinching performance. Jena Malone is also fantastic with some jaw-dropping and steamy scenes that will leave you speechless. In addition, Keanu Reeves is awesome as always with spot-on delivery and dark humor. Altogether the cast is dope and definitely made this film a compelling watch.

Like most Refn films, the ending is something you either love or hate. The latter is probably the go-to choice for the majority of viewers that watch this film. But that doesn't mean this film is bad, or the story is bland, or whatever you may read in the one-star reviews. The ending is EXACTLY what I was looking for: something unexpected, thinky (yes I said think-y), and weird. The Neon Demon is categorized as a Horror film on some sites, and as a horror film, this film delivers, trust me. There is a scene in particular that is truly eye-popping!

If you're on the fence about renting or buying this film, let me help you. If you enjoyed films like: American Gigolo, Drive, The Counselor, or Under the Skin, then you should definitely check out the Neon Demon. This film shares similar characteristics of the other films I mentioned, in terms of: acting, pacing, music, and style. OH and the soundtrack in the Neon Demon is super dope and just pure ear-candy! Just saying!!",1473033600,7,1466,4.86
7758782,5,B01G71NN3Q,"This film is the definition of cult classic, it has a very dark and evil essence throughout the entire film. The intro is hypnotic with the amazing score, and brilliant cinematography will blow any movie aficionado out of the water. The imagery, use of color, is mesmerizingly breautiful, but it's drenched in blood.

A lot of people think this is a horror movie, with jumpscares... it's not, it's much more than that. The visuals tell the story, incredibly beautiful along with the characters, but the soul of the story and characters is dark and very sinister. Neon represents the beauty, and the Demon is how people act and stop at nothing to be beautiful and better than someone else. Elle Fanning is in real life the perfect, wholesome girl that is thrown into an industry that is vain and greedy. She cannot help that she is widely excepted by the pedophilic industry, the top models in the industry are jealous of her and stop at nothing to have what she has.

Great casting includes Keanu Reeves, a hotel landlord that has a sick mind, Jena Malone and her AMAZING acting (she brings so much to this movie), Bella Heathcote and Abby Lee are the shallow, plastic models that are friends with Elle's character in the beginning and well.. it goes sour at the end.

This is going to be a cult classic, the dark demonic soul of this movie by the amazing director Refn has made a stunning masterpiece.

Elle Fanning is a raising star and an excellent star, she is great in this. The beginning of the movie juxtaposes horror with reality, which mixed very well. The soundtrack is awesome, Cliff Martinez is stellar at soundtrack (he should get oscars). The only thing I didn't like was the ending + last 10-15 minutes, it just went against the rest of the whole film at that point and felt bizarre.

7758805,2,B01G71NN3Q,"Im shocked at the reviews praising this movie.  Men lusting for an underage girl, implied sex trafficking and raping of a 13 year old girl, a woman trying to rape the main underage girl then later masturbates on a corpse, jealous women murdering the girl and using her blood to bathe in before or after consuming her body. And that about wraps it up. Seriously. There is clearly an agenda going on right now to push perversions on women to make them believe they are just as perverted and deranged as men, which just isn't true. Women are biochemically made to feel compassion from an abundance of oxytocin, which men don't have. But if you notice, lately, they keep pushing things like pedophilia and incest and rape for female roles in movies and shows. This movie is full of masonic symbolism for mind control. You will see these similar things in other movies like Starry Eyes and Beyond the Black Rainbow. The moral of the movie is that youth are willingly giving up their innocence now, and those who don't will have it taken from them. The woman named ""Ruby"" in this movie has a bow tattooed on her chest. She is what's known as a ""prepper"" which are people who were abducted from a very young age and conditioned to prepare a killing ritual, or whatever else they are told. Notice she is lifeless and sad, completely lost and lonely in every shot except one. She waits for the photographer (her handler) to give her orders, and after killing the girl at the house that she ""cares for"" she sprays down the blood coldly as though she has done it a thousand times before. Do some research and you will see for yourself. Look up ""The Franklin Cover-Up"". They're putting it all out there now and Amazon funded this piece of garbage. I give it two stars for the haunting effects and cinematography alone. They could've done this movie about an 18 year old who pretends to be 19, no sex trafficking or necrophilia or cannibalism, just a well-written dark thriller about the modeling/acting industry preying on naive youth/adults. But alas, it's not about quality filmmaking, it's about slowly desensitizing the public to their true nature. And apparently it's working.",1472688000,,2169,4.692913385826771

She stays in a sleazy motel which provides a few WTF moments, with Keanu Reeves playing the motel owner. Jesse claims she ""is not as helpless as she looks"" and the film turns weird after an hour or so and continues to go down a path until you don't have closure. Okay. It's a metaphor.

The film seems to be making a statement about the fashion industry and 15 minutes of fame every nubile gets until they turn 20-ish and there is always one coming along, same as the old one. They used real models as extras. I could have gone four stars had they cast Susan Dey (is she still alive?) as the casting director. I think that would have made for a stronger message.

There is a ton of metaphor going on here, like the main character's emergence on to the cat walk for the first time which was basically a birth scene with a neon triangle womb symbolizing her birth in to a world of compromised envy, lust and betrayal.

Be warned it's slow at times; scenes play out with little or no dialogue, but the cinematography is breathtaking.

Its frames are sweet visual poison and the soundtrack is absolutely hypnotizing. It is totally unique in the way it subverts what we expect from a modern horror movie. This is a cerebral terror that culminates in a vicious sequence that would leave Elizabeth Bathory saying, ""get it girl!"". Watch this with the lights off and the music up.

It was literally hypnotic with Cliff Martinez's amazing score helping immensely. Has to be one of the best scores in film history. The third act is what really threw me from complete involvement. It was really mind boggling. Maybe repeated viewings will help. The performances were great especially Jena Malone and Keanu Reeves (in a truly scary performance).

7758815,5,B01G71NN3Q,"Despite the amount of colorful creativity and deviant storytelling found in Neon Demon, I find myself at a loss for words for where to begin to describe it. I'll start with the soundtrack, which as of now, is my favourite movie score of 2016. It's easy enough to create a synth based soundtrack, but it's another feat to create one that I instantly desire once the film is over. It's filled to burst with mesmerizing drones of dreamlike cadence, and sinfully sweet synth rythms that smother your ears to the point where you can hear colors.

Moving on to direction and cinematography, my god, Nicolas Winding Refn has found an incredible collaboration with cinematographer Natasha Braier. They waste no time in their effort to make you feel completely absorbed in the skin-deep colors and visuals of Neon Demon. Its masterful framing and careful attention to focus makes the actors, specifically Elle Fanning, stand out and blend in all at once in every scene.

Fanning plays Jesse, a hopeful 16 year old girl who has come to LA in hopes of making money off the only talent she claims to possess, beauty. Slowly but surely, the ""deer in headlights"" stare of innocent Jesse devolves into gazes of assured ego and power as she succeeds where her senior models fail. Quietly but triumphantly she says, ""I don't want to be them. They want to be me."" We tag along with Jesse into a story of uncomfortable and soulless surrealism with a turn of events that can only be seen to be believed.

Chris Rodley described David Lynch's work as ""producing a disturbing unfamiliarity in the evidently familiar."" And in Freud's words, ""the uncanny is uncanny because it is secretly all too familiar, which is why it is repressed."" I feel the same can be said for Winding's sickly satirical look at modeling in this day and age. From the get-go Jesse is slapped with scornful and snide remarks about her beauty and social standing by experienced models, but it never feels over-the-top or unconvincing. You feel as though these models are vipers who are on the verge of striking out at Jesse as their envy builds through the film and reaches disturbing levels. And the fact that all of these events are happening to a 16 year old girl only adds to your discomfort as you unknowingly squirm in your seat.

Despite the heights of dread and unforgettably morbid imagery Neon Demon reaches, for me, it never feels out of our reality. Just like Lynch's Blue Velvet, Neon Demon digs deep into a familiar element of culture and society and shows us the nightmares it hides under its plastic smile. A slow burn til the very end, Neon Demon is a sinfully stylish tale of the lengths people will go to achieve their dreams and, more importantly, beauty.",1470700800,5,2725,4.718487394957983
7758816,4,B01G71NN3Q,"Few directors are as polarizing as Nicolas Winding Refn; basically you either love him or you hate him. Or in some cases he inspires hate and adoration in equal measure within each individual. That's the place where I tend to fall. Refn has cornered the market in art house movies for tough guys, hammering out muscular flicks such as Bronson, Valhalla Rising, and his semi-mainstream curveball Drive, all of which found a decent enough mix between style and depth so as not to be considered too shallow. The same can't be said of his last effort, the nihilistic and boring Only God Forgives which found a way to make Ryan Gosling kicking ass throughout Bangkok snooze-worthy.

The Neon Demon is exactly where Refn needs to be, embracing his gruesome, shallow side with unabashed glee and a gallon of blood. Refn is, in the shallowest of ways, attacking the shallowness of Hollywood and the way it must continually feed on youthful energy to survive. Only, he's not even attempting to be coy about it. His delight in every tawdry frame will only be matched by the guilty joy audiences will have at watching beautiful, porcelain Hollywood princesses devouring one another body and soul.

The story is as old as time, but then nothing is truly common when Refn gets a hold of it. Elle Fanning plays vacuous beauty Jesse, who arrives in the neon demon aka Los Angeles to become part of the fashion scene. Refn's vision of L.A. is instantly sinister, like a neon-lit waking nightmare of terminal narcissism. Jesse's gorgeous and beauty is really the only thing of value in the world she's trying to crack. But it's her innocence that makes her stand out among the crowd of catty, plastic witches who reek of desperation and, let's face it, are in their 20s and getting older.

Everybody Jesse encounters has an ulterior motive, even her friends. Jena Malone is fantastic as Ruby, a make-up artist who takes the newbie starlet under her wing.  Dont worry, the deer-in-the-headlights thing is exactly what they want. she tells her. And it's true. Jesse instantly becomes the new hot ticket item, quickly surpassing the nip/tucked phoniness of Gigi (Bella Heathcote) and Sarah (Abbey Lee). They become old news overnight, and if they were downright bitchy before it's cranked up to the nth degree once Jesse becomes a star. These pouty, dolled-up goddesses are downright mafia-esque in their duplicity. They simultaneously want Jesse's destruction and everything the clueless girl has.

It's all just surface material, though, and Refn likes it that way. He's not saying anything especially new or clever here, and that's part of the fun. Every bit of The Neon Demon is transparently frivolous, offering Refn and cinematographer Natasha Brier the platform to indulge in every feverish, surreal scenario they can think of. Some of it makes sense, most of it doesn't. Random panther in a shady motel room? Check. Nausea-inducing strobe light trapeze acts? Check. Occasional lesbian dalliances with the living and the not-so-living? Check. Refn's odd fascination with triangles continues, as well, almost as if he's trying to initiate the audience into a cult of his own making.

But all of that is just the tip of the iceberg for this gross, deliciously vile spectacle, which moves along at Refn's typically unhurried pace. Don't let that lead you to believe it's boring. There's way too much scathing humor for it to ever be dull. Most of it comes from the catty comments made by the foursome of ladies, but others are simply the GIF-ready facial expressions by the disgusting, pretentious men populating this corner of the Hellmouth. The best of which is Alessandro Nivola as the unbearably conceited fashion designer who makes Jesse his new muse. The look on his face the first time he sees her is priceless. Keanu Reeves plays the creepy owner of the rundown motel Jesse is staying at; a guy who houses underage prostitutes and may even be raping them. He's the scum beneath scum's feet. And there's also Karl Glusman, known for starring in Gaspar Noe's Love, as the empty-headed but loyal guy we know is destined to be treated like dirt at some point. We aren't disappointed. Every character is objectified to the point of near-worship, most of all Fanning who is captivating and yet we're put off by her because of Refn's obvious fascination with her face. The camera never stays away from it for too long, like a leering, dangerous stalker waiting to strike.

Whether it was a conscious decision on Refn's part to attack the ""style over substance"" critique by making The Neon Demon overtly superficial is unknown, and it doesn't really matter. What he's done is create the ultimate in trash cinema, one that ends in an erotic orgy of blood and death. Does any of it mean a thing? Absolutely not, and that's perfectly okay.",1470182400,,4820,4.885085574572127

7758818,1,B01G71NN3Q,"Okay, you have Elle Fanning, most commonly known for her princess role in Disney's ""Maleficent"". Also a terrific actress in other movies like ""Super 8"".  I have to question her reasoning for agreeing to take on the lead role in this movie.  Will it add on to her fame?  Probably not.

This movie was in only one of our local 3 participating theaters.  And was only on the ""small screen"" in the 12 am room, the only time they played it......... for about 5 days......  I can't believe I wasted my money on that.

This is not horror.  This is one of those movies where you watch it and it messes with your mind after.  You see some really messed up stuff in here.  Yes, Elle Fanning plays Jesse, the girl who has an unknown background.  All we know is her parents are dead and her only talent is the fact that she ""knows she is pretty"", ""and pretty makes money"".  She does not believe she can do anything else in her life, a wanderer, innocent in every way, lonely, polite, living in poverty, reserved, naive, yet a bit shockingly arrogant, and has the ability to get what she wants, merely by her beauty and not at all by deception.  She gets interviews by psychotic beauty seekers.  She gets the photo shoots her jealous rivals before her always dreamed of.

This would all sound like some dream come true, but her mentors, jealous beauty rivals, photographers, even down to the sleazy motel owner; literally everyone but her and a nice guy who really likes her.........is really psychotic....  which leads to her demise.

Death scenes are only near the very end of the movie.  There is no real moments of anticipation to find. Yet there is nothing predictable.  Just really messed up, disturbing, gory scenes.  Jesse is basically used and abused, yet accomplishes everything the other models failed or were to old to do.

The good points?  I would have to start with the fact that the movie emphasizes true and real beauty does not require plastic surgery and if you have to go to those extremes, you are worthless to real beauty.

Second, I would have to say like others, the art scenery is unusual, but unique.  Sometimes visually stunning.  Sometimes scary.  Sometimes reeling you in.  Set to repetitive electronica style music. Sometimes making you think.  Sometimes making you bored because it drags on like a very long techno song that the DJ at a nightclub started out really good at, but then kept the same mix running with no changes for several minutes while you await a new song.  I do like how the music gets louder as the ""stunning artwork"" seems to creep up in front of you slowly.

Thank heavens Elle is still under 18 at the time of this review, as nudity was only implied with her.  The actual nudity was her insane mortician mentor locking the door in the morgue to do some really disturbing things to a dead girl......  I said dead.  Not 2 girls dead.  One alive, one dead. Eww.

So the name of the movie.... Let's take ""Neon"".  Could it come from the neon (in color) lights during photo shoots and fashion showings?  The movie ad and posters, covers, etc. seem to portray this movie as some sort of cult or satanic movie with the triangle meaning something in a ritual, or like a symbol in ""Paranormal Activity"" films.  Not so.  Now let's take ""Demon"".  All of Jesse's good qualities do not possess any bad inner qualities.  She claims her ""parents used to call her dangerous"", and she claims they were right about that statement.  So with a background we no nothing about could be the ""Demon"".  Or the fact that she gets reeled in at times, scared at first to fit in, but can warm up quickly.  Or the fact that the ""Demon"" in her is her ability to get into the ""Neon"" limelight of it all without trying, but by capturing those and being captured simply because she has natural beauty that some are jealous of, some want nothing but her, some wanting to hurt her.  Is it her inner ""Demon"" from the past we don't now, or her innocence that could be easily targeted and influenced?  We may never know.

Yes, this movie makes you think, yet at the same time extremely disturbing.  You get mixed emotions about Jesse.  A mystery past life, you feel sorry for her, you feel afraid for her, yet see arrogance and then you see someone who just wants to make a living, dangerously.  You fear for her, yet know she makes her own choices.  You realizes her choices are not the best.  So there is a lot of emotional value in this movie, which is perfect if you like completely disturbing to the max.....

""Horror"" would describe Jason or Freddy Krueger.  this is indescribable.  Yet, would not want to see again, and wish I never saw it.

Yes, Elle Fanning played her part very well, captured lots of emotions, yet why she agreed to something like this?  Was it an attempt to the usual teen doing what it takes to ""break away from being owned by Disney?""

The ""eyeball ending"".......  really gross and made me glad I decided not to have that popcorn.",1468800000,2,4960,4.507865168539326

Elle Fanning is outstanding. The soundtrack is pretty good, but for the recurrent annoying and loud 80's electronic music.

7758820,5,B01G71NN3Q,"""Beauty is the highest currency."" So proclaims a fashion designer with authority in Nicolas Winding Refn's brutal, beautiful masterpiece, The Neon Demon, a horror-film satire about consumer culture set in L.A.'s fashion scene.

Simply named the Fashion Designer, Alessandro Nivola's character holds court at a trendy restaurant to a table of adoring, nubile models, each more stunning than the next.

But he's really addressing just one girl (you can hardly call these exquisite stunted children women), a 16-year-old newbie named Jesse who sits apart from the crowd, luxuriating in the designer's velveteen attention.

Portrayed by a mesmerizing Elle Fanning (Maleficent, Trumbo) in a magnificent, heart-stopping star turn, Jesse has become an overnight success after her first runway show.

At turns seductive and repulsive about its world of dangerous sex and violence, The Neon Demon combines horror movie tropes with arresting images and clever references to a body of genre entries, including Hammer Films' Dracula pictures, Cat People, and The Hunger.

At its center unspools a simple, if highly ambiguous, narrative thread. The first half follows Jesse's transformation from a fresh, healthy all-American virgin into a narcissistic mannequin for haute couture snobs.

We follow Jesse as she goes through the rituals of the fashion world: endless photo shoots with a sadistic photographer (Desmond Harrington), dress fittings, runway shows, and parties.

Lots of parties.

Midway, the story shifts into a bloody revenge tale about three girls Jesse has wronged on her way up the ladder: two fellow models (Bella Heathcote and Abbey Lee Kershaw) and a lesbian hair-and-makeup artist with a taste for necrophilia.

Jena Malone is sexy and menacing as the stylist who goes all Fatal Attraction when Jesse rebuffs her advances. Pushing the envelope farther than you thought possible, Refn has the three girls unleash hell on Jesse. The ending is gory, strange, and really funny.

A bold visionary artist, Refn seems able to revel in the culture of instant gratification while also subjecting it to critique. Since his breakout work, the Pusher trilogy, he's created a body of mind-blowing cult pictures including Bronson, Valhalla Rising, Drive, and Only God Forgives.

In The Neon Demon, Refn lashes out at the dehumanizing effects of the market, where any object or person can be assigned a price. Jesse is reduced to a consumer product without agency.

Yet there's something else going on. The Neon Demon also has a religious dimension. The ritual sacrifice of girls, it seems to suggest, is a cult that defines and sustains our society.

What's difficult to figure out is whether Refn believes his own cant. Does he love the world he depicts or despise it?",1467676800,3,2763,5.280821917808219
7758821,4,B01G71NN3Q,"Jesse is a young teen who dreams of making it big in the world of modeling. Moving to Los Angeles, she believes she has a chance. But she slowly begins to realize that the world of fame and beauty is much darker than she thought. As more begin to praise her for her beauty, the further Jesse follows the path of darkness in not only herself, but in the world shes entered.

This new drama/horror film is presented by Nicholas Winding Refn who brought the beautiful thrill ride that was drive. This time around, Refn stays with the beautiful drama, but adding in horror to the mix. The film itself isn't entirely horror, but instead its a drama that follows the path to horror along with the character Jesse herself. The film is gorgeous too look at with the bright neon colors, and the craft of lighting, but also the chilling and at times beautiful score by Cliff Martinez. If this wasn't an independent art film, and had been a script adapted for modern audiences, this could have a super predictable film. While the story is more less been seen before, its much more serious in the fact that we follow our lead character so close in her changes and her world that we really get a grasp on everything shes experiencing. When the final act comes around and it becomes a full-on horror film, the shift is just pure shocking and we are left thinking, what in the hell is happening. Its not that its random, but because we cant believe it went as far as it does, despite the fact that weve been following the path to this from the get-go. To me, the ending was perfectly dark and disturbing and should have ended with the bathroom scene. That would have been a huge punch in the gut, and an even darker way to end it. However, everything after the bathroom scene fall into the category of very over-the-top and just plain silly.

Elle Fanning delivers a beautiful and haunting performance as Jesse and does a marvelous job of showing Jesses gradual changes through the film as we see her change before our eyes. It is this performance that genuinely shows she has a great future ahead of her (even though her breakout role in Super 8 already did show this). Jena Malones performance as the mysterious Ruby who befriends Jesse provides her best performance yet. Malone perfectly captures the mystery of this character and keeps us guessing whether we can trust her or not.

Neon Demon is a beautiful film in every aspect in terms of script, cinematography, score, direction, and acting. I wish I could say I loved the film, but sadly, the silliness of the films ultimate ending really hurt this one for me. But when its all said and done, its a wonderfully crafted film that true film lovers will appreciate.",1467676800,4,2705,4.550308008213553
7758822,4,B01G71NN3Q,"First, I'm not saying you should go watch the movie. This movie is the definition of let's never tell anyone we watched this. It sounds like faint praise but it has more to do with honestly the rather prudish and frankly culturally tyrannical time we live in where all someone has to do is yell that's not whatever enough (choose a poison feminist, progressive, etc) and a band wagon will pile on without even thinking. So keep that in mind.

The movie is a brave one to show up in. A movie all about the nastiness of the entertainment industry disguised as a film about the modelling world complete with a Tom Ford look a like who has a mustache, which it's his clear evil twin. Elle Fanning does a good job of being the focus of attention. A deer in the head lights who stays a deer in the head lights even when made up to look the part of a predator. She's new to the modelling world and everything is coming so quickly to her that an equally unreasonable counter action is demanded by movie logic. It leads to the unsettling moments of the film that include a scene of wretch inducing necrophilia.

It's really the biggest issue with the movie. It's not anti-anything really outside of people being selfish, which is a running theme of the film. It's mostly trying to provoke a reaction through drama or gruelingly thought out moments of aberrant behavior. The thing is those scenes outside of honestly the overlong necrophilia scene build. I normally am on board for even the more out there stuff Mr. Refn brings into his film. The necrophilia didn't bother me as much as long as he drew it out. I get the metaphor he was going for but it was dragged out too much visually. The other ideas work better. In particular, the run up to the end is particularly effective.

The thing is that the movie seems to be taking a shot at art films in general. The beauty is everything speech midway through the movie is half a joke and half an artistic statement. Refn is taking art house film techniques and applying it to the subject matter of B-grade films. Basically, he's undermining the concept. He's been seemingly working towards this since he made Vahalla Rising. It's interesting to watch him grow as an artist. I doubt he'll be making movies like this either in 5 years. I don't see him stagnating like Tarantino.

The music, cinematography, editing, actors, and camera work are top notch as always. There's an interesting strobe effect created with editing out frames at the beginning of the film that is utterly brilliant in it's timing and beats. The music by Cliff Martinez hits the right tone consistently. It keeps the mood just right. The actors keep you engaged. I should say actresses but there's both genders in the film and probably a few inbetweeners knowing Refn's taste in pranks. They all do a good job of keeping you watching while doing horrible things. Oh and Keanu Reeves is the best low class version of a Vladimir Nabokov predator ever. I'm glad he's discovered yelling as an actor.

It's a good movie that's not for everyone because it's the most uncompromising thing that's been released since Jonathan Glazer's Under the Skin. In a sense, it makes it closer to the art films he's skewering. It certainly provoked more out of me than the boredom I feel during a Von Trier, Innaratu, or Noe movie and that's mostly cause Mr Refn has a clear sense of morality unlike those men. I've been a little sarcastic and jokey but the film is good. Just extremely graphic in it's desire to provoke the audience.",1467590400,13,3525,4.580031695721078

The Neon Demon is a beautiful, surreal film from Nicolas Winding Refn. Every piece of set, clothing, makeup, and lighting is carefully designed and oftentimes surreal. The film is a feast for the eyes, finding beauty in the mundane as well as in the high fashion world of modelling. The real world scenes tend to move the plot forward and the eerily beautiful fashion scenes slow the film to showcase the gorgeous images. The fashion plateaux are sometimes completely still until we see the full scene and then the action starts up. The pace is deliberate and slow. The sparse dialogue and basic story allow the visuals to take precedence. Along with the visuals, the music also plays a significant role. The opening credits of the film feature neon colors and Cliff Martinez's synthetic 80's inspired score. It's very effective in setting the tone of the film.

Jesse, a fresh faced southern girl, comes to LA alone with big dreams. She immediately books job after job with photographers and designers, much to the chagrin of more experienced models. Her wide eyed, innocent look along with her striking beauty cause others to be attracted to her, jealous of her, or inspired by her. Elle Fanning portrays Jesse as vapid, without much personality, but it works since others project their own wants and emotions onto her. Her journey through the film is her transformation from innocent ingenue to self aware powerhouse. Early on, her power is symbolized by a cougar breaks into her room. She fears it at first, but that changes over the course of the film. At the beginning, she relies on agents, photographers, and designers to validate her talents and beauty until she's chosen to close the show of a famous designer. She realizes that their desire and envy of her looks can be used to her advantage. This transformation is symbolized with a lengthy scene of Jesse in the finale gown faced with a trio of blue upside down triangles. At first, she looks scared and meek, but then they turn red. Her entire demeanor changes. Her eyes take on a cunning light and she presents herself as more sexual. She realizes she has all the power in this situation and recognizes her capacity for greatness.

Unfortunately, Jesse never gets to take advantage of that power. At every turn, various men in positions of power have the opportunity to exploit or abuse her. These situations are teased over and over, but never come to fruition. The photographers and designers are inspired by her, but treat her decently. Keanu Reeves as the motel manager also seemed creepy and definitely had anger issues, but he just wanted to run his motel and say rude things to people. The real danger comes from the women around her. Ruby is the first person Jesse meets in LA and they become fast friends. However, when Ruby tries to force herself on Jesse and is soundly rejected, she joins forces with the other two models who hate Jesse: Gigi and Sarah. Both of them were rejected and humiliated by industry professionals while being compared to Jesse, which is even more insulting because they all look very similar: blonde, fair skin, and blue eyes. (Even in the marketing, I mistook the other actresses for Elle Fanning.) Although they were quick to blatantly show their animosity, I didn't recognize them as a true threat maybe because their behavior is expected or my own unconscious sexism. This shows how the young women in the fashion industry aren't only under threat of those in power, but those that could benefit from their fall and those who can't stand becoming obsolete over newcomers.

The last part of the film is where the true horror is. One particular scene had people walking out, which is graphic and disturbing. While I thought it was largely unnecessary, we see how lonely Ruby is and how unhinged she is at that point. Right when Jesse is at the apex of her journey, the other girls attack her and consume her, showing physically the much less violent actions of those trying to stay relevant in looks based industries. I'm disappointed this was done offscreen. We see the aftermath as they are all washing off the blood. With Ruby, it comes off as an Elizabeth Bathory bath, but with Gigi and Sarah, it seems more like a bad softcore porn scene with blood added. The next day, Gigi and Sarah go to a photoshoot where they are treated just like Jesse. This is a hint of supernatural as they absorbed Jesse's magnetism and power by consuming her. Sarah thrives and revels in the attention while Gigi can't handle it. Gigi's meltdown scene is darkly humorous and disgusting, but shows how not all can stomach the cutthroat nature of the fashion industry. Ruby, on the other hand, cleans up the mess, digs a grave, and then menstruates everywhere? This baffling scene could mean anything. My inner reading says she does this to women periodically over the years in order to stay young and beautiful since she had the Elizabeth Bathory imagery earlier in the film. It also meshes with the overall theme of the fashion industry as a machine that uses and abuses women, pitting them against each other for supremacy.

The Neon Demon is a visually gorgeous film that moves slowly and methodically. It has shades of Black Swan, Suspiria, and Starry Eyes but stays wholly unique. Refn's singular style sets it apart and all of the performances are dedicated no matter how crazy or subdued the actions are. It's not a perfect film as some aspects are slightly disappointing. However, The Neon Demon is one of the most unique films in theaters. It pushes boundaries and frankly won't sit well with mainstream audiences with its slow pace and extreme ending. I recommend seeing it in theaters, especially if you want to see more out of the box horror in the future.",1467417600,12,5769,4.765

7758825,3,B01G71NN3Q,"Theatrical review.  Possible spoilers. My patience is running short with director/writer Nicolas Winding Refn.  The first movie I saw of his was Drive which was my favorite of 2011.  Ive seen it probably 4 times now and still love it.  So then I went back to his film from 2009, Valhalla which moved like a glacier and left me cold.  Then it was Only God Forgives from 2013 which was all style and little else.  So here is Refns latest effort about pencil-thin models trying to make it in Hollywood.

Elle Fanning (Trumbo) plays Jesse, who just turned 16 and claims to have no parents.  Shes beyond naive, except she knows she is beautiful.  With help from an amateur photographer, her photos entice an interview with a prominent agency headed by Roberta Hoffmann (Christina Hendricks, Drive and TVs Mad Men).  She gets her a gig with a top photographer (Desmond Harrington) and later with a top clothing designer (Alessandro Nivola) who love her fresh looks.  She tells everyone shes 19, but they all know better.

This all sparks jealousy with the older models (those over 20!), especially Gigi (Bella Heathcote, Pride and Prejudice and Zombies) and Sarah (Abbey Lee, Mad Max: Fury Road and a real model).  Jena Malone (all of The Hunger Games) plays Ruby, a makeup artist who has eyes for young Jesse.  Keanu Reeves is also on board as a creepy owner of a creepy hotel where poor Jesse is camped.  Refn tosses plenty of hand grenades at the modelling culture where a big meal is a cucumber.

As time passes, Jesse becomes more and more narcissistic and lets the girls know that she doesnt need any cosmetic surgery to make her look good.  I don't think she is trying to be intentionally mean, but she does later explain that her mother always said she was trouble.  There is plenty of surreal elements in the film including a lengthy scene of necrophilia and later a little cannibalism, so that should scare off most of you.  The film isn't without wit and wonderful visuals, both authentic and ethereal.  And then there is that great Cliff Martinez soundtrack, a regular Refn collaborator.  I cant say I liked this film much, but I cant say I hated it either.  If you have an offbeat appreciation for black humor and can stand a little perversion, sexual and otherwise, you might like the movie.  For most movie watchers, be forewarned.",1467158400,96,2340,4.681372549019608
7758826,3,B01G71NN3Q,"""The Neon Demon"" (2016 release; 117 min.) brings the story of Jesse, an aspiring model who just arrived in LA (from Georgia). As the movie opens, we see Jesse at a photo-shoot where at first it seems she is dead in a pool of blood. There Jesse befriends make-up artist Ruby, and they decide to go to a party, where they meet other up-and-coming models. ""Are you food or are you sex?"" asks one of them (referring to Jesse's preferred lipstick). It becomes clear that in this cut-throat competition that is the modeling business, Jesse, barely 16 but instructed by a potential agency to tell everyone she's 19, doesn't know what she's up against. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from Danish writer-director Nicolas Winding Refn, who blew us away with ""Drive"" and also brought the ambitious ""Only God Forgives"" (both Ryan Gosling-fronted). As was already the case with ""Only God Forgives"", here again Refn brings a movie heavy on style (and beautiful at that), but alas too light on substance. It might've helped had the characters been given some depth so that we have an emotional connection or reason to care. While the first hour is vaguely entertaining, the movie unfortunately derails badly in the second hour (I won't spoil specifically why). I simply couldn't buy into it all, and instead enjoyed the screen for the eye and ear candy that it brings. Yes, I said ear candy. Once again, Cliff Martinez, who also scored the previous 2 Refn movies, brings a mesmerizing electronic score that is one of the better aspects of the movie. Can't wait to check out the soundtrack. Ellie Fanning is okay as Jesse. Is she beautiful? Sure. Is she so stunningly beautiful with an obvious ""it"" factor that people left and right clamor for her (in the movie anyway)? I honestly don't see it, but that's just me I'm sure. Also keep an eye out for a barely recognizable Keanu Reeves, who has a small (less than 10 min.) role as the manager of the motel where Jesse is staying.

""The Neon Demon"" premiered at this year's Cannes film festival with considerable splash. The movie opened this past weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and the Tuesday early evening screening where I saw this at turned out to be a private screening, as in: I literally was the only person in the theater. I can't say that I was surprised, as this movie hasn't created any type of a buzz nor was it marketed aggressively. As you have garnered by now, this was not the best of movies, but if you liked Refn's previous movies, I'd suggest you check it out, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",1467158400,,2774,4.647657841140529
7758827,5,B01G71NN3Q,"It does my heart good to know that a movie like The Neon Demon can still get a wide release in the United States. Ill be the first to admit my tendency towards pessimism regarding the current state of our film industry, especially when it comes to true creative freedom. But the fact that I can hop in my car, take a 10 minute drive to my local Regal Cinemas, and watch a movie as uncompromising and unique as this  with Amazon Studios plastered on it, no less  gives me hope. The fact that I was one of exactly five people in the theater on opening Saturday night? Lets not talk about that part.

The film follows Jesse (Elle Fanning)  a beautiful, virginal (figuratively and literally), and possibly orphaned (the backstory is vague) 15-year-old girl who has recently moved to LA in pursuit of a career in modeling. Essentially, we watch as Jesse is slowly sucked in by the superficial glitz and glam of the industry, chewed up, and eventually swallowed whole as the film becomes increasingly bizarre and abstract.

At its core, The Neon Demon is a film about vanity; its a film about the vacuous existence that results from a single-minded obsession with appearance. Its certainly not a unique idea, but the success of the film is that it isn't just about vanity, it embodies vanity.

Many have praised the visual prowess of this film and Ill wholeheartedly echo that  it is unbelievably beautiful and easily one of the most visually striking movies I have ever seen. There is an obsessive attention to detail in every single frame: the lighting, shot composition, set design, color palate  you name it  are all finely tuned to create an incredibly sumptuous, nearly sublime visual experience.

But at the same time, the film feels incredibly empty. Much of it takes place in big, wide-open spaces sparsely populated by women who take up just about as little horizontal space as humanly possible. Many scenes  interestingly, often those with dialogue  feel extremely quiet as monotonic characters lethargically converse with intermittent moments of near-silence between each statement and response. And, of course, many of the films scenes find its characters simply gazing wordlessly at themselves and others, completely lost in the allure of their perceived beauty.

The polarized response to the film is definitely unsurprising. By its own design it feels empty, emotionless, and artificial. The characters in the film and the world they inhabit don't feel real; they are personifications of vanity  vampires who feed on beauty rather than blood. To enjoy the film isn't really to identify with its characters or connect emotionally, but to marvel at how wholly and successfully it captures the essence of superficiality and vanity. The brilliant crux of the film is that the pleasure derived from it by those like me who enjoyed it comes directly from the same deep-seated, mesmeric attraction to beauty that the characters in the film embody. Not unlike what Haneke accomplished with Funny Games (another polarizing film) and his commentary on the torture porn genre, Refn slyly exposes the audience for their moth-to-flame affinity for beauty, regardless of how superficial it may be.

However, while the main appeal of the film is certainly (and fully intentionally) the visual style, there definitely is subtlety and depth to the proceedings which bolster it as well. Jesses character arc is quite frank  at the outset shes a nave, relatively unassuming and hesitant girl who is slowly consumed by the glitz of the industry and ultimately becomes as self-absorbed and delusional as the veteran models who surround her. Its the manner in which this transformation occurs, however, that is quite well-executed and subtle: flattery. Shes surrounded by people in LA who universally faun over her, call her special, tell her she will be the next big thing, etc. Through a series of ever-so-subtle positive reactions to this repeated flattery (portrayed very well by Fanning), we watch as all of the praise and attention infiltrates and corrupts Jesses mind, culminating in a hallucinatory, abstract turning point during a runway show where she becomes fully taken by lust for her own beauty, kissing her reflection on either side of a triangular mirror. She becomes her own worst enemy. Though obviously taken to an extreme in the film, this is a trajectory we see all the time with child stars whose fame inflates their ego to a breaking point from which they spiral downward. And Fannings performance combined with Refns direction deftly captures the subtlety of such a transition and how it can be provoked by something as innocent as a compliment.

Also, while many of the characters  particularly the rival models  are thinly drawn (and intentionally so), I found the other main character of the film, Ruby (Jena Malone) to be quite interesting as well. Shes a makeup artist  most likely a failed model  who rubs elbows with the elite models of the industry but is clearly an outsider and fully aware of that fact. Shes pretty, and clearly just as preoccupied with beauty as the rest, but also painfully aware that she just doesnt quite have the looks to make it in the industry. So instead she does the makeup, surrounding herself with her more beautiful counterparts motivated both by envy and physical attraction. She gets as close to the life as she possibly can without being able to live it herself. This theme is very effectively driven home by her role as a house sitter later on in the movie  caretaking in the home of a wealthier, more successful individual, watering the plants, living the life but at the same time not living it at all. Its all a fantasy fueled by her desire to be something that she just isnt. Her character feels like a vehicle for commentary on the detrimental effects of a society so hyper-focused on appearance  those who don't meet the standard almost inevitably feel discluded and inadequate.

As far as criticism goes, the themes of the film can definitely be a bit heavy-handed at times. Also, on an initial viewing I will say that the third act of the film left me wanting a bit more. Looking back on the full arc I do appreciate the ending, but there was definitely a bit of a tonal shift where the film began to feel a little cartoony, particularly in the very final scenes. Its a minor criticism, as the film certainly is already quite detached from reality and the cartoony elements really just augment this quality and bring it out in full view at the close. Still, I couldn't help but want a little more as the credits started to roll (although, to be fair, its also partially because I didn't want to the film to end).

Bravo to Amazon for helping to produce this film. This was the very first film I have seen with Amazon Studios labeled on the front, and I applaud them for putting their name on a project so uncompromisingly artistic and with very little universal appeal. Regardless of whether you enjoyed the film, I think we can agree that such a huge company supporting and advertising an auteur film like this is a huge win for film lovers.

This is shot in the most beautiful way possible.
The soundtrack is hypnotizing.

7758829,1,B01G71NN3Q,"Stylish but empty-headed garbage is only sort of a horror film, like Nicolas Winding Refn's Only God Forgives was only sort of a crime film. Whether Neon Demon is actually an improvement on that train wreck is a toss-up, but at this point I'm starting to believe that Refn doesn't have another Drive in him and that he is more satisfied with pointless provocation (Necrophilia! Cannibalism!) than in entertaining his audience or telling a coherent story. This movie about a seemingly innocent model corrupted and eventually eaten up by the LA Fashion Scene doesn't develop any of its ideas beyond a couple of scenes, attempts to find a dark side to star Elle Fanning that might not actually exist, makes little to no narrative sense, seems to have nothing to say, offers no suspense or thrills, provides no reason to care about the film's heroine beyond the fact that she's played by the normally reliable Elle Fanning, and is such a monumental waste of time I was seriously tempted to ask for a refund.

The only thing that actually does work in this fiasco is Keneau Reeves, who makes the most of his very small handful of scenes as a sleazy hotel proprietor.  Reeves is not only believable, he's both scary and funny, which is more than can be said for anyone or anything else in Neon Demon.  Elle Fanning seems weirdly miscast.  She's never exhibited much of a dark side in the past and, while pretty, wouldn't seem to have the kind of looks that would set the fashion world on fire, despite every character in the movie acting as if she were the most beautiful thing in whatever room she happens to be standing.  Fanning's performance is also timid in one very obvious respect--if ever a part actually required nudity this is it, but Fanning isn't willing to go further than strip down to her underwear, which makes her two big erotic scenes stand out for their restraint in a movie that otherwise has absolutely none.  Jena Malone, for instance, not only bares all--she has sex with a corpse in a scene that doesn't exactly give Nekromantic a run for its money but is still likely to send squeamish viewers running for the exits.

Some professional reviewers that have actually liked The Neon Demon have compared it to Dario Argento's Suspiria, but I don't think that's fair to Argento or to fans of that horror film.  Yes, Suspiria is about style over story and yes it features a similarly striking use of color that is one of  Nicolas Winding Refn's trademarks, but Dario Argento knew exactly what he wanted--which was to scare the pants off his audience and make the ultimate surreal horror film.  The Neon Demon never even comes close to working as a horror movie, surreal or otherwise, and beyond the obvious (Beauty is only skin deep...literally) it's hard to tell what Refn is trying to convey with his film or, indeed, if he has anything beyond colorful neon imagery on his mind at all.

The Neon Demon is a genuinely depressing experience because it wastes a lot of potential, badly misuses star Elle Fanning and suggests that Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive might have been a one-off never to be repeated fluke.  Some people who are enamored of Refn's visual style will undoubtedly be impressed with Neon Demon (if you actually liked Only God Forgives it's probably a forgone conclusion that this movie is for you as well), but casual fans expecting a horror movie will likely find themselves bored, disgusted or both.",1466812800,3,3431,4.728643216080402
7758830,2,B01G71NN3Q,"As a viewer who has enjoyed a handful of Nicolas Winding Refn's works like Drive, Bronson, Valhalla Rising, and even Only God Forgives - which I defended wholeheartedly in a 2013 Amazon review - it pains me a little to kick off my review with the following statement: It is difficult to decide what I dislike most about Nicolas Winding Refn's The Neon Demon. Critics giving Demon positive reviews and arguing that its monomaniacal focus on style is intentionally on par with the film's message are missing the reality that NWR's creative juices are simply dried up at the moment.

So what is the least admirable trait of Refn's latest? Is it the paucity original thought? The onslaught of the routinely neon-drenched Kubrickian imagery? The fact that a good sixth of the movie feels like the director got away with making fetish porn with an Amazon Studios (and about a half dozen other production companies) budget? I'm not even going to start in on the film's literal blood baths, but I think that the lack of originality is probably the worst part.

Audiences have already seen everything that The Neon Demon has to offer. Cinematically speaking, there is nothing more than the usual slew of rehashed Kubrick frames (including a groan-worthy Shining shout out within the first few minutes). Aside from a memorable strobe-light inspired scene of a performance at a model-populated L.A. party, Refn adds nothing new to his aesthetic arsenal that he has not already splashed on the screen with his previous four films.

From a narrative standpoint, one should not expect a fully-formed, fleshed out story or characters. These are not Refn's preoccupations when making a movie, and there's nothing inherently wrong with that. That is, if the film's style and themes can compensate. Stylistically (see paragraph above), it does not hold any substantial weight. Unfortunately, there is even more of a thematic drought.

At one point in the film, the increasingly narcissistic protagonist Jesse (Elle Fanning) says that other girls will cut, carve, inject, and do anything else to their own bodies just so that they can look like a second-rate version of her. The girl from the small town who seemed so nice starts becoming a bit conceited by her time in the fashion industry. Can you believe it? Imagine that! Wow, what is the director trying to say about fashion? Hollywood? The male gaze? SOCIETY?

If there is one thing that 2016 films like The Neon Demon and Zoolander 2 should be teaching would-be blockbuster directors and arthouse auteurs alike, it is that the fashion industry has become one of the stalest targets for satire in any artistic medium or genre. It's not that superficiality doesn't deserve it, but at this point if a writer or a director has nothing original to say about it, then they should not be saying anything all.

To be fair, the trite and shiny cloud of unoriginality that is The Neon Demon does have its silver linings. I have never felt so badly for a film score than I do for Cliff Martinez's excellent work on this soundtrack. While the message of the movie will blend in with the mental smoothie of other Hollywood/superficiality parable flicks, I will not easily be able to excise Martinez's thumping synths from my ears. I will also never forget the intensity of Abbey Lee's stares.

There are also less silvery scenes involving Jena Malone taking the tired psycho lesbian trope to whole new level and an absurdly Nicolas Cage-esque Keanu Reeves as an acrimonious motel manager that I will not forget for other reasons (primarily the random shock-less ""shock value"" senselessness of them). I wish I could recommend The Neon Demon as a startlingly original work from a gifted auteur, but it feels like Refn simply isn't challenging himself or the audience in any meaningful way. Here's hoping that this kind of trite and shiny would-be shock fest will not be the only thing that Refn has to offer cinema in the future.

But if do entertain watching weird off the wall erotic art films with taboo subjects, then this film is for you and only you.
I don't think you can watch it with someone unless they are someone you can be weird with and them expose their weirdness to you.
