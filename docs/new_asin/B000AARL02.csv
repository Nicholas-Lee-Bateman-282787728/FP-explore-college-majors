8077305,5,B000AARL02,"While this may have the tenchi trademark name this anime does not involve tench at all. instead it involves a young man by the name of seyana(don't know if I spelled that right) who joins the galaxy police involuntarily, parents force him into going so that his horrible luck leaves them alone. Yes seyna has horrible luck, murphy's law follows our poor protaganist everywhere he goes one example  is when he falls through a random panel in the floor and gets electricuted while causing a ship to fall knocking a tank of water over covering the chief of the galaxy police. If you think thats humorous there are many other jokes abound. Its worth the money.",1249084800,,656,4.655172413793103
8077306,4,B000AARL02,"The story is great and the characters are great but the animation is sloppy and that's the only thing thats really wrong with it. It starts out with very good animation but then by the end of the first episode it starts to look very dry and colorless and this happens in almost every episode. Everything else is perfect but the animation is most likely is going to bother you.

Seina is unlucky, so unlucky that when he stumbles upon a recruiter looking for his senpai Tenchi he gets taken instead. He's then forced into the Galaxy police but it takes him some time before he can stop being so scared. His luck starts changing as he stops having everything that can possibly go wrong happen to him. He is assigned his own decoy to draw out pirates. His luck brings him into the lives of four women who have a habit of cancelling out his bad luck and turning it into good.

They pilot the most powerful ships in the Tenchi Universe to defeat the Barta pirates. Now the only uncertainty is whether the sexy Kanak, a former model turned GXP officer, sturdy Kiriko, who has known Seina for years, the mysterious Ryoko, a former pirate named after the legendary one, or the childish Neiju, a powerful witch, will win Seina.",1137542400,,1218,4.481981981981982
8077307,5,B000AARL02,"If your a Tenchi fan then you know that he had two girls fighting over him; and about three more that had a sexual interest in him, I think! However, they only used a dash of sexuality in their humor. It works, it works very well! However, they only had one very sexy girl! Royoko! (I'm not sure how to spell her mane, sorry) But, this time they have three (two if your not into very alien girls) and they are ... how should I say more robust! (I wonder why the artist would do something like that) Anyway, these three very sexy girls have a thing for our new hero, Seina who I think looks very much like ""Tenchi."" Unforuntately, for this new guy, he has super bad .... I mean, mega super bad luck! This bad luck is shown in the first five minutes in eps one. In huge doses too! Luckily, his good luck shows up from time to time too. Sadly, this side of his luck shows up with less frequency then his bad luck but it is there. That is how he gets in the Gx. P.O (Galaxy Police Orgainiztion) and how he captures all the pirates in eps two/three. The obvious reason for this character to have bad luck is so the writers can have a reason to put in a lot of chaos/action in various places where there should be no action at all! Moreover, having older, 20 year older age like woman is so we the fans, can have fanservice! I mean, when I was fiffteen, 20 year old girls were only interested in me in my dreams but I'm an otakou [or some craziness like that : )] However, with all this upserdness it only makes this particular piece of anime very good! If you loved Tenchi, then you will uber-love this, buy it!",1135900800,2,1606,4.134185303514377
