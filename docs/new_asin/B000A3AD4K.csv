.
EVERYBODY WINS is a so-so drama set in a working class area of Connecticut. Based on Arthur Miller's one-act stage drama ""Some Kind of Love Story,"" this was his first screenplay since ""The Misfits.""

It's only for Nolte and/or Winger fans, or maybe homesick ex-Nutmeggers (like me). Even then this one's a slog.

(5.1) Everybody Wins (1990) - Nick Nolte/Debra Winger/Will Patton/Judith Ivey/Kathleen Wilhoite/Jack Warden",1374105600,,622,5.068627450980392
8073869,5,B000A3AD4K,"While Leon Redbone sings ""I Want to be Seduced"", Nick Nolte drives through town looking as if he's lackadaisically thinking the same thing.  Right from the outset, Everybody Wins plays satirical games with the conventions of film noir.  Shouldn't even the hero's name, Tom O'Toole, tip us off that we're in for something a little different?  What may strike some people as disjointed about this picture is that it uses disjunction by giving us sunlit noir.  The evil lurking in the shadows of Tom's inability to get with the program is perfectly commonplace.  Even bad-girl Angela's double-dealing doesn't fool anyone but him.  (Thanks to Debra Winger's fully engaged performance--to put it mildly--we can't fault him for succumbing.)  While he devotes himself to trying to uncover what everybody else already knows, nobody runs around trying to kill him or bumping off witnesses.  Why bother?  The tackiness of the evidence that put the wrong man in jail for murder (some teeth from his comb) points itself up as almost a prosecutor's afterthought, a formality where proof would've been superfluous anyway.  (It recalls Marcel Dalio's little face-saving speech at the end of The Rules of the Game, when he dismisses a murder as ""only a terrible accident, that's all."")  Most of the film noir devices we may keep expecting never show up; but the joke of this picture's teasing relationship with them is how antiquated and silly and inadequate to the situation they'd look if they did.

The studio's decision to market Everybody Wins as a thriller probably didn't help it with audiences.  It's not a movie for people who expect movies to do all their thinking for them.  In terms of subtlety and sly wit, it's much closer to the first half of Kubrick's Lolita than to film noir.  Film noir says that nihilism is really all that's left.  Everybody Wins, which ends with a big celebration that only Tom O'Toole walks out on, says, satirically, that once you give in to nihilism, it's party time in the madhouse.

Anyone expecting a genre piece will probably agree with this movie's terrible reviews.  It deserved better.  It has its own sustained way of seeing, and provides the pleasures of the completely unexpected.",1355270400,6,2215,4.953929539295393

8073871,5,B000A3AD4K,"Although I can see some cinemographic limitations with this movie, I was riveted throughout. To me, the psychology was perfect. Nolte was an investigator with great listening skills. He knows how to make friends with people, even when they are nuts. Winger is a borderline multiple personality disorder person who has a way of evading truth. I've known people like this...too many. All her evasions come from the fact that she actually was an accessory to the murder that she hires Nolte to study, ostensibly to help get a man freed who has been falsely convicted of the crime. The intricacies are too much for this forum, but at the end, Nolte succeeds in getting off the falsely accused man, but this so-called 'good act' actually is a laugh. Why? Because if the case were properly aired, the corruption of all the county's leaders would be uncovered, and the woman who hired Nolte would herself be up for a stiff prison sentence. So a good deed is done, but a mountain of guilt and corruption is left untouched. To me, that's the way it really is in life even though most do not discuss it.",1293753600,2,1093,4.61025641025641
8073872,3,B000A3AD4K,"I really wanted to and really thought I was gonna love this one. It had some really great credits, and I settled in for a good mystery. It was written by Arthur Miller, starring Debra Winger, Nick Nolte, Jack Warden and Will Patton. But alas, The sparks just did not fly.

Here's the story...Tom O'Toole(Nolte) is private eye, who at first appearance, you might take him for a young Columbo, but Columbo he is not. He takes on a case from the beautiful and charming Angela Crispini(Winger), who claims to have information that could free a man unjustly convicted of murder. Angela wraps Tom around her little finger; she throws him little bits of information about the case, implying that not only do they have the wrong guy, but there are corrupt politians who are involved as well. She says cryptically, ""This case goes all the way to the top of the mountain."" She seduces him till he can't think straight. Angela's got a little bit of a personality problem, the problem is she's got three of them(personalities). Tom is never really sure who he is dealing with.

As Tom digs futher into the case he must deal with the most taxing array of lunatics, all living in the same town. The main suspect, Jerry(Patton),is an ex-drug runner turned religous fanatic, and he is surrounded by a wild group of bikers who worship a dead civil war hero. There's Angela's ex - the D.A. that worked the case originally, and the Judge that would like to know Angela better.

Okay stop laughing, this is not a comedy(At least I don't think it was).
Although the story seemed a little far fetched, there are a few good points that are worth the view. The story had lots of twists and turns, and was not totaly predictable. The actors performances were good. I must admit Debra Winger did a good job portraying mulitple personalities; Nolte, as the in the dark detective, and Patton as a psychotic also gave fine performances. I really liked the soundtrack, mostly by Leon Redbone.

So you might want to give this one a try, espcially if you are a fan of modern noir, Arthur Miller, or any of these actors, just to get a taste of something a little different.
