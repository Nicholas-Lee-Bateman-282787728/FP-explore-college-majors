Who would have thought of Will Smith as James West?  Well, he pulls it off with aplomb.  The interaction between the characters was awesome!  Kevin Kline is a hoot!  This movie was just plain fun!",1235174400,2,463,4.27906976744186
3101332,1,B00132D7VI,"I'm not reviewing the quality of these movies because they are great films, but the quality of the dvd itself.  The dvd box claims a widescreen format for both movies.  That is simply not true. When inserted into a dvd player, Maverick is the fullscreen version of the film, and therefore is insufficient for anyone with a widescreen tv.  I'd swear they took this dvd straight from the VHS! The picture is grainy and blurry and makes it look like the film was made in 1950 instead of 1994! I've watched movies on youtube that look better.  Great movies, but horrible dvd. Here's hoping they make a blu ray using the original source film.",1232150400,15,637,4.56140350877193

This seems to be a manufacturing error, that was clearanced because of the defect.  Once on the secondary market, the defective DVDs are sold as a ""good"" item because the UPC is the same. I am sure there is good product available, both movies widescreen as described, but I don't know how to distinguish it from the mis-labeled products.

3101349,4,B00132D7VI,"In perusing the DVD bargain rack at a nearby Ross Store, I discovered a western comedy Double Feature disc including ""Maverick"" and ""Wild Wild West."" I bought the disc for Maverick. The two movies come on one disc, one on one side and one on the other. No problem, but it takes a bit of care in handling the disc.

The movies are western comedies but couldn't be much more different. I watched ""Maverick"" first because it was a favorite story (both movie and TV) from the past. As you might expect, ""Maverick"" was a droll, tongue-in-cheek type of comedy that was consistently funny throughout and a very amusing movie to watch. ""Wild Wild West"" was a different story. Whether you like this one or not will depend in part on exactly what you are expecting. A good story line? No. Good acting? Not particularly. Good photography? It's okay. I'd have to say the whole movie is totally absurd and parts of it are actually funny. Do you like elaborate gadgets? You'll love the movie. The gadgets and mechanical tricks are a comedy in themselves and very humorous to watch. ""Wild Wild West"" is kinda a semi-worthwhile film and the value would depend on your own tastes. As a Double Feature packet, I'd say the disc is worthwhile.
