559996,4,6303072720,"""The Burning Hills"" is one of those Warner Brothers, made in Cinemascope with my all time favorite male actor Tab Hunter.

His female partner in this western is Natalie Wood who became famous ""Rebel Without a Cause"" and immortal in the movie history as Maria in ""West Side Story"".

Co-Stars are: Earl Holliman, Claude Akins, Ray Teal, Skip Homeier - (each of those appearing also in ""Bonanza"").

DVD:

Still none subtitles available o this Warner Brother Archive Collections.
The Picture Quality is ok/acceptable. Contains some damages and it could be sharper.

Fazit: thrilling western, with very good actors...definitive a MUST have for Tab Hunter Fans",1322697600,7,654,5.190476190476191

THE ENTIRE MOVIE IS FASCINATING FROM BEGINNING TO THE THRILLING END! TAB HUNTER AND NATALIE WOOD'S PERFORMANCES WERE ''OSCAR'' WORTHY...JUST A TERRIFIC 1950's WARNER BROS. FILM !",1315958400,2,304,5.224489795918367
559998,3,6303072720,"Having Natalie Wood and Tab Hunter star in this movie represents the thinking of another time, 1956, a time when Hollywood cast actors who were popular in films based only on that popularity whether they were suited for the roles in the movie or not.

This film used to show frequently on the TNT afternoon Western Theatre at 4:00pm.  Though it is an 'ok' western for those of us western fans, it comes up far short of the realism of the book.  Louis L'Amour's book of the the same name, THE BURNING HILLS, is of due course much more in depth and also much better.  I've been watching ENCORE westerns for the last couple years and do not recall seeing this film play.  While it doesn't deserve to be fully forgotten its appearance anytime soon on DVD may be unlikely.

If it comes your way you may want to take 92 minutes and watch, it is at least a 3-star venture.

Best in westerns, pard.

So it is with a heavy heart that I say that Natalie Wood who is always a favorite seemed and sounded so forced. The accent, Mexican, was awful. And while Most of the movie seemed to be centered on her, it was okay, just wish she could have been Canadian and not trying that bad accent. However, I do recommend this movie very highly.",1441324800,,508,4.09

560114,4,6303072720,"Western author Louis L'Amour was so prolific and his books were so good that Hollywood didn't have to think twice about adapting his stuff to the silver screen. And there is a grip of solid cinematic treatments, with the best received either 1953's HONDO with John Wayne or the 1979 teleplay THE SACKETTS. I put THE BURNING HILLS just below that tier. I liked it that much. It's probably my favorite Tab Hunter flick.

One chain-smokes cheroots. One has a limp. One flashes fancy Mexican spurs. When Trace Jordan (Hunter) rides his beat-up red horse into Esperanza, he's not looking to tour the town. Trace Jordan is hell bent on get-back for the murder of his brother, Johnny. He's on the lookout for three killers. He makes a beeline for Old Man Sutton, the reprehensible cattle baron who's been disrupting the homesteading of them settlers, of which Trace's brother was one. The baron means to possess the entirety of the valley before the official recertification of the settlers' deeds. Trace accuses Sutton of dispatching his men to kill his brother. When a man calls out another, no one should be surprised when pistols start clearing leather. Trace catches a bullet.

During the heyday of the Hollywood studio system, back when the truth could be better obfuscated and the suits exerted supreme influence, powerhouse film studios made a habit of pairing up this leading man with that leading lady and passing them off as a real-life romantic couple, and then look at the box office soar. Man, the public used to soak in those publicity stills. In the mid-1950s, Warner Brothers had a notion of promoting teen heartthrobs Tab Hunter and Natalie Wood as sweethearts. But for whatever reason Hunter and Wood co-starred only in two films, 1956's THE BURNING HILLS and THE GIRL HE LEFT BEHIND later on that same year. But nothing much came of this collaboration. And so ended that matchmaking experiment.

THE BURNING HILLS is packed with thrills and also with helpful tips on how to outfox a posse hot on your heels. Watch Trace Jordan closely. Should you find yourself in the burning hills and facing a similar peril, then you, too, can stay one step ahead by applying torn bits of petticoat to the horse's hooves to cover its tracks. Or by yanking a post to collapse a mine tunnel. Or by luring the pursuers into a Comanche camp.

Heading for the Army post at Stockwell, the wounded Trace meets the fiery half-breed, Maria Christina Colton (Wood), and is reluctantly nursed by her and then aided by her in his flight to Fort Stockwell. Wood, at this stage, is well on her way to transitioning from cute child star to accomplished adult actress. So my jaw didn't drop when she outacts and outsmolders Hunter in every scene they share. Oh, those flashing eyes! Her Mexican accent falters here and there, but I'm convinced her spitfire performance here contributed to her later landing the part of ""Maria"" in WEST SIDE STORY. Tab Hunter, for his part, makes a credible and vigorous man of action. Since a Louis L'Amour novel provides the source material, the plot snarls and is lean and mean and no-nonsense. No unnecessary exposition or introspection here. Glenn Ford, his best pensive face on, would be utterly lost and useless in this movie. Skip Homeier invites death glares and hisses as Sutton's sadistic son, Jack. Claude Akins lends grounding as Old Man Sutton's level-headed foreman trying to keep Jack in check. Eduard Franz adds color as the neutral Indian tracker. And now I'm reminded of a cheesy joke:

- Man in the Old West making conversation with a grizzled frontiersman: ""So, mister, what do you do?""
- Frontiersman, boasting: ""I'm a mean old Indian fighter.""
- First man: ""And is that your wife there?""
- Frontiersman: ""Yes. She's the mean old Indian.""",1376352000,,3774,4.817901234567901
