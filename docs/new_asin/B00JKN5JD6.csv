6373269,3,B00JKN5JD6,"WOW, look I would just have to go straight to the Side Bar on this one. The writing threw everything off! The lines were totally unbelievable as well as unrealistic. What? Not even in a fantasy world would anyone do some of the thing the characters did when engaging the attackers when they had the upper hand. Perhaps it was suppose to be that way for entertainment purpose then perhaps it would sell. I kept telling my self its going to get better[the lines that is], but they didn't. I could have enjoyed this even as a silent movie. The action was there...the thrill was there casting was okay, but the lines killed it for me! Straight from the Side Bar. Its okay.",1405036800,,668,4.439024390243903
6373270,4,B00JKN5JD6,I liked this movie although shorter than most. Storyline was fairly well played out.  People trying to get out of a bad situation as usual. Actors were good in their parts even if they were unknowns. Was different from the Vacancy that we all know with killers somewhat having a motive for what they are doing. Overall is a good movie to sit & watch for the 80 odd minutes of running time.,1404777600,,389,4.328767123287672

6373273,2,B00JKN5JD6,"Lionsgate is behind this.... Man, what has become of American horror. (Hangs her head down in shame.) Not a fresh idea emerged in this film. Not any style, or intuition or real creativity/imagination. Even 1 kill method was used twice in this flick. Rarely have I given less than 3 to a well produced film, but that didn't even work in its favor, as a less polished, grainy look would've given it a more naturalistic feel. That might've helped and man, is help sorely needed. Well produced does not mean well made. The script made me feel like it was going to break out as a spoof any minute but it didn't. The dialogue was laughable at times. So far as the characters go, I wound up watching for the protags to be slaughtered. A more deserving bunch have rarely graced a horror film. Won't say if I was satisfied or not but after you see it, you will know. The female antags were a total waste. They looked like porn stars and had as much to do as them. The only remotely interesting character was the leader, though his time was brief. Interestingly, I thought he had the look of a porn producer. Surely, the cast could find work in that industry if this one doesn't pan out. The other 2 out of 3 males were blanks, much like the girls. The end was totally inconsistent with what came before it, not in terms of the 'bodies' but what was the point of it all then? They just took over that business and nobody noticed?  I can't say more due to not wanting to spoil anything for anyone. I was heavily disappointed at what came before that though. It should never and could never have gone that way.  The only thing they got kinda right was the gore in a couple of kills.  Overall, what a waste.",1404432000,12,1694,4.320754716981132
6373274,4,B00JKN5JD6,"This movie was very meaty and amusing fo sho!! I personally thought it was just as good as the Luke Wilson Vacancy movie from a few years back, as this movie put a few gory highlights taken from other movies and put into one movie, and put a twist on the story, and made it all work!!!! The actors/actresses did a great job, and the filming quality was good!! All around great rental fo sho!!!!",1404345600,4,394,4.266666666666667

6373276,3,B00JKN5JD6,"I would have given this another star had I felt it wasn't so rushed at a running time of only 81 minutes. The story wasn't anything amazing but the action was well paced and there was some decent gore and the effects were cleverly done for the budget.

I found the acting to be above par for this caliber of film and I really got into it. Its really nothing we haven't seen before but I'm a sucker for a straight up slasher with no ghosts or paranormal aspects .Just give me a group of semi stupid kids and someone or something attacking them with sharp objects or in this case they get a bit more creative in the kill department.

Think something along the lines of it ""wanting"" to be Vacancy 2 meets The devils rejects
If you need a slasher fix and don't mind a short running time check it out.",1404172800,,796,4.196078431372549
6373277,3,B00JKN5JD6,"Dont confuse this title with the Kate Beckinsale/Luke Wilson thriller VACANCY from 2007the covers look slightly similar, but there is no relation between the two movies.  NO VACANCY, an upcoming horror film from Lionsgate, is a film about seven friends who are captured by a group of sadistic killers at a roadside motel and tortured.  And despite that simplistic description, theres more to the story than what is mentioned.  But does this movie succeed in entertaining?  I guess the answer to that question depends on what you're looking for.

The premise of this movie is sound, which is one of the reasons I wanted to like it so much.  I mean, who has not had car trouble in the middle of nowhere?  That in itself is a scary notion, but throw in some overly friendly helpers, and youve got the potential for a lot of scary situations.

Unfortunately, NO VACANCY never really seems to get off the ground.  It looks great and is shot very wellbut theres something big missing.  Instead of entertaining and thrilling, I found the film flat and, well, uninteresting for the most part.

I think a big point of dissatisfaction for me is the main characters.  They are a snotty and uppity sort, not really likable in any form.  So when bad things start to happen to them, I really didn't feel anything for them.  But they're not so bad that you want them to die.  As a result, I didn't really care one way or the other; my emotion was like Eh, whatever.

Also, the story in NO VACANCY is lacking a bit.  I liked the opening sequence, with the news report about the fire in the orphanagebut it pretty much broadcasts the big twist from the start.  From that point on, theres not a lot of tension that is built up.  Obviously, you need a bit of suspense if you want a successful horror flick.  Once again, I found myself shrugging my shoulders.

I am going to summarize my review with this:  I am simply going to recommend giving this a look for yourself to see how and if you like it.  Maybe it just caught me on an off day or somethingI don't know.  If you decide to give it a look, hop back over here and leave us a message with your thoughts.  Maybe I need to give this one a second chance; but for now, my answer is no.",1403827200,8,2219,4.379901960784314

Bunch of ""friends"" break down in the middle of nowhere, find welcoming folk at a bar/motel, get drunk, then bad things happen ... seriously bad things. If you liked Saw, if you liked Hostel, then this is for you. Heads chopped off, bodies ripped apart, bathtub electrocutions, yeah, it's all there. And a little bit of t&a thrown in for good measure.

For some reason when the survivors have a chance to escape they start acting really, really dumb, leading to a totally implausible ending. Ah well.

6373294,3,B00JKN5JD6,"The film opens with a story about 23 orphans being killed in a fire. The rest of film is us figuring out what this had to do with the rest of the film with flashbacks to ""10,000 Maniacs"" and ""House of a 1,000 Corpses."" Seven young adults taken a back road into Vegas, a too common horror film set up, and find themselves stranded at a friendly bar and motel. Then the clever killings start, 1 person at a time in a slow methodical manner. I give them a plus for that.

Dallas Lovato played the role perfected by Sherie Moon Zombie. She did a fair job, but they didn't let her go. There were a few good characters, but the rest, especially Claire (Kristen Quintrall) were mostly cardboard. The on screen horror chemistry and mood wasn't there. When Claire was attempting to hide, her continuous whimpering was more annoying than anything. Kill her, let's move on I kept thinking to myself.

Once the film did tie together to that orphan thing...""Really? That's it?""

They also had trouble with the title. The first title (used in UK) was ""The Helpers"" which actually related to the film, even though it lacks any horror factor. The US title, ""No Vacancy"" is a better horror title (We don't get a picture of little fuzzy chipmunks trying to help people) but it doesn't relate to the film other than the fact it has a motel in it, which BTW always had a vacancy. With ""Motel Hell"" already taken, the pickings are slim.

Some attempt at dark humor like ""House of a !,000 Corpses."" If you need a slasher film fix, you could do worse.

6373297,1,B00JKN5JD6,"I love horror films. If you read enough of what I write you already know this. That's why when I see a sloppy horror film that attempts to take the genre and just add another log on the fire but in the worst way possible I get upset. I sit and wonder why, with so many films that are waiting to be made, why was it this film in particular got the green light or someone to invest in it? Case in point NO VACANCY.

The movie tells the story of 7 friends on a vacation trip. These stereotypes have been done so often that you recognize them instantly. The nerd of the group is filming everything with his video camera. The male member of one couple is the bully, always picking on the nerd. The group would have been 8 had not the nerd's girlfriend bowed out at the last minute. A roadblock alters their route and suddenly they have two blowouts in the middle of nowhere. Imagine my surprise when a truck shows up and a guy gives them a lift to town.

Here comes the only new twist added to an aging genre. Spoiler alert if you care to watch this movie. They're taken to a nearby town where everyone treats them well. They get free drinks, free food and free motel rooms. But during the night they're gassed and wake to find themselves tied or imprisoned in their rooms. It turns out the entire town is involved in killing the group. Why isn't revealed until the very end but clues were given in the seemingly insignificant opening montage.

The movie falls into the genre known as torture porn with the killers less intent on killing their prey than they are in coming up with ""creative"" ways to kill them. I have yet to understand this in any movie or TV series, the whole idea that now that you have the good guy in your hands why you don't just shoot him but instead take the time to explain just why you are shooting him and instead give him a lecture about how badly you were treated as a child or some other nonsensical reason. It always allows time for them to find a way to escape.

If that wasn't enough to steer you clear of this film the ending should. It leaves it open for the possibility of a sequel even though from what you witnessed taking place there should have been no chance of that. If only.

The acting is passable with the exception of the leader of the killers who comes off as an actor portraying a role. For me that's the determining factor when I view actors. Did you make me believe you weren't acting? If not, you stink. This guy stinks. So much that I didn't want to watch who got credit for portraying that role. That was a mistake on my part because had I paid closer attention I would have known not to watch anything else he does in the future.

If you feel compelled to watch movies in the torture porn genre, if you will watch any movie at all that falls into the horror genre, then by all means give this one a watch. As for myself I think I'll let all I know that this movie isn't worth your time.",1405382400,,2935,4.2042628774422734
