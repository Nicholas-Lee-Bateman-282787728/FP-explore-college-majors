8524599,3,B0083QJVJO,"It is just over 30 years since this OVA series began, and it has stood up remarkably well, despite multiple authors, lawsuits between participants, truncated series, reboots, and no definitive ending.  That such a thing is even watchable today is amazing, that most (but not all) of it has appealed to so many different viewers over so many long years is a tribute to the genius (mostly) displayed in creating it.  You won't like all of it, for too many different directions were tried, but you will likely like most of it, and of how many things is that true?

Lets begin with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bubblegum-Crisis/dp/B0002TSZME/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bubblegum Crisis</a>&nbsp;(1987-1991), a probably intended 13 half-hour-to-hour-long episode series, cut short to just 8.  In 2032 just seven years after Tokyo was hammered by the Second Great Kanto Earthquake, a colossal corporation, Genom, is rising, unchecked by the government entities it corrupts or owns.  Its products are artificial cybernetic lifeforms that are usually in the form of humans, with most of their bodies being machines.  These wondrous inventions do great good for mankind,... when they are working properly.  When they are not working properly, by accident or design, they become a menace to life, and are subject to destruction by the largely overworked and outmatched AD Police and the Knight Sabers, an all-female group of powered exoskeleton equipped mercenaries.  Interestingly, the ultimate goal of the Knight Sabers is not to destroy Genom, against whom most members have a blood debt or two, but rather to control it by destroying only its most destructive projects, products,... and people.

The first three episodes form a loosely contrived trilogy introducing the Knight Sabers, explaining their origin, depicting their struggles, and showing their ultimate triumph over the schemes of Genom executive Brian J. Mason.  This is followed by a single episode savage road duel between an automobile driver and a motorcycle gang, then by a two-episode heartbreaker about love-dolls, apparent vampirism, and Genom corruption.  The last two episodes involve a character with a vendetta (based upon the events of an earlier episode), and a final episode focussing on Nene.

Unfortunately, now the two rights holding companies began to angrily split apart, forcing all sorts of problems.  A truncated 3 OVA episode version of the arguably intended ending of the Bubblegum Crisis series,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bubblegum-Crash/dp/B00008G6U3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bubblegum Crash</a>&nbsp;(1991), was produced, but it pales somewhat in comparison with the preceding (being a bit too silly), though it is necessary to watch for fans of the original.  An additional truncated 3 OVA prequel series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/AD-Police-Files/dp/B0002J4X3Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">AD Police Files</a>&nbsp;(1990), depicting the origin and earlier adventures of character Leon McNichol, was also produced, but it is overly downbeat and depressing, not to mention inconclusive about the fates of characters other than Leon, especially his first partner.

Next are the reboots, and as near as I can tell, no serious attempt was made to link any of these together.  The first was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bubblegum-Crisis-Tokyo-2040/dp/B00TQGGG8Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040</a>&nbsp;(1998-1999), a 24 episode TV series plus 2 OVA episodes reboot of Bubblegum Crisis and Bubblegum Crash.  Now, as a rule, I don't think much of reboots for obvious reasons: Wow, the original was brilliant, unique, nothing quite like it!  How can we achieve similar success?  I know, lets COPY it!...  (What can possibly go wrong with that, the world wonders?)  More seriously, the problem with doing this (which I don't recommend by the way; instead Id advise adding sequels to the original story) is how do you do it successfully?  Steer too close to the original, and (unless your animation really is better, which it usually isnt, especially if you are going from OVA to TV) all youve got is a copy.  Whoopee.  Steer too far away, and you risk destroying whatever appeal the original had for its audience.  For this reason IMHO most reboots aren't worth your time, but there are exceptions, and one Im thinking of involves&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Birdy-the-Mighty-Double-Trouble/dp/B00015HUUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Birdy the Mighty - Double Trouble</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Birdy-the-Mighty-Final-Force/dp/B0001KNHU4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Birdy the Mighty - Final Force</a>&nbsp;the 4 episode OVA series and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Birdy-the-Mighty-Decode/dp/B00BLQRFSM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Birdy the Mighty: Decode</a>&nbsp;the 25 episode TV series, plus 1 OVA.  At first glance, with the OVA series animated by Madhouse and the TV series NOT animated by Madhouse, it should have been no contest, but the TV series succeeds by being better written.  For one thing the main male character is less of a whiny wuss and more of a thoughtful contrast to Birdys insane recklessness.  In addition a lot more thought was put into the complications of Birdys life and universe, including the whole hilarious Birdy_pretends_to_be_a_model/idol running joke.

Similar things are going on in Bubblegum Crisis, Bubblegum Crash versus Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040.  The biggest problem with the original IMHO is that except for the 3 episode opening and the 3 episode Bubblegum Crash closing, there is no particular structure to the 5 episodes in the middle, and most of the several different creators seem to have focused on Priss, excepting the 8th episode focusing on Nene.  In contrast Sylia is largely a mystery, and Linna is largely a nonentity.  However, in Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040 all four of the main characters are more carefully plotted out and, in particular, are a lot more in conflict with each other, both over Sylias secrets from them... and problems with each other.  A number of things brought over from the original series are more carefully planned, explained, and implemented in the reboot; in particular Mackey Stingray has been significantly changed.  Finally, the multi-episode stories have no original series equivalent.  About the only criticism Id make of the reboot is that in contrast to the careful plotting of the beginning and the build up to the end, the final events of the ending seem a bit confused and rushed; however, it is noteworthy that it does make considerably more sense in the Japanese with English subtitles format.

Next, although arguably a prequel, is the 12 episode TV series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-D-Police-To-Protect-and-Serve/dp/B00005YUN0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A.D. Police: To Protect and Serve</a>&nbsp;(1999); essentially its a cop show about the adventures of a couple of mismatched partners,... REALLY mismatched partners, who just happen to serve in the A.D. Police.  On the one hand it is pretty well written, and, unlike AD Police Files, this series actually has an ending; on the other hand, it is rather poorly animated and has a fairly downbeat and depressing ending, which goes with the downbeat and depressing halfway point.  Now, if you like cop stories, you will probably like this; there is definitely some clever writing about the problems of being a cop at any time, in any situation.  However, the science fiction seems a bit underwritten.

Last is the 3 OVA episode series ""Parasite Dolls"" (2003), which is arguably another reboot since its connections with A.D. Police: To Protect and Serve (or AD Police Files for that matter) are iffy at best.  Yet Another Serious Look at the Underbelly of Tokyo/Genom City starts out pretty well, if pretty dark and grim, but the individual episode endings don't make much sense, and the final episode is so off the charts insane that it really messes up the series IMHO.

Note: Naked female breasts pop up infrequently but occasionally in many of these shows (in the OVAs) so be ye warned.
