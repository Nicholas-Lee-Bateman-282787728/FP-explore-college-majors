8071711,5,B000A0LAJA,This is the grittiest spaghetti western I have seen so far! Awesome action and Grit beyond belief. Anthony Ghidra is bad to the bone and his performance is A+++. Outstanding cast and solid revenge story. 4.75 on Grit factor. Another Wild East masterpiece!,1508630400,,255,4.953488372093023

8071714,2,B000A0LAJA,"The rechristened titled spaghetti western Pistoleros (not sure why Wild East put that title on the box art as in my research it has never been released anywhere in the world with that title) is very substandard Italian western.

The first problem is the production values as the film just looks cheap. It's also full of clich bar fight scenes, uninteresting characters, and a plot that's easily forgettable. I don't regret buying the DVD as I am a collector of spaghetti westerns but this is easily one of the worst in my collection.

The plot is simple - two men (a young bounty hunter and older man with a score to settle) are after the same man and always get their paths crossed.

Wild East does another good transfer but sadly the Print they obtained does have damage, mostly with the soundtrack. There are many moments in the film with cracks, pops and also many points when the sound drops out completely. A minor hindrance due to the print.

The picture is non-anamorphic widescreen. It's an older disc so that's forgivable. A picture gallery and trials for Anthony Ghidra films are also included",1241568000,5,1104,4.704663212435233
