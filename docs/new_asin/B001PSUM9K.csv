3761151,1,B001PSUM9K,"I bought this item in hopes it would be a similar topic like ""Grand Avenue"" and I had wanted to share this with my clients- adolescent teens in a treatment center.  After I reviewed it, I want to return it!  It was of poor quality, the acting is on a lower level and the topics are even lower.  It is an inappropriate series that involves extensive drinking and doesn't even come close to reflecting an accurate view of an Indigenous population.  If it were titled ""Coyote"", then it would have been more appropriate.  It was just a dumb series.",1295308800,4,544,4.454545454545454

3761153,1,B001PSUM9K,"I am not Native American.  I saw Dance me Outside and loved it.  I wanted to see this series when it was on in Canada but i live in the USA,  I hate this series and now I am stuck with this DVD.  Don't buy this.",1249084800,6,211,3.5217391304347827
3761154,1,B001PSUM9K,"PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!

I am Native American and I am mortified someone actually spent money on this steaming piece of manure.
The money could have gone to feeding starving children or funding ANYTHING else.
Boring characters, laughable plots and not so attractive native people just drain you and your patience.
I would say your time is better spent hitting yourself in the head with a CLAW HAMMER!",1245196800,11,415,4.845070422535211
3761155,5,B001PSUM9K,"based on 'dance me outside' the movie and play, this is a funny and depressing series.  the depressing part is the physical life on 'the rez', the funny part is the spirit of the people!  they are making the most of what little they have.  (you don't have to have seen the movie for a set-up, but why miss out on a great film?  buy it, too!)

narrated by and starring ryan black (reprising his role from the movie), he describes his life on, and struggle to get off of, 'the rez'.  he has to write a paper for a scholarship to go to school and takes us along for the ride!  from a young man who stages his own funeral, cuz it look like it will fun and wants to see it (yes, there is a funny twist at the end, but even his mother gets into the spirit of the event) to dealing with alcholism and the government, each episode is filled with laughs and tears.

i thought after all these years, i was going to have to just record it on dvd, from the copies i made off of the cbc on vhs, but i never gave up hope and looked for both the movie and the series every year.  my wish was granted!

buy this immediately, if not sooner, for a show you will watch over and over.  ENJOY!",1243468800,54,1172,3.9871244635193133

3761174,5,B001PSUM9K,"Great show and it paints a very vivid picture of how tough life can be on the rez. Anywhere from being cheated out of treaties for land, reuniting with parents, shortage of jobs *hints why welfare is most commen on Rez, protesting against Native ""Inspired"" creations intended to fool the gulabble into thinking its ""made by Indigenous peoples"", ect.

Its great to have a little something to show what situations we actually do face that most tend to turn their head away from...maybe it might gain attention to get these things addressed.",1389571200,4,538,4.8478260869565215
3761175,5,B001PSUM9K,"Although this series is old, I loved Dance Me Outside, and had to relive the characters through this offering. Two of the leading characters have changed, but even without Michael Greyeyes and Adam Beach, Ryan Black and crew manage to carry on without missing a beat.

This is a keeper!",1387411200,,286,4.72
3761176,4,B001PSUM9K,"This is one for your collection. The life on the rez, the locations are not all the same however, if you look at the soul of the native american. You will see that all are pretty much the same in the spirit of the Native American. All emotions of the ndn are there. Laughter is one of the main character of a ndn. This collection brings that to your heart. A merry heart doeth good like a medicine. Get your copy today. This a spin off of the movie, Dance Me Outside(I think).",1380412800,2,476,4.129032258064516
3761177,5,B001PSUM9K,"What a great feel this series has.  After watching it all, I was only sorry there wasn't more.  The Native American actors were very endearing.",1378166400,2,143,4.68
3761178,5,B001PSUM9K,"(Think Northern Exposure but on an Indian reservation.)  One sign of a good TV series is whether or not you actually come to care about the characters.  On that score, at least for me, this show succeeds.  ""The Rez"" is based loosely on the 1994 movie ""Dance Me Outside"" which came out about two years before the series (the movie and series are old news already, but I only learned about them in the last year).  The role of Frank Fencepost, originally played by Adam Beach, is here played by Darrell Dennis.  However, Beach joins the series for a few episodes (playing a different character) during the latter half of this short-lived show -- there were only 19 episodes.  There are some other changes too from the movie, but two of the main characters, played by Ryan Black and Jennifer Podemski, remain the same.  Okay, enough on that.  The show started off not taking itself too seriously, just a (silly) good time.  But as it progressed, some of the story-lines took on a more serious tone (without, thankfully, ever taking itself too seriously).  I think the acting was very good, particularly Ryan Black, who really shines here (but everyone was really good, just a little something extra good about Ryan).  Listen, I'm just a white guy from the city, and have no idea what it is like to live on an Indian reservation in Canada (or anywhere), so I can't speak to its authenticity, but the show certainly kept me entertained.  I not only recommend the series, but the movie, Dance Me Outside, too.  The way the series ended, I get the feeling that the writers and actors knew it was over (of course, that's just a guess on my part).  I would love to see a followup TV movie to learn what became of these characters as some of them had dreams they were pursuing.  Five stars.",1378080000,24,1780,4.553459119496855
3761179,5,B001PSUM9K,I loved the series. I'm Native American and I love this kind of movie/series. My whole family has watched it several times already.,1373500800,10,131,4.739130434782608

3761181,5,B001PSUM9K,Made me reminisce from my life on the Rez!!! A lot of good memories of that life.  Excellent movie series.,1364774400,6,106,4.3
3761182,2,B001PSUM9K,"I thought it would be more like 'Dance me Outside' but it ended up being a pretty cheesy mini-series, I didn't care for it.",1364256000,,123,4.166666666666667
3761183,5,B001PSUM9K,I'm just sorry the series ended.  Ryan Black is a talented and captivating young man.  The whole cast was amazing.  I sat and watched the whole series over Christmas weekend.  I wish there was more!,1356307200,12,198,4.571428571428571
3761184,3,B001PSUM9K,"The first few episodes seemed uniteresting and slow. Around the fourth episode the stories started to be more interesting. Too bad the series ended. It probably should have been developed more.

But for the price/value and if folks are familiar with the movie ""Dance Me Outside"", its a great way to catch up with some of the characters and their lives afterwards.",1329264000,6,363,4.854838709677419

8334648,4,B001PSUM9K,"Sweet, heartfelt series. The plots don't always make sense. It's kind of a light drama/gentle comedy. It's not that close to the movie it's based on, Dance Me Outside, other than having a couple of the same actors. The characters have the same names, but they're not really the same as they were in the movie. The movie was darker and had much more biting humor, and was very teen oriented, one of those coming of age stories that stay with you forever if you were 16 when you first saw it. This show is kind of a general family show, welcoming the same familiar characters into your living room with each episode.

The DVDs are good quality. It comes in a small cardboard cover, not plastic.",1486857600,4,692,4.448818897637795

8334653,4,B001PSUM9K,"I have heard about this TV series for years and now that I've seen it, wish I'd seen it when it first aired when I was a lot closer in age to the main protagonists. Wonderfully acted by very likable cast of characters, plot lines both humorous and poignant with strong threads of Native wisdom throughout. Very glad I got it.
