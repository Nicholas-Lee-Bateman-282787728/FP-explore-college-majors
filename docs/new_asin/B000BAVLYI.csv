8084043,5,B000BAVLYI,"This video is a hit for our entire family!  We actually like it even better than the first one (The Emperor's New Groove), which is also good.  Lots of funny, witty lines/scenes.  And we prefer the VHS version (versus DVD), since it holds up much better to a 3-year-old's and 5-year-old's handling.",1314489600,,298,4.6923076923076925
