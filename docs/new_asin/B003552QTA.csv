4070016,4,B003552QTA,"At an economic 83 minutes this flick fills the bill.  It's not classic stuff because it feels like half of a drive-in double feature.  Ostensibly a Western rehash of ""The Asphalt Jungle"" but it lacks that film's characterization.  Film is distinguished by some terrific performances notably from Ernest Borgnine and Katy Jurado.  Only reservation is the prohibitive cost for such a slight film.",1267142400,6,394,5.2063492063492065

8388706,5,B003552QTA,I thought it was well done.  Ladd is a favorite of mine.  I liked the interaction between the two men.,1410307200,,102,4.05
8388707,3,B003552QTA,"I enjoy the films of Delmer Daves, especially 3:10 to Yuma. While entertaining, this is not nearly as interesting or nuanced. Basically, it's a caper film -- two ex-cons attempt to swindle a nasty man who once swindled them. While Alan Ladd is just walking through his role, Ernest Borgnine gives his character some real substance. There is a fun finale at the end, which I won't give away.",1398470400,,390,4.666666666666667
8388708,4,B003552QTA,"Excellent casting and a great story. The movie is in color,83 minutes in length,family friendly,4 out of 5 transfer, and well acted. In my opinion it could have ended a tad differently to improve the story, but overall a good movie...support your favorite artists.",1390003200,,264,5.0227272727272725
8388709,3,B003552QTA,"""Unless you want to see your own gravestone on your way to hell, you'll be on the next stage. Now that leaves here tomorrow at sundown. And you're going to like it. It crosses the desert at night. It's cooler then.""

For all the constant complaints about the stream of remakes these days, modern studio chiefs are positively tardy in remaking their hits compared to their predecessors. MGM didn't even wait a decade to remake 1950's The Asphalt Jungle way out west as 1958's The Badlanders, and a pretty good job they did of it too. That said, it's a very loose remake, only using the bare outline of W.R. Burnett's novel and practically none of the characterisation, even throwing in a happy ending as Alan Ladd's geologist is sprung early from Yuma prison and decides to take revenge on Kent Smith's mine owner whose family framed him by breaking into his own mine to steal what he's owed - and even gets the mine owner to finance it for a cut of the take by getting him to believe he's robbing another mine. Helping him is Ernest Borgnine's initially reluctant fellow prison graduate, who dreams of owning a ranch with positively beatific tart with a heart Katy Jurado, and Nehemiah Persoff's Mexican 'powder monkey.'

Nobody here is as well drawn or as fallible as in Huston's film - even Smith's duplicitous moneyman who keeps his bit on the side Claire Kelly locked in a hotel room awaiting his visits has a couple more scruples than Louis Calhern's crooked lawyer in the original - but the film compensates with a decent heist and strong, visually striking direction from Delmar Daves that brings out the best in both the crumbling mine location and the corrupt town with its segregated oppressed Mexican and callously exploitative American populations. Unfortunately it starts to fall apart in the aftermath of the heist, the big shootout in the midst of a fiesta offering a few bits of excitement but little logic or credibility as they hurriedly try to neatly wrap up all the plot points and make certain that everyone gets their just desserts. As a result it's no classic, but it works more than well enough along the way to ensure you get your money's worth, especially if you get the chance to see it in its original CinemaScope ratio: cinematographer John F. Seitz certainly earned his pay here, particularly in the mine and prison scenes (it helps that Daves had a good eye as well), and he makes Jurado look truly luminous - I don't think I've ever seen her look as good in a movie as she does here.

It's worth bearing in mind that while Warner's French DVD of this is panned-and-scanned, Warner Archive's US-only manufactued on demand DVD-R is in the proper Scope ratio and also includes the theatrical trailer.",1374796800,4,2729,4.693110647181628

8388713,3,B003552QTA,"It would have helped if I had known that it lacked Subtitles & Closed Captions.  So, it cannot be reccomended for elders as the dialogue tends to be indistinque.  The film was well acted.",1288656000,,187,4.470588235294118
