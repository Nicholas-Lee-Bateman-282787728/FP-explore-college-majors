6355731,3,B00JEEZTB8,"While I've never seen him live, I'm a long time Manilow fan, and own his entire recorded output, including other live DVDs.  Playing this new DVD from his recent set of shows at Paris in Las Vegas, I have to wonder why he and/or his management elected to release this.  I'm sure it's a great souvenir for anyone that actually sees the show.  However, it is clear from the performances on the DVD that, like the rest of us, Manilow is aging and his performing skill is waning. Never mind how odd he looks after the extensive plastic surgery has glossed away every possible wrinkle on his face and left him without much elasticity in his facial expressions.  What struck me most was the mediocre vocal performances captured during this particular show.  He can still sing and has range but the strain is obvious at times throughout this show.  Manilow at his prime was great and there are many many high quality live performances you can buy.  However, I'd say this DVD is only for completists and persons who attended these shows and want a keepsake.  You certainly shouldn't buy it expecting to hear Manilow in his prime.  Sadly, he's past it.",1400803200,8,1143,4.618811881188119
6355732,5,B00JEEZTB8,I GOT MINE YESTERDAY! THE DVD IS SO WONDERFUL! BARRY MANILOW IS SUCH A PERFORMER TO HIS FANS! MY CAT CHARLIE JUST LOVES HIS MUSIC SO MUCH! HIS FAVORTIE SONG IS COPA AND CHARLIE JUST CAN'T GET EFFECT OF IT! THIS DVD IS WORTH GETTING IT FOR SHORE! YOU WOULD NOT BE DISAPPOINTANT IN THIS!,1400371200,2,285,4.2
6355733,4,B00JEEZTB8,"I had the opportunity to see the Paris show in 2011, and this brought back many great memories.  Barry is at his best here, looks and sounds great.

Why I wouldn't give it 5 stars, is that while it says it is 2 hours, it is only a little over an hour--the show in Vegas was 90 minutes, and I noticed some things were cut out from the show, such as Clive Davis introducing Barry in a 1974 clip. So, it could have easily been longer--also the camera quality wasn't as good as other videos I have seen. But, it is definitely worth it.  And I am sure I will watch it again in the next day or so!",1398816000,11,591,3.9495798319327733

If my DVD player wasn't connected to the internet and I couldn't have run the update, I would have been SOL. Great concert though.

6355775,5,B00JEEZTB8,"As a Barry Manilow fan since 1975, it doesn't get any better than this ! In fact, I am  going to see ""One Last Time"" this week. He never EVER disappoints. Great DVD,",1423440000,,165,4.0
6355776,5,B00JEEZTB8,It was almost as good as being there live.  I saw his show 8 years ago and the experience is wonderful. The backup singers and musicians are A+.,1422489600,,144,4.142857142857143

6355778,5,B00JEEZTB8,This is my top favorite of Barry Manilow's concerts. Had the opportunity to go see him in Las Vegas. He really does do a fantastic job of putting together a wonderful show for the audience. A must see for any Manilow fan!,1421020800,,221,4.285714285714286

6355780,3,B00JEEZTB8,"As a fan who has seen Barry in concert countless times, this show and DVD is a bit underwhelming, if not still good. The DVD length of 66 minutes is definitely not the full show. The track listing is also a bit deceptive - a bunch of the songs early in the show are actually part of a medley, so you really get just a small part of each song. Manilow fans know he does that, but for a non-fan to see the track listing on the DVD case without any indication of a medley, that's just wrong.

The DVD is basically a partial showcase of Barry's hits. No rare songs for the hardcore fans (""I Am Your Child"" has been played so many times in recent years it really doesn't qualify as rare anymore), and a few good songs off his embarrassingly-themed ""15 Minutes"" album are also here.

One odd moment came when Barry was introducing ""Brooklyn Blues"" (great song), with an old story of traveling ""back to Brooklyn"" in a ""bulletproof"" car. However, he says he went back ""a little while ago"" and then wrote this song about the experience afterwards. Well, since the song first appeared on his 1987 album ""Swing Street,"" That would make ""a little while ago"" about 28 years ago. Very awkward.

Barry also has a habit of not playing full songs much of the time, leaving out a verse to shorten it. That's still here a number of times too.

If you are someone who wants to check out Barry on DVD, I would suggest other ones and passing this by. A DVD release of his fairly recent St. James Theater Broadway run would be ideal, as those were really great shows.",1418515200,8,1544,4.3321799307958475

6355796,1,B00JEEZTB8,"Nothing on this DVD. It is amateurish in its filming, and the sound  along with the DVD's lack of content makes it out to be a glorified demo. Something is in the early stages of development with this final product, but how anyone could call this product ""complete"" or ""professional"" is the biggest flaw here. The packaging is boring. The program is loaded with errors. This DVD looks to be like a rough demonstration of a music video in the works.",1410739200,,448,4.530864197530864

Barry is the BEST and he puts so much love and emptions in each song.  You can tell just how much he loves singing to us.  He is a master showman, plus he is a super nice man too.  His band and backup singers are incredible also.

Anyone who loves Barry and even those who aren't fans of his will love this DVD too.

8650223,2,B00JEEZTB8,I was hoping to enjoy some music concerts from my youth. This didn't do it. This concert is from an old and stiff Barry Manilow. The tempo is off. Music just drags. He has to get the audience to sing to help out. Sometimes he speaks the lyrics instead of fluently singing to way he used to. I know I've gotten old too. I was just hoping to relive the past.,1476489600,,356,4.028169014084507
