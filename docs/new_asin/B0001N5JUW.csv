8128231,3,B0001N5JUW,"I was in the cast of this ""masterpiece.""  Watching it now -- well, it's cute.  I know a tiny bit more about football than I did in the early 1990s.  However, what sticks out is the video quality.  It's not even film!  However, if you want a lark and a cute cheerleader asks you to buy it, have fun watching!  The one review notes the defensive football teacher looked as if he played for the ""alternative team.""  Truer words were never spoken.  The actor was super nice but I cannot believe the audience was expected to believe he knew anything about football.  I was the girl who took the ""Defensive Football 101"" class multiple times.  To this day, I still do not know what a safety does.  That's acting, folks! Make the audience believe you know of what you speak......I bought this because it is fun....if you can pick it up for a dollar or two, go for it!",1226534400,2,860,4.345911949685535
