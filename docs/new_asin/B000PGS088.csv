8191306,4,B000PGS088,"The movie did not have subtitles. I think that needs to get put out there immediately. Even with that issue, you can still mostly follow the story. It's a curry western. Aka, Indian guys riding horses in the untamed areas out by Pakistan where they fight bandits, which are now mostly jihadist types and seems like that's what they were mostly back then too.

The movie itself is pretty fun too. You get Feroz Khan's hilariously hairy chest that he can't quit showing, surprisingly exciting and well shot gun fights, horse chases, crazy sets along with set design, mini skirts, go-go boots, an Indian lady in one of the best red head wigs ever, and of course song and dance. It all comes at you in rapid succession. It never slows down and it was shocking how quick it felt. I thought I'd only watched 10 minutes of the movie only to find I'd watched about 30. It could just be me and my love of campy over the top stuff like this that caused that effect but the movie seems to have real forward momentum on it.

Worth catching and I'm sure it even has a better plot with subtitles.",1460851200,,1082,4.378109452736318
