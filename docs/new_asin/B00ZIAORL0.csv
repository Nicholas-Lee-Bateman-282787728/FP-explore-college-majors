8720334,1,B00ZIAORL0,"I have purchased this item three times, now, and none of the copies I received played on any of my dvd or Blu-ray players.  I even bought a Blu-ray player, just to see if that would help.  Has anyone out there bought this movie in dvd form, and had it play?  If I change to a Blu-ray copy, will IT play?",1481500800,,303,3.9344262295081966
8720335,3,B00ZIAORL0,FAR BELOW the expectation that it would be a good as the original FFTB - story segments and acting not bad - just fell very flat from the original movie this is supposed to be based (LOOSELY) UPON.  Very strongly suggest renting it or waiting until price drops to under $10 to buy it.,1449964800,,284,4.2592592592592595
