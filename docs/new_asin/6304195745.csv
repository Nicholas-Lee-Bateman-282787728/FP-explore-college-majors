7865186,3,6304195745,"VHS tape was damaged in 1 spot for about 30 seconds. The rest of the tape was fine. Delivery was very fast. Content- my least favorite of the Grind series, but still an excellent workout.",1310860800,,187,4.371428571428571
7865187,5,6304195745,"This was one of the first exercise videos that I ever did and I've enjoyed it for more than a few years now.  The opening warm up is much longer than most of the other videos I own and it stretches a lot more muscles than, say, the Cardio series does.  A good 45 minutes long, the people in it teach the dance steps one at a time and constantly repeat them to ensure that the viewer understands them.  The camera work is decent - it doesn't go into too many close-ups and allows the viewer to see the foot movements - and the people actually doing the exercises aren't nearly so godawful annoying as many other of the dancers on other exercise videos are.  (Cardio Salsa, I'm lookin' at you!)
True, this is a light-weight video when it comes to the amount of energy required, but it's perfect for those of us who are perpetually out-of-shape and it makes exercise enjoyable again.  Plus, the music isn't horrible, either.  MTV did a good job with this one.",1074988800,3,956,4.372881355932203
