Just a couple of episodes to pop in the DVD player to satisfy her need to see the show no matter what time of day. Great copy of show, clear DVD not a cheap bootleg. The perfect length for an afternoon Laura Engalls fix!",1362787200,,308,3.9047619047619047

8313778,5,B001JV5B9O,"I'm a lifetime fan of Little House on the Prairie, the books and the iconic television series. When I was a little girl,I remember sitting down with my family every week to watch the TV episodes, following the exploits of Laura Ingalls and her family on the prairie.

This DVD is a sort of compilation of three episodes featuring Laura and Mary Ingalls. The episodes are:
Country Girls - centers on Laura and Mary's first day at school in Walnut Grove and how Nellie Olsen torments them, teasing them about the way they dress etc
The Spring Dance - Laura and Grace Snider try their best to get asked to the spring dance, with unexpected results
Little Women - Laura and Mary prepare for a school play with Ginny Clark, and the sisters learn that Ginny is desperate to see her single parent mom find love.

There may be only three episodes here, but I felt that this DVD is perfect for entertaining a young girl [perhaps aged 5-10], and I don't have to scan through my old Little House DVDs looking for the episodes. I really don't care for some of the so-called kids entertainment on TV these days. With the exception of a few shows, most appear inane and don't really promote any good values. Little House on the Prairie harks back to more innocent times, and for a few minutes at least, we can all be transported to a more wholesome era.

This DVD runs for about 140 mins, is in full screen format and comes with a bonus bookmark.",1239840000,13,1432,4.437262357414449
8313779,5,B001JV5B9O,I bought this for my daughter to watch in the evening to unwind and it really does the trick. It is nice to have her watching something other than Disney and Nickelodeon since those are the only stations that has anything for kids anymore.,1236816000,4,239,4.454545454545454
