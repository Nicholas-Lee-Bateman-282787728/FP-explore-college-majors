4607899,5,B0058YPPN0,Why did FX drop this series and allow it to migrate to direct tv?  This is possibly the best show on television.  I can't wait for the dvd to be released. I want to see it NOW.,1315958400,21,176,3.72972972972973

4607951,5,B0058YPPN0,Glad DirecTV picked up seasons 4 & 5 and gave us a little more to close out the series. Thankfully no cliff hanging ending but appropriate for they way the show is setup.,1459036800,,170,4.181818181818182
4607952,4,B0058YPPN0,"Damages continues on after being canceled by FX and is taken up by Direct TV for Season 4.  As observed by others the quality wasn't quite as good as 1-3 but still engaging enough.  The target of our protagonists Patty Hewes (excellent Glenn Close) NYC ruthless attorney and her off again/on again associate Ellen Parsons (Rose Byrne) is a private military security company (think Blackwater or Custer-Battles) and their CEO Howard Erickson (a miscast John Goodman).  An old high school boyfriend of Ellen's is a contractor for the company named High Star and is suffering PTSD symptoms after an off the books illegal mission goes bad and 3 other contractors are killed.  Ellen who's working for another firm now which lacks the resolve of Hewes & Associates enlists Patty's help in bringing a suit against High Star using her friend as her prime witness.  In typical Damages fashion the story unfolds in bits and pieces, there are false trails and partial reveals that deceive the viewer until almost the very end when everything comes together.  A rogue CIA agent (Dylan Baker) provides plenty of obstacles for Ellen to overcome in her quest for justice for her friend and the dead men's families.

 I agree with others that there wasn't enough Patty compared to the earlier season's and the plot line about her grand daughter (of whom she has custody of) first being sick and then when her estranged son Michael reappears and challenges her for custody seemed like a needless diversion.  Also the court appointed anger management counseling she has to go through after hitting her building's doorman in the face with a door was pointless filler.  Others have complained about the language being worse and perhaps more violence but honestly, this is an adult show and it's 2016 so my advice is don't watch and go back to your re-runs of the Andy Griffith Show so you're not offended.  Lastly, other reviewers took issue with Goodman's character being portrayed as devoutly Christian and being the bad guy; well history offers us no shortage of evil perpetrated under the umbrella of organized religion and it's followers so I don't see the problem, it's called reality.",1454803200,,2171,4.920547945205479

4607955,5,B0058YPPN0,"I have only caught snatches of the series here and there, but watched this season because I love Chris Messina. This season feels like a movie inside a TV show. That's because Messina, Goodman, and Baker are primarily film actors, so the level of acting was off the chain. Messina and Baker, both criminally underrated actors, stole the show, IMO. Though he didn't have a lot of screen time, Messina was unforgettably heart-wrenching as the vet with PTSD, while Dylan Baker gave an amoral, sociopathic character mystery and depth. As for Goodman--well, one scene between him and Messina was a master class in acting and remained with me for a long time.  The plot was an indictment of companies like Blackwater, and how using private companies as mercenaries can have tragic consequences. I know Glenn Close and Rose Byrne were in this season, but I honestly don't remember any of their scenes. That's how powerful these three wonderful actors are. SO...by all means--watch it!",1446768000,,977,4.9573170731707314

4608126,3,B0058YPPN0,"I'm series-binging and just finished season 4.  Watching the whole thing over a short period of time is interesting.  Season 4 seems rather ""vacant"", as though the writers weren't on their game.  Big plot holes and threads that aren't going anywhere. Gratuitous nudity appeared and more of the f-bomb as fillers.  John Goodman's character was poorly drawn and poorly acted as a Bible spewing mercenary with 4 obese kids in cahoots with a nut-job CIA agent who gets a bunch of people killed in Afghanistan while illegally extracting a supposedly-terrorist informant who turns out to be a kid who turns out to be the agent's kid so then he has to break his lover's neck, blah, blah, blah, what????  Rose Byrne (not my fave anyway) seemed perpetually hang-dog and droopy eyed.  Glenn Close/Patty is forced into this silly subplot about retaining custody of her granddaughter who is never seen.....it's a non-working theme.  Glenn Close could act her way through anything but she was given pretty disjointed stuff this season.  On to Season five.",1395273600,,1042,4.982658959537572

4608129,2,B0058YPPN0,"Bad language, nudity, senseless violence, just to name a few of the changes from earlier seasons.

What a disappointment.

How does a series focused on NYC lawyers suddenly end up with a plot that includes wartime PTSD and Afghanistan security missions? Did someone think that the viewing audience wouldn't notice?

The show turned from Law Review to the National Inquirer.",1390003200,,373,5.183333333333334
4608140,5,B0058YPPN0,"I purchased the Fourth and Fifth Season of Damages as a gift for a friend, and it was definitely well received.  Great gift idea for those hooked on the series.",1388448000,,160,4.333333333333333
4608141,4,B0058YPPN0,"After three seasons on basic cable's FX channel, Glenn Close's brilliant legal drama was given a new lease on life when DirectTV picked it up for a fourth season. The ensuing season was not quite as dramatically gripping as earlier ones but still well above the level of most network television.

Damages tells the story of Patty Hewes (Glenn Close), a highly successful plaintiff's attorney who specializes in massive class actions against scummy fat cat corporate defendants. Each season, the show focuses on one single major case, but, although it's a legal drama, the show almost never goes inside the courtroom. Instead, we see Hewes and her opponents taking depositions, making settlement offers, and preparing themselves for trials that never actually ensue.

Patty Hewes is an antiheroic force of nature, just as ruthless as her corporate adversaries and driven by an almost fanatic will to win. Although she often says she's in this for her clients, in reality, it's her own inner demons (that the show gradually reveals) that drive her. The show's other main character is Ellen Parsons (Rose Byrne), a younger attorney originally hired as an associate by Patty, but who winds up to a certain extent following in Patty's footsteps. The difference between what Patty does and what Ellen does not always choose to do, as well as the sometimes bitter rivalry/friendship that develops between the two, is the show's dramatic center.

In the fourth season, Ellen meets a former high school friend Chris Sanchez (Chris Messina), who is now an Afghan war vet with a bad case of PTSD. Sanchez was most recently employed by Highstar, a Blackwater-like defense contractor. His last mission went badly wrong, killing three members of his squad and leaving him an emotional mess. Ellen is convinced that Highstar was responsible for both Sanchez' condition and the other men's death and brings a lawsuit, but her current firm drops the case and she goes to Patty for help. As the season goes on, both the CEO of Highstar, John Goodman, and a shadowy operative who was involved in their dirty work, Dylan Baker, try to stop the lawsuit.

The DirectTV version of Damages has the same high quality writing and ensemble acting as the FX version, but the season is only ten episodes of about 50 minutes each (as opposed to 13 in the first three seasons). The reduced running time means that the story line is somewhat more streamlined, so that there is considerably less of the intricate jumping around in time and place that became the show's trademark. In addition, there are fewer supporting characters and subplots than before. Most viewers will be able to guess the key plot twists well in advance. The show does benefit from being free of basic cable censorship restrictions, with some nudity and a fair amount of profanity (although somewhat less of both than you'd likely see on an HBO series).

We don't see as much of Patty's and Ellen's emotional development as we did in former seasons, and Ellen in particular seems willing to cut Patty a lot of emotional slack in her desire to see justice for her clients. Fortunately for viewers, this season offers juicy supporting turns for Goodman and Baker. Goodman's CEO is equal parts right wing patriot, religious zealot, and loving single father to four boys. Baker is genuinely creepy in a role that rivals his recurring guest appearances on The Good Wife.

All in all, the fourth season is a welcome addition to the series. Close, Byrne, and the writers are not just going through the motions to milk a few more dollars out of a fading show. Instead, the central story line is as solid as ever, lacking only a little of the glitz and depth, which is primarily a function of the reduced length of the season. Damages is still one of the best television dramas around.",1388188800,,3817,4.8556067588325655
4608142,2,B0058YPPN0,"Loved seasons 1 through 3. Not a fan of this season. Too slow, not a fan of John Goodman, not a fan of the theme (evil military complex), too cliched.",1385856000,,150,4.033333333333333
4608143,5,B0058YPPN0,"I love Damages. It's been a few years since I saw season 3 (when it was still on FX) so I wasn't sure if I would be as in to it as I used to be. But as soon as I started watching season 4 I was instantly reminded of why I liked this show so much. I'm hesitant to say this season is my favorite, because season 1 was so good. However, I'm going to say it anyway. This season is my favorite so far. The returning characters were all their usual excellent selves (especially Rose Byrne), and the writing and directing were also top notch as usual. I found the storyline for this season much more interesting than season 2 or 3. As for new characters, there were several fantastic performances. John Goodman's villain performance rivaled Ted Danson's Frobisher, which was a pleasant surprise. Dylan Baker was outstanding as a shady CIA agent. And Chris Messina was great in a very sympathetic role. I really enjoyed watching these characters more so than those of seasons 2 & 3. Being the first season not subject to cable TV sensoring added some extra intensity as well, spicing things up a little but not overdone. It wasn't perfect, however. I could've done without the subplot with Patty, her son, and adopted daughter. And I don't care for some of the convoluted attempts to create suspense (cars pulling up just in the nick of time, phones ringing just in the nick of time, a guy deciding to use the water fountain just as he is about to come face to face with the prison guard looking for him, etc.). The show is great to begin with so for me these over-the-top attempts to create extra suspense just fall flat when they are overused and unnecessary. But these few flaws did not prevent me from enjoying this installment of what has been an exceptional series. Looking forward to watching season 5 now.",1383782400,,1805,4.48936170212766
4608144,5,B0058YPPN0,"I have purchased all the season and watching the fourth seasons now love this show.  Like to watch the DVD's as you do not have to wait to next week you can watch all at once, wanting more.",1382832000,,189,3.973684210526316

4608146,4,B0058YPPN0,"This series is surprisingly good and much better than I was expecting when I ordered it.  I was never a fan of the actors and actresses in this series.  Still they manage to delver a pretty good series with better than average excitement, and story content.  The biggest problem with this one is the direction and cutting.  This series skips around in time and jumps back and forth so often that it is difficult to follow the story line at times.  With better direction and a less choppy presentation this could have been a 5 star series.",1378166400,,538,4.505154639175258
4608147,5,B0058YPPN0,"The fourth season is definitely the best of all five, and the other four were all very good, but the addition of John Goodman made it superlative. His acting was forceful, natural, and just perfect for the part he played. Damages is not a series for someone looking for quick action and adventure. It is more of a slow moving drama with a ""real to life"" feel about it, and the use of flashbacks in the story telling can be confusing to some. It forces you to watch carefully for a number of episodes before you can follow what's going on and the temptation may be ""not to bother"" for those looking for quick gratification. But it is definitely worth the while to continue watching as the acting is excellent, and there are many unexpected twists and turns that make the entire series exciting but still very realistic. I really enjoyed.",1377993600,,836,4.543046357615894

Season 4 was superb  and I believe season 5 is out or will be soon....I know I WILL be getting it sight unseen ,  because even if its bad it will be better than almost anything else out there.

I would still recommend it to fans of the series but the excellence of the first three seasons just waaaasnt quite there. Excellent acting, good story but the structure seemed a bit repetitive and forced this time around and coupled with the marked drop in production quality it just didn't meet our expectations.

I will admit to having only watched the first episode of Season 4, but what happened to the BIG conflict between Patty and Ellen?  That episode had violence, torture, vulgarity and bad acting!!

4608273,4,B0058YPPN0,"Of course this show is implausible, & absurd at times, but it is fun & addictive. Yes, anyone with
Cheney-like politics who believes in war-for-profit and ""special interrogation"" techniques will not enjoy this season. But the rest of us w/ hearts & minds will enjoy it fully. The weakest part of this series is Chris Messina being mostly locked-up and doing nothing. Maybe the show is on a shoestring budget because the Afghanistan imprisonment scenes didn't even vaguely seem to be set in the Middle East. I was hoping it would turn out that Chris Messina was being held in Erickson's compound in America all the while.

The main reason I give Season 4 four stars, and reason to watch this season is Dylan Baker, an actor I'd never heard of. He plays the rogue CIA agent with a mixture of charm, menace, laid-backness, heart & heartlessness. You know if he's hugging someone and crying, he's probably going to kill that person an instant later. He has the '70's Jack Nicholson voice going & acts like your best friend, except he believes in nothing and no one. His complex portrayal even outshines Glenn Close, who sadly, is under-utilized in this season. Of course she's still fantastic, but more limited here. At first I hated John Goodman in this (though I like him as an actor), but he grew on me like a fungus by the end. I hope Season 5 is coming soon. They need to get back to Patty fighting her son, Ellen, & her personal demons. Was Keith Carradine's architect just a hallucination in Season 3?

4608310,2,B0058YPPN0,"As a huge fan of Damages I have clung to every episode like an addict awaiting my fix. This show hit the ground running- it was intense and addicting from the very first shot in which the elevator doors open and out stumbles our protagonist Ellen, the poor weak little waif who wanders out the door and into our tv world plus into the world of antagonist sociopath Patty who, by the way, makes Alex Forrest from ""Fatal Attraction"" look like Mother Theresa.

I think I totally marathon-watched every single ep for not just the first season but also the second and third within probably a week. I was that hooked. Then for some reason the FX channel dropped it (probably b/c it didn't have enough profanity and borderline porn that their other shows offer) and I had to retrieve seasons four and five from the internet. As with Mad Men's 5th season which also came after an unexpected delay I found the series had declined. The characters are still riveting but the writing just didn't generate much interest with its plots and storylines which used to be full of twists. The genius of the first three seasons just seems to have bailed out of the fourth and fifth seasons.

(Since season five is not here to review I'm gonna comment on both of the last two seasons.) The plot in season four is just not as interesting. The same can be said of season five. Only season five is worse. Everything bad about season four is doubled in season five really. Both seasons show too much flashing back- in season four, it is within the season- they keep showing the same scenes repeated over and over. In season five, they keep showing either dreams recurring over and over or they show flashbacks from the first, second and third seasons. Season five also consists of a lot of shots of Ryan Phillipe's naked butt as he bangs various chicks. Then there are various scenes that drag on and on while the viewer waits for something ANYTHING to happen. For example, Patty and Ellen are stranded in a Maine airport during a snowstorm. I thought something good was gonna happen but the only ""excitement"" that occurred was when Patty broke in to the liquor cabinet. WHOA!!! The whole episode practically was devoted to the two women sitting in an airport munching on crackers from the vending machine. It's actually even less exciting than I'm making it out to be. They could have added some shots of the paint chipping off the walls and that might've helped!

Both seasons were very slow and too convoluted. What really made the show exciting during the first three seasons was not only the great characters but also the fast-paced movement of the show- it didn't wait for you. During the first three years, from the minute each season started it was like an adrenaline rush to see each new episode and find out what was gonna happen. It was exciting. I got so many people hooked on Damages in the beginning. EVERYONE loved it. Sadly, though, all good things must come to an end. I'm sure it's dfficult to maintain that kind of stamina year after year. So if you are a fan of the show (at least for the first three seasons) but debated about whether or not to purchase seasons four and five, beware that the two final seasons may not live up to the standard set by the previous three. They are still better than like 95% of the crap on tv now but just don't get your hopes up.

Glenn Close and Rose Byrne are still amazing in their roles and the guest stars add a lot as well- John Goodman in season four and Ryan Phillipe in season five. But performances are not enough to save a failing show. As I said, all these good shows eventually start to decline- I loved the first few seasons of Mad Men as well as Breaking Bad and Sons of Anarchy but all have just lost their luster in my opinion. I wish I had better news- I believe as with Mad Men that I am in the minority when I say the show isn't as good but that's fine. I'm glad some people still like the shows. However, I see from other reviews that it's not just me. Whatever... people are entitled to their opinions and I'm sure people who vehemently support a show no matter how bad it gets will certainly express that. But I'm just trying to be helpful to those people who, as I said above, may be debating about watching/purchasing seasons four and five. To them I say: get them off the internet or from Net- -flix but save your money if you were thinking of buying them.",1362700800,,4410,4.440740740740741
4608311,2,B0058YPPN0,"After watching Damages Season 4, I have to agree with the observations of several others:  Seasons 1-3, produced by FX, were much better.  I found the writing to be weak.  Plot contrivances popped up several times when the writers backed themselves into corners they couldn't get out of (don't want to spoil it by listing examples for those who may not have seen it).

If you enjoy high-quality productions, you liked Seasons 1-3, and you're wondering whether to purchase Season 4, I'd say to do so only if money is not an issue.  Otherwise, you can probably find better uses of your hard-earned cash.",1362528000,2,601,4.740384615384615

4608313,1,B0058YPPN0,"I was rather fond of ""Damages"". I bought seasons 1-3 on DVD and would probably have rated them a solid four stars. I think the scripts were rather good, and I just like looking at Rose Byrne who, though a bit dour, is one of the prettiest actresses I know.

However, after buying the season 4 boxset and watching about forty minutes of episode 1, I was forced to quit watching altogether.

My main reason was that they have decided to worsen the language in this season, resulting in more than a dozen uses of the F-word in this episode alone. If I had checked Imdb before buying, I would have known that this unexpected change affected both seasons 4 and 5.(I just learned from another one-star review that seasons 1-3 were produced by FX and seasons 4 and 5 by DirecTV.)

As in previous seasons, there is also a lot of drinking in the series. In the first scenes of the episode, virtually every character is shown with a glass of alcohol in his or her hands, even discussing their favorite poison.

Moreover, the bad guy of the new show is a strawman Christian private security CEO. Of course, the villain has to be a successful father who says grace before meals.",1361491200,4,1166,4.460093896713615

4608378,1,B0058YPPN0,"The good news is that DirecTV rescued ""Damages"" after FX dropped it.
The bad news is that DirecTV rescued ""Damages"" after FX dropped it.

For three seasons ""Damages"" was a slickly produced series from FX, the network that brought us ""The Shield."" It is not in the same league as ""The Shield,"" but few series are. FX decided not to renew the series because of poor ratings, so DirecTV picked up Seasons 4 and 5. I have no idea how this change impacted the series (some individuals, myself not included, feel that the series began its decline in Season 3), but this much is clear: Season 4, by far, is the worst season of ""Damages."" It is bad by any yardstick, not just when compared to the preceding seasons.

""Damages"" takes us into the world of high-powered New York litigator Patty Hewes (Glenn Close). Equal screen time goes to Ellen Parsons (Australian actress Rose Byrne), who, fresh out of law school, joins Hewes's firm and becomes a protge of Patty's. It is a world of master-of-the-universe types who, with a phone call or two, can derail a career or end a life. It's conspiracy-heavy and not always plausible, but a top-notch cast playing, for the most part, complex, three-dimensional characters, coupled with a fast pace and non-linear story lines - employing frequent flash-backs and flash-forwards - made the first three seasons entertaining.

Season 4, which focuses on a private security company  la Blackwater USA and an incident involving it and the CIA in Afghanistan, is a failure on nearly every level: neither the characters nor the story is compelling; plausibility is nil; and the production (especially the scenes set in Afghanistan) has a low-budget, backlot feel.

4608494,4,B0058YPPN0,"By switching from F/X to DirecTV, two things are obvious from the beginning of the 4th season of ""Damages"". First, the production budget is clearly less substantial. Second, the show is no longer bound by network standards, and mostly this is apparent due to an abundance of f-bombs. These elements give the season more of the feel of an independent film, as opposed to a glossy network drama.

But the show remains compelling. Mostly this is due to the central characters of Patty Hewes (Glenn Close) and Ellen Parsons (Rose Byrne), the complex and twisted relationship these characters share, and the chemistry between the two actresses that play them. Patty and Ellen's relationship is part mentor/prot&eacute;g&eacute;, part mother/daughter, part predator/prey and part just full-on catfight. Patty is a brilliant, manipulative and often vicious woman whose heart beats occasionally. Ellen is a brilliant, mostly well-intended woman who often finds herself capable of more manipulation and viciousness than she thought possible. This yin/yang dynamic drives the series.

Almost as important as the two leads are finding compelling actors to play the season's villains, who are usually powerful people caught up in corruption and atrocity and desperately trying to avoid having their secrets come to light. This season offers John Goodman as CEO of a Blackwater-esque private company involved in the war in Afghanistan. After one of their missions goes terribly awry, several of its employees are murdered, and a ruthless mercenary (Dylan Baker, even more terrifying than he was in ""Happiness"") is at the center of it.

It seems that some people were unhappy with the show's decision to take on the wars in the Middle East, but I don't see why they would be. It's just as topical as last season's ""Ponzi-scheme-on-a-massive-scale"" case. John Goodman's character is a fascinating study in compartmentalization. The character routinely makes decisions that involve torture, abuse, and murder, but is then able to carry on his roles as father and religious leader without seeming too conflicted. This is believable partly due to John Goodman's performance, but also due to how commonplace such people are.",1349136000,,2205,5.330459770114943

4608496,4,B0058YPPN0,"Damages seems to be able to come up with fascinating plots and riveting storylines each season.  I'm very sorry to see it coming to an end.

The fourth season continues some of the on-going stories but concentrates mostly on a slimy character excellently protrayed by John Goodman.  What disturbs me, however, (but shouldn't surprise me) is the penchant for Hollywood to always choose a ""right-wing Christian"" character (who isn't a real Christian in any sense of the word) as the antagonist every time they decide to turn from the usual villains (i.e., mean Russian guys, Italian-American gangsters, creepy Arab-type terrorists, etc.)  The writers seem to concentrate so much on stereotyping that the credibility suffers.  Goodman's character, Howard Erickson (CEO of a private security firm participating in subversive actions in Afghanistan) is an unsympathetic, misguided radical while the equally outstanding Dylan Baker (who I think completely stole the show) protrays a mercenary you start out hating but end up almost understanding and identifying with.  Some of it it hard to watch and sometimes reverts to scathing editorializing on the evils of private security firms (did these companies even exist before our armed services were decimated by the government?)  However, it still tells a great story, makes some interesting points along the way, and gives you a lot to think about.

That being said, this is an excellent show and, in the end, I'm happy to say that the bad guys usually always have to pay for their crimes and indiscretions.

4608498,4,B0058YPPN0,"Through its four seasons, one constant has made DAMAGES one of TV's most engrossing dramas:  Glenn Close and Rose Byrne.  Their love/hate relationship is expert acting at its best.  However, Season 4 is somewhat disappointing.  There isn't that sense of ""What the heck"" so prominent in the first three seasons.  The major storyline is too political and guns and glory.  The twists are very predictable right down to the identity of the ""target"" and Ellen's ""revenge"" on Patty.  I didn't get fully intrigued until the last 3 episodes.  Another annoyance was John Goodman's one-note performance.  His pouty face is almost comical.  Dylan Baker's tormented Boarman is a complex, frightening performance as is Chris Messina's heartbreaking turn as Chris Sanchez.  Veterans like Judd Hirsch, John Cullum, Keir Dullea and Fisher Stevens get lost in mundane supporting roles.

If people are fed up with our involvement in MidEast wars, sickened by waterboarding and other acts that we have punished armies of other countries for, and all the related bullshit, why on earth would we want to pay to see more of it on TV.

I think Season 4 was even better than Season 3! It takes a couple of episodes to get started, but just wait.  Once it gets going, you can't stop watching.  How deprived we were not to have the suspense of a weekly series on our DVRs. It feels like cheating, going from one episode to the next, but it's a great ride. The story has so many twists and turns, it stays fascinating from beginning to end.  It's nice that the DVDs allow you to watch the episodes without the recaps at the beginning.

The plot is so dark and disturbing this time, I thought I might have bad dreams after watching it.  If you get the DVDs, be sure to watch the outtakes in the special features on the last disc.  It's welcome levity, after the somberness of the actual series, to see Glenn Close laugh at her own missed lines or Rose Byrne break up in a scene.  A great treat this season is the performance of Dylan Baker.  You've never seen a character like this on TV before.  It was absolutely a privilege to watch.

Glenn Close is hardly in it at all, and the sub-plot(s) with her little girl's illness and then return of Patty's estranged son seemed unnecessary and tedious. John Goodman gives a great performance but for me , the allure of Damages is watching all Patty's scheming and plotting slowly being revealed and her twisted relationship with Ellen.

4608660,5,B0058YPPN0,"Season 4 of Damages was more as a set up for the 5th and final season. Everything you loved about the previous 3 seasons (crazy plot twists, and great characterization) is still there. The only thing that I felt wrong with this season was that it seemed a little rushed. (The writers were cut 3 episodes with the move to DirectTV). Although the season is a little rushed, it's edgier and more realistic than the previous 3 seasons. The ""R"" rated language, they were allowed to get away with, definitely brought depth to some of the military characters. Damages has always been a gritty show, but now, it's even grittier and darker than ever. This season set up the final season perfectly,(SPOILER, setting up an Ellen vs Patty arc).

4608665,5,B0058YPPN0,"While neutral about the season 3 (I thought it was too short and disjointed), I found season 4 to be just as smart, suspenseful, superbly plotted,  and expertly acted as ever. It's the best season since its debut, and still one of the most relevant-to-the-times dramas on television.

Our heroine Ellen and anti-heroine Patty take on High Star, a private defense contractor integral in illegal interrogation and extraction activities in Afghanistan. One botched mission serves as platform for a lawsuit.  The true purpose of that mission is an underlying mystery known to only one character, which is revealed bit by bit.  This is not your typical wartime terrorism, and solving this mystery is essential to the plot so trust that the battlefield flashbacks are relevant and not just filler. Because the CIA is in bed with High Star, it's also not your typical corporate corruption.  The stakes to protect the guilty are the highest and most dangerous they've ever been.  Ellen and Patty are warned and then threatened to stay away, and of course that makes them all the more hungry to continue.

In a heartbreaking performance, Chris Messina plays Chris Sanchez, a vet and High Star combat employee suffering from acute PTSD and racked with guilt after leading said botched mission.  He's an old friend of Ellen's and she convinces him to sue High Star for wrongful deaths - partly in the name of justice, but equally to feed her ambition. But her firm of record is not so ambitious -- so unable to win it without Patty, Ellen goes back to the lair, literally.

John Goodman is well cast as the CEO of High Star.  As a staunch Christian, he seemingly struggles reconciling his job and his faith. But through intense prayer (and because his back is up against the wall) he ends up justifying more and more manipulative, illegal and often violent acts as ""patriotism"" and ""God's will"". This character is indeed a right-wing stereotype -- he likes to hunt and read from his giant bible -- but it's an accurate portrayal of how ""for the good of national security"" is misused to feed monetary greed, justify betrayal and commit any heinous act under the sun.

Stereotypes aside, season 4 delivers an accurate dramatization of what happens when private industry leads military actions -- corporate greed always trump everything. Since Patty has a reputation for stomping out corporate greed and now dares to challenge the government, tactics to protect the guilty involve murder, torture, international terrorism, kidnapping and the power of one very clever, resourceful and unscrupulous CIA agent. Because he is always one step ahead, has bottomless resources, and will resort to anything, you wonder how the two lawyers stand a chance of winning this time.

This rogue CIA agent, while as evil as they come, is also multi-dimensional enough to be a different kind of villain. A jaded, reluctant patriot, he's hiding a secret which makes him at times sympathetic. This delicate balance is a genius portrayal by underrated actor Dylan Baker, who should win many awards. At first the ""reason behind it all"" as revealed through the CIA agent seemed weak enough to be a bit anti-climatic. I can see people saying ""all *that* for that?"" But it's more important to focus on how a simple mission spiralled out of control and how desperation to cover it up ruined so many lives.

Plus this season makes full use of suspenseful foreshadowing, the show's signature technique. Each episode delivers flash-forward glimpses of a violent and bloody act that's come, revealing a little bit more each episode. You think you know how it may go down, but there are plot twists up until the last minute where all is revealed. So the payoff delivers.

A subplot involves Patty, her toddler granddaughter, and her estranged son Michael. And of course there's the usual cross-manipulative, love-hate relationship between Patty and Ellen that, by the end, reaches an ugly impasse. I had to laugh a yet another last meeting by the water to reflect -- where we know Patty will continue her relentless pursuit of success at the expense of any and all meaningful relationships, while Ellen will continue to fight against following in her footsteps despite the fact that she's cut from the same cloth.

Kudos to Direct TV for picking-up the series after FX dropped it, so it can live on DVD. Prepare to be engrossed. You won't be disappointed.",1316217600,147,4411,4.917900403768506
4608666,4,B0058YPPN0,"This was one of my favorite shows, along with The Good Wife, The Shield, The Wire, Breaking Bad, and so on, and each season only got better the first three times.  I loved this show.  But Season 4, while certainly entertaining enough to watch, had enough detracting factors to prevent any hearty 5-star rating from this reviewer.  The first was the cast.

While John Goodman has never been my favorite actor, he wasn't terrible, but there were other weak links as well.  The story for one, about a CIA rogue who working within the services of a defense contractor in Afghanistan, manages to get a group of American soldiers killed on an 'unauthorized' mission.  The story becomes one of Ellen actually teaming up with Patty Hewes to take these guys on.  Her interest in it revolves around a former male friend from college who was leader of the group that was killed there.  Entirely too much time is spent with that actor (forget his name) and his flashbacks of Afghanistan and his buddies getting killed.  His performance was also just tolerable.  Likewise for the rogue CIA agent that got him embroiled in the mess.  And then there's John Goodman to top it off.  No, the cast, while having big names, were perhaps too familiar to pump a good sense of mystery into the story.  And the story itself and the events that go down were often slightly weak or unplausable, like in the end where the captive boy is allowed to run around free and 'socialize' with the prisoner.  Don't worry, I haven't given anything away.  But those who've seen it should agree that that scene made no sense and was only allowed to be for the sake of plot contrivance. This was not great film-making or HBO style TV in comparison to previous seasons.

However, lest I rant too negative, a bad season of Damages is still better than a lot of what else is out there, and I was pulled through the season fairly quickly and without too much groaning for the most part.  Close is still ferociosly Patty Hewes, though the element of she and Ellen sparing for their lives doesn't really exist in this season.  However, we are clearly set up for that by the end of the last episode (note - only 10 episodes this season).  Yes, if the end of this season is any indicator, there should be a good clash of the titans come Season 5, which I for one will be watching.",1316217600,19,2332,4.5095238095238095
