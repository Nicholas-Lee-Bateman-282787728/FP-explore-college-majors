3532311,5,B001DJLD3U,"This is a great movie if you love the show.  Dr. Who is a whole lotta froth in the first place.  C'mon, who stops evil doers with a sonic screw driver?  Good grief, some of the reviews are asinine.  Snobbery over a cartoon show is ridiculous.  This isn't Final Fantasy Advent Children.  It's Doctor Who.  It's family fun.  It's great.  Still have to listen hard to understand through the accents, but if you like the show, you should like the cartoon.  We enjoyed it a great deal.",1230163200,2,480,4.413793103448276
3532312,2,B001DJLD3U,"As A lifelong fan of the Doctor and a big fan of this style of animation in other works such as the animated reconstruction of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-The-Invasion/dp/B000KGGIR8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who - The Invasion</a>"" I have to say ""The Infinite Quest"" was a letdown. Sure it's neat to have the Doctor and Martha in another adventure, and the art is outstanding, but were it came up lacking was the vocal acting. With less movement and expression in this art-form it is required that the actors make up for the lack of there real life facial expressions with the vocal equivalents. That's something to be said for ""Troutman"" who when put to this type of animation has just as much expression in his voice as his animated antics on screen. Toby Longworth who plays Caw does a masterful job of outshining the main characters in this regard. This just should not be the case and should have been recognized by the director. Overall I'd give this a miss. That is, of course, unless you are a completionist or rabid fan. Whovians, you can blast me at [...]",1228867200,2,1127,5.097297297297297
3532313,4,B001DJLD3U,This is one of the good small adventures fit for both adults and kids. It's similar to the key to time adventure. A must have for Doctor Who fans. I love the animation and I enjoyed that they animated the title sequence. I'm happy that the same actors came back to do the voices and Anthony Head makes a brilliant villain.,1228521600,8,322,4.295081967213115
3532314,1,B001DJLD3U,"Where to start ... well, we have a highly-predictable and rather thin & inane plot.  Next we have voice-overs by the actors that sound just like they're reading a script in a studio.  Then there is the animation, if we can call it that.  I was going to call it Scooby-Doo animation, but even that is much better.  Here we have mostly 2D computer animation, punctuated occasionally by some 3D computer animation which does nothing but call attention to how flat and uninvolving the 2D animation is.  And the animation, by the way, is very limited and basic.  The eyes move from one side to the other, the head moves up & down, the mouth opens and closes, but that's about it.  Sure, it's got some nice colors and some interesting character design, but on the whole it comes off as something you'd expect to see on the internet, for free, not something you paid money for.  Sort of reminds me of Flash animation.  There you go.  You have been warned.",1227312000,9,948,4.491228070175438
3532315,4,B001DJLD3U,"BBC america shop needs to thanked for bringing this out in this region.
At first there was some doubt wether we would ever see this dvd available here.  Many fans went to the bbc america  shop website  and recommended this and it made a difference.  This is a fun cartoon adventure for the whole family which is worth buying and adding to your doctor who collection.  After all the classic doctor who stories  and newer doctor who are family friendly too.  I would suggest going both to the bbc doctor who site and the bbc america shop site and asking for further unreleased cartoon adventures that are provided from the online doctor who site as well. There is even a cartoon adventure of a version of the doctor played by richard e grant.  Anyways if you love doctor who you will enjoy this cartoon version of the newest doctor , and the price is very affordable too.",1220659200,32,869,4.490445859872612
3532316,4,B001DJLD3U,"This release assembles the individual weekly bits of a Doctor Who animated adventure originally broadcast on a BBC Children's activity show based around the BBC TV Show ""Doctor Who"" in 2006-7. It's the first time it's been available here in the U.S.

As such, it is episodic, and juvenile, rather thin on plot and fairly transparent for adult viewers. But the under-12 set will love it, and it's entertaining enough for adults, provided you're already a fan of the revamped BBC TV Series.

Non-essential Whovian programming if you're not a completist, but perfect for family viewing. Four out of five stars.",1220572800,61,607,5.0
3532317,3,B001DJLD3U,"The story of the Doctor on a quest to find the Infinite, a space ship from the Dark times that promises to grant people their heart's desire is intriguing, if a bit of a departure from typical New Who stories. In some ways, this felt like a classic adventure that involved hopping times and places for solutions.

While I understand this was originally created as a web series, I think Infinite Quest's biggest fault is that it's just not developed enough. It goes too fast leading to quick fix solutions and lack of development in understandng problems. This was a fun production, but I can't help feel it would have been more enjoyable at 90 minutes than it was at 45.",1394150400,,670,4.537190082644628

3532319,2,B001DJLD3U,"This isn't my favorite installment in the Doctor Who-niverse.  The animation isn't ""all that and a bag of ju-ju-bees""  but I've seen worse.  I think the premise for the story is pretty good here.  Possibly the beginnings of one of the best Doctor Who tales ever.  I just think it should have been expanded into a longer format; maybe like they used to do with the William Hartnell & John Pertwee shows where they'd have one adventure span three or four full episodes.  The story they started here really deserved a little more exploration and there were too many characters introduced whom NOBODY was meant to care about at all.  The whole thing goes something like this:
""Hello, I'm the Doctor and this is Martha Jones, and we're on a quest.""
""Hello Doctor.  I'm an ex-convict and I have the thing you need.  Prepare to die.""
""Run, Martha!""
(Off-screen violence ensues)
""Oh no, look, Martha... the ex-con has been disintegrated.  Oh well, at least now we can get the thing we need.""
And repeat that four times.
Also, it's incredibly corny.  Think Doctor Who meets SpongeBob Squarepants.  This one is obviously designed for a younger audience than the usual Doctor Who adventures.  So overall, it looks like they were off to a good start in the plot department but it really fell apart after the first day of work.  If they re-made this story in the style of the full-length TV show or maybe a movie, with a slightly older target audience and a proper devotion to plot and character development, then I might watch that.",1383523200,,1520,4.665413533834586

3532323,5,B001DJLD3U,Yes different animation but not really bad animation. The story was just like any other Doctor Who story but this time a treasure hunt.

3532346,3,B001DJLD3U,"This product is for hardcore Dr Who fans only.  The character animation in particular is minimal, and it makes Cartoon Network's old Sealab show look cutting edge in comparison.  The story was told in micro-installments, which gives it a choppy, almost disconnected sort of feel.  The plot is overly simplistic for a Dr Who story, but then again it came from a children's program, so it's probably suitable for its target audience.  The main villian is voice-acted by Anthony Stewart Head (Giles from Joss Wedon's ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" TV show), whom I quite like.  In a nutshell, if you have any of the older Dr. Who programs in your collection (before Christopher Eccleston as Dr #9), and actually enjoy watching them, you might enjoy this cartoon.  Otherwise, just wait for the next episode on BBC.",1282003200,,806,4.889705882352941
3532347,1,B001DJLD3U,"We love Doctor Who since we discovered the series in the Tom Baker Years and have seen many episodes by many Doctors since then, including those of the early ones we'd missed.

This cartoon is a total disappointment.  The plot was almost non-existent, the writing was a hole-riddled mash-up, the sound work had poor volume control, and the cartooning was cheap.

Seriously, save your money.  We'd had the other cartoon on order but cancelled it after seeing this one.  There are better uses for the money, including DVDs of real Doctor Who episodes as well as Torchwood and the Sarah Jane Adventures.",1281139200,,600,4.8431372549019605
3532348,4,B001DJLD3U,"I enjoyed this animated feature. It was a nice story with a great cast (Anthony Head, Giles of Buffy fame who has done several episodes of the new Who series as the villain). The animation was top notch. They matched the opening of the show beautifully. I would love to see a full episode animated for the adult set, although this did touch upon the unrequited love of Martha for the Doctor briefly at the end. It was better than I thought it would be. There are many extras on the disc including animation trials and behind the scenes interviews and voice over recordings with the actors (which I love). The Dr. Who staff really does a great job of giving fans behind the scenes info that we just love. It also showcases just how great David Tennant is with voice work. I miss him greatly in the new series. I think it is a great edition to the Who collection and I hope they do more of this type of show, but lean towards the adults more.",1276300800,2,940,4.286516853932584
3532369,3,B001DJLD3U,"This is an OK story for Dr Who. I assume it was considered too expensive for film so they used animation instead.
The main problem is that animation forces actors to over act a bit and the actors are already very expressive so the voices just go over the top.

3532372,3,B001DJLD3U,"The story was entertaining but the plot was kinda weak.  It definately seemed geared more towards children than true fans of Dr. Who.  My Children love this video by the way.  It runs like a Doctor Who version of 'Treasure Planet,' only not as good.  There is very limited intracate thinking like you see in the shows.

I certianly hope that the makers of Doctor Who continue to try this media, but come at it with the adult viewer in mind.",1236902400,3,440,4.382716049382716
3532373,4,B001DJLD3U,"If you're desperate for Doctor Who (and I usually am), you might be tempted to purchase this DVD. While it's fun to see the Doctor (voiced by David Tennant) and Martha (voiced by Freema Agyeman) again, this DVD, with its short, episodic style, will have more appeal for young children (the intended audience) than for adult viewers. One draw is Anthony Head as Baltazar, the villain of the piece.

It begins like the usual Doctor Who episodes with the teaser, followed by the credits. At first I was a bit distracted by the animation, as other reviewers have remarked. But after awhile, I got into the story as the Doctor and Martha travel to different worlds on the quest to find datachips for the starship Infinite (hence the title). They discover pirates (of a sort), a prison, and enough peril to engage the kids, but not frighten them to death. It's fun, but not earth-shattering.

I didn't expect to see the kind of limited-movement animation style on this side of Clutch Cargo (a cartoon from the 60s), but that's what you get with Infinite Quest. While the characters' hair doesn't blow in the breeze, their mouths move and their eyes blink. But I got used to that after awhile. (And the animation, at least, is tons better than Clutch Cargo.)

You'll recognize the music from ""School Reunion,"" an episode featuring Anthony Head (as some reviewers pointed out), and some from Martha's season (season 3) of Doctor Who. The DVD also contains interviews with David Tennant, Freema Agyeman, Anthony Head, Toby Longworth (who plays Caw), and the director, Gary Russell. I can't help wondering what another season of these shorts would be like with Donna Noble as the companion!

3532377,4,B001DJLD3U,"Not quite up to the standards that one would expect from Doctor Who in terms of writing, but on the whole a brilliant cartoon.
Some of the dialogue was a bit stilted and the storyline doesn't quite hold together. But it was obviously aimed at a younger crowd, and logic was occasionally cast aside in order to keep the action going. The animation was quite good and took advantage of the medium, using imagery and characters that would have been almost impossible to create (for anything less than the gross national income of Brazil)in a live-action show.
An excellent first attempt, and I look forward to the next feature.",1231459200,4,624,4.73394495412844
3532378,3,B001DJLD3U,"As an American fan of Doctor Who, I knew nothing about this animated version until this DVD was released in the U.S.  But I was intrigued by the very idea of an animated Doctor Who, and it's VERY inexpensive compared to the full-season sets, so I decided to give it a try.

As others have said, the overall feel of the show is that it is aimed at younger viewers (ironically, the BBC apparently considers the live-action WHO a kid's program, and everyone I know who watches it is over 30).  The plot reminded me a bit of watching the old Space Ghost cartoons from the 60's.

While the characters and background are beautifully rendered, the animation is a bit limited.  This is apparently the new accepted style for many animated series, but it takes some getting used to if you're a fan of classic cartoons.

And while the voice acting does appear lackluster at times, I thought Anthony Head (who also appears in the 2nd season episode ""School Reunion"") does a fine job as the villain.

Extras include brief behind-the-scenes featurettes on the making of the program.  While it's good to see David Tennant and the others working outside their normal venues, most folks will probably watch the bonus features once and never again.

Overall, The Infinite Quest is a mixed bag.  If you're a hardcore WHO fan, you'll get a kick out of it.  Casual fans, and those uninitiated to the world the time-traveling Time Lord, will probably wonder what the big deal is.",1230249600,27,1457,4.65234375

There is a lovely bit of The Doctor walking in the snow that is almost eerie with clever mimicry. These animators are very attentive to their craft. In the extras, there are some depictions of the evolution of versions of The Doctor, which shows how dedicated they were to getting him ""right"".  Martha, I think, is even better in cartoon form than in person. They've captured her impish grin admirably and the eyes... pure mischief.  In the series, she always seemed to be overcast with a tinge of jealousy and longing when The Doctor lavished her with uninhibited praise, but in animation, the cloud are swept away which puts a brightness on the overall mood. Tennant is such a brilliant voice actor that I see no reason not to continue this sort of work as a retrospective.
