4008498,2,B002X78QGI,"Everything Little bear wrote reflect my reaction to this video. I couldn't have said it any better. Waste of time and money. I would return it, but since I would only get half my money back, I will keep it for my 8-12 year old grandchildren as it is at their level of intelligence.",1279584000,5,281,4.222222222222222

4008500,2,B002X78QGI,Beautiful scenery and certainly a topic of our interest.  Tourist vacation souvenir aptly describes this DVD.  The narration fails a professional standard; text clearly read with occasional lapses of grammar with a voice sounding much like a teenager rather than one of a well-modulated professional. The package of picture and narration disappoints although the pictures are interesting. At the end of the DVD my guests were more happy that it was over than excited by the act of having seen something beautiful. A bit amateurish was one comment I received.,1267920000,5,558,5.188888888888889
4008501,5,B002X78QGI,"Awesome Alaska is seen in the Kelly/Fair DVD.

Great feature for the tourist or the family or schools.
DVD, Wonders of Alaska would be a perfect gift item as well.",1259452800,4,339,4.844827586206897

4008503,1,B002X78QGI,"This video is worthless! The information regarding the vidio is maybe ok but it does not tell you any locations & the video quality is antequated. I would not recomend buying this at all. Save your money & time & buy a book.

4008530,5,B002X78QGI,This Alaska dvd is one of the best DVD's I have ever seen.  Was watching it on my 50 inch HD TV and the glaciers were simply amazing.

8383492,5,B002X78QGI,This was a very beautiful program on Alaska.,1469664000,,44,4.625
8383493,5,B002X78QGI,Kids loved it. Great footage. Really nice facts in the narration. The voice was a bit weak. No evolutionary propaganda either like most nature movies.,1433721600,,150,5.04

8383495,1,B002X78QGI,"I cannot recommend this at all. Seriously, the narration was unbelievable. It sounded like a teenager was reading an oral report in class. It's obvious when someone is reading, and this was completely the case with this video. My whole family agreed it made watching it unbearable. We fast forwarded through half of it. Sorry to the writer, who was also the narrator, but in our opinion, the beauty of the video was overshadowed by the unprofessional narration. If you're wanting this to show kids, forget it. It will not hold their attention. It didn't even hold the interest of the adults in my family.",1403913600,,604,4.761904761904762
8383496,1,B002X78QGI,"Why not title the disc, The animals of Alaska? A complete disappointment for anyone searching to see Alaska. Not reccommended.",1396656000,,126,5.35

8383498,2,B002X78QGI,To me this is a waste of time more on the level for kids and I would not recommend this DVD!!!,1328572800,,94,3.5238095238095237
8383499,2,B002X78QGI,"Most of the reviews of this DVD are positive so all I can say is buy with care.  The quality of the images is only fair, though the subject matter is wonderful.  There is much repetition, particularly in the humped back whale section.  The narrator sounds like he/she is reading from a prepared script without much preparation.  As one reviewer put it - ""it sounds amateurish"".  You may want to look at DVDs made by the National Geographic Society or Alaska Geographic as well as others available from Amazon.",1327881600,,509,4.674157303370786
8383500,1,B002X78QGI,"Absolutely the WORST video I've ever seen! It should not be sold on Amazon as I've bought countless DVD's from this site.  We have a HD projector with a 92"" screen and the quality of this video is horrendous!  The color was gray, out of focus and worse than the VHS tapes we had transferred to DVD. I was so frustrated with this video both for the picture quality and the narration that it was turned off before it was 1/3rd seen. We have some beautiful DVD's both Blue Ray and HD which present Alaska in it's best form. Nothing I've ever seen was as discusting as this DVD. I'm sure it isn't even the lowest resolution for HD. It should be dumped in the nearest trash can. I wouldn't want anyone to think that the beautiful state of Alaska looks like this DVD. We lived in South Central as well as South Eastern, have taken the state ferry through the inside passage and the scenery is unsurpassed. Too bad this DVD was ever made as it is an insult to our most beautiful state. I STRONGLY recommend that you delete it from your inventory!
