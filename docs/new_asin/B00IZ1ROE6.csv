This is a great live document with good audio and video.
I am not a marillion expert and the only other thing of theirs i have is the misplaced childhood 5.1.
I actually bought this because my understanding was that it came with the 5.1 of sounds that can't be made. If that is the version you want, you'll need to go to the racket records website and order it from there. It has two concerts and the remixed album. This single concert version isn't listed, so i didn't know it existed.
A lot of the fish crew say hogarth cant sing, but this show would seem to suggest that's just bitter tears over the break up in the late eighties.
If you like emotive, long form songs by a solid band that know their instruments well, this is worth your dollars.",1517097600,,855,4.219512195121951
8646747,5,B00IZ1ROE6,"Great audio and video to match. Sounds that can be made, 5.1 and stereo. Why can't 90 % of Blu-rays be this good?",1485820800,,113,3.9565217391304346

Excellent service from seller.
If your reading this you are into Marillion...you will love it.  Of course you can purchase from Racket Records (marillion home) if you want the 2 concert version.",1468281600,,294,4.345454545454546
8646750,5,B00IZ1ROE6,"Been fan over Marillion since the beginning, and I am a huge fan of the Hogarth era. This is a high quality DVD, that really captures the Marillion live experience which I've been lucky to have experienced 7 times. I'd recommend this highly.",1454457600,,241,4.627906976744186

8646753,5,B00IZ1ROE6,"Having viewed a 100 Music DVD's I thought Marillion's 2013 Netherlands Concert is just plain 'other worldly'.

It has to be the most emotional performance I have ever seen on a DVD.  Hogarth just leaves it all out there and you feel every lyric he sings.  Rothery and the band just slay it.  Rothery just caresses the guitar into submission time and time again.  He's truly a star.  And the crowd is so into it from the 'get go' it brings a tear to your eye.........and it did 4 or 5 times.  Yes I admit I did get abit misty a few times.  Well with the epic Gaza (It's just not FAIR!)  and the opening to Waiting to Happen where the crowd just takes over, and Hogarth wells up, it was all abit much.  This Strange Engine just blows my mind.  His efforts on Neverland got me again.  Seeing some females in the audience bawling their eyes out didn't help.  Power, STCBM and finally The Sky Above the Rain got me again.  ""Maybe they'll Taaaaallllkkkkkk""  Oh @#$%# it was all to much!!!!!  :( :( :( :(

Stunning, Brilliant and Mesmerizing.

Just get it Prog fans and you will die a happy man,  teary but happy. :-)))))))))))

8646754,5,B00IZ1ROE6,"Back in the day the only Marillion I knew was the one that used to be fronted by Fish and the only awareness I had about Fish was his first and so far his best solo album, Vigil In a Wilderness of Mirrors.  In fact, the only Marillion song I knew post-Vigil was the song Kayleigh, which in the day got a lot of play on select FM radio stations. But this is, of course, beside the point. I had read many favorable reviews of the Steve Hogarth H led Marillion and their latest album, Sounds That Cant Be Made.  I took a chance on it and thought it was an excellent example of neo-progressive music (as opposed to classic, e.g. Genesis and Yes style music). There was just enough melody and propulsive beats to make the journey from Track 1 to Track 8 worthwhile.
So, when the bands Blu Ray of the complete performance of the entire album (and other songs in the bands repertoire), recently became available I took another chance at it and on balance was pleased with what I found there. From the opening, 17-minute opus Gaza to their thunderous Strange Engine epic to the sublime Sky Above the Rain I was incredibly impressed by the groups musicianship. This is a band thats not just going through the motions, but absolutely and sincerely seem to want to deliver they very best performance every night. The guitar work, courtesy of Steve Rothery, is worth the price of admission alone. Surprisingly, I was not a big fan of the Fish-era numbers King of Sunset Town and Garden Party as they actually sounded dated compared to the rest of the set list that night. Technically speaking the camera work matched to the 5.1 soundtrack immerses viewers into the experience. No quick cuts here. The only criticism I have  and its similar to my (ahem), criticism of Jimi Hendrix is that H (much like Hendrix), seemed always to play (or in Hs case, sing) over the top, at the peak of the guitar or voices range. There is, so far as I can hear, not much nuance in Hs voice  its always shouting for the heavens, even in the more quiet passages. Again, its no big thing and his voice and the clarity and vigor he brings to each song is palpable. Still, I don't think it would be a bad thing for him to occasionally dial it back. On balance, if you are a Fish-era Marillion fan who wants to experience firsthand how the band has evolved and matured or if you're just a fan of progressive music and looking for something new, I highly recommend this Blu Ray of this performance. You won't be disappointed.",1407628800,5,2488,4.437636761487965
