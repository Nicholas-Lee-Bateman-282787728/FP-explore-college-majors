What do we have there?  A very good story, no cinematagraphy, terrible sound,and a very bad acting.  Not much, I would say, for a movie.  I was very disappointed.  I don't think John Malkovich is ready to produce movies.  He was not ready to be a good actor and now he is not ready to direct.  I say two out of two.",1052697600,4,479,3.757575757575758

1906250,5,B0000AGQ5V,After watching this stylish movie I'm quickly becoming a big Javier Bardem fan. He portrays a police investigator who is searching for a terror chieftain. He is doing so while also falling in love with his daughter's ballet teacher. Bardem's character seems to be living two lives as he warns even his small daughter not to tell anyone including her teacher what her father does for a living. I greatly enjoyed the police procedural aspects of this film that related to the search for the wanted terror boss.,1476403200,,508,4.784090909090909

The version sold by Amazon as an instant video product is at best a 3 star, and maybe a 2 star. The reason is that key parts of the plot are spoken in the language Quechua. On the DVD, the Quechua parts are subtitled in English. In the Amazon instant video version, the Quechua parts are simply labeled ""Native Language"" in the subtitles. These are IMPORTANT parts of the plot. You aren't getting the full story without them.

There are some plot issues but the acting makes up for the flaws.  I agree that it should have been done in Spanish with English (and other) subtitles.

1906291,5,B0000AGQ5V,"This magnificent film, starring the Spanish actor Javier Bardem, is simply an unexpectedly enchanting odyssey in cinema  despite the ever looming threat of violence in the revolutionary background of Latin America. This a tour de force performance both for Bardem, as the main protagonist, and for John Malkovich for his impressive Directorial Debut. What a marvelous accomplishment for them both! The film is carefully sculpted from the novel of the same name by Nicholas Shakespeare, a British writer caught in Peru at the time of the explosion of terrorism and violence brought about by the Shining Path guerrillas in the 1980s. Shakespeare, not only  lived through the madness but also actively sought the guerrillas themselves to understand their aims. Well deserving of his labors, he ended up writing the historic novel on his perilous experience, as well as penning the screenplay for this suspenseful movie. All of this is explained in the extra documentaries in the DVD. And never was this background documentary material most welcome by an audience!

The film is based on the sanguinary career of ""Comrade Gonzalo,"" the terrorist Professor of Philosophy, Abimael Guzman, who formed and led the Shining Path (Sendero Luminosa) Maoist guerrilla, one of the most sanguinary and notoriously violent terrorist groups, ever to seek anarchy and revolution through terror in Latin American history. The Shining Path indiscriminately killed public officials, as well as civilians in the town and native Peruvian Indians in rural areas. These poor Indians in remote areas only desired to be left alone, to till the soil and harvest their fields, refusing to join Gonzalo's (in the movie he is called ""El Presidente Ezequiel"") band of terrorists. Their aim was anarchy and violent revolution in the style of Mao Tse-tung, and they came close to winning, that is until President Alberto Fujimori (who is not in the film)empowered the military and appointed an investigative task force that sought and eventually found Gonzalo. The terrorist was hiding in the upstair apartment of a ballet dance teacher (who in real life was a communist agent trained in Cuba). The lawyer-turned policeman, Agustin Rejas (played by Bardem) doggedly pursuits Ezequiel but then falls in love with the dancer. He is torn between his duty to his country and his secret love for the ballet dancer he wants to believe is innocent. The movie even recreates the famous photograph of Abimael Guzman after his capture in his striped black and white prisoner outfit uniform secured in his cage as a wild man, being presented to the public and the media, held up in a crane presumably for his voyage to a high security prison (Sept. 24, 1992).

This is not a fast paced thriller, as American audiences are won't to watch, but a thoughtfully artistic film, thoroughly suspenseful by its own intrinsic pace, a pace carefully crafted by Malkovich to be savored slowly with gusto and finesse to the very end. This film is highly recommended with a 5 stars rating.

1906292,5,B0000AGQ5V,"I love Javier Bardem. Eventhough it was mostly in English, I still enjoyed it. This is all I want to say at this moment.",1390348800,,120,4.041666666666667
1906293,5,B0000AGQ5V,"In 2002 we are at the turning point of out understanding of what violence used for political objectives is: not revolution at all of any type, just plainly terrorism. But in These years of the beginning twenty-first century we were inheriting a whole set of misconceptions and deeply rooted movements all over the world that had been inspired by various brands of Marxist revolutionary tactics and strategies from the past. If you add to this set of Marxist or Maoist revolutionary movements the newly constituted al-Qaeda movement on a completely different ideological line but borrowing the methods of the previous movements plus some more spectacular ones, you have the situation around 2000-2002.

But it is a turning point in history that some will try to use to their political and electoral benefit if not profit, particularly in the USA. These radical theories and uses of violence to impose a change that is then, if not at once, hijacked by some power hungry people or movements are coming to an end. The world has changed and the technology of information and intelligence collecting and processing has changed so much that there is practically not one single spot in the world where anyone, not to mention a movement of any kind, can hide for long periods of time. If Bush had not tried to force history in Iraq after Afghanistan things would be a lot better today, but as I said before some could not resist playing politics with history. That will not change the outcome but that will slow down the process.

This film is dealing with that anti-terrorist action that has to be managed case by case, one after the other. There is not one single method for all cases but there must be one specific method for each case. Here we are in the Andes, probably in Peru where the fight is against the Shining Path Rebellion that organized hundred of small terrorist actions with a limited underground apparatus and a very limited number of leaders totally isolated or rather insulated against any security intelligence, or at least, so they say or think.

The method in this case is to track these leaders and little by little surround them and take them in one single operation; As soon as the movement is totally beheaded it peters out because there is no second line commanding unit that can take over.

Totally different would Al-Qaeda be because the top leadership has several hierarchical layers and it has been decentralized in the world with several regional, at times even local leaderships. To behead the top movement does not stop it because a new well trained leader steps into the shoes of the lost leader. And in the world the various regional branches are autonomous. Then they have to be weaned and their weapon or ammunition supplying routes have to be dried out or destroyed. It takes more time. Gaddafi's regime was brought down and he was a main provider of weapons to a whole set of movements and countries around Libya, but the arsenal was not destroyed or captured and then it moved across the desert and reappeared in Algeria, in Mali, now in Chad and Central Africa, probably in Sudan too, though it does not seem to go further. This explains why destroying the arsenal, chemical weapons first, of Syria is important. If it fell in extremist hands it might be used in any reckless way.

If you take the case of Sri Lanka, nothing was possible when the ceasefire was broken in 2006 if the sea was not under control. The USA provided the Sri Lankan government with the information that enabled the armed forces, navy and air force to sink all the ships that were supposed to supply the LTTE, an old Maoist-inspired movement. Then they had to control the sky and that was done by the destruction of the only important air strip the LTTE had. Planes and pilot training were provided by Ukraine and Russia. It was also necessary to have some satellite surveillance to track all movements and concentrations of vehicles and personnel on the ground, under the canopy of jungle vegetation. Though it has not been so far acknowledged, it is probably China who provided that support. And yet it took three years to defeat LTTE terrorism.

In Nepal the Maoist movement re-entered the political arena with a compromise that eliminated the feudal monarchy. In Myanmar the military dictatorship had to be pushed aside and democracy reestablished. That was done in a couple of years this time with strong international support of not pressure. In these cases it is the economic incentive that was the motor of such changes. The Chinese need to close up the violent Maoist movements in the world that are incompatible with their policy, their public image and the main commercial routes they want to re-open: the one across Tibet needs peace in Nepal. The one through Myanmar needs democracy there.

In the same way some entrenched communist, or ex-communist regimes have to open up to market economy to simply survive or remain independent. Laos is changing because of the enormous amount of electricity they now produce and mostly export, which gives them the money they need to develop the economy. Vietnam has to move fast along that line to follow the trend in Asia and to be at the spear head of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Even Thailand has been obliged to find a compromise to stabilize their politics.

Then you have some other situations that are also original. Colombia has to find a compromise with the rebellion (FARC) and at the same time with te unions at the head of working class action. Cuba has to find some compromise to manage its getting out of its impasse. And all other countries where violence had been a political argument and tool are finding political solution to balance the different sides and build a consensus for development and progress. In these countries the incentive is much more the danger of being cast out of history than just the economy. The only continent where things are still slightly messy is Africa, and not everywhere, far from it, with guerilla warfare here and there, Islamist movements in some other places and working class strife if not struggle in South Africa and some other more developed areas. The Middle East is more complex because of Bush's irrational meddling policy, not to speak of the global stakes that are attached to the oil and natural gas resources of this region.

But don't believe western countries do not have their brand of political terrorism. Marcel Gauchet in Paris is one the numerous theoreticians of network society in which everything has been connected into vast networks that are crisscrossing one another. The idea is to block one network or one section of one network to bring the whole society to a halt, forcing upon it a political crisis and thus a revolution. They have tried over the least ten years in France absolutely all options, and failed most of the time:
* universities (they succeeded once with a movement every nine fifteen months;
* harbors and oil refineries and they failed;
* highways with truck drivers unions and they failed;
* electricity or natural gas distribution but justice for one and the high-technological management for two brought them to a radical choice between action with casualties among the public and prison for the strikers or nothing and they chose nothing;
* airports, air traffic or air control and there they discovered that a Paris airport can be managed from Berlin or Rome and air transport is highly privatized and thus cannot be blocked;
* they have tried rail traffic too and they cannot block the system any more though it is one nationalized company;
* they have even tried sabotage (the last act of that sort was the injection of salt in the Blaye nuclear power station of December 8, 1995) on TGV lines, and that too has failed;
* telephone is entirely digital and has been privatized, hence it is impossible to block it, not to speak of satellite communication;
* they even tried emergency wards in hospital and it failed too.

And I have not enumerated everything. The list is long but since 1996 they have never been able to bring the country to a standstill.

That's what is behind this film, at least one case, and it is interesting to see it since the Shining Path Rebellion has been defeated in the meantime. So enjoy the film. The sound is not very good due to the cultivation, of some rather fake English accent to sound realistic in Latin America.

1906298,5,B0000AGQ5V,"This interesting story is based on actual efforts of Peruvian forces to battle the ""Shining Path"" Maoist insurrection that was launched in that country's Andean highlands. While most of the filming took place outside the country (Porto, Portugal, substitutes for Lima and highland Ecuador locations were used to resemble similar Peruvian terrain), the narrative does offer a reasonable facsimile of the decades long struggle to infiltrate and then suppress the bloody uprising. The revolutionary movement's mysterious and charismatic leader was finally discovered living secretly above a dance studio in the capitol (hence the title). Although the ""personal"" tale of the film's hero seems a bit artificially grafted onto the historical account, the understated, ""softer"" characterization which Javier Bardem brings to that role offers an interesting facet to his acting persona. The domestic scenes of that character's life and career also provide a revealing window into Peru's nascent middle class and the country's rigid social stratification - which helped fuel the long, violent insurrection.",1362182400,3,1097,5.736196319018405
1906299,3,B0000AGQ5V,"I loved this movie at the time of its theatrical release. I bought the book which I enjoyed even more and it prompted me to want to see the film again. But I had several problems. The Quechua was not translated, and the storyline, I think, suffered for it. Morante and Bardem's English accents were difficult to understand and the attraction between the two was not fleshed out. In the book,the main division between the policeman and his wife was that he was Indian, she was white; he was authentic to his inner code of ethics at the expense of his family and their upward mobility, she resented it. Additionally the wife was always trying to make the Indian looking daughter more white- taller, slimmer etc. The ballet teacher on the other hand accepted the little girl as she was and honored her ethnicity--thereby honoring Bardem's character's core/ essence as well.
I adore Morante as an actress but here she came across as winsome and weak--not someone to particularly inspire love. Otherwise, the hunt for the odious and deluded terrorist, based on philosophy professor Abimael Guzman who led the violent Maoist Sendero Luminoso in Peru, was well done.
I wish I could give it three and a half stars because, though flawed, it was a mature film on a serious topic, and I find that sorely lacking in a world where we are constantly bombarded with Hollywood's puerile output.",1361836800,3,1379,4.7740585774058575

The accents are heavy and most of the actors are soft-spoken, making it very difficult to hear everything that is being said. Also, there are several instances of Peruvian Indian dialect being spoken without subtitles offered to provide the audience insight into what is being said. Because this is a mystery/thriller, not being able to follow all the dialogue makes for an incomplete story and a frustrating experience as a viewer. If I could have understood 100% of the spoken story, I might have given this film 4-4.5 stars. As it is, it is not worth more than 3. Good luck!",1357171200,,715,4.774193548387097

1906308,5,B0000AGQ5V,"2003's ""The Dancer Upstairs"" is an underappreciated but very worthwhile departure from the standard movie drama.  It is a thinly fictionalized account of the pursuit of the murderous head of the Peruvian Maoist terrorist group Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path).  What could easily have been a flashy, violent thriller is, in Director John Malkovich's treatment, a slow-burning, richly textured movie centered on its characters and its location.

Javier Bardem is superb, and subtle, as a middle-aged detective charged with the pursuit of the leader of the terrorists.  His edge is a chance encounter with the otherwise faceless suspect many years earlier.  His methodical pursuit of a thin trail of clues is complicated by competition and corruption within the law enforcement community and by his own troubled personal life, not least his interest in his daughter's ballet teacher.

The movie's studiously even-handed presentation provides a textured look at the Peruvian society of the day, including our detective's uncertain links to his own Quechua heritage.  This approach may distract viewers looking for police procedural content, but it imparts significant emotional content to the ending of the movie.

This film,which has a very steamy cover to it with ""An Intense Thriller"" written at the bottom went no where very slowly. In the commentary, Malkovich says that he wanted to use actors who""have English as their second language"".WHY John? I would have preferred that this Latin American political piece be done in original language with subtitles. But then, Italian actress Laura Morante would have had to learn another language. Even Bardem did not seem to me totally comfortable inhabiting the role of Officer Rejas,even as fluent in English as he is.

here's the warnings:
1) the dancer doesn't live upstairs,
2) we never really see her dance,
3) the titillating partial-undress picture on the cover never occurs in the movie (hurray for PG-13 hopes for this vid),
4) the explosion scene on the cover is from a thrown-in scene and we don't even know who got blown up in that scene,
5) I guess this is a love story???  the weird thing about this is that hero-man is married and we don't see any marital problems other than the fact that wifey has a bit of a life outside waiting for stone-face to come home now and then,
6) another chick pops in 2x to flirt with our main man, but we don't know who she is, or if these two have ever done the sneaky-deed or what, and there's no follow-up to her character,
7) our main character's acting never gets over 10mph, except for one scene where some non-character soldier is obeying orders and starts to remove pinned-up drawings from our main-character's daughter.  ok, touching, but I thought this was a sleek espionage thriller, not a weepy father/daughter slice of life story!
8) a trailer comes up on the bottom of the screen early on and tells us this all happens in ""Central America"" ... shhhh!  don't tell anyone where it REALLY takes place, John!  give me a break!

1906320,4,B0000AGQ5V,"Augustin Rejas is a former attorney. Disillusioned, he has decided to join the police force in the hopes that he might obviate the rulings of a corrupt court system. Once he has established himself as an Investigator, he is ordered to assemble a small team and to look into a series of events that may or may not be the makings of united revolutionary activity. There are bombings, suicide bombings, assassinations, brown outs and other unmentionable acts of violence committed throughout this unnamed Latin American country. And the perpetrators are a seemingly random assembly of men, women and children, drawn, with no discernable criteria, from the indigenous poor, their Spanish-descended rulers and the buffering middle classes. The violence may occur at any moment, in any degree and from out of any direction; the tension is unbearable.

Inspector Rejas is a massive still presence. His principle investigative instruments are a fascination for fact, an impassive stare and an unrelenting deliberative nature. And with these, he does eventually determine the identity of the leader of this goalless revolution: a former university professor, known only as Ezekiel. But Ezekiel is an empty revelation: Rejas was never really looking for who but for why.

The Dancer Upstairs is commonly described as a political thriller--a misnomer that may dissuade you from recognizing it as a work of another and higher intellectual order. It is, rather, a meditation on the horror of things inexplicable. We are presented with a puzzling succession of events for which we, like Inspector Rejas, must provide an explicating narrative of some sort. Our motivation is the desire to repair the imbalance, to eliminate the random, violent variables that have wrecked our equation for the peace of meaning. The name ""Ezequiel"" seems to want to point to something, as do the slogans, the posters and the suicidal dedication of Ezequiel's followers. But they are only so many empty ciphers. And while the revelation is admittedly painful, we should remember that Inspector Rejas--the element of good with whom we will identify--is himself a kind of cipher: inexplicably strong, honest, determined. And he is--if for no ultimately satisfactory reason--a satisfactory counter to the damnable example of Ezequiel.",1112745600,19,2297,5.325068870523416

1906322,5,B0000AGQ5V,"I found this movie riveting, primarily because of the sensitive and unbelievably graceful performance by Javier Bardem as Agustin Rejas, the policeman whose job it is to capture the mysterious guerilla leader Ezequiel.  I  felt the political commentary almost  became secondary, because Bardem captures the screen with his beautiful, expressive face. His concentration on his job, his patience with his shallow wife, his love for his daughter..... all emotions are eloquently displayed, needing little dialogue.  When he does speak, his voice is soft and powerful.  Bardem lends a certain nobility to this role, and he really becomes Agustin.

His desire for the ballet teacher is palpable, yet he doesn't rush and is excruciatingly hesitant and tender, waiting for a response from her.

I thought Malkovich did a  pretty good job directing his first film, although sometimes the violence was a little gratuitous, and I was bothered by the ""scene switching"" that goes on occasionally. If a viewer wasn't ""up"" on the politics of the time, it could be very confusing. Interesting locations in Equador and Peru.  I'm kind of surprised that this film was in English, as almost all the actors are Spanish speaking . Bardem rises to the occasion with really fluent English with a charming Spanish accent.

This is not a movie for an audience looking for the typical Hollywood thriller and would be much too violent for those seeking a love story. The tension builds slowly as the police realize that years of apparently unrelated violence were in fact the beginnings of a revolution that is rapidly gathering steam. The violent acts become increasingly ominous as dead dogs are found hung from lampposts, schoolchildren gun down government officials, and the revolutionaries advertise their inevitable arrival in the capitol by staging power blackouts accompanied by surreal fireworks displays. The book and movie are very unusual but this is not an 'art' movie. It plays as a straightforward story of a hunt for the revolutionary leader with a subplot of the chief detective's growing love for his daughter's dance teacher.

1906325,4,B0000AGQ5V,"Nicholas Shakespeare, who wrote the screenplay of his novel, establishes in the opening scene the conflict between the ""common man"" and the government in an unnamed Latin American country.  Three adults, driving in their truck through the barren countryside, run down a soldier who tries to stop them at a checkpoint.  At a later checkpoint, they indicate that the bloodstains on the car are from a dead dog.  This imagery is further developed throughout the film--common people vs. authorized government, blood and the color red, and dead dogs, a symbol for those condemned to death.

Capt. Augustin Rejas (Javier Bardem), a lawyer turned policeman, is investigating a series of mysterious hangings of dogs, with signs affixed to their bodies, praising the mysterious Ezequiel, who may be inciting the countryside to a Maoist  revolution.  In further violence, dancers at an avant-garde performance kill a government official and his wife;  a child blows himself up, killing more officials;  and three mayors, eleven city councilors, and the Minister of the Interior are assassinated.  Rejas, an honest man, struggles to investigate as the corrupt military, controlled by an equally corrupt president, threatens to impose military rule.

Directed by John Malkovich, the film is impressionistic, giving the audience fragments of the ongoing action but not a coherent picture, requiring the viewer to draw conclusions, just as Rejas and his assistants do, in an effort to solve the terrorist mystery.  Since the dialogue is not always clear and the accents are strong, this is sometimes a difficult task. The cinematography (Jose Luis Alcaine), however, is dramatic and memorable, much of it focusing on architectural features--bridges, arches, jail cell bars, the bars of a fire escape, columns, balconies.  The color red (symbolizing blood throughout) is used to powerful effect in virtually all the key scenes.

Though Bardem and the rest of the Latin American cast are effective in conveying the tension of time and place, the film is sometimes difficult to follow, and the exact nature of the relationships is not always clear.  Nevertheless, the film makes its point about the nature of government and political movements and succeeds in showing Rejas (Bardem) as a rounded character, trying to keep his family happy, trying to find happiness himself, and trying to bring honor to his job.  The music is sparse but used effectively and sometimes symbolically, especially at the beginning of the film, where happy, syncopated accordian music is gradually transformed into dark, eerie harmonies, the syncopation kept intact.  Thoughtful and complex, the film highlights some of the competing interests of Third World governments.  Mary Whipple",1096416000,7,2746,5.363636363636363

1906337,4,B0000AGQ5V,"In ""The Dancer Upstairs,"" John Malkovich delivers a complex, moody crime drama set in a Latin American city.  Ambivalent police captain Rejas (Javier Bardem) is assigned to track down Ezequiel, an elusive revolutionary terrorist, and his followers.  As explosions rage around the city, Rejas and his team race to discover the identity of their man.  Unlike an ordinary cop drama, the film gives Rejas's personal life weight.  He is caught in a listless marriage and falls in love with his daughter's ballet teacher Yolanda, well played by Laura Morante.  In this film, however, nothing is cut-and-dried, and even Rejas's emotional attachment to Yolanda has its dark twists.
Although the plot itself is suspenseful, much of the tension in this film is created through cinematography and directorial decisions - close-ups, shots of the setting, the use of color, the spare music.  The acting is understated, making the few outbursts explosive in context.  Bardem has so carefully drawn his character under his skin that he conveys a range of emotions through his expressions and gestures, giving his character a subtly only gifted actors can achieve.
My biggest complaint about this film was the heavily accented actors speaking in English.  I'm sure I missed some of the complexity simply because I couldn't understand all of what was being said.  I would have much preferred a Spanish language film with subtitles, an appropriate choice given the setting and the performers. It has all the feel of a foreign film, so why not go all the way?

When you have low expectations, it's impossible to be disappointed unless you were hoping your low expectations were unfounded and then you really didn't have low expectations did you? Think of it like a blind date. If you expect a HUNK or a BABE, you might end up deflated. The two other possible results including the flip side are obvious, you either got what you expected or you are elated. Either is infinitely better than being deflated.
Let's talk about my blind date with The Dancer Upstairs.
Well, I certainly had low expectations for The Dancer Upstairs, a movie I had never heard of, with a cast, of which whose members, I had never heard, so starting at the bottom we had nowhere to go but up. Kind of like being guilty until proven innocent.
THE DANCER UPSTAIRS
I think of this movie as one of the so called artsy films. One thing you can say about artsy films if I may state the obvious is that they are either very good or very bad. Seldom are they in between. The Dancer Upstairs was a BABE.
Main Characters:
Javier Bardem ... Det. Lt. Agustn Rejas
Juan Diego Botto ... Det. Sgt. Sucre
Laura Morante ... Yolanda
Elvira Mnguez ... Det. Llosa
Alexandra Lencastre ... Sylvina Rejas
Oliver Cotton ... Police Chief Merino
All Star cast right? Well don't let the names fool you they all did first rate jobs.
Plot:
The story takes place in an undisclosed Latin American Country that is undergoing chronic sustained terrorist attacks from Marx-Leninist guerillas whose leader, Ezequiel, fancies himself as the fourth prophet of Communism, (Shinnig Path?) the others being Marx, Lenin, and Mao. Ezequiel, though he is the subject of the movie, is really only in two scenes in the movie, in the beginning and near the end.
Our hero, Det. Lt. Agustn Rejas (Javier Bardem)is put in charge of the task force, charged with the capture of the elusive guerilla leader. Rejas, an ex lawyer turned police detective is given an ultimatum of sorts, a short period of time to effect his assignment or marshal law would be enacted. As it is, a trio of terrorist bombs triggered marshal law anyway, wherein the army assumed the investigation and took all gathered evidence and notes.
The movie also depicted Rejas the family man. He is married with a young teenage daughter Marina. She is an aspiring ballerina whose teacher, Yolanda (Laura Morante)is the Dancer Upstairs of the title. Rejas, whose marriage seems to be one of mutual respect with little passion, is drawn to the interesting and lovely dance instructor and she to him but something seems to be holding her back.
I found The Dancer Upstairs, to be interesting (in a historical way), provocative (provoking thought)and quite enjoyable. True, it is not a world beater but it was well presented and directed and something I should mention is that the only connection of this movie to Hollywood was the Director, John Malkovich in his directorial debut. After refusing directing oppurtuities for many years, Malkovich was so enamored with the 1997 Nicolas Shakspeare book, that he produced and directed this gem. Malkovich even went so far as to have Shakespeare write the screenplay.
The acting was very good, though not overly emotional. the actors were well cast and did a very realistic portrayals of their respective characters. Lead actor, Javier Bardem reminds me of Stacy Keach both in looks and acting styles, Rejas' sidekick Sucre, was played by a dashing, personable actor named Juan Diego Botto. I'm sure we'll be hearing more of him in the future. Lead and supporting actresses,
Laura Morante and Elvira Mnguez also did credible work Morante as the Dancer and Minuez as one of the task force though her part was fairly small.

  How does one function as a cop in a place where the rule of law can vanish in an instant? That's the central question of this film, impressively directed by John Malkovich. Bardem (a very fine tightly wound performance), doesn't know whom he can trust, but is unable to articulate his inner conflict. He edges towards romance with the ballet teacher, but events catch up to them. I enjoyed the unfamiliar setting, which Malkovich uses like a native, and the mood of impending chaos that pervades much of the film.

It completely parts with the typical left-wing view of Latin America where the terrorists are enobolized and everyone else is either corrupt or stupid.  For anyone who has spent time studying terrorism around the world and in particular in Latin America this movie comes very close to describing reality.  First, the United States and Europe aren't the only places where there are thinking, professional police detectives.  Commit a crime in many Latin countries and they will hunt you down.  Secondly, terrorists are in the end the ultimate in corruption and evil.  Blind followers of Castro, the Sandanistas, Che Gueverra, etc will get a glimpse at their cowardly arrogance and murderous ways.

So, all the action in this movie centres on an abstract character, a ghost. The search in itself is then the main theme of the movie. Not very interesting, if you ask me.

1906343,3,B0000AGQ5V,"Actor John Malkovich makes an auspicious directorial debut with ""The Dancer Upstairs,"" an intriguing, if not altogether satisfying, police procedural set in an unnamed Latin American country.
Javier Bardem (""Night Must Fall"") gives a richly textured performance as Detective Augustin Rejas, a man of principle and ethics operating in a world of corruption and violence.  Rejas finds himself embroiled in a life-and-death mystery when he investigates an underground terrorist organization that is targeting key government officials for assassination.  Who these people are is not at all clear to those in charge and even their motives can only be guessed at.  As Rejas studies the clues in search of answers, he becomes drawn to a beautiful young dance teacher with whom he establishes a platonic yet highly charged romantic relationship.  It is in the bringing together of these two seemingly disparate plot lines that the movie fails, ultimately, to satisfy.  For roughly the first three quarters of the film, as Rejas collects his evidence and unravels the puzzle, we gladly go along where the filmmakers are taking us, fascinated by the setting, the atmosphere and the contemporary relevance of the terrorism theme.  But when, towards the end, the story kicks into high tragedy mode, the movie loses us, partly because the plotting itself is not particularly credible and partly because the relationship between Rejas and the woman has not been sufficiently developed to achieve the status of genuine tragedy.  The film is much better when it sticks to the business of the case and leaves all the existential navel-gazing out of the mix.
This is not to demean either the moving, beautifully modulated performance of Bardem or the stark, self-assured direction of Malkovich, who shows he knows how to function as well behind the camera as he does in front.  True, the film is a trifle slow at times but this just shows that Malkovich will not be rushed when the material itself demands deliberation and care.  Although the movie is about a half hour too long, real languor begins to set in only during the final stretches.  Until then, ""The Dancer Upstairs"" makes for rewarding viewing.",1073088000,12,2188,5.120786516853933
1906354,5,B0000AGQ5V,"Many viewers simply didn't *get* this movie.
These are the folks who called it slow, too restrained, confusing.
For the thinking viewer, this movie is not slow, and it is not confusing.  It is a visual feast that leaves the mind, and soul, reeling; it is a puzzle that stays unfinished just long enough to make its points, and then closes with a heartbreakingly poignant finale.
It is a tightly plotted, emotionally moving film that can be taken on several levels: as a political thriller, as a police procedural, as a meditation on the pleasures of domestic life v. extramarital passion.
Most powerfully, though, this film talks about, and parallels, explosions -- the explosions of art, of politics, of terrorism, and of passion -- v. restraint. The restraint, for example, of a good man trying to live a decent life in a broken world.
It's hard to talk about this film's most brilliant moments without giving away the whole plot, and that you don't want to do, because this movie's surprises are well worth it.
But one can say -- watch how Malkovich uses the color red. Watch how he uses bars, as if the bars of a cage, when shooting Javier Bardem.  Notice parallels, including in a scene where a young girl dances before a series of reflecting mirrors. Note the music she dances to.  Notice who is the sole person ever to have photographed a certain elusive terrorist.
Note references to Kant, most famous for his ""Critique of Pure Reason.""
No, this film is no art house puzzle.  But it does offer more than the pure pleasure and visual excitement of a nail biting political thriller, which it offers as well.
It offers us food for thought about one of the biggest issues of the day -- terrorism.
Is it ever right, this film asks, to give in to one's momentary passion and explode, either literally or metaphorically, when confronted with a variety of stimuli, from finding the love of your life, even if you're married to someone else, to having your coffee plantation seized by government troops?
And, what kind of person has something in common with a terrorist, anyway?  The answer the film offers might surprise you.
I loved this movie. I wish more of my fellow viewers had gotten it. This film, in addition to being simply beautiful and entertaining, sets before us some of the biggest questions of the day.
Finally, Bardem's performance, a masterpiece of restrained passion and thought, is not to be missed.

1906355,5,B0000AGQ5V,"John Malkovich's directorial debut is one of the best films I saw this year. A superb screenplay by fellow first-timer Nicholas Shakespeare (adapting his own novel) with a marvellously sophisticated central character is only the starting point. As you might expect, performance is foregrounded here and Malkovich gets stunning turns from his cast - Javier Bardem, in particular, is heart-breakingly good as the morally-fraught lawyer/detective - and Malkovich clearly knows how to set up his shots. This doesn't look like the directorial debut of an actor who loves the stage. It looks like the work of a born filmmaker who knows precisely what he wants and how to get it. But the real triumph of this film is that it tells a story combining action, romance and political intrigue, without for an instant feeling like the childish Hollywood pap which usually results from that recipe. This is mature, sophisticated storytelling that doesn't treat its audience like popcorn-guzzling idiots looking to be entertained. And yet it does entertain. It maintains a poignancy entirely appropriate to its subject matter, while still managing to be an engaging political thriller. That's quite an achievement. One of the most effective elements of this film is the music, or rather the lack of it. There are, from memory, only three moments when music is used in this film - and its magical every time. It makes you realise how music is usually so over-used as a cheap way of wringing emotion from badly written or badly acted scenes, and how much more REAL the tension and violence and romance can seem without it. It also shows you how effective music can be when used sparingly. The two songs Malkovich chose for this film are beautiful in their own right, yet their deployment is nothing short of spine-tingling. Overall, this a brilliant piece of filmmaking that deserves a place in everyone's DVD collection.  Of course there's no soundtrack, so if you want the two songs go grab yourself a copy of Yul Anderson's album ""Wind Starlight"" for his stunning version of 'All Along the Watchtower', and Nina Simone's ""Emergency Ward / It Is Finished / Black Gold"" or ""Nina Simone Anthology"" for 'Who Knows Where the Time Goes?'.

I was completely taken aback by this film because it was not at all what I expected from John Malkovich.  This is a gentle film about the human capacity for perversity (the film prefers ""corruption""); the contrast between the gentleness of the tone and the violence of the acts cannot be unintentional.

Then, too, the terrorists are mistaken for ""normal"" people and so we see them as normal people before we see them as terrorists.  Malkovitch has taken on one of the most sacred of American film conventions: the bad guys wear black hats so the audience can identify them and they are all bad all the time so the audience knows who to hate.  Americans never want to admit we take an extremely realisitic art medium and impose upon it completely unrealistic story conventions.  The eye is fooled and the mind blinded.

Wouldn't life be grand if the terrorists wore black hats so we could identify them?  We'd know just who to blame for everything.

But what if individual terrorists are made by governmental terrorism?  Isn't it significant that most of the 911 terrorists are Saudis?

I expected a ironic, sarcastic, ""hipper than thou"" annoyance but I saw a genuine, even romantic (gasp), film which moved me to tears.

And then I realized that it John Malkovich's performance that was the heart of ""Dangerous Liaisons,"" not Glenn Close's or Michelle Pfeiffer's.  Ahhhhh . . .",1068336000,8,1663,4.847517730496454

1906360,1,B0000AGQ5V,"On the surface, this is the kind of film I usually like.  It's set in an unnamed South American country.  It's about terrorism.  And it has all the off-beat twists and turns to be expected in an independent film.  And, by the way, it's directed by John Malkovich.
The story is about a policeman, played by Javier Bardem.  He's such a good guy that he even gave up his practice of law because he hated the corruption.  He's also a member of an indigenous Indian people and, in a scene or two, he speaks the native tongue to show how ""ethnic"" he is.  Considering the fact that he's a dedicated and non-corrupt police officer, he lives a pretty good life.  His wife is a bit of an airhead, dresses in the latest fashions and wants to have plastic surgery done on her nose.  His daughter takes ballet classes.
The terrorists start doing bad things.  Children with terrorist fervor blow themselves up in crowded marketplaces.  Dogs are murdered and strung up on lampposts.  Everyone is frightened and martial law takes over.  And then our hero starts an affair with his daughter's ballet teacher.
Why did this film  have to be in English?  And why are there so many unresolved details?  And, most of all, why did I keep falling asleep?
Sorry folks, I just didn't like this film.  And I can't recommend it at all.",1066348800,6,1307,4.517094017094017
1906361,4,B0000AGQ5V,"In an unnamed Latin American nation, random acts of violence have been shattering the countryside's peace for 5 years. For a while the incidents seemed unconnected and were blamed on a variety of activist organizations. Then dead dogs displaying signs proclaiming ""Long Live Ezequiel"" start turning up hanging from lampposts around the nation's capital. Detective Lieutenant Augustin Rejas (Javier Bardem) is given a team of 4 police officers and assigned the task of discovering Ezequiel's identity and dismantling his violent organization. But before he can make much progress, the organization assassinates a government minister. Fearing the beginnings of a revolution, the nation's president declares martial law. Although Rejas is permitted to continue with his investigation, any person his team investigates is taken into military custody and deprived of due process. Frustrated by the lack of justice in his professional life and with a wife with whom he has little in common at home, Rejas seeks the companionship of his daughter's ballet teacher, Yolanda (Laura Morante), a woman who seems at first to share his soulful nature.
""The Dancer Upstairs"" is based on the novel of the same name by Nicholas Shakespeare, who also wrote the film's screenplay. It is the first film directed by actor (and director of theater) John Malkovich. The film is timely in its depiction of terrorism as a socio-political force and military law as a purported protection from it. The extremely violent ""Ezequiel"" revolutionaries were obviously inspired by ""The Shining Path"" organization which terrorized Peru during the 1980s and 1990s. But ""The Dancer Upstairs"" is pretty light-handed with its socio-political statements. We see events unfold from the perspective of Augustin Rejas, who is a reluctant police officer, a man of no professional ambition who only wants to live in a just society. He is saddened by his president's paranoia and the nation's return to martial law. But his own decision-making isn't flawless. The film's pace might best be described as contemplative. It directly reflects Rejas' personality and the tempo of the countryside from which he came and with which he still has great affinity. The film meanders a bit and at times seems to have  no clear direction. I don't believe this is a flaw though. The story is definitely moving toward its conclusion. It just isn't taking the direct route. This will probably rack the nerves of viewers who are expecting a traditional police drama. Cinematographer Jose Luis Alcaine has created some beautiful and painterly images. He contributes to the film's contemplative mood by pausing on these images long enough for us to take them in. I found a scene in which children carrying large posters scatter in the street at night to be especially beautiful and rather startling. I was grateful to Alcaine and to the film's editor for giving me enough time to look at it. John Malkovich has chosen a difficult adaptation for his directorial debut. ""The Dancer Upstairs"" has a kind of thematic and narrative obscurity that won't appeal to everyone. I found it to be a memorable film, though, and Javier Bardem is well-cast as the gentle and soulful police detective. The film's biggest fault is that the dialogue is occasionally difficult to understand. The cast is comprised entirely -and understandably- of Spanish and Latin American actors. But the film is in English. While some of the actors speak virtually accent-less English, others can be difficult to decipher.",1064880000,16,3524,5.204225352112676
1906362,5,B0000AGQ5V,"THE DANCER UPSTAIRS is a fine example of how films conceived and produced by this country can have all the qualities we honor (and hunger for) in foreign films.  Based on true events in the late 1980's in Peru, THE DANCER UPSTAIRS is adapted for the screen from the novel by the same name by the author - Nicholas Shakespeare.  The story itself is one of extremes in terror, murder, heinous crimes, and all that is associated with terroist activities in a revolutionary framework.  Yet Shakespeare has written a screenplay that focuses more on minds of his characters than on their acts.  The 'revolutionary' is a professor of philosophy and his nemesis, tracing his identity and capture, is a thinking man's policeman - a lawyer who turned in his black robes to find a better way to discover honesty.  Although Malkovich does not spare images that convey the atrocities (children as suicide bombers, slaughtered dogs hanging from the street lamps, mafia-style executions), he does not dwell on them but rather focuses on the impact on the mind of his lead detective.  Javier Bardem is the lead actor here and surpasses his previous successes by demonstrating that he is a 'work in progress' - an actor who grows with every difficult assignment he encounters.  His sidekick is well acted by Juan Diego Botto, an actor who knows the subtlties of 'supporting role'.  The lead women actors, Laura Morente(as the dancer of the title) and Alexandra Lancastre (as Bardem's wife), are as subtle as they are beautiful, making us believe in the inevitable proof of Bardem's human frailty as he forges his imperturable trail toward justice.
The accompanying featurettes are involving conversations and commentaries by Nicholas Shakespeare (who actually lived in Lima, Peru while the 'Shining Path' revolution he describes actually was taking place), by John Malkovich regarding his choices of electing to cast his film with an entirely Spanish speaking crew yet speaking in English and for not naming the country or the particular timeframe of the story which he hopes will make the story more a parable than a docudrama, and by Javier Bardem who addresses the difficulties of keeping his character cerebral. And for once these features truly enhance the film's message.
It is refreshing to know that movies of this caliber exist and that, hopefully, Malkovich will continue his brave stance as a director of consummate taste and subtlety. Highly Recommended, but be prepared to think.",1064361600,27,2475,5.049019607843137

Having lived there for quite some time, and at time when the country I lived in was under martial law, he did an excellent job of conveying the unmistakable mix of beauty in the midst of serious repression.
If I had one complaint, it would be Javier Bardem's character. It was hard to understand what compelled him to pursue his daughter's dance teacher and his perserverance in seeking out the terrorist Ezequiel.  There were too few clues about his past to explain this drive satisfactorily, especially at the end of the movie (spoiler alert!!) when it becomes clear that the dance teacher is caught up in the irrational support of Ezequiel and is repulsed by Bardem.",1057536000,2,833,4.804195804195804

The actor who portrays the official is convincing, and a most attractive figure, as are his associates.  There are authentic scenarios, even if shot in Ecuador, Spain, and Portugal.  The use of Quechua in key places (with English sub-titles) added to the authenticity of the film.
The  film is a captivating adventure that takes the viewer deep into the urban and rural living zones of South America, and like a mystery novel it is difficult to anticipate what is coming next and final outcomes.

1906366,4,B0000AGQ5V,"THE DANCER UPSTAIRS is the perfect film for these times, when violence against societies comes less from declared wars between nation-states and more from shadowy international terrorist groups - or ""freedom fighters"", depending on your perspective.
Captain Augustin Rejas (Javier Bardem) is an officer in the police force that serves the capital of an unspecified Latin American country in the throes of an undeclared civil war. In the name of a mysterious ""Ezequiel"", random assassinations and bombings are being inflicted. Nobody is safe, from government officials in limos to common citizens on the street. In the most dramatic episode, teenage school girls gun down a general and his bodyguards. Yet no proclamation of revolution is forthcoming, and no group takes ""credit"" for the violence. Rejas is given command of an anti-terrorist team to track Ezequiel down before the army must be called in and martial law declared. The foundations of the society are being eroded as if by an invisible acid.
In the midst of the turmoil, Augustin continues to take his young daughter to her ballet lessons, which are conducted by Yolanda (Laura Morante), THE DANCER UPSTAIRS, who lives above the school.
This is a film that barely made it out of the art houses because it isn't a mass-appeal thriller. The audience sees no plethora of special FX, no edge-of-your-seat pursuits, and the plot twist, when it comes, is almost anticlimactic. And the hero, Rejas, is no Bond. He's just a regular guy, who trudges through his daily 9 to 5 and is vaguely dissatisfied with his marriage to a woman whose obsession is with having a nose job. His is a life approaching quiet desperation, and Yolanda is a spark that could perhaps rekindle a fire.
While the action is low key, the cinematography lovingly captures  the country's slide into chaos. The fireworks are an ominous, yet inspired, touch. Both Bardem and Morante keep perfect pace with the tenor of the piece and the director's vision, neither over or under-acting their respective roles. Perhaps my only complaint is that Augustin's revelation, when it comes, and its aftermath, are consistent with the almost too subdued nature of the script. I wanted more passion.
For those enough lucky enough to live in a stable society, THE DANCER UPSTAIRS is a disquieting glimpse across the boundary of stability.",1054771200,5,2349,5.054123711340206

1906369,4,B0000AGQ5V,"I was hesitant to see John Malkovich's ""The Dancer Upstairs,"" a movie I thought I would love, because it has really been slammed pretty good in the press.
Well, I saw it and did indeed love it.  Now I'm wondering what the heck the press was looking for that I might have missed.  For anyone who knows the story of Abimael Guzman and Peru's Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path), the story clicks over and over again with the recognition of thinly disguised details of that real case.
Like ""Dancer's"" mysterious ""Presidente Ezequiel,"" Guzman hid in plain sight right in the middle of Lima and conducted his countryside revolution from within the capital city's borders.  And, like Ezequiel, Guzamn was protected by a network of surprisingly mainstream supporters.
One caveat to my vote for this movie:  I'm a big Javier Bardem fan.  I've seen most of his films.  He's excellent here again, even as he sometimes struggles with the language.  [You can almost hear him sound out some sentences phonetically.]
And that brings up the language issue.  Malkovich here goes the route popularized by Julian Schnaebel's ""Before Night Falls,"" in that Spanish-accented English is substituted for what, in reality, should be Spanish.  This worked well for Schnaebel, with Bardem perfectly capturing Reinaldo Arenas' essence even in Cuban-inflected English.
Here, the effect is not as good, as Quecha is introduced to converse with the nameless country's Indian population, then flipping back to English to simulate Spanish.  All very odd, especially when Bardem's very Chicano-like partner throws in riffs taken from Anita Hill's classic denunciation of Clarence Thomas (talk about an odd, dated cultural reference).",1053993600,12,1696,5.2250922509225095

John M. has always been spooky to me , he likes those dark and ""Ha, Ha, bet you cannot figure me out"" characters in most of his movies. But, if this is his Directorial debut, he has not much to offer his fans.

1906371,3,B0000AGQ5V,"An interesting choice of subject from Malkovich for a directorial debut. When Nina Simone started crooning ""Who Knows Where the Time Goes"" in the first few reels I revelled in the choice of music hoping it would be reflective of the director's taste in general, and braced myself for an exquisite movie from an exquisite actor. Unfortunately, in its totality, this movie fell short of my (possibly high) expectations. Let me elaborate.
The premise is noble: a political thriller with a romantic undercurrent based on Nicolas Shakespeare's eponymous novel that veers around the ""sendero luminoso"" (shining path) maoist insurgency in Peru. The indigenous Peruvian life is in distress, there is acute economic disparity across social groups (lots of wealth in few hands), lawyers drive cabs, policemen moonlight to make ends meet. This calls for a revolution against the tyrannical government that is busy mercilessly abandoning its people. Abimael Guzman, an eccentric philosophy teacher with a penchant for women guides the coup(s). Somewhat paradoxical that such blood and gore had to be the expression of a righteous cause but the professor still needs to be brought to book. Couched in all this mayhem, a simple love-story between a policeman Rejas (who's hunting for the crazed professor) and a dance teacher.
Sounds so promising! But..
WHAT'S BAD --- Be prepared for longueurs tinged with overdramatized nuances like drawn-out looks at hanging bloody dead dogs or a number of close-ups of people (including children) being destroyed by explosions and/or numerous gunshots. The movie is in English, which may dismay some viewers but it was due to financial reasons (part of the movie was funded by Telefonica, the spanish telecom giant, but English means larger audiences and some extra dough so let's get over linguistic judgments).
WHAT'S GOOD --- The soundtrack, they really should release it as a separate album. The cinematography is intimate and moving, but I would stop short of saying that it was deeply compelling. Javier Barclem's acting is marvellous, from simple eye gestures to the nuances of countenance. He commented about the character of Rejas being guided by ""duty rather than obsession"". This honestly comes off pretty well in the movie and is refreshing in the face of all the obsession we see depicted in Hollywood...people *can* be exceptional and interesting in what they do and still have time to wash their clothes or scramble eggs for their daughter in the morning.
OVERALL -- I reckon it will might go down very well with people who hold Peru dear in their hearts but I found the narrative being somewhat grating under its lumbering pace and art-movie stylization. If Malkovich was gunning for an award (and the screenplay clearly betrays such a tack) I bet he had Cannes in mind instead of Oscars. You get the idea.
Btw, if you get smitten by the soundtrack as I am, you should be looking for the Spanish name of the movie, ""Pasos De Baile"".",1053734400,12,2972,5.054989816700611
1906372,4,B0000AGQ5V,"This film has generated a lot of negative reviews by people who are blinded by their conception of ""typical"" plot structures.
Important in this film is not the primary plot about a terrorist group starting a revolution in a Latin American nation, but about one man, the policeman hunting down the terrorist leader.  Unlike a film like Se7en, in which the hunt is as enthralling as the personal struggle of the protaganist, thus giving the casual film goer their eye-candy, in this film the hunt serves only to illuminate the feelings Rejas.  He is alienated from a corrupt system, alienated from his shallow wife, and he has found solace in the artistic purity of his daughter and her dance instructor.
This film is not for someone looking for a taut political thriller or police cat-and-mouse game.  It's a character study more like In the Bedroom than a police movie like Se7en.
The cinematography is excellent, and the locations that Malkovich chose to shoot perfectly fit the mood of the film.

1906373,1,B0000AGQ5V,"...why is it called ""The Dancer UPstairs"" when the ballet teacher lives in the basement?
This is a fine example of folks marketing a movie as though it were about one thing when it is about quite another thing. Look at the lobby card poster--a woman's bare back, evocative of a cello, draped by red material. Look at the trailer, which I must have seen five times: ballet dancer woman going thru her moves, a glimpse of a red skirt spinning round and round, fireworks in the sky as a couple view them from a rooftop. Seems like a...romance?
Wrong.
It's actually a nasty rebellion-against-the-government movie. Dead dogs hanging all over the place with placards attached to them. Folks have their faces blown off. And actors so bad, they can't even begin to say their improbable lines believably. The absolute worst one is the protagonist's superior officer--stinkeroo, boy. He belongs in camp movies because he is terrible. Also, his brows were so brooding and shadow casting, that he appeared to have no eyes. Really! Check it out (if you want to waste the money) and see for yourself. When the lights came up, the first thing I heard was another audience member blurt out, ""Well, that sure was a disappointment!""
Another reviewer was right that there was no motivation for the main character Rejas to form an attachment to the dancer-in-the- basement. His homelife seemed fine to me. I guess she was supposed to be more ""real"" than his wife, who was dyed blonde and wanted a rhinoplasty. The d-in-the-b was a natural brunette forever clad in a danskin, you see. But if 15% of the movie was about this plot element, that was a lot.
Something else that was contrived was the mixed use of Spanish and English in the movie. I think the directorial concept was, ""Hey, since we're in a South American location, anything that's ever written down, has to be in Spanish...even if the actors themselves are speaking English."" I first noticed this when Rejas and his daughter are  helping his wife with her speech. The mother is reading from index cards we can't see, speaking in English. However, the kid is holding up giant cards with Spanish words written on them. I mean, that just looked stupid. If Malkovich felt he wanted to be authentic, then he should have had everyone SPEAK Spanish and have subtitles. Most of the people who would go to see this will be able to read. But you see, some of the actors (like the aforementioned stinky superior officer) have no Spanish accent anyway because I don't think they were hispanic to start with. So, this was all just dishonest, wasn't it?
A final piece of pure nonsense was that, when it's all under control and the perpetrators have been sentenced, Rejas asks for clemency. Sorry, there's just no way that a policeman who had seen as much bloodshed as this guy had over this issue would ever ask for the criminals to be treated nicely. That's just ludicrous.
SO, although viewers might enter the theatre because of that back of the mysterious woman, they will find in the all-too-appropriate words of one character, ""All he is, is a fat man in a cardigan.""
