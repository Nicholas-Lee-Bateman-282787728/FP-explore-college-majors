7810275,5,6301228197,"It's your first Kiss, Charlie Brown (1977): Homecoming Time! Football Game, Dancing, Partying, the works! Right in the middle is Charlie Brown. Not only is he playing in a football game, he the escort for the queen. GOOD GRIEF! The queen is none other then The Little Red-Haired Girl (Who is finally given a name!) At the game, Peppermint Patty is the Coach/QB and Snoopy is the Referee. Charlie Brown is the kicker and Lucy is the holder. Mistakes happen and guess who is blamed! At the dance, Charlie Brown is very nervous. This is the first time he is going to meet her. (Find out what happens after!)",1041984000,,604,4.5504587155963305

Apparently, she's so stupid she thinks humilating Charlie Brown is more important than winning the Homecoming Game! As the biggest Peanuts fan, I've always despised her. When Lucy said she wouldn't once, because it was an important game. Well, than why didn't she hold it the other times? Them losing is so inevitable with that pinhead Lucy holding the ball. Not only that, but after she pulls it away, Charlie Brown lands on his back, is attacked by players and critized by Peppermint Patty, when its obvious Lucy is at fault! Then at the ceremony, Frieda,Lucy,and Pepprmint Patty(am I right on that?) are critizing Charlie Brown. Lucy did it and she's there critizing him. So, she pulls the ball away, lets Charlie Brown get physically and emotionally hurt, lets her whole team(and school)down and critizes Charlie Brown later, and no one is mad at her? The only thing that saves this junk from a 1 star rating is the fact that at least the little-red haired girl did you know what. But Charlie Brown doesn't even remember it. Talk about a ripoff!",1006300800,2,1213,4.672897196261682
