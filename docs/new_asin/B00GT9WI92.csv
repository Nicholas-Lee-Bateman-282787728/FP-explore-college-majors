8627345,4,B00GT9WI92,I was pleasantly surprised by this film's good acting and writing.  I can see why she won an award for her role; they all did a great job and the film was a realistic slice of life.,1405641600,,181,3.891891891891892
8627346,5,B00GT9WI92,"From the beginning, I was hooked, although I have never been on drugs or enabled anyone else in that hellish habit. I do not use the word ""hellish"" lightly, and, in fact, I do not curse period; but I don't know how else to describe the condition of both the mother and daughter in this horrible set of circumstances. Both actresses were superb in their roles; they eclipsed everything else about the movie. The male lead was also good, but could not really compare to the mother's role and all the intricacies of her entanglements and reactions and interactions. I don't know why I had missed the movie, but I honestly had never heard of it until I ran across it while browsing. I'm glad to have found it. I felt pity, anger, love, desolation, and all manner of emotions while watching. Both the mother and daughter appeared trapped by each other, and the resolution (if there really was any) was not for the faint of heart and mind. There was, however, a certain beauty in the last scene that really came as a shock. It was as if one had come full circle and found oneself.",1400630400,,1074,4.456852791878172
8627347,5,B00GT9WI92,"sweet moving funny HUMAN story. Entertaining and heartfelt! What independent filmmaking is all about; great writing, direction, performances. Loved it!",1400284800,,151,6.6
8627348,3,B00GT9WI92,"The mother is very co-dependant and enabled her daughter too much in her prescription drug addiction.  Good to watch one time,  but no more than once.",1398816000,,150,4.730769230769231
8627349,4,B00GT9WI92,This movie was very realistic. It shows how codependency can enable an addict. It also shows how addiction not only drags the person down with the disease but family and friends too. I would recommend anyone to watch this. Some times you can't see the forest through the trees but this film may help someone recognize problems in their own lives or someone that they are close to.,1395792000,,380,4.602941176470588
