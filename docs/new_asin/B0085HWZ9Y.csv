5133218,4,B0085HWZ9Y,"It's a no-brainer that any Robert Plant fan must get this dvd.  If you've seen a show on the tour, you know this is stellar stuff.  What is somewhat disappointing however is that the release is from The Artists Den series (no slight on them) and not from a regular show or series of shows from Robert's tour.  That setlist is shorter than a regular tour show and omits several BOJ songs such as You Can't Buy My Love, Monkey, Silver Rider, and Harms Swift Way.  While there was some variation in setlists throughout the tour, he also performed Tall Cool One.  So I think this release could have been better, but on the bright side at least something was released.",1342137600,5,663,4.446280991735537
5133219,5,B0085HWZ9Y,"For the last twelve years Plant has been very active, creative and in great form, wish I can say the same about some of his conteporaries, namely Jimmy Page who has been threatening to release ""new"" music for the last several years. We've yet to hear/see that ""new"" music. The re-recorded, perviously aborted sessions for the Lucipher Rising soundtrack does not count as new or relevant btw. I digress. Back to Robert.

I've seen him live many times and this DVD is just the tip of the iceberg that his live performances can be.

Don't expect 1973 Zeppelin-like energy cause this is a different band, same singer , and a new medium.

Long story short - get out there and see him live, then buy this DVD

Peace!",1342137600,3,710,4.5234375
5133220,4,B0085HWZ9Y,"This is a Great Performance from Robert plant. However, I don't think this is the complete performance. Also, this concert is interrupted by interview segments between many songs. These two issues is the only reason it got 4 instead of 5 stars.",1342137600,6,244,4.833333333333333
5133221,5,B0085HWZ9Y,"saw them in San Diego. It's a memory revisited. Great crisp sound, visuals. Live long and continue to play, Robert",1341878400,,114,4.75
5133222,5,B0085HWZ9Y,"If you are in any way like-minded to my thinking you'd say Robert Plant began an excellent ""Americana Roots"" influenced musical journey with Raising Sand which quite unexpectedly ramped up to a more emotively charged height with Band of Joy.  In fact, I was so personally drawn to this group's music that I eagerly looked forward to their next album and tour.  Well, that is not to be, apparently...But, by leaving us with an excellent concert on DVD and Blu-Ray, Plant has left us with a searing document of just how fantastic this band was.  I stress this is not just Plant with a backing band, it is a real band in the truest sense as this concert unequivocally proves.

I was a bit slow to get on board as I found myself, after the initial honeymoon phase, not reaching for the Raising Sand CD very often.  Then I watched the BBC's Live at Electric Proms with Robert Plant and Band of Joy.  Wow!  Immediately this concert became a long-term favorite right up with the likes of such stellar concert DVDs at ""Concert for George"", ""The Last Waltz"", and my boot of Brian Wilson (& his band The Wondermints) at Glastonbury Festival.  I had to get the CD, which while not as quite as powerful as seeing the band live is wonderful and remains one I am drawn to.  This is a case where a live concert is even better than the CD which the tour supports.

The BBC show isn't, AFAIK, available as a DVD.  You can find it to burn to DVD if you know the usual places to look for this kind of stuff.  That really doesn't matter very much, however, because if I had to pick one: this one is the winner by a bit more than a nose, IMHO.  While they are both similar they have some important differences.  The BBC show has a finale with a full choir, but pushing this concert over the top is the middle stretch where Miller, Scott, and Griffin unique talents are showcased to a point that is brilliant.  That plus Plant and company's Zep reworkings, added in this part, drive it over the top.  It is uniformly excellent in all categories.  Keep in mind that I am saying this before the DVD or BD is out because my recording of it from the PBS broadcast is superlative and the even better sound, and likely even crisper (if that is possible) video of an official release will assuredly raise the bar - I look forward to delivery of the Blu-Ray from Amazon!

For me the knock-out unexpected centerpiece is fairly left-field. I am referring to Darrell's rendition, of all things, an old Porter Wagoner song: ""A Satisfied Mind"".  This warrants another ""Wow""!  Plant is selfless in allowing this group to contribute individually as well as collectively.  As mentioned Miller, Scott, and Griffin literally ""tear-it-up"" as they each take centerstage.  Not to forget the killer rhythym section of Byron House on bass and Marco Giovino on percussion.  Just listen to the fuzzed out electric bass (like on Move Up) as well as the articulate acoustic bass playing of House, it really is amazing.  Giovino's understanding of how to create texture is unsurpased as he's both fleet feeted with a lot of finesse as well as very heavy (Satan, Your Kingdom Must Come Down)...Brilliant percussive work!

Well, to me any way, this is Robert Plant's real ""second coming"" and this DVD is all one should need to observe that.  This is one concert I truly have no complaints other than I wish it was even longer!",1341792000,14,3374,4.535537190082644
5133223,5,B0085HWZ9Y,"If you did not have the pleasure of seeing Robert Plant & The Band Of Joy in concert, this release is something that you'll want to see. Filmed live on February 9, 2011 at Nashville, Tennessee's War Memorial Auditorium, this concert captures a hot performance on what was a snowy, cold night.

Lead singer Robert Plant brings his 40+ years of singing experience and his new-found love for American music, plus his old repertoire, singer/guitarist Patty Griffin brings her gospel/soul/country-style vocals plus some excellent acoustic guitar rhythm, Buddy Miller brings his arsenal of string instruments, including, acoustic guitars, Wandre electric and a Teo 12-string. He's an excellent picker that lends itself to the Americana roots style of playing, but I feel that he's got a mean streak of rock inside him, which shines while he's playing. Multi-instrumentalist Darrell Scott is a real delight. He plays acoustic, electric, mandola, pedal steel and banjo, plus he's got a hell of a great voice. So full of soul. It's not what you would expect upon first seeing him. Bassist Byron House was brought in by Buddy Miller and does not disappoint. He plays both upright bass and electric four-string both with ease and adds some very tasty bass lines. Percussionist Marco Giovino fills in the blanks and adds so much, but doesn't make an attempt to take center stage.

The set list for Live From the Artists Den: Robert Plant & the Band of Joy is pretty standard for the tour, offering up some new songs, some old songs and everything in between.

Set list:

1. Black Dog
2. Angel Dance
3. Houses of the Holy
4. House of Cards
5. Cindy, I'll Marry You Someday
6. Satan Your Kingdom Must Come Down
7. Somewhere Trouble Don't Go
8. Tangerine
9. A Satisfied Mind
10. Move Up
11. Down to the Sea
12. Ramble On
13. Gallows Pole
14. In the Mood
15. Rock and Roll
16. I Bid You Goodnight

Long gone is the golden god, flowing lion's mane, cock rock. What you will see in this release is not Led Zeppelin or anything close. It is bits and pieces of Americana, roots, country, soul and gospel goodness. Robert said in an included interview that he now prefers the intimacy of playing at smaller auditoriums and ballrooms. The music that they play requires it. This release captures the live experience so well, with full-stage shots as well as close-up views, it's as if you could have been in the audience that night.

Robert Plant has moved on to the Sensational Space Shifters, returning to a more international edge that Plant is known for, but for the brief amount of existance that the Band Of Joy performed, this release captures that time perfectly.

Live From the Artists Den: Robert Plant & the Band of Joy will be released on Blu-ray and DVD on July 10 and worldwide on July 9 through Universal Music Group International at all the online retailers, as well as your usual retail stores. I highly recommend that you reserve yourself a copy now.

5133230,5,B0085HWZ9Y,"Absolutely one of my favorite concerts.  The sound is well recorded as are the visual in the beautiful War Memorial Theater in Nashville, Tennessee.  The journey of Robert Plant took a turn when he joined with Alison Krauss for the Raisin' Sand album.  It was a fit, but a just a little something felt more produced than organic in spite of it's excellence.  Most felt Plant and Krauss would go for volume II.  What happened was, ultimately, more of a growth than a letdown when instead of Krauss, Plant reconvened a totally new Band of Joy.  This time there was a more organic and natural musical flow which was that small missing link in the previous album.  The Band of Joy album was more emotive and direct in it's power, but the tour that followed proved the pinnacle of Plant's Americana musical journey was performing live with The Band of Joy.  See what I'm talking about in this well put-together concert video.  It holds up for me along side of greats such as Who's Concert For New York excerpt, The Band's Last Waltz, and The Concert For George.",1451779200,2,1056,4.574468085106383

5133234,3,B0085HWZ9Y,"Another reviewer summed it up best: this performance just lacks energy. In addition, I just don't think the Plant the ""Rock God"" was ever meant to stray this far from his roots. I realize this is supposed to be an homage to Nashville music, but come on; there's just way too much quasi-church and insipid country influence here, and let's face it, even at age 62, Plant isn't ever going to shed his raunchy rock and roller image. Strangely enough, while watching this, I had the thought: ""What's next? An act in Vegas for old farts?"" when I remembered that friend told me that Plant HAD been doing Vegas recently.

I can't fault the image quality of this Blu-ray (although the camera work is about as tame and unimaginative as a musical set from Hee-Haw), and the sound quality is top notch. The Band of Joy III is good enough; probably on their own they're all superb musicians. It's just that this group doesn't really come together, and when they do, there's not much of an explosion. This is especially true of Patty Griffin. She may be great in her own right, but her voice is just not a good match for harmonizing with Plant's. He's still got a very smooth soulful vocal, but it seems like every time he starts to croon, she comes on like nails on a chalkboard with her rough, Coal Miner's Daughter rasp. It's just not a good fit at all, and I have to admit, I immediately suspected that there must have been something going on between her and Plant, or she never would have made it past the first round of auditions. Sure enough, a quick trip to Wikipedia confirmed it.

Just prior to picking up this concert, I had recently been listening to several of the many live bootlegs that exist of Robert Plant from the late 80's and early 90's when he was touring with his first solo band. He really was in top form before an audience, and although his crowd interaction has always been a bit tame and laid back, at least his singing was dynamite. Now, 30 years later, it seems, from this performance at least, he's about ready to hang it up and find some new, low energy gig in which to while away his declining years. I hope it's not true; I for one am not going to encourage him by giving this tepid effort more than (really) 2 and a half stars.",1439337600,,2249,4.390887290167866

5133262,2,B0085HWZ9Y,"I had high expectations when I bought this Blu-ray.  The Led Zeppelin songs were re-arranged to the point that they were virtually unrecognizable.  ""Ramble On"" was the only song capturing the spirit of the original.  Plant's voice sounds weak and worn and his new persona is sort of an old cowboy. He hasn't aged well.  He has some talented musicians in the band, but the alt-country style really doesn't fit his voice or style.  Led Zeppelin was the zenith of his career - it's all been downhill from there.  His early solo work was far better than this.  He seems resentful that his solo work isn't getting the recognition or acclaim that his work with Zeppelin did.  His acidic comments about Page and John Paul Jones don't reflect well on him.  They have handled the situation with a lot of grace.  I didn't like his collaboration with Allison Krause (sp.?) and she's been a bad influence, musically.  Can anyone REALLY prefer Krause to early Joni Mitchell!?!?!  Plant needs to retire.  He's destroying my memories of him live, in his prime.  Take a hint from Grace Slick and Joni Mitchell and leave before the party is completely over .....",1404518400,,1145,4.717171717171717

5133267,5,B0085HWZ9Y,"Like Robert Plant much but never an uber fan.  However, this well recoded performance is one of the best recorded concerts I've seen/heard.  The material is varied and mostly unfamiliar to me.  There are influences of gospel, country, various flavors of rock and some of Plant's uniquely mystic/spooky touches.

The band is marvelous.  Buddy Miller's brilliantly funky guitar tones wrung from a number of very cool instruments both color and propel.  Patty Griffin has a wonderful clear yet edgy voice which she uses superbly whether singing lead or harmonizing beautifully with Plant.  I confess that her restrained gyrations in a snug leather skirt add to the viewing pleasure too.  And Byron House on bass- he has become a favorite for his drive, versatility, virtuosity and impeccable taste.  You get everything from perfect, straight forward upright backing work to total shredding on a Fender P-bass.  Daryl Scott supports on guitar, lap steel, banjo & kitchen sink.

I bought the DVD after my wife and I had seen the show on PBS several times- Whenever it came on we both just stopped in our tracks and had to watch it to the end, completely transfixed.  We've probably played the DVD 5 or 6 times in the past year.",1390694400,4,1222,4.878640776699029

The camera-work and angles are perfectly synched to the songs throughout and nothing from start to finish is tiring or boring about this DVD.

Buddy Miller was great doing Somewhere Trouble Don't Go as was Darrell Scott doing A Satisfied Mind. For her number I would have preferred to have Patty do one of the songs she has written, and she has written many wonderful songs. I always loved Led Zep when they were at their most folk rocky and Gallows Pole was one of my faves of theirs. The intensity with which Patty Griffin sings at the end of Gallows Pole is stunning. Being a Fairport Convention fan, the insertion of the beginning of Come All Ye by Patty and Plant, in the middle of I'm in the Mood was a touch of genius.

5133275,5,B0085HWZ9Y,"Robert Plant could continue to play Led Zeppelin tunes 'just like the record' for decades and fill venues with ecstatic fans. Or he could simply reunite with his old cohorts and make millions, some suggest billions, doing Led Zeppelin stadium gigs all over the plant.  Instead, he's chosen to honor his own authenticity and musical curiosity, following his muse where it takes him and giving those smart enough to follow along a musical education in the process.  I consider myself one of the enlightened: Because of him, I broke down and paid attention to bluegrass and American roots music and while I will never be a fan of modern Country music, there are now a number of well-loved bluegrass albums in my collection and I have him to thank for their discovery.  This DVD (and the CD and band that gave birth to it) and his work with Allison Krauss are two primary reasons why.

This performance is a tour-d-force of musicianship.  Every member of the band brings something exquisite to the table, and the sum is a celebration of it's parts.  This is a group of players at their best who understand the language of music and use it masterfully to communicate with their audience.  Nearly anyone who loves music will find something here to enjoy, and that diversity is probably the very best part.

Plunk your coins down and take this one home.  You won't be disappointed.",1372636800,6,1374,4.7154811715481175

5133281,5,B0085HWZ9Y,"Having just recently bought and watched Led Zeppelin `Celebration Day' and been completely blown away I was wondering how I would find Robert Plant in a different musical setting which I assumed would have none of the intensity and excitement of Led Zeppelin. How wrong I was. The show starts with a completely reworked laid back version of `Black Dog' and then into the stomping `Angel Dance' which is where this gig just takes off and doesn't let up. Four glorious voices combine on `House Of Cards' and each musician is given ample opportunity to show off their vocal and instrumental talents over the next sixteen songs. At times I could hear shades of `The Band' with a nice loose feel to many of the songs.

Robert Plant's voice is excellent and the fun they are having onstage is contagious .This Blu Ray version has superb DTS HD 5.1sound and great visual definition and if you like the`Raising Sand' and `Band of Joy' albums then this is for you.

From the reimagined Zep classics to the flawless harmonies with the seductively undulating Patti Griffith, to the ""how does he make that sound"" guitar pyrotechnics of Buddy Miller, it was ALL GOOD and way beyond my expectations.  Robert Plant has continued to re-invent himself since the halcyon days of Led Zep, and I just love it.  BUY IT NOW.",1354752000,,464,4.634146341463414
5133289,5,B0085HWZ9Y,"No, despite what I'm about to say, I don't think Robert Plant is perfect.  I just think he's about as close as one can ever be.
The fact that he has been singing, writing, playing for somewhere in the neighbourhood of half a century and can and does still seek out new ways to express and share his gifts is uniquely remarkable in itself.
In working with Alison Krauss - a combination few if any but T. Bone Burnett could have conceived - he won 5 Grammy Awards at the age of 60.  Every catagory in which they were nominated including Album of the Year.
Band of Joy is another pivot giving a different perspective.  Whether he can hit high notes or not is, to me irrelevant.  As with Krauss, he can take Zeppelin tunes and give them new life and a beauty that was, perhaps before unseen.  His voice is every bit as remarkable, beautiful and emotively expressive as ever it was.  A whisper of a lyric with a bit of blues and soul embellishment is every bit the equal of the gut-wrenching screams from his Zeppelin days.
He is also a fantastic interview.  Humour, self-deprecation, insight, intelligent, always seeking, honesty without tedious detail.  The rather impish twinkle that has always been in his eyes reflects, I think, a love of life and exploration.  Learning, openness, fearlessness and the burning urge to squeeze every drop out of life.  What more could one ask.  Working with other great artists ?  He's got that too.",1353974400,3,1432,4.594488188976378
5133290,5,B0085HWZ9Y,"Man, I thought the Strange Sensation DVD was untouchable, but Plant's innovation and creativity pushed the boundaries of BoJ on this DVD. Wow.  Buddy Miller is off-the-hook, the rythym section rumbles and rolls, and my favorite surprise was watching how unbelievable Darrel Scott is. Wish he was in my band. If you like Robert, buy it. If you're a musician, regardless of genre, buy it and learn.",1352073600,2,396,4.91044776119403

I wish Robert Plant had kept the Band of Joy together because they were onto something really good.

My wife and I live in Arkansas about 3 hours from Clarskdale. To my eternal regret we were already committed to a birthday party for one of our dear friends (now that's a Whole Lotta Love!!). So, not being able to see the real deal in person, we picked up this DVD of his Band of Joy show. I can play the first song, ""Black Dog"" a hundred times and not get tired of it!! From beginning to end this is a seamless, celestial tapestry with freight train impact!! My only complaint is not having a cd of the show to play.

I  think Robert Plants voice sounds better as he sings softer now than it did in his hey day as the golden voice of Led Zeppelin. The other musicians that make up the Band of Joy are tops in their field. This is a show that I would pay good money to see them play. I am very happy that I bought this DVD so that I can enjoy this show many more times over the years to come.

5133296,5,B0085HWZ9Y,"After former Led Zeppelin front man Plant ended a brief but successful pairing with bluegrass star Alison Krauss he formed this Band of Joy named after an early pre-Zep collaboration from the 1960's.  This time he includes several heavyweights into the mix including singer/guitarist/songwriter Patty Griffin, guitarist/singer and producer extraordinaire Buddy Miller, singer and player of anything with strings Darrell Scott, bassist Byron House and drummer/percussionist Marco Giovino.

This band is like a perfect cocktail.  One part country, one part blues, one part gospel, one part soul and fill the glass with rock `n roll.  Plant still has what it takes but he no longer screeches and screams.  His musical taste is perfecto with 6 or 7 Led Zep songs (out of 16) that sound brand new given the great arrangements.  Each band member is given a chance to shine and they all do.  Pay special attention to Miller when he gets a guitar solo (often).  He's as good as anybody in the business.

This concert was filmed in Nashville at the War Memorial Auditorium by the TV program ""Live from the Artist Den."" The disc includes a brief tribute to the venue and very brief interviews between some of the songs.  The concert itself is a too brief 77 minutes and features a PCM Stereo or DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 option.  I saw this group when they first got together a couple years ago.

5133298,5,B0085HWZ9Y,"I've seen Robert Plant in concert three times. The best thing I can call this concert DVD is uplifting. It's a different take and different style of tunes that are new and tunes that are tried and true. I saw the Band of Joy about three or so months after this show was recorded in Nashville. Needless to say, they didn't disappoint. Great interview with Robert as well. The closing number is very poignant. The DVD itself got here in quick time.

5133300,5,B0085HWZ9Y,"Forever facing an audience quite literally frothing at the gash to hear Led Zeppelin classics every time he plays live (and who can blame them) - to some extent Robert Plant has spent years distancing himself from that to establish a solo identity. And a truly genius move on his part was his ""Raising Sand"" album from 2007 with Alison Krauss - a captivating mixture of ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" old-timey Gospel and Country music given modern-day arrangements and a deliciously softened intimacy. Then came Part 2 of sorts in the ""Band Of Joy"" project/album from 2010.

Filmed in 2011 in the gorgeous setting of the War Memorial Auditorium in Nashville in Tennessee - I mention these two CDs because in some ways ""Live At The Artist's Den"" feels like a live gig of both albums - with a few curveballs thrown in. And instead of Alison Krauss - we get Patty Griffin doing the female vocal honours - and she (like the rest of the band) absolutely rock.

As for the main man - Robert Plant not only looks and sounds great on this fab BLU RAY (he can do a soft vocal caress or a rock-God scream on a dime) - it's thrilling to see that he is wholly relevant to 2012 and not just 1969. His present set list and song choices now encompass Blues, Gospel, Traditionals, Folk, Rock and World - and it all meshes into the most wonderfully uplifting sound. You can't quite nail down a genre for this but you know it's good. Throw in a truly stunning set of musicians backing him up (Buddy Miller and Darrell Scott on guitars in particular) - and Plant finally seems comfortable - glad to be on stage with these great people - even grinning with relish as he revisits rarely-heard Led Zep album tracks. Wisely too he gives solo slots to Miller, Scott and Griffin - all of whom carry the limelight with shockingly good voices and an ability to play most famous musicians under the table. The four even do an Acapella piece at the end that is more than impressive.

But inevitably it's when the evening touches on stuff from Zep II like ""Ramble On"" and Zep III like ""Tangerine"" and ""Gallows Pole"" - then things just lift off into another stratosphere. Plant has re-arranged the songs so that they now sound like the unplugged feel of the ""No Quarter"" sessions but with a more rocking band and a grittier edge. The results are fantastic. There are also brilliantly reconstructed versions of ""Black Dog"" and ""Rock And Roll"" from ""Zep IV"" and a funkily cool reworking of ""Houses Of The Holy"".

Released July 2012 - the picture quality (on BLU RAY) is superb - the gig intimate - and the crowd responsive. And even if you don't know the newer material - the songs are very strong melodically and played with superb feeling by musicians who have a lifetime of musical knowledge flowing through their veins. The only downsides would be that the extras are short - and the gig could have been longer. I actually wanted more - and not less.

To sum up - you can't help but feel that Percy has always been smart - constantly trying to evolve himself and his knowledge of what he loves. And this superbly musical gig sees him finally arrive at a place where he's here in his future and at peace with his past. And we mere mortals can get to enjoy both.

Recommended like a ""Hey Hey Mama...""",1344211200,10,3268,4.474832214765101
5133301,5,B0085HWZ9Y,"Before I begin my review, I want state up front that I did not come to this highly entertaining DVD from the point of a Led Zeppelin or Robert Plant fan, as many of the previous reviewers her have. In fact I don't even own one Led Zep album.

I first saw (and heard) Plant performing with Alison Krauss at the Americana Music Awards in Nashville, on the eve of their embarking on the ""Raising Sand"" CD and tour. It was Krauss, and the incomparable guitarist/singer/producer Buddy Miller - the music director for that evening- that brought me to see Plant. I wasn't sure what to expect (and neither was the audience at the Awards Show) but we were all drawn in.

After the Raising Sand project, Plant decided he like the ""Americana"" mode and used Miller to put together the Band of Joy. Nashville music stalwarts Byron House (bass) and Darrell Scott (multi-instrumentalist, but also a songwriter with a string of CDs to his credit) were brought in. Singer-songwriter Patty Griffin joined the group and subsequently married Plant in the last month. And there there was Miller holding it all together like glue.

This ""concert"" was staged in Nashville specifically for the Live at The Artists Den television series and - as others have pointed out - it differs some from the national tour by the group. It runs 77 minutes (to fit TV schedules) so those who saw the tour will find songs missing.

As for performance, I thought the band was in fine form and everyone got their own spotlight (not just the rock icon whose name is three times the size of the band's on the DVD cover. They work as a team with each member supporting the other.

There are a few interview segments included and then a longer (nearly 30-minute) interview with Plant as a bonus.

I'll leave it to my fellow reviewers to provide more details but just say that this is an interesting crossover concept where a British rocker gets to ""Americana"" and Nashville's best musicians get to rock out too!

I've never seen any of the other ""Live From The Artists Den"" shows but, after seeing this DVD I'm looking forward to watching more.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

The concert offers a wide variety of songs that are done in a way that you wouldn't expect, and the individual acts by Buddy Miller, Darrell Scott and Patty Griffin all add to the diversity of this show. I especially like their rendition of Robert Plant's solo work from 1993 ""Down To The Sea"" and ""In The Mood"" from 1983. I can easily say this will be one of my ""Go-to"" tapes when I want to watch a quality performance.

And then add to the mix the stellar Darrell Scott playing his butt off of every instrument with the backing of Byron House on bass and Marco Giovino on drums and you a mix of well... PURE JOY!  When I put it on, I thought I'd listen to a few cuts in the background as I did some work...  Well that didn't happen.  I was MESMERIZED!  This is a such a good disc, yes there are a few interview bits thrown in as one reviewer says, however they honestly don't bother me.  Robert appears to be genuinely joyful about being on the stage with the players he's chosen.  His respect for their talent is obvious in that he showcases them in a number of places even giving them the stage for their own songs.  Highly recommended for lovers of music.  It does not matter if you like Zeppelin or not, these are NOT your parents Zeppelin songs... these swing AND rock.  So glad I bought this and will enjoy it over and over.

8525605,5,B0085HWZ9Y,"I just love this show!  I saw the abbreviated version of this show on one of the cable TV music channels and just fell in love with it.  After I watched the Blu-ray version, I have no idea how they whittled the show down to the abbreviated cable version because the whole show is so good!

This show is a great example of Americana, the perfect blend of rock, folk, bluegrass, and a pinch of country.  Robert Plant is  a very seasoned singer who has really refined his craft.  And the caliber of musicians who make up the Band of Joy are second to none.  The six band members mesh together beautifully, yet each musician is very prominent in their individual contribution.

Rarely does a band come along with four top notch singers, each of whom does the lead vocals at some point during the show. And if never seen Plant do backing vocals on several songs during a show where he is the band's front man.  Prior to discovering this show, I had never heard of the other musicians besides Plant (that I recall), but after researching them a bit, I quickly realized that I've heard each of the musicians music before -- either as session musicians or as members of big name headliner bands or covers of songs that they wrote.

Have to say tho, it does make one wonder...with all the money, just in royalties alone from the Led Zeppelin recordings...why is Robert Plant still having to appear in public making music? Being somewhat snide , I had reservations watching the performance of his then new Band Of Joy thinking skeptically "" Has he really blown all that previous wealth to come down to play publicly in humiliation for the common rabble from his mansion in some exclusive redoubt?"" I mean...Really, now! Surprisingly, even though he did do some obligatory old Zep standards he managed to do them with some dignity and lan...surprisingly. I actually found myself liking his NOT making a fool of himself with a lesser ( but new) band of peers and gravitated to his musically astute choice of a female ( vamp) guitarist for this particular recording .In fact I liked it so much, despite all those unfounded reservations that I decided I would like to see the performance again, and perhaps share it with someone else as well. I actually enjoyed the entire performance better tan any live performances I've seen with pretentions Led Zeppelin were so brazen about displaying on stage in all lack of humility.
