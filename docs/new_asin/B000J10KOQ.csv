8148410,5,B000J10KOQ,This DVD has Ray Montgomery in it! Do you remember him? Those of us who loved Ramar of the Jungle and other films with him such as Air Force? He was just a kid then. But cute as a kitten. His performance is spot on. Try it you'll like it. It shows his versatility. Jane,1388966400,,269,3.909090909090909
