8346422,5,B00001AQZ5,"God is able to do exceedingly and abundantly above what we can ask or think.  Mrs. Pierce demonstrates this as she carefully takes us through the ""routine"" so many of us have gotten into when it comes to going to church.  Sit on the right pew, sing the right hymn, wear the right clothes...or you don't really know God or have a relationship with him.  She leads us to the better part-choosing to serve the Lord with our whole heart and not getting caught up in meaningless rituals that we see as church.  Yes, we should come together and worship the Lord but when all is said and done what matters the most is knowing that our lives are secure in Christ.  It's amazing how this video shows us that weeping may endure for a night, but joy does come in the morning.  Her testimony demonstrates this fact vividly.  The songs minister God's grace and mercy so sweetly.  You will laugh and cry and learn which is the better part of our lives in Christ.",977184000,9,948,4.377142857142857
8346423,5,B00001AQZ5,"This video will make you laugh and cry. Chonda Pierce brings out the lighter side of christianity, and shows us that God also has a sense of  humor. In this video, Chonda really touches on all those things that get on  our ""last nerve"" thus on her soapbox! She shows us what it means  to be a happy christian and remnds us that God does love us  unconditionally, and shares her personal testimony. I have watched this  video numerous times, and it gets better every time I see it!",941241600,30,480,4.348314606741573
