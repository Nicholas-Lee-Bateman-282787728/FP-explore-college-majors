7868743,5,630435441X,This DVD is hilarious and just about every comedian that takes the stage will have you laughing.  It's just worth having because of Dave Chapelle. There are comedians I have never heard of but they still keep you laughing. I definitely recommend this DVD.  It is one of the better Comedy Def Jam DVDs.,1122076800,2,301,4.555555555555555
