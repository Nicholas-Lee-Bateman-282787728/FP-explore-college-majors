3987885,1,B002U6DVO4,"Che Guevara has had one of the most fascinating lives in the history of Latin American culture and politics, yet somehow Steven Soderbergh has made a bloated, turgid, and worst of all, BORING film of his life.  How is this possible?  Regardless of whether you are a leftist, Communist, conservative, apolitical, fascist, Democrat, or Republican, one cannot argue that Che's life is incredible stuff.  It's filled with intrigue, twists, turns, adventures, and most importantly, it's infused with myth and an epic quality.  One can argue about Che's political beliefs, and whether he was a genuine hero for the poor or an opportuinistic politician who was only out for himself, but one can't argue that this film has taken this amazing life and made it into one of the most annoying, sleep inducing, and blandest bioepics I have ever seen.

Soderbergh's camera keeps an ""objective"" distance throughout, like he's a scientist observing a tribe or an another anthropological study.  It's not a good effect, and it makes the film an absolute chore to sit through.  Even Benicio del Toro, a brooding, fine actor, is boring here, reading his line with somnabulistic efficiency.  It's really hard to believe that someone could screw up the life of Che Guevara, but Soderbergh does it.  Soderbergh made it well known that he was having trouble distribtuing his 4 1/2 hour epic, playing the ""martyred artist"" card.  There's only one problem with that.  Soderbergh isn't an artist, and his film fails in every aspect.  The whole film is one of the most bloated, tedious films I've ever seen.  Don't even bother with it.  You'll never get that 4 1/2 hours back.",1258848000,17,1649,4.949090909090909

3987889,5,B002U6DVO4,"I have not yet seen this film. I plan to buy the DVD when it comes out--at which point I may end up changing my rating. But for now, I simply wanted to function as a counter to the 1-star reviews which offered no analysis of the film whatsoever. Their tirade seemed to be, in effect: ""This film is about Che. I don't like Che. Therefore, this film is bad.""

I tend to like Soderbergh's work, but I will withhold judgment until I've actually viewed the film, and can put together a sentence or two that a) avoids the usage of meaningless epithets such as ""America haters,"" and b) demonstrates a thoughtful engagement with the film--even if I have any issues with it.",1257292800,8,665,4.40650406504065
3987890,1,B002U6DVO4,What kind of sick mind could produce such a piece of hagiography?  Why does this sociopath continue to exert such a hold on the maiden-aunt sensibilities of North American liberals?

3987891,3,B002U6DVO4,"Steven Soderbergh created one of those movies that is lucky to have been made at all -- a four-hour-plus biopic of Cuban revolutionary Che Guevara.

But like most biographical movies, it's something of a mixed bag. Visually atmosphere and low-key in style, the two halves of ""Che"" focus on pivotal slices  of Guevara's life, with an amazing lead performance by Benicio Del Toro as the titular revolutionary. Unfortunately, it's also a very slow-moving affair that brushes past some of the more unsavory facets of Che Guevara's life and personality... and ironically many of the positive ones.

Part 1: In the 1960s, Guevara (Benicio Del Toro) is in New York City for a UN conference, being interviewed by a US reporter about his viewpoints as a guerilla leader and revolutionary. Then the narrative jumps back a decade to when he and others (including Fidel Castro) consider the many injustices over in Cuba and start planning for a revolution. Despite being Argentinian by birth, Che follows them to Cuba and joins the guerilla revolution.

But despite his start as a medic, Che began showing talents in other areas, and becomes a leader of the guerilla outlaws in the Cuban countryside. He grapples with his own ill health (asthma), the loss of his compatriots and the attacks from the military, which also threaten some of the non-revolutionaries -- and as time goes on, their revolution gained power and notice, and began the ultimate battle for control of Cuba.

Part 2: Later in life, Guevera comes to Bolivia disguised as a bespectacled bald businessman, with the intent of fighting another revolution in that country. But this revolution doesn't go as well as the Cuban one (for Che): shortages in food, internal betrayal, and one of their contacts (Franka Potente) goofs up royally. As Guevera's health deteriorates, the Bolivian army  and the CIA take measures to quash his guerilla forces...

Rather than the usual biographical movie format, Steven Soderbergh approaches ""Che"" as if he were filming a documentary. There are no scenes of little Che being kicked by a rich guy or melodramatic subplots -- it's quite literally a slice of the pivotal point of Che Guevara's life, and a 1960s shakycam interview adds to that feeling. As an added note of authenticity, almost all of the dialogue is in Spanish rather than poorly-accented English, giving a you-are-there feel.

The storyline is rather slow, speeding up gradually as the revolution really heats up... only to slow back down in the second half with Guevera's decline.  Most of the story is devoted to the guerillas staggering through the countryside, living in rough shacks and campsites. Even the landscapes reflect the ascent and descent of Guevera's power -- the first half is crammed with lush, vibrant jungle life, and the second is a washed-out, grey expanse of scrubby brush. Unfortunately, this means that over four hours, the story often drags like a ripped parachute.

But despite the slowness, each movie climaxes with some revolutionary action. Pinging gunshots, explosions, tanks, tense chases through deserted streets and burning trains all play a part in the harrowing finales of each half, which are all the worst because you know that all this mayhem actually took place.

Del Toro is, to put it mildly, astonishing as Guevara -- not only is he a dead ringer physically (with the right facial hair and clothes), but he exudes a quiet charisma, literate intelligence and power that make you see exactly why someone might follow him if they agreed with his politics. No one else in the story really gets to stand out, but Del Toro simply IS the cast all by himself.

Yet ironically it's a piously bland, virtuous portrait of Guevera. Soderbergh wimps out on the cruel, extremist sides of his personality and the regime he helped create; on the other hand, he also brushes over the man's fierce intellect, his writing, and world interests. It feels like we're looking at one mirrored facet of a very complex man, and surely more of who he was -- the good, the bad AND the ugly -- could have been included.

It's obvious Soderbergh put a lot of heart into producing the raw, realistic ""Che,"" but his glorification and simplication of a controversial figure drags down his labor of love.",1256688000,48,4268,4.944134078212291
3987922,5,B002U6DVO4,"Che's life during and after Cuban Revolution in two parts. Authentic as it can get. Well acted by an excellent cast headed by Benicio DelToro. Print quality is excellent. It is really a documentary. As cinema goes, masterfully made.",1410393600,,232,4.9743589743589745
3987923,5,B002U6DVO4,I enjoyed the way Che committed himself to seeking a way out of poverty for others.,1408752000,,83,4.25
3987924,5,B002U6DVO4,"Seriously, if you don't have a clue about the man or the Cuban Revolution, this is not the intro film for you, and you'll end up hating it. If you've read Jon Lee Anderson's book, or have some knowledge of Che and what occurred during the Cuban Revolution, then you'll love this as much as I did.

What I loved:
The film neither glorifies nor demonizes the man. It accurately chronicles his role in the revolution, his strengths (his genuine concern for the peasants, his obsession with social justice, etc.) and his flaws (his dogmatism, his disastrous agenda in trying to export the revolution to other countries.) The acting is absolutely superb, particularly del Toro, Bichir (Fidel) and Cabrera (Camilo). With the last one I truly was curious how the actor would be able to pull off Camilo's personality, but Cabrero captured his essence beautifully. The commentary by Anderson, and interviews with those who fought along with Che were incredibly interesting.

My ""cons"" are minor:
I wish they showed the rebels' triumphant entrance into Havana, and the euphoric reaction of the people. They were treated like true liberators/rock stars, and those first few months following the revolution were truly an idealistic and hopeful time (before Castro's true agenda emerged.) Also, I agree with another reviewer regarding Camilo's ""sidekick"" portrayal. As I said above, the actor depicted Camilo's likeability, charm and humor wonderfully. But it downplayed Cienfuegos' true role in the revolution, which was that of a courageous warrior. He was the soul of the revolution, idolized by the masses, and whose popularity rivaled that of Fidel's post-revolution (which is why he ended up dead in an airplane ""accident"" a few months later.)

Overall, a brilliant film of one of history's most controversial and fascinating figures.",1397088000,,1827,5.186440677966102
3987925,5,B002U6DVO4,So glad I was able to find this movie -- it tells the story of Che Guevara perfectly.  Great acting -- very realistic filming!,1392076800,,126,4.25

3987927,5,B002U6DVO4,"Technically significant; being the first major movie made with the RED video camera which requires much less light. The quality of this DVD set is excellent with informative supplements,  especially when showing how the director himself filmed with the RED and edited on just his laptop.
Best actor award at Cannes is the ""cherry on top"" for this excellent and, for me, ""fair"" bio-pick, which picks up after the film ""Motorcycle Diaries"".""",1384560000,3,439,5.097222222222222
3987928,4,B002U6DVO4,"And the but is that Che was very much an ends justified the means type of communist revolutionary. He was after all a Stalinist. Who believed that society's needed to be quickly and dramatically restructured by neutralizing whole classes of people be they academics, students, workers, capitalists, petite bourgeoisie. Or who ever else got in his way. Ultimately Che broke every rule he ever wrote in his little handbook on guerrilla warfare and was hunted down in the Bolivian jungle by US Army Special Forces, the CIA, Bolivian Rangers and allowed himself to be captured, humiliated and executed. Many who who are knowledgeable on the subject including, Che in his lst words to a Cuban ex-patriot CIA officer who captured him believe that Fidel Castro could have had the Bolivian communist party smuggle Che out of the country but instead sent him on a one way trip.",1382918400,,868,4.91156462585034
3987929,5,B002U6DVO4,"one of the best films I seen about Ernesto, it shows all the diffrents  sides of him as a soldier of a revolution and his full emotions against the u.s.and capitalism. and the tragic end of a great legend that will never died and I can go on and on, great movie about that chapter of his life.",1376784000,2,293,4.051724137931035

Both informative and hightly entertaining with excellent use of subtitle, although the acting, which is supurb, really says it all. The special effects are realistic amid beautiful backdrops. The supporting cast only adds to the realism of the movie. I would strong recommend this movie ot anyone interested the Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara, the man before be became the legend and whose iconic picture came to adorn just about every campus dorm in the West during the late 60's and early 70's. Anyone interested in Castro, Cuba, or the events of the late 1950's and the 1960's which changed the world as it changed a generation would enjoy the film as well.",1372896000,3,744,4.775193798449612
3987931,3,B002U6DVO4,"The Bluray from Criterion is about 22Mbps and has tons of extras that are quite informative. The Bluray from Universal is 30Mbps plus with few extras. Criterion is the better package with slightly weaker detail. Sometimes the Universal looks oversharpened but anyway there is no argument that it shows more grain and detail to objects. To me the Criterion is a decent run of the mill 22Mbps, but with this overly grainy transfer it can run into problems at times being steady in the IQ department.

As for the film. It's a bit boring to be honest and of very questionable factual foundation. Che did some good things I suppose. He also did some very bad things. Politics and War go hand in hand. Communism so far is an ideal that has never taken shape without disturbances too much to bear. Democracy is fast turning into fascism today. Che is caught in the middle as a villain and hero. Who knows who is right. There are some great scenes in this film and the locations and film techniques are enough to give it a rental. But rent before you buy. This film is slow, tedious at times, and really not worth your money before you read about the figure presented here in more detail from a variety of accounts.",1370649600,,1207,4.511415525114155
3987942,5,B002U6DVO4,"I admit with some embarrassment that I know almost nothing about Che and his personal  history besides his popular image(s). Given decades of cold war polarizations I am not sure what popular images are worth. The film was excellent in that it motivated me to want to learn much more.

I thought the film was great and what really stood out for me was Che as a war film. We have seen endless films portraying the heroic side and the tragic side and the foolish side of ""military"" armed conflicts -- from swords and castles to modern tanks and battle ships.  One gets a feeling for what they may have been like. I have also seen a few films that portray certain types of guerilla wars from certain perspectives. They tend to be local uprisings and focus on action and have tight scripts. Then there are films such as those that deal with the Mexican Revolution for example, which was sort of a mix between guerilla uprisings and organized battles.

One thing I appreciated about Che was that it was slow and did not focus on battle as much as on the patience, strength, and conviction required to fight this sort of guerilla war. It was a side of war that is too easy to forget about or reduce to bland verbal knowledge without true sensitivity. In this sense the film was artistic in trying to give a realistic ""feeling"" for living for years under endlessly harsh and tediously lonely conditions and prolonged suffering for one's cause. Yet it was not in my opinion an overly dramatic sob story to lionize the revolutionaries. It sort of can in its own way, but not so as to make you groan. There was a lot of their having to deal with small things like minor disputes between fighters, or getting help from skeptical peasants, forgetting medications.  Morale is of course important in any kind of war and a lot of it has to do with the small interactions that make up real life.

I would not say it does in the end make them look like heroes as much as it helps you to see why many people consider them to be heroes. It is really ambiguous about whether Castro was doing the best possible for Cuba and hints that there may be two sides to that story, but it largely avoids the issue, which would have been very complicated to weigh in on considering if nothing else how extremely difficult the US blockade made things for his regime and the Cuban people. It has not been a ""clean"" experiment, as much of the world understands. With regard to Che in particular frankly I got the impression that his efforts in Bolivia
 were tragically misguided. That would make him a mixed hero at best. The landscape shown for Bolivia looked a lot like Southern California or Southern France. I think it was shot in Spain. But anyway what difficult terrain for armies on the move to try to hide in! Not like the deep forests and mountains of Cuba, or the forests of Vietnam. His crusade there did not seem to reflect good judgement -- but that is just my opinion and maybe things looked different to him and his supporters. Anyway on this count I don't think the film portrays him as more than a vulnerable human being, albeit with great determination, intelligence, and idealism.

If he was heroic it was more like martyrs that died for the strength of their convictions, rather than a great leader. IF he was a great leader so far as the film makes its  points, it was largely in that that he gave a lot of people hope -- and frankly died for them. This would be sort of like the reading of Jesus that he was the champion of the poor who was killed in the course of his campaign. In this view Che becomes for some people a Christ-like figure. If I look at it this way I can better understand the posters and T-shirts. The film helped ME to better understand this, but I don't think it pushed the idea at all. It only fleshed out the story and gave some information to work with.

Some people will appreciate being warned about the slow pace of the film. But I loved all the slow glimpses into ordinary life in the field. Also the scenes seemed somewhat disjointed to me. It was sort of -- for me -- like watching someone's home movies or pictures of their vacations. But I like that and this worked for me. Somehow it really does hang together.

I should say that I was so engrossed by the atmosphere that maybe the scenes actually did hang together more tightly than it seemed to me. And again I am not complaining, just letting potential viewers what to expect. I thought the editing and pace worked quite well. I later noticed that Terrence Malick played a role in getting the film started. [...] I thought maybe it still reflected some of his ""meditation"" on war style, which I happen to like.

So I largely appreciated this film as a very special war film but that is not the only reason for rating it tops. Whether or not you agree with armed revolution as an approach to problems, this film does create strong images and reminders of the social problems in Latin America. Because of social oppression revolutionary movements have been going on for centuries in Latin America and they are still with us. A lot of this has to do with strong class differences and gaps between rich and poor. These were at the root of Cuban revolutionary movements going back to the 1800s and and why Che saw common cause with Bolivia

I must say that I watched the E1Films issue of Che which so far as I can tell is the same as the Criterion issue. But I cannot find the issue that I picked up in a used bin on Amazon.

If like me, you don't know much about Che the extra features will be very helpful. It is really interesting that so many people who were involved in making this film and making it work so well did not know much about him when they were approached. Making the film, doing the research, catching up with the facts, taught them a lot about a history that had remarkably enough been quite neglected.

There will be critics because they wanted this to be a different film, perhaps more action, perhaps more personal life of Che, perhaps more ideological clarity, etc. etc. But I think the film stands very well on its own and is excellent in the context of the points I mentioned. Oh, and Del Toro did a very fine job of acting and scenery was beautiful.",1357689600,,6244,4.412684622067768

Its account of this man's story. Which is interesting and heroic. But obviously some of you had have your head stuck in  the sand talking out of your behind.

I do not know much about Che's life nor about Cuban July Revolution to make any comments about authenticity of historical moments shown in the movie. Benicio Del Toro was superb as Che. He looked like the real guy. I have yet to watch the second part. I myself am from a poor country, and kind of know how power-that-be always tries to maintain class differentials. Che's emphasis on education is based on the simple fact that uneducated are always easier to manipulate. The photography was great and so was the creative combination of black and white as well color photography to create the feeling of visiting two different era.
I recommend it.",1336694400,,721,4.596899224806202

I am not a communist, and these films evidence the attitude of the USA to Cuba from 1959 as a series of terrible misunderstandings and mistakes, starting with the Kennedy attempt to re-install the Mafia in Cuba at the bay of Pigs, through to the Clinton negociations, which were disavowed by Congress, in the 1990`s, all pushing Cuba into a corner.

3987947,2,B002U6DVO4,"The Ever lasting Myth of the 20th century....

Steven Soderbergh is not my favorite director. Derivative is a kind epithet,he seems to thrive on remakes,none of them very good. So, girding myself as it were] i decided to take on the ultimate myth making machine,Holywood, in the 20th centuries greatest martyr-myth Ernesto Che Guevara, in 2 parts. First off,Benicio Del Toro is magnificent, if too tall. He has tiny mannerisms down, the wearied look, the dirty tried small band left in Bolivia are almost heartbreaking. Almost...Im jumping ahead. The better half of the two films is the first, the ""conquest "" of Cuban against Batista's troops. Che is shown to have mucho cojones, fearlessly, recklessly leading battles, and yes brilliantly[he was a guerilla fighter extraordinaire`}. The movie spend almost all of iots time in the jungles and hills, and ends, abruptly.with a sermonette on a stolen car and revolutionary purity, over 100 miles outside of Havana. Guevara is shown as shrewd and compassionate, the poet warrior as it were. Part 2, which opens as does the first with a map[the first part of Cuba, the second of South America zeroing on Bolivia] starts with Ches' undercover departure from Cuba{disguised as a bald businessman, even his own fellows in the cuban central government did not recognize him!}He makes contact with various Bolivian revolutionaries,the head of the Bolivian communist party[played very well by Lou Diamond Phillips,eschewing his B movie career since La Bamba to show his acting chops are real}Franke Potente as Tania,the female martyr[and Gueverars 'muse and quite the screw-up, in this version, anyway],the French activist-journalist- Regis Debray character also appears, and his capture leads, inevitably, to Che's. The second half is sloooooooooow moving, with the small Band of fighters trying to convince the peasant population that they actually want a revolution{ convincing people that they want a revolution, that is a huge hint there,fellows. Sigh}..Still, Del Toro, who along with Jeffrey Wright is ,I believe,the finest actor working today, is magnificent in less than wonderful circumstances. The films coda, with Che on board a boat taking the original revolutionaries from Mexico to Cuba in the late 1950's shows a meditative Che standing by himself, looking outwards at the sea, than turning to watch Fidel interact with others,the perpetual outsider?Sigh The usual high level of Criterion is maintained here, the picture quality excellent, the subtitles improved from when I saw it in the  theatre The sound is excellent,the short film included is excellent, BTW....Che the executioner who would shoot a man at the drop of a hat and drop the hat himself is not here. Che, who killed a man then checked his pulse and noticed no difference [ever the scientist our Ernesto] is not here. Che the man who oversaw executions  after the revolution with nary a batted eye, he is not here. The virtuous champion Revolutionary Justice, He is Here!  The healer,the doctor-poet-freedom fighter is  Here. The revolutionary Messiah...even Guevara[if he possessed  any humor or self deprecation , which I have found no evidence} must chuckle at his image now, adorning wallets {irony] beer cans and the ubiquitous t-shirts, while his story, the whole story waits to be told. ...",1297900800,5,3320,5.242937853107344

3987949,5,B002U6DVO4,"Steven Soderberghs Che is a modern day masterpeice of a complex individual and idealist. While the film may be considered slow going by todays hollywood standards of action packed films it is a throwback to old time filmmaking. The documantary syling is great much of it filmed with hand held cameras. The cast is excellent. It is a surprise this film was even made and probaly wouldnt have if not for Benicio Del Toros backing as Producer and lead actor. While many people are detractors of Che characterizing him as a murderer I never hear them talk about the butcher Batista. The rampant poverty ,corruption,illiteracy,lack of healthcare.poor living standards,no political parties( i could go on and on)under Batista. While today Cuba has the most doctors per Capita in the world,everyone is literate and most of all Cuba is not a pawn of some imperialist giant like the US.It seems to be overlooked by most people the influence of the US and its embargo. The US tryed to assassinate Fidel over 200 times over a 40 year period. Now imagine if American leaders were the subject of Assasintaion attempts by a foreign power over 40 years. How would that influence our election and domestic life?Imagine a foregn power staging attacks on American soil trying to disrupt our food supply. In the 60s and 70s Several CIA officers left the CIA in disgust over the activities carried out by the CIA some in Cuba. People like Phillip Agee and Ralph Mcgee. Phillip Agee ended up living and dying in Cuba. Arguably things were better for the Cuban people under Fidel then ever before and would have been even better if not for the US embargo which has been denounced by most of the countries in the world as illegal and unethical. Which is why everybody else is allowed to visit Cuba but us. Cuba is the most popular Carribean vaction spot for Canadians but we wouldnt know that from the US corporate media system.

Sure Cuba is not perfect but its the first time poor Cubans got any consideration at all, that never happened under any other leader. And didn't happen under US tutelage.

3987950,1,B002U6DVO4,"This film reminds us of the stunning power of movies to alter historical fact and blind the clueless, fawning masses. Like Redford's The Motorcycle Diaries, this film gives the historically challenged a whitewashed version of reality, a reality where Che is a hero, and not a deranged murderer of innocents. Humberto Fontova helps us remember the real Che:

""When you saw the beaming look on Che's face as the victims were tied to the stake and blasted apart by the firing squad,"" said a former Cuban political prisoner Roberto Martin-Perez ... ""you saw there was something seriously, seriously wrong with Che Guevara."" As commander of the La Cabana execution yard, Che often shattered the skull of the condemned man (or boy) by firing the coup de grace himself. When other duties tore him away from his beloved execution yard, he consoled himself by viewing the slaughter. Che's second-story office in Havana's La Cabana prison had a section of wall torn out so he could watch his darling firing-squads at work.

Even as a youth, Ernesto Guevara's writings revealed a serious mental illness. ""My nostrils dilate while savoring the acrid odor of gunpowder and blood. Crazy with fury I will stain my rifle red while slaughtering any vencido that falls in my hands!"" This passage is from Ernesto Guevara's famous Motorcycle Diaries, though Robert Redford somehow overlooked it while directing his heart-warming movie.

The Spanish word vencido, by the way, translates into ""defeated"" or ""surrendered.""And indeed, ""the ""acrid odor of gunpowder and blood"" very, very rarely reached Guevara's nostrils from anything properly describable as combat. It mostly came from the close-range murders of defenseless men (and boys.) Carlos Machado was 15 years old in 1963 when the bullets from the firing squad shattered his body. His twin brother and father collapsed beside Carlos from the same volley. All had resisted Castro and Che's theft of their humble family farm, all refused blindfolds and all died sneering at their Communist murderers, as did thousands of their valiant countrymen.

The one genuine accomplishment in Che Guevara's life was the mass-murder of defenseless men and boys. Under his own gun dozens died. Under his orders thousands crumpled. At everything else Che Guevara failed abysmally, even comically.

During his Bolivian ""guerrilla"" campaign, Che split his forces whereupon they got hopelessly lost and bumbled around, half-starved, half-clothed and half-shod, without any contact with each other for 6 months before being wiped out. They ... seemed incapable of applying a compass reading to a map. They spent much of the time walking in circles and were usually within a mile of each other. During this blundering they often engaged in ferocious firefights against each other.

""You hate to laugh at anything associated with Che, who murdered so many defenseless men and boys,"" says Felix Rodriguez, the Cuban-American CIA officer who played a key role in tracking him down in Bolivia. ""But when it comes to Che as ""guerrilla"" you simply can't help but guffaw.""

I might add that the movie distorts/forgets/reinvents/reimagine's Che's eventual capture as well. As Fontova reminds us, this version is from none other than Fidel Castro himself! But ""Che, with a trifling flesh leg-wound (though Soderbergh's movie depicts Che's leg wound as ghastlier than Burt Reynolds' in Deliverance,) snuck away from the firefight, crawled towards the Bolivian soldiers doing the firing--then as soon as his he spotted two of them at a distance, stood and yelled: ""Don't Shoot! I'm Che! I'm worth more to you alive than dead!"" His captor's official Bolivian army records that they took from Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara: a fully-loaded PPK 9mm pistol.""

3987951,5,B002U6DVO4,I stumbled on this movie on cable half way thru the first disc. I knew instantly that I had to buy this movie. This amazingly accurate and well acted biography of Che Guevara is a must have for anyone who either admires Che or just wishes to know more about the Cuban Revolution and the continuing struggles in this hemisphere. Technically it's one of the most beautifully filmed movies I've ever seen.,1286323200,5,402,4.597222222222222
3987972,5,B002U6DVO4,"This movie comes in two parts that portray Che Guevara's later life in which he fought alongside Fidel Castro in the Cuban Revolution (part 1), and his leadership in the revolutionary struggles in Bolivia in the late 1960s (part 2). This movie makes you feel like you are in the jungle with bombs and explosives going off. ""Che"" doesn't pander to the pop icon that Guevara has become over the decades since his death. The movie tells a story of a man who died fighting for what he believed in. Another good movie to watch that tells a story about Guevara is ""The Motorcycle Diaries"" which is about Che's travels throughout South America as a younger man. Benicio Del Toro does a powerful and fantastic job as Guevara.""Che"" is definitely worth a look.",1283212800,2,750,4.646616541353383
3987973,5,B002U6DVO4,"I won't deny that this film is flawed, but BY GOD IS IT AMBITIOUS, and that speaks volumes for it.  Clocking in at nearly five hours, there is a lot of ground covered in Soderbergh's epic film, and while it isn't all covered as clearly or as effectively as one may want, it is all covered with an obvious tinge of respect and admiration for everything that this man stood for.

This film is thoroughly engaging.

Starting from his early years and then chronically his steady climb to the top, each part of this two-part documentary-style biopic works exceedingly well to establish a lot of who this man was, inside and out.  Like I mentioned, there are flaws here, some of them more obvious than others, but in the end they seem to fade away to reveal an extremely well crafted look at a man we may not know a lot about.

The films first part fluctuates between Che's Cuban campaign and his visit to New York City.  The way that Soderbergh shifts between focal points adds a stylistic layer to the film, with crisp black and white imagery that permeates the New York visit, illuminating it so-to-speak.  The grit that is exposed in the guerrilla warfare is devastatingly real.  While Soderbergh maintains a very clear and visceral imagery, there is such authentic carnage captured here.  Nothing looks artificial or embellished.  Every gunshot, explosion, wound...everything feels very real, which only adds to the documentary approach to the films execution.  The second part makes a drastic jump to the later years of Che's work, dropping him in Bolivia where he met his end.  This section lacks the style of the first (the focal shifts are not as evident or as polished) but it maintains the slick yet authentic attention to detail that made the first section so compelling.

There is a lot of material that is not broached here, which leads to a less than complete picture of who Che really was, but there is so much passion stirred within the moments caught here that it becomes almost insignificant a complaint.  I would have liked to see Che made out to be a more morally complex character, but from a pure filmmaking standpoint, this film is close to perfection.  This is a classic example of bending to Hollywood standards without compromising artistic integrity.  Soderbergh certainly makes a film he's undoubtedly proud of, but he also makes something that is curiously accessible.  One may balk at that statement, stating that a film with a 4+ hour running time is not accessible, but I beg to differ.

The performances are very well executed here, but one thing to make clear is that this is not an actor's film.  Benicio Del Toro is ravishingly good here, but it is a very distant performance.  The focal point of the film is NOT the actor but the story being told, which I commend (even if my whole love for film stems from the performances emitted on screen) because it allows the audience to remove themselves from `Del Toro' and focus on Che.  That said, every actor here works well within his strengths to create a cohesive and approachable chemistry with one another.  This nature of acting contributes to the films authenticity and gritty rawness.

This is not a film for everyone.  That should be clear.  But, if you are intrigued by historical epics that capture the heart and spirit of a time, a place and a man then this film should captivate you.  It may not be a `one-sitting' kind of film (I lounged out this weekend and soaked it all in at once, but I understand if breaking it up in parts is an easier swallow) but it is a film that you should sit through at least once.  While I may not have walked away knowing all there is to know about Che, I did walk away understanding his journey, his struggle and his viewpoint a whole lot clearer.",1281916800,5,3769,4.628571428571429
3987974,3,B002U6DVO4,"The first paragraph and other portions of this review have been used in other DVD reviews of Che Guevara and fit here as well:

""On more than one occasion I have mentioned that ""Che"" Guevara, as icon and legend, despite his left Stalinist politics (at best) and the political gulf that separated him from those who fought, and fight, under the banner of Leon Trotsky and the Fourth International, was, and is, a justifiably appealing revolutionary militant for the world's youth to consider. A number of films have come out over the years that portray one or another aspect of the ""Che"" personality. Here the central thrust of the film is the creation of ""Che"" as a revolutionary cadre in the guerrilla warfare movement that dominated much of the radical political action of the 1960s, in the wake of the success and survival of the Cuban revolution in the face of American Yankee imperialism.""

Unlike other films of Che `s exploits that have been reviewed in this space this monster, two-disc, four and one half film is strictly a homage to his skills as a revolutionary guerilla fighter out in the bush first in the hills of the Sierra Maestre in Cuba and then, tragically and fatally, in rural Bolivia. Some footage is thrown in, seemingly as relief, from interviews and an occasional speech but the heart of the film, and probably the reason that Che will long be remembered by generations of youth is that fight to turn himself from a ""rich kid"" doctor to a struggler against imperialism wherever he found it.

That story, whatever, the political differences we might have is appealing. What is not, in a long film, is the concentration on every military maneuver and every action in every campaign in Cuba and Bolivia. This short changes Che as a political man with definite politic views, hard views about the nature of the future communist society, that came to the fore in the period when he was a Cuban state official and responsible for helping to run the government under the guns, real and economic, of American imperial attack.

In that sense this film does not work. Moreover, in contrast to Eduardo Noriega's ""Che"" in which that actor in his mannerisms, his good and manly looks, and in his earnestness (no pun intended) to free the Americas of the Yankee beast was Che Bernico Del Toro seems a bit ponderous.  However, the film is saved a bit when ""Che"" and Del Toro are reprieved in the Bolivia-centered  second disc  when we get a better look at his determination to end up where he started, as a guerrilla fighter extraordinaire fighting against the world's injustices.

That, my friends, today is refreshingly appealing. That said, though ""Che"" deserved a better fate that to be caught out in the bush in Bolivia. And here, as I have noted elsewhere, is where the irony (and the political differences) between us comes in. What the hell was he doing in the Bolivian bush, of all places in Bolivia when they was a working class (mainly miners) who had a history of extreme militancy and readiness to do class battles against the state (and have done so since then). ""Che"", mainly deserves his status as icon, as a personal exemplar, but a whole generation of militants in Latin America and elsewhere got torn up to no purpose based on that wrong strategic assumption. That is the real lesson of the film.",1275091200,2,3325,4.720689655172414
3987975,4,B002U6DVO4,"Like a Fassbinder film, one must see CHE as one film with a pause between 2 parts. During that pause the audience will be rearranging the time sequences, inserting its own knowledge of the Cuban Revolution, and putting together the doctor/guerrillero/leader that part 1 ends with. As soon as part 2 begins, the audience might think that it has missed a time frame and will be forced to quickly remember what was Che's role in the formation of this new society. Then painfully the audience will follow Che to Bolivia and his attempt to organize a true popular force against another oppressive government.

There is very little cheering here; men and women die in terrible conditions; victory is so distant that one may never see it. But Benicio's Che is the closest to a flesh and blood human being we will ever see. We feel we have at last met Che Guevara and want to warn him, protect him, and take care of someone who believed so hard in his ideals that he could dispense with his life to pursue an ideal.",1274832000,4,1007,4.532967032967033

3987977,5,B002U6DVO4,"Steven Soderbergh's ""Che"" is one of those rare films where you'll either like it or hate it. It is not a conventional biography, it isn't even a conventional movie. Soderbergh is not interested in presenting a loud, thundering film about the icon Che Guevara, but instead he wants to provide an almost scientific analysis of a man driven by an idea and the campaigns he engaged in. Like Sofia Coppola's ""Marie Antoinette,"" this isn't a movie interested in bold political statements, it is simply trying to present events as they are known to have happened. It doesn't matter much whether you're a right-winger or a leftist, Soderbergh doesn't champion or attack Che's political views or goals, he simply presents a man's actions.

Benicio Del Toro (Traffic, 21 Grams) plays Guevara with an uncanny resemblance and a powerful presence. We meet him in Mexico City in the 1950s where he meets a group of Cuban exiles plotting the overthrow of the US-backed dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista. It is here that Guevara meets Fidel Castro (played by Mexican actor Demian Bichir) who lectures him on the dire conditions for Cuba's poor and convinces him to join the revolutionary expedition sailing back to the island on the famous Granma boat. Soderbergh intercuts the jungle campaign in Cuba with black and white passages capturing Guevara's 1964 visit to the UN General Assembly where he delivered one of the most blistering anti-colonial speeches of the era. This sections feel large in scope while the Cuban scenes feel very intimate as Guevara trains guerrillas, engages in firefights with Batista's troops and brings medical services to poor villages where many people had never seen a doctor before in their lives. Soderbergh captures everything with a great air of authenticity in the accents, settings, locations and anyone who has visited Cuba or the Caribbean will immediately recognize the unique sense of humor expressed by the characters. It is in this first half where we see Che taste victory as the Cuban Revolution spreads and culminates in the battle of Santa Clara. Batista falls and the experience convinces Che of the legitimacy of armed struggle. The second half of the film follows Che into Bolivia, a more arid landscape with an indigenous majority population living under another brutal regime. The Bolivia episode is the other side of the coin from the Cuban Revolution, here the struggle to spread a doctrine of armed revolution runs into various roadblocks due to many conditions including culture clashes, inter-clashes within leftist circles and the heavy involvement of the CIA in tracking down Che's expedition. The Bolivia episode feels more fast-paced than Cuba, but also features a stunning attention to detail. The episode ends with Che's execution at the hands of the Bolivian army and CIA, and in its somber tone, we can still see how the man transformed into legend.

""Che"" is first and foremost a document, an attempt by Soderbergh to chronicle in as much detail and realism as possible the EXPERIENCE of being a guerrilla in the field, the long hours of debate and boredom punctuated by moments of violence and danger. Like ""The Battle Of Algiers"" the film feels almost like a documentary instead of as a dramatic narrative. Those looking for a more romantic, adventurous trip should stick with Walter Salles' excellent ""The Motorcycle Diaries"" about Guevara's journey through Latin America as a young medical student. Soderbergh's film is more challenging because it doesn't provide easy answers or plot points, it forces the viewers to think for themselves and form their own opinions and conclusions. The film doesn't make bold statements about the Cuban Revolution or socialist politics, and yet it forces the audience to ponder political theories and history more than the average, more straight forward biographical movie. ""Che"" provides a more challenging discussion about revolutionary politics than ""Braveheart,"" or Andy Garcia's right-wing ""The Lost City"" which provided a more spoon-fed, almost tabloid take on the Cuban Revolution and its participants.  Does this mean the film is simply too academic? It depends on what you're looking for. Che Guevara is one of those historical characters that has become such an icon or symbol that many people wear the t-shirt without ever bothering to read anything about the man, this goes for both those who admire him and those who hate him. Even those who are just used to seeing Fidel Castro as an evening news item waving at crowds in his green fatigues will see the icon stripped down to a guerrilla commander trying to strategize and reconcile various parties, groups and opinions about how to carry out a revolutionary change in government. One value of the script by Peter Buchman is that he doesn't reduce these men to just historical titans spewing grand speeches, we instead see the bare bones of politics and how behind the flashy posters and berets, Guevara and Castro were also debating the hows and whens of everything from land reform to foreign policy.

The look of the film is toned down and yet very lush. Soderbergh used the Red One camera for both episodes of ""Che"" and the result is very impressive, a visual clarity with some of the same grain and depth as film. There are grand vistas in the Cuba chapter, with lush sequences in beautiful jungle terrains. The Bolivia section looks arid and cold, with rich shadows evoking a campaign headed for a tragic end. It was a wise choice to film the UN sequences in black and white film stock, they feel incredibly authentic.

Without a doubt ""Che"" features the best performance ever delivered by Benicio Del Toro who fully embodies the character, the fact that he did not recieve an Oscar nomination is a complete travesty. He brilliantly changes looks, physique and switches from a man pumped with the idealism of a born rebel to a man struggling in a terrain that is not bending to his will. He never overplays Guevara and brings a real human dimension to a role which could so easily be overdone. Demian Bichir is impressive as Castro, masterfully capturing the famous accent, the mannerisms and yes, the cigar stance.

""Che"" is the kind of bold experiment many directors would be afraid of attempting. It breaks many rules and doesn't bow to the demands of cheap commercialism, and yet is always fascinating. This isn't the kind of movie to watch in order to avoid reading the biography, instead it is the kind of movie that might force you to go out and seek further reading on the man. Both sections come here with brilliant commentary tracks by journalist Jon Lee Anderson, author of the great biography ""Che: A Revolutionary Life."" Anderson provides excellent analysis and historical information that adds to the fascination of the movie, for those who find it hard to grasp the movie at first, the commentary tracks are of great help. In the DVD extra features Soderbergh laments that maybe the time for a movie like ""Che"" has already passed because nobody actually DISCUSSES films anymore, people appear to simply seek escapism and nothing more. This is certainly not a film for ""Avatar"" fans, or at least for those who ONLY like movies in that vein, but for the curious with an eye for excruciating detail, ""Che"" is an experiment worth checking out.",1271721600,55,7314,4.97140522875817
3987978,2,B002U6DVO4,"Che is a four-hour plus film that really tests the patience of the average viewer.  The film falls way short of reasonable expectations on several levels.

First, the film starts with a fully radicalized Che; with no background story on how the privileged doctor Ernesto became revolutionary communist Che.  Without the back story of his evolution, it's hard to understand ""where he is coming from"".

Second, the film ignores his allegedly extremely violent manner and bloodthirsty executions he ordered on thousands of Cubans who were thought to be enemies of the state after Castro came into power.

Third, the film ignores his journey to the Congo.  Something interesting must have happened there.

Fourth, the film spends hours showing Che and his band of guerillas wandering about the Bolivian mountains.  Not that interesting.

I could go on, but despite the good acting by Benicio Del Toro, and some good cinematography, the movie is ultimately quite a disappointment.",1271116800,4,975,5.198717948717949

Firstly, the movie takes itself with leaden seriousness - which is to say dullness and excruciatingly slow pacing.  If you're gonnna pump out leftish propaganda, make sure it's not boring leftish propaganda.  What's that you say?  If the movie were remotely entertaining then people would assume it wasn't IMPORTANT?!?  You got a point there.
Long story short, the movie was sepia toned, but only because I stained the screen with my own foeces.

Ok, I see some of you ingrates are spamming this thing of mine with unhelpful votes.  In which case, hey, go ahead.  Be my guest.  Subject yourself to 4.5 hours of this Steven Soderbergh ""joint.""
See, the problem with Soderbergh is that he is the type of artist who can't tell when he's on and when he's off.  Maybe success has spoiled Rock Hunter, but then again his early stuff is just as hit-and-miss.  Soderbergh either has no capacity for self-criticism, or he likes the sound his own film makes as it goes through the projector, or both.  In any case, please, subject yourself to this drivel as you sit there with a look of solemn political concentration on your liberal face, at times being heard to utter, ""Hmmmm... the people have no health care, Fidel says?  That can't be right.  I guess it's just a good thing Cuba had an humanitarian like Castro around to treat everybody real decent.""
Probably what happened is that due to the reverse-blacklist situation in today's Hollywood, Soderbergh's publicist told him he'd better pump out some pinko nonsense on the double or he'd soon find himself directing junior high scare films about jerking off with a belt around your neck.
Which reminds me.  I had a dream last night that I was watching Kill Bill Volume 2 and David Carridine's self-asphyxiation was integral to the plot.

8:29 PM.  For better treatment of similar subject matter, I recommend Woody Allen's Bananas.
In other news, I'm seriously considering getting a medical marijuana card.  Kids today cannot begin to comprehend what it was like to grow up in the marijuana blight of the 1980s.  Back then the idea of walking into a ""pharmacy"" and scoring some ""medicine"" was like an impossible dream.  It would appear the dam is beginning to burst; and all Soderburgh can do is make snore-fests about Che Guevara?!?  Something pivotal is happening in California right now.  Marijuana is de-facto legalized, subject to certain flimsy controls, such as a doctor's appointment where the diagnosis is at the outset uncertain, but the course of treatment is already agreed upon.  Now that's my kind of doctor.  (To be clear, I wouldn't go to a regular doctor if I broke my leg.  I'd just suck it up, drink some whiskey and tie some PVC pipe to my thigh with some duct tape and move on.)
Anyhoo, I spent the afternoon fixing my goddam pool filter, dropped a vise-grip pliers down in the cannister just as I was finally done putting it all back together so then I had to fish that out with a magnet taped to the end of a stick and believe me that's not as fun as it sounds.

Often, you can spot these people going off into the world of fanaticism (please see Sean Penn's latest declaration against freedom of the press in Venezuela).
  The film is a melodramatic biopic depicting Che Guevara as some great man. The film couldn't possibly be more idealist and fawning toward this supposed hero. Given the breadth of the film (it almost literally does go on forever), it is easy to assume that this was Soderbergh's answer to Patton (or the Passion of Christ). While this movie is short on facts it is also short on rational critical thinking. It is easy to see why so little of this film can be based on facts because so few Cubans critical of Castro and the revolution in the 60's actually lived to tell the truth. This is the nature of totalitarian societies and Hollywood for some reason champions the propaganda from these countries and laps up everything they say as truth, from healthcare on down.
  If anything, people should see this film for what it is, another Hollywood billboard displaying childlike politics in ignorance of the facts. Be glad we still live in a country where we can choose not to herald these people as icons of our society if we do not want to.
  Since America is not yet the dream that the Castros, Guevaras, Chavezs,  Bin Ladens, Maos, Stalins and the Hitlers of the world murdered for, we can still be critical of those who align themselves with their vision.
  I intend to boycott any film done by any of the people associated with this picture, will never see any films produced by 20th Century Fox and, IFC Films; and I most certainly will not buy this or any Criterion Collection DVD again and I urge you to do the same.

3988014,5,B002U6DVO4,"For a four-hour biopic, ""Che"" leaves out a lot.  There's nothing of his life pre-Fidel, little of his tenure as a Cuban government official, and nothing of his ill-fated campaign in the Congo.  The first film is about the Cuban revolution, but leaves out the beginning and end--no embattled landing on the beach, no triumphant march into Havana.  Except for the occasional brief speech, there's not even much to do with politics.  It certainly would have been interesting to see the other aspects of Che's life, but that's not what this film is about. Essentially, this film is solely about Che the day-to-day guerrilla leader.  It tells the same story twice--once ending in victory, once ending in defeat.  You could argue that this film is four hours of guys running around in the woods with guns--not inaccurate, but also unfair.  I was surprised by how much it kept my attention.  Watching ""Che,"" you get a real sense of what it's like to be a guerrilla.  You sense the fatigue, the fear, and the will to keep going anyway.  I was never once bored.

I should say that I've only seen ""Che"" in the theater, so I can't review the DVD features.

Also, I wanted to say a few quick things in response to the negative reviewers.  Yes, Che is guilty of crimes, and no, Cuba is not a paradise.  But there's a reason why millions of Latin Americans hold him in near-religious regard.  Here was a man born to a life of privilege, yet who gave up everything to fight, suffer and die for the poor and destitute.  We can and should question his actions and his ideology, but we can't question his selflessness and his commitment.  Besides, if we can forgive the American founding fathers for practicing slavery and genocide in their quest to create a new social order, then we can surely forgive Che's crimes, which are miniscule in comparison.

3988015,5,B002U6DVO4,"If you liked the Steven Soderbergh and Benecio Del Toro of Traffic, you'll love Che: Parts I and II. Brilliant direction and acting again, and this time with the subject matter of a person as interesting as their combined talents deserve to handle. Maybe some of these reviewers were expecting a different kind of biopic, but what you get is an amazing film, biopic or no. The tragedy of Che is a human story almost unparalleled, and with Soderbergh at the helm, we get the story in its most humane. Highly recommended.",1264377600,5,519,4.6521739130434785
3988016,3,B002U6DVO4,"Its difficult to know even how to describe this film. Its of course not really one film but two seperate films done in different styles. Its not really a biopic because it doesn't offer anything like a biography of the subject. Its hard to tell on the surface what the intended focus for the films was even supposed to be. But whatever it is, its a well crafted film produced on what appears to have been a very limited budget.

The first half of the film covers exclusively Guevara's military involvement in the Cuban Revolution with bits added in that having him looking back during a trip to New York. Its all well shot, but its not very insightful and its incredibly repetitive. Its like a war film stripped of nearly all dramatic content and personal presence. Its just action shot after action shot.

And though it makes the point itself, it fails to understand that the revolution was made after the military victory and that dramatically, the pieces of his life during that period were far more interesting than an endless series of marches back-and-forth through the jungle.

The film is also caught up in Che's vision of himself as a revolutionary fighter. It turns him into the same sort of cipher that the man's own works and ideology do. No family life. No personal life. All boots and marching.

The second part covers the end of Guevera's life in Bolivia. The main point being that his plans were naive, he refused to listen to others and his whole campaign was pointless. Thing of it is, it takes two hours of almost nothing happening for the film to make this point. They talk. They march. They march. They talk. As far as I can remember, there is all of one ambush. And for all the talk of the suffering poor of Bolivia, we see none of them. In the end, its almost like a documentary of a year-long camping trip where nothing happens.

We are supposed to be impressed by the government's reaction and American training/assistance in hunting him down. But sending an army to hunt down what seems like 20 guys aimlessly wandering around in the unpopulated hills stealing food from hungry people isn't very impressive. Sometimes it reminded me of the last half hour of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid.

Thing of it is that in the end, Che as rebel leader fighting for the revolution isn't very impressive for all the mythology associated with it. He comes across as a naive amatuer in bad health all the time. One wonders of the image that sold all those posters and shirts has more to do with the media image than the man.

Whats really missing in the film is any kind of Charisma in Che. He comes across in the film as the kind of guy who would be shot by his own men. He doesn't do anything to inspire people. Its mostly boring doctrinaire speeches delivered in a totally depersonalized manner.

The visual construction and craft of the film is a great accomplishment. And the actors are mostly ok with what they are given to work with. Its great especially given the budget of the
project. But I think the structure and script of the two films missed the mark. If the film errs, it errs in going to far in the direction of stark boring realism. The life of a fighter may mostly consist of boring walks from place to place, but thats not necessarily what people want to see in a drama.

The most perversely interesting part of the DVD is to be found in the extras. The people responsible for the film attempt to explain why they excluded all the events that happened after the fighting stopped in Cuba. The explainations are lame. We are told that it would have been boring to see a period of time when Che supervised the execution of hundreds. We are told that they left out lots of things from the film and this was one of them. We are told that when Che kills two rapist bandit deserters from his own unit, that shows his *terrible ruthless side* and made up for the fact that the executions after the revolution were not shown.

Then there is the basic ignorance (I don't know what else to call it) about Che's life that many of the core people involved show. They talk about Boliva being Che's ""home ground"". But Bolivia was as alien to him as the Congo. The core players revel in their ignorance of Bolvia and repeat the old myth that Che's failure was due to the leader of the communists not dropping to his knees to Che. Everyone involved seems to forget that Fidel led the Cuban Revolution, not Che. And that Che could not led the Cuban revolution.

And then there is an explaination of why many of the meetings (in English) have stilted dialog. They appear to have been written based on telegram summaries of what was discussed at actual meetings. The fact that people don't talk like an executive summary seems to have gone right over their heads. And then there is their ignorant obsesion with Vietnam. They seem to not to know anything about American activities in Latin America during the era. They don't know about the Dominican Republic. They don't know about Brazil. They don't know about the wave of coups in the region.

And then there are the horrible rigors of filming in that remote third world place known as Spain. Filming in Spain was almost impossible because it simply lacks the amenities for such an important group of people.

Then they complain about people not universally supporting the film and bashing the state of Cinema. Complaints about the Cannes film festival not falling all over them. And their ""shock"" that almost nobody was willing to give them a massive advance on US distribution of a spanish-language four hour film. Like everything about the film, its all too much.",1264118400,6,5633,4.559841740850643
3988017,5,B002U6DVO4,"Che is ultimately a study in contrasts. What worked in Cuba did not work in Bolivia. Soderbergh's film illustrates the differences. With a widescreen aspect ratio, Soderbergh opens things up in Part One and this is particularly evident during the battle scenes. In Part Two, this all changes, as the smooth camerawork is replaced with hand-held cameras and a more standard aspect ratio which creates a claustrophobic feel and look. The long takes and deliberately slow pace may frustrate some expecting a more traditional biopic but I found it a welcome change from the cookie cutter mentality of most Hollywood depictions of history. With Che, Soderbergh has created an unusual biopic that does its best to not try and manipulate you into feeling one way or another about the revolutionary. Instead, it shows two very different examples of the man's philosophies put into practice and how they played out - one a success and the other a failure.

The first disc includes an audio commentary for Part One by Jon Lee Anderson, chief consultant on Che and author of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Che-Guevara-A-Revolutionary-Life/dp/0802135587/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life</a>. He starts off by calling Che a ""hippie rebel,"" and a product of the 1960s. He talks about the corruption and decadence of Cuba under Batista and how this provoked men like Che and Fidel Castro to start a revolution. Anderson provides extensive historical background to what we are watching which fills in a lot of gaps and often explains what is being shown, putting it into context.

Also included is a theatrical trailer.

The second disc sees Anderson return for an audio commentary for Part Two. He explains Che's fascination with Bolivia at an early age and why he chose that country to start a revolution. He talks about the political conditions in Bolivia that made it ripe for a revolution. Like he did with Part One, Anderson provides the backstory and elaborates in detail on what we are watching.

The third and final disc starts off with ""Making Che,"" a 50-minute documentary that takes a look at how the film came together. It started with producer Laura Bickford and her interested in Jon Lee Anderson's book. She got Benicio del Toro involved and they spent years doing research and deciding what part of his life to depict. The film's screenwriters talk about the challenge of condensing so many events into one film and so Soderbergh decided to split it up into two films. The director explains his depiction of Che, including the omission of the man's more questionable actions, and his approach to the film. This is an excellent, in-depth look.

There are ten deleted scenes from Part One with optional commentary by Soderbergh. He puts this footage in context and explains why it was cut. These scenes provide some insight into Che and it's nice to be able to see them.

Also included are four deleted scenes from Part Two with optional commentary by Soderbergh. Much of this footage illustrates Che's philosophy of guerrilla warfare.

""End of a Revolution"" is a 1968 documentary about the aftermath of Che's failed revolution in Bolivia, the origins of it and a look at the forces that prevented it. The featurette begins with stills of Che's dead body and a journalist describing the scene, his voice full of emotion. The doc does a nice job of profiling Bolivia and its people; for example, we see the brutal living and working conditions of the tin miners.

""Interviews from Cuba"" features interviews with participants and historians of the Cuban Revolution conducted by producer Laura Bickford and actor Benicio del Toro. The participants talk about how they met Che and their impressions of him. They also discuss their views on the revolution. The historians talk about the key influences on the revolution and take us through significant moments of it.

Finally, there is ""Che and the Digital Cinema Revolution!"" Soderbergh's film was the first feature to use the Red digital camera because of its quality and versatility in the terrain he would be shooting in. He did not have a lot of time to shoot Che and needed a camera that would allow him to shoot fast and not require a lot of artificial light. The cameras almost weren't ready for the start of principal photography but Soderbergh stuck to his guns was able to get them just in time. This doc does a nice job taking a look at the challenges of using the Red camera and how it was the ideal technology for this particular film.",1263427200,9,4565,4.996052631578947
3988018,1,B002U6DVO4,"In the closing scene of Part I, after Batista fled Cuba, a rebel tells Che he wants to go home as the Revolution is over. Che replies that it is the war that has ended and the Revolution has just started.  This four hours+ movie covers strictly the fighting in Cuba and Bolivia. It is two distinct films in one, each with very different  moods and outcomes. Part I  perpetuates the illusion of Che a hero. Part II transforms the idea of the hero into a martyr.

In the 2.5 years in Cuba,  the fighting is idealized and pure pro communist propaganda.  where no none challenges the Che's authority, he guides the rebels and pontificates about the love true rebels feel for humankind. Their mission does not come across as particularly dangerous or difficult. Segments of Che's fighting in Sierra Maestra--shot in color-- are juxtaposed with his speech at the UN in 1964--shot in black and white. This is an effective way of engaging the audience.

In Part II,  the fighting in Bolivia requires sacrifices and it is very dangerous.  The mood here is dark and captures Che's failure to unify the various rebel factions. The grayish and brownish landscape is perfect for setting a mood of despair and bleakness. Here Del Toro come across  as a cynic and looks a little thuggish.

Besides being a work of pure pro communist propaganda, the other flaw is that Che does not radiate charisma. In addition, there is no character development: he does not learn from his experiences as a Comandante and we do not see him maturing or becoming wiser. Che just is and never changes.

Bechir's portrayal of Fidel Castro is, at best, a poor caricature (Jacobo Morales' portrayal of Fidel in Woody Allen's ""Bananas"" if far more convincing). The rest of the cast is forgettable.  The  rebel mestizos are a hint that this film was not shot in Cuba or the Caribbean.  The domestic races in this area are either white, mulattos, blacks or creoles.  The rebels neither express themselves nor sound like Cubans. The absence of Cuban music is disorienting.

This film covers exclusively the fighting in Cuba and Bolivia and, therefore excludes all the misgivings of the Revolution. One worth noting is how Castro got rid of Che. Their falling goes back to the fighting at the Sierra Maestra and Che's reassignment to Santa Clara are well documented.

Early in the Revolution Che, along with other Comandates were gradually starting to steal Castro's limelight or openly disagreeing with him.  Castro took swift and brutal action in eliminating these enemies of the Cuban people.  For example, Camilo Cienfuegos disappeared in an airplane ""accident"" while Huber Matos, one of the lucky ones, was found guilty of treason and sedition and sentenced to 20 years in prison.

How would Castro get rid of his most famous Comandante? Che's letter to Castro explaining why he disappeared from Cuba in 1965 notwithstanding, it was Castro who sent him to fight in Bolivia. Once there, he gradually cut off his support and left him to die.  It was a combination of the U.S. military assistance--equipment and money,  the Bolivian army's determination to eliminate Che and Castro's negligence that ultimately caused his demise. According to this film, Che is shot like a rabid dog. We see what Che sees at the moment of death-- a soldier's boot, out of focus-- as the camera fades to black.  As his body is taken away in a helicopter, we hear a plaintive song with an Andean flavor. Only here is the music approachable.

This inferior film has not gone unnoticed  In 2008, Del Toro received the best actor award at the Cannes Film Festival. In 2009, he received a prestigious award in Cuba, and in addition, the Goya Award for the best Spanish actor in a leading role. It is clear that these institutions admire Che. What's it not so clear is why they bestowed so many honors on such blatant propaganda? Are they so desperate for attention?

In conclusion, this film is two distinct films which share one title.  Part I is better structured through juxtaposition of two different periods in El Che's life and holds our interest, The fighting in Cuba is  positive--if idealized-- and is, for lack of a better word, successful.  Part II captures the dark and negative mood of Che's failure to get any substantial support in Bolivia.

This is Steven Soderbergh paying homage to a controversial figure while deluding himself by trying  desperately to cling  to a myth.  It is a work of propaganda celebrating  a dark figure. In spite of all claims to the contrary,  this film  is not about man fighting for fairness, justice, equality, education and medical care for the neglected poor peasants.  It is about a common bandit who, ironically, helped establish another dictatorship in Cuba. Ultimately, we are presented with the themes of ""ilusin y desengao"" or illusion and finding out the truth. Che has been dead for almost 50 years. It is time to embrace  the truth.",1259712000,16,4926,4.805225653206651
3988019,3,B002U6DVO4,"This is a review of the 2-disc version, each disc about 135 minutes long, in Spanish with English subtitles. There are no bonus materials on either of these discs.

Much of the first disc is taken up showing Fidel's ragtag band fighting through the Sierra Maestra Mountains of Cuba, and finally, seemingly against all odds, triumphing over Batista's troops. Most of the second disc shows Che and his even more ragtag band fighting in the jungles of Bolivia, hoping to bring the revolution to the campesinos there.

However through all this jungle fighting, you really won't get to know much about Che himself. Che is the main thing missing from ""Che."" This ambitious movie project conveys little sense of what sort of person he was. Scenes of the jungle struggle are inter-cut with scenes showing Guevara speaking officially, often before U.N. assemblages. But his speeches here are rhetoric. They're all boxy abstraction and give no sense of what Guevara might have sounded like on a personal level. Or perhaps he was all revolutionary abstraction. But we don't get to know that.

It's not that I was looking for tabloid-style revelations of his personal life here. In fact, I was glad the movie didn't touch on any romantic involvements with female compatriots in the struggle, nor attempt to probe any childhood psychological underpinnings to his commitment.

However, I would have liked to know, for example, if Guevara's decision to go to Bolivia was based on any feeling he had that Castro was betraying the principles of the revolution. Did he want to start anew, with hopes of founding a movement that didn't slip immediately into its own form of dictatorship? I gather there is a lot of controversy over Che's and Fidel's opinions of each other. But you won't get any insight into their relationship from this movie.

Part of the problem is that the film was shot in such a fragmented style. The first disc is especially episodic - with its flash-forwards to the U.N. and then its return to various jungle skirmishes. Most scenes are less than half a minute long and deal with the surfaces of the action. It's always a glimpse - then cut to something else.

While the photography gives the viewer a feel for what it must have been like to struggle through dense, mosquito-infested underbrush, it doesn't distinctly show faces. Faces are obscured by hair growth and shadow. So it's often difficult to know if you're looking at Che or one of his confederates. You don't know who's who, and Benecio del Toro's striking resemblance to Che gets wasted.

The film mercifully slows down a little in the second half. We hear Che deliver a heartfelt speech about human dignity to some peasants in a Bolivian church, in an attempt to win them over to the revolutionary cause. For the first time, the viewer gets a sense of why Che's life and chronicle might have been important. But it's too little, too late. I think there are probably more revealing movies and documentaries out there to acquaint viewers with Che and to tackle the question of whether he was hero or villain - or a combination of both.",1259625600,2,3103,4.799625468164794
3988020,5,B002U6DVO4,"before watching CHE-1)forget the words liberal and conservative,left and right,2)try to forget Castro's repressive regime that that proved communism does not work,no matter how many beret-ed martyrs you try to pan off on the world in a effort to soothe the loss of a gangland island paradise. 3)Forget that Che was just as political as Castro ever was. 4)Forget the fact that Castro's regime,began as a typical communist take over,with executions,torture,and death to any enemy of the state real or framed,guilty or innocent. 5)Forget Castro and Che as about as materialistic a pair as you will ever see,those green,guerrilla,jungle fighter,power to the people,24-7 uniforms oozed vanity rather than the political consience of revolution...forget all that stuff,put it out of your mind..watch the movie.
  1)Soderbergh's vision of Che as seen through the lense of a camera plays like a documentary,shakey camera etc...the scenes are mostly shot,standing back,which is thoughtful,even frame friendly. Each frame is lush and crammed full with that which Soderbergh envisioned to be the character of the film Che,making the jungle,the sky,the weapons,the asthma attacks,the heat,the sounds..necessary if not passive cast members. That  says a lot about Sodersbergh's John Ford'ish abilities when it comes to, presentation relative to the suspense,of the story to be told,relative to landscape,distance,fatigue,combat..,relative to his choice of the image to be packed into a frame of film.
2)Che is long,almost 5 hours,some say it is too slow(not enough explosions,flying saucers,droids etc.)Some say it does not look right(not David Lean'ish enough)....Che has to be long in order for Soderbergh to unfold,lay-out and give us a feel for Che's dirty,sweaty,dangerous,neurotic life. Yes,it is  about revolution,and all that shallow political phrasing that could be sold in the 60's,but Che the film also showes us the slow,tedious aspects of camp life,where food and water are precious commodities,and death is the snap of a finger away,making paranoid,anxious revolutionaries encamped in the heat,humidity and misery indicitive of the garden that grows paranoia,the jungle. Che is not too long,it is just long enough.
3)Che is one of the most ambitious films ever made,it's kind of hard to fathom a 5 hr flick produced in today's cut-budget climate,and if that isn't enough,it's artistic,serious,and stresses the craft and infinite possibilities of filmaking. It is Soderbergh's and Del Toro's brave,artistic gamble that  probably won't pay-off. It is the type of important film that drives wanna-be filmmakers to work harder,out of jealousy as much as anything else.
4)Benicio Del Toro is great as you've heard
5)Part 2,the Bolivian episode,will wear at you,Castro's stalking presence can be felt as Che fails miserably to organize a Bolivian working- folks revolution. Che's asthma attack is suffocating as the stark Bolivian Countryside. It's weary-some to watch,a not-much-of-a-good-guy,failing,with doom all around,getting what he deserves,at the cost of becoming some post Beatle,post JFK,LSD,60's,you must be cool cause you look good in a berat,misunderstood,fictionalized, martyr,which is of course what he became.
6)Part 1 is about the Cuban revolution,Che,Castro,their buddies,i found part 1 facinating to watch,and has a great ending as Che makes some of  his guys return a car they stole as they head for Havana to cash in on Castro's infamous regimes's birth.",1259280000,7,3469,5.6487523992322455
