921358,3,6304676107,Great plot to this film.  The acting starts out being a bit medicore but the actors get comfortable and seem to settle down. The relationship and character development are quite intriguing and compelling.  It is a film  that you think in the beginning is not worth the time to watch but end up  hoping it doesn't end. It is definitely a film I want to add to my  collection.,916963200,,374,4.36231884057971
921441,3,6304676107,"This movie takes a little time to get going, as the initial scenes are kind of stagey and the various characters seem interchangeable.  But the direction becomes more relaxed and assured before too long, and the different characters soon emerge as unique, complex individuals that we come to care about.  But be warned, this movie is a major talk-fest, so if you don't like long conversations about numerous personal and political issues, this DVD might not be for you.  Myself, I ultimately found the writing incisive and the banter pretty interesting and involving.  But I think even the film makers said at some point, ""Enough talk!"", because in the last fifteen minutes or so the movie dramatically shifts from the intellectual to the physical.  In other words, you might want to make sure the kids are in the other room once the various characters start acting on their feelings and making up.",1053475200,12,898,4.881578947368421

921443,4,6304676107,The director's cut on DVD is so much better than the video.  This is the story of seven college friends who come together for the Bris of one couple's baby.  Some of them haven't seen each other in fifteen years.  They spend the weekend in the house where they spent their radical college years reminiscing about the past and dealing with old baggage.  I especially enjoyed the relationship between Maria and Josie.  It's an enjoyable Lesbian movie,1039219200,19,448,4.766233766233766
921444,5,6304676107,"Sherry from Outlook Press has already hit the high points of plot and characters (see her thorough, capable review here on this site), so I will spare a rehash and instead talk about themes.
What I liked best about this movie was the sense of history that the characters had with one another. They've been friends a long time, and they display toward one another that sometimes cautious balance and sometimes reckless running-off-at-the-mouth that good friends so often do. None of them want to hurt the others, and yet with so much history, sometimes even the most innocuous observation can cut to the quick. At the same time, it is just those sorts of observations or comments that are the impetus for the small changes the characters make in this one weekend they spend together.
So often, lesbians have had to create their own Chosen Family in the face of pressure and lack of acceptance from birth families. This is an issue for some of these characters. They do find respite with one another, as well as tension and misunderstanding. But the theme of learning and growing by interaction with others runs strong in this story. For anyone who has ever wished for a ""Big Chill"" type of group to hang around, this movie is a chance to live vicariously. These are seven women who, if they really existed, I would enjoy knowing.
Finally, like so many movies with lesbian themes, this one has been shorted in the area of production values. Despite a bit of choppiness and the sound being tinny in a few spots, the acting is good, the plot flows well, and in less than 100 minutes, viewers will find themselves caring about these characters and what happens to them.
Twenty years from now (when I hope lesbian films are well-financed and plentiful!), we'll look back at this movie as an early pioneer. I have owned it since it was released on VHS in 1997, and it holds up well under repeat viewings. I have very much enjoyed introducing others to it who have not seen it, and I would highly recommend it as warm, funny, and wonderful.",1018569600,17,2032,4.631578947368421
921445,5,6304676107,"Films targeted for lesbian audiences are seldom able to meet more mainstream standards, but Everything Relative is a well-written, provocative story of seven women coming together for a weekend to celebrate the birth of a child. One can't put this much chemistry together in one place, though, and not expect some amazing things to happen.
Friends in college, all have a shared history, at least in part, much of which is unresolved. An old relationship must be confronted when Josie and Maria become painfully aware of a conversation they should have had many years ago, and they must now find a way to put misunderstandings to rest. We watch as they struggle with a past neither of them could control, and question what the future might hold if they could somehow reach out to each other.
Victoria and Katie, mothers of the child bringing the group together, deal with relationship issues brought on by external pressures including a child, financial inequality, and career vs. family pride. When Victoria drops her lover's hand as a colleague approaches them in public, a debate begins within the group that covers very real issues facing all lesbians in today's society. How much is our pride worth, and how much power is actually lost by letting the Far Right draw their own conclusions?
All will be intrigued by Luce, the sexual dynamo with rock-hard abs and a sexy voice to boot, who must come to terms with herself and her past, and with the ghost she harbors in both places. Luce is partly what we all want in a lover and partly what we all want to be -- serious yet wild, desired yet strong, beautiful yet vulnerable. But if Luce is ever to break the endless stream of casual affairs she seems both able to start and end with a fair amount of apathy she must let go of Sonja, the perfect lover, who died many years ago, and who keeps Luce's heart from taking chances and losing the game.
Gena could be the one to bring Luce back among the living. With her sarcastic wit and movie-star looks, she is the songstress who sings life back into the hallowed place reserved for Sonja, and brings a less serious pace to the film. She looks like fluff but, in the end, it is Gena who reveals more of life's truths than we deemed her capable.
""Everything Relative"" features outstanding performances by the entire cast, and addresses many lesbian issues while providing great storylines and interesting characters. Those looking for racy love scenes will not be disappointed, as the film is not to be outdone in this area either. This group can heat up a Northampton night better than most, without compromising the integrity of the film or our expectations of the characters. They play, laugh, and love the way we would if we were them, and in a way that truly depicts many lesbian lifestyles.

921446,5,6304676107,"Everything Relative is the best lesbian movie I have seen to date.  The acting is poor in the beginning but as the story develops, the acting gets better and the story pulls you in.  The main thing to say about this movie is, it has a STORY.  It's not just about sex.  I recommend this movie to any lesbian!",1003968000,10,307,4.1525423728813555
921447,3,6304676107,"I saw this film once.  I bought it quite some time ago and have only watched it once.  I would recommend renting it instead of buying it.  The plot was somewhat interesting and the movie had it's moments, but overall it was just-""OK"".  The end of the movie is when it gets a bit better and there are intimate scenes between the characters.  Borrow it from a friend or rent it.  It is worth seeing once, but not worth owning.",985910400,6,424,4.2375
921448,2,6304676107,"A good film about friendships and bonds, not such a great film about love. The movie seemed to have played right into stereotypes, and perhaps it was meant to. However, with a little more work and a little more imagination  the idea this movie was based on could have seemed much more original. With  better acting, the same director, and a bit more true to life scenario,  this could have been a fantastic film. I reccomend watching it to see how  unlike real life it is, and to compare notes with your friends on how you  would alter it. Definetly a rental, not worth buying, unless you like  movies that will collect dust on your shelf, seeing it once is enough, but  I do reccomend a viewing.",947635200,,696,4.433070866141732
921449,4,6304676107,"Grant it, this movie cannot compare to such greats as ""Bound"" (Yeah right), but it does have a lot of good undertones. One character makes a comment when refering about anothers characters family troubles by  saying, ""We make our own families."" Some mentioned stereotypical  story telling, well as part of the gay community,we are a stereo type. I  may as well have been on a weekend trip with my close friends.

However, if you're looking for a movie to cuddle up and watch on a Friday night when you have nothing better to do, this is the one.

7876913,4,6304676107,"Id heard this movie was like a gay big chill. I can understand the comparison but to me it wasn't.  Yes, it's about a group of women who have gotten back together after a long time to reunite for one who's had a baby and the little mans getting circumcised whereas in the big chill it was for a wake of a friend.  Both films were about college friends and in both films someone has died and one particular character is having a hard time getting over them.  There is music and there was music in the big chill. They break into dance from time to time just like in the Big Chill. BUT the music isn't great like it was in the big chill and the acting leaves something to be desired. The movie proves a lot of good points. In all i really liked the film. Is it my favorite? No.  Do I love it in comparison to the Big Chill? No. I'm happy to have it in my lgbt film collection though.  I bet it will be better the second time around.  I wasn't a big fan of the character Maria.  She was a woman in the mid thirties yet she still had the emotional and mental state (the scene where one of the women is trying to get her to admit she was in love and he had the side pony tail and she was swishing around making pouty noises I kinda wanted to barf.  She's kind of a flake) of a fifteen year old to me.  Other than her I found the characters rich and relatable.

Not bar hopping and bed hopping but living monogomous perhaps dull, to some, lives. If i was to be asked how i would like to be portrayed as a Lesbian the charactoers of this movie would do fine. The soundtrack is good, the acting is great, the story line has been thought out and works and it covers an array of topics of which i can relate to and im sure others could also.

7876916,4,6304676107,"Those who wrote rave reviews for this movie are spot on. It's a lesbian

gem designed for everyone. It's a classic story of old friends reuniting,

only this time with an incredibly provocative lesbian/queer storyline. It

covers a lot of important, serious topics, but it does so with incredible

finesse and with some fabulous entertainment. I mean, come on -- a reunion

of a bunch of college friends? Especially queer friends? Sound familiar?

Then join the party.....and the drama!

Victoria and Katie are having a baby, and their four closest friends

return to their old 'hood (and even their old house!) to join in the

celebration. None of them are prepared for what surfaces -- sexual

tension/relationship ghosts of the past, political debate (the politics of

being out, being queer), relationship dynamics (class differences, raising

children), the way everyone has changed (and hasn't), and dealing with it

all in front of their old close friends. We've all been there, to some

degree, so we can all relate. Each character brings their own dynamic

--from Luce, the heartbreaking party-animal, to the gorgeous, sassy Gena,

to the duo (Josie and Maria) who finally deal with their old drama. If

you've ever had a close-knit group of friends, all with unique

personalities, then you will love this movie. It's that simple.

Everything Relative is one of those movies for any mood. It's

entertaining, yet serious. It's very queer, yet really pertains to any

group of old friends. The cast is great, the characters dynamic and

appealing, and the storyline believable. It's good.",1136505600,,1597,5.084942084942085

It falls into the same trap as many other lesbian films (I'm thinking specifically of Go Fish here), focusing more on political commentary than an actual story. The script makes every single mistake that's normally corrected by your very first screenwriting teacher. Everything feels forced. Backstory is conveyed in the most obvious of methods. The acting is just plain god-awful. I think I only watched the whole thing because I was hoping there would be something at the end like, ""Hey, we were just kidding! Didn't this movie suck? Gotcha!"" No such luck. If you like to slow down on the freeway to see the blood and guts of a car accident, this movie might just be right up your alley.
