7947072,3,B00005NG6F,"The title alone seems very idiosyncratic.  This is a film that would probably only be of interest to those that have lived in Colombia, and especially for those that have had any connection to this corrupted musical environment.  Seems like everything in Colombia has been corrupted at one point or another.",1422489600,,307,5.0
7947073,5,B00005NG6F,"This movie introduced me to cumbia and vallenato music. It blew my mind and changed my life. The music on here is nothing short of awesome, the most raw accordion music I ever heard. Check it out!",1416787200,,196,4.324324324324325
7947074,4,B00005NG6F,"Fun and fascinating documentary piece. Currently living in Costa del Norte. The film touches on cultural history of the area, showcases many of the classic vallenato numbers. While viewing the DVD some of my friends actually joined in on these well known songs. The one objection I must raise is the translator voice-over dubs. This is a flaw that prevents me from screening this informative documentary to an academic audience.  Excellent and enjoyable introduction to the fascinating common culture of Colombia.",1286236800,,513,5.333333333333333
7947075,3,B00005NG6F,"My maine objection for the otherwise great documentary is that the director focuses only in the relationship between shotguns, namely criminal activities, and that especific colombian regional music.",1241827200,,199,6.142857142857143
7947076,4,B00005NG6F,"""Shotguns and Accordions - Music of the Marijuana Growing Regions of Colombia"" is an engaging watch. While the title suggests that this is a film about music, the scope is broader.  In the film, music is seen as a barometer of sorts to show changes in Columbian society.  Much of the emphasis is on the socio-economic changes that have come about as a result of the drug trade with the United States. The director's primary narrative vehicle is the interview. Along the way, the audience visits a diverse sampling of the country including the hinterlands, coast, cities and small towns along the way. The visit to an indigenous Indian village is especially rewarding. The viewer is taken to several music festivals. As a whole, the music is very good and interesting. Incubated in a uniquely Columbian way, most of the music is an acoustic blending of Spanish, Indian and African influences. For those with an appreciation of ethnomusicology, the time period is fascinating. Filmed in the early 1980's, it shows a transitional time for Columbian music. While most of the music would still be considered folkl&oacute;rico, it shows the introduction of electric instruments and more global elements. One of the highlights features a club band. While playing a jam with an R&B groove, the band leader is hoisted upon his band mate's shoulders. There, he plays a spirited accordion solo with his foot as if he were a Latino Jimi Hendrix. Simultaneously, he manages to get out a few Little Richard style call and responses. What's the chorus? ""People Envy Me Because I Have Two Women."" While the video and audio is good, it should have been remastered for the DVD transfer. ""Shotguns and Accordions"" will appeal to those with an interest in the global drug trade and viewers with an affection for South American music.",1181433600,3,1813,4.921568627450981
7947077,3,B00005NG6F,"its not really about colombia and its music as a whole but more about a town under direct drug trade influence that looses its culture to guns,cars,greed and money.

all musical performances are basically played by the musicians of that town.

no mention of lucho bermudez,pastor lopez..anything

if u got $15 or so dollars to spare then fine",1180051200,,342,4.862068965517241
7947078,5,B00005NG6F,"This documentary made for Bitish television in the 1980s deals with the roots of the present political crisis in Colombia.  It is not, in the final analysis, a film ""about"" music.  Instead, it provides cultural and poltical contexts for understanding and enjoying Colombia cultural production of all types.  Still, the music (there is a lot!) is outstanding, the ""talking heads"", for once, actually have something worth hearing, and the images are searing and memorable, particularly during the last ten minutes or so.  Highly recommended.",1003104000,12,539,5.380952380952381
