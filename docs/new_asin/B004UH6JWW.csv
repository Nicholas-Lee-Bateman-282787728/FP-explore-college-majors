8441542,4,B004UH6JWW,"The story of England's progress through the 1990 World Cup is known to many and indelibly etched into the minds of its supporters. This DVD will be appreciated by both groups - as a captivating docu-drama that provides many insights into the team, it's players and ultimately the English nation's psyche. I was left feeling that this sad little nation, tearing itself up with social discord, could find unity once again through the struggles of this heroic team.",1404345600,,462,4.935897435897436

8441544,2,B004UH6JWW,"Judge Josh Rode, DVD Verdict-- It is quite fitting that One Night in Turin is about football (note to Americans: ""football"" in this context means ""soccer"") because the show is set up very much like a football match; there is a lot of build up and very little payoff. It is exactly like watching a match with several corners and crossing attempts that ends in a 0-0 draw.

For instance, the English team takes a break between early matches and everyone uses the break to relax except for Paul Gascoigne, or ""Gaz""; he has so much energy that he plays tennis with tourists for the entire day off. The narrator warns him to take it easy. There is little doubt in the viewer's mind that his reckless behavior is going to be a factor in the next match. Probably he'll be so worn out that he will run out of gas. But when the next match is shown, it makes no reference back to the tennis incident whatsoever, and no mention is made of Gaz being extra tired or inept or anything. The warning was a narrative red herring.

The same can be said for the match scenes. The film makes a big deal about Coach Bobby Robson switching to a new attack that creates space for the team's stars to do their collective thing, then shows shot after shot either missing the goal or getting caught by the goal keeper. A purported rigorous attack results in a 0-0 draw with Holland and 1-0 wins over their next two opponents.

This isn't really news. Football, hampered as it is by the ridiculous offside rule, is not a high-scoring game. The excitement it generates is similar to baseball; something might happen at any given moment, and for the true fans that anticipation is what keeps them hooked on the game. If this film had focused more on that aspect instead of making promises it couldn't keep, it would have been much more satisfying.

The film's thesis is that ""hooligans"" were a huge problem before 1990. Before we examine this thesis further, it should be explained that hooligans in this context are not flash mobs of irritated fans; they are actually organized groups that support a particular team and show their support by beating up the opposing teams' fans. One Night in Turin tries to make the case that the 1990 World Cup run resulted in a precipitous drop in this cultural phenomenon, but it never makes a real connection between the two. It points out that everyone was happy that England went further than expected, but there is no talk about repentant hooligans who decide they've been idiots too long.

Instead, the film bases its case on the historical fact that hooliganism dropped off fairly sharply around 1990. However, that timing also happens to coincide with the enacting of the Football Spectators Act, which was put into law in 1989. This act was created specifically to crack down on sports hooligans. Which is the more likely cause of the decrease in hooliganism?

The extras actually do a better job of supporting the film's thesis than the film itself. A short interview with Pete Davies, who authored All Played Out, the book that inspired the film, presents his passionate views on the subject. And the commentary track gives director James Erskine and editor Robin Peters a more linear mode to communicate what they're trying to say. The only other extra is a behind the scenes featurette that explains how they tried to recreate an Italian summer from Newcastle in February.

The 1.33:1 video is a mix of archival footage and set shots designed to tie everything together, and the video quality is equally as mixed. There is some grain and pixilation but for the most part the picture is acceptable. Some of the added shots meant to bring home the tension (actors pretending to be hooligans interspersed with real shots of mobs; actors' legs kicking balls during footage of matches) don't fare well next to the real thing. The 2.0 Dolby stereo sound mostly consists of Gary Oldman narrating, and he has a fine voice that carries nicely. Overall, the film is directed and edited quite well.
