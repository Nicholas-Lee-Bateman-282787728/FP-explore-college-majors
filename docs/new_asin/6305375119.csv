7889779,5,6305375119,"I've never seen the movie it's self,but I saw it on Kids WB once and really liked it!  Although Ash lost to Lt. surge at first later he figured out Lt. Surges Raichu never learned the evasive attacks(Agility and Double team)when it was still a Pikachu so Ash's Pikachu kept Dodging Raichu so Raichu eventually ran out of attacks and Ash's Pikachu quicky knocked it out!!!  One of the funniest things about this episode was Team Rocket was constantly cheering Ash's Pikachu on because they knew if it could beat it's evolved form,Raichu it would be worth stealing(not that they ever could steal it)!",1002067200,2,598,4.740384615384615
7889780,4,6305375119,"The episode ""Battle Aboard the St. Anne"" has really made me wonder about James ... I think he needs therapy.  Then again, he wouldn't be half as funny as he is if he were well-adjusted.
And of course, for you Pikachu fans, he and Raichu mix it up in ""Electric Shock Showdown"", the best episode on this DVD.  Lt. Surge isn't letting our little yellow guy win easily, but as usual Pika's brains (not Ash's) save the day.  (In this one, James and Jesse get weird again with their ""Pika cheer"".  Disturbing yet funny.  Maybe these two just didn't get enough love when they were children.)
The third episode, ""Mystery At the Lighthouse"", is eery and delightfully chilling.
This DVD belongs in every Poke fan's collection!",983664000,4,716,4.650793650793651
7889781,4,6305375119,I think the episode Mystery at the Lighthouse on the Thunder Shock video  is my favorite because Ash catches a Krabby. Also in that episode they meet a Pokemaniac named Bill and he's looking for a Pokemon called Dragonite. It  has amazing powers. It's very good and people will feel a little sad after  they watch it. I hope you'll watch it. .,956534400,,343,4.412698412698413
7889782,1,6305375119,"If you are getting this for a child,think about it. Kids will probably watch it 1-5 times. Save your money and buy someone Monty Python,Quest for the Holy Grail. It is a show that you can watch 100 times. It will get  there minds off of Pokemon. You have probably all ready spent a lot money  on pokemon stuff. And they barely play with it.",953683200,,340,4.2153846153846155
7889783,5,6305375119,Ifyou like jessie and james make them selfs fools then watch this movie. I think battle abord the st. anne was funny when James kept getting punched by Jessie and his mouth is flinging up and down.,929318400,,197,4.351351351351352
