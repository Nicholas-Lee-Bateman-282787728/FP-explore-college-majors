4185728,3,B003RJM95K,"Lee Broughton's review nothwithstanding (he is an excellent reviewer and I urge you to read his alternate take on this film) this is a pretty stupid Zatoichi knock off.  Tony Anthony, as a sort of bumbling insect of a character, is sort of interesting.  And the bad guy (not Ringo) is very good.  But the script and the treatment of women in the film is pretty reprehensible.  The plot points just don't hang.

Most surprising scene in the film is the massacre of the General's troups.  Even knowing this is a sour and violent western, I was taken aback by this scene.  Pilar, the female interest, is a cipher.  The Bad Gal has potential but not enough screen time.  Somewhere in this movie is a mean spirited comment about treating women as cattle-commodity in the old west,  but even this theme isn't fully pursued. (The film is sexist, but needs to be pushed to repugnance to get attention, I think.)  End result:  this is lame.

The print I saw (SPAGHETTI WEST collection) was WS and had some very good compositions, but the print wasn't good.  Night scenes were too contrasty, so it was hard to fully watch the film.  This title, a German release, apparently is an excellent print (according to Broughton) and might influence my negative attitude if I get a chance to see it.  Too expensive ! !

Ringo looks good in the film, carries himself pretty well, but the depiction of his love-sick Mex-cowboy, that he is 'saddled' to play, doesn't give him enough to do.  In short, as with many Spaghettis, the script should be 'the thing,' but it lacks coherence and complexity.  I heard about this film around the time it was made, and it did not make it into very wide release in this country.  I saw a hand-printed sign for a screening of it, sometime in the early seventies, at a store-front cinema in Manhattan.  I had to split for dinner and could not catch this big-screen showing.  Next day the film was gone.  Am grateful to have finally seen this film, but it was pretty much a waste of time.",1256688000,,2000,4.5251396648044695

4185733,5,B003RJM95K,"If you're a Beatle/Ringo fan you must see this at least once. If you like spaghetti westerns you'll enjoy this even if you not crazy about Ringo.  Tony Anthony is the ""Blindman"", a blind gunfighter who rarely misses, and then makes up for his misses by getting off another shot.  Ringo gets second billing although his part is more third billing worthy. He does play a convincing Mexican bandito (with a great Mexican/Liverpublian accent) who is surprisingly cruel and evil.  No lovable mop-top here. Here Ringo shows us that he can act and play other characters.",1357171200,,563,4.84375

4185735,3,B003RJM95K,I purchased this film after looking for films based upon the 1960-89 Zatoichi Film and T/V series.  This was a below average independent production with Ringo Starr as a bad guy using a funny Hispanic accent. I purchased it to complete my collection.  If you want to see it I recommend renting it via Nexflix et al.,1295395200,3,315,4.508771929824562
4185736,3,B003RJM95K,"Great that there is a copy of the movie available, sad that it is on a single layer DVD disc and the video quality is not that great. May be not worth the price, unless you are a FAN!!!",1294185600,2,185,3.769230769230769
4185737,4,B003RJM95K,"Disclaimer:  The version of the film that I saw is included in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gunslinger-Western-Collection/dp/B002GOAGP2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gunslinger Western Collection</a>&nbsp;- as such, I cannot comment on the quality of the item listed on this product page.  My review is concerned with the entertainment value of the film only.

I've often run into films that exceeded my expectations, especially when they were low to begin with, but seldom do I begin a movie as uninterested in the material as I was with 'Blindman', only to find my initial assumptions disproved AND find an entertaining film to boot.  Essentially, I was checking the box - this movie came included in a set a 10 Italian Westerns, and I felt obligated to at least give it a try.  My problem was that the brief description about a 'Blind gunslinger' sounded formulaic and predictable - and I'm sure it could have been in some hands.  I expected a character who, though blind, would still exhibit preternatural skills and abilities in a ridiculously excessive way for the film's sake - and while no good Italian western has ever been scared of being ridiculously excessive, this sounded too contrived.

Well, there certainly is some of that excessive-ness - along with a pretty darn smart horse to help the man along - but all in all, those elements are subdued.  Instead, we get a man who uses his wits and plain chutzpah to relentlessly follow a course of action.  Tony Anthony, as the Blindman (as well as scriptwriter), holds a contract with a Texas mining town to bring fifty mail order brides to the miners.  But his partner has double-crossed him and sold the women to a bandit in Mexico, and Anthony rides off to track them down.  Persistence is the key, and the bandit leader, Domingo, finds out just how devoted to a vision a blind man can be.

Perhaps it is the American involvement with the script via Anthony, or because the film comes from a later period in the genre, but there seems to be a different sensibility about this movie than other Italian westerns.  There is less of the fantastic, of the highly improbable (as opposed to just the improbable), and of the operatic melodrama that worked so well in Leone's, and others, films.  That isn't to say those elements are completely gone, but some of these later films were almost parodies of the genre, and 'Blindman' seems like a return to a more basic story.

But don't despair if the quirky moments of these films are your biggest draw - there's still plenty left.  There's just something bizarre to me in the scene where the fifty women, loaded up in carts for the trip to Texas, are waylaid by the bandits, and they all scatter barefoot and barely clothed across the desert sand as the bandits try and round them up like a herd of cattle.  Raf Baldassarre, as a general in the Mexican cavalry, provides the oddball and energetic supporting role that's common to the style of these films, and even though the bandit crew all look as though they might have played in Mungo Jerry's back-up band, everyone handles their acting chores well.  Even Ringo Starr's performance as the bandit leaders brother, Candy, although a relatively minor role, is quite good.  A solid four-star effort in the genre.

I wasn't able to determine very much about the release offered on this product page by AFA Entertainment.  It's listed at 83 minutes, which conforms to the version I saw in the 'Gunslinger' collection, though AFA describes the format as Full Screen, and what I watched was wide screen, at what looked to be 2.35:1.  Whatever the source was for my version, the transfer is just ok - watchable, but that's it.  I don't know for sure, but I would bet the source is the same for both releases.  Includes some brief nudity, but I also noticed one scene had a muted curse word, so at least in some fashion, the film I watched was edited.",1293926400,3,3946,4.837797619047619
