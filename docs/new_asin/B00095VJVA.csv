2267953,4,B00095VJVA,"i looked through a couple other pregnancy belly dance dvds before getting this one, and this one was the least, um, awkward. some had technical problems, like bad voice synching; in another, the movements were too advanced; in a third, the woman was barely dressed and looked like she was enjoying herself a little too much, if you catch my drift. sera solstice is very calm, and professional, and accessible--so don't let the urban primitive/goth costumes throw you off.

that being said, i think it was a little too easy, and didn't do really a great job of stretching/working out my hips and lower back. i would have liked more hip moves, to work out the pain and stiffness i have in those areas.",1353283200,,699,4.637096774193548
2267954,5,B00095VJVA,"Not JUST for pregnancy!

Seriously - don't pass this up just because you are not pregnant and don't plan to be.  Belly Dance is a thorough and gentle workout for the female body in ALL its stages and ages;  ""The Goddess Dance"" is THAT much more (pregnant or not).

For example, if you are recovering from illness or injury; feeling the passage of time on your muscles or joints (it happens!); reentering Belly Dance studies; or this is a day where your energy needs support not aerobic-high-impact demand; I can't recommend a better workout than this one.

The footwork is smooth and steady, weight shifts are slow, the shimmy speed is up to you and your body, and the time spent on muscle identification and control (body waves and Keegles) strengthens essential muscles.  *wink*

Some of the reviews give the impression that this isn't a safe workout for beginners.  I am no longer a beginner (13+ years) so maybe I have forgotten; but I can offer this:

1)  Keep in mind, when she explains that Ribcage Rotations and Chest Circles are fairly advanced and deep moves that require time - she means it!  If you have never done those moves, don't try to make them as big as demonstrated.  Listen to her, ""Let them be small.""  ""Give yourself time.""

2) When she tells you to point your tailbone down - there is a reason.  Pointing your tailbone down causes an ""echo"" of muscle contraction in the abdominal wall and obliques - this equals support.  Always be mindful of and protect your back muscles (they are very long and vulnerable) whether it be during Belly Dance or your everyday movements.

I wish I had this 20+ years ago with my pregnancies and deliveries.",1334275200,3,1662,4.636986301369863
2267955,5,B00095VJVA,"As much as I tend to hate anything with ""goddess"" in the title, especially with combined with ""pregnancy"" or ""bellydance,"" I love this video and by the end of it, have a bit of a girl-crush on Sera Solstice. This is the first prenatal bellydance program that leads you through what feels like real dancing. Moreover, the aesthetics of it are simply delightful.

I'm going to review this from two perspectives -- as a prenatal workout and as a dance instructional. The video also has two meditation segments, but I'm not quite into that right now.

As prenatal workout:

Sera is eight months pregnant during the filming of the video, and she explains that she has chosen movements based on what she has found satisfying for her pregnant body. She doesn't mention consulting any medical literature on safe movements for pregnancy, but nothing she does contradicts any indications I've seen. Her backup dancers demonstrate the moves for early pregnancy and postnatal, but there really isn't too much difference in most sequences.

The beginning warmup is dancey, smooth, but quite minimal -- I suggest complementing with your own basic movements like cat stretches, leg stretches, and neck and shoulder rolls. The dance combos themselves are great for a woman who's growing. Yes, they push a little further than the very basic movements of other prenatal workouts, but it ultimately feels very good. Although Sera often talks about the need to lower awareness to the hips and pelvis, I think the real strength of this program is in what it does for the upper body. I'm in my sixth month of pregnancy, and I end every day feeling pain in my upper back and rib area. While my yoga videos do provide good side stretches, there really is nothing like bellydance to stretch upper abdominals, upper back muscles, and obliques.

The workout as a whole is not heavy on the cardio, but you will feel it, especially if you have been doing lighter, pregnancy-type exercise. I added a necessary cool-down and stretch on my own.

As dance workout:

I loved the video as a dance workout. I don't think it would be the right thing for someone trying bellydance for the very first time. Although Sera does give quite lengthy explanations of the movements, using good visuals, you have to pick them up pretty quickly to be able to move along with the video. It takes most women a bit of time to learn a flat-footed maya or an omi or even a chest circle. However, if you have some experience of the moves, her instruction is great for improving your execution of them. The combinations are manageable, but not boring, especially if you also think about getting the hands and arms right.

Most importantly, Sera is a really beautiful dancer. I tend not to get as excited about tribal fusion, since it often seems to lack the fluidity and grace I love about more traditional bellydance forms. Sera is the person to prove me wrong. Her movements are an education in grace, and it's saying a lot that following her makes you feel like you are dancing.",1323216000,4,3026,4.739543726235741
2267956,3,B00095VJVA,"For those with belly dancing experience, this video will likely work great.  I fit in that category, though I'm rather out of shape and practice.  It is a gentle workout, but it will still get your blood flowing if you've sat through your first trimester due to feeling terrible like I have.  I feel like that's a plus.

However, I'm a little concerned that there's not more attention paid at the beginning to the posture.  Sera does mention occasionally to turn your tailbone towards the ground, but that's as much as I noticed.  Posture is very, very important in belly dancing.  Doing things in the incorrect posture could possibly pinch your sciatic nerve, which a pregnant woman is already at risk of doing.  So I'm a little worried for those who are just picking up this form of dance harming themselves due to lack of instruction on how to properly stand, which should be the FIRST THING explained in any class or video.  And then it should be brought up over and over again to the point of being nearly obnoxious for the safety of the beginning, the experienced, and everyone in between as you go through each move.

Even with experience, I would have liked the moves to be broken down just a little more.  I genuinely enjoy picking up on how each teacher executes a move as I, personally, am very serious about constantly improving my own form.",1320105600,4,1353,4.595833333333333
2267957,5,B00095VJVA,"This work out is very well broken down. There are three dancers.  One is for Early pregnancy, another for postpartum, and Sera preforms movements for the second and third trimester.  The movements of all three are about the same.  The dances are very gentle and beautiful.  I don't feel so tired at the end of the exercise that I cannot continue doing things the rest of the day.  I'm in my 23rd week of pregnancy.  I've had a sore stiff back for the past few weeks and this DVD has helped with the pain and stiffness.  I will definitely be using this the rest of my pregnancy.",1309824000,,577,4.336448598130841
2267958,5,B00095VJVA,"Okay I do not believe this DVD is exactly geared at technique, so if your pregnant and you happen to belly dance this will not break down all the moves.  For instance Sera goes over chest slides but doesn't really break them down, she breaks down the important moves that would actually effect your baby.  Such as hip movements, she goes into detail over hip drops what what you should do depending on how far along you are.  There is a good introduction where Sera talks about how far along she is and what belly dance has brought to her as well as what the DVD will be over.  There is a great 20 minute warm up that gets you moving but not too much.  This is a really gentle DVD.  Then she does two combos, they are each about 15 minutes or so, but fun to do and memorable.  There is a performance section and then Sera does a labor meditation section.  I personally didn't enjoy the meditation section but so rather than say anything negatively about it, I'll leave it up to you if you like it or not.  I get calmed and find my center with quieting my mind with Yoga.

I'm currently 13 weeks pregnant and wanted to keep belly dancing but wanted something a little gentle and fun to do between classes.  I like that the DVD is short and sweet so I can practice before I go to bed or before work or before my husband gets up on the weekend.  If you are looking for a gentle belly dance DVD and/ or you are pregnant and interested in trying belly dance this DVD is fun and great!  I really enjoy it and look forward to sharing this practice with my baby.",1306281600,5,1554,4.174496644295302
8057527,5,B00095VJVA,"The Perfect Pregnancy Workout Bellydance: (two stars)  This DVD was $25, and was by far my least favorite workout.  The moves are so simple and basic that I found it boring, and only did it a couple of times.  The workouts are both half an hour and are virtually identical, with only a few very minor changes.  Had there been a totally different workout for the ""level two"" I definitely would have given a better rating.  As it stands, I think throwing in that second workout was misleading, because it's pretty much the same thing.  The higher cost put my expectations higher, and the dvd simply did not deliver.
I used to work out regularly, but haven't since my first pregnancy (I didn't exercise at all then, because I was sick the whole pregnancy), and my daughter's birth.  We walk a lot, but that's pretty much been it (she is a little over two years old), so I am not some fitness guru or dance expert.  I only recommend this if your fitness level is zero, and you are already over six months pregnant before you decide to try a Prenatal workout.  If by the end of my pregnancy (I'm a little less than six months now) this is the only workout I can handle, I'll come back and up the rating.

Bellydance Prenatal Fitness with Naia: (four stars)  if all you are looking for is a quick thirty minute workout, this is a good pick.  The movements keep rolling along, and nothing is super complex, but there are great strengthening moves in here that will certainly help tone all the right muscles for labor and delivery.  There's not a ton of talking or any filler either; this DVD is a flat thirty minutes of focused exercising.  The segments get combined into a sort of choreographed dance, but some of the moves aren't all that ""dancey"" to me compared to other DVDs that I have.  Still, all in all I like this DVD, and choose it on days when I'm not up for a longer Prenatal workout.  It goes by quickly, and I don't get bored.
If you get impatient when you can't follow along with a workout immediately, skip this one.  She doesn't take a lot of time doing the moves super slowly.  Unless you are an experienced dancer, or have done tons of bellydancing, it will take you some practice to get parts of this workout down perfectly.  I'm still a tad clumsy at certain parts of it, but I could care less.  I keep it moving regardless of the ""quality"" of my dancing ability, and manage to enjoy myself.  Watch it once before trying it, and slow down parts that seem confusing.  You CAN get it over time.
The only thing I don't care for about this dvd is the bizarre counting.  She does an eight count, and her tone is odd and distracting.

Amira's Bellydance and Yoga for Pregnancy: (four stars)  Ok, overall Amira put together a very thoughtful and effective Prenatal workout, however, over time a few things about this DVD grated on my nerves.  Maybe it's because I am six months pregnant now?  There are little snippets about the history of bellydancing and childbirth mixed in with the workout.  While these are interesting to watch a couple of times, it then becomes a minor irritation having to skip over them every time you want to work out.  I want to stay in my workout zone without being interrupted, and I felt all the history/ trivia snippets should have been combined into one segment that was completely separate from the workout.
Another thing that bugged me is that the cool down comes after a ""Labor Exercises"" segment that cannot be done by women 32 weeks and after.  It would have made more sense to put the cool down before this part, so that women 32 weeks and on don't have more to skip over.
Apart from that, I thought the workout was very well done, and incorporated many traditional belly dance moves (hips circles, rib slides, bicycle hips, infinity circles, etc.)  The whole workout is about eighty minutes long total, but is easy to break down if you don't have that much time.

Goddess Dance Prenatal Bellydance with Sera Solstice: (five stars, in spite of a few minor issues) This is the longest Prenatal workout that I have done, but I love the thoughtful extras like the standing and seated meditation segments.  Sera Solstice is a good teacher, easy to follow, and good at breaking down the moves.  This entire workout moves at a slow and soothing pace, and teaches you two different dance combos that are then combined at the end in a nice performance dance.
There is a six minute warm up, and then the first combo is 22 minutes, and the second combo is 31 minutes.  The two combos are combined afterwards in a six minute dance segment.  If you don't have time for both segments, do the warm up with combo one on some days, and then the warm up with combo two on others.  It's a great way of breaking down the dvd into multiple workouts, and your body will thank you.
After the dance portion of the workout there is a slow standing sort of dancy meditation to help you connect with your baby and body, and following that is a seated moving meditation section.  These are very relaxing, and definitely put me in a calm place.  Both of these sections combined take about 22 minutes.  I like to save them for right before bed time to help me sleep.
In total, I think if you go through and do the whole DVD it's roughy an hour and a half.
My only small complaint is that some of the moves are done for way too long.  The repetition of certain movements got to be dull to me, and I'd get impatient for the next one to come.  Not a huge deal, just an observation.
I will definitely recommend this teacher to other women though.

Other Bellydance DVDs that aren't specifically prenatal, but I am enjoying them while pregnant:

(Note: vigorous hip shimmies and fast turns aren't recommended at 28 weeks and after.  SLOW it down, and be mindful)

Foundations of Belly Dance with Sera Solstice: I can still do most of this at six months pregnant, and I love the combinations.  I slow down the sections with shimmies (chapter five and chapter six which take up about 17 minutes total), or sometimes just do my own thing while they play.  Eighty minutes total.  This has my all time favorite warm up and moving meditation with stretches (that part alone is 30 minutes, and I'm loving it while pregnant)

Bellydance East Coast Tribal with Sera Solstice: What can I say, I'm a fan of her teaching.  I did this workout for the first time today, and had no problems with any of the movements. (Not that I can do them all well, mind you...) the Twenty minute warmup is great, and then ten minutes of drills, all totally doable during pregnancy.  Following that is a seven minute dance routine that is fairly slow paced, and I still have no issues with it even with my giant baby belly.  For some reason the entire dance segment comes before the instruction of each combo instead of after, and that's weird, but it's a good workout.  Don't worry, she DOES show you how to do all the stuff in the dance routine.

Luscious, Sensual Goddess, and Love Potion Bellydance Workout with Neon (three separate DVDs):  These may be a bit harder for some to follow, but I still consider myself a beginner, and I'm enjoying these workouts while pregnant just to keep some variety.  Love Potion is the most difficult one for me to follow, because I'm not spectacular at footwork, but I still pop it in and give it my all.  Luscious is my favorite of the three, but I enjoy the other two as well.

This has to be the longest review I have ever written, but I started bellydancing at fourteen weeks of my pregnancy, and it has been so empowering for me!!!  I'm working out four times a week (along with plenty of walking), and feel like I'm in better shape than I was right before I got pregnant.
 I highly recommend trying these DVDs for yourself!!!!!

(I'm happy to answer any questions about these DVDs if you have any)",1490918400,2,7825,4.463757916959888
8057528,5,B00095VJVA,I love the meditation section at the end. I am 8 months pregnant and the workout truly is perfect for me. I can only do about 15-30 minutes at a time because of other complications but it gets me moving. I would recommend it to anyone pregnant. I am looking forward to being able to do the whole thing post-natal.,1475798400,,313,4.233333333333333
8057529,5,B00095VJVA,"I love it, but I already am a bellydancer so it makes it easier. I can see that it would be frustrating to people that have never tried bellydance before. Just keep practicing and you'll get it! I have been enjoying the meditation 1 and 2 as I have been preparing for my pregnancy. I find it very relaxing which is what women need during that two week wait. Sera is a great dancer to follow along with. The moves are gentle for mom and baby and actually helped alleviate cramps when meditating. You don't need to do all of the DVD in one session.",1431734400,,546,4.20952380952381
8057530,4,B00095VJVA,"This is a very slow, gentle work out. If I wasn't pregnant, I would be bored with it, but as I expand, I'm more and more appreciative of the pace.  Sera uses her own experiences as a mother and a dancer to choose the moves and combinations that she felt helped her the most.  She doesn't try to motivate you beyond what your body can do, but she does motivate you to keep going - she says at one point ""the move may be so small you can barely even see it, and that's ok.""

Its been difficult for me to balance pregnancy, fitness, and self-esteem, but this DVD really does help.",1425254400,,577,4.133928571428571
8057531,5,B00095VJVA,I LOVED practicing with this DVD during my pregnancy! I have been belly dancing for about 7-8 years and it really helped during my pregnancy and delivery. Sera offers a beautiful prenatal practice and the visualizations at the end of the DVD are so AMAZING! If I was too tired I would sometimes just play the meditation/visualization to connect with body and baby! A really great DVD!,1421971200,,384,4.746268656716418
8057532,3,B00095VJVA,"I like Sera and she is serious and passionate about prenatal belly dance. I give three stars because she talks a bit, and I find distracting from the dance and slows the pacing, though we are moving the whole time. This is not for beginners. With that being said, I am one, and with a bit of humor, time, and pacing, I was able to follow the dances. I enjoyed the meditations--very affirming. Wish I could make it into audio to just listen to.",1412208000,,443,4.285714285714286
8057533,4,B00095VJVA,"Of the three prenatal bellydance DVDs I've tried, this one comes the closest to the feeling of strength and sensuality I've enjoyed for years doing bellydance at home. Sera is a beautiful dancer, and I like that she narrates her movements as she goes, as opposed to having a voice-over. Some comments here say she breaks movements down too much, some say too little, some say it's not enough workout, some say too much.. it makes me think of that saying, ""The art of compromise is that everyone leaves feeling just a little dissatisfied!"" The movements are generally quite small, and repeated LOADS of times. She does a very good job explaining which muscles you should be using throughout the entire movement, which allows you to decide just how much effort to put into each one. If you really concentrate on SQUEEZING those muscles throughout each movement, you're definitely going to feel it! If you kind of just go through the motions, then no, you won't get much workout here. This is certainly not a cardiovascular workout! But, if  you're looking for something to make you feel sexy and graceful while helping tone the muscles in your hips, pelvic floor, abs and back, give this one a try! I do wish there were more stretching at the end instead of one of the two meditation sections.",1383782400,,1291,4.712389380530974
8057534,5,B00095VJVA,"I did this to get toned towards the end of my pregnancy, and find myself practicing in the shower and while cleaning still (my LO is 3 months). My dr said I did amazing in labor, and I think the belly dancing helped a lot! I did it during contractions for awhile too.",1368576000,,267,4.056603773584905
8057535,4,B00095VJVA,"I bought this dvd largely because I couldn't sleep.  Four to five months into my second pregnancy, and all my joints and muscles were totally locked up, with serious pain in my left hip socket.  Having done some belly dance off and on since college, I knew that of all the exercises I could pick, belly dance would be the one that would loosen my locked-up body and let me feel good again.  I looked at some of the other prenatal belly dance options, including trying out ""Amira's Belly Dance for Pregnancy"" through Netflix, but I chose this one because of its obvious focus on describing technique.  I'm not a very experienced belly dancer, but I know enough to realize that the movements are so internally based, that it is almost impossible to just watch and copy.

Sera Solstice does an amazing job of breaking down each individual movement into its parts and describing them clearly.  I am nowhere near as graceful as the ladies on the video, however, her descriptions are so clear, I can close my eyes and focus on allowing my body to follow her directions, almost letting it feel its way through the space.  I can feel my body unkinking as I go through the movements--the knots in my body actually pop loose as I move, sometimes giving me an extra inch or two of reach out of nowhere.  Since starting to do this video regularly (I aim for every other day, but sometimes it's only twice a week) I sleep a million times better.  I actually sleep through night most nights!  While I do other prenatal exercise videos as well, including the excellent 10 Min Solutions Prenatal Pilates and Leisa Hart's FitMama Prenatal workout, this is the one I turn to when my body feels tight, painful and uncomfortable.  It's gentle, effective, and it works better than Advil for getting rid of those joint pains and muscle spasms.

Even though I'm not that into the included meditations (it's just not my style), I highly recommend this video for other expecting moms, even if they've never done belly dance before.  The dance instruction section lasts over an hour, but though the exercise is drawn out and sometimes repetitive (which is actually a really good thing for toning and understanding the movement) it is never strenuous.  That said, most of the movements require you to be somewhat squatting/standing on bent legs, so your thigh muscles might protest the first few times through the workout.  Just take it at your own pace and rest when you need to.  On the plus side, I have noticed significant improvement in my leg strength and endurance, which I'm really excited about.  I know it will really benefit me come delivery-time when I'm trying to stay in birth-friendly positions.  This video keeps your muscles and joints flexible and feeling good even as your belly gets bigger.",1360454400,,2783,4.714876033057851
8057536,3,B00095VJVA,"I really liked Sera, and the movements and dancing are beautiful, but this is not going to work as a work out video for me. First, it is too long, definately over an hour long. Second, there are chapters in the DVD, but it wasn't set up like separate workouts. Once you press play on the DVD, all the chapters just play in succession, so it would not be easy to break up the work out into smaller time chunks without feeling like I was stopping in the middle. Lastly, it seemed more like an instructional/educational video than an exercise video. There were a lot of very small movements and repeating of movements during the explanations. Again, it is not that I didn't like her or how she was teaching, it was just that the program as a whole was too long that it would be impracticle for me to try to incorporate it into my work-out routine. I think this DVD would be great for someone who has larger chunks of time and really wants to learn belly dancing.",1359763200,4,959,4.333333333333333
