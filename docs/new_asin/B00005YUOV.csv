7957331,5,B00005YUOV,History has always been a distinct favorite of mine. I thought I knew about WW1 and the events that led up to its outbreak but was I wrong. This 3 volume set is outstsnding viewing and should be required as a prime supplement for teaching about this subject in schools and even in colleges. Those who ignore history of any kind and particularly world wars are bound to repeat it !!,1358121600,,381,4.380281690140845
7957332,5,B00005YUOV,"This DVD collection, which includes all six volumes of the original VHS release from MPI Media Group, includes a comprehensive selection of British-source news reels and other material. The producer obviously knows his military history and it shows in the diversity of subject matter: everything from World War One veterans suffering from ""shell shock"", to rare footage (at least to US audiences) of French military operations in Vietnam.

 As I mentioned in my other review on ""Archives of War,"" this material is not interpreted via narration and is not a conventional documentary. Rather, it provides teachers and students alike an excellent opportunity to interpret original news reel coverage of warfare in the 20th century. So if you're looking for a program that offers heavy interpretation, then look elsewhere. However, ""Archives of War"" is valuable as a rich visual supplement for anyone with an interest in military history.",1170633600,6,934,5.346938775510204
