8013442,4,B0001JXHGY,"The video has the following matches from the 1999 Attitude Era:

Most Memorable Matches of 1999
02/14/99 Steve Austin vs. Vince McMahon (steel cage match -St. Valentine's Day Massacre)
01/24/99 The Rock vs. Mankind (""I quit"" match at the Royal Rumble)
10/17/99 Matt & Jeff Hardy vs. Edge & Christian (ladder match)
08/22/99 Shane McMahon vs. Test (Love her or leave her match)
07/25/99 Road Dogg & X-Pac vs. Billy Gunn & Chyna (Rights to DX name match)

I would've preferred that it be DVD but now that they have combined DVD/VHS players it's not so much of a hastle to watch. A great buy for any Attitude Era fan, but I only give it 4 stars due to the fact that it could've been longer with a little more storyline review added to beef up the matches.",1299456000,2,752,4.442028985507246
