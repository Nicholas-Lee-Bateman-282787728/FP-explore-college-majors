Decided to give it a try and have been pleasantly surprised at the heart-warming stories.  All the characters are believable and there is a good mixture of drama, humor and pathos.  Good life lessons as well.",1342828800,13,314,4.777777777777778
4892114,5,B005TN1SE0,"TV series of the Classic Bing Crosby film. This time Gene Kelly plays Father OMalley and Leo G (Topper)Carroll plays the Barry Fitzgerald part as Father Fitzgibbon. Dick York is Tom Colwell who runs the local club for kids.
Always a Great story with guest stars Galore,Ralph Meeker,Richard Carlson,William Demarest,Ed Begley,Frank Albertson,Henry Morgan,Ann Francis,George Kennedy,Eddie Bracken,Dan Duryea,etc to name but a few.
Gene is  Great as ever. Leo G Carroll as well as sometimes bungling,but still loveable Father Fitzgibbon.
This is a Great Series.
My personal favorite episode was Like My Own Brother. Eddie Bracken and Harry Morgan are two brothers who dislike each other. Even Father OMally and Father Fitz cant do much to change things. The well meaning priests try to bring them together to patch things up,but can do little about it. There is a solution,watch it and find out.",1332547200,10,892,5.2377622377622375
4892115,4,B005TN1SE0,"When I saw that this series from the early 1960's had been issued as a DVD set, I immediately ordered it.  I really didn't remember much about it, but I'm a big fan of Gene Kelly, who never fails to disappoint.  In this series, he brings his usual charm and easygoing personality to the role of Father O'Malley (the role Bing Crosby had made his own in the original film version).  Leo G. Carroll is a surprise as the elderly pastor, Father Fitzgibbon.  Who knew that he could take on an Irish brogue, dance a jig, and sing a delightful Irish tune?  I didn't remember Dick York at all from the series when it was first on TV, but he is believable in the role of the youth center director (a role not in the film).  I love this series for portraying a simpler time in a manner that just lets one sit back, relax, and enjoy.  It's gentle and loving.  How different from today's TV fare!",1330214400,25,884,4.251497005988024
4892116,4,B005TN1SE0,Love adding this particular series to my video collection -rare series that's not likely to come one's way anytime in the near future. Continues the adventures of Father O'Malley & Father/monsignor Fitzgibbons.,1326585600,9,210,5.59375

4892118,3,B005TN1SE0,"I'd never heard of the series until recently, and only stumbled across it after we recently enjoyed watching the film starring Bing Crosby. The cast is dynamite, and they are too good to fail at bringing life to the stories. But as much as I like Gene Kelly, he fails to invoke the unerring wisdom and gentle competence in the role that we enjoyed in the film. But it was a hard act to follow ... Crosby won a Best Actor Oscar for doing just what I described.

These stories are slowly paced but good hearted and with depth, just not as much depth as I had hoped for. Still, with a TV series of the early 60s, it is probably as much as one could hope for.

Sadly, the quality of the media has suffered. The image is dark and grainy. The sound is distorted and muddy to the point that at times I had trouble following the dialogue. I've seen TV reproductions from years earlier than this that are in pristine condition, so it's a shame that this unique series has suffered so from the ravages of time.

I'll give the quality of the show a 4, but the quality of the media a 2, and average it out to a 3. This is the very rare TV role for Gene Kelly, so I can't recommend against getting this. Any dedicated Gene Kelly fan will probably find something positive here, even if he doesn't dance much. LOL I know I did.

I'm not sorry to have made the purchase, but I am disappointed in the quality of the DVD presentation.",1393545600,19,1416,4.194852941176471

4892123,5,B005TN1SE0,I never forgot this series from 1962-63. So glad it's finally available after many years of waiting. The episodes are so heartwarming and some will make you cry. And they all teach a moral lesson in a non-preachy way.,1369440000,4,217,4.589743589743589
4892124,3,B005TN1SE0,Gene Kelly..Leo G. Carroll..Dick York...partly drama with comical situations here and there...I believe this was Gene Kelly's only attempt at a Tv series...may be not but can't remember anything else he was in series wise?,1368489600,,222,5.371428571428571
4892125,2,B005TN1SE0,"When I was a child, I watched GOING MY WAY every week. All that I remembered was that Gene Kelly starred as Father O'Malley and that Leo G. Carroll was Father Fitzgibbons. When I heard about the series on DVD, I decided to purchase it. For those who think Gene Kelly can do no wrong need to take a look at this curiosity. While there may be about six good episodes, the rest are very judgmental and even offensive.
The Leo G. Carroll character is the most offensive. He judges everyone and then turns around and contradicts himself. He is the reason that some Catholics may have steered away from this series (The ratings were low. The series only lasted one season.) If I were to be interested in becoming a Cathoic today and watched this series, I would choose another religion immediately. Not only is the older priest offensive, the housekeeeper is a joke. The actress is terrible. The character is the nosiest character that I have ever seen on TV (except for Gladys Kravitz, who was funny).  She, like Fitzgibbons, judges everyone. And I mean everyone! This series presents characters who are 'holier than Thou"" and have little understanding of human nature.
Poor Dick York. He seems to be stuck in a series that really doesn't know what to do with the character that he plays. And then, there's Gene Kelly, who looks like he made a BIG mistake in doing this series. He is probably turning in his grave everytime someone watches this series.
I know there are a few reviewers who thought this series showed a better time; to me it is one of the most offensive TV series ever put on television. Proceed with caution...",1364083200,5,1622,4.593103448275862

8486448,5,B005TN1SE0,"This series shows how absolutely great TV once was. There are thirty episodes on eight well-packged one-sided DVDs. I'm told the show didn't run longer due to the excellent shows it ran against, like ""Dobie Gillis"", another fantastic show that has also been brought out on DVD by Timeless Media/ Shout! Factory. Sit coms (if you want to call them that) were light drama, and a lot more happens in these brief shows than in the predictable shows of today. They were all family shows, addressing real problems and situations, without bogging down in ""issues"", and still keeping upbeat and light-hearted. Each show was like a two hour movie musical condensed into a half hour, and they were written with the same care.

This isn't only true of this show, it's true of ""The Beverly Hillbillies"", ""Green Acres"", ""Gidget"", Maybery RFD"" Dobie Gillis"" and about any other show from the time you can name. It's only later TV became obsessed with super violence, disturbing scenes, endless flirtations, pushing imaginary envelopes, and in general, reducing television, as with recent movies, to a series of special effects scenes edited together.

My advice? Cut the cable, pop in a DVD, and answer the implied question, ""going my way?"" resoundingly in the affirmative.",1489881600,2,1259,5.019138755980861

8486452,5,B005TN1SE0,"Going my way - is a television series that was a little ahead of its time, given the religeous nature of the shows topics.  The head of the parish Father Fitsgibon (Leo G Caroll) and his assistant Father O'malley (Gene Kelly) somewhat try to capture what Crosby did in the original Movie. What this brings is a twist with a boys club counselor (Dick York) and multiple family situations revolving around St. Dominiques Church.  Each show is a different twist and type of 'mini-movie'.  While skeptical, I truly loved them all...many young up and coming stars appear on the show and I found out why it didn't last on ABC;s line up...it was up against NBC and CBS a new show the Beverly Hilbillies, Dobies Gillis and The Virginian.  It is too bad they didn't think of rematching and changing its time slot.  I truly do not recall this program and seems like, in 1962/63 I would have been more engaged with the other shows mentioned.  However, this was a great opportunity to view CLASSIC TV with fine performances!  You will not be dissapointed...even with todays standards, it holds up and very entertaining.",1443916800,,1107,4.704663212435233
8486453,4,B005TN1SE0,"Based on the Oscar winning film with Bing Crosby and Barry Fitzgerald, Gene Kelly ably steps into the Fr. O'Malley role. A pre Bewitched Dick York plays the youth center director, and Leo G. Carroll is fine as Fr. Fitzgibbon. Some top guest stars like Ellen Burstyn and Eddie Bracken add to the depth of the acting. Charming and fun.",1431907200,2,333,4.566666666666666
