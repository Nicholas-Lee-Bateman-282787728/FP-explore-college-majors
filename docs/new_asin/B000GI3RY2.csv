8132738,5,B000GI3RY2,He is my new really under rated actor.  Finding him in the Movie Winter's Tale made me understand how great an actor he is and will continue to be.  I am glad that I bought some of his movie DVD'S.,1394150400,,197,3.9
8132739,3,B000GI3RY2,"The collection of films is a good choice, but the films are described as being in widescreen. The only film in the box set that is shown in the correct 2:35 ratio is ""A Home at the End of the World."" An excellent film!

""Alexander"" & ""American Outlaws"" are Full Screen presentations! I enjoyed Colin Farrell's performance in the films, but it was distracting that the films were not presented correctly. Why in the world would Warner Bros. do this? First of all, TV's are moving to the widescreen screen format and collectors generally enjoy viewing their movies in the original format and not some badly cropped image that some technician mutilates the directors original presentation.",1168128000,15,686,4.913793103448276
