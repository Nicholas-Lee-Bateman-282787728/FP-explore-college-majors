4295593,5,B004A8KGKW,"If you like movies with giant snakes, this one is for you. Way better then Anaconda, no cgi involved, lots of classic animatronic work. This one features A Half African King Cobra mixed with a Eastern  Diamondback Rattler.",1424736000,,222,4.842105263157895
4295594,5,B004A8KGKW,"I love this story.  It's one of the best snake movies I have seen.
My favorite karate ""guy"" is great in this movie.
It's a love story and scary snake movie in one.",1418601600,2,163,3.9393939393939394

4295596,5,B004A8KGKW,"I have always loved snakes and KING COBRA, Seth, was always the best. The movie takes place in a small town, as most do, and makes for an interesting movie. Its 93 Minutes of pure evil.",1392422400,2,185,4.166666666666667
8419631,3,B004A8KGKW,"My only comment is that Casey (Kasey) Fallo, who plays the lady officer Jo, was only in one other film. It's too bad because she is beautiful and a very damn good actress.  There's no other information about her on the internet.  And that's a shame.",1521072000,,249,4.391304347826087
8419632,2,B004A8KGKW,"Some mildly entertaining moments, but far too many poor ""special"" effects and completely ridiculous moments.  For example:  Does anyone seriously believe that a scientifically-altered, hyper-aggressive snake the size of a tractor trailer is going to give what amounts to a love bite to its unsuspecting human prey?  Personally I think it would get medieval on their hineys, so that was a disappointment.  Similarly, the girl sitting in the woods in a rocking chair in the middle of nowhere makes absolutely no sense.  But when Erik Estrada was portrayed as flamboyantly gay, that was the final straw.  Poncharello gay??  Never!

Anyway, it's somewhat entertaining here and there, but definitely isn't something I'd ever buy or even watch again.",1505174400,,744,5.299145299145299

8419634,5,B004A8KGKW,"I did not purchase this dvd on Amazon. However, I just watched it on Syfy. Loved it! Waiting for it to come back on in 2 hours. About to go to sleep and set an alarm. Will be buying off Amazon soon.",1470355200,,198,3.738095238095238

8419636,2,B004A8KGKW,"When a team of scientists test an experimental drug that increases aggression in animals and humans, their biochemical lab explodes and a mutated nightmare escapes. Half African King Cobra and half Eastern Diamondback Rattlesnake, Seth is pure evil. He's 30 feet long with a giant appetite for terror. This is the product description from this movie from 1999. Give this one a lot of wiggle room. Do not take this seriously in any way. the ""effects"" are terrible, the acting is awful (Scott Brandon and kasey Falid) you have to know you are in trouble when the movie stars...Pat Morita! ( I kept waiting for a ""wax on, wax off"".) One scene has a little girl sitting in a wooden chair in the middle of the woods??????? Why????? this is mostly ""D"" list stars....Courtney Gaines at the beginning playing an impatient scientist?????? Really?",1467417600,,837,4.86013986013986
