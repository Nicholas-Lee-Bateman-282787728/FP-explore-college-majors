2189276,3,B0006IIPJE,"This animation from the very beginning I got lost in the storyline it was very confusing didn't understand what was going on it does take place back in the samurai. By the had cars like robots it just was very confusing computer, electrical it just totally lost me. So it was all right, but the rating from five stars I would have to give it lease 3 1/2 stars.",1377388800,2,360,4.231884057971015

2189278,2,B0006IIPJE,"I bought this ova because the character art was reportedly from Rumiko Takahashi. Maybe the original sketches were, but the animation is subpar. The story is threadbare, childish and repetitious, and the relationship to japanese legends is lame pretense. Only the music sounds good-but there are only a few seconds of it. Sorry.",1249862400,,328,5.2075471698113205
2189279,4,B0006IIPJE,"The city is under siege and paranormal phenomenas are to blame.  Who do you call?  No need toc call anyone... the Mobile Shinsengumi are there.

  Who are the Mobile Shinsengumi?  They are the daughters of Shinsengumi heroes featuring team leader Kondou Yuko, Hijikata Toshie and Okita Kaoru who follow in their father's footsteps as loyal guardian heroes in this 4-OAV series by Hiroi Ohji (""Sakura Wars"", ""Virgin Fleet"") and character designs by Takahashi Rumiko (""Urusei Yatsura"", ""Ranma 1/2"", ""Inuyasha"").

  The storyline of ""Moeyo Ken"" revolves around three daughters of shinsengumi heroes protecting their city against demons, ghosts and the Gods that people believed in Japan's yesteryear.  Throw in plot devices such as destruction caused by our heroes and the people they protect, despising them to the heroes owing money or broke because they aren't making money doing the job they do, that's ""MoeyoKen"".

  I would have to admit that watching the first episode, I found ""Moeyo Ken"" a bit campy.  With several anime series out there that take on the Meiji era and even more that focus on samurai action, it was interesting to see the daughters of the shinsengumi in mobile arbor and in a Batman-like vehicle.

  I figured that I should ease up and not take this anime in too seriously and question how modern technology got into the mobile shinsegumi's hands (ie. too not be too analytical) and just enjoy the anime as is.  Afterall, Hiroi's ""Sakura Wars"" is similar yet totally different and so I figured that I needed to watch more episodes.

  Episode 1 features the mobile shinsengumi's battle vs. the wanyuudou, a wheel-shaped monster bearing a human face.  Also, a battle with the photograph monster who steals the souls of people.  More or less an episode introducing the main and supporting characters and how the villagers view our three heroes.

  But who is responsible in resurrecting these spirits and why?
  It was until I watched OAV episodes 2-4 when each episode focused on each of the Mobile Shinsengumi characters is when I started to enjoy ""Moeyo Ken"" much more.

  As for the DVD, the animation combines the cool character designs of Takashi Rumiko and 3D renderings of the Mobile Shinsengumi vehicle and headquarters.

  I must admit it felt weird seeing the 3D renderings in this anime especially since it's used mainly in the vehicle scenes but in some instances, such as 3D use in buildings look quite nice.  The anime is presented in 4:3 ratio.

  As for the audio, I listened to the Japanese 2.0 track and the English 5.1 track.  Although I am more biased towards the Japanese track for my anime viewing, the English vocal track is good.

  Special features on this DVD include production art, character sketches, 3D model art, ""Moeyo Ken"" bestiary and the clean opening an closing theme animations.

  It's definitely nice to watch a Hiroi Ohji anime series and ""Moeyo Ken"" is a type of series that would be great if it became a television series.

  There are many characters in this anime aside from our three main characters that are so fun and interesting, that it would be fun to explore the storylines of each of them.

  I enjoyed ""Moeyo Ken"" and I would definitely love to see more. With so many interesting characters, several unanswered questions, I hope that the OAV series will evolve into a television series.",1218585600,,3361,4.891459074733096
2189280,5,B0006IIPJE,"The Shinsengumi was organized for the specific reason of keeping Kyouto safe from influences which would hinder Japan's efforts towards westernization, be those demons and monsters of every shape and size or a band of misanthropes bent on turning the clock back for the city of Kyou.",1137888000,2,283,5.042553191489362
2189281,2,B0006IIPJE,"I had heard a bit about this OVA when I began watching it. The list of people involved was impressive, (How can you beat Character designs by Rumiko Takahashi?) and the story sounded great as well. Three daughters of Shinsengumi swordsmen protecting a town against monsters and demons, all while the townspeople resist the westernization of their village.

By the second episode, though, I was beginning to have my doubts. Each episode involves the girls fighting some sort of monster (After going through a stock-animation ""shielding up"" sequence.) and revealing a tiny bit about their past, with very little to hold them all together but a side-story about a necklace.

In the end, I lost interest in this anime and stopped watching it about ten minutes in to the last episode. The only true bright spots about this OVA are the character designs and the theme song. This is one DVD you can easily pass up.",1123804800,,907,4.8076923076923075
2189282,5,B0006IIPJE,"A couple of the greatest names in anime are behind this derivative but memorably offbeat series. Rumiko Takahashi is the creator of ""Ranma 1/2"", ""Urusei Yatsura"" and ""Inu-Yasha"". Ouji Hiroi is the creator of ""Sakura Wars"" and ""Gungrave OD"". The two of them collaborated on this entertaining OVA (Original Video Animation) which is set during the Meiji Restoration period.

The residents of Kyoto have had to deal with demons on a daily basis and now have the Mobile Shinsengumi team to aid them with their ongoing problem. The team is made up of three young women: Yuuko, Toshie and Kaoru, who are daughters of three of the most well known members of the Shinsengumi -- a team of assassins and protectors who are hired by a regime to overthrow the Shogun. The Shinsengumi are master swordsmen who will battle to the death to serve their cause.

To aid them in their battle against the demons, the Mobile Shinsengumi employs an array of outlandish devices. For example, they use a high-speed vehicle that resembles a race car, but features wooden computers with wooden keyboards! The most amusing weapon the girls use is a huge cannon that shoots out powerful magical armor that the girls wear to scare away the demons. The only drawback with these girls is that they seem to cause more problems than they solve!

There isn't a great deal of meaningful character development in the series, but that's because this show is intended to be nothing more than fast-paced and outlandish fun. It doesn't exactly aim very high, but it does fulfill its modest aspirations in a splendidly quirky fashion. The character designs are attractive and it's readily apparent that Takahashi has not lost her artistic touch or her fondness for sight gags and physical humor. The female characters are sweet and engaging without ever becoming too sappy or weak.

Overall, this series is a highly amusing creation that will remind anime fans of such memorable series as ""Sakura Wars"" and ""Dirty Pair"". If you're an admirer of ""Sakura Wars"" or the works of Rumiko Takahashi (and who isn't?) then ""Moeyo Ken: A Clash from the Past"" will make a nice addition to your DVD library. However, if you're looking for something dark or serious then you should probably be looking elsewhere. After all, these girls just wanna have fun.",1115596800,4,2302,4.864795918367347
2189283,4,B0006IIPJE,"This is a strange and funny show that will amuse viewers with its bizarre melding of early Kyoto and modern day technology.  More of an heir apparent to ""Ranma 1/2"" than the epic ""Inuyasha"" could ever be, this mindless but entertaining series is highly recommended to comedy fans and those who enjoy switching off their brains as they watch anime.",1115424000,2,347,4.783333333333333
2189284,2,B0006IIPJE,"an anime of great potential wasted. Dirty Pair + one goes to the Meji Restoration. While the techinal quailty of the DVD is good,  the story owes more to the Dirty Pair idea of girls are chaos in action. not to metion the kommi reconstrustion company is alive and well in this past era. Plots are a streight line and character development is non exsistant and the cat demons has some of the better lines.

 On the other hand if your young enough not to care about that or if your in the right frame of mind it can quaility as a gulity pleasure.",1106611200,,544,4.211538461538462
