1844579,5,B00008G8QC,"this 25 minute animation ranks pretty high on my list, and it easily out-strips movies 20 times this length.  the premise is simple, two lovers are seperated by the span of light years and the only means of communication is via text messaging; however, the implications of the myriad of emotions the two must endure: feelings of loss, hope, despair, love... is captured in a beautifully backdropped package rather compactly.  the viewer can see the logical progression without feeling as if the production were rushed or dumbed down.
as some other reviewers have been so clamorous to point out, the running time IS only 25 minutes.  i bought it thinking it would be a feature length movie but the fact that it is so short leaves THAT much more to the imagination.  the impact is powerful, and while sometimes i do wish it were longer, its open-endedness has left me many sleepness nights of dreaming up my own endings.  i recommend viewing this feature in the original japanese language with subtitles (i don't understand japanese either) because the english voiceovers seem a bit unenthusiastic.  a lot more meaning comes out from the original inflections.
plus, the extras bundled along with the main feature are great as well.  watch She and Her Cat on the 3 minute version, it is not so short that you feel bereft of meaning and not so long that it becomes garbled.  if you dig poetry, the lines speak like poetry.  the interview with the creator was fun too, he's passionate about his work and its inspiring that he created all this from his home computer.
perhaps one of the best things about this DVD is its replay value.  with every viewing, i notice more details and catch a bit more of the underlying subtleties.  it is fun popping it in when you're bored or want a quick animation fix and it's something i wouldn't mind taking a couple minutes to show a friend and then having a discussion about afterwards, because these kinds of clips BREED discussion.
if you're looking for mindless action sequences, slapstick comedy, or half-naked fembots then this probably isn't for you.  but if you're looking for something more thoughtful, a break from ""everything else""... then i recommend it 100%.
hope this helps, goodnight.",1058918400,2,2230,4.80890052356021
1844580,4,B00008G8QC,"I picked up this short film (~25 minutes) at an anime convention.  The art is simply beautiful.  About 5 minutes into watching it, I was really annoyed with the subtitles moving too fast and taking up a third of the screen; so I switched to the English dub.  To my surprise, the English language track was well done.  It was nicely acted and the voices matched the characters properly.  This is mostly an art film.  A short story about lovers separated by space and time.  It reminded me a bit of Orson Scott Card's ""Speaker for the Dead"" (or Einstein's theory of space travel if you want to split hairs).  The girl travels far out in space aging days, while her love back home ages years.  The further out she travels, the longer her messages take to get back home.  The pain of these two aching lovers is real and sad, and at the same time beautiful.
As usual, ADV charges a lot more than they should for this movie.  The ""Girl and Cat"" short 5 minute story was nice little supplement, though.  So even though the price may seem a little steep, I think it's worth it for this lovely piece of art.",1058832000,7,1098,4.328431372549019
1844581,5,B00008G8QC,"I met my wife over the internet, and we spent two years in a long distance relationship. I'm also a military brat, and when the call would come, we would never know when or if we would see Dad again.
Perhaps that's why Voices of a Distant Star struck such a chord with me. I felt that I could relate to the plight of the characters, as they struggled to cope with distance, uncertainty, and absence.
This brought tears to my eyes, and that's saying alot. The emotions are genuine, and the art...well, you would hardly believe that the whole thing was put together on a home PC.
Granted, this isn't a long piece, but this is most definitely a story that will remain in your heart for a long time.",1058054400,,695,4.312977099236641
1844582,5,B00008G8QC,"This is a work of art with a great emotional impact.  It touches on a little bit of everything that makes us what we are: love, fear and even rage.  Right up there with ""Grave of the Fireflies"", ""Ghost in the Shell"" or ""Perfect Blue"".
I had no problems with my DVD, so I can't comment on any listed by other reviewers.",1057622400,,318,4.112903225806452
1844583,2,B00008G8QC,"I thought the premise of this sounded good.  It turned out to be one of those things we regular folk just don't get.  Now I love anime in most of its forms, except gratuituous mecha.  I had hopes for this one as a good, sci-fi topic.  It might have made an impression, had it been a bit longer.  As it was, its hardly worth the money for a 25 minute runtime, when I was expecting a bit more of a movie.
I've seen some excellent award winning, short animations, where the animation itself told a great story. I will admit there are a few parts like that in this film.  Unfortunately, there are also time wasting, still shot moments, which should only be part of a longer piece.  In the end, I was left with a lot of questions, and maybe that was the point of it all.  I still hate it when the existential artists make something, and their patrons tell us we should all like it.  If you like thought pieces OK, but I'd still advise renting this one first.",1057622400,4,953,4.1923076923076925
1844584,3,B00008G8QC,"I was very intrigued with this anim ever since I first saw some trailers on Newtype DVD's. I grew even more intrigued when I heard that the animation and CG graphics were all done by one man. So, when I heard this had been released, I picked it up and immediately watched it upon my return home.
What I saw was a stunning work of moving art. The animation, at face value, is absolutely incredible, and the fact that it was all done by one man makes it even more so. The music isn't remarkable, though it works and suits the mood welle nough. The director is able to weave a grandiose story quite well within a timnefarme of a half hour. I was afraid that, in this anim's short amount of screentime, the characters would not be developed well enough and that the story would feel incomplete or unfinished. Luckily, however, Makoto Shinkai proved me wrong. There are some ludicrous moments in the story, however. I find it hard to believe that either character would continue to subscribe in a long-distance relationship without fail or without looking at the other options around them (particularly, even when the distance between them can be measured in light years. Even though I'm sure there will be great advances in technology within the next few decades, I still find it hard to believe that a cell phone can actually transmit a signal over the course of eight light years. But, I suppose it's safe to say that a good love story isn't created with rationalists in mind. If you can suspend belief in what makes logical sense, or in other words, you're a romantic, you'll enjoy the story.
One reviewer compared it with the greatness of Evangelion, though I'm not sure if this is an appropriate comparison. Evangelion and Voices of a Distant Star are both astounding works, but they are also completely different. I would classify this as a moving story with a remarkable emotional punch, one that will be viewed by few people, yet will undoubtedly profoundly affect the few who do watch it. Thus, I would compare it to the greatness of ""Grave of the Fireflies"" or ""Now and Then, Here and There.""
The short animated film, ""She and Her Cat,"" which was directed by Makoto Shinkai as well, is unique, mildly perplexing, and an excellent addition.
As it is, I would give this remarkable DVD 4 stars.
However, the reason why this got a three and not a four is the responsibility of ADV films, the distributor of this film. I'm not one for english voice dubs; I hardly ever choose dubs over subs (Cowboy Bebop being the unique exception), thus I haven't heard the dub. If you're one for dubs, then go ahead and pretend I gave this 4 stars.
Before I continue, let me just say that I'm not one of those otaku that gets offended if ""what was that"" is used in place of ""nani"" (which is what in Japanese). I don't look for a perfect translation, simply one that conveys the story in general well enough. The tempo of the subtitles here, though, drove me crazy. Some were far too verbose to be read in time, while others were quite terse. As erratic as the timing may be, I was still able to notice numerous misspellings. Considering how I've never had this problem with the 43 other anim DVD's that I have, I think it's safe to assume that whoever translated this didn't spend enough time making sure that the timing and the content of the subtitles was as good as the anim at hand. Not only that, but the ""Original Production Animatic"" was left untranslated; there are no subtitles or voice dubs at all!
Overall, it's worth the money if you don't mind a disappointing translation or a very short anim feature.",1055980800,4,3601,4.558641975308642
1844585,2,B00008G8QC,"The feature is great! No question!
But currently I can't recommend this DVD for purchase.
As I discovered in a newsgroup there are several problem with this release.
The most important one:
The soundtrack featuring the director and his wife is MISSING!
It was checked by several people. There are two sound version on this disc, but there are actually the same!
So if you plan to purchase this disc, please remember that you probably won't get what you expected.

1844586,5,B00008G8QC,"So much anime is dull, and over used plots and ideas.  Many are just ways to joke about sex and look at cartoons in swim suits (pathetic).
And then there is anime like Voices of a Distant Star.  Also called Hoshi no Koe in Japanese this is an incredible anime.  An amzing adventure, while short, will leave you breathless.  More character depth than almost any other anime out their.  This should be what people watch and compare other animes to.  Now the most amazing fact:  This enitre movie was animated, and computer graphics and colorized, and scripted by one man.  Not a whole team of ""pros""  just one man and one Power Macintosh G4 400.  The best version is to watch him and his wife do the voices(with subtitles),they get so passionate towards eachother it is amazing.  I've read that this version will be inclueded on the DVD I can't wait to watch this movie with correct subtitles!  The music was fantastic, I hope they release the soundtrack for America as well.  Everything in this Anime flows like nothing you've ever seen, an emotional journey, breathtaking and lovey, I hope other Animes learn from Makoto Shinkai.
For those of you wondering how I saw this, an american version has been released already.  It has very poor sub titles and no english voices.  I wouldn't recomend it, since in 10 days the offical american version will be released.
I wish there was an extra star to give to movies like this, also if you enjoy this Anime stay alert, Makoto is working on his next anime...Andrew",1054425600,41,1506,4.630188679245283

The story is top-notch; a love story set against an unusually good sci-fi backdrop. I'm still at a loss for words on how good this anime is...
However, when I went online to see if there were other 'episodes' to continue the series, I found out that ONE MAN had done EVERYTHING on the anime ALL BY HIMSELF. I feel humbled and (again) dumbstruck. Had this been a longer epic, it would be one of the best in the history of anime - EASILY on par with Evangelion and the likes. I can only hope that there is more story to tell...

I call it an OVA because it is very detailed but not long enough to be a movie and only slightly longer then a single TV episode.

1844679,5,B00008G8QC,"This is one of those achingly beautiful love stories that I've seen come from only the Japanese, along the lines of either 'ef' story, 'Saikano' or '5 centimeters per second'. Maybe only the Japanese have the courage to tell an inherently sad story?

I'll not repeat the excellent (and some not-so-excellent) remarks above - those very well give much of the mechanics and history of the story.

The story is sad, heartbreakingly sad. You have permission to cry, even you guys. The story isn't a total downer, there is hope for the two lovers. The best thing about the story is that this is indeed left unresolved, it allows you the viewer to create your own ending in your head, in your heart - rather than beating you over the head with the ending you want but don't really need.

 For maybe 30 minutes total of video it may seem pricey, but this is truly priceless.",1363046400,,867,4.538461538461538
1844680,5,B00008G8QC,"Shinkai's artistry never ceases to amaze, the clean-cut and starkly-yet-beautifully realistic scenery is so beautiful that you could take any background shot and make a powerful work of art with no editing whatsoever. This surely has a lot to do with the way Shinkai and his studio produce the art--one photograph at a time, redrawn by hand from scratch.

The story is compelling, but can feel out of place without the proper contextual understanding of postwar Japan. I would definitely recommend a primer in postwar Japanese psychology/sociology to supply proper context to enjoy this masterpiece. Much of the symbology also revolves a bit around the issues that Japan dealt with postwar.

All in all a powerful story with chillingly beautiful animation style that lends its full weight to the tale being told.",1351728000,,812,5.143939393939394

It mystifies me why a product with neither attribute is offered for sale in Amazon US or UK when there are Amazon sites specifically tailored to process products in foreign languages.

1844684,4,B00008G8QC,"`Voices of A Distant Star' is a short animation produced entirely on the directors home computer. For this reason alone the animation and artwork seems especially rich and impressive. Light music flows almost constantly underneath the story and the English dubbing is pretty good. The story follows a female pilot who goes into space and who communicates via text messages which take longer and longer to reach her boyfriend as she goes deeper into space. Essentially it is a love story with a futuristic setting. It is very short, but well thought out and executed and is good if you fancy some anime but don't want a full length feature. The extras are pretty good as well. Worth a look if you're a fan of japanimation.

1844759,3,B00008G8QC,"This movie was a lot more abstract than I was expecting. Its very short, only half an hour long, so the story can't be developed in any great length, but the film went ahead with the characters emotionally without giving the audience some kind of back story to help them catch up. Basically, if you want to relate to this movie you'll have to do a lot of the work yourself, which isn't necessarily a negative, but it's not what I was expecting and it wasn't done well enough to make me forget that that wasn't what I was expecting.

The story follows two high school aged sweethearts, Mikako and Noboru, who were separated at the beginning of high school because Mikako accepts a mission to fly a mecha man across the solar system to fight aliens on a distant planet (which is interesteing to consider in a gender role sense because most of the time is it the guy who goes away to war or to explore and the girl stays home to wait). As she flies further and further away she tries to text Noboru and the more she travels the more years it will take to reach him. She finally reaches a faraway planet that is 8 light years away from earth and she sends a text, by the time he gets the text he's moved on with his life but they both say that they regret not having lived with each other.

I found that I couldn't really connect with the characters very well, Mikako was curled up in a ball crying all the time, even when she was fighting aliens. Noboru was distant and cool and when the time came, gave up on the supposed love of his life way too easily for the audience to believe that he cared at all in the first place. There are very few flashbacks, but the ones provided show them talking casually as friends or hanging out and were not really emotionally charged enough to set up Mikako's constant tears (which is why I said that you would have to do a lot of the emotional leg work by yourself, in your own head, because its not in the film).

Aside from the plot though, the art was beautiful. The drawing of the characters were not to my taste, but the scenery was stunning. Really beautiful artwork. I believe this was done almost wholly by one artist, which is amazing.",1278547200,2,2178,4.281553398058253
1844760,4,B00008G8QC,"I think this movie will find itself compared to its younger sibling, 5cm per Second, the same way that The Ring and Ringu are compared or Infernal Affairs (Tony Leoung) is compared to The Departed (Leonardo Dicaprio). Both are good but it really depends on which one you watched first.

I watched 5cm first and because of that, I can almost recognize this movie, Voices, as being the ""warm up"" of the general idea. The big contrast that one could offer is that whereas in 5cm is grounded in every day life, Voices uses the idea of space travel as another obstacle for two people being together. However, the element of time dilation was not fully appreciated (or exploited) in Voices.

In the Sci-fi series Gun Buster, the concept of space travel and time dilation is better integrated into the story. In Gun Buster one can see and feel the sense of abandonment/distancing that the main character experiences as she ages (much) slower than her friends/peers. With each mission, we see the main character being left behind as her friends and peers simply live and move along. At one point the difference between timelines is so large, that for contemporaries it makes no difference with death, friends will never see each other again, even if they continue to live.

Overall I did like the Voices, but also think that I was lucky to have seen 5cm first and so enjoyed the benefit of not knowing Shinkai's themes of separated love. I was able to absorb 5cm to the fullest with no clue of the director's likely conclusion.",1274054400,,1519,4.681647940074907
1844761,5,B00008G8QC,"This is one of my favorite anime movies. The story, while simple, has a lot of heart. The fact that one person did the work and not a studio is impressive. However, because one person did the work it shows in the details, hence the 4-star rating.

The things I picked up on were the type-o's on the computer screen inside the mecha such as ""Untile"" instead of ""Until"". The robot voice that alerts our young mecha pilot that ""Tarsians are existing everywhere"" is evidence of a poor translation. But these are really just nitpicks.

If you let go and allow yourself to connect with the characters you can feel the raw emotion brought on by their loss. Especially the scene where our pilot meets the young alien on the Tarsian home world.

For me that was the main strength of this short movie.

Some may call it sappy, but I think if you liked movies such as 5 centimeters per second, you'll like this one even more.",1267056000,,914,4.4226190476190474

My only complaint is that there is not enough of it.

1844764,5,B00008G8QC,"As usual, not only am I late for the party, but when I do arrive I walk in a** backwards. Such is the case of my personal discovery of director Makoto Shinkai. The first movie of his that I saw was 5 Centimeter per Second, which despite its sincerity was much too sappy for my taste. Yet, Shinkai's artwork was compelling enough to take a stab at Voice of a Distant Star, which came highly recommended by a friend -- four years ago. I'm not kidding. It was that long ago, and I finally got around to seeing it.

Never has the expression ""better late then never"" been so appropriate. No matter how long you wait, you really shouldn't let this one slip past you. In fact, see it before you see 5 Centimeters, which was produced after Distant Star. Now that I've seen the latter, I better appreciate many of the visual elements of the former. Distant Star hasn't changed my opinion about 5 Centimeters, but it does soften it.

The story of Distant Star is remarkably simple and brilliantly original. A teenage girl, Mikako Nagamine, goes into deep space with the United Nations army. She leaves behind her boyfriend, Noboru Terao. For reasons that probably has something to do with the Space-Time in Einstein's General Relativity and the Black Holes of Stephen Hawkings, Mikako doesn't age as she travels into ever more distant galaxies. She attempts to stay in touch with Noboru by sending emails through her cell phone. But the further she travels, the longer it takes for the messages to reach him -- eventually as long as 8 years.

Unlike Mikako, Noboru ages while he suffers the long lapses between messages from his lost love. First months go by between messages. Next years. Eventually, he must move on.

Unlike 5 Centimeters, where the narrative is overloaded with exposition, with Distant Star the poignancy of the characters is never explained away. It's left exactly where it is supposed to be -- in the painful body language of the characters. Occasionally, the emails sent to Noboru are read to us by Mikako's voice, but here it is well done. The messages do not come off as bad poetry, but instead the true anxiety of a young girl who knows that she may never see her boyfriend again. The ending of Distant Star is by far one of the most memorable I have ever seen -- and possibly even the best, or at least, among the best.

5 Centimeters relives this theme of early separation, and many of the visual motifs that were used in Distant Star are revisited in 5 Centimeters. I can now see that Makoto Shinkai has very early on discovered for himself both a directing style and tonality that warrants him being called a master. More astonishing than anything else is that Distant Star was done entirely by Shinkai on his desktop computer. If the budget technology shows in the first few minutes, it disappears soon after as you are lost in a compelling story and graphical execution that still holds up to our standards 5 years later. The scene of Mikako on a planet in the Sirius star system rivals the lush work of Miyazaki. Believe me, that's saying something.

At only 30 minutes, there are few reasons to not see this anime short. Even if cartoons aren't your cup of tea, you may find Distant Star to be the rare exception.",1247184000,2,3236,4.5899653979238755
1844765,3,B00008G8QC,I thought this movie was alright. It was a bit sad and it was interesting and well done but I didn't like it all that much. I saw 5 centimeters per second before seeing this movie and I liked 5 centimeters per second much much better. Not bad to check out but I think you can expect better from Shinkai's later releases.,1240531200,,320,4.17741935483871
1844843,5,B00008G8QC,"""Voices of a Distant Star"" is like a great short story.  Clocking in at under 30 minutes, it manages to hit emotional heartstrings more powerfully than some longer movies can.

The story takes place after an alien race called Tarsians have started attacking the human race, starting with an attack on the moon.  Mikako, a teenage girl, has joined the fight as a pilot.  With her cell phone, she periodically sends text updates to Noboru, a boy she knew from school back on earth.  But, as her mission takes her farther and farther from earth, those messages take longer and longer to reach him, and as he begins to receive messages from a Mikako who hasn't aged as much as he, their longing for each other grows, as they remember a simpler time together.

Like all great stories, this movie focuses on its characters and their emotions, deftly mixing in battle sequences with heart-to-hearts.  I also liked the added scientific dimension of text messages taking longer and longer to reach their destination the farther out in space Mikako goes.  This movie utilizes that fact to emphasize how vast the physical distance is between the two of them, and yet the farther apart they become spatially, the closer together they become emotionally, driving the story towards its emotional and poignant climax.

As for the visuals, they are beautiful, but many of them also serve to create a mood, whether it's rain that drives Mikako and Noboru to shelter, or the light snow that falls while Noboru receives one of Mikako's messages.

My only complaints with the movie have to do with the dubbing and the subtitles.  Other discs give the option of removing subtitles from the screen: why ADV did not do that for this release is puzzling, especially for people who want to hear the Japanese without subtitles cluttering the screen.  Also, why subtitle the song?  It's in English, and the lyrics are included with the DVD.
As for dubbing, the opening sentences don't match the meaning of the opening Japanese sentences as closely as the subtitles do, and since there isn't any mouth to match the words to in the beginning of the movie, why use different words with a completely different meaning?  Also, why does the voice actor doing Mikako's voice have an accent?  Did I miss a country dialect in the Japanese version?

Translation issues aside, this is one of the best movies I have ever seen, animated or otherwise.  And, because it's so short, you can watch and enjoy it again and again.  Also comes with bonus features, including ""She and Her Cat"" in three versions of differing length, which was the previous short film done by the creator of this movie.",1226448000,,2652,4.7785087719298245
1844844,3,B00008G8QC,"Voices of a Distant Star is an anime Original Video Animation (OVA) directed and produced by Makoto Shinkai on his Macintosh computer.  The film tells a love story between Mikako (a middle-school girl drafted into the UN Space Army) and Noboru.  They try to stay in communication by utilizing the e-mail capabilities on their cell phones.  As the ship Mikako is on travels deeper and deeper into space, the time it takes for a message to reach Noboru on Earth takes longer.  Mikako's final message takes eight years to reach Noboru.

Voices of a Distant Star uses the theory of relativity to tell an interesting story.  However, the production only runs for twenty-five minutes, and it feels like the story isn't finished.  As a viewer, I really wanted to know what happens to both Mikako and Noboru.  The animation is lush, and the music is beautiful, but it feels like Shinkai ended the story too soon.  However, when you watch this film, you can see the filmmaking style that Shinkai used when he produced The Place Promised in Our Early Days.

The DVD release of Voices of a Distant Star includes some extras.  The first is three versions of She and Her Cat, one of the first shorts Makoto Shinkai produced.  There is a ""Digest Version"" that runs for one-and-a-half minutes, a three-minute version, and a five-minute version.  It's a black and white piece that tells the story of a cat and a young woman who owns him.  There is an interview with Makoto Shinkai, a ""Director's Cut"" of Voices of a Distant Star, the Original Production Animatic, the original Japanese trailers for Voices of a Distant Star, and ADV Previews.

While Voices of a Distant Star was an interesting story, I'm not sure I could recommend purchasing this DVD for full price.  Between the short runtime for the actual production, and that most of the extras are alternate versions of the production, I'm not convinced it's worth the cost.  However, if you can track down a used copy of the DVD for a cheaper purchase price, then it might be worth the money to pick it up.",1226361600,2,2047,4.673184357541899

1844847,4,B00008G8QC,"Much as already been written about this piece in the reviews so I will just give my take/recommendations.  I very much enjoyed Voices of a Distant Star.  I will say that yeah, it was a bit short but I am glad I own it.  I also enjoy collecting anime for its art style.  Those who may not want to commit to the price of owning may still want to consider buying it used or renting it as I feel it is a worthwhile watch.

I will say that while the story is in the scifi genre, it's not the point of the piece.  The story of this piece, it's focus is the relationship between the two leads.  Everything else is background.  Don't expect to learn about the war, how the mecha work, or anything like that.  It's all about these two characters and THEIR relationship.  That's it.

The music is great (so much so I bought the soudtrack).  Well, it's great if you enjoy piano.

I will leave you with one final note.  I found the dubbing fine but I make a point to watch the subtitle selection just to see if there is any changes to the translations.  It is in the subtitled bits that the newspapers are translated and there is important information in the headlines.  Hit that pause button and read.  I guess I have one more suggestion too, watch it a few times to catch the details in the scenes that go unspoken.  Hey, the movie is short so you can do this easily, haHA.  The composition of the scenes and what is in them are so important to the story and provide much subtext to what ISN'T said by the characters.",1218672000,,1507,4.206293706293707

Voices of a Distant Star delivers. While yes, it's barely over 23 minutes long, the amount of emotion and visual beauty packed into those 23 minutes surpasses the majority of Hollywood films.

 I hadn't heard of Makoto Shinkai until this year, with all the hype from 5 Centimeters Per Second, which I also adored, but I'm glad I know of him now. I will definitely be keeping an eye on all of his works, much the same as with Miyazaki.

I do not believe those were the intensions of the film. I think he wanted to show you love. Love that superceeds distance and time, though both are great factors in this equation.

The movie itself, bonus features aside, is only about a half hour. I would give this as a suggestion to an anime buff dude who would like a female friend to get into it as much as he does. The animation is clear, the story simple...it is, in a sense, a very ""pretty"" movie.

It is obvious that Mr. Shinkai did not set out to create a feature-length movie, but rather something far from it. Sometimes, profound and moving things can be said with the fewest words and images. Not to belabor the old cliche, ""a picture is worth a thousand words,"" but, as Mr. Shinkai mentioned in the interview included on the disk, he began with the simple image of a girl sitting in a cockpit and holding a cell phone.

What an awesome film!",1180224000,,267,4.3
1844895,4,B00008G8QC,"Okay, first I would like to put to rest the lie that this movie is of the same standard as Miyazaki's films. It is not. It's a start for an upcoming director, but still not up to Miyazaki's greatness. This is not Miyazaki, so don't expect a Miyazaki type film.

The film itself is great. A young female joins the UN army to help fight off an alien race that has attacked a colony on mars, leaving behind her childhood friend and love. As her fleet moves farther and farther away from earth the time it takes for her messages to get to him take longer and lounger. First its six months, then a year, and then eight. Can their friendship and love survive as he gets older but she remains 15? Will she survive? Will they see each other again?

This isn't so much of a movie than one long dialoged with both characters reminiscing on how they miss each other and how they miss each other. They are they only two characters in this whole movie, a movie that is only 23 minutes long, and their dialogue is mostly them thinking to themselves. This isn't much of a problem however because the movie is so short and doesn't need secondary characters to help the flow of the story.

THE GOOD: first of all the artwork is really, REALLY good. For a guy that made this movie on his Mac, by himself, in his basement, this looks amazing. Whatever you have to say about this anime, good or bad, you have to admit that the animation is top notch. Another great part of the story is the fact that the characters are so well done. Even my none anime sister felt very sorry for the main characters in this film. They might not be as good as some characters in other amines I've seen, but I blame that on the fact that this movie is only 23 minutes long. Also the music is great. I love the music for Miyazaki's movies and I have to say that this music is almost as good.

THE BAD: well let's start with the obvious. It's too short. 23 minutes is not nearly enough time to make a great movie. If only it were lounger this could have been a truly great film, as is it's just a really good short. That's really the only complaint I have, everything else is top notch.

One bit of advice though. watch this movie in English and then watch the original Japanese version with subtitles. The reason for this is that the subtitles go so fast that it's hard to read them and watch the screen at the same time. if you watch it in English than you will know what the story is and then read the differences in the Japanese version. I think its better in Japanese, the dialog is more real and the text messages make the two characters seem more like long time friends, but i had a devil of a time keeping up and kept missing parts.

Overall this is a very good film that deserves to be watched but not up to Miyazaki's greatness. Maybe his nest film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Place-Promised-in-Our-Early-Days/dp/B0009PLMAS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Place Promised in Our Early Days</a>&nbsp;will be a five star movie, but not this one. if you read this review, please leave a comment.",1178236800,3,3111,4.497345132743363

I first rented this from a video shop, I watched it rather bemused the first time, but I was interested. I let it rest a day or two and watched it again, following the story easier the second time, also had the subtitles on and they helped ""fill in the gaps"".

I came to appreciate it was not a fun or action movie, more of a study in love and relationships, and on a concept that cant yet exist, but in the future could. Love over time and space and the paradoxs this could bring.

Its only a half hour movie and that is all it needs as a short story.

They a young couple, but space war sees them separated, they communicate via text messages.

He Noboru, on earth, time moves normally,

She Mikako, a mecha pilot, travels into space, first a few minutes separate their messages. Then she space warps away and comunications take a month, The she again space warps - 8 light years away and of course messages take 8 years to travel one way!.

By the time Noboru gets the last message he is 25 years old.. Things have happened in space.. Things have happened on earth, They have one final message to each other transending space and time..

An interesting movie.. a movie to move the heart. I did not feel it was depressing as one reviewer put it, more a Romeo & Juliet type compassion and sadness for this couple. Some could shed a tear...

The animation and music are fine, but not all that important, its the story that get you, its really a dialog between two people, the sole characters are the couple, and thats it! no one else!

Probably not for every one, so try it before you buy it.. but don't be suprised however if you actualy do go and buy it! Its like that.",1172448000,6,1752,4.268882175226586
1844899,3,B00008G8QC,I love all kinds of Anime. The movie was to short and down right depressing. The end left open and left no real resolution of what happened to the characters. Graphics were good though. Story line was lacking.,1172102400,2,209,4.526315789473684
1844900,4,B00008G8QC,"This anime leaves two very different impressions. One is a clear but complex mix of feelings, as two young lovers, chaste and romantic, are separated by war. She goes off to combat among the star. He never forgets her, but the war carries her light-minutes away, then light-months, then light-years. She sends him her love as often as she can, perhaps every few days of her life, and he looks every day for her messages. Over time, though, he receives them less and less often. The intervals grow from days, to months, to years as her warship carries her farther and farther. Other rifts deepen, too, as the light-decade between them brings him into his twenties, but leaves her as the teenager he last saw. The only strands connecting them are the lines of text she is sometimes able to send. Military rules and pragmatics mean that he can only receive her messages - he is mute. The  sorrow of the situation mostly speaks for itself; whatever the divided lovers feel, they leave largely unsaid. It's a short movie, about 25 minutes. That is all that's needed, though. More directors should exercise such restraint.

The second impression of this movie almost turned me off to it completely. The visual style, though competent in its way, uses way too many of the anime cliches. She always appears in her shortie schoolgirl skirt and playfully dishevelled necktie, even in combat. Everyone features big eyes, tiny mouths, and stick-thin legs. And yes, there are flying robots with the stock assortment of lasers, missiles, and forcefields. If the visual styling could have escaped the ordinary, this could have been new landmark in the world of anime. Ordinary isn't bad, though, so the story carries this movie beautifully.

Extras include the pencil sketches used to rough out the visual story, a director's cut of the movie, and a brief feature lacking English sound or text - interesting, but largely closed to me. The package as a whole, though, is well worthwhile.

Clarke's Space Odyssey 2001 back in 1968. The story is very original yet so simple, you sort of wonder how come no one thought of it before.

By now you probably already know the plot, so I won't go into details about it.

I will admit that the romance and chemistry between the two lovers is brilliantly communicated thru their actions and overwhelms the movie. Yes, there is amazingly shot and animated fight scenes and the animation of the spaceship is ethereal and well done and is also the BEST of what I've seen in this genre of Anime.

The storyline, as usual with most anime, involves kids who never seem to age in personality and physically, but in ""Voices..."" the characters age and the storyline is very mature and the dilemna of love lost is realistically written.

This is where this anime rises above the others and even movies. It's beauty lies in the fact that this is a very believable story that pulls you in and makes you feel what the characters are going thru. Then 27 minutes or so later this brillant movie ends abruptly...too abruptly!

My only wish is that it would have been at least 30 minutes longer. I did understand that the man who made this anime did everything by himself on one MAC computer and even used his wife to voice the girl character and he himself dubbed the boyfriend's voice.  That is amazing in itself!

But maybe, after recieving so much acclaim, just maybe, someone will re-do this movie in a longer 2 hr bigger budget version.

1844924,4,B00008G8QC,"In many ways, Voices of a Distant Star by Makoto Shinkai is a labor of love. He did almost all of the work himself, and the voices are done by he and his wife. This explains the only 30 minute run time.

The story, set in the future, is of Mikako and Noboru. The two are friends in junior high, but only a few years later Mikako is sent off into the military to pilot a mech warrior. Not only that, but she is immediately sent on a super dangerous mission to the far reaches of our galaxy to face the space aliens at their home planet. By the time she gets here, even though it takes a relatively short period of time ""real life"", her cell phone messages back to Noboru now take 8 years to send.

You really have to completely suspend realistic disbelief if you're going to watch and enjoy this movie as a ""romantic tender"" story. There are many issues that kept bugging me. First, this is an incredibly important military mission. They're using 15 year old girls as their front line troops?? Surely, no matter how brilliant this girl is, they're not going to put her in as cannon fodder. It makes no sense at all. Second, they obviously can warp the spaceships to reach their destination in a short period of time. They're not going to have any ability to warp communications back and forth? They're telling their troops to ""write home"" in one scene, but they're sending those messages in a long tedious way that takes 8 years one way? How can they possibly wage a war with that kind of communication? Why would they, when they are zipping entire batallions of troops back and forth with super-fast ease?

But let's agree to ignore all of those issues. The movie isn't about those. In fact even though there are mech robots involved, there are only a few combat scenes. Really, the movie is about time and evolving personalities. You see the gorgeous drifting of white clouds, the tender falling of rain, the wispy snows. Noboru is left on Earth and drifts through these various changes in nature, wondering how Mikako is doing. In the meantime, although Mikako gets to do some sight-seeing as she goes through our own solar system, as soon as she's out ""in the far reaches of space"" all you see of her is her sterile robot and her cell phone. In fact in one scene it really looks like she is abandoned by her fleeing troops because she hesitates in order to grab her cell phone back from where it'd fallen.

As gorgeous and different as the two environments are, though, I really had trouble believing in this connection between the two. They were just friends when they parted. They weren't in love, they weren't clinging to each other declaring their love. In fact we don't even see the parting - just that ""Oh she's gone"". She could easily write him daily, but she chooses to write him VERY infrequently. He gives her the same shallow indifference.

Some people seem VERY confused about the very simple time issue. He is on Earth. She is far away. Her message takes 8 years to get back to him. She sends a message when she is 15. She knows that therefore he'll only get to listen to it when he is 15+8=24 (apparently adjusting for their different birthdays). SHE IS GOING TO BE 24 TOO WHEN THAT TIME COMES!!! If he had sent HER a message on that exact same day that she sent him her message, she would get his message when she was 24. He would get her message when he was 24. They would both get messages that had been written when the pair were 15. It's not like she is ""stuck at 15"" or he is ""aging without her"".

The movie ends with her on the distant planet, feeling lonely and having an injured robot. He is independently about to join the Space Marines :). So who knows, maybe both will die sadly in war without ever finding each other. Maybe they'll serve together. Maybe the war will end and they'll meet up in peace. But since these guys were never even dating, never mind discussing long term relationships, it seems a bit forced.

I definitely appreciate the movie a lot! This is an incredible amount of work to have been done by one person. The characters have a lot of emotion in them. The ""worlds"" they live in are shown to be very different but to have similarities. I just find a lot of the poignancy to be plotted out. I find that a lot of bizarre issues are glossed over, that could easily have been explained. They could have made the relationship far more believable. It just needed a few more tweaks to become an amazing classic.

Now, a note about the DVD. The subtitles are AWFUL. There are long sequences where the characters are having in depth conversations and there are NO subtitles at all. In fact, there is a critical scene where Mikako is on the enemy planet and apparently runs into an enemy unit. They talk to each other - but you have no idea what they are saying! The subtitles are completely missing. Are they both saying they're tired of fighting? Are they saying ""let's get it over with""? Is it even an enemy unit? Apparently we'll never know. They could have done a MUCH much better job subtitling this DVD.",1140480000,6,5051,4.4294940796555435

1844926,5,B00008G8QC,"I also liked the film very much, but I'm writing mostly to ask for clarification. Where are so many people getting the idea that the female character is ""not aging?"" I've seen the idea mentioned in many reviews of the film here as well as numerous reviews on other internet Anime sites. While the different rates of aging attributed to by Einstein's theories may be scientifically valid and is dealt with in many other pieces, I don't believe it is suggested anywhere in this film. Are people referring to the passage in the film where the ""15-year-old"" girl sends a message that she still loves him to the ""24-yaer-old"" boy? Well, she simply uses that expression because it takes over 8 years for the message to reach the boy and by the time the boy receives the message he would have grown to be 24. The two are both 15 at the time the message is being sent and both will be 24 when the message arrives. It suggests that her love for the boy transcends time and space, not her biological rate of aging.

That's what I thought. Did I miss something? Can somebody confirm this?",1137196800,,1077,4.467005076142132
1844927,5,B00008G8QC,"With beautiful animation Voices of a Distant Star stands out brilliantly among the short anime films and OVAS. Visually Voices of a Distant Star is downright beautiful, story-wise it's both innocent and romantic.

The only disappointment was the fact that it was so short. Though on second thought, ""short and sweet"" truly applies here - if Voices was any longer I feel that it's impact would have been lost.

It need not matter that we didn't know the answer as to whether or not the main characters would ever meet again, that wasn't the point of the anime: simply that they loved and maintained their love was the beauty of it. Innocent love, with a tad bit of naivety? You bet, but then again what's so bad about that? The main character seemed to age... sad in comparison with his young love who seemingly remained the same.

If traveling through space takes years as does sending a message through space as seen in the anime, then it makes perfect sense that her love for him would remain in tact but for him it would seem like a lifetime has gone by. This is one of the most remarkable aspects about this animated short, it portrays this excellently in a number of ways - cinematically with rain falling on the older young adult's house as he receives a text message from his childhood love... just truly amazing.

You never quite know the details behind the war the girl is involved in - I've read a number of negative reviews regarding such details failing to be explained - but isn't that just another prime example of how innocent such a love is? It transcends all situations, all circumstances... remains pure throughout the years.

Truly a masterpiece without any obvious flaws!",1132099200,,1691,4.6610738255033555
1844928,3,B00008G8QC,"First if you read most of the other reviews you notice that all of them including mine agree on some things. First the story and animation are very beautiful but where's the rest of it. I have no problem with short anime movies I've seen a bunch but everyone knows some are meant to be short and some are not. This movie to me was not thought out well the story line is so good it needs more to it. Imagine how shocked I was to hear nobody wondering if they were ever going to meet again.

The entire 25 minutes which in their movie time it would be 10 years Mikako one of the main characters pilots her fighter ship in a war your not told much about. She never gets out of the ship, she doesn't eat and if she sleeps it's in the ship. So that's 10 years of nothing just wanting to come home, wanting to taste food again and text messaging your love one and the bad thing is that because she's in space a message takes from 1 to 8 years to get to someone.

Her being in a space army was a great opportunity to show how she makes new friends in the  army but the army is just a bunch of other ships with people in them like her. There is a big home ship but who knows what the heck is in there but they don't tell you about that. I'm one f those people where I can understand deep movies but maybe voices of a distant star is just too deep and I can't see the beauty shinkai is trying to show.

Maybe he did think of all the things viewers like me and my friends are wanting to know more about but he wanted to put out something different and unique. It seems like someone got lazy and turned something that could of been a masterpiece into an episode of a series.  This is definitely a 5 star story but a 3 star movie.",1130112000,,1718,3.9681159420289855
1844929,5,B00008G8QC,"First, this anime is smart. Second, it has a touching love story. Third, it was animated with obvious love and conviction by one man. That, to me, was enough to pick this film up.

When you sit down to watch it, you'll notice an unconventional style to it. Don't be alarmed by this, as it was indepentantly created by Makoto Shinkai, and it was clear that he was doing this on his own from the start. While watching, your apprehensions should fade as the story starts to seep into you, and eventually, no matter how hard you try, it will all look strange because you'll be looking at the screen through tears. This is as good a love story as there is, and it tells its story in a very unique way, across the stars where time doesn't exactly flow the way it does on Earth. When, as you watch, you realize just what is happening to the main characters, a sense of alarm and loss should come over you. Imagine, getting a text message a year after it was written because of the distance between the two phones. What would you say in the space allowed that was worth travelling for such a long time. This anime poses and answers those question in a wonderful way. I recommend this highly.

And, as a bonus, there's a short film about a cat who watches the slow depression of its master and attempts to puzzle out the reasons behind her mood. Also worth watching.",1129680000,,1357,4.359683794466403
1844976,4,B00008G8QC,"First of all it should be stated that this is a masterpiece. I haven't watched anything so touching since Haibane Renmei. Everything about this absolutely screams quality; from the heartfelt dialog to the well defined characters to the absolutely breathtaking art work. In saying that however, this movie left me with some minor complaints. Nothing too serious, but enough for me to knock off a star. First of all, the sub-titles are terrible. This is no major problem, because the english dubbing is so good. However, i would very much prefer to watch these shows in the original japanese. And since i don't speak the language, i find that good subtitles are very important. Also, the 'movie' is way too short: the 30 minutes this movie runs for (probably less if you don't count the ending credits) is nowhere near as much time as this film deserves. It comes across feeling like the pilot episode for a much longer series and left me feeling a little bit ripped off. All that said though, this movie is certainly worth the watch. If you ever get a chance to see it, please do. You certainly won't regret it. Beautiful work, Makoto. :-D",1128902400,,1138,4.695
1844977,4,B00008G8QC,"The creator of this anime repeatedly stated that he boldly quitted his job twice during his interview in the extra section on the DVD.  Apart from being very amusing, it did impress me greatly.  He boldly quitted this job twice to fulfill his dream to make this anime.  This anime is obviously a labor of love and it showed.

Unfortunately, I cannot give it 5 stars.  It was good but not that good.

The story is simple.  It seeks to answer the question ""Can love transcend distance and time?""  The answer seemed trite.  So how does focusing on ""I am here"" going to help anything?  The story did touch me greatly, in part due to the excellent voice acting of Cynthia Martinez.  You can feel the two lovers been torn apart by war.  I suppose these days there are no shortage of real life examples.

The animation was good but not spectacular.  Of course if you take into consideration that it was basically the work of only one person, you will be tremendously impressed.

The voice acting was great.  I wish Cynthia Martinez had more exposure these days.  I just love her girlish little voice.  Wow!

The short in the extra section ""She and Her Cat"" was actually better than the main feature.  It was whimsical and sweet.  It showed the infatuation of a cat for his owner.  I loved it.

The interview of the director was a gem.  ""So I boldly quit my job!"" he exclaimed.  Not once, but twice!  I love it!",1127347200,,1403,4.425196850393701

1844979,4,B00008G8QC,"A coworker, knowing me being a big fan of Miyazaki, recommended this one. I was very very impressed by it. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that I think Mr. Shinkai has so much potential so I am reserving the 5 stars for his future films.
As others have pointed out, it is significant that a high quality product, though short, CAN be made by one person. We are lost in a world believing that only big corporations with big funding can make good things. Producers and audience should be ashamed by all the craps churned out by Hollywood and Disney every year at costs the size of the GDP of a midsize country! It feels like a cool breeze in a summer night watching this 30 minute gem.
I guess only an old culture, or people from an old culture, can appreciate the idea that people would wait for 8 years to receive a letter from loved ones. In a world where fast food and quick bucks are expected, people simply don't have patience or the sense of the dimension of ""time"". It is funny that though our technologies are able to shrink three spatial dimensions by moving us faster and faster, there is very little we can  do with time. The scifi writers try to get around it by first inventing wrap drive, then warm holes (from Star Trek to DSP9) so everything become present and instataneous and everything can be covered in one hour, minus commercials. I think that's why the idea of this film is so refreshing.
The concepts about space and time in the film are pretty correct in physics sense (warp jump is still pushing a bit far, no matter what).
The school girl uniform for a space fighter is a bit odd at first, but it adds the dreaming quality in the whole thing, I think,
I notice that Shinkai, being a younger anime artist, is not the greatest at portraying human movement or animals. The perception and light arrangement in his drawings of scenery and still objects are top notch, which is almost expected nowadays with all the computer programs. I look forward to seeing how he develop his style in animating human and animals, which Studio Ghibli is still the king!
As I tried to say in the title, this film is a mix of Japanese poetry or sense of time/history and relativity. Most people in this country don't care for real science or history so very few people get it, let alone be able to produce things like this...",1125100800,,2333,4.400462962962963

The main individuals in this story include a rather inept, overly emotional 15 year old girl piloting a mech and some stereotypical high school male heartthrob. Apparently the military in this flick will trust anyone with a mech, eh? They must grow on trees.

As to the ""tragedy"" at the heart of this movie (not a spoiler), it involves nothing more than the loss of a potential lover--not even an actual lover.  Heck, if that's tragic, then every child of US military personnel should make a movie, considering they move across the US/world every 3-4 years.",1117411200,,703,4.737704918032787

1844983,5,B00008G8QC,"""Voices of a Distant Star"" is not only one of the best animes I've ever seen, but one of the best movies as well.  It only includes two characters, who's love and determination to keep their relationship going dispite the growing distance and time in between them makes the movie great.  It is best classified as a thoughtful romantic film of the highest rating, for those who want to watch a deeply moving movie.  The subtleties in it are what allow it to be so short while still telling the full story.  In fact, much of the story is told by the text messages they send each other, by the music, and by their expressions.

The story starts with both of them graduating junior high.  The girl is selected to go in space to fight an ellusive alien lifeform, while the boy goes through high school.  As the distance gets further between her ship and Earth, the text messages she sends take longer to get back to Earth.  The boy decides that no matter how long the messages take, he will wait for them, and the girl clings to the hope of being able to see him again and of her messages getting through.

1844984,1,B00008G8QC,"I think a lot of people get worked up about Voices of a Distant star because it was done by one person and because of the sound track. While both of those things are impressive, the plot, dialogue, and characters are not. One is almost forced to wonder why the two ""star crossed lovers"" bother keeping up their correspondence. By the end of this movie, they seem to have about as much of an emotional connection between them as I have with they guy who bags my groceries. Maybe less.

Considering the length of this anime, it has a disproportionate amount of still shots. There's no climax or resolution. Because of the length and the lack of an ending, I actually thought I had read the box wrong and picked up the first episode of a longer series and not a movie.

I normally love sad anime, but I would say Voices of a Distant Star is a force watch only.",1113004800,2,857,4.316770186335404
1845015,5,B00008G8QC,"""A love story that transcends time and space...""  That is what was written on the back of the DVD cover - and that I must say is probably the best summary one can give about this hauntingly beautiful tale of love and loss.

It is set in a near-future world...  It is the story of two young lovers, with their whole lives ahead of them, with seemingly endless possibilities.  But their lives were torned apart by a war with a mysterious alien race, and one leaves the earth to fight as mecha pilot.  The only thing connecting them are a series of text messages, sent from space via a mobile phone.

I cannot reveal anymore about the story without giving too much away, since the film is a very short and basic one, with very little plot or character development, and clocking in at just 30 minutes.  But do NOT be put off by this.  This film is pure poetry, with smooth beautiful animation, an amazing artistic style, a haunting soundtrack - and a bittersweet, timeless story, that once experienced, would stay with you for the rest of your life.

But be warned - dispite the mecha, the aliens, and the sci-fi setting, this is purely a tale of romance.  If you are space battles and action, or even sex and violence, then this is not for you.",1106697600,5,1241,4.4035087719298245

1845017,4,B00008G8QC,"Quite a good DVD. I had to watch it a couple of times to fully appreciate it. It has a great story with good animation.

It brings to mind the questions of love and time travel. As Mikako travels to speeds close to the speed of light, she ages far less slower than her boyfriend Noboru as he is home on earth. Their love not only has to endure the effects of time travel but also the distances between them. The further she goes into space, the longer it takes for messages to be sent between them.

The animation was good too. The only flaw would be the frame rate, as some parts were quite choppy, but it doesnt dampen the experience.

That Makoto Shinkai was able to weave a powerful and moving story into LESS THAN 30 MINUTES is the work of no less than a master storyteller. The visuals are among the best in the business. Shinkai's use of light and color is mesmerizing.  Miyazaki would be proud of him, perhaps even jealous.  Combine the look with a spare and melancholy score by Tenmon and emotions cascade from the screen.  This story begs to be series or a full-length picture.  I hope this gifted man is hard at work on continuing the themes that he has so skillfully put forward.  Please do not let the shortness of the picture deter you.

To the director of this film: i personlly think that u are a talented man not only to create this anime on your own, but how all your the ideas were brought by yourself and put togther without other people's opininons.

Now with the story, its pretty good and that there is a meaning to all this crap that happens to the to people that had a relationship.  The main meaning of this film is that Love is strong no matter wut can get in the way and no matter how far apart the relationship is.  The whole idea of this film is that LOVE is the strongest thing the mankind has to survive, inorder to live, LOVE is the one thing that keeps a person alive and it takes more than a distant relationship to break the strength of love.

By the way, the action scenes were pretty cool and the animation realistic, kinda better than evangalion, but evangalion is a better anime overall. the action scenes are all computer animated and its not that entertaining, but its satisfying.  Overall this dvd is worth buying to many anime lovers, its part of a collection that one should buy and keep.",1101945600,,1264,4.2899159663865545
1845020,5,B00008G8QC,"5 stars but...

 To begin with I would like to say that it is nearly unbelievable the fact that only one man did all this; excellent work. As for the ""design"" and so on, it was very good. The story was very touching. However, there are people out there who believe that the story has flows etc. My opinion is that it focused on character development and that it made me a little bit sad.

Main story message: ""No matter what happens, real love never dies"".

 What follows refer to the ending. If you would like to watch the anime but don't like to know the ending than don't read it...

 The but refers to: a) That the ending was somehow abrupt, b) The ending was not so clear. On the one hand you get the impression that the boy joins the armada and therefore they will meet again somewhere out in space or that the girl was left alone out in space (maybe the main fleet was destroyed in the last combat as well as the arms of her robot and she will be lost in space or maybe die? Or maybe, I am way too confused with the ending) and the boy will search to find her? C) the anime was too short. Although the creator managed to fit successfully everything in 30 minutes I would love to see more of it, or if they would manage to create more series out of this anime this would be great.

What's important is the vast glowing cloud of melancholy that emanates from this film. It's not despair... but it's not hope, either. It just is what it is. (The short about the girl and her cat -- told from the cat's point of view -- has the same magical quality.)

1845022,5,B00008G8QC,"For those who say this is eye candy - well, they're absolutely right, but to say it's just that - well, they couldn't be more wrong. ""Voices of a Distant Star"" is a short 30 minute animation by Makoto Shinkai that uses both 3D and traditional drawings. And while the graphics are visually stunning with otherworldly effects that will keep you captivated, it's the story that did it for me. Although I do wish this film had been longer to give us viewers more insight on the depth and history of their friendship/relationship, quality rules over quantity here and you can't help but feel the strong connection they have for one another right from the start...

Nuboro and Mikako had hopes of attending the same high school together but when a strange alien force threatens the human race, Mikako gives in to her fascinations with the sky above and decides to become a pilot for the UN Forces to help save mankind. But in doing so she was forced to leave behind the one person she cared about more than anything: Nuboro. Their only means of communicating is through text messaging but the further Mikako goes out to space, the longer the messages take to reach him (1 month, 1 year, 8 years...) as he grows older and she remains young.

There's of course a sprinkle of battle scenes here and there with sci-fi imagery but ""Voices of a Distant Star"" mostly relies on emotional impacts to keep one entranced and Makoto has done that with misty-eyed perfection. In short, this is a breathtaking anime about one couple's heart-wrenching struggles and how they deal with being apart. It shows that no matter the distance, true love can withstand the test of time, despite how difficult it may be.

1845065,1,B00008G8QC,"The only reason this dvd shouldn't be panned completely, is because of the shorter short film.  While not exactly the most interesting piece of anime ever created, it is honest enough in it's depiction of a human's ideas on a cat's method of thinking (?) that it deserves viewing.  As for the title short film, well, about the only thing that I can say to it's benefit is that it moves along at a deliberate enough pace so as not to really break stride.  And that's not much of a compliment.
I picked this dvd up for $20 canadian.  I was foolish enough to not check the length before purchasing it.  While some reviewers might take solace in the fact that it is comparable to other truly groundbreaking pieces of science-fiction, I find that to be a detriment.  The theory is based upon Einsteins' theory.  It does resemble the works of Orson Scott Card (Speaker for the Dead), and Joe Haldeman (The Forever War).  The aliens that Noboru fights against are almost identical to the lesser shadow vessels from Babylon 5.  Each of these aforementioned titles are all Hugo award winners.  When a story can attribute so much of it's substance to other sources, it no longer becomes relevant.  It is simply derivitive.

Granted, he used to work for a video game software company, so he already had a significant amount of professional experience in this field.
His interview in the extras section is required viewing. His quiet naturalness is in stark contrast to his audacity in even attempting something like this. He also has some very thoughtful things to say about the possibility of making animation into a more ""personal"" medium of artistic expression.
The emotional content in ""Voices from a Distant Start"" was without the typical melodrama and had a ring of truth to it. In that sense, it managed to escape the limitations of robot-SF anime. I found the love story to be genuinely touching. However, there were some anime conventions that he held on to that he really should have discarded. The two protagonists should have been older, and the fact that the girl was wearing her school uniform while operating her robot was ludicrous. With a few changes, it could have been a 5-star work.

Believing in love and connections throughout time and space is as essential as belief in myself, that I can achieve whatever I put my heart to, and in all things Good.  o8E  I'm feeling thankful for the precious friends that love me, and I'm most thankful for WindBeneathHer (MY) Wings tonight because soaring isn't possible without the Wind and he is that for me o8E. Love is forever. I wish everyone reading this joy, inspiration, and renewed strength mounting up with wings as the  eagle.  Soar! Yeah, you. ~_^  o8E",1077235200,7,1132,4.61

1845106,5,B00008G8QC,"This is the first anime that has left me actually feeling something after it is over; for once it had a little more to it than awesome action, cool characters, and a descent story.  When ""Voices"" ended I immediately watched it again, hoping, like a small child, that the second time around that something would change and take away that painful void left when everything was done; but alas, everything stayed as it should.  In a word, unbelievable, ""Voices of a Distant Star"" is a must see for everyone who appreciates good anime.",1073865600,,530,4.688172043010753
1845107,4,B00008G8QC,"When this began I was skeptical; the animation wasn't too terrific and the dialogue seemed simplistic.
What a difference 15 minutes makes.
For some reason you find yourself gaining empathy for both of the characters, who are realistic, kind, and strong. The more they exchange words across their phones and the time between each message lengthens, the more you want them to be together. They are children, and at the same time, adults. I'm not sure that I would recommend this short film for a single feeling, but that feeling...I'm not even sure what it was. Almost bittersweet, not quite melancholy, close to comfort. What I think it may have been was passion for the human race--their strength when inspired by love.
I'd say to rent it first but, if you can't, then you may want to spend a few dollars for some newfound hope.",1073174400,3,828,4.7172413793103445
1845108,4,B00008G8QC,"I first picked this title up in a video store becuase of the great art on the DVD box.  I am a shameless Japanese animation fan, so I would have probably taken it home to view anyway.  Still, the art was fantastic.
When I got home and started viewing, I was not only amazed at the quality of the art but how fast I was drawn into the story; you get bits and scraps of the plot here and there in a manner that keeps you wondering what the whole thing is leading up to.  In the end, this is a love story.  But, there are enough mecha images and beautiful weaponry to fascinate anyone.  They serve to tell a story though and are not meant to be the central theme of the movie.
My only disappointment is the fact the DVD's main feature is 25 minutes in length.  I know this is still a herculean task for the movie's sole artist, but I wanted more.  In fact, the whole thing ends rather suddenly.  You are left to wonder the final outcome of the story.  I guess it is a sad ending, for the transit times involved in this title mean the two main characters are likely never to see each other again.
The video was produced digitally and, of course, transfers flawlessly to DVD.  The music was quite nice.  I wish I had the score on MP3.
I hope this title inspires other, one-person studios to extend the medium and come out with feature-length films.  The tools are now in a lot of very talented peoples' hands.
Good DVD.  I recommend it.",1069545600,,1431,4.197802197802198
1845109,1,B00008G8QC,While the Animation is visually rich and the basic concept of lovers separated by the realities of Spaceflight are a good start they have not been used effectively. What there is of a plot is told rather than shown. Despite the characters occasional claims to the contrary there is no real character development. In all this made for a rather dull 30 minuets of viewing.,1068508800,3,370,4.707692307692308
1845110,5,B00008G8QC,"Comming from a single artist with nothing more than basically a Power Mac as a workstation this is quite an excellent piece of work.  I admit that it is centered around love and drives the characters throughout the show.  Seeing past that it shows the hardships of war and how fragile the human race really is.  I don't believe some of the events could occur in that day and age but I'm not here to pick on things that may be the future.  The ending is rather sad but shows the cruel reality of life for the two main characters.  I think this anime would have to be catagorized as an element of its own, very unique!  About the time of the movie, It is short but I think its for the best that you don't get too attached to the characters.",1068422400,,738,4.161971830985915
1845173,2,B00008G8QC,"This is a 30-minute work made by a single artist. The story is somewhat reminiscent of Haldeman's classic SF novel ""The Forever War."" The artwork is variable... the characters themselves tend to be poorly rendered and at times almost grotesque. On the other hand the imagery of the fighting mechs are very well done and fascinating. The story itself is reasonably satisfying although very angst-filled.
The DVD also includes some very interesting extra material including an interview with the artist and one of his earlier works which is quite good. Overall you won't get much for your money. But if you are an artist interested in seeing what can be done by a single person with passion and drive this is as good an example as there is.",1067817600,2,738,4.7734375
1845174,5,B00008G8QC,"I would give it less stars if I looked at this DVD and was disappointed by it's short lenght, which is about 30 mins. It's not a big epic story anime with great character development or that much of any plot or action at all. I am only looking at the film for what it is. It's a short indy anime film with gorgeous art work and sheer poetic expressions of the creator. The film was almost all entirely done by one person. ""Voices of a Distant Star"" and it's DVD extra called ""She and her Cat"" are two beautiful stories of unconditional love that transcends beyond the loneliness of time, space and even words. Definitely touching and worthwhile to own.",1065139200,5,652,4.396694214876033
1845175,5,B00008G8QC,"I bought this DVD a couple days ago, not expecting much, but boy, was I surprised. This has to be one of the best animated film-things I have ever seen. It had a great plot, animation was decent, and the music fit it perfectly.
  So....What is it about, exactly? Well, there are two teenagers in love, though they haven't admitted it yet. The girl, Mikako, is chosen to be in the U.N Army. She has to leave Noboru and go out to space, but she  him e-mails a lot. The distance between the two grows larger, up to the point where it takes 8.6 years for a single e-mail to get back to Earth.

1845176,5,B00008G8QC,"I get upset when I read reviews of Voices of A Distant Star that whine about it being too short. 30 minutes is an eternity in terms of animation and it boggles my mind that Voices was made by a lone animator. Makoto Shinkai has created the animated equivalent of a one-act play or a novella, which will emotionally affect its audience for much longer than the duration of the work itself. The story is simple, poetic, and heart-wrenching. In 30 short minutes, Shinkai depicts a lifetime of emotion and I consider the film's brevity to be one of its greatest assets (Hollywood could learn a few lessons in this regard).",1062028800,3,618,4.576576576576577
1845177,5,B00008G8QC,"""Voices of a Distant Star"" won several short anime awards not only in Japan, but in Toronto as well. The unedited directors cut of the short is approximately 30 minutes long, however the DVD also offers another one of Makoto Shinkai short films from 1997, ""She and Her Cat"", a pleasurable 5 minute short from the perspective of a cat and his love for his mistress.
""Voices"" focuses on two young ""lovers"" who are split apart by Mikako's decision to become a mecha pilot to help defeat a strange alien race that had annihilated several Martian cities. As the distance between Mikako and Noboru grow, so too does their need for each other. Mikako has only her memories of Noboru to live through from trip to trip, fight from fight, but text messages Noboru as much as she can. Noboru has the text messages to look forward to day in year out. This frustrated love between Noboru and Mikako shivers with regret on both sides. As each day passes, Noboru tries to move on from his unrequited love Mikako, believing that she will never come back, not in this time, and not for him. Mikako lives day to day, eventually regretting her having ever left Noboru's side for something so trivial and self-satisfying.
The strained relationship between Noboru and Mikako, growing ever distant can leave an empty void in ones belly. The key emotions of the movie are played up so well within the short, that one cannot help but feel the pain of a lost but not forgotten love. Makoto Shinkai elaborates on the distilled love very well, a very emotional film.
 I suggest ""Voices"" for the one who is looking for an impressive 3-D CG graphic anime that focuses on re-inventing direction with characters on a more personal and tragic view. This is a work meant to toy with new filming ideas, and Shinkai has managed to improve tension and bleed regret from animated characters in a stylistic enviroment that is picture perfect. Many ideas are explored in this film, and it is worth any enjoyer of anime's time and money.",1061510400,4,1997,4.657223796033994
1845178,4,B00008G8QC,"It is short, though that's no crime.  Blood The Last Vampire was pretty short as well and was quite an awesome movie.  I rather liked it, but that's my opinion.
Way back when... being on the other end of the world was a world away... often times correspondances took days, weeks, months to reach their destination.  In the modern world, talking with someone on the other side of the world is but about 20 digits on a touchtone phone, a mere double click in an AIM window, an Email Send-button click away.  So being literally a world apart is nothing for todays technology... would that be so if you were trying to have a long distance relationship with someone who lived on, oh say... Pluto?  Well this movie explores that idea of old in a time of hyperspace travel, internet, cellphone email and other wonders... this movie rediscovers that feeling of distance that no longer exists for just about everyone.
The first part of the movie introduces the two lovers and gives you a look at to what their life was like on earth.  Watching both, the english and the japanese offers, in a lot of places, a different view of the two (being geared towards the culture that spoke the recorded langugaes).  The rest of the story is basically an exchange of messages between the two of them.  At first the messages take a while, a day or two to reach him.  Then her messages start to take months, as the fleet moves farther away.  The farther it moves, the longer the messages take.  So while her messages are traveling to him, he's living, moving on.  And then he recieves her messages after what seems like forever... messages sent from when she was younger that are just now reaching him.  The small film puts emphasis on her pain and his emptiness and on both of their survivals.
The DVD also comes packaged with a short called Her and her Cat.  It's a cute short film about a girl that lives alone with her cat and is all from the Cat's point of view.  I suggest watching the 5 minute version and practising on your speed reading before hand, it's all subtitled and it moves fast.
It's a short film, nothing grand and drawn out... no completely breathtaking story.  It's a short that presents a philosophical message, the old time delima of space and distance that is no longer felt as much anymore.  The opening presents the line ""[I was always a phone call away]"".  I like it in my anime library because it is short.  When I have a craving to watch a film I can get in Voices, Ghost in the Shell, Spirited Away and Grave of Fireflies in.  A good chunk of anime instead of 8 episodes in a tv series.
It's a nice artpiece.",1061251200,2,2616,4.433054393305439
1845179,3,B00008G8QC,"If you're deciding wether to buy this movie or not.  DO NOT!!!!  OH MY GOD!!!! This is pathetic and sad.  Its a copy of Gunbuster, minus character development, background storylines, in exchange for good animation and a story thats echo'd, well I should say stolen from Anime, all across the spectrum.  I personally would have enjoyed a revamp'd version of Gunbuster had it been longer than 30 FREAKING MINUTES.  It wsant even worth the 4$ I paid to rent it.
Scenes that were similar to Gunbuster.
The Starship Laser Firing sequence
The Lone mecha against the single enemy capital ship.
The Shields of the ""Tracer"" and the mech from Gunbuster.
The design shape of the aliens.
The scene of some sort of reactor looks exactly like the Gunbuster Warp generator
The way the ships warped
The way the mecha launched
The organic appearance of the aliens
The shape of the capital ships",1061078400,2,877,4.743421052631579
1845180,5,B00008G8QC,"I happened to come across a review of this short film in many of the Anime Magizines I read.  My first thought was that it couldn't be that good, it's only 30 minutes, however, since the review priased it very highly, I decided to fork out 10 bucks to buy it.  This short story is like no other anime I have seen yet, it takes what could be a 10 - 20 episode series and compresses it into a 30 minute short film.  Though all the character development is absent, this Voices of a Distant Star is a great concept.  Someone had mentioned that Makoto Shinkai, was great in the way he tells short sories, now I can see first hand just how good he truly is!! I would love to see more of his works, it would also be interesting to see what this new comer to the world of anime can do with a full 10 - 20 episode series.

I was amazed.
Yet only for a minute since by then I was drawn into one of the most tragic love stories I had ever seen... by the time it ended I felt tears in my eyes.

1845182,5,B00008G8QC,"If you were ever looking for an anime that could be used as an introduction to the world of Japanese animation, look no further than Voices of a Distant Star.
I will not give away too much of the story other than the basic plot of the movie. First off, if you are looking or a big mech fighting melee, look somewhere else. Not to say that there isn't any of that, it is primarily a love story about two people torn apart by war. This film has just the right amount of mech fighting to balance the whole thing out.
The story is told entirely through the two main characters, one from the soldier traveling light years through space, and one from the man that she left behind back on earth.
Now, enough of the story, now onto the details of the film:
The DVD Menus:
This is one of the cleanest DVDs I've seen in a while, no excess junk on any of the menus. I'm a firm believer in the whole ""less is more"" concept, and this DVD adheres wonderfully to that. From the minute I put the disc in, I found my self hunting through the menus so I could listen to the music clips that were on each one.
The Music:
From the music on the title screen, you will be hooked on the perfectly fitting piano score selected for this story. Throughout the entire film the music changes to help with the emotional direction of the story. Even the battle theme managed to turn a soft piano song into a believable fight song. I found myself scouring the internet trying to find the music for download.
The animation:
The animation on this DVD is mostly computer generated. The character designs look a little choppy compared to the 3D rendered mechs, buildings, and spacecraft scattered throughout the feature. Still, they don't look out of place at all. A lot of complaints I've seen were about the lack of actual animation and the excessive use of still images. There is still a lot of animation, and the still images in no way take away from the film. In most cases, I believe it just adds to the story, it also gives you time to sit and stare at the awesome use of color. If only the real world looked as nice as this. :)
The voice acting:
This is one of the few Animes where I can honestly say that the English voices are WAY better than the original Japanese tracks. The voice actors hired for this did a top notch job and really brought forth the emotional impact to this film that I felt was missing on the Japanese track. You can truly hear the pain in the voices on the English track. Even though I don't understand any Japanese other than ""hello"", it just seemed to be lacking any emotion.
DVD Extras:
There are quite a few extras on this disc that will keep you from feeling that you wasted [$$] on a 30 minute DVD. There is another feature by the creator called ""She and Her Cat"" and an interview with the creator. Japanese trailers for Voices of a Distant Star, and a few other trailers of other releases from ADV Films.
After watching this DVD once, it has towered over all of my other Anime movies by far. Do not hesitate to add this to your collection.",1058918400,24,3044,4.2956521739130435

If you've seen Shinkai's other work, in essence, you've already seen this one--but it's still worth doing again.  He develops the themes he's explored elsewhere, and focuses on the character relationships so much that all else (including the alien invasion[s]) gets completely neglected.  Ultimately, that's okay, because that's what you wanted with Shinkai in the first place, right?

Make sure that you do NOT, not-not-not, not, NEVER watch it in English.  The voice actors tried their bestest, but they were too painful to listen to.
