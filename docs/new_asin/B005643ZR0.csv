I really enjoyed the film, even though I disliked the main character, as he runs to the very borderline of being court martialed at every turn. War is hell, especially if you are a disrespectful youngster....",1478908800,,284,4.7
8459172,5,B005643ZR0,"This is a well made mini-series re ww2 Soviet troops in 1944 during the war... historical fiction. It mostly involves the lives and loves of a platoon of scouts and their activites vs a vs German troops, an NKVD officer, and local civilians. It is not too heavy on combat footage, so if you are looking for a bloodfest you might find this slow, but it was written more as a montage of all types of activity you might find at the front and at the battalion and regimental headquarters areas to their immediate rear of the front. I recognized some of the actors from other modern Russian films, like 9th Company, for example. Overall, it is a very high quality production and gear and uniforms are as accurate as can be expected... although everyone looks a bit too clean to be at the front ! LOL ! The actors are very good, the plot and script are well written, plenty of intrigue, and the action scenes are good.

If you are looking for even handedness in the portrayal of both sides, forget it. The Germans are either inept key-stone cop types or buffoons... more like props, to show off the happy stalwart virtues of the red army peasant and worker class ... so its totally a pro-Russian point of view. The red army seems to be logical and well groomed and have few real privations in this film, although history shows otherwise. And there is an abscence of atrocities.
So on the one side you get a very entertaining ww2 drama with some laughs and action with visual historical accuracy up to a point, but on the other hand its a pro Russian puff peice, probably made for domestic consumption.
Think ""Combat"" (USA tv show) for Russia, but with more comedy and romance, and less dirt. Overall I give it a thumbs up for entertainment value but don't expect total historical reality. Its a Russian Drama probably meant for their domestic TV.
Reenactors who do ww2 will like the overall uniform, weapon, and vehicle use and accuracy.",1357948800,,1931,4.5488505747126435
