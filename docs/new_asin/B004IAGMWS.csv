8430520,4,B004IAGMWS,"I needed a primer on the subject of European Nymphing and this video did a solid job in providing the information. It also provides a fairly detailed discussion of leader creation and the equipment as well as the actual ""on stream"" video.

Where did this video let me down? Two areas - 1) The section that discussed the fishing of a coiled sighter didn't actually show a coiled sighter being fished. I would have liked to see how that works. 2) there was a portion of the video where the audio was very muted. Apparently some sort of audio malfunction while recording on the stream. They should have reshot that part or dubbed in the audio.",1305072000,2,640,4.517241379310345
