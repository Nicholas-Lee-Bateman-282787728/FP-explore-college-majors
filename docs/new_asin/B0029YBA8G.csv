3882310,5,B0029YBA8G,"There is a statement on the back cover of this DVD that nearly says it all:  ""American Belly Dance Legends. . . .The dance pioneers that started the Belly Dance movement in the United States!  Featuring the Greats in our dance world.  To know your dance history is to know your craft.  A must have for all serious Students of Oriental Dance, Teachers of Raks Sharki, Ethnic Dance Studios and Fans of Belly Dance.""

What I would add to this is that if you are in fact teaching, no matter whether in the US or beyond (as the statement above speaks to American Belly Dance Legends - although many of these dancers have touched and taught students all over the world) this DVD will provide you with one of the best tools of your teacher's tool box.  If you don't purchase this DVD and share its contents with your students I personally feel you would be doing yourself and those students a disservice.  As an Adjunct College Teacher, I am adding this to the curriculum for my class.

I am sad to say that I have heard dancers, students, some who think they have already reached professional status, who when I mention one of our dance legends, tilt their heads and out of their mouth comes ""I've never heard of him/her"".  Could you be in ballet and not know Baryshnikov?  Or any dance and not know Ruth St. Denis?  It makes my head hurt to think that there could even be teachers who don't know some of these legends.  To not know those who came before us, those who paved the way and many who continue to do so, is just a shame.  If not for these legends, these icons we would NOT have such a full and rich dance art in which to participate.

Amaya has given us such a gift in this 90-minute DVD-THANK YOU this is truly an incredible piece of work; performances, conversations, and stylings of some of the greats in our business.  And I am honored to say, that I have studied with, taken workshops with, and/or witnessed performances by all but two of the legends in this DVD.  It gave me chills to realize how lucky, how blessed I am to have had those instructional opportunities and dance experiences.

Amaya does the narration of the entire work.  Her lovely voice is clear and even soothing as you listen to her stories of who, when and where.  She keeps you fascinated all along the way as you experience the performances and excitement they create.  And when offering a trademarked comment by one of them, actually takes on the tone of their voice, superbly.

So all that said, this is one you will want to add to your tool box, share with friends and students, utilize as a teacher, and just purely enjoy every minute.  It will have you shimmying into your next dance class or if you have never taken a belly dance class, will have you signed up in the beat of a zil.

3882311,5,B0029YBA8G,"This DVD is one of my favorites. Maybe because I was brought up in this era where these dancers were so revered by the rest of us. This was an era when people who were really good were looked up to and respected. Where today there are no real stars just a a lot of dancers. A very different time. It is wonderful to look back and remember these people who forged ahead and helped create a business that could be respected and admired. These are the dance pioneers that started the movement here in the US! Featuring the greats in our dance world. To know your dance history and the artists is to know your craft.

This DVD is a must have for all serious students of Oriental Dance, teachers of Raks Sharki, ethnic dance studios and those teaching world dance styles. Also, just plain wonderful for the fan of Belly Dance. A wonderful DVD, well produced by Amaya Productions. There are clips of all the greats from across the country: Adrianna, Aida Al Adawi, Aisha Ali, Aziz, Dahlena, De Ann, Helena Vlahos, Ibrahi,m ""Bobby"" Farrah, JAmila Salimpur, John Compton, Morocco and Roman ""Bert"" Balladine. There are also bonus scenes of Ahmed Jajour of CAnada and Amir of Boston.

My favorites are Helen Vlahos who resides now in Phoenix, AZ and Dahlena who is still teaching and living in Yuma, AZ. Bobby has been gone over 10 years now. He resided in NYC and was the Master of choreography. He was a choreographic genius. There are still many of his students who practice and perform to this day. Amir of Boston is a treat to see. He passed away back in the late 80's at the tender age of 32. A wonderful performer to be enjoyed by all.  Bert Balladine was a favorite for all. He has also passed away. I could go on forever about the wonderful people in this video. Not only were they great performers and entertainers they are/were wonderful people also. Do yourself a favor and get this DVD and add it to your collection. Amaya Productions has outdone itself on producing this for the public. Hope more will follow to help educate our expanding community of dancers to understand what has gone before.",1267574400,8,2099,4.532981530343008
3882312,5,B0029YBA8G,"After answering the poll about 2009 videos, I pulled out my American Belly Dance
Legends to watch again. While I was at Amaya's Wise Woman Retreat in early
2008, she had given us on overview of the project honoring these wonderful
trailblazers of American dance, so I was really excited to see the finished
product when it came out.

Kudos to Amaya for doing such a wonderful job. Amaya fuses her narrative with
breathtaking photos and video, giving us a great overview of these pioneers of
American belly dance. I was introduced to a few dancers that I had only heard
of by name if at all. The video really helped me put many of the puzzle pieces
into place regaring our dance heritage.

Thank you again, Amaya, for the many hours put into this labor of love and for
making the information and footage available to us. I highly recommend it to
anyone interested in learning more about the hisotry of Middle Eastern or belly
dance in America. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that there will be a Volume 2!",1263772800,7,1004,4.541436464088398

8358545,5,B0029YBA8G,"I wish this DVD included full performances, but I'm not even certain such footage is available for some, if not most of these legends.  Thanks to some other reviews, I wasn't disappointed by expecting too much.  This video is still an excellent start in documenting the visual history of oriental/belly/Mid-eastern dance.  I hope Amaya, or another visionary, produces additional video covering other legends.",1427760000,,408,5.444444444444445
8358546,5,B0029YBA8G,"Where do you begin in a field that so many have influenced and worked so hard to bring to the forefront of American culture?  ""American Belly Dance Legends"" is the ""Tip of the Iceberg"" in the history of American Belly Dance.  This dvd is a must have for every belly dancer no matter what style as in the beginning all the styles had a root and this root has flowered to what we have today.  This dvd is the ""Tip of the Iceberg"" as so many more ""Legends"" could be produced.  Hopefully this will happen but this a a must have historical dvd of Belly Dance!",1410652800,,554,4.19811320754717
8358547,4,B0029YBA8G,"I give four stars because I was expecting something more, but this DVD is fantastic for the information is presents and includes footage of the dancers featured. I was very pleased learning about Bellydance in the USA and I found it really enlightening. This is a good and helpful addition to your Bellydance library. :)",1380931200,,320,4.836363636363636
8358548,4,B0029YBA8G,"This is a very good attempt at getting a history of the beginnings of American belly dance available.  It lacks a few participants, but the main lack is of video clips of the earlier dancing of the principals.  I'd like to have seen some of Morocco's earlier dancing, for instance.  Bobby Farrah was notorious for not allowing his dancing to be filmed, and I am sad that he has thus deprived new generations of dancers and musicians of his expertise.  His dance style was very different from the styles of John Compton and Bert Balladine. I would characterize Bobby's dancing, perhaps, as very dignified, and yet glorious in it's near-understatement. Be that as it may, this video is well-worth having, and sharing.

8358549,3,B0029YBA8G,"I had thought there would be a performance from each featured dancer, and was disappointed because there are only short clips of actual dances. But I really like knowing stuff about this dance from, so the history and information about these amazing artists is great to have. There are portions of interviews, dance clips, and biographical information about the individual artists, as well as tidbits of dance history.",1370908800,2,418,5.161764705882353
8358550,5,B0029YBA8G,"If you are a serious American belly dancer, your dance library would not be complete without this. Production values are low in some places, but considering the fact that the footage is old and rare, it's great to have anything available at all. I was very nostalgic watching this video. I miss a lot of these people and am grateful for their contributions to the dance. I am more grateful that such a video exists so that they can be shared with the world. We've come a long way from this simple beauty, but it's a time worth acknowledging and knowing about. American Bellydance Legends is a great DVD.",1319414400,3,603,4.541284403669724
8358551,5,B0029YBA8G,"This production is a true labor of love! I know the work that went into this DVD.
Thank you Amaya! For me, it is a beautiful dance down memory lane. I know/knew almost everyone featured. Their dancing was pure art straight from the heart and soul. Everyone in this dance today must own a copy; it will change your dance forever! I purchased several copies to give as gifts.",1284422400,,373,4.420289855072464
8358552,5,B0029YBA8G,Can't add much more to what's already been so well said.  This is a must have for anyone who is a serious student or connoisseur of bellydance.  Well done.,1277942400,2,155,4.310344827586207
8358553,5,B0029YBA8G,"I've been belly dancing since 1986, so I've been a student and friend of several of the dancers on this DVD. I was especially delighted to see Aziz, he's one of my all-time favorite dance teachers----it was a joy to study with him, and since he's retired, the dance community has missed him. So I felt like I was sitting down with an old friend & catching up on what he's been doing when I watched this DVD. Amaya does an outstanding job on the narration of the DVD, she is also a wonderful dance instructor. I feel that it is very important that the recent generations of dancers know about the previous generations, and this DVD helps fill that gap.

Every belly dancer should be familiar with the work of Ibrahim ""Bobby"" Farrah, Jamila Salimpour, and Bert Balladine---these dancers helped shape generations of dancers and have been very influential with the development of our art. So many other classic dancers are seen on this DVD----all famous names from generations ago, and some are still teaching today. Some of them, like Amir of Boston, are no longer with us, and are missed. One of my early dance instructors in the 1980's was a great friend of Amir and raved about his wonderful dancing. I never got to see him in person, but now I can say I've seen him on DVD. I call this DVD ""required reading"" for serious belly dancers of the new generation.",1272931200,4,1358,4.542857142857143
