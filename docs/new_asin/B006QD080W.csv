5013402,4,B006QD080W,"Got this for my mother, since our Pastor showed it to us during Bible Study.  This is just a great movie to have for both believers and non-believers - Real deal..",1357257600,,163,4.258064516129032
5013403,3,B006QD080W,"IT WAS OKAY SOME PART WAS VERY DEEP. IT MAKE YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR LIFE, AND GETTING IT TOGETHER WITH THE LORD.",1355875200,,110,4.045454545454546
5013404,5,B006QD080W,"I heard about this movie by surfing for something to use for a Sunday school project. Also, someone at my church mentioned the trailer was on the internet. After watching the trailer that is was sparked my interest to order the DVD.  The message through out the film is to make sure you are ready when Christ comes to gather the ""church"". Having a lot of money, certain positions, titles,  and being a good person will not guarantee a place in the kingdom of God.  I have used this film as a tool to evangelize to family & friends. This is a must see and makes you think what if today was the day.",1355356800,2,597,4.219298245614035
5013405,4,B006QD080W,"Great message for non-believers.  Really gets your attention.  The acting wasn't the best but they did a good job. The message/content is what is key.  It does not replace the bible by no means but was a good depiction of what is to come.  After the Rapture, non-believers will still have a chance to be saved but at a cost.",1353888000,,324,4.35
5013406,5,B006QD080W,"OMG - No time to play church (not that we should ever) and tomorrow isn't promised to anyone.  This is the ""BEST"" Rapture movie I have ever seen and I have seen quite a few such as ""A THIEF IN THE NIGHT"", ""LEFT BEHIND"" and all the others and this one.  There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth when some find out they have been left behind after ""knowing"" the truth and they blatantly reject Christ.

The one thing I will say, is that although some will be left behind to go through the tribulation period, this might be slightly better than dying and lifting up their eyes in hell; not the best of conditions but at least they can change their decision and accept Christ.

At the end of the movie, I was speaking in tongues and worshiping God; The movie is a reality check for anyone who ""might"" be playing or hesitating.  From the pulpit to the pews...  A must see....

5013407,5,B006QD080W,"We used this great movie as a teaching tool in our bible study on Wed. We paused the movie after each scene; allowed comments from our congregation and used scriptures to validate the different scenes. The movie touched home for a lot of us and really propelled us to do a deeper study in the word, as well as develop a greater personal relationship with God. Therefore, we will be ready when Christ returns. This movie reminds us of : Matthew 7:21-23 King James Version (KJV)
 21 Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.

Blessings to the producer and entire cast,
Pastor/ Moderator M. Cotton & Leading Lady of Florida",1328054400,2,724,4.4772727272727275
5013408,5,B006QD080W,"Beyond my thoughts that I feel strongly this is a great movie, its crazy to hear how others respond when they see it.  There comedy, Bible-based teachings, various types of characters that most can related to and a few surprises along the way.  Great variety.  It has motivated some to go to church, others to invite more to watch because can be life changing and there are more stories.  Most churches don't preach or teach on the subject of the rapture and how life will be.  No matter what your faith or denomination, I encourage everyone to check this movie out.",1325894400,6,566,4.564356435643564
5013409,5,B006QD080W,If you want a movie that will spark  a conversation with everyone then I would HIGH recommend watching this movie. Not just for older people but young people too.,1444608000,2,162,4.586206896551724
5013410,1,B006QD080W,"If you watch the preview, you basically saw the whole movie. I was really looking forward to getting this, already knowing most ""Christian"" movies are bunk. Not even a movie but a bunch of short stories showcasing false Christians and ""Tiny"" preaching about Jehovah wearing a Hebrew ""666"" on his shirt. More like a sales advertisement to get people to go to a church. You do not need to go to a church building to have a relationship with the LORD. It's not even Biblical",1438128000,,471,4.552941176470588

5013414,1,B006QD080W,Very disappointed,1412553600,,17,8.0
5013415,5,B006QD080W,Its a very good and different view of the rapture that I found very good and refreshing. We actually showed it to the Teen Ministry for a lock-in and got a great response for salvation because of it. Corny acting per usual with most Christian movies but great story line and view point.,1410393600,,286,4.415094339622642
5013416,3,B006QD080W,Well honesty this was an okay movie. I expected way more. It gives a good message at the end but it was mostly about how people act and why they don't make it. It was alright,1403308800,,174,3.861111111111111
5013417,4,B006QD080W,Good movie for inner city churches. The acting was more of a stage acting than for movie acting slightly over acting but the movie has a good point. That point is get ready because Jesus is coming. otherwise great message that a lot of churches need to teach to prepare their churches for the coming of the Lord.,1397088000,,312,4.396551724137931
5013418,2,B006QD080W,Disliked the negativity as it pertains to The Rapture.  The film left you feeling that God is unmerciful and does not love his people and will allow only destruction to prevail upon the world.,1393286400,,192,4.647058823529412
5013419,3,B006QD080W,"The movie was ok, I just wish that it was more eventful and more action packed. The movie focused on ""going to church"" instead of a relationship with Christ. but overall I would show it to Christians and the like to get the point across that Jesus is Coming back.!!!!!!",1388966400,,269,4.4
5013420,5,B006QD080W,Because this is real and everyone should know that Jesus will return one day he is on his way back. I recommend all to see this dvd.,1388534400,,132,3.925925925925926
5013421,5,B006QD080W,"This movie was outstanding. With the faith of GOD, this movie was right on time. Such a really good eye opener",1387411200,,110,4.285714285714286
5013422,5,B006QD080W,"Awesome witnessing movie about the rapture, Jesus really is coming don't get left behind I recommend this movie to my students.",1385942400,,127,5.095238095238095
5013423,2,B006QD080W,The hype and trailers were better than the movie. I was expecting more like left behind series. The sound of the trumpet was Great.,1381190400,,131,4.5
5013424,5,B006QD080W,"I saw the preview of this movie on YouTube and was immediately intrigued. I had seen movies like ""A Thief in the Night,"" and those that followed it, but had never seen one of this caliber before. The acting was Hollywood-esque, the storyline captivating, and overall production was top notch. Additionally, if I had not already been a Christian, this would've pushed me over the edge into becoming one. The movie focuses on what would happen if Jesus came back to receive his church on a Sunday morning, and involves several people that you figured would've known better to make sure that they were ready. If you like end-of-the-world drama that is subtle, yet substantial, this one is for you!!",1379980800,,695,4.8
5013425,4,B006QD080W,"I recommend this movie for all Christians  and non believers. The story line is like todays society . We think we can act this way and do that and not give God what is owed and there aren't consequences but we are accountable . As the preacher says you must be born again.  I have watched other end time movies but this one is better.  If you are looking for the magic scene when Jesus comes  like in left behind series  you won't find it  because the truth is we just don't know but when he does people from all over the world people  will simply vanish and all that will be left is their belongings and  chaos , and devastation .",1379116800,5,631,4.114754098360656
5013426,3,B006QD080W,"This Rapture movie was to short and should of did up to Christ's precoming, don;t waist your time with this lazy job watch other rapture movies on youtube.

I want my $17.00 back",1367452800,,178,4.393939393939394
5013427,3,B006QD080W,"I listen to the radio and all the hype about this movie, and order it because I love Christian faith base movies. This movie could have been better in many ways. The message of the film was ok for someone who are familiar with The word of God. I really didn't enjoy this film.",1365465600,,276,4.12962962962963
5013428,4,B006QD080W,"More a discussion piece to invoke conversation, great for study aide for a group setting. I thought it was a movie, well it is, but its not.",1360627200,,140,4.222222222222222
8502985,5,B006QD080W,My movie came on time and I enjoyed watching it.,1504915200,,48,3.9
8502986,3,B006QD080W,Over priced.  Bought one at a screening of the film about 5 years ago for less then $20 dollars.,1495843200,,96,4.052631578947368
8502987,5,B006QD080W,"The best rapture movie that I have ever seen! We've shown this movie at least three times at different church functions and once at our Juvenile center, which was a great success. The ""real-ness"" of it far exceeds any of the current Hollywood movies out there. Great job!",1485561600,3,271,4.666666666666667

8502992,5,B006QD080W,"I only wish I'd seen this movie sooner - but as the saying goes ""better late than never"".  It has created a life changing experience for me in that although I am a devout Christian and a religious person I see where I can do better and want to change.  I want to be ready when God comes again, watching this movie has really reinforced that.  The movie really helps you to see why it is necessary we stay on track and in faith.  I highly recommend it, it is a must see.",1451692800,,469,4.010752688172043
