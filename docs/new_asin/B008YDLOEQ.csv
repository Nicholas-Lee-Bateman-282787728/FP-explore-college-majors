8532495,4,B008YDLOEQ,"RELEASED TO TV in early 2013 and directed by Zach Lipovsky, Tasmanian Devils chronicles events on the Australian island when a group of American base-jumpers inadvertently spawn several amped-up Tasmanian devils from folklore. The Americans team-up with three rangers to (try to) survive.

The low scores are inexplicable (with a 3.6/10 average on IMDb) in light of the fact that this is a competent monsters-in-the woods survival/horror/adventure flick. Sure, the diverse cast is no-name, except for Danica McKellar (best known, of course, for her role as Winnie Cooper on The Wonder Years), and the CGI creatures are decidedly cartoony, but Tasmanian Devils otherwise delivers the goods as a suspenseful, gory creatures-on-the-loose TV picture with breathtaking forest locations. Danica is super-cute, as usual, but shed be sexier if she gained at least 15 lbs.

Australians complain about the accents, but the Australians in the movie sounded Australian to these ears. Another nitpicker complained about the Gerry-rigged flame thrower. Seriously?

THE MOVIE RUNS 86 minutes and was shot in British Columbia. WRITER: Brook Durham. ADDITIONAL CAST: Kenneth Mitchell & Mike Dopud emerge as the most prominent base jumpers. Winter Olympian gold-medalist Apolo Ohno has a small role.
