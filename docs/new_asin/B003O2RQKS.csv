4161580,5,B003O2RQKS,"Watching Lang Lang tackle Beethoven's Appassionata Sonata is like watching little David felling Goliath. Lang Lang's technique is eye-popping and his interpretation is from a youth with much feeling and strength. This is true of his whole program which includes the Beethoven C Major Sonata Op. 2, No. 3, Albeniz's Iberia Book 1, Prokofiev's Sonata No. 7, and three Chopin encores: the Aolian Harp Etude, the Heroic Polonaise, and the Grande Valse Brilliante. The picture and sound are excellent. You can't go wrong buying this DVD. It is much more valuable than the surprising low price for which it is selling.",1287705600,25,612,5.069306930693069

4161583,3,B003O2RQKS,Lang Lang is very talented. But his selections on this CD disappointed me. It makes better listening as background in my pickup than serious listening in my living room.,1395705600,,169,4.862068965517241
4161584,5,B003O2RQKS,"I have many recordings of Beethoven in LP,CD and DVD,but this one is really fantastic. Lan Lang's playing is vigorous and passionated, maybe a bit too much on the ""dynamics"" side,but I think Beethoven would have liked to hear it or at least since it was Beethoven to see it played !
The image of the buray is perfect and the sound of the piano is clear and full bodied. Here I disagree with one of your reviewers who complained about the lack of bass. This may be due to one's sound equipment.
A very good buy!",1380931200,2,510,4.268041237113402
4161585,5,B003O2RQKS,The DVD is just so great to sit with a wine and envelope yourself with magnificent music.a must to have.,1380758400,,104,4.25
4161586,3,B003O2RQKS,"It did not include my favorite Lang Lang masterpieces: Rachmaninof's and Gershwin's ""Rhapsody in Blue"". I wish I could find an album wwith my favs.",1376006400,,147,4.92
4161587,5,B003O2RQKS,"Absolutely Great performance. The recording is exceptionally good and the way it is filmed allows us to appreciate the mastery of Lang Lang as pianist. The way he played the third movement of ""Appassionata""  is memorable; and I kept thinking how impressed and pleased Beethoven would have felt had he listened to this kind of performance.",1370476800,4,338,5.035714285714286
4161588,4,B003O2RQKS,"The first thing to say about this recital is that it gave a great number of people in Vienna a lot of pleasure - and the disc will equally give similar pleasure to a great number of people world-wide, and I include myself. I found the technical side of the presentation to provide excellent visual and sonic reproduction.

However, like all artistes, Lang Lang has many strengths to offer but equally he is not yet infallible. Consequently this recital is at its best when he plays to his strengths and is at its least effective when those same strengths do not naturally serve the chosen music so well.
Lang Lang is essentially a very emotional player and plays everything as he feels - and he feels everything very deeply. One could summarise this by describing him as a romantic. His playing contains a great deal of expression from loud to soft and especially, enormous fluctuations of tempo almost moment by moment. The most successful parts of this recital are therefore those that respond best to such a romantically emotional approach.

The two Beethoven sonatas, coming from a composer writing at the transitional stage progressing from the more formal classical period to the freer romantic period, are well able to sustain such an approach. Indeed there are many breathtakingly beautiful moments in these interpretations, especially in the slower sections. The Chopin encores respond equally well to such an approach.

The Albeniz is more of a mixed bag. The slower sections are effective in these ways but the faster sections lack the rhythmic discipline required to capture the Spanish dance elements being portrayed - and Spanish dancing is nothing if not tightly rhythmical. Anyone who doubts this could refer to recordings by either Larrocha or Hamilyn who are both able to incorporate the freer romantic elements with the tighter dance elements.

The same problems are to be found in the Prokofiev sonata where strict tempo is essential almost throughout. If this is not maintained the slow central movement loses shape and direction and the driven outer movements fail in their dramatic drive. Interestingly it is the most motoric last movement, a toccata, that is undoubtedly the most successful here and why? - Because Lang Lang plays it almost entirely in strict tempo. Unfortunately he does not do this in the preceding two movements. There are numerous examples on disc of the benefits of playing this music with more disciplined rhythmical control. Lang Lang himself quotes his admiration for Richter and Sokolov and to this I would add the benchmark Pollini CD and Lang Lang's contemporary Yuja Wang to his recommendations. Sokolov can be seen playing the Prokofiev on a fine recital DVD and there is an alternative excellent recital by Gavrylyuk on DVD containing Prokofiev's 6th and 7th sonatas as part of a technically astonishing recital.

I am aware that this review will not please many of Lang Lang's countless fans who will resist the provisos above. However the job of a reviewer is to try and give an honest appraisal without bias and with a view to being helpful, giving supporting reasons for the opinions that are expressed. That is what is being offered here and it is best to conclude with the opening comments that `The first thing to say about this recital is that it gave a great number of people in Vienna a lot of pleasure - and the disc will equally give similar pleasure to a great number of people world-wide, and I include myself.' I would suggest that 4 stars is a fair assessment bearing in mind all of the above.",1356048000,,3564,4.884297520661157
4161589,4,B003O2RQKS,"I agree with one reviewer that the sound quality of this DVD, though very good, is a little limited in dynamic range. While the high notes are clear, the low notes are a little lacking in comparison with modern-day CD or DVD-Audio recordings, which are able to capture the dynamics of pianos that the listener can ""feel"". But all this comment about the audio quality should not (cannot) overshadow an excellent live performance by Lang Lang; particularly the Appassionata sonata, in which Lang Lang's artistry reminds me of great recordings by Gilels and Pollini. Very enjoyable and highly recommended.",1352505600,4,602,5.090909090909091
4161590,5,B003O2RQKS,"First class production.

In conclusion therefore, I will return to the opening comments that `The first thing to say about this recital is that it gave a great number of people in Vienna a lot of pleasure - and the disc will equally give similar pleasure to a great number of people world-wide, and I include myself.'

I would suggest that if you are attracted by this concert and the manner of the performances within, then this disc should warrant your serious consideration. If you have any doubts such as outlined above, then I would suggest that this disc may not be for you.",1342483200,5,3756,4.903937007874016
4161592,5,B003O2RQKS,"I have been following Lang Lang's career for a while and watching how he has progressed.  I finally got to see him live performing Rachmaninoff's 2nd piano concerto.  Absolutely blown out of the water.  This DVD Blu Ray brings back that live performance that I experienced.  The man is impeccable.  Would recommend to any piano enthusiast.  He plays a beautiful Steinway ""D""  Concert Grand.  I would give this a 10 star if that were available.",1334534400,6,443,4.8133333333333335
4161593,5,B003O2RQKS,"I first heard Lang Lang play in a recital - just pure piano and amazing artistry. I knew I was taking in something very special in my musical experience. He plays with immense technical skill, but also with heart and soul. I recommend the Live in Vienna Blu-ray as a great way to bring Lang Lang as a performer into your musical world.",1329004800,5,335,4.333333333333333
4161594,5,B003O2RQKS,"I am finding that I really much prefer bluray to dvd any day.  It's great to see the details close-up on Lang Lang's hands as he plays and the details in his facial expressions.  The beautiful fixtures hanging from the ceiling look great, too.  All of the playing is fabulous, and Lang Lang plays with his usual confidence.  I could not detect a hint of uncertainty in his playing at any time.  Bravo!",1325203200,4,401,4.438356164383562
4161595,5,B003O2RQKS,"Lang Lang does it again.  Vienna is a tough crowd.  They gave him a most sustained standing ovation, that was much deserved.  This is a record of a memorable performance that deserves to be next to Lang Lang at Carnegie Hall.  A great performance by one of the most talented performers of our time.",1319414400,3,298,4.462962962962963
4161596,2,B003O2RQKS,"I realize that Lang Lang playing brings young people to his concerts. I am all for that. I like his theatrical approach to the Beethoven Sonatas,Albeniz, Iberia Book 1,Prokofiev Piano sonata No7 and his Chopin. He has the technique, but no passion in his playing. A good showman with an excellent Technique, but nothing else. Over the years he may obtain this. One has to compare him to the young Helene Grimaud playing the Ravel piano Concerto in G, conducted by Vladimir Jurowski. The 2nd Movement is breathtaking and extremely moving as played by Helene. Lang Lang could not match her,for he has no substance.",1315526400,10,612,4.838095238095238
4161597,5,B003O2RQKS,"It isn't often that a pianist can play every composer superbly, but thats what we have here. And as for the sound quality,after playing it on my Sony MHC-EC55 Mini Hi Fi Component System (cost me a little over $90.00 at Walmart a few years ago but read the customer reviews here on amazon) the piano sounds like its right in the living room. This DVD proves that Lang Lang is a superb virtuoso and musician, and also sets several standards for musical excellence that have never been surpassed and rarely equalled.

With the two Beethoven Sonatas featured here, it is not just the power of Lang Lang's playing that singles him out, but also the beauty, when he has such subtle control over a formidable wide tonal range. Even at its weightiest, the sound is never clangorous. Particularly in the early Sonata No. 3 opus 2, Lang Lang brings out the wit and parody, while in the slow movement regularly draws a sensuously velvety legato. The clarity of Lang Lang's articulation is breathtaking throughout the great ""Appasionata"" Sonata No. 23  evoking memories of Gilels, Serkin and Brendel both technically and musically, (he includes the repeat in the last movement) with breathtaking virtuosity, vivid imagination, superb feeling and expression,all of which is without sentimentality.(exactly the way Beethoven wanted it and with expressive insights identical to the Schnabel edition) No one has ever played these works better than this.

Lang Lang is also highly sensitive to the subtle nuances of Albeniz evocative piano writing, and his gentle sensouos inflexions are consistently seductive from the opening 'Evocacion' of Iberia book 1 onwards. His pianism is captivating in its delicacy of touch and crisp articulation, beguilling charm and character to these rewarding miniature tone-poems and making light of their sometimes fiendish technical difficulties. He penetrates the ethos of these pieces with a natural feeling to their Spanish atmosphere.

  In the Prokofiev Sonata (which he plays as least as well as Horowitz and Richter) and the Chopin encores,(he plays the famous ""Heroic"" Polonaise as well as Josef Lhevinne, something nobody has ever been able to do before, not even Horowitz) the evenness and ease of all his runs and arpeggios, the commanding , penetrating power, always expressively graduated and shaded, the positive intensity (so different from pounding) with which significant single tones are struck and made to vibrate through and through the listener, Lang Lang unites all the qualities of a complete pianist, with no weakness or flaws anywhere.

To summarize; Lang Lang stands today for all that is exquisite and poetic in the domain of the piano. His touch is original, his manipulation of the instrument unnapproachable, a virtuoso among virtuosi, and the beauty of his tone, its velvety aristocratic quality, so free from any suspicion of harshness or brutality, gives him a unique position in the music loving world. Lang Lang was born for the piano and evokes memories of the 19th century keyboard giants that studied directly under Franz Liszt, most notably Carl Tausig, Liszts favorite pupil.",1308873600,18,3134,5.181818181818182
4161598,5,B003O2RQKS,"I've watched it at least 10 times.  Definitely one of the best concert DVDs in my collection.
The incredible part is that he played pieces from 4 composers of different eras and completely different music style.
And he plays all of them extremely well - full of energy and passion, besides technically brilliant.
Audiences in Vienna obviously agree,  as he drove them to their feet many times.
2 hours of note-perfection playing with style is indeed impressive!",1300752000,4,461,4.974025974025974
4161599,3,B003O2RQKS,"Video quality is of course fine, but for my taste too many cuts. Another director that got his training at MTV. Each take on average 3 seconds, with shorter takes in the beginning and longer takes towards the end. He learnt a bit or got tired himself. Overhead shots were not good enough but needed to spin, too. Your taste may differ.
I listened to the surround track of the concert (5.1 DTS-HD) and it is not that great, either. Little use of the side channels and the piano sounds not as full as it does on other recordings I have.
Normally, I don't watch the bonus program (here excerpts of the same pieces played in the Berghain club, but recorded in 3-D for a future release, sound is 5.0 DTS-HD), but someone had  mentioned the different acoustics, so I checked it out. Low and behold, that sound is much better.
I don't think it's the acoustic of the room, but the microphones and the placement. In the concert, there are 4 microphones, 2 at the narrow end of the piano (which I believe don't do much for the sound) and 2 in front, very close to the piano, about piano high. In the club, there are 3 different microphones in front of the piano, about 3 feet apart from each other and about 15 feet away from the piano. Different audio technicians/directors too.
So this disc turns out to be an example of how different the sound can be based on who does it and how it is done (good or not so good). The Berghain guys did a better job and the bonus material sounds better than the concert.
""Jundi Li in Baden-Baden"" sounds in concert just as good as Lang Lang in the club, DTS 5.1
The Verbier Festival Piano Extravaganza is much better recorded as far as surround sound is concerned.
So Lang Lang 5 stars, audio 3 stars",1294185600,36,1726,4.343653250773994
4161600,5,B003O2RQKS,"What a treat! An amazing performance. A lot has been written about Lang Lang unconventional performances and techniques. This performance is just a delight to listen to and to watch it. The camera shots are very creative and the sound beautifully reproduced. For less than $20 you can be in Vienna on the first raw. You can't go wrong with that. As Lang Lang matures, I hope to see him perform at additional concerts with more daring repertoire.",1290816000,15,445,4.717948717948718

8401366,5,B003O2RQKS,"If you go to amazon.uk, you will find a blu-ray with third dimension (3d) of Lang Lang in Vienna. With this video, I don't think you will have the sound problems that some reviewers had with the DVD. Even with just the blu you felt as though you were at the concert. I did not find his facial expressions distracting at all. If anything, I thought he clued me in to what he thought the composer intended - playful, angry, meditative, romantic, etc. Although I am a music major, I realized to get the full benefit of the music, I have to participate with it and understand what the composer was going through as he wrote. So I'm going to look for more of his work, but in blu - definitely. What you need is a region-free blu-ray player, preferably a 3d blu if you can find one.",1498867200,,776,4.25
