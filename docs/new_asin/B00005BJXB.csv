1424432,5,B00005BJXB,"The material is very well organized and narrated.  It does a great job describing the strategy, tactics, and outcome of the operations described in it's three 1-hour chapters: ""The Buildup; The Invasion; The Breakout"".  After seen this, you should need no other reference source for this topic. NOTES: Much of the documentary is based on old B&W footage I have never seen (I.e. not in ""The World At War""). And the video quality is  only adequate. There is some extra material related to WW2, but not to D-Day.",1209427200,4,509,4.761363636363637
1424433,4,B00005BJXB,"I love military history documentaries and have watched about 40 of them on the History and Discovery Channels.  I bought this one because I can re-watch segments of it without getting tired of it.  Its extensive (3 hours) but not boring.  Its in black and white but it feels modern.  It is well narrated, accurate  and very thorough.  I especially like the coverage of the invasion planning, which starts 2 years earlier.  Its depiction of the operation to convince the Germans that Calais was the real target was excellent.",1037836800,25,524,4.820224719101123
1424434,5,B00005BJXB,"I'VE ALWAYS FELT THE NOTHING WOULD EVER COME CLOSE TO THE 1970'S SERIES THE WORLD AT WAR, BUT I BELIEVE THIS SURPASSES IT. IT IS LOADED WITH INFORMATION, FACTS, MAPS, AND INTERESTING STORIES.. 3 HOURS OF VIDEO 20  MINUTES OF IT IN COLOR TAKEN STRAIGHT FROM GEORGE STEVENS D-DAY TO BERLIN.  NOT THE USUAL FOOTAGE AND GENERAL OVERVIEW. AND YOU CAN'T BEAT THE PRICE  EITHER. I WISH THIS COMPANY WOULD DO A SIMILAR DOCUMENTARY ON THE EASTERN  FRONT OR NORTH AFRICA.",963878400,16,461,4.654320987654321

7937664,4,B00005BJXB,"When I saw this video, I was impressed with the narration and amount of video I had not seen before.  After seeing World at War and many other WW2 videos, seeing something I had not seen before is surprising so I was pretty happy to spend nearly three hours seeing the action of D-Day and the breakout from Normandy.  Well worth the minimal cost.",1461888000,,346,4.390625

to say in the negative and I highly reccommend this for those

7937668,2,B00005BJXB,since WWII came out on BD I Guess everbody's trying to do the same. TIMELESS media BD's look no better on BD than top quality standard DVD's. Buyer beware of spending extra for BD war doc. The only purpose of using BD is they put more on BD than DVD. Quanity over quality I guess.,1292630400,10,280,4.109090909090909

7937670,5,B00005BJXB,"If you are looking for the one DVD that will tell the story of Operation Overlord, you can't do better than this one.  It not only shows what really happened during the invasion of Europe, but the narration accompanying the pictures tells the story, the background and the details.  I have many DVDs about this subject, but this is the ONLY one I would recommend as the last word in total coverage.",1222992000,8,398,4.513888888888889
7937671,3,B00005BJXB,"This dvd set is actually not too bad, but it'll be an amalgamation of all the D-Day footage you've already seen.  It does include some of the color footage that is featured in other sets, Capa's Omaha beach footage, german footage, etc.  The narration is a reader's digest account of the landings.

The annoyance is the over use of the same ""combat training"" footage to overlap chronological gaps in the actual combat footage of the landings.  The airborne operations practice footage is reused as footage of the actually deployment, but clearly it is in the daytime and too organized to be the actual drop.  The same goes for infantry footage.  The same trench training is shown as part of the invasion.

Overall, for the $5 I paid, not too bad.  I would have been mad if I paid $10 though.",1222560000,3,791,4.6
