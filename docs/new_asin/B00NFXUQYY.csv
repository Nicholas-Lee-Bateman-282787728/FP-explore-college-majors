8677788,5,B00NFXUQYY,I built a 3 string guitar in a workshop in Visalia Ca. And was looking for a video to give me some ideas of playing it. I have been taking 6 stir g guitar lessons for about a year and have purchased dozens of books and videos that I thought would be the Magic bullet to make me a great player. Of course no such thing. But this video is so clear and casual that it made me feel he was in the room talking to me. Gave me the basics of a three string and the knowledge needed to start experimenting on my own. I really enjoyed it. I have just ordered his 3 string slide video. Hope it is done in the same style.,1465516800,,609,3.8412698412698414
