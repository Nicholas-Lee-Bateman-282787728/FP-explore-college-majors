4484651,5,B004VV43XO,"My Son and his friend (3 and 4 years old) love watching Pocoyo.  They laugh and dance along with each episode.  As a parent, I like the fact that each episode is maybe 10 min in length.  If I just need a short break, my son is satisfied with just watching one or two episodes and doesn't fuss when the tv is turned off.",1328572800,,319,3.953125
4484652,5,B004VV43XO,"My daughter has loved Pocoyo and his friends since she was six months old. She just recently turned a year old and we purchased this DVD for her birthday. She already has one other Pocoyo DVD and literally lights up when he comes on the screen. While the DVD is wonderful, I'm a little disapointed that on some episodes, the ""moderator"" and even Pocoyo have different voices. I suppose that's no fault of anyone's but the creaters of the show, but as a mom who hears this DVD a few times a week, it's a little annoying. But, my daughter doesn't notice and loves it just the same!! These little characters are so cute!",1325808000,,617,4.421052631578948
4484653,5,B004VV43XO,"We have been buying all the Pocoyo DVDs as my grandchildren AND husband LOVE them!  This series is about a little boy dressed in blue and how he interacts with all his little friends (Elly, Pato, Lula, Sleepy bird and baby bird, Caterpillar, Fred -a Quatra-puss (we only see four legs not eight) and some funny little aliens.  We love Stephen Fry's narration of the story as it delves into a number of life's lessons (i.e. sharing, overcoming fear, learning to apologize, ""tidying-up"" and just being a good friend, and many more).
  One of the episodes on this DVD is where Pocoyo uses Pato as an air guitar which is absolutely hysterical.  And this would explain why my husband and adults also enjoying watching this series as the characters are so entertaining and just fun to watch!  This series is so eye-catching and entertaining that this is pretty much all my grandson will ask to watch when coming over for a visit.  He recites the words along with the characters and mimics expressions which are so endearing.
  I say... BUY them all (DVDs)!  I know I am and so anxious to get the rest of season 2!  You can also catch episodes on kids television or do a search on YouTube.  Pocoyo ROCKS!",1317513600,11,1197,4.568075117370892

4484658,4,B004VV43XO,"My two year old grandson loves POCOYO.  This video had him dancing along with Pocoyo, Ellie and Pato. The only thing I didn't like was I couldn't get my grandon to stop dancing (lol).",1388793600,,183,4.382352941176471

Recommend this DVD.",1371168000,,106,3.8636363636363638
4484661,5,B004VV43XO,"I'm not sure why my 2 year old becomes mesmerize by this particular show.  He will literally stop whatever he is doing and just stare at this.  Is it the simplicity of it?  The narration?  Don't know.  He just loves it.  Obviously it is crafted to do what it is doing and it does it well.  The characters are pretty funny, especially the yellow duck, and the animations are done well.  I like that the show teaches all the important things that you'd want children to learn such as sharing, kindness, creativity, etc.  I know that some kids gravitate to certain shows more than others but mine certainly is captivated by Pocoyo.  We own quite a few of these discs and they all have a number of different shows and they last more than an hour...giving him plenty of Pocoyo time.  It is a great show that is designed to entertain and educate children and for that I highly recommend.",1370995200,,881,4.44375
4484662,5,B004VV43XO,Good for young children. My son has watched this from ages 3 to 5 and still enjoys it. Would recommend.,1369612800,,103,4.2

4484666,5,B004VV43XO,"I lucked onto this gift for my two grandsons.  I saw it recommended on a mother's site, probably CafeMom.  Since my grandsons are half Hispanic, I thought this was a way to bridge a gap.  They have loved them and since there are SO many versions; DVDs, books, coloring books, puzzles, etc. it makes for lots of gifts and so easy for me since I don't get to see them often enough to know what they like.",1358985600,,402,4.194805194805195

4484668,5,B004VV43XO,As soon as I put it on he is mesmerized.  He likes seeing several episodes in a row instead of one at a time.,1351814400,,109,3.5416666666666665
4484669,5,B004VV43XO,Kids under 3 will be glued to the t.v. watching this. If you need some time to yourself this will work.,1336608000,,103,3.9523809523809526
4484670,4,B004VV43XO,"White screen, weird voice, and strange characters. And yet kids LOVE Pocoyo. I bought these for our library, to check out to parents, and they are the hottest DVD we have. They are never on the shelf.

I do not get it, personally, but our patrons love these movies because their babies love these movies. One patron ruined the disk, her son had scratched it by taking the disk out of the case and trying to put in the computer repeatedly. He is not yet two and was trying to play DVD's on the computer.

Dance, Pocoyo, Dance, is funny. But it is not as 'adult friendly' as the Muppets, or other children's entertainment. So get Pocoyo if you want something that toddlers and babies will watch alone, on repeat, without your intervention.",1334620800,,737,4.533834586466165
4484671,5,B004VV43XO,"We have a 3 1/2 year old that spends some time in our home. We catch the 10 minute episodes of Pocoyo on PBS on occasion, and he just loves them, but they only come on twice a day. I thought it would be fun to have a video for rainy or boring days in the house. We really enjoyed this dvd. The cartoon is quite cute, entertaining, and fun, even for adults. The stories are short, so they keep the kids' attention, and they always have a wonderful little moral (like sharing, working together, helping a friend, etc.). And, unlike some of the popular cartoons or shows, they're not annoying or tiresome for adults to watch. I have shown this show to several children, both boys and girls, and ages 6 months to 5 years, and they all enjoy this show. I purchased 4 Pocoyo dvds at once, and ended up giving two of them to a girlfriend who has a toddler and runs a child day care from her home, and she and her kids love them, as well! And again, they range in age from a few months old to almost kindergarten. She loves that, on a rainy or housebound day, it catches and keeps the kids' attention, they laugh, play along, and really enjoy the stories.

I didn't notice when I was considering purchasing this dvd, but there are several stories/skits on each dvd, which adds up to an hour (or more) per dvd. I wasn't certain, since the shows are only 10 minutes on tv, so that's why I purchased 4 dvds. But, since they are each so long and have so many shows on each one, that is why I gifted two of them to my friend. I knew her kids would enjoy them and she would make good use of them. Great purchase!",1334102400,,1598,4.15483870967742
4484672,5,B004VV43XO,"Pocoyo isn't my thing, and I don't understand the draw, but my kids absolutely LOVE Pocoyo! Since they also both like music and like to dance, this seemed like an obvious choice to purchase, although they're such fans I don't think it would have mattered which Pocoyo movie I got. It's one of their favorites!",1329004800,2,309,4.636363636363637
4484673,5,B004VV43XO,My 1 1/2 yr old granddaughter cracks up watching Pocoyo...who knew?! It is quite a cute and entertaining bit of animation but the reaction she has to it is priceless! She literally is laughing hysterically. Great investment the kids will watch again and again.,1328745600,,260,4.931818181818182

8444124,4,B004VV43XO,My 1.5 year likes Pocoyo but this isn't one of his favorites. It doesn't hold his attention span like his other Pocoyo and N Circle dvds. Maybe it'll grow on him later as he gets older. The reason I give 4 stars is because the bonus cd with near 3 hours of other various N Circle shows is great and very entertaining to my 1.5 year old. It has 1 episode from all the N Circle shows which is vast. The dvd also automatically starts itself over once it reaches the end. Another plus! Without the bonus dvd this review would only be 2 stars.,1476489600,,538,4.133333333333334
