462194,5,630244327X,Juice is an excellent inner city thriller that doesn't get the credit it deserves. It belongs alongside Menace II Society and Boyz n the hood. An outstanding cast with a scary premise and an incredible performance by Tupac Shakur. It shows what an amazing talent he was not just a rapper and poet but as an actor as well. His performance is frightening. Juice has always been under the radar along with another great Tupac movie Above the rim for some reason. Both are must sees.,1468108800,5,479,4.5813953488372094

462319,5,630244327X,"I had not seen this movie until this year, and I was told by friends (and Hip Hop/Rap music fans) it's a classic. I watched with a friend who had not seen it in years. It was like we were watching it together for the first time.

Tupac plays a really good ""crazy"" or true ""thug"" like character. I was surprised by the endings outcome. I had no idea what to expect but it was different. It was coo to see a young Tupac acting. Perhaps, if I grew up in the inner city or saw it when it came out in the 90s I would had been able to relate or think it was as classic as what others say. In any event, it was worth the few dollars spent.

It's worth 90 minutes if you  have to time to sit back and watch. Perhaps your thoughts of the story will be different. In any event, I am glad to have watched to say I have seen it now too.

Directed by Ernest Dickerson who did 'BulletProof' and a few episodes of 'The Wire', it is his gritty direction AND the unspoken tension and chemistry between the two leads, Omar Epps and 2pac, that puts this above average. It's nicely laced with an early 90s rap beat soundtrack that will make you nostalgic if you grew up in that era like I did.

In the beginning of 1992 when i was 7 years old, Juice is the post-Boyz 'n the Hood-New Jack City epic is when I first saw my eyes of 2Pac in the movie screen. Quincy now as ""Q"" (Omar Epps) was a true character earned respect as a scratch-and-mix DJ. But Bishop (played by Shakur), hands down! Bishop was a deep brother with a deadly plan as armed robbery. So, it took a turn when Bishop shot the Latin convenient-store owner, All things of hell broke loose. Bishop rises up as a madman to shot Radames, Quiles, and also Steel and last, Raheem! That's where it send a truthful shock when Bishop was changed. The last scene gives me the great moments,ever! Post-Raheem, Quiles, and Steel's shooting by Bishop, it's Q's turn to take out on him for good because Bishop frames Q. So when Q/Bishop battling on the last scene, Quincy (""Q"") Powell saves the day! This movie was part of my favorable ""in the hood"" movies. Of course, this movie came out when New Jack Swing stops dancing or i'll say the beginning of post-New Jack era comes through(R. Kelly, Mary J. Blige, Jodeci, etc.). Another moments form that movie is the DJ competition with guests in hip-hop like Queen Latifah, Dr. Dre and Ed Lover, great memories. 2Pac was rising that time before he slipped hard when he got shot in Quad Studios in 1994. Jermaine ""Huggy"" Hopkins (Lean on Me) was the lucky, handsome brother when he saw Bishop pulls a pistol on three quys, he was scared. Gotta give a true props to the whole Wrecking crew. Great movie. Great scenes. Great characters. And Great soundtrack! I wish Paramount could added music videos (Naughty by Nature's ""Uptown Anthem"", Teddy Riley/Tammy Lucas' ""Is It Good to You"", Aaron Hall's ""Don't Be Afraid"", Big Daddy Kane's comeback ""Nuff Respect"" and last the great, Eric B. & Rakim's ""Juice aka Know the Ledge""), that would've been better.

As soon as he gets his hands on a gun, Bishop finally snaps. It has a great setting, immersive dialogue and action between characters, and a great soundtrack. Tupac shows us that he wasn't just another rapper-turned-actor like most rappers nowadays; he was actually a very talented actor, and Juice shows it. The only thing I didn't like was the abrupt ending. I thought it was weak and could've been better.

Overall, I highly recommend Juice. If you have Netflix Streaming, it is available as of 7/23/12, but a purchase is recommended as well.

Juice has some violence and blood, and strong language. No sex or nudity.",1343001600,,773,4.804511278195489

Torn between his dream of becoming a rap DJ and his devotion to his friends, ""Q"" (Omar Epps) gets pressured into a store robbery instigated by Bishop (Tupac Shakur). But a quest for respect and power leads to disaster when the game plan goes awry and their lives change forever. Samuel L. Jackson shines in a bit part as a billiards hall proprietor.

A very real and frightening and vivid account of life in the hood. The landscapes painted and motifs symbolized have appeared time and time again in hip-hop culture and  in Hollywood.

The opening of the film was impactful, catching the traits of four friends and their personalities. It resembled an East-Coast version of Boyz 'N' The Hood, with stereotypes, charismatic ensemble cast and a dynamic setting.

462806,3,630244327X,"Ernest Dickerson's Juice is a tragic tale of young black teenagers on a misguided quest for power and respect. In directing his fist full film after years of being Spike Lee's Cinematographer, Dickerson's camera tells a story very well. However the underdeveloped screenplay is missing small details. These small story points keep Juice from being the chilling human drama about the psychology of violence it wants to be and renders it into just another violent ""hood"" movie.

Juice follows four African-American teenagers Q (Omar Epps) Steel (Jermaine Hopkins) Bishop (Tupac Shakur) and Raheim on a misguided quest for ""juice"" the respect and approval of their peers. All the kids come from working class homes in Harlem with the exception of Bishop who lives with his grandmother and mentally ill father. All of them have an opportunity to go to school, however they'd rather spend their days hanging out in the street fooling around playing video games at a neighborhood arcade. All three boys have no direction or goal to be anything with the exception of Q who wants to be a hip-hop DJ. Fooling around in the street leads to a beef with some Hispanic kids, a run in with a Korean store owner and running away from the White cops. All except for Steel get away from the police on the hooky patrol.

Later in the day after Steel gets out of school, the boys do some shoplifting at a record store before Q walks into a stick-up in a local bar. The stick up man cuts Q in the action but he declines and leaves. Upon hearing about the offer Bishop eagerly rushes to join the stick up man. However, Raheim stops him. The boys instead go to Steel's house to hang out and watch gangster movies. After watching the 5:00 news and seeing the stick up guy's tragic death, Bishop starts showing signs of mental illness. Fed up with being run by cops, the Hispanic gang, and the Korean store owner he comes up with the idea to rob the Korean store. Bishop thinks the boys will get respect or ""juice"" in the neighborhood. Even though the others see flaws in Bishop's twisted plan they reluctantly they go along with the criminal scheme.

Days go by. Q goes to an audition for a DJ battle. Raheim gets a revolver that Bishop eagerly takes possession of. The plans is to use the Q's DJ battle as an alibi then go rob the Korean grocer later in the evening. Things go all to plan until power mad Bishop starts to lose it, murdering the grocer after getting the money. While the other boys are terrified, Bishop is drunk from power. He betrays his friends and kills Raheim. Afraid of what Bishop will do to them, Steel and Q return to the DJ battle as if nothing has happened. After a police interrogation the boys go on with their lives. Bishop continues on in his homicidal spree looking for respect gunning down the Latin gang leader and later Steel. He's gunning for Q who buys his own gun. Almost killing a stranger, Q tosses it in the river. Bishop manipulates people into believing Q has killed everyone. With the police looking for him, Q has a showdown with the sociopath Bishop on a Harlem rooftop ends in Bishop's death. The movie ends with the Ironic revelation of Q getting the ""juice"" Bishop wanted. Q realizes that the cost of this ""juice"" is too high.

As I stated earlier, Juice has all the elements of a great movie except the screenplay. The uneven uninspired script makes this flavorless Juice hard to swallow at times. The bland stock characters are all underdeveloped and the theme of the movie is unclear. Was this cautionary tale to prevent young black men from going down the path of crime? Was it a story about four kids on a tragic downward spiral in a misguided quest for respect? From what I watched it looked like these four young black males actually had an opportunity to get ""juice"" by going to school, the place they desperately wanted to avoid.

Juice overcomes its weak screenplay with solid direction and cinematography from Ernest Dickerson and strong performances from its actors. Omar Epps gives a solid performance as Q. The late Tupac Shakur is chilling to watch as Bishop. Shakur adds dimension and depth to the one-dimensional Bishop showing us a young man descending further and further into mental illness. Samuel L. Jackson is solid in his small role as an arcade owner. In his few frames onscreen he feels just like a neighborhood guy who would own a rundown store like that back in the day. Look for FLEX (Flex Alexander) and Queen Latifah in cameo roles.

Dickerson's camera captures the grittiness of early 1990's pre-gentrified Harlem very realistically. His visuals are great, filming on rooftops, inside abandoned buildings and in those nooks and crannies show us all those secret places teenagers without direction go to hang out when they cut hooky. Growing up in the city at that time I can tell you that the streets were as rough as depicted on film and the mood of the city was just as bleak. Back then New York was a place where over 2,100 murders happened, (many still unsolved until this day) schools failed students regularly and criminals made the law instead of politicians.

Ernest Dickerson's Juice is tasteful, but it doesn't have enough flava to get on the Shawn James Five Star essential list. It's worth a rental at best. Pick it up along with New Jack City and Jason's Lyric.",1141603200,3,5333,4.64899257688229
462807,3,630244327X,"This movie only made me appreciate the far superior craft, cast, and directing of ""Boyz N The Hood"" and ""New Jack City.""  It's not awful, but not very good either.

Slow pacing, predictable plot, high-school-level acting and dialogue made this feel a lot longer than it actually was.  Even the few fight/action scenes were clumsily done, especially the convenience store robbery.  Just zero tension or punch.

The film has some good intentions (mainly to show the plight of inner city low income teens, how easily they can fall into trouble in that environment) but good intentions cannot save a poorly executed work like this.",1140048000,5,627,4.990384615384615
462808,5,630244327X,"You can read other folks reviews to get the gist of the plot, so I'll skip it...

Main thing I can say about this movie is that it's a morality tale, but with a lot of action and suspense.

The music, the lighting, the camera shots, the cuts, they all add to the suspense that takes off in one crucial scene and then builds. The bedroom DJ scene with ""Q"" cutting up records is one highlight, but as things move forward Tupac's acting really starts to run the film. No matter what you feel about the current cashing on Pac as the James Dean of Hip Hop, he did a dang good job of acting in this film. The creepy detachment, snake like smoothness, and cold calculatedness of Bishop is pretty creepy & memorable. If you want to see one movie that shows the late Tupac's acting skills, this would be it.

However, equally as good in my opinion is the acting of Omar Epps. The looks of fear, caution, and trepidation Epps gives are a great contrast to Tupac's eerie ghetto smoothness. Just with his facial expressions, Epps's character is a symbol of the lost innocence and fear experienced by ghetto youth. No matter how much Q just wants to DJ, like many urban youth, through allegience to the wrong friends, he suddenly gets caught up in a tragic, dangerous, and tension filled situation. The danger keeps escalating,  no matter how hard he tries to avoid it, until he decides to confront his nemesis. Epps character shows the mounting suspense in as understated a way as a real urban teenager might have in a similar situation.  In my opinion, really good acting from Epps.

The  other important point I will make is that ultimately ""Juice"" is an anti-violence film. When a character is shot, the movie STOPS...the characters are shellshocked...the movie makes sure to highlight the emotional effects of what has just taken place. THAT is the reaction to violence that Hollywood SHOULD display in more films. Violence is still a terrible, shocking thing, and Juice (unlike MANY other films) makes sure THAT message gets across loud and clear, without the characters having to make excessive speeches about it. As we all know, this is a lesson the hip hop generation had to learn through the actual loss of Tupac not too many years after.

This is an action packed, suspenseful hip hop movie with very good acting from Epps and the late Pac- a 90's classic",1137369600,2,2353,4.6124401913875595

I understood the film's concept and where it was going, but the constant shift of the chracters made this even more of your basic thriller than possible. Tupac provided the best role although i'm not fond of watching him act, and Omar Epps, one of the most underrated actors made his role belivable and felt.

The film was basic, four friends living in Harlem going to the everyday life struggles of living there, then one day finnally come to an agreement of robing a store. This led to the killing of the clerk, of which Tupac's character was responsible of. The killing became freuent as he grew mad when holding the gun, and finally, Omar's character had to stop the murder-machine.

462862,4,630244327X,"The 1992 timeless 'hood movie ""Juice"" is a great drama movie which sort of turns into a thriller more towards the end. Directed by Ernest R. Dickerson, this movie just goes to show you what the longing for respect can do to a man and his friends. It has an excellent cast, with Omar Epps, Tupac Shakur, Khalil Kain, and Jermaine Hopkins playing the main gang. A few guest hip-hop stars appear as well. Juice also has an excellent soundtrack to go along with it. However, there are a few flaws in the movie, which I will point out later.

""Q"", (Omar Epps) is an up and coming local DJ hoping to find a major breakthrough with a DJ competition taking place at a local party. He is part of the Wrecking Crew, which also consists of the unstable Bishop (Tupac), Rahim (Khalil Kain), and Steel (Jermaine Hopkins). After roaming the streets one afternoon, Q runs into a friend of his named Blizzard in a local bar, who decides to stick the place up, and asks Q if he wants some. Q says no, and he and his friends leave. Later, at Steel's house, they see a news story on the TV about Blizzard being killed by policeman after he wounded a few of them. Well, this story pisses Bishop off, badly. He wants the juice. He convinces his friends to rob a convenience store; however, it's on the same night as Q's tournament. The Wrecking Crew rob the store, but while they are in it, everything goes wrong when Bishop shoots the store clerk, when he did nothing. It all goes downhill from here. Now Q is the only one that can stop Bishop from the madness that has taken over him since the store shooting, while at the same time trying to protect himself from him.

The only problem I have with the movie, really, is the climax and the ending. When the action is supposed to pick up, it really slows down. It's not dramatized or anything. I guess you can say that's a good thing but with movies it really ain't. The movie also ended weird. At the end it leaves you thinking ""is that it?"" It sure did that to me. Sometimes it seems like the movie was pointless, but the actors did a wonderful job at their roles, especially Tupac, that it picked up the slack.

So, I'd say pick this up if you're interested in African American cinema or hood/gangster movies, like me. If you're not, then well, this isn't for you. Maybe if you're just a fan of Tupac, since Bishop is probably his best role, in front of Birdie in Above the Rim (review for that is coming soon). Maybe even Omar Epps, since this is pobably his best role too. I give this 4 stars.",1107561600,4,2528,4.3178947368421055

462865,5,630244327X,"By far this is 2pac's best movie. He auditioned for the role of 'Bishop' as well as his buddy Treach. Treach admitted in The 2pac Thug Angel special that after seeing 2pac's audition, he knew right then and there that no way he would beat out 2pac for that role. And 2pac further validated that point with his powerful performance. Everytime I think of Juice, I think of 2pac's character. Treach actually got a different role as a homeboy of 'Radames'. It wasn't a big role but it's always good to see Treach in a movie. As for 'Radames', the first few times I saw him in the movie, I really didn't like him but when I found out he was in Empire, I started to respect this actor more. The actor's name is Vincent Laresca and I found out on his IMdB page that he was only a teenager in this movie. To me, that is real impressive how he played that part at such a young age. Another actor who also as a teenager did great was Omar Epps. He was great playing 'Q', a kid who wants to get respect by being a DJ. Epps was born to play that part. Khalil Kain did a great job as 'Raheem' and Jermaine Hopkins did a great job as 'Steel'. And you also notice a very reconizable face in a very small role by our standards. I'm talking about the legendary Samuel L. Jackson as 'Trip'. It wasn't a big role for him but his performance was just an added bonus to this powerful piece of work directed by Ernest Dickerson. Dickerson as you know worked with Spike Lee on 'Malcolm X' so it's no surprise that he did a fantastic job directing this movie. Who's a better director to learn from than Spike Lee?

Radimas:Bishop's worst enemy.  He always picks on Bishop when he has nothing to do.  But when he messes with him after the incident with the store, boy, he wished, he never even spoke to him.
This movie is all about power and respect.  But how Bishop becomes mr buddy-buddy, to I wan't to kill everyone is way beyond me.  I mean, unless you have problems, or you a completly twisted phsyco, how can that possibly happen.  Well, it's still is a positve movie, and if you like Tupac's acting, or a good black movie, go pick this up.",1053475200,,1553,4.4070175438596495

It's plot is awesome and it never bores.  It shows a really good example of how people live in the streets(not bums).

462951,4,630244327X,"Spike Lee cinematographer Ernest Dickerson (he shot Spike's first 6 films) makes a stylish, dark debut with the 1992 teen drama ""Juice"". Set in Harlem, the story chronicles the lives of 4 friends (including Tupac Shakur in a strong debut) trying to stay out of trouble. 'Q' is an aspiring DJ who holds fierce all his intentions to stay clean and away from danger. Steel is a chubby homeboy who wishes for nothing other than to have fun. Raheem, a teenage father, serves as the level-headed leader and peace keeper, and Bishop is a hot-headed firecracker eager to start war with the neighborhood gang (although these 4 don't behave like or consider themselves any sort of gang). Soon enough, trouble erupts when they rob the local liquor store in search of ""juice"" (power, respect) and a war erupts between Q and Bishop. Expectedly, Q would rather focus on an upcoming DJ contest but trash-talking Bishop has other plans.
Dickerson's directorial manner is sleek and balanced, his camera and editing preferences are not as out there and in-your-face as Spike Lee, yet he knows exactly where to put the camera for each scene (the cross-cutting police interrogation sequence is most dynamic, better than that of ""The Usual Suspects"" and it pre-dates that film by 3 years as well). Dickerson also chooses to avoid the obvious route expected in these kinds of films and delivers a sad, somber ending. The film is stamped hard with the look, sound and feel of the early 90's (an excellent era of those ""urban"" films if you ask me), colorful clothing, an excellent hip-hop soundtrack and murky neon lighting. If this is up your alley, I also suggest Bill Duke's equally powerful ""Deep Cover"" (also from 1992). It's too bad that Dickerson's further efforts have not topped this engaging premiere.",1033603200,16,1787,4.881578947368421

462956,4,630244327X,"Man, oh, man. I can't believe is' been 10 years since this movie's initial release.  My uncle worked as the projectionist at a run-down movie theater on the southside of my town when this came out, and he snuck me in to see this film at the tender age'a 12.  It was one of the first real, unflinching glimpses I got of black youth in the early '90s, the peer pressure thas' felt, as well as the mistakes that can lead to often severe consequences.  It was at the time, and remains today, an incredibly effective movie.

Anyways, enough'a the set-up, 'Juice' tells the story of four young hood cats, who spend they days ditching school, walkin' the streets of New York, goin' to the pool hall, hustlin' mixtapes for dough an' jus' laughing it up together the way friends do (this movie truly smacks'a the early '90s, but in the best possible way). They joke about girls with each other, who slept with who, get each other's back when someone has beef, and NEVER lose their trust in one another.  However it becomes apparent that the code of the neighborhood is that the person with the gun commands the most respect, and that mentality at too young an age is what turns everything wrong.  One of 'em gets their hands on a piece and decides the four of them should stick up the corner store, an' although there is some fear and doubt among them, ultimately they agree to go through with it.  There is sumpin' genuinely terrifying about watching these four kids, whom the film has allowed us to like and relate to like our closest homeboys, become armed robbers holding a gun to a poor, whimpering store clerk's head and demanding that he empty the cash register.  Without going into specifics, the robbery goes horribly wrong, and after a few days as the tension from local police looking for leads seems to die down, the friends quickly grow distant and, eventually, begin to suspect each other.  It's a pretty involving story as it unfolds, an' there are a few shocking scenes (though they aren't nearly as violent as I remember them being).  Omar Epps is pretty good in the lead role, the sensible and ambitious Q.  But, c'mon now.  It's obvious this is Tupac's movie.  I mean, face it, without him it would be nothing. Watching it now, it is even more interesting to see him so young and turning in such a powerful an' alarming debut. In the role of Bishop, the one who got the gun and who planned and initiated the robbery, he's riveting, delivering his lines with such guts and emotion, the most interesting character in the movie by far.  In the now-CLASSIC scene by the lockers in the school hallway, when he stares at Q with those intense eyes, and utters the now-famous line ""You're right. I am crazy. But you know what else? I don't give a f---"", you believe every word and the tension and terror in the air feels so real, it's chilling. As everything begins to unfold around him, his character Bishop becomes more and more merciless in his actions.

If you're a die-hard fan of Tupac, then you prob'ly are already up on this. But if you're jus' startin' to explore his music an' movies, you may as well go ahead and buy this one, because it's required watching material.  Of course, don't be swayed if you don't particularly like Tupac's music though either. It is still a very good movie, and anyone can see he had limitless potential as an actor.",1017532800,,3358,4.525619834710744

Who can forget the scene with Bishop and Q (Omar Epps) in the hallway by Q's locker. Epps does a good job as the ""Local"" Dj. but it is Pac that makes this movie so great.

As a music fan, I didn't think Pac could act this well, but I was amazed. He really comes across as so intense. It also shows you the tough choices that kids really have in these places, like the ghettos of Harlem or Brooklyn. Plus, you don't see many NYC based ""hood"" films.

The soundtrack is also very good, I especially like Naughty by Nature's ""Uptown Anthem"".  There are plenty of black gangster films that were shot in Los Angeles, however Juice was done in NYC, my homestate, and you really see the difference between the two.  I gave this DVD a 4 for the lack of special features.  I WISH there were more special features on this DVD.  I was really looking forward in maybe some deleted scenes, production notes, cast bio's or anything else.  But there's nothing extra, just the movie with an option for 5.1 digital and subtitles.  So all in all I definetly say that Juice is a top notch movie in it's genre, probably one of the best.  Besides the lack of features on the DVD, the movie undoubtibly sells itself.

463007,5,630244327X,"This is a engaging film about getting respect or ""juice"", albeit being the wrong way. ""Juice"" is about four buddies (Omar Epps, Tupac Shakur, Khalil Kain, Jermaine Hopkins) whose lives are torn apart when one of them get ahold of a gun, convinces his friends to join him in robbing a local bodega, and accidently kills the proprietor. That starts a horrific chain of events when certain people end up getting shot, including two of the four friends, all at the hand of Bishop (Tupac Shakur). Although I was not much of a fan of Tupac Shakur's music, I really loved him as an actor. His intensity in the role of Bishop in ""Juice"" was powerful. He was truly chilling, especially when he theatens Quincy aka ""Q"" (Omar Epps) in a school hallway and tells him, ""I AM crazy, but you know what? I don't give a $#@*!"" Then he proceeds to tell Q that he doesn't care about anyone, not even himself because he knows that he's no good. Whoa!!! In his mind, being a thug was his way of getting respect. Tupac, no doubt, would have gone on to become one of the greatest young dramatic actors of our time. It's such a tragedy that he was taken from us, but thank God we still have Pac to watch on video.

Omar Epps, aside from being nice eye candy, gives a great performance as well as ""Q"", the kid who loves music and has big dreams of becoming a professional DJ. This is the way he wants to obtain respect, and rightfully so. ""Q"" is torn between being loyal to his friends and going to the police when Bishop's homicidial behavior gets dangerously out of control. Ultimately he decides that he has to be the one to stop Bishop, but at the same time he fears for his own life. Look for En Vogue member Cindy Herron in a role as Omar's older girlfriend. I really enjoyed this movie and after owning it for years on VHS, I'm finally getting the DVD. An excellent film to watch that teaches hard lessons about following along with a crowd.

463008,5,630244327X,"In other words, don't start getting ridiculous, going crazy and all, like Tupac's best character ever, the one he came to maybe live out, some would say.  Pac's performance is truly amazing, let's not forget, he was a  trained actor before he even got into hip hop, so this maybe shouldn't be  SO surprising, but for the fact that he hits it so well because, well, it's  him.  This is Omar Epps first movie (I think) as well, and he was  excellent, as was the guys who played Rahim and Steel.  The movie is great  and well shot, with excellent music throughout.  It's primarily the story  of a dj (Epps), really, just trying to get on, and his friends, and the  possibilities that can erupt in every man's struggle for respect.  Never  mind the critics, they seem to critique all black movies the same.  This  film is unique.  It's NOT that violent, especially in the day of Quentin  Tarantino or even Menace II Society. There's cameos by tons of rappers,  including Special Ed, EPMD, Latifah, Naughty by Nature, and others.  But  they're small and inconsequential roles for the most part (as they should  be). Don't watch this movie as any commentary on Harlem or on black youths  or any of that trash. Only racists try to generalize and make every movie  that a black person makes into an all-encompassing Statement of Reality.  It's overall a somewhat fun movie with a strong bite to it.  And it's got a  classic soundtrack, the first of the many rap soundtracks that would come  out with every movie after this. It's perfect, not too ambitious, doesn't  try too hard, isn't a real ""tear jerker"" though it can be  touching.  Overall, I'd say its a classic and ten years later, its still as  enjoyable.",960336000,70,1704,4.59866220735786
