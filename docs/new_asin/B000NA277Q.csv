8176476,3,B000NA277Q,"okay i use taebo workouts about 4 days per week. ive been doing taebo videos for about a year now, so mission 1 is too easy for me. i like mission 2. billy and the team uses billy bands during the workout but i use free weights. i never like using the bands because they bother me. but the workout is just as good using free weights. i am not too crazy about mission 3 which is an ab workout. i don't think its challenging enough. however, if you are more of a beginner, these workouts are good for you. don't be alarmed by the word ""elite"", if you are a beginner, these workouts might be a little more of a challenge for you, but its most likely something you can handle or work up to.",1359504000,2,686,4.051470588235294
8176477,3,B000NA277Q,"Only have done Mission 1 and not as hard as I thought it would be.  Will have to buy an exercise band and then it might be harder.  I am a lover of Taebo from the old ""Live"" series but just getting back into it.",1355097600,,211,3.6666666666666665
