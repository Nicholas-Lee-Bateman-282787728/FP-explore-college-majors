2382841,4,B000AA4FAQ,"This is a great movie highlighting all that Scandinavia has to offer in the guns, girls, and gore department.  Unfortunately this version of the movie is edited to exclude the hardcore scenes of the star and her clients.  This does not detract from the viewing experience.  The over the top plot dialog and action make Thriller a great movie worthy of Tarantino's praise (check Rolling Stone December 2006 for his exact words).  THIS IS WORTH A WATCH BUT IT IS EDITED TO EXCLUDE HARDCORE SCENES YOU HAVE HEARD ABOUT.",1174262400,6,516,4.764044943820225
2382842,1,B000AA4FAQ,"Cult classic???  I think not!  This was by far one of the worse movies I've ever seen.  This movie is WAY over-rated.  Terrible acting, even for a 70's movie, with very stupid and annoying music.  It jumped all over the place in a nonsensical manner.  It had a fairly decent plot and could have been done so much better.  Don't waste your money on this one.  Anyone looking to purchase out of curiosity, go to eBAY and buy mine.  I'm listing it for a buck.  I've had it 1 day and it's going on the block.  Definitely not something I'll every watch again.",1136678400,10,554,4.281553398058253
2382843,3,B000AA4FAQ,"I picked up the Vengeance Edition of Thriller today and watched it pretty much right after I got back from the store.  While I enjoyed it, and think there's a lot to offer in this low budget film, I am a little confused about people talking about gore and brutality.  I can only assume there must be quite a bit cut from this version other than the before-mentioned hardcore sex scenes, like him actually cutting out her eye, where in this version, you only see him with the blade right up at her eyeball and then it goes to the next scene.  I'm curious to see a more complete version of the movie now, as this version seems to be very hacked and re-pieced together to make a more ""U.S. Friendly"" release.  In the meantime, it standso n it's own as a good movie with a little cheese and too many slo-mo scenes during the gun and other fights.  Clockwork Orange it ain't, but I'm still glad I watched it.

I've now learned that there's a red cover edition that is completely uncut.  I'm not sure if the movie is worth buying a second copy, although I'm extremely tempted...",1127174400,3,1072,4.35678391959799

 People who declared it a real movie because of a percieved meaningful social message need to get out more. Bugs Bunny cartoons were more realistic and showed more talent.",1319155200,2,398,5.03030303030303

The cruel picture version is entirely uncut and the one of the two worth checking out. Eitherway, though this film was ahead of its time and paved the way for many of the revenge films that followed I thought it was worth watching but not owning and give the unedited version three stars. They call her one eye I give 2 1/2 stars",1284076800,10,482,4.3076923076923075
8076648,3,B000AA4FAQ,"Like many folks I bought this because I'd read that Quentin Tarantino was a big advocate of this film. Now I love Switchblade Sisters another Quentin fave but thought that Rolling Thunder was overrated. Luckily I'd say that Thriller is more akin to Sisters than Thunder. I won't go crazy writing about the details of this film as it's pretty cut and dry. It's a female gets revenge on those who abused her mostly males film. I agree with those that say it's not as over the top violent or sadistic as I Spit On Your Grave the nadir of these type films. It does have it's good points one being the lovely Christina Lindberg as the avenging one eyed hooker turned assassin. I've seen her work before most notable as Anita the misunderstood nympho in the film of the same name. She does great as far as conveying the characters feelings without ever uttering a word. Some don't like the slow motion kill scenes but I found them to look great. The effects of the gunshot wounds looked awesome way more believable than the CGI crapolla out there today. You can see where Quentin got the idea for Hannah's eye patch in the Kill Bill films as well as where he came up with the vivid kill scenes when the Bride wipes out the Crazy 88's. I hear that there are 2 cuts of the film available one with hardcore porn and one edited out. Reminds me of the films of Joe D'Amato who often added sex just for the hell of it to his films. I got the yellow Vengeance version sans porn so I can't comment on the quality of that material. In closing if films like Last House on the Left,MS.45,I Spit on Your Grave and others intrest you then I recommend this it's flawed but quite watchable.",1257724800,2,1669,4.352564102564102

8076650,4,B000AA4FAQ,"I had heard so many great things about Thriller. How gruesome it is, and brutaly violent. I believe it was Tarantino who once said it was th roughest revenge movie ever made. Now, when I watched this movie I kept this things in mind, a very open mind. Some may see these things as false, because the writing is very poor, with next to no dialogue most of which doesn't make sense. i.e. ""Hey... I bet you don't have one good reason why you shouldn't take a ride in my car."" And the girl agrees!!! The action is also very minimal, bu take into consideration that it is a low budget film.

Now, on the other hand, this movies entire premise is EXTREMELY dark and violent, even for now adays standards. So yes it is very brutal in context.

The bottom line: This movie isn't for every one. If your looking for something gruesome, or action packed then this is not your movie. However if you a Grindhouse officionado, have an open mind, or just love an interesting concept that takes some though to realy appreciate, grab Thriller. ""They saw her one eye, turned, and ran.""",1192492800,,1067,4.438775510204081
