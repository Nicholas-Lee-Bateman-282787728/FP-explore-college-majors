8074442,3,B000A59PRY,"I enjoyed the upbeat message of Escape by Night, and Dean Jagger in a minor role with hair was so young and evil; but the print is in poor shape. Gangster's Boy has a suburban high school setting, a time capsule. The Big Combo is a classic, and an excellent print. Scott Brady in Port of New York; his brother, noir-star Lawrence Tierney, not the only Tierney brother to deliver the thespian goods.

The quality of the prints ranges from excellent to poor. Many of these flickers seem not to be available from Mill Creek yet, so this is the best deal you may find. I bought mine used from an Amazon Seller for $3.29 + s&h. Not a bad deal for a nice handful of curios. 16 decent movies, and all-around fun, this is interesting entertainment. If this is the sort of thing you like, then you will like this.

And how about those movie studios?! Producers Releasing Corporation wasn't half bad, for a poverty row studio.

Here now is details.
