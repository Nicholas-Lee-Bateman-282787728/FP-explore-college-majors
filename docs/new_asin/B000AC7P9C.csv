8077752,1,B000AC7P9C,This was not at all what I thought it was. I was expecting it to be a documentary about the haunted queen Mary ship but instead it was an infomercial about a cruise.,1414454400,,165,4.03030303030303
8077753,1,B000AC7P9C,"Don't waste your time or money on this tape. This production is something you might see in a college level TV class. It is disjointed, confused, with amateur production values. Now that all aside, I still would of found it tolerable, if it wasn't for the fact the narrator has the most annoying and irrritable tone of voice, I have ever heard! I can't remember one person to person, interview on board. and the tape doesnt know if it's main subject is the QM2, or the cheesy 70's like footage of RIO.  Do not purchase this, there are other tapes available on each subject matter, with much higher production quality!",1350259200,2,616,4.6
