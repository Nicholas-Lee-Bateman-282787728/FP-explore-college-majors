5002623,4,B006LA7KTM,This workout is fun but it repeats itself enough so you can catch on to the moves.  It's a fun way to get in your daily cardio!,1337299200,,127,3.7037037037037037
5002624,5,B006LA7KTM,"I have many workout videos and this one is my favorite. It is fun, fast-paced, the music is great, you really feel like you are dancing in a club and not working out (except for sore muscles the next day). It was hard to follow the first few days but once you get used to fast moves it is a breeze. I have tried many ways to exercise but I usually get bored easily. This one never seems to get boring.",1335916800,,401,3.962962962962963
5002625,5,B006LA7KTM,THIS IS AN AWESOME WORKOUT. I AM A DANCER & WAS CONCERNED THAT THE STEPS WOULD BE BASIC. IT'S WELL CHOREOGRAPHED & HAS A GREAT VARIETY OF STEPS. SHE IS AN EXCELLENT INSTRUCTOR & I AM COMPLETELY THRILLED WITH THIS WORKOUT.,1330732800,6,221,4.414634146341464
5002626,4,B006LA7KTM,"I took Jazzercise classes for years.  I love the choreography and the cueing of the moves.  This workout is fun, but the class environment is better. I would prefer more current and ""popular"" music.",1330387200,2,198,4.794117647058823
5002627,4,B006LA7KTM,"A real workout but fun.  The gals are young and energetic while I am 73, however, I am working on it.",1329782400,5,101,3.8095238095238093
5002628,5,B006LA7KTM,"My husband knows how much I love jazzercise and surprised me with this DVD! The music is great (popular stuff) and the moves are much more dancy than the other Jazzercise DVDs. There's definitely some sexy moves incorporated into the workout, but Shanna does emphasize technique and focusing on muscle groups, so you won't forget that this is definitely a workout!

Someone mentioned the intro was boring, but I thought it was just a nice, good stretch routine that was only about 5 minutes long. The workouts are more fast-paced and fun, and there are 8 instructors that are dancing along with her, which was pretty cool. If this is your first Jazzercise DVD, just wanted to let you know they only wore that much makeup and sexy clothes for this Burlesque workout! :D

I also have Ballet Body, Jazzercise Core and Jazzercise Strength Stretch, and I enjoy rotating them and even combining the routines. I had Burlesque for 5 weeks and do this workout 1-2 times weekly along with the others. I would definitely recommend Burlesque (as well as the other DVDs!)",1328918400,7,1058,4.775956284153006
5002629,5,B006LA7KTM,Great workout and lots of fun!  I really enjoyed the dance moves.  This is probably my second favorite Jazzercise DVD after the Dancin' Abs.  Jazzercise is my favorite kind of workout!  So much fun it isn't hard at all!  (and I HATE to workout)  Can't wait to watch it again!,1328486400,11,275,4.4
5002630,5,B006LA7KTM,"This is the best dance dvd and I have many.  It's very much like a class you would do at the gym as you learn the moves as you go.  If you like Zumba classes at the gym (that play current music and not just the Latin tunes) then you will enjoy this dvd.  There is no slow break down of moves and then you finally do the full routine at the end like most dance dvd's, you learn simple, fun routines and learn them as you go at pace.  This is a great workout, fun to do, awesome music.  I hope Jazzercise comes out with a series of these Burlesque dance dvd's.  Maybe other instructors/companies will catch on that this is a type of workout that is truly lacking in the current market.  I enjoy the Zumba dvd workouts, but just get tired of the Latin music - it's a nice change to dance to songs I know and they are ""current"" not oldies or some weird electronic music you have never heard of that's cheesy or bad.  This workout will make you want to get up and dance!!!!  LOVE IT!!!",1327190400,69,980,4.0625
5002631,5,B006LA7KTM,I have most of the Jazzercise dvds and this one is by far the BEST!! I really enjoy the energy that Shanna radiates-- it's a great workout and the music is awesome-- just like a class. I highly recommend this dvd if you like to dance!!,1327017600,29,235,4.130434782608695
5002632,5,B006LA7KTM,"I had went to Zumba classes before and loved them but didn't want to pay the expensive trips for each class. So when I ran across this DVD and watched a clip of it on -[...]- I thought I would really love it. So I bought it on amazon.com and did it the first day I got it. I absolutely love it!! And I really worked up a sweat and had to stop a couple of times because I was out of breath! It's about 45 minutes long but there are so many different dances/exercises that I didn't feel like I worked out that long. It's great and would recommend it to anyone who loves to dance or who loves to just have fun and work out. I'm so glad I got this and love it! I've got other DVD's that I don't really like and are now collecting dust, but this DVD will definitely not!! 5 stars!!!!",1325203200,101,778,3.930379746835443

5002634,5,B006LA7KTM,"I was a little worried that this DVD was one of those slow paced dance DVDs,  but after 5 mins of the warmup it takes off from there. The moves are pretty basic and easy to learn after spending time getting the maneuvers right. The only thing I don't like about this DVD is that it doesnt have a good selection to customize which dances you want to do. For instance #DeniseAustin workouts gives you the option to customize. Overall this is a fantastic sexy workout with the perfect songs to shake and get ya groove on. I will be using this to lose weight for the next 3 months.",1476230400,,577,4.245454545454545

5002637,5,B006LA7KTM,I absolutely love this DVD. Shanna is a good instructor and makes it fun. Gets you sweating and feeling sexy lol,1465689600,,112,4.380952380952381
5002638,3,B006LA7KTM,"I really want to learn to dance, but when you are born with two left feet like myself that is somewhat impossible. I thought this style dance would be awesome and fun to do.

If you are a dancer  of any kind this would be great. Being someone who only has a desire to be it is tough to do. It is way more advanced and fast pace then I can ever possibly do. The pop music in the video is very upbeat and keeps you trying hard. It is a lot of fun to try but I look like something out this world while doing this. I will not do it when anyone else is home as I am very self consccience and don't want my family to laugh at me which is what would happen.

If you want a fun routine that is very challenging this is for you.",1463270400,2,719,3.748344370860927
5002639,4,B006LA7KTM,The thing that makes this video is the music. It's actually fun pop music and not just random made up exercise video music. Having music you know and like helps so much in terms of enjoying the workout and getting into the sexy moves. I totally enjoy doing it and regularly add it into my workout video rotation for something fun. The only think is it is not the hardest workout. I would say it's moderate in terms of intensity.,1461456000,,428,4.3625
5002640,5,B006LA7KTM,Was not suppose to receive this until end of month and I received it right away - I was very impressed.  The DVD works great and I will enjoy it for years to come with my workouts.  I would order from this company again!!.,1460160000,,222,4.0227272727272725
5002641,5,B006LA7KTM,"I am in perimenopause and I stopped working out 10 years ago... I've tried getting back in shape but my joints and muscle hurt so much I can't even do yaga without having too much pain. THIS video here is PERFECT!!! I've been doing the 20 minute workout to get me started slowly and OMG not only it doesn't hurt my body but it actually makes my joints and muscles feel AWESOME!!! All my joints, spine, neck, shoulders feel SOOO good everytime I do this exercise!!! This is a real life saver for me and it's FUN and energizing!!! My 5 year old daughter does it with me and everytime we have a BLAST!!! ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!!",1459987200,,622,4.3247863247863245

5002649,5,B006LA7KTM,"I absolutely LOVE this video! I bought this as a fun way to get moving and boy does it bring it! I do it with another person and we have both had to sit down after each section when we first started doing the video. I would like to skip the ""jumping"" parts as I physically wasn't ready for that. {Hurt foot/ankle}. It isn't all the way through the video which is great. I love the enthusiasm of the instructor and the ladies doing the video. Overall, this is a fun exercise dvd that makes me sweat. I am a beginner who only is able to walk three miles a day, but working up. I also purchased the Ballet Exercise DVD since several of these girls are in that as well. It is very hard for beginners, but keep doing what you can every other day. You will work up to doing it.",1448236800,,771,4.045751633986928

5002658,4,B006LA7KTM,"Enjoyed this video.  It was easy to follow the instructor's directions.  It provided a fun and adequate workout, and not an overly stressful one.",1438300800,,145,5.0
5002659,3,B006LA7KTM,"This workout is okay at best and better for beginners looking to have some fun. For moderate/advanced exercisers or anyone with dance background, skip it. It's not a complete waste of time but there are better cardio dance DVDs out there (try Christi Taylor's totally Hot Cardio. A little dated but a great, fun aerobic workout).

This is a 45 minute workout but it feels shorter because of how it's broken up. There is essentially a full 10 minute warmup and the minutes really drag early on. The first time I put the dvd in I almost wanted to stop it because I thought the whole dvd would be slow paced, but it (sort of) picks up. After the warmup there are maybe 8 mini routines, each set to a short song from the early 2000s. The moves are basic and usually more of a sexy take on an aerobic move than a true dance move. If you're getting this hoping to find moves to use in a club or at the next wedding you attend, look elsewhere. It barely gets my heart rate up so I need to really push myself to get a benefit. Usually I do this on days when I want something light and easy. The music is fun and because each routine lasts a max of 3 minutes you don't really have the time to get too bored and it seems to go by quickly. It's a good thing because there are only a few moves in each routine and some of them are very simple like ""sexy walk"" forward, shimmy walk back, repeat 8x.... If the songs were longer it would be really monotonous. After the mini routines there's an ab section and a leg section. I use those terms loosely because you're still up and dancing, but supposedly targeting these areas more. The ab section just felt like a more boring routine... It doesn't work your abs at all. If anything, it works my arms and chest more. The legs routine does a better job at targeting legs. Each of these sections is again around 3-4 minutes. Lastly there's a cool down which isn't much of a cool down because it's as much of a dance routine as any of the other sections. Fast chest pops aren't usually part of a cool down stretch. Overall, I don't see much benefit to this dvd unless you're a true beginner who needs light cardio and thinks a dance based workout is more fun than walking. I could see it being a lot of fun for some, but for others it will be too simple and boring.",1437436800,2,2295,4.204081632653061
5002660,5,B006LA7KTM,Yes this is the best DVD I have one for me but I ordered one more for my mom she likeds so much..........,1436832000,,105,3.608695652173913

I have tried other dance work out videos and this one is hands-down the BEST one that I have tried. Other dance workout videos can be boring and repetitive, but not this one. You get a really good workout and learn some really fun, sexy moves at the same time. I am someone who really enjoys Zumba classes and this DVD workout is very comparable to the intensity of a Zumba workout. If you are thinking about buying it, just do it. You won't be disappointed.",1434153600,,574,4.2272727272727275

5002671,3,B006LA7KTM,I used take dance classes which is what this reminds me of.  I feel that the instructor goes too quickly through the movements without a proper switch.  Some of the movements are a bit strange for me also.  This is my first dance workout video and maybe they are all like it.  It did get my heart pumping and it was a good workout but it just didn't feel very fluid.,1426723200,,366,4.112676056338028
5002672,5,B006LA7KTM,I did not buy this from Amazon but have had it for a few years. I love it and really started using it recently (almost daily for the last week).  It is definitely a work out...very fun. You catch on to the moves the more you do it. I do not usually sweat during workouts but this dvd haas me sweating. I started off doing the quick 20 min workout then added the 10 min abs workout and now I am doing the 40 min workout. It's my favorite workout dvd because its fun and I feel it is also helping me with my confdence and feeling sexy.,1426723200,,533,3.935185185185185

It did have a good soundtrack in the background to get you moving and grooving. It's not the usual non-vocal electronic background music.

I used to love Jazzercise when it wa on TV with Judy Misset, and the songs advertised on this DVD are great ones, but you cannot hear the music for Shanna constantly calling out the moves.

This DVD is great because you can definitely follow all the moves (if I can, then anyone can) and the music is fun and you do get a workout in.

It's one of the few DVDs that I actually don't mind doing (many of the others are enjoyable, of course, but they aren't as fun and I have to talk myself into popping those into the DVD player -- not this one). Every time I'm looking through my lengthy workout DVD collection, this is the one that I always find myself gravitating to, which is really great for all those days you don't exactly feel like working out. That being said, I am not the most coordinated person in the world and there are points that I never get right no matter how many times I do them (overall I'd say the steps are pretty easy), but if you're focusing on having fun while working out instead of doing everything exact, you'll really enjoy this.",1406505600,,857,4.3625

I've used it for more than two weeks now at around four times a week, and it still makes me work up a sweat every time.  As others have mentioned, Shanna is an awesome instructor as she explains the moves very well.  The background music is awesome and really put me in the mood to workout; I literally caught myself singing (more like out of breath muffles) while doing the steps.  This is my first Jazzercise DVD but if the others are like this one, I'm definitely buying more!!

this is hardly a work out. i can't seem to get my heart rate up no matter how much i work the moves.

the abs? pointless.
the leg exercises are okay.

Moves at a good pace, flows well, not real intense, but still a good cardio workout. All in all as fun as a workout can be. Cardio Dance in the DWTS series comes in 2nd. Shaun T's fat burning cardio also has a place in my cardio rotation. I am 58 and in reasonably good shape, these are doable workouts for me without modifying.

I'm training for my first burlesque performance . There are many moves that I will be able to use on stage. I lost 3 lbs doing this workout twice this week , and I was still eating the same crap I usually do. I figure if I use it every day , or at least 4 times a week I will lose more. Its a win win win for me, low cost, great for losing weight and helps me to learn moves. The added bonus is that it has music from a few years back that reminds me of when I was younger, Pussycat Doll, Britney, Lady Marmalade etc . My 11 y.o. daughter found it so entertaining , she put down her tablet and got up and did the workout with me ! That was awesome because it was a great bonding moment and she got some exercise too.

I'm a get-up-early-in-the-morning-and-workout-before-the-day-starts person, so after my banana and cup of coffee, the idea of doing a workout DVD that I dread is not fun. In the case of this Jazzercise routine, I think I'll be excited to get up and knock this one out. I've seen some people on here complain that the choreography moves too quickly, but I highly disagree. Not to be mean, but maybe for beginners to working out or really uncoordinated people this might be true, but I had no problems at all. There was maybe one move that tripped me up a bit, but the instructor repeats it so many times that if a certain move is giving you problems, you can probably get the hang of it before too long.

The music on here is great...just upbeat, fun dance music. I was a little leery of the BURLESQUE title because I thought it might be highly sexualized and low on the actual working out content, but I thought the balance between sexiness and actual dancing was perfect. Also, I appreciated the different body types represented by all the Jazzercise dancers.

1. The best thing about it is that it has actual real music I'd want to listen to. They are sort of lame covers of songs I know, but at least they are songs I like, and not just cheesy techno beats for five hours.

2. It may not be burlesque technically, but duh, what burlesque dance would be a workout??? They take some basic burlesque moves/attitudes and put it into a dance. It's really simple dance routines that ANYONE can master seriously. Plus you can kind of be sassy, and who doesn't like being sassy??? you know you want to. that's the whole reason we are working out in the first place. so people will want to sleep with us.  so this is good practice at being sexy. hip swivel. oh yeah.

3. this is fun.  ive never been excited about working out. i coudnt wait to get this in the mail because i saw a preview online and it's even better than i thought.  i literally can't wait to do this every day.

This a great workout that doesn't really feel like a workout.,1390003200,,327,4.2063492063492065
5002769,5,B006LA7KTM,"I hate exercising more than almost anything. I do not work out at gyms or run. My normal exercise is walking the dog twice a day. When we moved to a place where dog walking is dangerous (due to many large, loose dogs) I started playing with the dog in the backyard for his exercise. I felt like I needed something I could do to keep in shape so I ordered this tape because I enjoy dancing.

I like this tape. There are 3 different routines, (10 minute, 20 minute, and 45 minute). They are each different and fairly balanced, so you don't feel way more worn out with the longer one than you do with the shorter ones. I feel stretched out and exercised, but the routines are not too strenuous. You will need enough room to do the routine (there are forward and side step parts), I use the living room area behind the couch. The music is fun. After you do each routine a few times you can learn the steps and focus on control for better stretching.

This tape is well worth it if you want an interesting, moderate workout. You are out of breath but I doubt most people would suffer a strain.",1390003200,5,1088,4.225961538461538
5002770,4,B006LA7KTM,"I got this to do on the days when I just don't have the energy for Insanity. That being said, it is definitely not as intense, but I still sweat and feel like I've done a decent workout. The workout combines traditional aerobics moves with fun sexy burlesque moves. I would have given it five stars but the routine can be a little hard to follow and doesn't get much explanation from the instructor.",1389916800,4,399,4.405405405405405
5002771,1,B006LA7KTM,"Is easier to dance on my own than follow this dance moves that are all over the place . You either have them going to fast and make no sense when switching into positions . I love amazon , they gave me my money back and I didn't even have to returned it at all . I just want people to know that if you order just make sure that you know some kind of stripper dancing . I have 2 kids and just made me uncomfortable seeing this video . Very unclassy and distasteful . I used to go clubbing back n the day and have some moves but would never do a this type video again . I rather do JUST DANCE 3.",1389571200,,593,3.752

Music is awful
Routines are fine, but totally lacking the energy from the live classes with better music. Expected much more from this particular disc- great opportunity lost to lame music. Needs to offer version with no music if they are going to use such lacking tracts",1386028800,,294,4.9
5002775,5,B006LA7KTM,I love it! it is a fun and exciting work out. It only took me a day or two to really start picking up the moves. And she is really good at letting you know what is going to happen next its awesome!,1384905600,,197,3.604651162790698

5002777,5,B006LA7KTM,"Great workout--even the express (shorter) option gets the blood pumping, and the instructor moves from one segment to another before I get bored. Though this isn't usually my sort of workout, I borrowed the DVD from my library and liked it so much, I purchased it. The burlesque-style moves help loosen muscles that get too tight with running and other, more repetitive activities.",1384387200,,381,5.063492063492063
5002778,5,B006LA7KTM,"This is a fun and engaging workout.  And if you put on your skimpy workout clothes, you feel kinda sexy and like you are auditioning for the chorus line!  The steps are not too complicated, and it only took me a weeks practice to learn the routine.

There are three work-outs to chose: a full session,a 20 minute quick work-out and a 10 min Ab/Butt session.  It is well done and a great work-out when you can't get to the gym.",1383177600,,309,4.368421052631579
5002780,4,B006LA7KTM,"Girls night! A cousin (early thirties with a bad knee), a sister (early 20's), a mom (early 50's and would rather lay down and lift a book to read as a workout) and myself (early 20's with two left feet) all got together and had a blast with this one. I won't lie it went kind of fast at times, but we'd just make up our own moves because the music on here is current and motivating like the Pussycat Dolls Don't Cha- not just the music but with actual singing! Also,certain moves may have to be improvised if you can't take pressure on certain joints but for the most part anyone can do this. Mom, who usually doesn't want to do anything with a lot of movement does this by herself now even. I was going to get the Zumba fitness workout dvd, but someone suggested trying this one first before making the investment. I'm glad I did! Jazzercise is challenging enough and has a lot of similar dance styles as the Zumba does...hip thrusting, salsa, quick steps, booty popping, shimmying, and lot's of other moves that could actually work on a real dance floor. I need to master these sexy moves before moving on to Zumba or anything else. Can't wait until next week when we whip up some skinny cocktails, squeeze our curves into some spandex, and do it all over again!",1382313600,7,1265,4.3872340425531915
5002781,5,B006LA7KTM,"I have stayed away from ""Burlesque"" exercise dvds because they seemed cheesy and to low in intensity for my taste.  However, I started noticing a trend of reviewers with similar taste to me giving this a high review so I decided to give it a try and I am glad I did.  With the exception of the fact that the instructor gives verbal cueing this reminds me of the Zumba classes I take at my gym where my instructor uses contemporary songs.  The instructor is Jazzercise President Shanna Missett Nelson and I find her to be a very good instructor.  The choreography is dead on for me - not to easy to be boring but not so difficult that you are standing there scratching your head. As other reviewers have pointed out this is more sassy hip hop than burlesque but that is besides the point.  The point is to have fun while burning calories.  I wore a heart rate monitor and in 32 min I burned 476 calories.  The 32 minutes was the cardio portion only and I may have repeated one song twice because I was having fun.  My only complaint is the intensity slows down right when I am getting into cardio zone so whenever I have used this dvd I have found myself using another dance routine afterwards to get over 40 minutes of cardio.

Note: Jazzercise has released Dance Hiit which has a premix which after the 5 minute warm-up is 25 minutes of cardio that is perfect add on to this dvd for those who want longer cardio.",1381708800,17,1413,4.321969696969697
5002782,3,B006LA7KTM,Its okay.  But I don't use it that much. You have to like to dance. Focus on the core is central to this workout,1380931200,3,112,3.6666666666666665
5002783,4,B006LA7KTM,"Not a strenuous workout but can give you a decent cardio push. The instructor was very upbeat and engaging.
It was easy to follow with Shanna giving you time to learn the move before adding on

5002784,2,B006LA7KTM,"Jazzercise classes are great fun and a great workout.  I bought this to take on a trip where I wouldn't be able to attend class.  The workout itself is okay.  Here's what bothered me:

1)  The music is NOT the original artists.  It's studio versions.  Hearing anyone other than Pitbull say he's ""Mr. Worldwide"" just isn't working for me.
2)  The girls dancing behind her are Stepford scary.  They have these big giant fake smiles plastered on their faces the entire time.  Who exercises like that?  And apparently, they're not allowed to make a sound (no encouragements, whoops, or anything to indicate they're enjoying themselves).
3)  Jazzercise is constantly having to defend its brand and convince people that it is not the cheesy jazzercise of the 70s and 80s that is spoofed on SNL.  They WHY, for the love of God, does the President look like she belongs in 1987?  Cheesy permed/teased hair, orange fake tan, etc.  And most of the girls also look very dated.

I think I'd rather just put on some music and dance around myself.",1379289600,12,1033,4.687150837988827

The moves can be difficult because it is fast paced, but after doing the video a couple of times, I caught on well. My only complaint about this video is that it does jump around a bit and there are too many people in it. They are all close together and so if you are trying to learn a move, it can be a bit distracting. However, that does not take away from the fun I had doing it. If you are a decent dancer, you should have no problem. If you are a beginner, stick with it and you should be able to pick it up with practice.",1365552000,,733,4.027397260273973

I love class and find this disc as a nice supplement to live classes.  It comes in handy when the weather is bad or I don't get out of work early enough to get to class.  The songs on here are fun and sassy!  I find the cuing on the discs helpful to get better form and target muscles more accurately to get the most out of the exercise.  I have attended other classes where there is little to no cuing which can put a customer at risk for injury.  The cues help minimize that risk which is great! I have also found that I feel the physical benefits of exercise routines with cues as opposed to those without as I can focus in on the targeted muscle groups rather than floating through the movements.

Best jazzercise DVD to date.,1363046400,2,351,4.333333333333333
5002832,5,B006LA7KTM,It is like dancing but actually working out.  I would purchase again and totally recommend for anyone who loves jazzersi,1362960000,,120,5.0

5002834,4,B006LA7KTM,I would recommend this to anyone who likes dancing. The only disappointment was I thought it would have the music from the movie which I enjoyed so much.,1362700800,,153,4.5
5002835,5,B006LA7KTM,"I have been doing Jazzercise for nearly 20 years.  We don't have a class available where I live now so I was missing it bigtime.  This DVD is just like class.  The moves are easy but sassy and just enough dance to make it a lot of fun. The 20 minute workout is great when you don't have time to do the whole thing.
I can't wait to purchase another Jazzercise DVD",1362355200,,362,4.0
5002836,4,B006LA7KTM,"A former student of Jazzercise, as I am, will probably be very disappointed. It's a workout but more self-aggrandizement for the instructors than is admirable.",1362182400,,159,5.4

5002838,5,B006LA7KTM,"Jazzercise: Burlesque is one of the best exercise DVD's I've come across! It's high-intensity, targets different body areas, and is so much fun! If you love to dance (like I do), this is a must buy! Highly recommended! I only wish she had more DVD's like these to buy. :)",1360972800,,271,4.44
5002839,4,B006LA7KTM,"This exercise dvd is fantastic! I have only done the 20 minute session and the ab session...haven't had time to do the full length workout yet. It really gets my heart rate up and the moves are fairly easy.  I am not a dancer and have no dance background, but I still find the instruction is easy to follow. The music is upbeat and current.  Highly recommend this! I would give it 5 stars if there was a few more sessions available...but for under $13, it is a good deal.",1360886400,,471,4.222222222222222
5002840,5,B006LA7KTM,"I know I shouldn't be doing a review yet because I haven't done the entire video, but I did some of the first workout (until my knees hurt so bad I had to go back to my kettlebells) and I did the third section (Ab & Booty Blast-10 minute) yesterday after I'd done kettlebells.  This workout leaves me sweating like crazy, but also wanting to keep going.  It's a lot of fun but the burning makes me have to stop!  I am in fairly good shape but WOW!  You will get a workout!  (And the Britney fan in me just says YES to this workout!) I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!",1360886400,,569,3.9130434782608696
5002841,5,B006LA7KTM,"I love dance dvds and this is one of the best I have ever done! The instructor is excellent with your cues to change the steps are clear and the music is not so loud that her voice can not be heard! The movements are fun and make nice dance routines. One routine is not all that long so the different moves go on and on. They are done in a set of reps so anyone can get the routines down and then will go onto the next! I also love the updated music! Good choices that make you want to get up and move! When I get ready to do this dvd I'm looking forward to it because it is so much fun and not like workingout,,,I look forward to it! If you are a jazzercise beginner or someone that has done it for many years I think this would be a great addition to your collection!",1360540800,,769,3.8734177215189876
5002842,4,B006LA7KTM,"I am a terrible dancer and this workout left me drenching in sweat.  I am not sure if it would be as difficult if you have history with dance or not.  For me, I have a long way to go before I can get everything perfect, which is good because it gives  me something to work toward, but also not as good because I'm probably not getting as good of a workout in some areas.  All in all, I like it, especially since it has 2 Britney songs! :)",1360368000,,438,3.8876404494382024
5002843,3,B006LA7KTM,"I'm a little disappointed in the the speed that Shanna breezes through these instructions. Even her ""slow"" girl is just whipping right through them. I HIGHLY recommend that you sit down and watch the workouts first before trying to do them. Also, not really sure where there is burlesque dancing. All I saw was more modified 'club/workout' dances. I just wish there was more burlesque moves.",1360281600,8,391,4.9393939393939394
5002844,4,B006LA7KTM,"This DVD was an impulse purchase as I usually am an outdoor runner and I needed winter boredom busters. It's fun, high-energy, and combined with some weight training it's probably a pretty good workout for the day. The moves aren't anything you'll be tempted to use outside of your own home, and the music isn't really my taste, but if you don't take it too seriously, it's really a fun way to get moving when sub-zero temps have you house bound!",1360108800,,446,4.518518518518518

5002848,5,B006LA7KTM,"Jazzercise rocks and this DVD does not disappoint!  Super fun and sexy...what more could you want from a workout?  It has three workouts:  the regular jazzercise workout, a 20 min express workout and a 10 min butt and abs only.  Perfect!  Fit it in with your schedule no matter how much time you have to spare each day.",1358899200,,319,4.431034482758621

5002853,5,B006LA7KTM,"I love this DVD.  The music is fun, the instructor is motivating and the girls are not all perfect, it is just like a class.  The fact that you can choose the 20 minute workout along with the 10 minute toning workout is great for someone just starting out.  The moves are easy to follow and there are not so many that you cant keep up.  I like the repetition as it makes it much easier to catch onto the steps.  I have bad knees so I modify on the moves that require pivoting but other than that it is an awesome video and the 20 minute workout really makes me sweat. Sweat= an increased metablolism.  I am unable to get through the 45 minute workout just yet, but even that appears to be for someone in beginner-intermediate range.  IMO if you are a hard corp Gym Rat this may be too easy for you.",1357776000,2,798,4.109677419354838
5002854,5,B006LA7KTM,"I have been doing dance workouts for years and this is by far one of the best!  They are fun moves that really get your heart rate up.  One of the biggest complaints about dance workouts is that even though I have fun, I don't feel that I am getting a very good workout, with this DVD this is not the case.  I am in great shape and I was sweating 10 mins into this video.  I highly recommend this workout!! I'm so happy that added it to my collection!",1357084800,5,451,3.977777777777778

5002857,4,B006LA7KTM,"I love exercising at home and have a ton of workout DVDs.  I prefer cardio ones that allow me to let loose and do some dancing.  This one is fairly good and about 1/3 of the way in my heart gets really pumping.  However, this is not nearly as fun as the Dancin Abs one that Jazzercise puts out.  There are some fun tunes and moves, but they are a little repetitive and there is a lot of the ""sexy walk"".  This continues to be a regular in my cycle of videos to exercise to.",1354752000,2,473,3.9368421052631577

5002859,4,B006LA7KTM,"I have been in Jazzercise for over 1 year. AND I love it!! I wanted to get the DVD to do more at home and this looked like fun!! It is alot of fun. I love the dance moves. I can follow along pretty good because I already know what she is talking about because we do all the same moves in Jazz right now. I was a bit confused about the DVD because it lists 3 options, one ab&booty blast 10min, 1 quick 20 min work out and one burlesque total dance section. THE 20 min work out and burlesque total dance ARE THE SAME. THE DVD lists 77min of work out, when in fact there is 30min....thats the only downside to me, I would rather have had more dance moves in a new section for 30min.
ALL in all a great DVD just not enough time in it for me, I want more JAZZ :)",1354752000,,757,3.828025477707006
5002860,5,B006LA7KTM,Loved this workout video from Jazzercise!  It is one of the best workout videos I've purchased.  The workouts are divided into sections that are easy to follow with great music.

5002862,4,B006LA7KTM,"I am middle-aged, usually do walking exercise DVDs (Sansonne), and get bored easily.  Since I am also somewhat out of shape, I chose to do the quick workout first.  There are 4 short routines which are fun to do and the moves easy to learn. But.....it is very fast. You start off with a very nice and unique warm-up and from that point on there is no slowing down. I've only been able to complete 2 of the 4 routines - not because they are difficult to follow but I'm more out of shape than I thought. My advice, if you are new to this kind of dance workout, watch the routines first and try out a move or more at your own pace until you feel you've got it down. I jumped right in and tried to keep up with the pace while doing moves that I never had done before.  I ended up with a slight strain in my lower back because of bad form.  All in all, a fun workout with good background music and motivating instructor.",1348099200,70,915,4.066666666666666

5002867,5,B006LA7KTM,"So I just used this CD today for the first time even though I bought it some months back. Why? This was one of the CD's I bought and went why did I even buy this just based on the pictures of the three bimbo like looking females on the CD. So basically I had very low expectation of the DVD and decided to try it today because I was feeling lazy and needed something that was not challenging at all. Boy!!!!! Was I wrong!!!!!!!.... Within moments I was sweating profusely and totally loving the moves and beats...... To cut my story short, I went from feeling like -0.0000000001 to feeling over a 100% after I got through the workout. It is fun, a little flirty and they used real live music. Actually after I got through the CD, I went on the search for more jazzercise workout DVD's. Loveeeeeeee This!!!!! Buy it, you will not be disappointed!!!!!",1342742400,55,849,4.379746835443038

5002869,5,B006LA7KTM,"I have been a jazzerciser on and off for about 10 years and I LOVE this DVD! I have been to live classes, but can't afford it right now and I was getting a little tired of my PURE Jazzercise DVD which I have had for about 5 years since I can do it with my eyes closed!

Anyway, I love this DVD for the following reasons:

Music: I love that there is a variety of songs, many of which are popular/well known so its fun to sing along and dance to. (Pussycat Dolls- Don't cha, Britney Spears- I'm a slave for you, Lady Marmalade, etc.) There is also a jazzy 1920's song, and a latin song or two and some other songs that I like but don't know singers and titles! lol

Routines: The routines are really fun and I love that they are a little sexier than traditional Jazzercise. Who doesn't love to shake their hips? lol Each routine has its traditional Jazzercise moves (ball change, triplet, tango, etc.) though no ""attitude"" which is one of my favorite moves! lol and of course its easy to get the routine pattern down once you have done the workout a few times.

Workout Breakdown: You start out with a warm-up to lightly stretch and get your heart going, then its about 30 minutes of cardio routines, then an abs routine (I don't really feel too much of an ab workout though), then a legs/lower body routine which I find effective, then a cool down/stretch routine. (For me, I think the body needs a more thorough stretch so I do my own after the DVD is over) There is also a 20 minute quick-workout option (which is first 20 minutes of the original workout) and a abs and legs toning option (which is last part of the workout).

Instructor: Its Shanna, Jazzercise president and Judy Jazzercise's daughter. I love her! She is a good instructor (I love Judy, but she can be a little annoying) and its motivating to watch her and the other ladies in the workout in their cute outfits with their amazing bodies!

I am so glad I bought this DVD! I have had it for 3 weeks now and do it several times a week. Its such a fun workout! Highly recommended!",1341792000,2,2046,4.301298701298701

 I bought it to supplement the classes I go to a few times a week. This video was very similar in style to the classes, but with new music and some newer moves. A lot of hip and booty shaking. Nothing to scandalous. All in all I am pleased with the product, at a very reasonable price. I would say if you like the video try out a class, they are 10 times better because of the instructor participation.",1338336000,,609,3.9836065573770494

8500310,5,B006LA7KTM,This is a excellent workout DVD!  I took it to work for my co-workers to do!  We have 30 minutes we use instead of eating lunch...we workout with the 20 minute workout.  Just the 20 minute give us energy to finish the day and walk to the train station and the parking home at the end of the day.  One of my co-worker is a ice-skater and this helps her loosen up before rehearsal!. The hip stretches at the beginning are great especially since we've been sitting most of the day. I like it when home...I've been dancing since age 7!  Shanna is easy to follow...her instructions are right before needed which make it easy to follow her.  The full workout of the DVD gives even the novice a feel for dance because of the stops at the end of each dance/song.  We also watched the movie and the moves in the DVD are some of the ones in the movie!!!  Soooo... we BURLESQUE at work!!,1479686400,,876,4.234939759036145
