7988762,3,B000092WA5,"Released in 1958 and shot in B&W, Earth vs. the Spider details the events of a small town in Southern California when a colossal spider living in a cave comes to town.

While Earth vs. the Spider is great when you're 8 years-old its flaws surface when viewed as an adult. For one, the spiders size changes according to the sequence: In the cave its huge, but when its on display at the school its noticeably smaller; then when it traverses the town its gargantuan. Inconsistencies like this don't make for great movies. Its entertaining in some ways, like being a period piece of the late 50s, but it pales in comparison to Sci-Fi giants from the 50s like The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) and the monumental Forbidden Planet (1956). It doesnt help that colossal animal/monster movies made in the decades since are just all-around better, including being in color. Still, Earth vs. the Spider is worth catching if you favor these kinds of flicks and want to go back in time to the late 50s, not to mention there are some effective elements, like the horrific sounds the spider makes and the drained remains of its victims.

The film runs 73 minutes and was shot in Bronson Canyon, Griffith Park and Los Angeles, California, with additional footage from Carlsbad Caverns National Park.

7988763,2,B000092WA5,"EARTH VS. THE SPIDER is one of those 1950s movies that ran on a double bill at the drive in theatre--with the title and the posters more memorable than the movie itself.

The story is trivial.  Carol (June Kenney) has a father given to going off on a toot, so when he doesn't show up at home on time she is the only one worried.  She pesters her boyfriend Mike (Eugene Persson) into helping her look for him, and by chance they find her father's car wrecked near a mysterious cave.  Quite naturally they have a peek inside, where they discover a gigantic web-spinning, man-eating tralantula.  The creature is dosed up with enough DDT to kill an elephant, presumed dead, and moved to the highschool gymn to await pick up by a university.  Unfortunately, the school rock and roll band wants to rehearse, and their beat awakens the spider, which was only stunned.  Surprise!

This is the sort of movie where people leave one place at night, drive a short distance, and arrive in broad daylight.  The rearview projections and split screens and such are very, very obvious, and although some of the movie seems to have been shot at Carlsbad Caverns, most of the spider shots are done on pasteboard cut outs and minature mock ups.  Even the spider's web--and tralantualas don't spin webs--looks like a cargo net.  If this sounds like it's good for a giggle, well, no, not really.  Frankly, the spider moves faster than the movie, which is slow, has a head-shaking script, and makes you want to hit the fast forward time and time again.

Now and then you come across a bad movie that's entertaining in a goofy sort of way, but most bad movies are just bad movies, and EARTH VS. THE SPIDER is of the latter variety.  If you're a hardcore fan of 1950s big bug movies, knock yourself out.  It isn't as bad as TEENAGERS FROM OUTER SPACE, but it makes TRALANTULA look like a major A movie in comparison.
