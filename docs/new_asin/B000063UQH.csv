7959755,2,B000063UQH,"This event is full of top-notch fighters but there is little worth seeing here.  Much of this fight card consists of hugging and laying on the mat, and for me it was hard to resist fast forwarding through some parts of the fights.  After the second or third fight, it's decision after decision, with little action or progress in the fights.  Near the end of the card, I think it's the third to last fight, Bas Rutten even loses his patience and says ""I hope this fight...isn't the same...as the last one.""  He doesn't get his wish.

I don't mind fights that take place mostly on the ground or in the clinch and go to a decision, as long as there is some effort from both fighters.  I don't need the highlight reel knockouts and submissions to enjoy a fight.  The majority of these fights, however, can be really boring to watch, with little effort from fighters to push the pace or make any progress.  I'm surprised the referees let them spend nearly 5 minutes just laying on the ground.

Vovchanchyn vs. Kerr was especially frustrating.  Igor tries to keep the fight upbeat and on the feet with striking, and Kerr gets a takedown and just lays there.  At one point he even gets perfect side control and does nothing but lay there, like he wants to go to sleep.  On top of that the judges can't decide a winner because there's so little going on for the 20 minutes, that they have to go to overtime.  Even then it goes to a decision but at least the fighters put some energy into the fight.

Herring vs Inoue and Almeida vs Shoji are enjoyable, Silva vs. Henderson is great, and Sakuraba vs. Gracie, while a disappointment because they could only keep it to a one round fight (Grace has a serious shoulder injury and PRIDE didn't feel comfortable letting him fight, but he's too stubborn to back down from Sakuraba) is an interesting fight while it lasts.  Fujita vs. Yvel is decent, featuing some good stand up and ground and pound but then a little too much lying around, with neither fighter accomplishing much.  I wouldn't recommend this unless you are going for an extensive PRIDE collection.",1249862400,,2097,4.522546419098143

Daijiro Matsui v. Quinton Jackson:

I was looking forward to a wild one between these two. Looking for Quinton to put on a slam display. Instead, you get the opening bell, two seconds of fight and a fight-ending kick to the groin.  This fight is a no contest. What a letdown.

Allen Goes v. Alex Steibling:

This is a ground fight in the first, with Goes on top and in control throughout the round. Steibling escapes some really good submission attempts. The second round is basically the opposite. The 3rd round is won by the fighter who is able to turn the grappling into a striking match on the ground. This is a technical battle that is fairly entertaining.

Murilo ""Ninja"" Rua v. Alex Andrade:

Andrade is a Lion's Den fighter. They call him ""El Toro"" in the den. He comes out strong in this fight, but is thoroughly controlled by Ninja, who is one of the most well-rounded fighters in Pride competition at only 21 years of age. This one goes to a decision.

Norihisha Yamamoto v. Jan ""The Giant"" Notrje:

Notrje is a pro boxer and he makes that apparent early on in this fight. Yamamoto finds a way to escape the striking of Notrje and gets the fight to the ground, where a boxer's skills are nullified. This one ends in the first round.

Igor Vovchanchyn v. Valentijn Overeem:

Igor is desperate for a strong win in this bout. He is coming off of a streak of tough losses and damaging fights. Igor lands a quick shot, Valentijn slams Igor and the fight is underway in a hurry. This one doesn't last all that long and has a surprising ending. Obe fighter steps out of the style to which he is most accustomed to win this fight.

Akira Shoji v. Jeremy Horn:

Jeremy Horn is so well known and so well respected in the MMA world. He makes his first appearance in Pride here at Pride 18. This fight goes to the ground quickly, which would favor Horn. Shoji gets a few takedowns and when the fight is standing, Horn seems to get the better of the lackluster exchanges. Horn does well with striking early in the 2nd round, but quickly and strangely pulls guard again and returns the fight to an unexciting state. This is a boring fight that goes to a decision.

Wanderlei Silva v. Alexander Otsuka:

Silva is expected to dominate this non-title fight... and he does. It is stopped in the 3rd round when Otsuka's nose is broken. No one seems to want to fight Silva at this point, as he is certainly the most dominant force in Pride Fighting at this point.

Semmy Schilt v. Yoshihiro Takatama:

Takayama comes out looking to touch gloves. Schilt ignores it and throws a front kick, which obviously angers Takayama. The fight turns into a quick slugfest that is ended promptly by a few crisp left jabs by Schilt.

This is a decent Pride event. It's not all that exciting, but it is worth seeing. We are robbed of a Quinton Jackson fight due to a groin shot, so hopefully we can see a rematch in Pride 19.",1151280000,3,2963,4.455555555555556
7959757,3,B000063UQH,"this pride was an impressive event on paper. consisting of fighters like kerr, igor, newton, henderson and sakuraba i thought how could this be anything but great? however once i actually began watching did i realize that good fighters doesn't necessarily mean good fights. most of the fights basically consisted of lay and pray tactics on the ground, however some of the fights worth mentioning are
1) dan hendrson vs. vanderlei silva - i have a mixed opinion of this fight. standing it was a war with both fighters looking as if they could knock the other out, but once it went to the ground it basically foreshadowed the fights to come.
2) carlos newton vs. johil de oliviera - at first glance a boring match, but on closer inspection a superb chess match display of skill and timing. oliviera defending his guard and newton constantly trying to pass. Very educational.
3) sak vs. gracie - where are the antics????? probably the worst sak vs. gracie encounter i ever seen! sure sakuraba gave Ryan a nice spanking at the end of the fight but more than 90% of it was booring.",1076284800,3,1076,4.638743455497382
7959758,4,B000063UQH,"Like every event I guess, there were some boring fights, but overall, this DVD had enough big names to keep it entertaining at least.  The Sakuraba fight was a little disappointing from the start, but some of the undercard fights made it worth the money - like watching Mezger, Vovchanchyn, Silva, Herring, Rodriguez, Newton, Henderson, and Yvel.",1063238400,,346,5.0701754385964914

7959760,2,B000063UQH,This dvd was full of lay and pray tactics.  Most of the matches consisted of one person laying in the guard and doing nothing.  They didn't even try submissons or the typical ground and pound.  Save your money.,1025049600,2,210,4.473684210526316
7959761,5,B000063UQH,"Pride 12 (a.k.a. Cold Fury) contains the the Sakuraba vs Ryan Gracie fight in which Sakuraba literally spanks him in the corner for laughs.  His fourth Gracie...Incredible!
It also has the amazing battle between Vanderlei Silva and Dan Henderson.
Those in themselves are fantastic but there are a bunch of other great matches on it as well.
Order it right now!!!",1015804800,3,362,4.934426229508197
