7884958,5,6305150877,"A great array of famous musicians playing with Bo Diddley, who still played both guitar and drums very well at his advanced age.
Bo demonstrated that he could also sing and move his feet very well in a kind of James Brown-ish way, which was fun to watch.
The sound and video is very clear and all who were there on stage were thoroughly having a great time.
So many musicians are listed on this, but some of them were either barely seen (John Lodge) or not even seen at all, like Mitch Mitchell.
It's both strange and surprising that this concert is only 50 minutes long. What you do see is quite joyous, though.
Does anyone know exactly when and where this took place? It doesn't state those details on the DVD that I bought (which was used and with no accompanying pages of information).",1447027200,,789,4.410958904109589
