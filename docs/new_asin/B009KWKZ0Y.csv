8542698,5,B009KWKZ0Y,"The sleeve of my copy quotes Screen Daily as saying this film is ""a joyous heartwarmer"". I don't agree. Nor do I think it was intended to be. To me this film is a gentle affirmation of the quality and beauty of brotherhood in the face of adversity.

Yes, these three youths do some stupid things, and you might find yourself wondering why they are doing these things, what they're rebelling against, but it becomes clear in good time.

Zak (Zachary Chasseriaud) and Seth (Martin Nissen) are brothers, aged thirteen and fifteen respectively. They've been left at their dead grandfather's house, under their own cognizance, for the summer, and as the boredom and ennui gets to them, they get into adventures and misadventures, joined by fifteen year old Dany (Paul Bartel), a friend they make on the way.

Martin Nissen is perfect as the hopelessly out of his depth elder brother, and Zachary Chasseriaud is natural as the try anything boundary pushing thirteen year old. Paul Bartel portrays very well the abused but resourceful teen. This film is the story of the three boys' journey through adolescence, and of the guiding lights and grotesques they meet along the way.

Zachary Chasseriaud is the image of Ricky Schroder at the same age, and just as talented. All three boys have a bright future if they stay in the business. I look forward to watching more of their films, and hope also to see more by the director, Bouli Lanners.",1361145600,4,1433,4.766129032258065
8542699,5,B009KWKZ0Y,"This tells the story of two brothers, Zak and Seth the eldest is fifteen and his brother just thirteen and three quarters, as he is keen to point out.  They are spending the summer in their deceased grandfather's house. Their mother has abandoned them for some selfish reason that we do not discover. What is clear is that they have very much been left to their own devices.

Whilst joy ridding (badly) in grand pops car they run into another young lad, this is Danny who comes from a dysfunctional family where his evil brother, paradoxically named `Angel' treats him like a punch bag. They smoke dope and steal food from their neighbours, but soon their money runs out and then they decided to make some money doing a ludicrous scheme. Everything inevitably back fires and they are left to their own devices which are limited to say the least. We follow them on their travels and it is a brilliant journey.

This is a very warm, often funny, sad and inspiring story. The boys are all just so believable in their acceptance of each blow as it falls and it just spills out of the screen in a way that has you engaged through out. It is also beautifully shot and framed, making the often wet Belgian countryside seem surreally breath taking. The music is great too. It was only at the end that I realised there were lots of things left unexplained, which is excellent and intelligent film making in my books.

The plot seems to unwind slowly, but not a frame is wasted, this is one of those films that we need more of and it put my faith back in kids again, not that it was really that shaken, but the trials of life can break the strongest of us and their camaraderie was a lovely thing to see. Writer and director Bouli Lanners has made an almost perfect film, he is also an actor who was in `Rust and Bone', he also made `El Dorado' in 2008 which was also called `near perfect'. In French with English sub titles and runs for 84 minutes, this is one for people who like original World cinema and it is a keeper  - very highly recommended.",1355443200,3,2040,4.386243386243386
