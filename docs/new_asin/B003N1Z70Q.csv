4156373,4,B003N1Z70Q,"Much like Tom & Jerry Tales, this new direct-to-video feature honors the duo's classic animation legacy while still feeling suitably ""modern"" for today's younger viewers.  A top-notch voice cast lends weight to the human characters of Holmes (Michael York), Watson (John Rhys-Davies) and Moriarty (Malcolm McDowell).  Thankfully, the cat-and-mouse team remains speechless (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tom-and-Jerry-The-Movie/dp/B00005UJ9X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tom and Jerry - The Movie</a>, if you dare, for evidence of why talking just doesn't suit the characters).

The plot is standard Baker Street stuff, involving stolen jewels and dastardly inventions (a few of which comes across a bit TOO advanced for the period setting).  Tex Avery's unforgettable Red and the Wolf figure into the plot as well, along with cameos from Spike, Droopy and a few other minor characters from the old days.

The animation is mostly very good, with precious little of the 3-D shading that only serves to remind long-time fans that they're NOT watching the characters with whom they grew up.  A final-act chase on a runaway carriage is particularly impressive, ending as it does atop the still under-construction London Bridge.

Aside from a couple of trailers, the only bonus feature is a brief art lesson, ""How to Draw Tom and Jerry.""  While the process is interesting to watch, it's unlikely that viewers will be ready to put any of Warner Bros' animators out of business anytime soon.

While the brief running time (50 min. for an ""all-new original movie"") might seem slight, it's about as long as it needs to be.  The film is perfectly safe for kids, if you don't mind exaggerated cartoon violence.  For adults who love Tom and Jerry, it's also a nice effort and probably won't tarnish your memories of the beloved cartoon stars.",1282780800,12,1876,5.4567474048442905

4156375,4,B003N1Z70Q,"I know Tom and Jerry are the stars, but I would've liked to have had a little more Holmes and Watson!  Michael York and John Rhys-Davies have such distinctive voices and it was great to hear them.  There were a number of references to Conan Doyle and actors who have portrayed Holmes and Watson through the years and that was fun.  I had to watch it a second time once I realized they were doing that throughout the video.  I collect Sherlock Holmes movies, etc., and this is a fun addition to my collection.",1439596800,,508,4.372340425531915
4156376,5,B003N1Z70Q,This is a great movie for young children.  There is almost no violence and the good guys prevail in the end.,1435968000,,108,4.142857142857143
4156377,4,B003N1Z70Q,"We start off with the a great aerial of London and some clever thievery by a trio of cats. The cats pull off a diamond heist using some nifty Steampunk gadgetry and are then chased by a bunch of constables on the roof tops. The cats do some great bits of parkour before they jump off a building and glide to a mystery man riding a horse where the drop the diamond to him.

The next morning we are introduced to Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson and Jerry who seems to be another of Holmes' assistants. Jerry lives with Sherlock and is a regular on his cases. As Jerry runs and errand for Holmes we are bump into Tom on his way to see Mr. Holmes with an urgent letter. Tom is minding his business when a series of unfortunate events, with Jerry leads him to Sherlock Holmes. This sets up the ""battles"" between Tom and Jerry as Tom was a bit indifferent with Jerry at the beginning and now there is a grudge.

Tom is the valet of Red Hot, an engaged high society type that is moonlighting as a lounge singer and is being blackmailed because of it. Holmes and crew arrive at the lounge where Red is singing, it's nice to the the City Wolf and the Country Wolf make a cameo. After the act we find that Red is being blackmailed in a similar fashion as one of Holmes' other cases, ""The Redheaded League"". We also find out that Red's home is next door to an embassy that is housing a rare diamond.

Spike and Tyke are guard dogs, go figure, that are supposed to guard the jewel, well you know how that goes, the cat burglars snag the jewel while Spike is teaching Tyke the ropes of being a guard dog. The cat burglars make a daring escape, much like in the beginning. Tom and Jerry and company head back to Red's house only to find that the diamond has been stolen from the embassy and that the police are on the way. Our crew splits up with Holmes and Watson searching for some leads in the clues that they have, leaving Tom and Jerry to help protect Red.

Cut over to Scotland yard where we meet up with, SURPRISE!, Droopy and Butch the Dog who are on the case of the missing diamond and the suspect Red...along with all of Scotland Yard. Our intrepid officers of the law give chase to Tom, Jerry, and Red. Our heros, duck into a church where we then meet up with Nibbles, an Irish Catholic priest and brother to Jerry. Nibbles hides Tom, Jerry and Red throughout the church while Droopy and Butch search. Eventually, our heroes slip from the Police and run through the streets of London. Meanwhile, Holmes and Watson are oblivious to the fact that they seem to be on wild goose chase in the countryside.

Back in London we go to Professor Moriarty's house, who sent Red to find Holmes, and is apparently an old family friend. It is then revealed the Moriarty is behind all diamond heists as he has created this heat ray in order to melt a hole in the Tower of London to steal the crown jewels. Tom, Jerry, and Nibbles rescue Red, but not before Moriarty steals the crown jewels. Meanwhile, Holmes and Watson finally realize they've been duped head back to London to go after Moriarty and gang. A fun chase through London ends with Holmes capturing Moriarty and returning the jewels.

Everyone is happy and Red marries her fiance, the City Wolf.

The Good:
I enjoyed this. This cartoon was really well paced, the animation was smooth and dynamic. There were a couple of running gags and slapstick action that got a good laugh out of me. The story was simple and safe and focused a lot on Tom and Jerry who didn't try to subvert each other but worked as a legitimate team, all be it begrudgingly. Tom and Jerry really seemed to have a lot of personality in this, at least more than the one-dimensional persona's of some other Tom and Jerry Direct to DVD. The other really nifty aspect about this Tom and Jerry is the bits of Steampunk technology that Professor Moriarty uses in his crimes.

The Bad:
Tom seems to be more clumsy as the movie goes, could be because he gets hit in the head...a lot. Tom is used as a punching bag a lot for some laughs and it gets old after a while. The other bad thing about this is that Sherlock Holmes and Watson really don't have much screen time and when they do the characters are kind of caricatures of themselves. It's hard to explain but they just fit the stereotype of who you think Sherlock Holmes and Watson to be. Now, that is kind of a nitpick point considering that I'm technically not the target demographic for these cartoons.

The Ugly:
Let's talk about Nibbles....why do the producers of these cartoons have to give this poor little mouse THE WORST accents?!?! I swear! Several of these direct to DVD movies have been very unkind to Nibbles in the most embarrassing way. Thankfully it's not as bad as ""Tom and Jerry: A Nutcracker Tale""; that accent on Nibbles was a crime. The other thing about these Direct to DVD is that all of the characters from the MGM cartoons have to have some sort of cameo and they usually are perfunctory. It's fun to see Spike, but I don't need to see him teaching Tyke in a rehash of ""That's my Pup"" in every single appearance in these movies. Droopy and Butch the Bulldog were part of the MGM cartoons but never part of Hanna-Barbera's run at MGM and it annoys me whenever they make an appearance. Red Hot and the Wolves were fun characters in this movie so they get a pass since their inclusion made sense to the story.

Overall
This is a fun romp at only an hour. The story was cute and had a great pace with some fun adventuring and mystery that the kids would enjoy.",1434067200,,5540,4.349129593810445

Shockingly my son who is 3 years old has never seen Tom and Jerry.

We both loved this. Theres nothing funnier for me than someone walking into a rake or having bricks fall on them...and Tom And Jerry are the masters of this.

Theres knowing nods to the Sherlocks and Watsons of old...as well as some Conan Doyle stories.

Theres even a cheeky nod to the end of the first Robert Downey Junior film...

4156406,5,B003N1Z70Q,"My natural instinct was to avoid this. But then my colleagues at goldenagecartoons.com recommended it to me. This is Tom and Jerry done right! The animation is dazzling, the story is well-written and intelligent, and the characters are true to their classic MGM roots. The film's writer, Earl Kress, passed away recently. He understood classic animated characters as well as their original creators did, and this movie is a testament to his brilliance. It makes me miss him all the more! You'd think sticking Tom, Jerry, Tuffy, Red Hot Riding Hood, Droopy and more into a Sherlock Holmes mystery couldn't possibly work. It does, quite well! It also LOOKS cool, with animation close to golden age quality, beautiful backgrounds and turn-of-the-century London settings, and clever steampunk gadgets peppered throughout.

4156412,5,B003N1Z70Q,"It doesn't star Robert Downey Jr., so it's not making big headlines, but Tom and Jerry Meet Sherlock Holmes deserves more attention, one reason being that it actually comes across much better than you might expect when you first hear the title.

First of all, the idea of the battling cat and mouse living in the home of a noted human harkens back to classic MGM theatrical cartoons, like ""Johann Mouse,"" in which Jerry danced to the music of Strauss. In this DVD feature, the duo are Baker Street co-residents and provide slapstick shtick in the course of a Victorian London mystery.

Say what you will about revivals of vintage cartoon characters, the issue is really whether the people behind the scenes care about the heritage and emotional value of the characters enough to make them appeal to young audiences but not forget the fans that made them beloved in the first place.

This film succeeds because the talent did indeed care. Veteran writer and acclaimed animation historian Earl Kress brought his expertise to the script, adding nods for fans and blending in Droopy and other great but not as well-known MGM characters such as Spike, Tuffy and Butch. The Tex Avery cartoon ""Red Hot Riding Hood"" is celebrated not only by including the libidinous Wolf but by making Red a major character in the story.

Sherlock Holmes enthusiasts will also get a chuckle out of the name of a character: ""Brett Jeremy,"" a reference to Jeremy Brett, who is one of the definitive actors to play Holmes along with Basil Rathbone. And speaking of actors, Michael York is superb as the animated Holmes, with Malcolm McDowell as Moriarity and John Rhys-Davies as Watson. Voice actors include Jess Harnell, Jeff Bergman, Grey Delisle and, doing a particularly accurate Tuffy voice, Kath Soucie.

And, as it should be, Tom and Jerry do not speak in the classic tradition of the original cartoons, all of which were directed by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera and won seven Oscars.",1283472000,7,1968,4.845238095238095
