8708962,4,B0000633EY,"The title of this video sounded intriguing, but I really didn't know what to expect.  It was only after I got the video that I discovered that you can check out video samples on-line at videoprogressions.com. Dewayne Pate is the instructor and is extremely talented, except when it comes to fashion.
  Tapping is a technique for bass that allows the player to add rich fill-in chops and chords while tapping on the bridge with both hands.  It is an exciting and fun technique to play. Exciting to watch as well. For those who like ""slapping"" it will add a whole new dimension.  This style is used alot by other bass virtuosos like Victor Wooten and Brian Bromberg.

  The instructor has some amazing techniques that put a whole new spin on what is possible on electric bass.  Everything is broken down methodically and put to use in lots of different musical styles (the blues stuff is especially cool). The video progresses with easy to learn tapping excercises and good camera views of the action. There is also a manual that comes with the video.
  Definitely a five-star tape for presentation and content, but I just had to take off a star for the instructor's fashion-sense (clown pants & muscle shirt)!  So if you want to take your bass playing to a whole new level of excitement, then this is definitely worth checking out.  The money is well spent when you consider the costs of taking lessons...",1034035200,2,1404,4.681632653061224
