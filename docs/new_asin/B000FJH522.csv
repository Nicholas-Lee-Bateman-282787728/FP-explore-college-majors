8123623,1,B000FJH522,This movie looks like it was shot by a 12 year old in the early 80's... Wasted my money on this...,1403049600,,98,3.7142857142857144
8123624,5,B000FJH522,"Finally, a film that deals with the sensitive subject of lesbian vampires and the drug dealers who love them.",1188518400,,109,4.7894736842105265
8123625,2,B000FJH522,"I honestly don't see how it's possible to make a film about a female vampire preying on other women and have it turn out this lame.  The plot was confusing enough, but that wouldn't have bothered my had the girl-girl scenes been hotter.  Instead we've got one goth girl kind of flirting with this other very attractive girl in a bar, and then there's another disjointed story involving a female vampire engaged in a really weak lesbian scene with another girl.  And, of course, they add some guys just to complete the lack of overall eroticism.  Clearly, here's an idea for a potentially really good lesbian vampire story that was watered down by a producer or director who didn't care for the whole lesbian-theme and so instead turned it into this unexciting piece of garbage.  Two stars for the attractive female casting and brief female nudity.",1171497600,13,847,4.773972602739726
