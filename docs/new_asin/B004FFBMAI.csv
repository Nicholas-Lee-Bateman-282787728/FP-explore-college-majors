8427794,4,B004FFBMAI,David Oistrakh is a tremendous violinist and so is his son Igor. The DVD was very good except for a major glitch in the recording on the Bach Concerto piece for two violins. The rest of the DVD was fine.,1432080000,,203,4.1
8427795,4,B004FFBMAI,"I bought it for the Bach, but all three performances were excellent.  The Bach was very moving, and the father son performance elevated the whole experience of the dialogue between the two principal instruments.  Davis was also very good with the ensemble.",1417305600,,256,5.071428571428571
8427796,4,B004FFBMAI,This DVD has what I feal is one of the greatest pieces of music written - Bach: Concerto for two violins and performed by two great violinests - Father and son Oistrakh. The second movement will make you melt. You can not only listen to the music but watch the historic performance. It is in black and white and has been well restored on this DVD. I gave one notch down; as I detected one small wow near the end of second movement. This could have been only on the copy I received. Over all a great DVD for clasical music lovers. I am very happy that I purchased this DVD.,1384473600,3,572,4.162162162162162
