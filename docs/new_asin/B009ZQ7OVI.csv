8545777,5,B009ZQ7OVI,"Great to see a story of this quality taken seriously and well acted by all. There is a strong central character: Sammy. The narrative revolves around him, and he is not dismissed by the other characters for being a child, as so often happened in other non-children's films of the era. This is important, because it shows the audience that Sammy is a real person, and it makes the audience more interested in what makes him tick. It also makes the other main characters more human. Thus the audience is drawn into, and involved in this tremendously strong small story. It appears however that some of the film was lost, as the film was apparently originally ten minutes longer. This is a shame because the audience becomes aware of the tiny leaps in the narrative flow. Still a great film though.",1403308800,,795,4.6453900709219855
