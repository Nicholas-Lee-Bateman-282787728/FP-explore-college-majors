8581028,5,B00CERJISC,"what is there to explain?  Most reviewers complain that they are not spoon fed the character's roles, the circumstances, etc.  Absolutely loved this movie!  Sensual, erotic, and painfully loving.  Yes, not exactly healthful, but enough love there to understand the circumstances ....and understanding the needs.  They couldn't live without each other - the passion was intense and they could portray it.  This film requires empathy and the ability to fill in some blanks (which requires one's own assessment of circumstances)....and I loved it!",1416960000,,544,5.493975903614458
8581029,1,B00CERJISC,"I was unable to view this film even after downloading software needed to watch this movie, I paid my money and was unable to contact Amazon, via on line to get a refund. I am not a happy Amazon customer right now.",1393372800,,213,4.095238095238095
8581030,2,B00CERJISC,"The two main actors do a really good job to tell a difficult story that is filmed to create an awkward and very tense atmosphere. This style probably fits the storyline well, however, it did not work for me. I think this story could have been told differently. If you like long silent periods and scenes that leave the viewer to guess most of the story told, you should enjoy this movie very much.",1388275200,,397,4.378378378378378
8581031,1,B00CERJISC,Very bad movie. I wish I hadn't bought it. Horrible script. Scenario made no sense. Very boring. Not even a few minutes of interest.,1382400000,,132,4.541666666666667
8581032,3,B00CERJISC,"I must admit that I got sucked into checking out this French film ""Tied"" based on the starring presence of the gorgeous Euro Model/Actress Laetitia Casta, and the premise/promise of some kinky sex play. This review is therefor skewed to reflect the Laetitia watching experience. As Laetitia-philes know... Ms. Casta made her initial North American splash, about a decade ago, as a model for the Victoria's Secret lingerie catalogs and has been generally touted as: 'one of the world's most beautiful women'. Thus it was with some enthusiasm that I anticipated viewing her in a filmic role as a dominatrix in, what sounded like, a potentially intriguing psychosexual-thriller.

The film delivered by director Hlne Fillires, however, somehow managed to suck most of the potential sexiness out of the proceedings and, instead, provided a relatively confusing story-line revolving around a trio of enigmatic and un-engaging characters.  Virtually no attempt is made to offer any involving back-story to the participants, and ambitious, but flawed, time shifting editing techniques only add to the quandary of the: 'who, what, where, and when' of transpiring events - and why should we care!?!  Laetitia spends much of the film just looking intensely perplexed about the whole situation (I could sorta relate!) and there's not much 'chemistry' between her and either of the 2 neurotic men that the screenplay asserts she is attracted to.

All of this vague-ness might have been forgiven if there was a little hot sex or a bit of skin to carry the show along, but even in that department ""Tied"" falls flat and contains neither.  You'd think that there would be an opportunity for the X-super model to don some fetish gear for a scene, but Laetitia spends much of the movie dressed in bland 'work-out' wear.  While this film does enjoy a slickly sophisticated production style and decent performances all around - the end result left me feeling flat.  Perhaps more of a 'renter' than 'a keeper'.  Worth a look for the lovely Laetitia, but it coulda' been so much more!  Technically speaking: a nice clean widescreen image - French language w/ English subs - no extras (other than some trailers).",1380240000,5,2188,5.055555555555555
8581033,4,B00CERJISC,"I saw it more as a morality play (or immorality play).  It examines the limits of humiliation in the setting of desired humiliation.  Artfully slow, if you aren't looking for escape and don't mind being tied down.  Not a sex movie, even though that may be the hook for some.  I thought the acting was good, intense.  Gave it extra points for the risque territory and deducted points for the Euro-fetish with the decadent rich and the easy ending, but I still liked it.  Classy look with some nice camera work.",1379030400,4,509,4.538461538461538
