1840439,4,B00008DZ8L,"The Butterbox Babies is a deep film.  The characters are clearly so well meaning as they start their home for unwed mothers, but slowly over the film they are corrupted by money and expedience.

You as the viewer, tend to stay sympathetic, until bit by bit you realise how corrupt they have become. You feel unclean for having sympathised with them so long.  It is a heartbreaker of a movie.

It shows that the choice is not between abortion and no abortion, but between abortion and illegal abortion.",1097539200,11,501,4.659090909090909

1840461,4,B00008DZ8L,"There is al lot more history to the Butterbox Babies that time and format could possible allow  in a film version.

The portrayal of greed and skirting the law was  present at the time.  Selling Canadian babies to ""rich Americans"" is something that that kind of got lost in the video.",1400112000,2,284,4.509803921568627

7982045,3,B00008DZ8L,"This video is actually disturbing.  That something like this actually was allowed to go on is terrible.  However, it did and this video accurately depicts it.  I would have liked to have seen more of what the girl's experience was.  It focused on just a few. I wondered it any of the girl's families sued or tried to get their babies back after it was revealed what was going on.",1505520000,,379,4.371428571428571

7982051,5,B00008DZ8L,"This was based on a true story about a maternity home in Canada that took in young unwed mothers, delivered their babies, and then sold some of the babies to wealthy families in the United States.  The couple in charge were not trained doctors and it was rumored that hundreds of babies died, either from poor hygiene practices or deliberate exposure to sick babies if the baby was born less than perfect.  The babies were buried in butter boxes, thus the name of the story.",1437523200,,474,4.564705882352941
