I was blown away by what I found. This movie struck a chord with me that few movies ever do. The rawness and intensity of the acting (Cillian Murphy and Elaine Cassidy) come together with rich imagery to truly make their world come to life. I can't say else that could make a person understand the enormity of the film without their first seeing it so I will end here.",1067644800,4,525,4.1568627450980395
1830833,4,B0000897BS,"Kontra is right,
This is a very interesting film. As an Irishman, I don't think its a foreign fim and the secret language is perfectly understandable.
Whatyou have here is an Irish, literary take on Romeo  and Juliet. The literary references are a nod at Dean Jonathan Swift's private language with Stella/Vanessa, a token hullo to finnegan wake and a final nod to Molly Bloom's soliloquy. So far so normal. Add in to this a clear grasp of the darker, violent side of the Irish soul and you have one of the most interesting and original and timeless things to come out of Ireland for ages. Yes, it was a play and that's obvious but there is modern French cinema in there too. Oh and Gavin Friday shows he can still do great stuff long after his Virgin Prunes days. (Still got that that  little blue number, Gavin).  This film is the business.

1830834,4,B0000897BS,"Immediately after watching Disco Pigs, I sat down at my computer and looked up the title...I noticed immediately that several of the reviews were very negative - one or two stars.  This puzzled me to no end, as I had just spent 90 minutes watching a thoroughly engrossing film.  And after reading the reviews, I'm still puzzled.  I could not find a single justification for any of the arguments put forth.
  The back cover makes a splendid correlation between the characters' world and Bjork lyrics.  We drift and float through their reality, but somehow come out of it feeling as though we have experienced something quite visceral.  Yes, the movie is far more abstract and poetic than your average Hollywood film.  But it's a far cry from avant garde.  There exists a defined (even tradtional) plot structure, and the audience never gets the feeling that anything about the movie is pretentious.
  The heavy accents make a few lines of dialogue hard to discern, especially since Pig and Runt (the two main characters) have reverted so far into their world as to have invented new words and phrases (a la Clockwork Orange).  Regardless of this fact, there was never a time when I was unsure what was going on - which says something about the directing in and of itself...Great foreign film, small time-commitment, and it's only a few dollars to rent.  Do yourself a favor and stop by the video store tonight...",1057190400,15,1411,4.7809917355371905

I waited months before watching mine and it was flawed (the film freezed at one spot and wouldn't play further). I had to chose a later chapter and back the film up to he flaw to see the end of it.

1830844,5,B0000897BS,"This is possibly my fave movie of the decade.  If you can make it through some of the thick Irish dialect (which took me at least 4 tries) it's a really great story.  Sort of.  Depends really on your outlook.  It's deeply beautiful story about one soul attaching itself entirely on another using it as a pillar of sorts. Darrin (Pig) can't see the world without Sinead and he can't share her either.  He realizes this hurts her, and makes the mother of all sacrifices for her happiness.  There is definitely a level of insanity to it which doesn't take away from the beauty but adds to the pureness of it.  A truly remarkable film.  I think the fact that Cillian Murphy portrayed Pig in the play helped with the mindset to make it such a brilliant performance.  I could literally feel his emotions through the screen-from just a look (the moment in the castle when she shows him her new skirt)!",1301184000,,894,4.469135802469136

this was a great movie.  my second movie to watch with cillian murphey, irish actor.

the movie was endorsed by the film board of ireland.

it was a really powerful movie with a lot of twists and turns.  i like the way this irish movie seems so uncensored.

i would recommend it as a wonderful watch for anyone.  after watching it i quickly loaned it to a friend to get her take on it.  she also enjoyed it very much.  it is about 86 minutes or so and is easy to watch in one setting.

i am so glad i read about it on the internet.

1830852,5,B0000897BS,"Pig (Cillian Murphy) loves Runt (Elaine Cassidy), and Runt loves Pig. They love each other to the exclusion of all the rest of creation. This seems idyllic, and it is, at least for a while. Pig and Runt are childlike teens approaching adulthood, at least physically. Mentally, they are both what they have always been, two children lost in each other. Then, one day Pig sees Runt in a new and different way. He sees her as a woman. Suddenly, she's not just the girl he's grown up with, but a beautiful, desirable woman. From here the relationship begins to change. Two types of love emerge. Pig is ill-equipped to deal w/ the emotions that overwhelm him. This is where the relationship leaves its crazy innocence behind, and becomes increasingly dangerous, even deadly. DISCO PIGS is a tragic love story in a similar vein to HEAVENLY CREATURES. Both films concern an all-consuming love that blots out all else. Both are among the few ""love stories"" I can stand to watch! Both are perfect...",1283558400,3,990,4.728323699421965

1830856,2,B0000897BS,"This coming-of-age story is set in Ireland and follows a girl, Shenaid, and a guy, Darren, who've been inseparable from early childhood.  Both are mischievous types, with Darren being the more violent of the two while Shenaid finds his antics all too adorable.  When Darren begins to express romantic feelings towards her, Shenaid doesn't know how to take it.  Her parents suddenly send her to a boarding school, and she and Darren are forced to spend (presumably) more time apart than they've ever done.  Darren realizes that he can't live without Shenaid just as Shenaid realizes that she can live without Darren.  Mayhem ensues.

What I couldn't come to terms with was the lack of police.  Any police.  Whatsoever.  Darren commits numerous abuses and crimes, even a murder, without so much as a siren going off.

The acting is amazing, and though the plot is a little slow at the beginning, I really got wrapped up in it after the first half hour. Watching the relationship between Pig and Runt evolve is like watching a train crash in slow motion: you know things will get bad, but you can't look away. The characters are so wonderfully acted, but even so, I don't think I'd see this movie again because it's so disquieting...a sign of a really good film that gets into your head!",1191628800,4,527,4.333333333333333
1830858,5,B0000897BS,"I saw Disco Pigs on the heels of watching Cillian Murphy in Red Eye.  What a triumph for director Sheridan. What stood out for me was the similarities between Pig's experience as an Irish youth and that of many young African-American males. Pig appeared to be reared in a single-parent environment where there was no father figure; his school social worker made reference to him as a ""lost cause"" and his identification with manhood was sought through having his first sexual experience with his girl, Runt.  Despite the dense dialogue, I was amazed to see that the two were actually robbing a liquor store at one point.  I could almost feel the downward spiral beginning as Pig slowly but surely lost his anchor with reality.  The sense of fear and doom I felt for these two teens mirrored the fear I felt for the teens in Boyz N' The Hood. The ending to Disco Pigs is an absolute shocker.  Few movies have moved me to that extent.  I was literally haunted for many months afterwards -- largely due to the outstanding performances by Murphy and Cassidy. Sheridan's expertise in directing successfully captures the innocence of youthful, unbridled puppy love, while simultaneously illustrating the affect of the erosion of confidence and dignity and the stark emasculation young males experience, often times at the hands of their own countrymen.",1175558400,5,1346,4.907488986784141
1830859,2,B0000897BS,"While I agree with the many positive reviews that this film is well-directed and shot, and engrossing in it's plot, it is also chock-full of weirdness. Cillian's bizarre hyper-exaggerated ""Cork"" accent made me want to reach into the screen and smack him at (many) points. This one aspect of the film alone ruins it for me. Perhaps the accent was chosen to make him seem more insane, but honestly, it made him seem more of a brutal dullard than anything else, which makes one wonder why Runt would have ever cared for his company in the first place.
All in all, an interesting, but aggravating film to watch.",1145923200,3,607,4.62962962962963
1830860,5,B0000897BS,"I highly recommend this film.  This movie is about obsessive love between 2 friends Pig and Runt. They share a world and a bond that seems to be unbreakable until their 17th birthday.  Cillian Murphy is incredible as Pig.  Even though his character is very violent, you can't dislike him. At times when Pig has went to far instead of getting upset with him, you want to embrace him.  He cuts at your heart deeply. You feel his pain and how much he loves Runt.  The ending made me cry harder than I've ever cried over a film in my life, even the titantic. When you view this movie you get lost in Pig and Runt's world. After viewing the film you can't stop thinking about the character's especially Pig.  The film seems to haunt you, but in a good way.  When viewing this film be prepared to become emotionally attached to the characters, do some serious crying and enter into a place you've never been. I promise you will enjoy the ride.

Not anymore, this is such a intensly close relationship, that I have never seen anything like it on screen ever before. There are 12 reviews of top critics giving it their heighest rating. If you ever had a strong ""puppy love"" you will recognize the strength of a bond here. But, that is not all. There is a story here; and, a character's personality not seen before, including showing the tendesest and also the most violent reactions of the male in his transition from teen to adult. Amazing. And actor, Cillian Murphy is flawless-even his singing (he really does) in karoke sceen. Here too is good example of scary obsessive relationship.",1130198400,5,737,4.811023622047244

He plays a desperately troubled teen (sometimes a pattern in his resume thus far) who grew up too close to his best friend.

How much he loved Runt and how Runt was coming out of her shell and seeing the world beyond Pig....wanting to break free from his grip. Pig loved her so much, he couldn't live without her, but couldn't live with her being so unhappy...

This movie has a different feel to it. Both characters present themselves, their feelings and emotions in a way that peole can relate to. The end scene was very sad but it was like a dark cloud was lifted off of Runt. I watched this movie months ago and its tune still lingers in my mind.",1098316800,4,604,4.392857142857143

1830867,4,B0000897BS,"""Disco Pigs"" is the story of two Irish teenagers, Pig (Cillian Murphy) and Runt (Elaine Cassidy), who have been inseparable since birth.  Born moments apart, they live next door to one another in Cork, speak their own language, live by their own rules, and generally do their best to ignore everyone else around them.  So far, they have managed to keep the outside world from creeping into their sur-reality, in which they imagine searching for a palace where they will be king and queen someday.
But the real world closes in and threatens this when Runt is sent away to a vocational school, and Pig realizes his world is nothing without her.  He tries to win Runt back and is lost when it seems Runt may not feel as strongly as he does.
Cillian Murphy is nothing short of extraordinary as Pig, teetering on the line between sanity and madness as he struggles to hold on to the world he and Runt have created, just as he tries to convince her to do the same.  Murphy clearly knows the character well, having originated the role in its successful theatrical run, and it shows.  The character practically jumps off the screen, he is so alive and present in each moment.
Elaine Cassidy seems less comfortable in the role of Runt.  She is a highly evocative actor, capable of registering a spectrum of emotions in a single glance, but her performance here is opaque and unfocused at times.  Murphy may get the fireworks as the volatile Pig, but Cassidy never registers Runt's emotional center.
This is director Kirsten Sheridan's first full-length film, and while it bodes well for her future, ""Disco Pigs"" is far from a perfect film, lagging at times and indulging itself in others.  It is a fascinating character study in which a world of contrasts is created.  The frenetic action of the Cork discos pitted against the calmness of the sea show how different Pig and Runt have become and how divergent their futures may be.  But Sheridan almost tries to put too much symbolism and too many allusions in the film and doesn't give herself enough time to flesh those out, making the film seem muddled and rushed in places.
All in all, though, ""Disco Pigs"" is an original, though-provoking film.",1082419200,24,2189,4.691906005221932
1830868,5,B0000897BS,"The tag line for this movie is ""90 minutes you'll never forget!"" and believe me, you won't.
Pig and Runt are best friends, twins from different mothers who have barely spent a minute apart. As a result, they have created their own private world, ignoring those around them. Though it sounds like a fairy tale scenario, it definitely isn't. They've lived in their own world so long, a world apart seems painful, even more so when Runt begins to search for something more.
The casual viewer may watch this movie thinking Pig is absolutely mad and a very unlikeable character. But I don't believe this is so. Pig has a very pure, very raw love for Runt. So pure and so overpowering that it overcomes any morality or sense of right and wrong that he might have. All that matters is that he and Runt stay together, no matter what. He is not an evil character. He is simply incapable of understanding the real world.
Runt, on the other hand, is a very strong, almost level-headed girl who knows that there is a world beyond Pig. A world with people in it, with more love. Love that won't smother her or cling to her. She loves Pig, but is unable to comprehend his level of commitment to her. As they both say, they are the other's world. But Runt is the only one who understands that these two worlds have the ability to merge.
This movie is one of the best I have ever seen. The actors understand their characters and live in their scenes. You don't see performances like the ones Cillian Murphy and Elaine Cassidy put forth very often. Pig and Runt are both extremely likeable characters and there were points where I rooted for both of them, despite their actions. The accents and secret language, to me, were easy to understand and gave it that ethereal, surreal feel. Innocence amid the madness. The tag line doesn't lie. These 90 minutes will stay with you for a very very long time.",1074902400,33,1883,4.49271137026239

You're pulled into a world made up of only the main characters.  Cillian Murphy blew my mind away with how versitile he can be.  You can tell this movie was a play before it was a film.

They both have low IQs but his is lower and he is considered a hopeless case.
