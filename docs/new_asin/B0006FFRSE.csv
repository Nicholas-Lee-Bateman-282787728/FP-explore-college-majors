2182459,5,B0006FFRSE,"If this is the same show I recently saw on NBC, ""The Best of Jimmy Fallon"" is definitely worth having.  I had no idea Fallon did so much great stuff.

I first saw him on ""Celebrity Jeopardy"" (without even knowing who he was at the time) and thought he did the most phenomenal Adam Sandler I'd ever seen.

He went on to do numerous impersonations flawlessly and, by the time the show as over, I was ready to run out and buy it on DVD.  Now I see I've got to wait until January.

The last couple of SNL Best Of volumes I've bought have been a little disappointing, but this one looks like a winner.",1099699200,7,596,4.103448275862069
2182460,5,B0006FFRSE,"WOW! This DVD is so great! Speaking as Jimmy Fallon's Biggest fan, this DVD is the perfect addition to anyone's Jimmy Fallon collection. If you love to laugh, then you'll love this dvd. The Best of Jimmy Fallon features all of his finest moments as well as what we've all been waiting for, the moment Jimmy got Lorne Micheals to laugh with his Sandler impression that landed him the job. Plus, we get audio commentary by the man himself!

And I said to myself, What a wonderful world! I am going to run my ass to the store and grab it the second the doors open!!

2182483,1,B0006FFRSE,"It is now official: Jimmy Fallon has dirt on some hollywood insider(s). That can be the only explanation for someone as unfunny as this guy working in show biz. I will give him this much: the ""beating a dead horse"" style of comedy used on SNL was right up his alley. He certainly fit right in on a cast that traditionally has 1 or 2 actually talented comedians on it and the rest of the cast members may as well be urinals.

Even Chris Kattan was able to hit a bonafide home run with his Roxbury performances.
Who can forget Joe Piscopo as Sinatra or in Johnny Dangerously?

Sad part is, Jimmy wasn't one of the talented ones. In fact, he's lucky he isn't digging ditches for a living. I'm curious to see how he'll be remembered in coming years since his attempts at humor ""brick"" despite getting plum jobs in the self-perpetuating industry.",1410912000,2,841,4.454545454545454

2182506,4,B0006FFRSE,"I have seen alot of Jimmy Fallon's episodes, I first started watching during his last season and while I like this movie and am a huge fan of Jimmy, This compilation unfortunately leaves some of his funnier and better bits.

Mick And Jimmy Backstage
- I have nothing against this sketch.

Jeopardy
- I'm not saying Jimmy is bad in this sketch, He just is part of a sketch and not the shining part of it.

Jarret's Room
- This one is the one with Sean William Scott. Pretty good, But I've seen other and better ones.

Barry Gibb Talk Show
- Perfect, Nothing else to say.

Impressions
- This collection has alot of his impressions, But I wish it was longer personally.

Z-105
- This one had Ben Affleck but I thought the Andy Roddick episode and Nick and Jessica one were better personally.

Update
- I love this compilation too but It's missing alot of his commentaries that he did the first season as Update host.

Sully And Denise
- The first one with Ben Affleck was pretty good but future ones with Gweneth Paltrow, Matt Damon, and Justin Timberlake were funnier.

Update:Flashback Songs
- Jimmy's claim to fame is singing parody songs. I wish they had more of his songs that he did. He did a U2 Parody, an Eminem parody and a Ricky Martin one that were sadly not included.

Cork Soakers
- From the Janet Jackson episode. Not bad, But he and Horatio did funnier sketches.

A Christmas Treat For All
- Jimmy, Tracy, Kattan, and Horatio singing ""I wish it was Christmas Today."" All those performances are pretty similar.

The Leatherman
- From the Britney Spears episode. Just kinda mediocre and not that special.

Van Morrison
- Jimmy does a Van Morrison impression while drinking Sam Adams. I'm not sure why this was on but it shows he can do a good Van Morrison.

Nick Burns Your Companies Computer Guy
- The first one with Jennifer Anniston.

Bloater Brothers
- The One with Jon Goodman where they get pulled over for drunk driving. I haven't seen other versions so I can't say if this one was the best.

Summer
- Jimmy's last sketch as a tribute to Grease. Amy Poehler wrote this sketch and a touching farewell to Jimmy.

Abducted By Aliens
- A sketch that was cut from dress. Again, I can't say anything about it.

Here are a Few sketches they sadly missed that I wish were included:
- A Glimpse of our possible future with Ralph Nader
- Equal Time TV with Jeff Zucher
- Jeffrey's With Sean Hayes
- Mindy & Sky with Gweneth Paltrow
- Last Call With Carson Daly

He has also made numerous cameos and hosted one of the best Christmas shows in recent memory. Hopefully NBC and SNL will release a 2nd best of.",1358726400,,2612,4.426778242677824
2182507,5,B0006FFRSE,"I love Jimmy Fallon a lot, so I was really excited for this DVD. It was definitely worth the money. Some of the skits I didn't really understand (like the Barry Gibbs Talk Show) because of my age, I guess, but those skits are still funny just because of the people in them.",1356393600,,273,4.169811320754717

I hope they also do another one soon with all his new impressions, Jim Morrison of the Doors, Neil Young, Bruce Springsteen, David Bowie/Tebowie, ha ha! and so much more.

2182517,5,B0006FFRSE,"Jimmy Fallon is one of those guys you can't help but like. He has one of the best shows airing now, Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. But as far as SNL work goes, he was known for cracking up during bits. For some that was annoying, for most it's hilarious. I for one love when the actors break character. It makes the sketch that much more laugh out loud funny. For anyone wanting to see more of Jimmy, I would recommend looking up his comedian impression acts. He is HILARIOUS and dead on. He does a great Adam Sandler but can also do countless other. And his impressions aren't limited to comedians. He can do anyone. There was actually a clip of him playing a game where he did impressions of random celebrities and yes, it was extremely funny.

For the poster who thinks anyone who likes Fallon has a retarded sense of humor, someone needs to make you aware that your opinion on what is funny is NOT actually truth. It's an opinion. And a wrong one at that.

For anyone looking for comedy, don't stop at this. Check out Late Night with Jimmy Fallon and see why more and more people are watching tv at night. He WILL make you laugh.",1285632000,,1132,4.309859154929577
2182518,4,B0006FFRSE,"But the majority of the time he only made the audience laugh because he himself couldn't keep a straight face.

2182519,4,B0006FFRSE,"Jimmy Fallon is probably my second favorite person on SNL, just behind Will Ferrell. I watched this DVD a couple of years ago and finally decided I wanted to add it into my permanent DVD collection, it is a great addition in my opinion.",1186617600,,236,4.386363636363637
2182520,4,B0006FFRSE,"Jimmy Fallon is one heck of a great impersonator!  My favorite sketches on this DVD are:

The one where he mimics Mick Jagger in the mirror;

The computer guy - so funny;

The Beegees parody with Justin Timberlake;

and finally the Weekend updates.  Especially the one that Tina Fey has made a video of Fallon's musical tributes to holidays, and it goes back to Buddy Holly!

I love this DVD, and put it near my favorite Best of SNL's, like

Will Ferrell, Adam Sandler and Chris Kattan!",1171843200,7,486,4.505747126436781
2182521,3,B0006FFRSE,"Jimmy Fallon is funny but not as funny as many would think. He does get his laughs from messing up sketches which I dislike. Sometimes I get upset when he keeps ruining sketches. But overall as an Weekend Update reporter I really did like his jokes and interviews. I kindof wish that there was a dvd for all the Weekend Update for both Jimmy and Tina together. I would totally buy that. I did like the sketch where Jimmy returned at the end of season and I think he was imitating ""Fonzie""? He does make a good parodies for music. I find it funny but sometimes I think he takes away too much camera time. Plus he looks at the camera too much!! Either he forgot his lines or he's looking for laughs....which seriously isn't funny.

I wouldnt say Jimmy is a huge star yet. His 2 movies : Fever Pitch and Taxi wasn't a good start. I would like to see what he will do in the near future.

I am upset that some of the classic SNL memebers were never given the Best of and Jimmy got his so fast. It boogles my mind and I kind of hate Lorne Michaels for doing that. I really wanted to see the Best of Colin Quinn.",1166140800,2,1105,4.111111111111111
2182522,1,B0006FFRSE,"I think it's beyond question if you're a SNL fan - Jimmy Fallon sucks.  I really believe Lorne Michaels thought he was funny for some reason and really let him get away with being terrible.  I blame Lorne Michaels and the live studio audience for continuing to ""reward"" Fallon by clapping and going crazy every time he broke character.  I never understood why the audience thought it was so great, it was funny when SNL members did it in the past because they did it only rarely; maybe once a season.  Fallon cracks himself up every skit and the audience laughs and claps, so in Fallon's head he learns that when he breaks character he will get laughs, and so he did it over and over and over again.  Terrible.  If you bought this DVD you're sad.",1159142400,20,746,4.408759124087592
2182523,5,B0006FFRSE,"I was reading some of the other reviews and here is the bottom line. You can't please everyone all of the time. Humour is individual. You either love the BBC's ""The Office"" or you totally do not get it. I Love THe Office-BBC version- and I loved Jimmy Fallon's DVD.

  People criticize him for laughing during the skits, but to be honest, to some of us, it makes us laugh even harder.

Life without laughter is pointless.

So let Jimmy give you a chance to laugh today.

I know I did.

2182524,5,B0006FFRSE,"First let me address those people who are bashing jimmy fallon for 'not being funny' it's a simple case of people who are too dumb to understand his jokes. people get over yourselves, jimmy's gone on to become a huge star, he hosts the mtv vmas, the mtv movies awards and is the only successful member of the snl cast to do [...] since he left the show(too early it must be said) where the hell is chris kattan? corky romano says hi! tracy moragan...haha cancelled from NBC! jimmy's movies might not all be your cup of tea, SO DONT WATCH EM!

Now to the dvd. this is jimmy doing his thang, i do agree nick burns sketches should be included, but there's still enough of his brilliance here on this dvd. peoplewho say jimmy is never serious and that he breaks character all the time don't mention that when he does he practically MAKES THE SCENE HILARIOUS! for example his laughing in the cowbell sketch framed the whole brilliance of that scene. jimmy is a real comedic talent, and despite those neysayers, he's still got mad talent.

2182526,5,B0006FFRSE,"This is one of the best SNL DVDs yet. All the sketches are hilariously funny. None of them near dissapointing. The DVD starts off w/ the sketch,Mick & Jimmy Backstage. The one w/ Jimmy being Mick Jagger's mirror reflection. It has Jeopardy w/ Jimmy @ Adam Sandler. The next sketch is Jarret's room then it's Barry Gibb Talkshow w/ an appearance by Justin Timberlake. That is only the first four & there's 13 more to go. More guests appearances inlude Ben Afflek,Jennifer Aniston,Robert De Niro,Britney Spears,Paris Hilton & Janet Jackson. And of course,appearanes by SNL regulars. Not to mention extra features like commentary,audition,and more. This DVD is worth every cent you spend.

2182527,1,B0006FFRSE,"Please, I want to see just how tarnished the image of SNL can get. Not that I won't place this gem next to Fever Pitch in my collection, even though I keep em in alphabetical order and I don't own Fever Pitch, or Taxi (The movie), because I don't like Jimmy Hit-and-Miss Fallon. Marvel as he stumbles over lines and laughs out loud inappropriately. It's part of his charm some say. Well if Eddie Murphy had flubbed like that, he would have been out the door, and the back door too, cause Lorne Michaels hates black people.
Well, people of all colours UNITE in your hatred of the white-bread Fallon and his modern slaveowner Michaels as they plunge NBC's late-night status down the tubes so people can watch Comedy Central or that Cartoon Network with the newfangled Adult Swim doohickie!

2182529,5,B0006FFRSE,"Out of all the Best of SNL DVDs that I own (about 9 or 10) I would have to say that this one is my favorite. I'm a fan of Jimmy's to start out with..but also this DVD was put together a lot better than the rest. The audio commentary is an added plus, and also the music video for Jimmy's 2002 song ""Idiot Boyfriend"" (one of the funniest things on the DVD) is on the extras as well. There is also a dress sketch of Jimmy singing Drinkin' In the Woods for Thanksgiving. This is a great supplement to his CD. The feature itself has some pretty funny sketches..I love the Update bit. I do somehow believe they could have put a few more better sketches on here (Where was Jeffrey's?) and maybe feature a gag reel of some of his bloopers..but I still love this.",1143158400,4,755,4.142857142857143
2182530,1,B0006FFRSE,"Jimmy Fallon is about as funny as a dead person. Dead people aren't funny.

His ironic-hipster-slacker-cokehead routine (and yes, he does coke in real life at Manhattan clubs and gets in rowdy fights all the time) is totally obnoxious. He makes Adam Sandler look like a comedic genius.

And talk about an attention-craving whore. He ruins every single SNL gag he's ever been on with his outbursts of laughter at his own joke.

The whole ""shy embarrassed but lovable goof who laughs at his own jokes as part of his lovable shtick"" thing isn't lovable. In fact it's despisable.

The fact that he got a Best-Of and other classic SNL comedians have not is a sad fact.",1139875200,12,663,4.641025641025641
2182531,2,B0006FFRSE,"i have to be honest, also. i mean jimmy fallon is just not funny. maybe he can play a villian in Sin City 3 though :):):)'

2 stars since it is SNL :):):)",1138579200,6,154,3.6666666666666665
2182532,5,B0006FFRSE,"I am a HUGE SNL fan and have most of the Best of DVD's. (working on getting them all) Jimmy's is, as expected, absolutely excellent. I don't think people realize how talented he really is. This DVD will definately help with that. Since Jimmy left the show, I hate to say it, but it's not as good. I know there are a lot of people who would agree. Of course, I would never stop watching, ever! It's my all time favorite show, and I was eight when it premiered, so I've been watching it almost from the start. And what I didn't see originally, I've seen since. Love SNL, love Jimmy, and I sincerely think you will, too! GREAT BUY!",1135555200,5,628,4.241666666666666
2182533,1,B0006FFRSE,"First of all, let's be honest. Jimmy Fallon is not funny! Have you seen Taxi? Have you seen Fever Pitch? How he got so much notoriety on SNL is beyond my comprehension. He is basically an Adam Sandler wannabe who tries really hard to say something witty and fails every time. He's like a promising young rookie who never really lives up to the hype. Sure, he has enthusiasm but let's not mistake that for comedic talent. It boggles my mind that stellar SNL cast members such as Billy Crystal and Martin Short don't have a BEST OF collection but they made one for this moron. Bypass this one and pick up BEST OF CHRIS KATTAN or TRACY MORGAN if you are looking for some of the newer cast members.",1133308800,10,694,4.346153846153846
2182534,4,B0006FFRSE,"It's not Jimmy's fault that they picked not so good sketches for this DVD. I love Jimmy and the fact that he would crack up in the middle of the sketches made the sketches all the more hilarious and made him even more charming. I think that's why people love him. He was the BEST thing to ever happened to SNL.

As for this DVD, the Weekend Updates are priceless and I love the ""Drinkin in the Woods"" segment. They could have picked better sketches though. The audio commentary from Jimmy and the writers are hilarious in itself. And I almost forgot about that his SNL audition is on there too. You can tell he's kinda nervous or he seems nervous to me cause he's soft spoken, but his performance in that audition doesn't show it at all.

I put 4 stars cause it's not that great, but it's not that bad. All in all, if you're a Jimmy fan, it's a great addition to your DVD collection.",1130544000,2,883,4.25

2182536,5,B0006FFRSE,"You know, by himself, Jimmy Fallon isn't that funny. He can't keep a straight face to save his life and his improv is horrible. BUT, I was very surprised with his ""Best of..."" special. Some of the skits they chose for this one were just hilarious (Barry Gibb, Weekend Update Holiday Songs). The montage they had with the many impression he did on the show was great. This is definitely one of the better ""Best Of..."" discs in the series.",1123200000,3,437,4.475
2182537,4,B0006FFRSE,"I started watching SNL about 6 or 7 years ago (about the time that Jimmy started) and I have always been a big fan of him.  I watched the show just to see him and his weekend updates.

This DVD is pack with Jimmy Fallon's best moments from his 6 years on the show.

Here's what this DVD includes and what I thought of each on a scale from 1 to 5:

1. Mick & Jimmy Backstage - 4

2. Jeopardy (the one where he immitates Adam Sandler) - 4... I didn't feel that this was his best one.

3. Jarret's Room - 4... I didn't think this was one of his best of the ""Jarret's Room""s he had.

4. The Barry Gibbs Show - 3... I wasn't that all impressed. I didn't feel this was one of his best either and I think the only reason they put this one on the DVD is because Justin Timberlake is in this with him.

5. Impresssions - 5 - they really should've had more of these, because I feel that this was his best and they should've had the full skits of these on the DVD instead of the little segments of each complied together like they have on here.

6. Z-105 - 3 - this one was just, ehh... all it is is Ben Affleck (his old on-air buddy) mocking him while on the air and he gets frustrated with him.  Again, I think the only reason they put it on is because a celebrity (Affleck) is in it with him.

7. Update - 5+++ - these are his absolute best.  Him and Tina Fey, in my personal opinion, were the best reporters for the Weekend Update.  This includes his finest moments.

8. Sully and Denise - 3... agan, Ben Affleck was in it, and that's the only reason it's on here.

9. Flashback Songs - 5... these are good and they are NOT like Adam Sandlers.  Adam's was 100% original, while Jimmy took popular songs and changed the words into something funny to go with the holiday he was singing about.

10. Cork Soakers - 5 - this one is actually really good AND it has a celebrity (Janet Jackson) in it.

11. A Christmas Treat - 4

12. The Leatherman - 5 - like Cork Soakers, it has a celebrity (Britney Spears) and it's good.

13. Van Morrison - 3... it isn't much but him singing and drinking beer then getting drunk and eventually ends up wearing all of it.

14. Nick Burns - 5 - this one's good and it has Jennifer Aniston in it.

15. Bloater Brothers - 4

16. Summer - 4... it's alright and I understand why they put it on there.

17. Abducted by Aliens - 3... it's nothing much, but yet again, I see why they put it on here.

Overall, I just felt that there were some things on here that there should've been more of (like the impressions) and get rid of the ones that I rated lower.

Jimmy has his own unique talent, and if you enjoy it, it's worth it.

And as for those of you who say, ""He sucks because he laughs after all of his jokes."" Okay, yes he does, but he doesn't break character while doing it.  Hey, it's just something that the character's role that he's playing may just happen to do.  That's the personality of the character that he is portraying.  It's not like it's a bad thing by making the skit any less funny.

AND so he sings songs... there have been others on SNL that have, so what?  And his are different from Sandler's anyway.

In conclusion, it's worth the buy, but it ain't perfect.",1121040000,9,3198,4.073717948717949
2182538,5,B0006FFRSE,This is a pretty good video to watch when you need a laugh. There were some of his funny moments that I would have liked to have seen on the dvd that weren't there. The video for idiot boyfriend makes it worth the purchase though.,1120780800,2,230,4.133333333333334
2182539,5,B0006FFRSE,"I have been a life long SNL fan and I have had the pleasure of seeing some great moments on SNL and seeing people go from nothing to really famous because of this show. Lorne Micheals is a hell of a star maker, and you can't deny it. He saw something in Fallon and its obvious. Adam Sandler is one of my favorite people but other than doing a movie with Drew Barrymore and playing the guitar he really doesn't have much in common with Jimmy Fallon. When Adam played guitar it wasn't for jingles, like Jimmy, Adam never did impressions on a regular basis. Also Sandler wasn't an anchor on Update. Jimmy and Adam have different material and differnt senses of humor.

Jimmy and Tina Fey brought Weekend Update back from the dead, this DVD shows a collection of Fallons better Update bits and gives you another look at the great chemestry he had with Tina.

Jimmy's impressions are phenomenal, they are accurate and funny. Sure he may laugh or break up on camera but to be honest any real SNL fan would realize he is far from the first person to do this. I've seen Sandler do it, hell I've seen Bill Murray and Gilda Radner break up, so don't just get pissed at Jimmy for laughing. Its live TV, sometimes mistakes happen.

This DVD has some great stuff on it. It includes some things you didn't see on SNL, including a dress rehersal performance of ""Drinking in the Woods"" This also has audio commentary and its fun to listen to two writers and Jimmy go on about a sketch and get off topic, its as though you're watching it with them.

If you don't like Jimmy don't buy this, but anyone who claims he has no talent has obviously not watched the shows Jimmy was on very closely.",1120348800,9,1674,4.372990353697749
2182540,5,B0006FFRSE,"With fantastic impressions and a modern, hip humor, the best of jimmy fallon is hilarious. Alot of people want to just say hes ripping off sandler. Most of these people are looking for something to use against Fallon, because they don't like him. Dont let these people miss-lead you. Sandler didn't do impressions. Sandler wasn't an anchor on weekend update, and to be honest most of fallons stuff is better then sandlers! Now granted, he will sometimes look at the camera or laugh in a sketch. He does struggle with that. But never the less, hes hilarious. GET THIS DVD!",1119052800,6,571,4.72
2182541,4,B0006FFRSE,"I honestly think that they should do a better job screening some of the reviews that are posted on this website. Those who give this DVD one or two stars are being way too unrealistic. I must admit, when Jimmy Fallon became a regular on the show, I didn't think him to be too funny, but over the years I've grown to find him very funny. He has his own brand of comedy, And he didn't borrow it from Adam Sandler! Some of you ""critics"" need to step back and analyze things with less of your black & white opinions and more rational, educated critique. If you like Jimmy Fallon you'll like the DVD, if you don't you probrably won't. All in all, it's well done. Props to Fallon.",1118448000,11,674,4.232558139534884

Proceed to let Jimmy Fallon crack up incessantly during the filming despite the dress rehearsals filmed hours prior to the show. By this time, the audience has fallen for Fallon's trick: he laughs while filming an SNL skit so it must be funny so now the audience laughs. Jimmy Fallon has subliminally implanted the idea that he is funny into your minds by laughing at his own lame skits! OILA! THE BEST OF JIMMY FALLON!

2182546,5,B0006FFRSE,"Being a big fan of ""Saturday Night Live"", I at first never really enjoyed Jimmy Fallon's work that much. I thought he was talented, but not very funny. But then I decided to get his best - off, mostly because I'm an ""SNL"" completist who makes it a task to get every dvd related to the show on the market (so far I have everything but ""The Best Of Will Ferrell, Volume 1"" and ""Christmas""). So I went home to watch it, not expecting to be blown away. However, I wound up laughing pretty much the whole way through.

This dvd focuses on most of Jimmy's principle characters. Among the best are a hilarious edition of ""Jarret's Room"", radio shock jock Joey Mack from Z - 105, Boston Teen Pat Sullivan and Nick Burns, computer guy. The two best sketches are a montage of his many impressions and a hysterical ""Celebrity Jeopardy"" with Jimmy doing a phenomenal Adam Sandler impersonation.

Overall, this may be the best ""best - of"" yet. The only sketches I wish were here are ""Wake Up Wakefield"" and ""Top O' The Morning"". Other than that, this is an excellent representation of Jimmy Fallon's work on ""Saturday Night Live"".",1109980800,29,1117,4.524752475247524

I personally sigh and turn off the TV as soon as I see him enter the sketch because I know he'll just ruin it.  If you want a really good SNL best of DVD, Dana Carvey, Christopher Walken, and the Chris Farley tribute are three of the best.  I have always been a huge SNL fan, but I hate Jimmy Fallon and he's solely responsible for the recent decline of the show.",1108166400,12,507,4.04
