4229348,3,B003YIISIG,"This movie very simply depicts the life of a oy, the way he sees life through his eyes, the simple pleasures of life. It moves at the pace of life, slowly binds you into it.

I like it. It doesnt try anything fancy. its slow, but nice.",1387929600,,235,4.0

4229351,5,B003YIISIG,"Heartwarming slice of life, sensitively done. The description is a little off, as you wait for the life-changing event a bit too long. Excellent acting.",1420848000,,152,5.12
4229352,5,B003YIISIG,"This film is very subdued, but is very impressive.  The plot is very touching with themes of family, sibling love and rivalry, domestic violence, extreme poverty and the pain caused by it.  The actors are very expressive.  I felt sad after watching the film, but for those who would like to know what is like to be very young and very poor, it is a good film to watch.",1417392000,,368,4.304347826086956
4229353,5,B003YIISIG,"The movie requires audience participation in that it has very little ""action"" - long, almost still pictures that beg for you to fill them with something - thoughts. If you don't, and you're able to shut your mind and simply go with it, then the movie is almost like a meditation: it calms you down and it makes you accept life as it is, just like the little boy and the mother and the entire family accepted theirs. A beautiful moment for me was when Thiago was playing with dirt (there were several moments like this) - a little boy and the earth, no distractions, nothing else. It almost forced me into the screen and into that bare scenery.",1413158400,,643,4.411764705882353
4229354,5,B003YIISIG,"A heartwarming story of a child who is too young and somewhat sensitive to the world around him. Living on a poor and desolate Brazilian farm, Mutum is faced with many unexplained situations--his dog taken away; his brother and best friend Felipe dies; his abusive father forcing him to work in the fields. Then as the movie nears its end we see his mother giving him away, leaving us with an ending filled with doubt and anticipation, leaving it up to us, I guess, to decide on the outcome of his future. Seeing the love and respect the mother had for him, however, I would like to think her decision may be somewhat wise; that maybe she was able to see in him the potential of a great future much better than if he had stayed on the farm. An outstanding film!",1398470400,5,761,4.366197183098592
4229355,4,B003YIISIG,"In the slower side, but not too slow for my taste. The story of a boy and his family in a really poor farm.",1396137600,,107,3.5
4229356,3,B003YIISIG,"If you enjoy movies that provide a glimpse of a little exposed or talked about place in the world, this is an interesting  look at an impoverished family living in a remote village in Brazil.",1395273600,2,191,4.457142857142857

4229358,4,B003YIISIG,I liked that this is an international movie. The children in it are adorable and great at acting. The only problem is that the story plot is kind of slow and there isn't much too it.,1388102400,2,182,4.083333333333333

8409338,5,B003YIISIG,"Our family lived among the poor in the mountains of the Philippines. Very authentic presentation.  This movie truly depicted the cruelness of poverty and yet the love that is expressed in ways that are hard for the affluent of this world to fully grasp.  You felt like you were there.  I would recommend this movie to anyone that loves the poor, there is so much to learn.  Great photography!  ""Blessed is he that considereth the poor!""  God said that.",1505952000,,452,4.658227848101266

8409340,4,B003YIISIG,Was a good movie. The actors were really good. Especially The main little character. The movie was slow moving but that allowed the viewer to truly feel the emotions and the atmosphere. It was heart wrenching but a reality for some.,1496275200,,232,4.682926829268292

8409342,5,B003YIISIG,"This is a complicated movie with many things going on.. The events play out in a family structure that is strained and isolated. The slower pace to the movie really helps the viewer to understand and appreciate what is going on. Were it to be faster paced the contrasting qualities would easily be overlooked and the whole movie would lose the essence of it's portrayal of grief, despair, loss and brokenness. The main actor Thiago seems to go through a prolonged period or disenfranchised grief, brought on mostly by the distancing of his father and the effects of it. However, there are other factors that play into this as well. Overall, the movie flowed well for its purpose.",1468886400,,679,4.762711864406779
