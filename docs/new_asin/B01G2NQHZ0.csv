8762177,4,B01G2NQHZ0,"I'm reviewing both versions available on Amazon as of November 2016, one by PMP Entertainment and one by Poh Kim Singapore.

The drama itself deserves 5 stars. It draws you in from the start, the leads are fabulous, and all the supporting actors/storylines all hit their mark. It's made it onto my list of all-time favorite K-dramas.

However, the DVD product isn't exactly what I'd hoped. Probably due to copyright reasons, they've removed all the scenes where the restaurant staff sing ""Congratulations"" by Cliff Richard to one another, and changed the riff that Jo Jung-suk plays before he starts to sing ""Give Me Your Chocolate."" (In the original version, he plays a short riff of ""Dust in the Wind."") BOTH DVD sets do this.

Otherwise, for this PMP Entertainment set, the video quality is good, and so are both the English and Chinese subs. The packaging for this set leaves something to be desired, though. You get a fairly official-looking hard plastic cover/box, but the discs aren't nicely placed inside; they're just in flimsy, cheap sleeves, without any accompanying artwork.

The Poh Kim set looks MUCH better aesthetically; the box looks/feels a lot more official, the discs have artwork with the various actors featured on the discs, and each disc has its place in the hard disc slots melded to the cover. The cover itself features the main characters, with bios for each character and full-color photos. However, the Poh Kim translations don't seem to be quite as good as PMP (at least for English).

I just wish the show was released exactly as I saw it on DramaFever. :( If you don't care about the small bits they've cut, you'll probably be totally happy with this product.",1478131200,7,1691,4.857638888888889
