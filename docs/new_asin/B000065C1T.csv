7960963,1,B000065C1T,"Well, IF I could watch it, Im certain I would give it 5 stars. HOWEVER, since I live in the U.S. and this particular dvd set travels from the UK and not some seller in the U.S., it is region coded for some blasted reason. The possibility of this dvd set being region coded slipped my mind. I can only hope my, as yet untested, individual seasons of A Bit of Fry and Laurie are not similarly bound.",1431648000,,397,4.102564102564102

Subtitles are a necessity for the hearing-impaired, I cannot follow the dialogue on these dvds at all, so I can't give any opinion on the content. What a disappointment, this is a great bunch of British funny people.",1376870400,2,317,4.482758620689655

It is a group effort.  This is not for everyone, some people don't like anything, but I love this.",1351209600,,274,4.0
7960967,4,B000065C1T,"Pride Video takes pride in offering films that this firm considers to be non-pornographic, however explicitly sexual, many of them (like this one) featuring the famously beautiful and ""well-endowed"" male models/actors of Bel Ami Studios, in filmed collaborations that are priced much more modestly than Bel Ami Studios' product on its own Bel Ami and Ayor labels.  That is so in the sense that these films, although quite explicitly erotic, avoid such things as vulgarity or demeaning exploitation of the sex acts filmed; gratefully, they are free, too, of gratuitous violence and aggression. The company's videos, for all of that, are quite explicit and sweetly, enjoyably, and affectionately erotic, sex for its tenderness and beauty, a sense of fun (however sometimes fleeting), for self-expression, and for attempted self-realisation through mutual sexual fulfilment.

""Alfresco"" (Pride Video WOL-3758-D as numbered on the container; VFC-01658/PRI-71014 on the DVD disc itself) is a fine example of what Pride Video purveys, consisting of mostly unrelated segments, about gay encounters, entitled: ""Barnyard Frolics""; ""Come out to Play?""; ""It's Warm Inside""; ""Back to the Farm""; and ""Voyeurism"" continuing as ""3's not a Crowd"". There is no recorded dialogue in any of the segments, the sound track consisting of some nondescript electronic musical background. There is only the most minimal attempt at plot.

In ""Barnyard Frolics"", Johan Paulik, the gay superstar of that famously boy next-door look, when he has his clothes on (and here Paulik is nude from beginning to end), is a smoldering foundry of eroticism when thus buck-naked.  His segment, with the casual sex partner depicted, is the first episode on this non-dialogued set of gay encounters. Paulik's seething sensuality is hard to resist (and who tries, anyway?).

However, surpassing even what Paulik achieves is the segment that takes place mostly in an abandoned warehouse or derelect former factory, in the episode titled ""Come out to Play?"", wherein two sweetly handsome boys go to have sex.  And what love-making they have!  The last embrace, of one of them posed leaning backwards, buck-naked, against his equally bare mate, who holds him in his arms, the frontmost lad's chest raised up, his sleekly muscled torso forward and his tumescent (but, by this point, not quite still fully erect) penis lolling from side to side, is simply one of the most breath-taking camera shots, whether still or moving image, of two naked gay young men together that these eyes ever have beheld, a sensuous pose worthy of Caravaggio's artistic attentions!

The remainder of the video's segments is of somewhat lesser level of inspiration, but the sneaker-peeper in ""Voyeurism"" (leading to ""3's not a Crowd"", without break, when the two lads fornicating in the barnyard discover him at the gate as he has been watching them and pleasuring himself), is quite handsome, more so than the two farmboys who had been exploring various sexual positions as he was espying them.  The segment ends as the two farmlads turn their sexual attentions now upon their very happy and soon fully satisfied erstwhile voyeur.

This video is well worth it for Paulik's and the other scenes mentioned above, and all of its episodes hold the gay male viewer's interest.  Whether one enjoys or deplores this kind of explicit sexuality (a matter about which, rightly or wrongly, no stand is being made here), the film is of undeniably good quality, even if not of any summit of production values such as script, music, or acting (beyond a bit of mime and, of course, the savoury and utterly believable real sexual acts performed).",1298678400,3,3661,5.188135593220339

7960971,3,B000065C1T,"I just got the box set the other day, and it's very well put together.  It's on 2 discs inside the regular paperboard box with the one end open.  I haven't watched the entire thing yet, but I've seen some of series 1 and some of series 2 to try to get a feel for the comedy overall.  Each disc has some extra material.  There's a look into the counter-culture comedy of the early 80's (of which Alfresco was a part of), cast bios that are fairly lenghty and indepth, and the first 3 episodes of the pilot series the show resulted from.  It's well put together.  There's episode selection and PLAY ALL on each disc.  There's even an lengthy insert that tells the backstory of the series and how it all came to be.

So, the set itself is top notch.  As always, Acorn Media has put together a very nice set here.

As for the show itself- it's VERY hit and miss.  A lot of the routines are just dreadful.  A lot of the jokes don't even make sense.  The laughs are more plentiful in Series 2 where they started to change the form of the routines.  They more closely fit the traditional sketch comedy formula.  I didn't love it that much as a whole.  There were some funny bits, but a lot of it I just watched and waited.  The laugh out loud parts never came.  I'd smile here and there for large chunks, but I don't think I laughed out loud once.  (so far)

I have a feeling this set was made simply because Hugh Laurie has made it big in the US with House.  He's got charisma, and you can see he has comedy chops.  I've never actually seen Fry and Laurie, but both men show talent and comedic timing here and there.  If the material was funnier, you might get a better idea of that talent.

I should also mention a lot of the genuine laughs in the show are ruined by the annoying laugh track.  Tho, honestly, I watched entire skits and didn't laugh at all, and kept waiting for the laugh track to kick in so I'd have some idea of when I was supposed to laugh (wondering if I just wasn't getting the British political humor of the time).  A lot of the times, the track never did kick in, and the skit itself felt like it wasn't aiming at comedy but just an attempt at being anti-establishment.

You do feel like you're watching a bit of history when you see the show.  I'm a big fan of the 80's, and tho I was a kid at the time, when you watch stuff from the early 80's like this, it feels like a big change was taking place.  Especially the British shows.  You feel like you're witnessing something historic, even if it's not all that funny in the end.

In the end, I'm probably being too hard on the show, it's not horrible. Don't get me wrong, a lot of it was unfunny and boring, but there were bright spots here and there, and I laughed a number of times from what I've seen so far. It's just that the laughs are too few and they don't come often enough to recommend it.  The performers all show great energy, and most of them clearly have great talent for comedy.

A well put together box set, some nice extra features, but the show itself isn't funny enough to warrant too much excitement.  Fans of Hugh Laurie, Steven Fry, Robbie Coltrane, and even Emma Thomspon will probably enjoy seeing these actors in their early years, but the comedy will fall flat for a lot of people.",1216598400,18,3276,4.20545746388443
