8232103,1,B000YDKAKI,"A no-budget Victory serial, ""Shadow of Chinatown"" (1936) has little to offer except the sinister presence of Bela Lugosi, whose lively performance as a Eurasian scientist cannot redeem 15 uneventful chapters. The condensed 70-minute feature is a slight improvement only for its brevity. Bela's first collaboration with low-rent producer Sam Katzman.",1338768000,,349,5.862745098039215
8232104,4,B000YDKAKI,"""Shadow of Chinatown"" is not likely to win any popularity contests, especially with pretty bad sound and picture quality, but the film is not often encountered, and is of interest on several levels.

The serial was produced in 1936 by Sam Katzman and directed by Robert F. Hill, one of the two released by Victory Pictures.  These came out right after the three produced by Weiss that year, which included ""The Amazing Exploits of The Clutching Hand.""  Victory's serials have the same look and feel, complete with the ""What happened to..."" titles at the chapter ends and the limited amount of background music that makes them seem even older than they are.  But while far from the quality of Republic and Universal serials they have interesting casts, and the plots are fairly complex.  They are also the ""missing link"" in the evolution of the Columbia serials, the first three of which were produced by Weiss.

The story involves European importing firms in San Francisco, hurting from Chinese competition, who think their problem can be solved by keeping Occidentals out of Chinatown.  They direct their business leader, an Eurasian woman named Sonya Rokoff (Luana Walters) to do this, and she hires another Eurasian, Victor Poten (Bela Lugosi), a scientist who needs money to continue his undisclosed experiments.  Poten employs some thugs in Chinese disguise to create mayhem, enough that the police will close Chinatown.  But newspaper reporter Joan Whiting (Joan Barclay) enlists aid of her friend, Martin Andrews (Herman Brix), a writer of a book about Chinatown, and they are immediately drawn into the action when Andrews' servant and information source, Willy Fu (Maurice Liu) is abducted by the thugs.  As might be expected, Victor Poten has his own agenda, involving a superior race of his own creation, and he soon takes over and expands the project, to the horror of Sonya Rokoff.  It may not make a lot of sense, but it keeps the plot boiling for fifteen chapters.

The cliffhangers are not the elaborately staged variety familiar from later serials, but neither was the story written for the express purpose of leading into them, nor did the writers feel compelled to include a fist fight in every chapter.  And unlike many serials, the plot still evolves in the later chapters; filler perhaps, but far more inventive than the commonly-used formula of having yet another battle between the hero and the same two underling bad guys.

Given the budget and speed with which these serials were produced, not much can be expected in terms of ""acting"" but Lugosi is in his element, with scientific devices including Television, in a form through which he can spy upon and hypnotize people.  Unfortunately the budget didn't allow his technical schemes to be emphasized; he often uses more direct methods, and while far from his most-compelling role he at least gets to wear several disguises.  It is odd that while dressed as a telephone repairman he would have to sneak in through the window to work on the 'phone; force of habit, perhaps.  Luana Walters plays her role well, and is effective in registering her dismay at Poten's methods and her helplessness in dealing with the situation.  Herman Brix gets to do something other than another ""Tarzan"" and is a capable hero.  Joan Barclay is stuck playing a chattering newspaper reporter, a variation on an unfortunate ""comic"" type found in movies of the 1930's; it isn't terrible but could have been better written.  There is some fairly humorous dialogue, even from Lugosi in a couple places and other humor, perhaps unintentional, such as the cliffhanger where the unconscious hero is imperiled by deadly rays from the sun, magnified through a goldfish bowl.  Maybe people in San Francisco are especially susceptible to death by sunlight.

Picture and sound of Alpha's DVD release are both fairly poor, especially in the first few chapters where adjustment of brightness and contrast is sometimes helpful.  The gray scale is usually sufficient to avoid losing all in darkness, and faces don't go blank.  The image is fairly fuzzy, and extends slightly beyond the edges of the screen; some words go missing in the chapter ""forewords"" but no problems with missing tops of heads.  Some film ""jumping"" is common during many of the opening credits, though it usually settles down fairly quickly.  There is spurious color, a slight blue-green cast not likely the original tint of the film.  Those who think it doesn't help can remove or modify it with controls on the TV.  But the picture is remarkably free from defects like scratches and dirt, and isn't too hard to watch.  The sound is a worse problem; it has speed and volume instability, a quavery ""wow/flutter"" noted mostly in the opening music, likely related to the jumpy picture since the music at the chapter ends sounds better.  It is fortunate that little background music is used, since the dialogue is hard enough to understand without it owing to lack of high frequencies and noticible distortion in some chapters.  Alpha's DVD was copied from a videotape, made obvious by a vertically-moving horizontal noise bar probably caused by a tape wrinkle, seen in Chapter 8.  It only lasts about a second; a minor defect and a miracle there is only one such noise bar.  The tape-to-DVD transfer couldn't cause all the quality problems; most are likely from the original transfer from film.  Still, the entire serial is present, reasonably watchable and currently supplied on two discs.  Alpha's ""complete serial"" edition, ALP 9546D consists of a shrink-wrapped package of the two volumes, ALP 4240D and 4241D.

A better transfer from the same film print is available from Sinister Cinema's website on DVD-R discs.  Sharpness and gray scale are both good, though scratches barely visible in Alpha's copy are a lot easier to see.  But it is also easier to see what's going on in the story.  Sinister puts their logo, ""SC"" in the lower-right corner of the screen for about the first four mintues, but it is small and of low contrast so not very annoying.  The sound is crisper, making the dialogue easier to understand, but it also emphasizes the distortion present in some parts of the original.

For those used to the slicker, more modern examples it takes some time and patience to adjust to the style of serials from Weiss and Victory.  Lugosi's later serials, ""SOS Coast Guard"" and ""The Phantom Creeps"" are easier to appreciate, but those tolerant of ""The Black Coin"" and ""The Clutching Hand"" should find ""Shadow of Chinatown"" fascinating.  As with all serials, it is easier to watch with a day or so between chapters; for those who want a ""whole story"" at once, a reasonably-edited 71-minute ""feature"" version is available from Alpha with fairly good picture and sound, ALP 4699D, but it skips many of the more-entertaining parts.  I give either complete edition the four star ""I like it"" rating; Alpha's efforts in making the entire serial available should be appreciated, it is on normal non-burned DVD's and fairly cheap.  But Sinister's edition is better, if somewhat more expensive, preferable for those who don't mind the ""burned"" media and rather plain packaging.",1283644800,2,7188,4.968253968253968
8232105,3,B000YDKAKI,"This serial is a mix of strangely facinating and dry as dust. The story is an odd one - a Eurasian woman (""Sonya Rokoff"") has the mundane goal of disrupting the tourist trade of the San Francisco Chinatown by using American thugs disguised as Chinese criminals. She hires a down-on-his-luck Scientist (Bela Lugosi as ""Victor Poten"") to give some technical help...and Bela takes the whole thing over, driving Sonya into the background of her own organization and even killing her agents when they displease him. Luana Walters plays ""Sonya"" is a very realistic way. She's a criminal...but Poten is a monster! She's unable to control him, and can only stand back and try to shield herself from his anger.

  But for all his seeming ability, Victor Poten is a very simple fellow. He wants to kill off all Asians and Caucasians and replace them with a superior race...but how? He's a master of disguise, hypnotism and can even excersize control of those he's hypnotised from great distances. He can mentally control the actions of a statue or robot with a limited ability, and has a dart gun and a gas gun. He's a master of chemistry and also has a room with crushing walls (just like any other mad scientist) but...how is that bag of tricks going to create a new race? He's like the Green Goblin but with Doctor Dooms goals.

  It's a cool enough serial, but the problem...is the Alpha Video transfer. It's clearly a straight recording from video (in chapter 8 the screen rolls once in a way I've only seen video tape do) and while not always terrible, the transfer's bad enough to be distracting. I've seen lots of Alpha Video releases, and not many of them are this bad. But...this is pretty bad.

  Still, it was an entertaining serial. The cliffhangers were kind of weak, but all the Asian characters are played by Asian actors...which was unusual for the time. If the transfer had been better I'd have given it 4 stars.",1270771200,2,1920,4.673590504451038
