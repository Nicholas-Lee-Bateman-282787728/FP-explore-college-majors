8338515,4,B001RPZDYK,"Rameau's music is wonderful and well led in this production by the Baroque master William Christie. I found the staging, though minimalist, interesting. BUT the dancing is so awful and distracting. After about 3 minutes of the non-stop frantic arm waving in underwear, I'd had enough and had to close my eyes during those parts (which were many). But since this music is not easy to get, I'd still recommend it. The singing and playing are very good.",1428883200,,450,4.782051282051282
8338516,3,B001RPZDYK,"Perhaps I expected too much of this performance; I've loved many French baroque operas---especially those performed by William Christie and Les Arts Florissants. This production, although benefiting from the conductor's excellent musical guidance, suffers at the hands of the stage director (Robert Carsen), stage and costume designer (Michael Levine) and particularly, the participation of the dance company La La La Human Steps.

I'm sympathetic to efforts to economize in staging these baroque pieces---but to do so by purging color from the stage seems to me self-defeating and ineffective. Between them, Carsen and Levine reduced all costumes to black or white, with color only allowed to the flowers that adorn the opening set---and which are soon plucked off the by chorus. The principals are initially all in severely tailored black coats or suits---which are discarded in favor of white nighties and pajamas at the end, when love, light (and revealed pedigree) triumph over tradition and those nasty winds.

In the principal roles Barbara Bonney (Alphise) and Paul Agnew (Abaris) provide many moments of beauty, but both are severely challenged by the necessary ornamentations of the baroque vocal line, especially at the high end of the scale; the rest of the cast are similarly afflicted.

But it is the dancing, or rather the lack of it that seriously mars this production. In my book, spastic semaphore does not count as dance, and this, for the most part, is what La La La provides. On and on it goes, not reflecting or augmenting the story line---wasting page after page of Rameau's beautiful music. Truly, Terpsichore must have wept to see this travesty.",1420329600,3,1670,5.200743494423792

8338518,5,B001RPZDYK,"As a newbie regarding the music of Rameau, I started with the very fine harpsichord Music  collection played by Belder which led me to this opera/dance performance. I think I was expecting something with powdered wigs and dances from an 18th century ballroom.  Wrong!

If you play the DVD without sound and asked someone to guess the composer of the music, I would bet nobody would guess ""Rameau"" even if given 100 attempts.  However strange at first, it works!  Initially I thought the costumes and dance was created by mike meyer's SNL character, Dieter, as a post-modern parody, but the music was so good that I stuck with it. Then after awhile I realized how well the production fit the music once the preconceived notions were discarded.

The DVD visuals, performances, and sound quality are very good (in my untrained opinion).  My final thought is that this is one of the best and most surprising opera DVDs that I have experienced.",1392508800,2,939,4.795031055900621
8338519,4,B001RPZDYK,"Yes, if someone just looked at the pictures, this production could seem like one of an endless stream of Eurotrash deconstructions of operas that have been given a little too much press (and indifferent recordings.)  But the production itself is far from disrespectful.  It attempts to portray the central conflicts in stylized ways that do not grate or mystify.  Though a few of the trappings seem to border on cliche--we may now safely put away all black leather coats that are tight around the waste and flair out to the tops of the shins and their matching black gloves--the sets, costumes (mostly), production values, even the odd choreography add up to a delightful version of a true rarity.  And the performances are top-notch, especially considering the tessitura of some of these roles.  Occasionally, someone sounds a bit strained here or there, but no more than a few seconds at a time, and they all fit together so well as a whole that carping seems silly.  Yes, the ""bad"" characters are highly stylized (some might say exaggerated, though on purpose) to act as foils against the ""good"" characters, who act in a more fluid, natural style, but the clash between the two mirrors the clash between the two groups of the opera, and it's quite often funny.  The music is masterpiece level, surely one of the great French Baroque works, and all singers give their (not inconsiderable) best.  The use of choruses is particularly delightful, as are the use of surprising props within the basic sets.  (Watch the planting, picking of the flowers.  If you are charmed or made to laugh, you'll enjoy the entire thing.  If you do not or are not, then you will NOT like the whole thing.)  Christie proves he is unequaled in this music and his musicians never let him down.  The variety of sounds, shapes, nuances, balances, etc. is staggering.  The separation between voices and orchestra is better in the surround mode, but the stereo is still quite good.  I saw a live performance of this when it toured.  Unlike this video, Christie came out for his bow in pajamas.  If you watch, you'll understand.  I finally bought a copy of the DVD.  Don't know why I waited so long.  Highly recommended for anyone not allergic to ""modern"" unrealistic productions.",1292716800,8,2253,4.802597402597403
8338520,5,B001RPZDYK,"Rameau is a genius theat deserve much more recognition and atention in musical history. His music is avantgarde not only in the baroque era but in modern times too, in certain moments it sound like Mozart or Haydn and in other times it prefigures late romanticism with his incredible use of orchestration in large orchestras with full winds and metals, percussion and an idiomatic use of the strings.
Les Boreades is the last work he composed and as on the other opera-ballets he created the story is full of masonic simbolisms. The music is outstanding and surprising, brilliantly performed by Les Arts Florissants and William Christie, one of the best french baroque experts in the world. The leading roles with Barbara Bonney and Paul Agnew are sublime. They are two singers with sensitive and pristine voices ideal for this refined and trascendental music. The actoral part is very well done too (not a constant in baroque opera world).
Another highlight is the art direction of Robert Carson who obtain a visual spectacle of high impact with a great aesthetic sense, freshness and vitality.
Les Boreades represents the perfect union of all arts, a truly masterpiece.",1249344000,12,1171,5.01025641025641
