8014062,5,B0001LJCHA,"this South americam story  shows how life, prejudices,can be cruel. Beutifully filmed in Venezuela (not Chaves one) you ca see how landlords act with people including their own Family once the rule are broken",1379548800,,208,5.117647058823529
8014063,5,B0001LJCHA,"I saw this film over 15 years ago, and it still resonates in my memory.

For me, Oriana was enchanting, and I returned to the theater to see it 4 or more time, unusual for me.

Impressions of this film may be very different.  This is a genre of mysteries of adolescence and discovery film, and for those with imagination who relish the leisurely unraveling of clues, this is a must see.",1182729600,3,386,4.333333333333333

8014065,5,B0001LJCHA,"Twenty years is relatively a short space of time, but perhaps enough to reflect about the grandess of this pecualiar and immortal artwork.
The feminine universe in my birthplace literally loads the atmosphere. Venezuela astonishes you due its freahness, captivating greeness, the spectacular Avila Mountain of two and a half kilometers height is a remarkable proof about this statement. You look it and your feelings change. You can walk through this mountain every weekened and feel the Earth Call.
So the charm, beauty and powerful gaze of the woman has captivated and engaged the literary world. From Gallegos to Uslar Pietri, from Bonalde a great poet to Camejo ( the reknown poet employed in 21 grams), the ingenuity and strength of the Venezuelan woman has resisted so many combats. most of them painful.
Fina Torres rescued through this intimate portrait a simple story of hopeless, disencounters, lack of affection and loneliness of Oriana told superbly in two planes. Yesterday and today are finely shown without any drop of soap melodram, a very well made script and solid performance of Doris Wells one of the greatest actress ever born in this country.
Fina Torres told a very common story told so many times and lived at least by thousands unknown women around the world. But this sad portrait allowed to show with all the possible freshness and charming visual poetry some unforgettable aspects of our citizenship. But beware that episode goes far beyond the limits of a nation to remain as silent witeness of the injustice and cross eyed disfunction in ancient generations of unfinished and anonymus stories through the little history.
A Latin gem!",1115856000,3,1663,5.072992700729927
8014066,5,B0001LJCHA,"El feminismo de Fina Torres unido a la belleza de paisajes venezolanos en tiempos dificiles para el amor entre seres diferentes socialmente en una sociedad machista, donde por encima de todo prevalece el respeto infundido por aos de educacin, anulando los sentimientos humanos, los cuales, cuando son de buena madera prevalecen en el tiempo. Ganadora en Cannes, es algo irrepetible por mucho tiempo en Venezuela.",1084924800,5,412,5.3538461538461535
