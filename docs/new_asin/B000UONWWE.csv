8214185,1,B000UONWWE,"Too bad you have to give one star - the IMDb ""Watch it now"" link shows BOB FOSSE'S ""ALL THAT JAZZ"" and it isn't even available as a video at Amazon; this is a rip-off!",1453334400,3,167,3.8

8214187,1,B000UONWWE,"WARNING!  This is NOT the 1979 film ""All That Jazz"" directed by Bob Fosse - it has been mislabeled.",1432080000,4,99,4.2105263157894735

8214189,1,B000UONWWE,This should not be called a movie.  What is depicted on the cover is all that was shown.  There was some jazz music playing in the background.  I am amazed that you are permitted to call it a movie.,1359504000,2,198,4.0256410256410255

We spent so much money on it and want to let folks see how great it looks. This Jazzy visual really helped set a great tone during cocktail hour. So easy to use, just put the DVD in and press play, couldn't be more simple!",1196812800,2,673,8.108108108108109
8214191,2,B000UONWWE,"The visuals are good but the menu is just to ""play feature"", then it starts with the jazz music and the shadow musicians and dancers later. It continues with other songs and goes back and forth between musicians and dancers. You cannot select tracks! All the music is on track 1 and it just continues. If you select track 2 or 3 it is the screen colorful visuals but they only play for about 1 minute.
This would have been much better if you had a menu to select each track or screen visual. The music isn't that good either. Track one is about a UFO. This disc is just ok. I won't use it.",1196467200,2,589,4.130434782608695
