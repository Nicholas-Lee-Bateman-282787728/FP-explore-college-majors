4518988,2,B00511N7B2,"It is not surprising that Showtime cancelled this show after three seasons. Tara somehow lost her way in Season 3. The only highlight of this season was Eddie Izzard's guest appearance as Tara's professor/therapist. The rest of the series...well, it just felt like the show was trying too hard. There was too much drama, too much craziness, too many altars, etc. ""United States of Tara"" ultimately became too over the top, even for a show about multiple personality disorder. That's saying a lot. RIP, Tara. :(",1308528000,6,510,4.941860465116279

4519092,1,B00511N7B2,"I am still watching the show because my choice of tv on amazon prime I haven't watched is getting thin. I get Tara has multiple personalities. But do they have to be so loud, obnoxious? Is there such a thing as a low key multiple personality that doesn't cause a scene each time it appears? I find this show embarrassing. I guess that's why it only lasted 3 Seasons. I do like Kate, the smart aleck teen daughter. I can understand her losing her s**t in that chaotic environment. I know MP is a bizarre affliction, but does she have to act so crazy 100% of the time? It grates on my nerves. Her sister Charmaine is such a narcissist. No one in this show is likeable with the exception of Neil & Kate.",1457308800,,700,4.231343283582089

She is playing so many different characters and switches so quickly but you're still on board as to who she is at that moment. To this day, I reference this show and could watch it over and over. I can't look at Brie Larson without thinking of Kate Gregson- one of my all time favorite television characters. This show is both endearing and heart breaking, and just straight up funny.

But I seriously want to slap most of the characters. Tara and her husband are so consumed with her illness that they are completely clueless about anything else. They have no idea what their kids are up to, and when they do find out, they don't get upset and they rarely punish them. Even when some of Tara's alters become violent, her husband barely reacts to it, and neither of them ever voice any concern that she may harm their children (even after she hits her daughter, it's like it didn't even happen). Tara's sister Charmaine...really, I don't have the words for this woman. I find it difficult to watch a show where most of the people are not likeable.",1444003200,,798,4.626760563380282

This 3rd Season i think was by far the best one especially with the new edition to her personalities The New Yorkian Therapist.  Soooo many laughs with the usual ones but I do not like this new male personality as much as i have come to  like the portrayal of the regular alters.  I hope to see a new season and not just a sudden drop off as the ending as many of my regular Cramadies (Drama/Comedy) have been doing in the last decade give or take.

4519182,3,B00511N7B2,"I don't know anything about DID, and I don't know how ""accurate"" the series portrays it, but this series was ... different - in a good way.  It was funny, really, but could be a bit of a black comedy; it wasn't scary, but had a lot of suspense; it wasn't cheesy - just when you thought that it was moving into sitcom territory and the family was too good and supportive to be true - the husband and kids got real (and the superficial sister was always real).  The emotions i felt while watching made me realize that the best thing about this show was the unexpectedness.  I was always clenched and on the edge of my seat.  Toni Collette is a total gem! I love the scenes where they allow her to be a different personality without the costume clothing, and it's so easy to tell who she is because her acting is just that great.  I'm just really glad to see that someone recognized her abilities and created an engine that would showcase that talent.",1417219200,,948,4.303370786516854

4519199,4,B00511N7B2,"Watching this series was difficult from the perspective of having DID. At first I couldn't relate to how it was portrayed but I understand now that they had to show the Parts the way they did in order to get the truth of the intensity that happens with this disorder. In the second and third season I could only watch it a little at a time because so much of it was so close to my own story.
To all of you who watched it thinking it was a joke, or just for fun, it was way too real to me. I some ways it was toned down, in others it was more intense (at least I think--I have no memory of a lot of my journey).
It came to the end way too quickly to tell the whole story but the intensity of her Parts was accurate up to the point of her deciding to get help. Most people with this disorder do not have such a supportive family.  Every one is different though.",1407888000,,859,3.9085714285714284

I am glad they returned to focusing on the family as a whole in the third season, as the sole focus being on Tara in the second season got a bit exhausting.

4519222,5,B00511N7B2,I am very glad I purchased this as I was wanting to learn more about multiple personalities.  It is both entertaining and educational.  I liked that the family is portrayed as being supportive of Tara as she changes into one personality and then another.  Toni Collette won an award for her performance of Tara and is well deserved.  Comic relief is interwoven with dark material throughout the series.  I believe it gives a fairly accurate picture of the struggles someone with dissociative identity disorder could go through.  Tara's case is an extreme case in any event.  A very well done production IMO.,1395446400,,607,4.892156862745098

4519233,5,B00511N7B2,"I was actually looking for something 'light' to watch when I chose the first episode of this series - and quickly discovered that this series is anything but light! But I was hooked - the idea of a caring wife, mother, sister and friend having to deal with multiple personalities along with all the associated fallout was truly intriguing. The writing and the acting are great but this series is definitely not for children (unless you factor in a significant amount of time explaining the difficult, quirky and often desperate situations in which the various characters find themselves).

4519248,5,B00511N7B2,This series is..well lets say a lot like watching a horrible train wreck over and over in slow motion. The content is moving yet horrifying. None of it is for children or people with weak constitutions. I started watching this series because of the 2 lead characters that I have seen in prior films/tv. It never dissapoints but afterwards I feel like I need an old disney marathon to level out my brain.,1382400000,,403,4.534246575342466

4519265,1,B00511N7B2,"I really enjoyed the first season of this show but after that it became the same old episode over and over.

The characters are all believable and include a wide spectrum of lifestyles in inclusive ways...except maybe the husband.  I wish the ""great cosmic script writers in the sky"" could create REAL men who are as supportive, talented and understanding as Max Gregson!

People and situations are presented with humor...humor about situations...humor that laughs WITH the characters, not AT them.  AND it is informative - in a general sense - about DID.",1373500800,,622,5.505263157894737

4519270,4,B00511N7B2,The show is very well written and performed. I was thoroughly entertained and would have continued to watch it if there were more seasons. This show makes a very dark subject seem light with witty banter and unique situational humor. I would recommend it.,1372636800,,255,4.818181818181818
4519271,2,B00511N7B2,"Some spoilers.

In season 3...to start, as others have pointed out, the lovely theme song has gone, which said ""We'll be just fine when we learn to love the ride"". I missed it to death, as it correctly described the tone of the show, which was not the same anymore. I guess, since they knew the theme didn't fit anymore, it was right of them to take it out, but it made the show's change all the more apparent. If you make it through the whole season, you'll notice that clearly there's no chance of anyone in the story loving the ride at this point. The show is so dark by the end I can't even take it.

At the beginning of the series, there were some dramatic parts, but a large portion of the show was still comedy, something that is lacking much of the third season. Not that the writers lost their sense of humor, as when there are funny scenes, they are hilarious, but they are also few and far between. Season 2 dealt with a little more drama than the first season but overall still had its charm. This season ended on a very dark note, and it was hard for me to watch the downfall of Tara and her altars. It was even harder for me to watch all the supporting characters, whom I have come to know and love along with their quirks, suffer and be saddened by the actions of Tara.

In terms of the dark tone, they did handle it well, and portrayed it very convincingly. But the show became so dramatic (and at times, even a little scary) that I just didn't like it anymore. I sat through to the last episode, though.

Basically, the show got dark. Really dark. And quite abruptly, too. And if, say, this was a DIFFERENT show about someone with multiple personalities, one that started off on a bleaker tone, I wouldn't have minded and might have enjoyed these storylines. But not to this group of characters. I couldn't enjoy it.",1371772800,2,1833,4.304347826086956

4519275,5,B00511N7B2,"Don't you hate it when a show just ends with no closure or respect for the audience. This is one of my biggest gripes with Network television. The show's just end. It doesn't matter if their in the middle of a cliff hanger or what, the network just pulls the plug and we're supposed to forget about  all the drama and connection we've built up and move on to their next money maker. Well, thankfully, Tara had closure. It's obvious that the ending could have been a launching for a new season, but it also was a credible ending for the show. The acting, the writing and the directing of this show has been wonderful and should be a model for other shows on TV. i admit that I never watched this show while it aired. I've become a binge watcher; I need to see shows back to back on my own schedule in order to get connected and Amazon makes that possible, so I've discovered many qualitty shows that I had previously over looked and Tara is one of the better one.

The one ray of hope in all of this vacuous hyperbole is the actress who plays Tara's daughter.  She has a natural, unforced charm, and, unfortunately, all the best one-liners.  Other than that, the story is a muddled mess, and the constant and relentless use of the F-word renders it useless and belies the poor intellect and/or creativity of the series' writers.  Once again we have Hollywood talking down to middle America.  I watched, only to see if it would ever get better (it did not) and it was free from Prime.",1363910400,4,735,4.6434108527131785

4519289,4,B00511N7B2,"The third season of ""United States of Tara"" is arguably the best of the series.  And unfortunately it is also the last season.  But it goes out with a bang, and is all-in-all worth it.

This season focuses on Tara returning to college to finish off the degree she never completed years ago.  At the same time, a violent new ""alter"" arrives that threatens not only Tara's stability, but also the lives of her other ""alters"", and even the lives of her friends and family.

This season is exquisite.  It's a huge step up from the slightly under-whelming second season, and ends the show on a strong note.  Even though it wasn't the intended end to the series, it does serve as an appropriate climax.

The DVD is what drops this season from a 5 (which is what the season deserves) down to a 4.

It's just too bare-bones for its own good.  There are barely any features.  Which sucks, because the quality of the show is so high, you'd think they'd have some interesting featurettes, interviews and commentaries.  I know the previous DVD's didn't have much, but they had some special features at least.  But I guess because the show was canceled, Showtime just skipped out on features to save time and money.  Oh, well.  Maybe someday we can get a boxed set that has some features...

Picture and sound quality is good.  (Much better than the disaster I had with the second season DVD- I got a bum copy that looked like crap and glitched constantly, so I have to buy a new copy sometime)

While the show and season deserve a 5 out of 5, this set is only a 4 out of 5 strictly for the disappointing, special-feature-less, bare-bones DVD.",1336003200,,1630,4.48639455782313

4519302,4,B00511N7B2,"Season Three of ""The United States of Tara"" takes a hard, dark turn. The show, one of my favorite cable shows in recent years, has always been unpredictable, and towing a fine line between quirky comedy and dark drama. With Season three, it definitely veers further into dark drama territory.

At the end of Season Two, Tara discovered the cause of her DID (horrific early childhood abuse by an older half-brother), and at the beginning of the season, it seems like Tara is ready to move on by returning to college to finish her degree. In the process, she meets an arrogant psychology professor (Eddie Izzard, in one of the show's best guest spots). Tara's relationship with the professor is the season's best storyline, since he starts off a non-believer in Tara's DID, then seeks to use it to advance his own career via an academic paper, and then, eventually, comes to feel genuine concern for Tara as her condition worsens and threatens her very life.

In each season, Tara has encountered new alters, and although all add a measure of chaos in her life, this season Tara's latest alter is her abuser, Bryce Crane, the psychopathic teenage half-brother who destroyed her life in the first place. For the first time, Tara has an alter who is more than just chaotic and inconvenient: Bryce, when he appears, seems hell-bent on not only destroying Tara's life, but the lives of everyone around her as well. In this way, the show makes a hugely risky creative leap, by making Tara herself the villain of the show. Bryce is so evil, sadistic, and without conscience that he may as well be a character out of a horror film.

Obviously, Tara's danger to herself and others affects her family, who, for the most part, are moving on with their lives more successfully than Tara. Charmaine is now settling down with Neil and her new baby, and although navigating life as a new Mom isn't easy, she seems to be showing new-found maturity. So is Kate, who finds a suitable job as a flight attendant, and falls for a single father. Marshall, now in his late teens, is probably less sympathetic this season than before, because as he starts to bloom as a filmmaker, he also starts becoming more judgmental and obnoxious. (When Tara's condition and a personal tragedy strike, Marshall comes down to earth and his inherent sensitivity seems to return.) Max's main struggle this season seems to be the burden of continuing to be the emotional rock for everyone around him, as well as caretaker for an increasingly destructive and ill wife. Although even his own Mother (Francis Conroy in a good but somewhat wasted cameo) advises him to let Tara go, Max is committed to staying with his wife and children.

As the Bryce alter wreaks havoc on everyone's lives, it becomes increasingly unclear what's really going on psychologically. Is Bryce's murder of Tara's other alters a way of cleaning the slate so that Tara can finally live a life on her own? Or is Bryce Tara's way of truly, completely self-destructing? One thing the show has never offered were clear, easy answers when it came to Tara. She's always been a complicated, messy, unpredictable, chaotic character, and Toni Collette's performance has always anchored and elevated the show. Every single outrageous plotline written for her, she's pulled off brilliantly.

Since Showtime decided not to renew the series, the third season also serves as the final season, with the last episode serving as not only the season finale, but the series finale as well. Although when the season finale was conceived it was probably up in the air whether or not the show would be back, kudos to the writers for giving the viewers and fans enough closure with the last episode be able to gracefully close the book on this series' somewhat brief, yet entertaining and adventurous, run.",1313366400,3,3815,4.809451219512195
4519303,2,B00511N7B2,"If only I were in the writer's room meeting when they decided they hated all of the characters and wanted to ruin their lives. Perhaps I could have convinced them that was a bad idea. I knew things were going to be different when the opening theme song--""I know we'll be just fine, when we learn to love the ride""--was now conspicuously absent. Little did I know, but the song was the first beloved component of the show that would be systematically eliminated over the next 12 episodes.

More on the horror below, but first the positives: the acting is still top-notch. Toni Collette knows no bounds. And when the writers remember the original purpose of the show, the dialogue is smart and witty. Kate (Brie Larson) shows a lot of maturity this season and Max (John Corbett) gets a lot more screentime as the show explores his motivations for staying with Tara all these years. Anyway, now the bad:

**spoilers ahead**

The show went through a change between the first season and the second season. It became a little more dramatic, brushing many of the earlier comedic elements to the side. But it managed to retain its black humor and had some really moving scenarios and winning acting, especially from Rosemarie DeWitt.

The tonal shift between the first two seasons and this third, though, is drastic, unexpected, and ultimately horrifying, especially during the last half of the season as you watch multiple characters you've grown to know over the past two years (even if they are just in Tara's ahead) get brutally killed off.

Even if the show hadn't been canceled, I don't see how it could continue. Tara's destruction scattered her family across the country. Even the magic of television doesn't have the power to bring them back together.

The final scene of the show is profound, set to Supertramp's ""The Logical Song."" ""When I was young, it seemed that life was so wonderful--a miracle. It was beautiful, magical... But then they send me away to teach me how to be sensible, logical, responsible, practical... Won't you please, please tell me what we've learned? I know it sounds absurd. But please tell me who I am.""

These lyrics beautifully sum up the show to a T (no pun intended). As Tara decides to travel to Boston for professional help, you know it isn't going to be for three months. It's going to be a lifelong journey, and it probably won't ever get better.

What did we learn on this three-year journey with the Gregson family? That everything is just pointless and absurd? This family tried so hard, and for what? The show started with a family that loved and supported their wife/mother/sister even though she was, in a word, crazy. There was always a sense of hope and optimism. But the final season makes it all moot, morphing the theme into one of hopelessness and desperation. The family failed. It's devastating. Why even try?

""But I'm thinking so logical... It's getting unbelievable.""",1313280000,2,2922,4.781746031746032

4519305,3,B00511N7B2,"Spoiler Alert!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
When there were only whispers about a new show to be created about a woman dealing with multiple personality issues, I was the first voice in my social circle to announce that this would be a great show. When the first advertisments for the show hit magazines and newspapers I grabbed them and pinned them up on my bullentin board as a reminder to watch.  As a huge fan of Toni Collette I was thrilled to see that she would be the star of this new original series and thus I was all the more excited about its premier. Season 1 did not disappoint.  The show was funny, it discussed a serious issue but it stayed upbeat and hilarious all the way through.  I purchased Season 1 and threw a party at my house so that all of my crew could see it and EVERYONE loved it.  A few of my friends and family members went as far as to purchase a Showtime package, just to catch the show when its new seasons premiered. Season 2 was just barely a complete disappointment. Suddenly the show got too serious, it became a drama about a woman suffering from this ailment.  Her homosexual son was falling apart because of his mother's condition and so there just wasn't much to laugh at anymore. I was happy to see Marshall in Season 2 enter into a serious relationship and then I was disappointed to see that relationship fall apart in Season 3.  Is a gay teenage boy in love such a problem that not only did they have to break Marshall and Lionel up, but they had to kill Lionel as well? That sooo did not work for me.

Season 3, wow. I laughed, but overall I was still just as disappointed as when I finished Season 2. The ""Alters"" are funny, Eddie Izzard is funny and yet somehow the show managed to dampen all the hilarity.  It is a shame that such a good idea went awire. Tara was a great character and again her Alters are funny, but they were not utilized to their full potential. I love John Corbett, he is great in everything he does, and his character never failed to entertain. I never did get with Brie Larson's character -it always seemed as if she was reaching for her place in the show and never quite getting there. Rosemarie Dewitt's character was weak as well, not as weak as Brie, but still she too was a character reaching and never quite grasping.

Marshall -played by Keir Gilchrist -was another character that was interesting, unique and intriging but not used to full capacity.  There was so much going on in Marshall's world and in Marshall's mind his story along side his mother's could have made for a great long lasting series. Oh Well, if Life were perfect we wouldnt look forward to Heaven.",1312675200,,2631,4.40618556701031
4519306,5,B00511N7B2,"Season 3 has unexpectedly become the final season of one the greatest shows to come along in a long time. Was United States of Tara perfect...no, but the show had something that other Showtime shows did not...it had guts. The guts to not repeat the exact same formula season after season (ex. Dexter & Nurse Jackie). Sadly if U.S. Tara would have repeated the same formula it created in season 1 it would probably have kept its viewers and not been cancelled. The American viewing public seems to prefer....well I digress. Season 3 stands as the strongest season of U.S. Tara...though season 2 is my personal favorite, season 3 is the most fast-paced, dark, complex, and well-written season of the show. It's tragic that this show was cancelled when it was at its very best.

I won't go over the entire plot line or give any major spoilers, but the main arch of the season involves Tara returning to college to complete her degree, the revelation that she didn't complete her degree the first time around because she attempted suicide, the emergence of a mysterious & violent alter, and an all out war inside Tara's head for control. The storylines for the other family members have always tended to be weak, contrived, or ridiculous (Kate on a cake, season 2 for example), but in season 3 the writers seem to have finally found interesting storylines for the family members...though granted their storylines are far less interesting than Tara's story. Kate finally makes the transition into adulthood and while there isn't much exciting in her storyline, it is believable and refreshing. Marshall and Max on the other hand have interesting storylines that involve their internal conflicts in dealing with Tara's disorder and with each other. I found myself really disliking Marshall this season, but completely understanding his motives and actions. Charmaine becoming a mother gives her the most interesting and humorous storyline she has had in all three seasons.

So on to the heart of the show...Tara. This season Tara is paired up with her college professor played brilliantly by Eddie Izzard. Izzard challenges Tara and the alters by expressing his disbelief in her disorder, but then he slowly becomes the one person that Tara and the alters seek out for help. The interaction between Tara and her alters is also taken to a higher level of co-consciousness this season with Tara interacting with nearly all of the alters and the alters interacting with each other. I enjoyed this dynamic and it worked to reveal the nature of the system inside of Tara and we learned more about the roles each alter has in protecting Tara. *Spoiler* The show dives into very dark territory with the emergence of Tara's violent alter that is based on the half-brother that tormented her as a child and caused her disorder. Toni Collette is excellent at playing the psychopathic 14-year old Bryce.

The ending is where I do have an issue...only because now it has to serve as a series finale instead of just a season finale. I thought the final episode ""The Good Parts"" would have made an excellent season finale, but I disagree with the people that say that it also works as a series finale. There is so much left unanswered and as someone that has loved this show since it first began airing...I am a bit bitter that this is where it all ends. We still don't know exactly what Bryce did to Tara and Charmaine as children...I know that other characters in the show and the critics that review the show state that Bryce ""molested"" Tara, but simply being molested is not enough to cause D.I.D. We also never get to uncover how much Charmaine has repressed (like why she was terrified of basements, etc). Plus we also never get to learn the origins of Buck, T, and Gimme. We know that Alice was based on Mimi...but the others are still a mystery.

Overall season 3 is the strongest season of U.S. Tara and definitely worth owning. Tragically this show was ended before its time. There are many unanswered questions and Tara...you will be missed.",1312502400,14,4032,4.797122302158273
4519307,4,B00511N7B2,"Judge Clark Douglas, DVD Verdict-- Well, United States of Tara, it was a good run. Alas, after three increasingly ambitious seasons of entertaining television, Showtime has pulled the plug on the program that had quietly turned into its best show (though this is largely due to the fact that Dexter's wheel-spinning has become frustrating and Weeds has wandered off into shark-jumping territory). Those of you who have been watching the program on DVD (as I have) undoubtedly have an important question to ask: ""How well does it end?""

Without digging into spoilers, permit me to say that United States of Tara ends rather well under the circumstances. Yes, there is one significant unresolved plot thread and one is made rather curious about where a fourth season would have gone, but the finale works quite well given the unexpected nature of the cancellation. It's a touching, cathartic capper to a most intriguing season. The show's third go-round frequently swings for the fences, whiffing in a silly manner on occasion but knocking it out of the park just as often.

The DVD transfer is a typically sturdy TV-show release, boasting strong detail, bright colors, acceptably deep blacks and natural flesh tones. Audio is similarly sturdy, spotlighting dialogue and an appreciably understated soundtrack (speaking of which, I miss the show's inventive theme song--who decided to kill that offbeat charmer?). There are no extras included.
