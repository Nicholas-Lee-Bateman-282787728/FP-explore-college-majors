8543041,4,B009MP87FY,"Very arty. Quite vivid and disturbing at times. I'm not a huge fan of explicit gore, and this .....had its moments... (always in service to the plot).
Still, a stylish and at times erotic, indie-noir.
I don't regret buying the DVD. Even if I'm personally unlikely to rewatch it much. No real need, since it's seared in my memory like every Cronenberg movie I've ever seen. :)
Know what you're getting into before you watch it. It's vivid. It's at times disturbing. But it's a film that draws you in and won't let you go until the end.... and even then... there's certainly potential for a sequel or franchise here.... but personally, I'm good with just the one.
The production values are sumptuous and the acting is quite good. It's a first-class production in every respect.
Maybe the reason it's not better known is that the subject matter is very, very, VERY noir.
Still, I see no reason why this shouldn't become, at least, a cult classic.",1495065600,,943,4.652694610778443

8543043,5,B009MP87FY,"Mesmerizing study of power, domination and submission. A hypnotic, devastating femme fatale. Luscious production and cinematography.",1483833600,2,132,7.3125
8543044,3,B009MP87FY,The movie is not about what the trailer promotes it as. It is more about criminals double crossing each other.,1439337600,2,110,4.55
8543045,1,B009MP87FY,"Sucked. Horrible and misogynistic. Poorly made, poor acting, poor effects. Not a good erotic movie to watch as a couple or otherwise. Couldn't get a refund and can't get back those few minutes I wasted watching and ff through part of this garbage.",1423958400,,247,4.767441860465116

8543047,2,B009MP87FY,"The plot and storyline was ok,  and I  was fine with it until the woman just gets ripped apart while being poisoned from the much sought after artifact the the movie revolves around. The senseless drawn-out torture of the villains own assistant was back stabbing taken too far. Not for the faint hearted.",1416700800,3,304,4.716981132075472

8543049,2,B009MP87FY,"It's an okay movie, with lots of exotic themes. But my main gripe is that there's a misprint on the cover, stating that there are three separate language tracks, including Mandarin, French and English. This is wrong. There is one language track, with Mandarin, French and a little bit of English on it. And the entire thing is subtitled in English. I bought this movie in the hopes of turning off the subtitles and watching it in English, but it's just not possible. But my seller was understanding and allowed me to return it for a full refund.",1409184000,,545,4.571428571428571
