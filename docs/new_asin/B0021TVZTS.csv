3841476,5,B0021TVZTS,"I loved it.  I liked the format.  Split into headings that refer to the different experiences, ie., The tunnel of light, beings, Love, etc (Those aren't the exact headings, but you get the gist), then the person recounts their individual experience.  It also has a background of Dr Moody speaking to a man whose father is ill, and he writes him a letter about the book 'Life After Life'.  Then his dies a few weeks later and the father's final words sum up the movie perfectly .... ""The Light"".

Very uplifting for me, even though I've heard many testimonies, I still love hearing them.  Some of these, I had not heard before.",1405036800,9,626,4.544642857142857

A good book to read after this primer would be ""Journey of Souls"" but Dr. Michael Newton. Definitely a level up from this book, but both are great in there own ways.",1402531200,3,328,4.222222222222222
3841478,2,B0021TVZTS,80-90s movie. Problem it was split up in to many directions. Nice if they sat down with one person told his or hers entire story then go on to next. Instead hogpoj. Kind of boring as well and I live this stuff. There's enough out there to avoid this movie. Do not pay. For it,1399248000,2,275,4.0181818181818185

3841480,5,B0021TVZTS,"I have seen this video numerous times and have copies of it. It is priceless. The filmmaker interviews Dr. Raymond Moody, the author of the book ""Life After Life,"" and six more credible, well-spoken people who had Near Death Experiences. These are actually death experiences because the people have been pronounced dead and have flat-lined. Among these are Dr. Moody's medical school student, Dr. George Ritchie, and Dannion Brinkley. Ritchie, at age 21, died in an Army hospital in Texas, but traveled as far as Mississippi (without any form of physical transportation) before turning back to the hospital in Texas to find his body when he realized something was awry. What a shame there are no copies available to teach others through real-life accounts what happens at the point of so-called death. They verify the existence of a soul, therefore the continuation of life, and more.",1258416000,,884,5.061643835616438

3841499,3,B0021TVZTS,"Life After Life is a short documentary inspired by Dr Raymond Moody's classical book of the same title. Moody has spent decades researching and documenting near death experiences (NDEs). He is featured in this program, discussing the NDE phenomenon with filmmaker Peter Shockey. Life After Life also contain interviews with six people who had near-death experiences. One of them is the controversial Dannion Brinkley, author of Saved by the Light, who worked as Moody's secretary for a period. Another is a former Soviet dissident, who claims to have been murdered by the KGB! The documentary also mentions Carl Gustav Jung's NDE, described in his book Memories, Dreams, Reflections.

Life After Life describes the various phases of an NDE, including the initial out-of-body experience, during which the dead person sees himself from the outside, the tunnel of light, the life review and the meeting with the being of light. None of the interviewees wanted to return to their mortal bodies, but were told to do so by the angelic being. While Moody's original book had described NDEs as wholly positive, some negatives are briefly mentioned in this documentary. Several of the persons interviewed experienced Hell as a kind of complete darkness and emptiness, or separation from God.

I read the book Life After Life about 20 years ago, found it intriguing, but then put it aside since it didn't compute with my atheist-materialist worldview. Brinkley's book I considered nuts! Today, I'm more positive towards this material. But then, I'm no longer a materialist.

NDEs are certainly strongly suggestive of the ability of consciousness to survive bodily death. While people often fill in the details based on their religious views or those of their surrounding culture (plain Christians see the Christ, Mormons see pre-existent souls, atheists see a nameless being freely based on Jesus-meek-and-mild from Sunday school), the NDEs do seem to follow a relatively consistent pattern. And yes, the out-of-body experiences are difficult to explain in a materialist manner  unless you postulate the existence of a body double made out of astral matter (whatever that might be).

Life After Life contains little that is new to those already familiar with Moody's work (and the work of other pioneers in this field, such as Melvin Morse or Michael Sabom), but it could be of some interest to those not previously exposed to the NDE phenomenon.",1424736000,3,2436,5.188295165394402
3841500,5,B0021TVZTS,"To me, this is exceptional.  It appears to credibly explore what lies beyond.  The credibility comes from the  many subjects who had near death experiences as discussed by Dr. Raymond Moody.",1413244800,,190,5.064516129032258

8349471,2,B0021TVZTS,"I like the topic of life after death and Dr Moody's research, but this movie is boring and unfocused. If you are like me, I.e. more or less familiar with the near death experiences in general, you likely won't find anything new there. The six stories are stretched and repeated over and over, way too much. Same amount of information could have been delivered in 10 minutes with less irrelevant dramatization. Only watch it if you are a novice and have no idea about this topic. Otherwise, save yourself some time.",1480377600,,514,4.65934065934066

8349474,3,B0021TVZTS,"Older documentary which highlights the NDE phenomenon and really brings quite a lot of hope and happiness to death.  The pacing is slow.  The cut-scenes between interviews are terrible.  In fact, the title screens have scary music, even though everything recounted is quite calming and reassuring.  What is that all about?  And the film attempts to frame the interviews within the context of a man writing his father a letter.  That was the most useless, wasteful flaw.  We could have heard from more NDE experiencers!

But the people we do hear from come from very different walks of life and died in various ways.  Their tales are matter-of-fact, sometimes odd, but always comforting.  The process of death is harder on the living than the deceased, and maybe harder on those who choose to come back to finish their lives.

Worth listening to.  Fast forward the immature title screens.",1476835200,2,887,4.918918918918919
