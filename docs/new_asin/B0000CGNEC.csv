1919650,5,B0000CGNEC,"In simple, this show is the best comedy on TV in many years. Fans of REAL comedy, TRUE comedy will enjoy this DVD and the show at first watch. The cast is entirely enjoyable and funny. Jerry Stiller needs no write up. You know him and his style. If you're a fan, you have no worries. Leah Rhemini and the assorted cast of friends on the show are all well played and sure to deliver laughs every week.
Main charcter Doug Heffernan (Kevin James) maintains a classic style of comedy people love from Don Rickles, Chevy Chase and John Belushi. This is the close thing to the Honeymooners since... the Flinstones. Same thing. Everybody Loves Raymond has won the awards, but when it comes to laughs and truly funny comedy; there is no comparison. Raymond and Becker pale in relation. I like to think I know comedy very well. That being said, I have NEVER watched this show and not laughed a good amount of times. It's the only show I've followed for more than a couple of seasons. It's timeless comedy and it's run on the air for over 6 years is proof it's not going anywhere. (Hopefully CBS reads that)
Enjoy. This is a terrific show to watch and own. Kevin James is the King of Queens and the King of Comedy. (I am not related to, nor work for Kevin James. No, I'm not a stalker either)",1070064000,18,1282,4.345833333333333
1919651,4,B0000CGNEC,"Thank you for that show!
I love it, really. It's the funniest show on TV I've ever seen.
It shows real live. With all options. Good times - bad times - ups and downs.
I am from Austria - not Australia - and sometimes it's hard for me to understand all the jokes, but it is ok. I'm a great fan of that comedy.
At the end. If you know ""king of queens"", just try to get Kevin James' solo program: Sweat the small stuff. It's Great!",1069372800,9,428,3.9310344827586206
1919652,5,B0000CGNEC,"Kevin James and Leah Remini have great chemistry together.  Lately, on television sitcoms, it has become the norm to team up average looking husbands with wives that are babes.  This show succeeds with that formula because these two are believable as a married couple.  The writing is excellent, and the characters are all very funny in their own way.  Victor Williams is great as Doug Heffernan's best friend, Deacon Palmer.  Patton Oswalt as Spence, is also superb.  The whole cast just works!  I will definitely pick up this DVD for my collection, and will be waiting on the next few seasons to be released on DVD as well!",1068768000,6,625,4.731481481481482
1919653,4,B0000CGNEC,"I didn't start watching ""The King of Queens"" right away. I knew it was from the producers of two my of all-time favorite sitcoms ""Mr. Belvedere"", and ""Ned & Stacey"", and yet I didn't get around to watching it until the end of the first season. Even then I only watched it because a TV buddy of mine kept urging me to check it out because he thought I might get into the show like I did with Ned & Stacey. It took a few episodes, but The King of Queens eventually grew on me, becoming my must-see Monday night comedy. In fact, it's the only comedy that I watch on CBS. Everybody loves Raymond, except me. For me, The King of Queens really was the King of CBS Monday night comedy. CBS, stupidly,  moves the show to Wednesdays this season. But, I digress.

""The King"" is Doug Heffernan, a hefty IPS parcel driver played with great comedic cluelessness by comedian Kevin James. James is hilarious with his dopey facial expressions and reactions. Doug lives in Queens with his wife Carrie, a legal secretary played with gusto by Leah Remini - who FINALLY found a sitcom that truly suits her spitfire talent. Doug's happy home is usurped by the presence of his father-in-law Arthur Spooner played by Jerry Stiller, who basically does what he did in Seinfeld, but somehow makes it still seem fresh in this show. I crack a smile at how he always greets Doug with ""Douglas.""

Doug & Carrie's marital dynamic is reminiscent of Ralph and Alice Kramden from The Honeymooners. Physicalities aside, the similarities are undeniable. Doug and Ralph are both hefty, hard-working, blue collar guys who both drive for a living, with schemes that always incite their wives. Alice and Carrie both have spitfire personalities, and are not afraid to speak their minds, and yet totally devoted to their husbands. Doug's friends Deacon Palmer (Victor Williams), Spence Olchin (Patton Oswalt), and cousin Danny Heffernan (Gary Valentine - Kevin James' real-life sibling) alternate as Ed Norton facsimilies.

The episodes themselves have a quirky charm that fans of Newhart and Ned & Stacey will appreciate. Given Ned & Stacey's premature demise, I didn't want to get attached to another Michael J. Weithorn show, because I didn't think it would last. That was five years ago, and the show is still on the air. With this DVD, I can now see all of those original episodes that I missed out on complete and uncut. And so can you. Long live The King of Queens!",1064275200,19,2430,4.697183098591549

1919668,4,B0000CGNEC,"This laugh-out-loud comedy stars Kevin James and Leah Remini as married couple Doug and Carrie Heffernan. During their days, Doug's a parcel deliveryman and Carrie's a legal assistant; during their nights, they come home to Queens and Carrie's eccentric widowed father Arthur (Jerry Stiller) who recently moved in with them.

Storylines follow the usual marital dispute route (e.g. home responsibilities, money and sex), dealings with the eccentric Arthur or Doug's best friends Deacon, Spence and Richie. The four can typically be found at Cooper's, the local bar/billiard hangout.

As an added bonus, the episode ""Road Rayge"" is a crossover with Everybody Loves Raymond, as Doug meets Ray (Ray Romano) during a mishap at the DMV.

For an engaging and true-to-life show with lots of laughs, be sure to check out this series!",1459209600,,825,5.234848484848484

1919684,1,B0000CGNEC,"Kevin James is a very touch and go actor. i think the best actor comparison for him would be Jack Black. not just because they are both morbidly obese, but because only half their stuff is worth watching, the rest isn't memorable whatsoever. i received this as a birthday present a few years ago from a friend, who said she thoroughly enjoyed it and thought i would too. i had never opened it at all...until today. thank goodness i am anonymous on here and she will not know who i am, because i do not rate this television show whatsoever. it's almost like a recycled, poor mans ""Everybody loves Raymond"". the observational humour, the neurotic wife. it's almost like a direct copy, minus the likability. this show even has the token African American needed to give the show culture. and funnily enough, Deakin is the only character i somewhat enjoyed the presence of because, unlike the rest of the characters played, he seemed somewhat normal and not deranged.

the show revolves mainly around Doug Heffernan (Kevin James) and his incompetence. he works for the parcel delivery service UPS. that in itself makes me wonder, but also worry. UPS probably hire people like this guy in real life, which probably explains why Amazon parcels become missing and delayed: because there are people like him with that much ineptitude that are delivering them. throughout the course of the show, i could not help notice Jerry Stiller. if you don't know him, you're living under a rock. he is renowned in the world of comedy, and is recognised as for his talents in satirical and blue humour. but whether he's become senile, he's getting paid quite handsomely, or he's totally lost his marbles due to old age, i cannot see how or why he would agree to a script like this. Jerry Stiller is a very funny man - he has done stand up many times at venues such as ""The Laugh Factory"", which i have seen on youtube. he is/was hilarious. yet now i see him starring in a sitcom playing ""crazy grandpa"". it's actually quite...quite sad.

this is my personal opinion. the concept of sitcoms has been done, this one brings no new humour to the table that you haven't already seen in ""Everybody loves Raymond"" and ""Seinfeld"", and while i'm not the biggest fan of either of those aforementioned titles, i do think they are better than this one. i don't want to write it off completely. i genuinely do not want to deter people that enjoy Kevin James or this show. i just do honestly think that if you stumbled upon this sitcom with no clue what it's about, i urge you to look a bit further as there are better ones out there.",1444867200,,2599,4.587096774193548

The transfer quality of this DVD set wasn't exactly stellar but that doesn't take away from the hilarity. While this season doesn't have quite as many laughs as #2 and #3 for example, James, Reminii and Stiller hold it together and by the last few season episodes it seems most have come to either love it or hate it.

1919715,1,B0000CGNEC,"I bought a season of this series on the strength of overwhelmingly positive customer reviews. Different strokes for different folks...My educated demographic guess is that this is for children and people who've never set foot in a college classroom. And that's ok; everyone should have comedy they can relate to.

The funniest comedy series I've been watching lately is Not Going Out, a British series that's less sanitized and a bit quicker.

I did learn something from watching The King of Queens. It's not that I hate laugh tracks, it's that I hate laugh tracks that are incessantly playing when nothing funny has happened. And Ben Stiller's dad, a central character in this show, is playing to the cheap seats in a Catskills auditorium in the 1950's. Comedy from another, slower century.",1376438400,,791,4.984848484848484

1919779,5,B0000CGNEC,"Not since the haydays of Jerry Seinfeld & co. has television seen a comedy with this much ability to ""deliver"". While K of Q is much more of a regular sitcom than Seinfeld, somehow its magic is just that - its normalness. Like Seinfeld, this show has the ability to take the most banal of everyday scenarios and spin them into some of the most brilliant moments of comedy. Case in point here may be found in one of the bonus episodes - 'Assaulted Nuts' - found in this 1st season disc set. This episode is actually taken from the second season, and uses a storyline which depicts main character Doug having an unfortunate incident with an item of regular desk stationery. During a meeting with a banker, which Doug is forced to attend by wife Carrie, a delusional Doug manages to spin a conversation about the most boring of bank details into one which communicates to him on a very, um, personal level. The results are laugh-out-loud funny.

While it never hurt K of Q's cause that Carrie/Leah Remini is ultra-hot (I'll admit that it was catching a glimpse of Leah during an advertisement that first made me tune into the show), that fact is in reality such a small part of what makes the show worthy of a watch. I've never been able to quite put my finger on what sets the show apart from the pack but this 1st season is well worth your money and some of the best television comedy that you'll find from recent times.",1171843200,3,1419,4.436781609195402

It took a blizzard and my friend's box of DVD's to get me to watch the first two seasons. We started watching them and man oh man was I hooked. First of all Kevin James is one of the funniest guys I have seen on TV in the past few years. He's just full of energy and best of all you get this vibe that he's just playing himself and it's not an act so it's extra funny. Leah Remini is perfect as Kevin's wife cause she is a very unique actress and supports the show well.

Now everything I see Jerry Stiller in he automatically sticks out, I really don't think he can help it since he has a very loud voice and makes it clear what he wants. It's crazy how Jerry Stiller actually acts the same way he did in Seinfeld when he was George's dad but he's still hilarious as Carrie's dad. What's even funnier is how Doug (Kevin James) is always hungry and will do whatever for a good meal, like leaving Carrie in the rain after she just got her hair done just to get an apple pie with hot fudge on it.

Many fat jokes, but they don't hurt Doug, they bounce off him. The relationship between Doug and Carrie seems are real as can be. Not like other sitcoms where the actors have no chemistry. My favorite character has to be Jerry Stiller. His outbursts, and schemes are classic. For example, in one episode he freaks out about his deodorant and has the company on the phone, and gets dough involved. Another sees him and spence invisioning the rise and fall of a business they haven't even started yet. And as others have mentioned the cereal skit between him and dough rules. There's 2 cameos by ray ramano and they are great. Doug helps ray pass a driver's test in on episode, and another has ray taking doug to a country club to golf and rays parents come over dougs house at one point! The DVD packaging is great.

This show is brillant, mainly because it doesn't try to hard to make you laugh.  From a guys view, most of the stuff that Doug does in the show, I have personally done at one time or another.  Arthur (Jerry Stiller) is absolutly hilarious as Carrie's (Leah Remini) father.  Everybody has met an old person like Arthur before.  Oh yeah, speaking of Leah Remini, she is so damn hot and funny. She is the kind of girl that I would want to marry.  A girl who can be a really big pain, but at the same time is very, very sexy.
The best moments of the show are when Doug and Arthur are arguing with eachother.  i.e. Doug bought cereal that had 3-D glasses in them.  Arthur got the 3-D glasses but didn't have the box that was in 3-D.  Doug had it.  So they tried to compromise taking turns, but they ended up fighting over them and breaking the glasses and the cereal box.

I sat down and watched the whole set in 2 sittings, the time just flew by.  And best of all just when you're sad theirs no more eps to watch you look at the extras and you see 2 more eps hidden! =D
The character development throughout the first season is great author is such a character ( as are everyone ) I remember author is sitting at the table and tells Doug he would like to go to ""dominoes"" and Doug's like who and realizes its dominos.  Author is just way to funny and highly paranoid and goes overboard pretty much every episode.  And you have Spence (a guy who is in his 20's and lives at home with his mom) who is also a great addition to the show (the Valentines Day episode is truly evil for him!).  And of course the whole show is full of moments of true greatness. The Thanksgiving Day episode was funny from beginning to end as are most episodes.
Some reviewer said the video quality was bad on these DVDs, id have to disagree, I have a big ws high def tv and even though I had to watch the DVDs in 4:3 mode the quality was still decent ( I mean the show was shot in 98 and like most sitcoms they didn't use high def back then ). The audio is very clear also.
This whole set is very much worth the price. You would be hard pressed to be this entertained for less than $1.50 an half hour!

It's also nice to see a show where the black characters aren't just tossed in to show just how liberal the main characters are.  Deacon and Kelly are Doug and Carrie's friends, period.  No lame racial stereotyping.

The best thing about this collection is that the episodes can be watched several times, and they only get funnier.  When there is nothing on TV (all the time), we will pop in one of these DVDs and laugh ourselves silly.
In addition, the DVDs come with some good special features -- a few bonus episodes and some extra commentary.
Compared to more recent episodes of the show, the first season is funnier.  Carrie is meaner in the newer episodes, and Arthur Spooner shows up a lot less.
My favorite episode from this collection is Carrie's birthday episode, in which Doug throws a party together for her at the last minute.  I think I've watched that episode thirty times by now.  ""I've just written myself into a corner"" has become part of my vernacular.

It is definitely a keeper and well worth having in one's collection.
Kevin James plays the role of the role of the portly, but adorable, Doug Heffernan, an International Parcel Service delivery guy and  husband to the earthy and sexy Carrie (Leah Remini), who clearly rules the roost. They live in a modest house in Queens, one of the outer boroughs of New York City.  Carrie's father, the idiosyncratic Arthur Spooner (Jerry Stiller), for reasons made clear in the pilot episode, also joins their household. His living with them adds to the many comedic moments of this popular television series. There is a funny group of friends, odd neighbors, and other assorted characters that drift in and out of the Heffernans' daily lives, adding to the comedic zest of this comedy series about middle class life in one of the outer boroughs of New York City.
The casting is perfect. The series is very funny with well-written scripts and excellent performances by its very talented cast. What more can a viewer ask for? This is an excellent, value laden, three disc DVD set, replete with a pilot episode commentary by Kevin James and the show's creator, Executive Producer Michael Weithorn. This DVD set also has a feature in which  the cast of the series takes the viewer behind the scenes, as they look back on and reminisce about the show's first season. All in all, this is a value priced DVD with crisp, clear  visuals and audio. It is absolutely one of my favorite comedies, and I am happy to have the entire first season.  I look forward to getting the succeeding seasons, as they become available.",1072483200,38,1981,4.705202312138728

I just hope they won't make us wait too long for the other seasons.",1070496000,6,108,3.739130434782609
1919901,5,B0000CGNEC,"Here in the UK we get The King Of Queens on one of the subscription channels, therefore it's potential audience is a fraction of what it could be. And for that reason it was by complete accident that I happend to stumble across it about 2 years ago, becoming hooked on it within weeks.
Enough people have given reviews of the show itself, so I wanna concerntrate on the discs and packaging.
The packaging is wonderful. The 3 discs being housed in a glossy, solid fold-out digi-pack, which is then housed in a fairly sturdy and also glossy slip case. Open the pack out and you're treated to a stylish computer generated image of the Heffernan's neighbourhood. The inside of the pack is similarly designed and includes a poutch containing a small but sweet 4 page episode symopsis. Each of the discs has a silk screen image of one of the 3 main characters of the show.
The extras on disc 3 include an insightful commentary by series creator Michael Weithorn and THE man, Kevin James. This is especially interesting as it lifts the lid on some little known facts regarding the filming of the pilot and the casting of Jerry Stiller. We also have a half hour feature with interviews and behind the scenes shots of the show being made. Strangly the extras also include 2 bonus episodes from the next season...
Regarding the quality of the audio and visuals, I have to say that I can only compare this region 1 release with the quality of the UK PAL transmissions, and I have to say that the DVDs beat the transmissions hands down. The audio is louder and clearer and the visuals are much more colourful and sharper.
The ONLY thing I don't like about The King Of Queens season 1 is the absolutely dreadful title sequence. Thank God they dumped it and replaced it with something of much better quality!
I really hope that this collection sells well and paves the way for the other seasons to be released on DVD.
5 stars for 3 wonderful characters and an excellent TV comedy making it's debut on DVD!",1070323200,14,1991,4.533333333333333

7999466,3,B0000CGNEC,"King of Queens is one of the few shows that holds up watching it a decade later. James is comic gold and Leah Remini is the perfect counter part to his good natured buffoon antics. If that weren't enough, Jerry Stiller as Carrie's live-in father is there to add some chaos to the already hilarious mix.

It's amazing how early on the three main characters have such great chemistry, Chello Goodbye is a favorite early episode (number 3) and shows just how good these actors work together. The silent fight at the Chello concert is both brilliant and hilarious.

The episodes look very good, but I would love to see a more compact Blu Ray release of the complete series. There are some extras mostly on the last disc, but the biggest complaint with this set is that the episodes are not in the running order as they aired. It's extremely frustrating to have to look on line and figure out how to toggle back and forth between menu pages and in some cases actually have to put another disc in to watch the correct episode and then have to return to the previous disc to continue. The menu design is awful, confusing and sloppy.

5 stars for the series 2 star deduction for the horrible menu. Please release this show on Blu Ray with a smart menu design and save us all some valuable shelf space and a huge headache. 9 seasons of King of Queens takes up a lot of space on DVD.",1497657600,,1373,4.376470588235295
