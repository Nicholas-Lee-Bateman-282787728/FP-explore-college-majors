322966,5,6301290933,"Ben and me is the fun-filled story of Benjamin Franklin's friendship with a little mouse named Amos. In the 1700's, Amos the mouse set out to make his way in early America. He soon found himself at the home of Benjamin Franklin, a young, unsuccessful printer and bookbinder. Seeing an opportunity to help Ben out and find a place for himself, Amos supplies Ben with helpful ideas to improve his life and business. Together they work on Ben's paper, and Amos invents the Franklin stove and bifocals. Soon, thanks to Amos, Ben is the successful and well respected publisher of the Pennsylvania Gazette, and he is fast becoming one of the most popular men in America. But Ben and Amos have a falling out one day, when Ben's experiments with electricity prove to be hazardous to Amos's health one time too many. The two spend several years apart, until war is in the air and America is ready to separate from its mother country of England. Ben goes to Amos for help, wanting his little friend to return home with him and resume their partnership, but Amos is still bitter after all these years. Amos draws up a contract that Ben must agree to if they are to be friends again, a contact that reads remarkably similarly to our own Declaration of Independence!
  Ben and Me is a wonderful Disney Classic featurette about Ben Franklin and America's struggle for Independence. It is definitely a must watch around the 4th of July, and a must have for any fan of Ben Franklin, the American Revolution, or Disney Animation in general! I'm thrilled to have it in my video collection! Pick your copy up before it's gone!",1025827200,7,1607,4.635087719298245

7810675,5,6301290933,"Ben and Me is based on the Robert Lawson book of the same title.  This Disney cartoon portrays key events in the life of Benjamin Franklin from the perspective of Amos Mouse who is a friend of Ben Franklin.  We learn about Franklin's printing business, how he invented the Franklin stove, the invention of bifocals, experiments with electricity, flying a kite during an electrical storm, and the writing of the Declaration of Independence.  I use this video as a supplement to my lessons when I teach the Constitution; Franklin signed both the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.  At twenty-five minutes in length this video is ideal for classroom use and is an effective yet entertaining teaching tool.",1484352000,,717,5.0508474576271185

7810678,5,6301290933,"Ben and Me is a delightful tale of a wonderful relationship between a mouse and Benjamin Franklin. While this tale is fiction, it opens the door to many interesting facts about a leading character in the founding of this great nation. I love American History and grieve the lack of our history being taught in our schools. I show this every November to my kindergarten students and follow up with many great science AND history lessons...Yes, history can be fun and very interesting!  Disney needs to make this available on DVD...it's great entertainment for adults and children!",1350518400,,579,4.969072164948454
7810679,4,6301290933,"I watched this repeatedly as a small child, and I grew up to earn a Master's degree in American History! Coincidence? Probably. But maybe not!

_Ben and Me_ tells the captivating tale of a mouse who ""helps"" Benjamin Franklin as he creates some of his most famous inventions. It really does give kids a taste of history in a fun and accessible way. As for the reviewer who is wrapped around the axle about it making Franklin look incompetent...well, let's just say that I think the average six-year-old has a better grasp of reality than the reviewer gives them credit for.

I still have my original VHS recording from when I was small, but I came here looking for a DVD version to share with my kids for the 4th of July. Unfortunately, one doesn't seem to exist, so I guess we'll be borrowing a VCR from Grandma instead.",1307059200,,820,4.496644295302014

Ol' Ben Franklin hits a mental block and a warward mouse helps him invent things like the Franklin Stove, bifocals, ec. Without realizing it, they are finding out about some of Ben' inventions",1299024000,,340,4.879310344827586
