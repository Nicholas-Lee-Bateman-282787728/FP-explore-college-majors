8121549,5,B000FEPRIQ,I agree with the review above - typical 80s flick. Adam plays this role great and it's fantastic to see him so young. I'm used to Jayne and Casey... but diggin' Animal Mother and now Jeff (Adam's character in this flick). The movie brought back some serious 80s flick nostalgia too... thoroughly enjoyed it!,1314230400,3,307,4.703703703703703
8121550,5,B000FEPRIQ,"This is movie is a classic example of movies from the 80s.  It has great music, cheesy dialogue and suspenseful action.  Not to mention that it has a 23 year old Adam Baldwin starring in it!  He is a great actor and this role is no exception.  You can see how much his character, Jeff, loves his girlfriend.  It's enough to make any girl swoon.  Not to mention his protective side.  Wonderful movie.  I enjoyed every second.",1227830400,4,424,4.415584415584416
