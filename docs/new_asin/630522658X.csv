995222,4,630522658X,"A young Danielle Darrieux cuts a fascinating woman in this film. She is nothing but a social climber or an ambitious woman who wants to marry a rich man. She builds up the intrigue very well, but she uses her charms, and her womanly reactions, like anger, sadness, naivete, tears, etc, with both will power and humor. She takes a man, not the first catch but the second catch, in her trap in no time. She is even in a way forced to marry this second catch by his own decision. Of course the plot has no depth but it shows too well the secondary position of women for these rich businessmen. Women are nothing but domestic facilities according to Shaw's term, but they are able to turn their dependence into some kind of tremendous power, especially since, in this good society, a man without a woman, or better a wife, is nothing, is a grotesque oddity. What's more Danielle Darrieux is a marvellous actress in this part.

995223,5,630522658X,"Douglas Fairbanks Jr. excelled in drawing room comedy, and the fast-paced script and rapid pacing by director Henry Koster along with spirited cooperation from beautiful Parisian costar Danielle Darrieux, who vibrates with him in comedic timing, make this 1938 Universal production a gem.
Darrieux is moved into a plush suite of a prominent New York hotel apartment when head waiter Mischa Auer and Darrieux's friend Helen Broderick conspire to marry the lovely Parisian to a wealthy man. Louis Hayward, who ostensibly owns ""half of Canada"" is the selected choice, but ends up ultimately vying for her with ""best friend"" Fairbanks. The dramatic conflict stems from the fact that Fairbanks catches on to Darrieux's ploy and is initially out to foil her to help his friend, but ultimately succumbs to her charms.
The script conveys the flavor of the Depression thirties and the burgeoning contrasts between rich and poor.  A shrewd Broderick realizes that Darrieux can convert her beauty into economic success by using just the right strategy on the properly situated man.  Ironically, Darrieux finally learns that, for all the money Hayward has, Fairbanks is wealthier.",1011052800,5,1168,5.274193548387097

I've always been a huge fan of the screwball comedies from the '30s and '40s, and this is truly a forgotten gem that should be given more attention.

As with most of the oldies I was not 100% happy with the audio although Alpha has at least done some work on the restoration.  The video is not spotless but is still quite watchable.  There are no subtitles and I felt that Alpha would have been better adding subtitles instead of a catalogue for more Alpha releases. The price at $7.99 is not a rip off however $6.00 would be closer to what I consider it is worth considering the lack of subtitles and extras.

All up an OK release that I give 3 stars.",1368662400,,732,5.230769230769231

One can only hope!), sound also acceptable clear (again, maybe we'll get a better quality). No extras, No subtitles. Of course, the actors have a good spelling so it's easy to understand, but still I would have liked some english subt.
If you like this movie, it's a good version and you should buy it. If not, maybe it's worth trying to watch some previews first.",1361404800,,457,4.585365853658536
995421,5,630522658X,"A charming black and white film...love Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.  I have had a hard time finding it in the past.  Very happy to finally have the DVD.",1358121600,,146,4.37037037037037
995422,3,630522658X,"This kind of situation comedy is not really to my taste unless it is done extremely well, like ""Bringing Up Baby"", ""My Man Godfrey"", or ""The Twentieth Century"".  I felt this was, on the whole, very mediocre (dumb plot, average dialog, decent acting, brisk pace) but the two people I watched it with enjoyed it more than I did, so I gave it three stars.

The quality of the print is much better than the usual Alpha Video source material - which means that it is decent instead of poor.  It is a bit faded and low-contrast, but seemed to be completely lacking the usual scratches, breaks, dust, reel-change marks, etc.  It won't knock your socks off, but it can be watched painlessly.

Danielle Darrieux and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. were all right, especially Fairbanks, but if you are a fan of 1930's comedy, they remind you why people like Cary Grant, Katharine Hepburn, and Carole Lombard were the big stars.  Their roles were too plot-driven to give them characters of any depth or sympathy to play.  For example, to escape an officious butler at one point, Darrieux distracts him with some magic tricks.  This ability of hers was never remarked on before or after - it was just there when she needed it, and vanished when she didn't.

Helen Broderick was a welcome presence in her usual role as ""older friend of the star"" but was not given much comedy to work with.  Mischa Auer, young and trim, was given a one-note character but did the best he could with it - he had one of the few genuinely funny lines in the script. (BTW, the man on the DVD cover who looks like William Powell is actually Auer.)  Louis Hayward, as the second male lead, was OK in a very generic way.  I had no idea who he was, but he reminded me of a whole lot of other people.  He was plausible as a rival to Fairbanks, and his character was actually much nicer to Darrieux, making her ultimate choice seem simply convention-driven.

All in all, if you like this kind of thing, then this is the kind of thing you'll like.  And for once, it's an Alpha Video that looks decent.",1339977600,,2050,4.44385026737968
995423,5,630522658X,"I love this movie.  It's the kind of movie that I watch over and over, especially when I need to get away from the ugly side of reality.  It's sweet and innocently funny.",1297123200,3,170,4.121212121212121
995424,3,630522658X,"This movie is one of young lady seeking a rich husband with the aid of two people.
I'm not much on movies that have magic in them otherwise this would be a good movie.  Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. performace is great.  I especially enjoyed the actress Helen Broderick, I'm hoping they will release more dvds with her in them.",1283212800,,320,4.5
995425,5,630522658X,There is not one single thing about this movie that disappoints.  It is refreshing and truly funny.  Danielle Darriuex defines enchanting and Douglas Fairbanks still makes my heart skip a beat.  Everyone who loves classic comedy should own this movie!,1256083200,3,251,5.225
995479,3,630522658X,"Nicole (Danielle Darrieux) can't seem to find a job and therefore can't pay her rent. She is beautiful, so she visits a modelling agency for a job, but they tell her she cannot be employed there unless she is signed with the agency. She lies and says she is. Next, she needs an appointment with the manager. She lies again. Now she is told about a job which requires she wear drapes for her wardrobe-- and nothing else. She refuses at first, but in desperation sneaks to the address and promptly begins to undress. The man there (Douglas Fairbanks Jr.) is confused by her behavior, but amused, and Nicole manages to wholly embarass herself.

At home, she finds herself locked out of her room for non-payment of the rent. A kindly neighbor (Helen Broderick) pays it for her, and helps cook up a scheme to hook a rich husband. The two enlist the help of an admirer to provide them with the luxuries of wealth and a conveniently placed hotel room. Now for the rich victim.

This is a fun programmer with a talented but lesser-known cast. Darrieux is lovely and entertainingly funny; her facial expressions are reminiscent of Marlene Dietrich's in comedy. Her accent serves her well and provides a few laughs. Fairbanks is wonderful as always, smooth and amusing. He is an underrated comedian and his suaveness is probably to blame for it. Flanked by Mischa Auer and Broderick, the two stars lead the story through its paces nicely.

There is nothing particularly unique about the story; it is very predictable. However, fans of screwball comedy and other styles of this era will find no faults. The casual movie-goer will be underwhelmed.",1241568000,4,1635,4.75

Douglas Fairbanks Jr., is at his handsomest and most debonair as he tries to save his friend Louis Hayward from the Parisian golddigger masquerading as a French noblewoman as charmingly played by Danielle Darriuex.

995484,5,630522658X,"The above is the famous ad tag for Danielle Darrieux's American debut, noting her enormous popularity in her native France. They were right. THE RAGE OF PARIS is one of the greatest romantic comedy ""screwball"" films Hollywood made during the 1930's yet is surprisingly little known, probably because fans of the classic romantic comedies tend to stick to the queens of the genre (Colbert, Lombard, Arthur, Loy, etc.) and most of the actresses who made only one romantic comedy are pretty bad at it (ie: Crawford). Danielle Darrieux, on the other hand, is divine! The great French star came to America with much fan-fare to make this movie and went back home to France within months being homesick. It certainly was the American's screen loss because Mme. Darrieux certainly proves she could have been a major rival for Claudette Colbert's throne as the queen of romantic comedies. Danielle is every bit as enchanting here as that other French coquette and unlike Ms. Colbert she does not go for an Americanized personality, retaining a thoroughly French sensibility. Nobody can touch Claudette in this genre as far as I am concerned, but Danielle shows she might have come close. She certainly settled with a very nice consolation prize going back home and becoming the greatest female star in the history of French cinema and still active on the screen today (2002's EIGHT WOMEN) some seventy years after her screen debut!",1143417600,21,1423,4.983193277310924

Fine performances from a uniformly-strong cast including 30s screwball stalwarts Mischa Auer and Helen Broderick; and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as the love interest for Darrieux.
