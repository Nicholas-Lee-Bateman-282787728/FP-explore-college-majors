535308,5,6303038913,"The Image dvd release, with the cover that shows Cesar Romero, Hugh Beaumont and the triceratops, against a green background, DOES have the moving Sid Melton scene at the end. I had a vhs copy that cut it, so I ordered this Image dvd release, when it became available, and the scene IS included.

As for the movie, it's an excellent B movie with snappy clever dialogue and dinosaurs that look more cute than menacing. It was a perennioal favorite of mine as a youth and remains so. It's not King Kong but it's very enjoyable.",1147824000,51,525,4.46875
535309,2,6303038913,"OK, from the other reviews I have concluded that this is still a cut-up version.  Sid Melton's ""death scene"" is missing (Romero puts a cig between his blood-oozing lips before he cashs his chips in and tells them to say goodby to the plane for him).  Some of the earthquake scenes are probably missing also (Acquanetta's demise - if my memory serves me correct they used the ""lava flow overcomes cavegirl"" stock footage from 1 Million Years BC - Now you think, ""Say, what did happen to those other villagers?"").  Sinister Cinema advised me some years ago that whoever owns the rights was just too lazy or stupid to restore them properly.  Boycott it until they do it right.  Pitiful! It was one of my favorites as a child.",1125532800,8,722,4.565891472868217
535310,5,6303038913,"I just got my Lost Continent DVD today from Amazon. I saw this movie in a theater when I was young. It was good to see it again after some 50-years for the first time in a long time.
I had my concerns, by other reviews about the scene with Sid Melton being gored by the Triceratop would be cut out from the DVD version.
Well! the scene is in! The DVD shows Sid Melton behind a rock and a Triceratop coming in from behind him. The others tried to warn him, but too late. He gets gored.
The entire movie is as I remember seeing it back then, especially the tinted green scenery. I remember my brother coming home telling me about it which prompted me to go see the movie.
An interesting item that is inside the DVD case is the information sheet that gives a detailed account of how the movie was made, Sid Melton's role, and some disappointments that faced the directors and actors.
The stop-motion dinosaur sequence were not the best, it explains, but they didn't have the technology like they have now.
The movie was done in 11-days.
But they got a lot of praise for their efforts in making this movie when it was released in theaters.
Enjoy!",1124409600,14,1142,4.316279069767442
535311,4,6303038913,I saw this film only when it was shown on B&W TV in the '50s and didn't know about the green tint gimmic until I watched the DVD.,1121299200,,129,3.642857142857143
535312,4,6303038913,"Not the greatest Sid Melton science fiction movie (that would be The Atomic Submarine), Lost Continent is still lots of cheesy fun, one of those ""cross-genre"" flicks that should appeal to pretty much any B-movie fan. You get SF, war movie, and jungle adventure cliches neatly combined with some of the most pitiful stop-motion dinosaurs ever. The quintessential B-cast includes Cesar Romero (TV's Joker, Week-end in Havana, Captain from Castile), John Hoyt (When Worlds Collide, Attack of the Puppet People), Whit Bissell (Teenage Werewolf & Frankenstein, Time Tunnel), Hugh Beaumont (Ward Cleaver, Michael Shayne), Chick Chandler (Music Man, Blondie), and Sid Melton (Make Room for Daddy, Green Acres), with Acquanetta (Captive Wild Woman, Tarzan & the Leopard Woman) and second-billed Hillary Brooke (Ministry of Fear, Invaders from Mars) in cameos. To the movie's credit, the plot moves at a brisk pace (except during the seemingly interminable 'climbing scenes'), Romero and Chandler execute some great flyboy banter, and the earthquake stock footage from One Million B.C. is actually pretty well integrated into the movie, particularly during the surprisingly exciting (if rather implausible) climax. The script by Richard Landau (Girl in Black Stockings, TV's Wild Wild West) and direction by veteran PRC schlockmeister Sam Newfield (Nabonga, White Pongo, Flying Serpent) are also slightly above-average for this type of thing. Unfortunately, when we eventually encounter the extremely lame stop-motion brontosaurus, pterodactyl, and triceratops (and one live lizard for laughs), any semblance of credibility generated up to that point is completely destroyed, leaving the movie dangling on the edge of ""so-bad-it's-good"" rather than ""really-not-half-bad"". Still a great Saturday-afternoon time-waster for the low-budget cinema set. Serious stop-motion fans beware.
Image upgrades their typical DVD package a bit with this release (perhaps feeling the heat from Anchor Bay?). The disc comes in the superior 'keep case' box and the main menu is animated (not that I really care that much). Twelve chapter stops, five trailers in an Easter egg, and a very good-to-excellent if rather scratchy LC trailer are the usual extras, plus you get informative Tom Weaver liner notes, and an isolated music and effects track so you can listen to Paul Dunlap's rousing score minus the wisecracks. Source print quality is generally excellent with terrific grayscale, brightness, contrast, sharpness, and detail. There is some light speckling and blemishing (some sporadic horizontal 'banding' toward the beginning of the movie), but otherwise there is no major damage. The plateau scenes are tinted green as in the original release. While I commend Image for presenting the movie in its original format, these scenes are not as easy on the eyes as the crisp B&W of the rest of the movie. The only sour note in the whole shebang is the extremely hyperbolic commentary (""beautifully crafted,"" ""excellent production values"") by Wade Williams on the box. Pity the fool who purchases based on his glowing review. Overall a step up from Image's usual offerings and as close to a definitive release as this film is likely to see. Three stars for the movie, 4 or 5 for the DVD. Cheese-lovers, go for it.",1011657600,54,3287,5.396887159533074
535313,3,6303038913,"Surprised to see a stop motion Pterodactyl in this one.  Great scenes of attacking dinosaurs killed violently by bloodletting gunfire.  I found the story to be boring but the dinosaur scenes were green tinted, exciting and also greatly scored.  Not sure who did the music but it was first rate!! Better than 'Unknown Island' but I still prefer 'The Land Unknown' or 'The Land That Time Forgot'  for a good, cheap dino-adventure. Gee Wally, that Eddie is such a creep...",983491200,,469,4.825
535314,3,6303038913,"This is a typical 50's atomic era adventure/sci-fi film. Ceasar Romero leads a military expedition toa ridiculously high mountaintop to find a lost rocket. And I do mean RIDICULOUSLY high. About 1/3 of this movie is  footage of them climbing the mountain. Atop the escartment, they find a  green-tinted world inhabited by play-doh dinosaurs. One of the few  dinomovies not to have a predatory dinosaur. An entertaining movie  nonetheless.",956016000,,438,5.304347826086956
535315,3,6303038913,"Primitive but effective sci-fi/dinosaur movie.  An experimental rocket (as if in 1951 it could be any other kind) gets lost somewhere over the ocean, and the military hones in on a remote island.  Major Joe Nolan (Cesar  Romero) is ordered to guide a search party of scientist types to retrieve  the critical scientific data in the missing rocket.  The simple, fast paced  story holds the viewers' attention.  There are a few tiresome interludes  while Nolan argues with Rostov (John Hoyt) to get on the ""right""  political side.  Evidently in 1951 it was smart for moviemakers to be  openly anti-communist.  The expedition finds the rocket on a great plateau  of a tropical island.  A primitive jungle covers the plateau, tinted in  green (an unusual visual gimmick in a B&W film), and inhabited by  antisocial, stop motion animated dinosaurs.  This Grade B movie is fun for  11 year olds of all ages.  The anti-communist moralizing of the script  makes the film a curious relic of a bygone era.  Lovable Sid Melton's  comedy relief provides chuckles in distress.  Until the triceratops  attacks, but we won't go there in this review.  Cesar Romero is curiously  cast as a career military type.  Hugh Beaumont (you know, Wally and the  Beaver's dad) is one of the scientists.  The special effects are almost as  primitive as the dinosaurs, but serve the purpose.  Bottom line, this is a  basic sci-fi/dinosaur adventure film that doesn't pretend to be more than  it is.  Take it for what it's worth, and enjoy it.",950745600,31,1513,4.873015873015873
535316,3,6303038913,"I grew up during the formative years of SciFi and all the mellodramatic garbage that we were forced to digest, but this and ""Rocketship XM"" were the best of the growing medium.  As a ""pre-Boomer""  we didn't have an awful lot to see on Saturday afternoons, and many of the  movies we COULD see were denied us by the Catholic Legion of Decency.  So,  many of us were destined to grow our teeth on second rate genre movies.  In  1950 and 1951 these two movies kept me awake many nights thinking about  monsters and the post-atomic age we were going to live in -- a lot of meat  to digest for a boy of 7 and 8 years of age.  ""The Lost  Continent"" is a clasic for me, because it helped me form a wedge in my  thinking about the abstract world of science fiction.  I respect the effort  that this low-budget movie achieved, and the results are terrific for the  $.29 that were spent on special effects.  Besides, this is one of the few  films where we '50s children had a glimpse of a Beaverless pre-Ward Cleaver  in the accomplished actor Hugh Beaumont.  It's worth the price of the CD  just to see him act without Wally and The Beav.  I always will like this  film -- as much of my childhood as Wonder Bread and Richard Nixon.",938736000,7,1222,4.244541484716157

It will best be enjoyed by die hard fans of this sort of diversion. It does contain a slew of more than competent character actors (Cesar Romero, John Hoyt, Whit Bissell, Hugh Beaumont and Sid Melton especially) that make the movie appealing in a way that lesser actors would have failed to accomplish. The story concerns a team of scientists and military personnel searching  an uncharted Pacific isle for a wayward missle which contains sensitive and classified material. I won't make the obligatory but pointless comments about the movie's special effects as compared to those of today. The technology nor money simply was not available at the time.

I gotta say this is a rather decent 1951 Sci-fi fantasy adventure flick with a decent cast but poorly executed.

535624,3,6303038913,"All about a rocketship that crashes on a remote island and the guys sent out to find the craft and retrieve its 'black box' and other vital secrets. The boys fly to the last reported location of the craft but encounter engine trouble and have to crash on an island. The island just happens to be the same place where the rocket came down---nice coincidence. The pilot, played by veteran actor Cesar Romero, decides to crashland on the rocky island rather than the predominant smooth ocean waters---nice thinking, Cez. The barrelling plane comes down in a jungle with windows and fuselage intact---the guys come out looking as if they just had their nails clipped. No Ginger or Maryann on this isle, though, as they come upon a jungle girl and a chubby little kid. The kid has a conventional 50-ish American haircut---must have some pretty good barbers on the island. The jungle girl points the way to where the rocket probably landed---a dangerous mountain plateau avoided by the natives. The guys start up the rocky monolith using a novel strategy to prevent altitude sickness---by smoking a cigarette at every break. Actor Whit Bissell, with one of the most recognizable faces of the baby-boomer TV era, falls from a cliff into the foggy depths and we never see him again---but you know that he gets up and dusts himself off as he went on to omnipresence in a slew of later 50's and 60's horror/science fiction/Western films and TV shows. There is one scene where the guys have to jump over a bottomless break in the rocky path in order to get to the other side and continue their ascent. It's a tough go but they make it---hey, guys, how about taking off those heavy backpacks and tools and tossing them across first before jumping? The ascent and arrival at the top is filled with lots of the compulsory 50's B-like traisping around and muttering. Once on the plateau the film is tinted green---was hoping we'd bump into Marta or Athena here (the knockout green aliens in the original STAR TREK episode 'Whom God's Destroy' [1969] and the LOST IN SPACE TV series episode 'The Girl from the Green Dimension' [1967], respectively), but, no such luck. Romero, a very fine actor, performs splendidly under the circumstances with noir-worthy delivery and presence. At one point he suspects two of the scientists he has brought along---one played by John Hoyt (can't forget him as the selfish, wheelchair-bound millionaire in WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE, 1951) and the other by Hugh Beaumont (yep, the Beav's dad)---of collusion, planning the mishap with the rocket so that they could claim the uranium-rich but geologically volatile plateau. Romero is wrong but this would have been a much more interesting and novel plot to pursue in this film. Once on the top we see dinosaurs that appear more like toys or models than any of O'brien's or Harryhausen's work---pretty bad. One guy, Ward Cleaver (I mean, the Beav's dad) is chased by a bronto and has to climb up a tree (a scenario first depicted in the original KING KONG [1933])---nice strategy of climbing up a tree when chased by a bronto, facilitating the ravenous fury of a beast who happens to have a neck as long as the tree your climbing. You would think that after what happened to the guy in KING KONG this guy would have learned his lesson. The plateau is huge and the rocket could be anywhere, as there are no clues as to its whereabouts---nice how they just stumble into it [""...hey, there it is..""] The ship crashed nose-first into a swamp-like area---interesting how it sank to a perfect depth leaving the only external door at a level above ground just about the height of the average adult male, easily accessible to anyone except a midget. When first discovered the ship is at an angle to the ground but later seems to have miraculously straightened itself out a bit. At the end, as the mountain begins to implode and the boys scamper back down, a small boulder hits Romero on the shoulder without eliciting even a wince, an ouch, or interrupting his descent. The movie ends with Romero, sitting in a canoe, lighting up another cig---guess he'd rather go from a heart attack than starve to death or become a shark's next meal. If you look closely he seems to have stopped for a shave during his descent. By the way, the DVD's cover art features a guy to Romero's left who is never part of the original investigative party, is never on the plane, yet shows up for a few seconds as the first brontosaurous approaches---an editing miscue? A fill-in for Beaumont who was busy combing his hair? Who was this guy?  Just gotta love this. No extras on the DVD but a very good print as usual from IMAGE. Have fun.",1288483200,,4664,4.694749694749695
535625,1,6303038913,"Despite the cast, this film is disappointing. Normally, I like these scifi pictures and rarely find one I don't care for. I've found this one. The acting is uninspired, the monsters look as phoney as they are, and the sets are contrived and unconvincing.

535626,5,6303038913,I FELL FOR THIS MOVIE FROM THE DAY IT CAME OUT..JUST AN ALL AROUND GREAT FILM.,1265328000,,78,3.9375
535627,4,6303038913,"1951 had its share of great films-The Thing (From Another World), The Day the Earth Stood Still, The African Queen, An American in Paris, A Streetcar Named Desire, When Worlds Collide, etc.  Lost Continent is a nice entry into the science fiction genre.

Hunting for a lost atomic rocket on a remote island are three scientists, two air force pilots and a sergeant whose plane crashes on the mysterious island with its plateau shrouded in clouds.  Instruments failure was the cause of the crash.

They meet a youngster and a young woman- Acquanetta, an exotic beauty who appeared in a number of B movies.  Nicknamed the Venezuelan Volcano by the studio who wanted to add a Latin favor, she was actually a Native American born in Wyoming. Unfortunately, for her fans her appearance was just a cameo. She directs them to the mountain of the gods and the great firebird that caused her people to abandon their island.

Now, the scientists and the sergeant are totally dressed for a climb up this island's Olympus, but the two pilots are dressed in their uniforms and dress shoes.  Take it from someone who has climbed a lot of mountains and canyon walls, dress shoes don't cut it.  You need a great pair of boots and the right gear.

It was nice to see Cesar Romero in his prime.  His main love interest was the beautiful Hillary Brooke who was regulated to a mere cameo. He would gain international fame in the late 60's as the Joker on the Batman television series.

Whit Bissell as Stanley Briggs was the family man with two children. He had no business climbing a mountain.  In the late 60's he would gain international recognition as the commanding general in the television series-The Time Tunnel.

John Hoyt is always a joy to watch in films.  In fact, he was in three 1951 films-this one, When Worlds Collide, and Quebec. Playing an exile Russian scientist was a great part for this fine actor, especially when he revealed the reasons why he left the Soviet Union which is one of the touching moments in this film.  In addition, he had the best line, ""No country can survive when it loses the respect of its own people or the world"".

Hugh Beaumont, one of the scientists, was one of the busiest actors of his day. However, it is his portrayal of Ward Cleaver of Leave It To Beaver fame that he is remembered fondly as a great dad and role model.  He wrote and directed several episodes of the series, especially the finale.

One of the special effects was the green tint when the party reached the top of the plateau.  It was explained why there was green tint.

One thing that amazed me was the endless supply of cigarettes.  Based on all the smoking in this film, it is a miracle that the prehistoric creatures did not die just from second hand smoke.

Overall, this is a great film which has an excellent story, cast and descent special effects for 1951.  Paul Dunlap wrote the music.  His name is probably unfamiliar to most people, but his resume is outstanding if you want to look it up.",1247184000,3,2999,4.552238805970149
535628,2,6303038913,"Brave men climb a volcano. Brave men shoot some exotic fauna. Brave men recover missing object and climb down volcano. Island holding volcano then explodes. The end.

That's pretty much the whole movie. Of course, it's possible to strip any movie down to a handful of essential plot points like that; the problem is, this movie comes pre-stripped, as it were. There really is nothing else to this film. That, and a little unnecessary filler involving some severity dated attitudes on dating, a tad of moralizing about communism and a couple of dashes of pseudoscience, and you have a relatively dull hour, lost forever. Unless you really, really like war-buddy movies, it's hard to recommend this one for anything.

It probably played better when communism was a hot topic.",1246579200,,773,4.984496124031008
535699,2,6303038913,"In the early to mid 1960s, LOST CONTINENT enjoyed a place of prominence on NYC's WNEW-TV 5. The station often ran this cheap-o monster movie on early Sunday afternoons. I can recall seeing it at least four times in those years.

What home viewers who hadn't caught this film in first run weren't aware of back then, is that the entire section where the spaceship-seeking expedition is atop a heavily jungled mountain plateau was green-tinted (because of all the chlorophyll in the air, you see). WNEW's telecast of the picture was in pristine b&w.

This IMAGE ENTERTAINMENT edition restores that green tint. They also offer as an extra a very scratched-up and break-repaired print of LOST CONTINENT's theatrical trailer, plus the usual chapter stops. There's no subtitle option.
.

As a fond childhood memory and taken from that perspective, LC still works for me, but in the cold light of adult reality, I must admit that despite a talented cast, it's a real stinker. The weakest element is a crucial one: its stop-action dinosaurs. As an occasional shutterbug, I got better results with an 8mm home movie camera than you see here. It's as if they didn't have the time or patience to take the number of individual frames necessary to imbue their clay dinos with any semblance of lifelike movement. The most laughable animated moment occurs after little Sid Melton is attacked by a triceratops. The thing faces stage left and smoothly rolls off as if it's standing on a cart.

Other special effects are equally amateur. An earthquake that tears the island asunder looks fake fake fake! It's doubtful that today's gradeschoolers wouldn't notice how bad these scenes are.

Some family-type movies, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-WIZARD-OF-OZ/dp/B00388PK1U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE WIZARD OF OZ</a>&nbsp;1939), you can revisit 40-plus years later and still find them magical. Others, like this Sam Newfield misstep, you rewatch and wonder did this picture really amuse me as a child? Just another reminder of why you're not able to go home again, I guess.

535701,3,6303038913,"When you think of a ""B"" science fiction movie, one like THE LOST CONTINENT comes to mind.  Released in 1951, it is a microcosm of the age. It shows the skimpy special effects typical of the age although one might think that Hollywood ought to have progressed beyond the King Kong film of nearly twenty years prior.  It includes the prototypical cast of second tier actors, most of whom are well known to viewers old enough to remember such stalwarts as ABBOT AND COSTELLO (Hillary Brooke), ATTACK OF THE PUPPET PEOPLE (John Hoyt), I WAS A TEENAGE WEREWOLF (Whit Bissel), LEAVE IT TO BEAVER (Hugh Beaumont), ROCKY JONES, SPACE RANGER (Sid Melton), and BATMAN (Cesar Romero).  And it even includes the anti-communist dogma then current with a burgeoning cold war.

The plot is a straight forward account of a team of scientists and military types sent to recover a lost missle.  The film never lets the viewer forget that the successful accomplishment of the mission is a must. Even when the very lives of the team are in danger, their leader (an oddly miscast Cesar Romero as the romantic hero) insists that they push on. And push on they do.  Director Sam Newfield spends considerable screen time in showing no more than the extreme vicissitudes involved in climbing the sheer cliffs of a volcano that you know must erupt as part of the grand finale.  The dinosaurs are clumsily filmed in a manner that had begun to pall even on juvenile audiences. It is easy to overlook the scientific blunders such as a charging Brontosaurus, who as a herbivore, would not have been likely to feel threatened by a pack of puny humans. What gives THE LOST CONTINENT its basic dramatic thrust is the continuing ability of the rescue team to recover the lost missle so as to determine why it went off course.  There were a few grumbles in the team about whether the benefit was worth the cost but Cesar Romero kept them on target.  There were even a few scenes of emotional power such as the one in which the wise cracking Sid Melton was gored by a raging Triceratops.  The ending weakened what until then had been a reasonably satisfying adventure movie.  I shall not reveal the specifics except to say that the crumbling island vignette had been done before and better.  Still, THE LOST CONTINENT is a pleasant way for the over fifty crowd to remember just why they went to the Saturday matinee in the first place.",1246147200,,2399,4.6453900709219855

535704,5,6303038913,"My favorite sci-fi movie, in fact my FAVORITE MOVIE.  Why?  It had a limited budget but with special effects including stop-motion animation and a ""cheesy"" theme.  An atom-powered rocket...stock footage of a V-2 rocket taking off from White Sands in the early fifties...a 1941-vintage battleship (Arizona Class) with two main masts as a research vessel in the Pacific code-named ""Neptune"".  ""Top of the World"" was a radar unit inside a mobile vehicle.  Then why is it so good a movie?

It is pure escapism.  The movie's musical score is riveting.  The special effects, though limited,  are state-of-the-art for 1951.  There are no ""gila monsters"" substituting for dinosaurs except for one scene near the top of the ""lost continent"" about 25 minutes into the movie.  The Brontosaurus and Triceratops look decent for what was thought of as their appearance in the fifties.

Cesar Romero (the Joker in 1966-1967 ""Batman"" as well as numerous thirties-forties movies), Chick Chandler, Hugh Beaumont (Beaver's father), John Hoyt (""When Worlds Collide"", ""Time Travelers"" in 1964, ""X-The Man With X-Ray Eyes"" and Twilight Zone episodes), Hugh Bissell (1956 ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"") and Sid Melton (""Danny Thomas Show"" and ""Atomic Submarine"") provide credible acting to the movie.

Why Hillary Brooke and Aquanetta were given higher credit is a mystery to me than some of these actors mentioned, above.  Nonetheless, this movie is the ONE movie I have seen 100+ times and never get tired of watching.

Unfortunately the DVD master has ""light bars"" through some of the sequences but that does not deter from my memories of making this the greatest movie of my life.

Yet to be realistic, satellites most likely have scanned every spot on the globe and it is likely that some cigar/candy wrapper litter-bug has visited each and every lonely spot.

The acting is quite good and the trek through the lost continent is superb as far as I am concerned. Never mind that the dinosaurs seems wooden and in fact there is one scene that the triceratops looks like some one has made a cardboard model and moved it through the scene. And why do these dinosaurs, Triceratops and Brontosaurus, both of which are primarily vegetarians in nature, attack people on sight? Yet who cares. The story is great, the location is super, and this is a movie well worth having on the self to see now and then.

I would have given this 5 stars if the dinosaurs were a little more true to form and, actually, they are not all that bad, to be honest.
