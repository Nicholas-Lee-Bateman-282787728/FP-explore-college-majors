I can highly recommend the film to everyone who already enjoyed the book. You will see the equipment of Robert Gendler and many others, watch Timothy Ferris' spectacular home observatory ...",1221436800,,345,4.766666666666667
2922145,5,B000UJBY8S,"This DVD makes a great companion to the book ""Seeing in the Dark"" by Timothy Ferris. After viewing several times, I felt compelled to purchase a telescope. The saying ""enthusiasm is contagious"" is true here. Ferris loves his work, and if you have any interest in astronomy, I predict you will love this, too. I wished it were an hour longer, but perhaps like any great entertainment, the key is to ""always leave the audience wanting more."" With it's beautiful photography and terrific narration by the author, Seeing in the Dark is a must have for any astronomy buff.",1200182400,4,567,4.737373737373737

2922147,5,B000UJBY8S,"The photography, the music and the story are really, really good and it provides a good introduction to amateur astronomy. I highly recommend it. I have to be fair, though, and disclose that I am in it!",1191283200,4,202,4.486486486486487
2922148,5,B000UJBY8S,"We have watched this DVD twice now and believe it to be one of Timothy Ferris's finest. It imparts the excitement of astronomy and has been exceptionally well produced. We will watch it again, and share it with our friends. Well done!

2922149,5,B000UJBY8S,"Magical and haunting, ""Seeing in the Dark"" is a beautifully photographed and inspirational account of the significant impact of amateurs in the field of astronomy.  Even if you know little about the stars, you'll be enchanted by the imagery and engaged by the age-old question of man's place in the universe.  This production should be the starting point of many interesting discussions, in and out of the classroom.  Highly recommended, especially in HD.",1190937600,20,455,5.205479452054795
2922150,5,B000UJBY8S,"As a top-end production, this show is indeed top-notch.  Its narrative approach is very informative, and its content spans information on both the vast array of objects in the area of astronomy and the tools that amateur astronomers can use.  The special effects are dramatic - one of my favorites being the M42 ""fly-by"".

In the technical arena, it does simplify some of the hobby's difficulties and complexities.  For potential amateur astronomers interested mainly in visual use, this approach is less of an impact than to those perhaps wanting to get into astrophotography.  Setup and good visual results can easily be obtained in under an hour of setup time.  Astrophotography, on the other hand, takes a little more time both to set up and to generate an outstanding image.  Duration is measured in hours to get high quality shots.

Those interested in getting into astronomy should indeed go to a few ""star parties"", of which there are many at this time of year (fall).  At one of these, you can check out the different types of scopes and see for yourself the strengths/weaknesses, and budgetary limitations for each.

In short, this is a high-quality review of various aspects of amateur astronomy, both instructive and entertaining.",1190937600,8,1242,5.014634146341463
2922151,3,B000UJBY8S,"Based solely on content and quality, this is a five-star product. But I'm an amateur astronomer, and this DVD sets a 'trap' that I'm afraid some are going to fall into.

Specifically: You'll see someone looking into a moderately-sized telescope, and the next thing you see is full color, detailed view of some nebula or galaxy or whatever, and I'm here to tell you, this just ain't the way it works. This misleading information turns this 5-star production into a 3-star one (in my opinion), and the sad fact is, there was no need for it.

If you like what you see on this DVD, your next step is NOT to go out and buy a telescope. Go to a star party, and check out a variety of telescopes and what you can see through them.",1190246400,60,723,4.3088235294117645
2922152,5,B000UJBY8S,"I went to a special preview screening of the show in Denver.  They interviewed some very interesting people to show how they are involved in amateur astronomy.  The images and videos are absolutely beautiful.  I liked the way they slowly zoomed in on some of the still photos -- it felt as if I was truly traveling through space.  If you have a High-def TV, you need to watch it in the HD widescreen format.  Very inspiring and highly recommended.",1189728000,5,447,4.5375

8213469,5,B000UJBY8S,"This film aired on PBS seven years ago.  It is a wonderful look at amateur astronomy in its many forms, told by Timothy Ferris, an English professor, writer, and well-known amateur astronomer.  Ferris does a fabulous job exploring the worlds of telescope making, star parties, comet hunters, and people of all walks of life who are fascinated (and often obsessed) with exploring the night sky.  I own the DVD, Blu-Ray, audio book, and the original book.  But I am not obsessed.  :-)

The Blu-Ray version looks better overall than the DVD, though some scenes do not look better to my eye.  There is a great commentary track by Ferris on both the DVD and Blu-Ray versions (there is no extra content on the Blu-Ray) that is so complete and interesting it is almost like watching an alternate version.  The book form is much more in-depth, as you'd expect.  Ferris himself reads the audio version, and he
has the perfect relaxed voice to take you into this wonderful world.  if you have any interest in astronomy this work is for you.  i cannot recommend it enough.

Finally, when I attended the late John Dobson's 90th birthday party at the Randall Museum some years ago, I spotted Timothy Ferris.  When I approached him to tell him how much I enjoyed ""Coming of Age in the Milky Way"" and his other wonderful books, he seemed almost embarrassed  to be recognized.",1430956800,3,1360,4.6835443037974684

8213471,4,B000UJBY8S,"This is a Timothy Ferris film shown on PBS. Ferris talks about his early experiences with astronomy and because he was born on August 29, 1944, he is someone I can identify with. He is a mere 16 months older than I am.  His film focuses on amateur stargazers and their telescopes.  Ferris gets into the life of E.E. Barnard, a Nashville-born astronomer who photographed the Milky Way. It was the Horsehead Nebula which convinced Barnard that the dark regions in the Milky Way were gas and dust. Exoplanets were the rage by 2007, and Ferris talks about them and the means by which they are detected. I became aware of Ferris when I read his book, ""The Red Limit"" way back in 1980. As much as I enjoy astronomy, I realize that it takes us out of a world in which we have to function.",1401408000,,781,4.342465753424658
8213472,5,B000UJBY8S,"If you are looking for a movie that may light a spark, buy this movie.  It's great for anyone of any age who is interested or think they may be interested in watching the skies.",1368835200,,177,4.057142857142857
8213473,5,B000UJBY8S,Beautifully put together as a story with a great sound track. Anyone interested in astronomy or astrophotography must see this.,1359590400,,127,5.4
8213474,1,B000UJBY8S,"After reading Ferris' book I was anxious to see this DVD. What a disappointment! Let me count the ways:

- It's all about Timothy. See his telescope, see his observatory, see his son play guitar, hear about his childhood, see Timothy get a new telescope, etc.

- The music is terrible. Throughout they play some kind of old blues guitar which surely must be an acquired taste.

- Over and over a small telescope is shown, a person bends down to look through it, and BOOM, cut to Hubble Space Telescope images. Anyone who's not already an amateur astronomer will be horribly mislead by this. No telescope you can buy, much less an 80mm refractor, will give the views they imply you can see.

- Lastly, this mishmash of ego and Hubble shots is simply boring. It would have been fascinating to see what Herschel saw through his telescope, and then a modern one; but all we get is the Hubble output, from start to finish. Unless you've been living under a rock you've seen all these amazing Hubble shots before, but they make believe amateurs can see these things themselves.

Whoever slapped this together should be ashamed of themselves.",1356912000,5,1135,4.655
8213475,2,B000UJBY8S,"Timothy Ferris is to Astronomy as Anthony Bourdain is
to Gastronomy. You'll get a light sprinkling of information with
an over-sized helping of Ego.

Ferris, like Bourdain, is more journalist than expert; although
they both wish to feign to be peers of those they admire.

That said, the DVD is well produced, well-shot, and paced reasonably
well. For a beginner, it may entice them into the pursuit
of amateur astronomy.

There is no doubt that Ferris loves the subject and is in awe of
the Universe and our small place within it.

And for that saving grace, I forgive this largely self-indulgent
work.
