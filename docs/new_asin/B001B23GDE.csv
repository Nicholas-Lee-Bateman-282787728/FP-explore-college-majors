8281484,5,B001B23GDE,"I guess the first review did not take.  I'll do it again.  I guess I have always been a striker.  Kind of less skilled on control and this DVD looked like a needed addition.  Well thought out and nicely done.  With the point of view toward the street and a real confrontation, Sammy delivers the How To to aplly locks at the right time.  His materials have always provided value for the money I paid.  Get'um.  Train it.  And you will be better prepared for the real world.",1415318400,,473,4.284090909090909
8281485,4,B001B23GDE,This is a recommendation for those who have experienced with self defense techniques that will give them preparing for the defense skills. Those lessons are not easy but slowly learning with patience. This requires a lot of practices. Several guidelines are included.

8281487,5,B001B23GDE,"As a security professional, all of the techniques in this video are incredibly effective and useful. The production quality, teaching presentation, and of course the techniques themselves, all make this dvd an asset for me professionally and as a personal interest. These techniques, though brutal and effective for painful control and submission if done properly, are non-lethal and can be enacted in ways which leave no lasting incriminating harm to the recipient.

8281488,5,B001B23GDE,"In this DVD Franco expands your arsenal of defensive maneuvers by delving into the realm of the moderate response in the form of the wrist lock. Sometimes a passive response isn't enough and an aggressive one isn't called for or wouldn't be legally and morally justified. A moderate response where you can control the assailant and provoke submission without necessarily damaging them as you would with a punch or other blow is an essential skill which could be implemented in a
variety of situations.

Mastering the moderate response skills taught in this DVD will be of particular use to police officers and security guards who must refrain from using excessive force and who are always at risk of spurious charges of abuse. But let me make this clear: THIS DVD IS NOT ONLY FOR POLICE OFFICERS AND SECURITY GUARDS. I'm not a police officer or security guard but I appreciate this training very much because the way I live my life I believe the chances that I'll find myself in a situation where I need to respond to an assailant with an aggressive response are somewhat less than the chances I'll need to use a moderate one at least initially. I can easily see myself being encroached upon at a party or a bar. A moderate response where I attempted to de-escalate but the assailant grabbed my arm might be the better response as I could take control of the assailant without actually damaging him. If he threw a punch at me or otherwise escalated the altercation into an all-out fight I'd respond aggressively either by striking back or making further use of the wrist/shoulder lock to break or dislocate. Hopefully it wouldn't come to that especially if the assailant is a friend or family member who may have become aggressive due to intoxication. Furthermore I may call upon these skills with my little brother who suffers from Autism and sometimes becomes violent. I wouldn't want to strike him but I do need to be able to stop him from hurting me or the other members of our family and in some cases from hurting himself.

I also very much appreciate Franco's focus on always being prepared for the situation to escalate. If you attempt to perform a wrist lock the assailant may react by throwing a punch at you or pulling out a knife. The drills taught in the DVD are designed to help you perfect your technique while always being ready to defend yourself from any other attack and then segue into an aggressive response. I've already had the opportunity to practice all the techniques and drills and they are all very effective.",1214092800,7,2537,4.698876404494382
