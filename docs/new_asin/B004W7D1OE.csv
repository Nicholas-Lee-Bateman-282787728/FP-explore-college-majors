8444715,5,B004W7D1OE,I REALLY LOVED THIS MOVIE VERY MUCH. I LOVE HISTORICAL MOVIES A LOT. THIS IS A MOVIE THAT TEENS AND YOUNG ADULTS SHOULD SEE AND LEARN FROM YOUR ACTIONS.,1350518400,2,152,4.275862068965517
8444716,4,B004W7D1OE,"This is a LIFETIME film and has that made for TV feel to it. There are 2 New Year's eve parties going on. The adults are having a boring one where they play charades. The underage drinking teens across the road are rocking and having a great time. Bob, who is at the dull party, decides the teens are having too much fun and goes next door and upstairs to the bedroom where he tells them all to go downstairs. The next thing you know Bob (David Cubitt) is dead, apparently killed from doing a bad Brian Keith impersonation. His widow (Kim Raver) thought he did a pretty good Brian Keith impersonation and wants to get to the bottom of his death.

Like any ""good"" LIFETIME movie we don't get to see what actually happened, so they dangle a mystery in front of us as the teens all pinkie swear into a very obvious  BOND OF SILENCE, having their entire lives in front of them. The cops, didn't think there was foul play at first, and didn't create a crime scene. Now they must back track and try to round up 200 kids that weren't there or didn't see anything.

When the police (Greg Grunberg) can't solve the case, mom springs into action with a $10,000 reward to the dismay of the kids of Rees Harbor (a secret) High School. The film mostly concentrates on the various characters, their interactions, and motives. The incident turns the community against the victim.

The movie was actually a fairy decent drama. I thought the kids did good job acting. The film was based on a true story. Katy, Bob, and Ryan are real characters while the rest are fictional. The case took 5 years to resolve.

No f-bombs, sex, nudity. Teen drinking/drug use.",1335484800,3,1640,4.453333333333333
