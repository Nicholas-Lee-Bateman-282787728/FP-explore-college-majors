Cate Blanchett deserves all respect and honor for her heartwrenching portrayal of Elizabeth, as she struggles to take control of her life and of her country.  The atmosphere  in this film is so fitting and underlies every instant of action.  (Please  go read my review of this movie at  [...]",925430400,,332,4.839285714285714
1015724,5,6305358591,"There have been very few movies in my 45 years that I have felt carried away by.  This one grabs you from the opening moments.  My ancestry is Engish, but I have always been bored with English history until this movie.  Although this movie is not exact in it's historical content, (Walsingham  did not murder Mary Queen of Scots, etc.) It does however capture the  intrigue of the conspiracy against Elizabeth.  I found myself not knowing  who to believe or trust.  I also found myself really caring about Elizabeth  and her safety. This one is really a thriller.
Cate Blanchett should have  won the Oscar for her portrayal of Queen Bess. I can see that most everyone  here agrees.  She took my breath away. Can't wait to get my own copy.",925257600,,738,4.549618320610687
1015725,5,6305358591,"Take it for granted that this film is NOT a history lesson.  But as a lesson in how to create an icon, this film is amazing.
Beautifully shot and acted, this film is worth seeing.
Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush  are superb, Joseph Fiennes is adequate (though his performance was too  similar to his ""William Shakespeare"" for my taste).",924825600,,337,4.677966101694915
1015726,4,6305358591,"Somewhat monotonous screenplay has been saved thanks to Cate's incredibly carismatic portrayal of Elizabeth, the Virgin Queen. Other than her, Jeffrey Rush deserves acclaim. Joseph Fiennes is a bit disappointing though.. Once you start playing this video, you will be captured by the sheer charm of Cate. My opinion is.. the Oscar found a wrong owner this year..",923616000,,362,5.258620689655173

1016013,5,6305358591,"Excellent film!  When it first came out, I went to see it due to all of the constant award praise.  At the time, while I loved Cate Blanchett, I found the story uninteresting, but that was likely because I was too young.  Recently, I ended up buying the film as it was cheap enough to buy.  This time I fell in love with it being older and wiser.  I thought it was beautifully done and an interesting glimpse at who Queen Elizabeth the First was.  The acting was incredible specifically by Cate Blanchett.  This was the first role that catapulted her into movie star status.

This film takes place around the time Elizabeth is imprisoned in the Tower when her sister was on her death bed, and then is quickly released and made Queen.  It allegedly takes place over the first 4 years of her 44 years in power.  There is a part two to this film called, ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"", which touches on the latter years.

The negatives of this film or the unfortunate's is that the filmmakers didn't make this a biopic, but changed a slew of key things for whatever reason.  For that matter, it is sad to say that while this film is exceptional as its own piece, it is not entirely accurate.  There are some things that are accurate, and some things that are fabricated for who knows what reasoning.  The filmmakers were always unable to give anyone an answer that would make sense as to why they did that.  So if you're watching this for a history lesson, you're better off reading a factual book on Elizabeth, but still watch this film for fun.

Cate Blanchett does a terrific job at embodying the temperament of Elizabeth, although in the beginning of this film she acts like an innocent naive ingenue when she was made Queen at the young age of 25.  In truth, the real Elizabeth was already ferociously strong as she grew up under her father's reign, Henry VIII.  A 25 year old back then, is not like a 25 year old today.  They were exceptionally resourceful and regal almost like a 40 year old.  There were a lot of other little things such as her right hand confidante played by Geoffrey Rush, was actually around Elizabeth's age and not the age that Geoffrey Rush is, even though he was great.  It was little things like that.",1499644800,,2227,4.449382716049382

A slew of great actors too!",1497398400,,281,4.6938775510204085
1016017,5,6305358591,"This is a film about the viciousness of English Court during Queen Elizabeth's early reign.  It shows how difficult it was to transfer power from one monarch to the next.  There was political wrangling that makes our Congress look tame- mostly because death was the preferred outcome for your opponent! An interesting part of this historic film is that it includes the Protestant Reformation that was sweeping Europe at the time.  Queen Mary had died- she was the last monarch to institute the terror of the Inquisition upon the people of England.  People were being murdered for religious differences that most did not even understand.  Elizabeth, a Protestant,  was also a brilliant pragmatist who was responsible for bringing her country peace where other European monarchies continued in religious strife. Her solution was to leave the Vatican and create The Church of England (which looked almost the same as Catholicism but where no one was murdered for his or her beliefs).  She survives assassination attempts and pressure to marry by being able to select the best advisors and having the right instincts as a leader.  She also learns to be ruthless when necessary.  I loved this portrayal of Elizabeth because it shows true feminine power- she doesn't try to be a man to lead.  Instead, she becomes fully a woman and in this way, she becomes one of England's most enduring and beloved queens.  You will love this rich insight into court life- the ritualized flirting, the dancing, the makeup, jewelry, dress and intrigue.  These old monarchies were intricately intertwined with the Pope and Catholicism at the time.  Therefore, the Pope had enormous power over kings and queens, their legitimacy and over the hearts and minds of 'common people'. As Americans, we have no such monarchies and don't believe in the idea of genetics being the method by which God chooses our leaders.  Therefore, to see how all that came into play in the political arena is fascinating and this film does an excellent job covering that issue.  Kudos & Bravo!  It simply can't be done any better than 'Elizabeth'!",1495756800,8,2100,4.974212034383954

It's a fantastic film that does take some poetic license with the true facts, but that does not detract from it at all.  Cate Blanchett is magnificent as Elizabeth I, and Geoffrey Rush plays an excellent Walsingham.  Joseph Fiennes is charming but wicked in his duplicity.  The show was, however, almost stolen by the actor who played the nephew of Mary of Guise.  Unfortunately, I've forgotten his name, but he was excellent in his role as the unsuccessful (and very naughty) suitor to Elizabeth.

Cate Blanchett is the perfect Elizabeth I, the acting is brilliant and I remember being extremely disappointed she did not take the Oscar home that year. All of the performances are terrific but a couple of fun points. Kathy Burke, a very funny lady notably from French and Saunders and Absolutely Fabulous, gives a tremendous performance as Mary I. Also, look out of James Bond's Daniel Craig in one of his early roles. I highly recommend this movie.",1459296000,,625,4.6909090909090905

If I could, I would give this movie 5 stars but I'll easily provide 4.899 stars only because there is more to the story not told. Sadly the length allowed for a movie to provide a view of history or a biography is so limited. We are only allowed to see part IV (reminds me of Star Wars-sorry Cate). This Biography of Elizabeth certainly has a prequel and sequels and could easily have become a series. Additionally, I need to confess that I'm a HUGE Cate Blanchett fan and she can so easily become the portrayed person so wonderfully and it seems so easily accomplished by her...

1019155,3,6305358591,The acting was fine but it was not always clear which historical figures each character represented.  The history was of course simplified but there still seemed to be indecisiveness between being true to the fact and simply inventing a good story- with not enough or too much of one or the other.  Not on par with PBS miniseries Wolf Hall which takes place a generation before this film.,1453680000,,388,4.6911764705882355

1019159,4,6305358591,I really enjoyed this film. Its a great look at the Catholic versus Protestant battles in play at her time. It focuses on her rise to the crown and her establishment as the monarch - there was a lot of dissidence at the beginning. I wouldn't rate it as 5 only because they don't really show you the mood in the country - its mostly at the court level.,1453680000,,351,4.101449275362318

The acting is superb, the costumes and sets are superb, I have nothing but praise for this film!  I saw it in the theatre when it first came out, and it was even more phenomenal on the big screen.  Cate Blanchett is incredible in whatever she is in, but I think, if I were to imagine what Queen Elizabeth the 1st looked like and acted like, I would think of Cate Blanchett.  I own the Bette Davis ""The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex"" and Bette Davis is a wonderful Queen Elizabeth - especially with all of her 'isms. I would say that Cate Blanchett is equally as good as the great Bette Davis.  It's fun seeing some of the other actors when they were young, like James Frain!  I hardly recognized him as the Spanish Ambassador, Geoffrey Rush and Christopher Eccleston.  Joseph Fiennes is a very pretty man and still looks relatively the same now as he did then.

Villains abound, with the Catholic Church portrayed as most evil. Interesting take on the interwoven machinations of church and state in Medieval Europe. Daniel Craig is an especially creepy priest-assassin. Plenty of unpleasant behavior is leavened by the grace of one or two good guys. Fascinating take on how a young queen may have come by her devotion to her country. Some truly excellent performances. (One or two real mature, cover-your-eyes scenes, in case you are watching with teens. No one under that age should see it at all.)",1443484800,,667,5.242990654205608

Makes Elizabeth appear much more glamorous than she was.  She was not the saint this movie makes her out to be.  She adored hunting and bear-baiting.  She had absolutely no compassion for the suffering of animals and only spared one deer from the hunt in her life - after she cut off its ears as a souvenir and only then set it free (to bleed to death one assumes). She was moody and unpredictable and shared the vanity of her father, Henry VIII.  Like Dear Old Dad she had the good sense to surround herself with able councilors and, unlike Dear Old Dad, managed to refrain from chopping off their heads, so she was not without a few good points.

I never thought about the dangers presented for a queen, so it was interesting to see Queen Elizabeth's story in a different light. Kate Blanchett is terrific and the movie is well cast. It's visually amazing with beautiful costumes and sets. The director and producers obviously spent a great deal of time planning and executing every scene to be as close as possible in creating the appropriate historical context. Every costume and scene is engaging as the movie takes you back to a time very different from our own.

The only thing is - it is not an Amazon Prime movie, so I had to pay to watch it. The movie is notable and old enough for Amazon to offer it free to their prime members. I was disappointed that they do not and yet have other movies from the same year without the extra charge. What's up with that Amazon?

Only the mini-series have covered her youth & early years as queen, so to have that in a feature film was good to see. Loved the costumes, sets, & visual qualities. My main issue with it is that it is very far off-base in it's handling of Robert Dudley. Despite some occasional rough spots in their relationship, Dudley remained an advisor & confidant of Elizabeth's until his death. In fact, Elizabeth kept a ""treasure box"" beside her bed that contained mementos, special only to her (as many of us do). After her death they found a folded paper in the box with ""His last letter"" written on the outside in Elizabeth's own handwriting. It was, indeed, the last letter that Robert Dudley had written her a few days before his death.",1421712000,3,852,4.57516339869281

Pope Pius V added his excommunication decree, showing even the church believed itself a power worth reckoning and not a peaceful organization for the preservation of men's souls, with priests executing persons, papal mandates, subversion and acts not normally associated with a church. Cate Blanchett is excellent as the young Bess, as she developed into the model of the Virgin Queen, Geoffrey Rush is the essence of the diabolicality, and humerously, as the mischievous Sir Francis Walsingham, Joseph Fiennes is the perfect snake in the grass as Robert Dudley (better than Enemy at the Gates, Christopher Eccleston is at his best in his role as Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk and all-round traitor.

1020585,3,6305358591,"The story of Queen Elizabeth I, from her days as an innocent young woman to her coronation, up to the formation of her reputation as England's stern ""Virgin Queen"". A lush portrait of history, full of pomp, intrigue, and romance and anchored by Blanchett's award-winning performance and colorful direction from Indian newcomer Kapur.

The screenplay, written by Michael Hirst, is strictly a pseudo-biographical account of the rise of one of England most popular and successful monarchs. Though the broad contours of the story are taken from history, Hirst has played fast and loose with many of the particulars.  This film has all the best trappings of a high quality costume drama. Most of the action takes place inside various spacious castles, cathedrals, and the Tower of London. There are some outdoor shots in expansive meadows, in the woods, or on the Thames. The costumes are magnificent. The make-up, especially that which transforms Elizabeth into the Virgin Queen near the film's end, is exceptional.

The highlight of this film is a superlative performance by Cate Blanchett. Blanchett not only looks the part of Elizabeth, but ably handles the transition from innocent and nave young lady, to an initially uncertain young monarch.  Though it is clearly Blanchett who carries this film and makes it worth watching, she is ably supported by a fine cast, most notably Christopher Eccleston as Norfolk, Geoffrey Rush as Walsingham. Richard Attenborough as Sir William Cecil and James Frain as the Spanish ambassador.",1413676800,,1525,5.2122448979591836

""Elizabeth"" is the inspiring story of the illegitimate daughter of Henry VIII and Ann Boleyn who, against all odds, proved that a woman not only does not need a man but can also be the queen of a kingdom about to collapse and bring it to what was considered its golden age.

[originally posted 22Oct2000]

I half-figured I wasn't going to get what everyone else saw in this film when my reaction to the first scene was ""okay, I like burning bodies as much as the next guy, but what did that have to do with the story?"" And variations on that theme never really left me as the story unfolded. I wondered while picking this up how even a fraction of the tale of Elizabeth's rise to power could be depicted in two hours; for some reason I'd thought this movie was almost twice that long. And perhaps I wasn't paying close enough attention, or perhaps this film requires repeated viewings to really grasp its brilliance. Or, maybe, it's a chick flick. (Check the ratings breakdown at IMDB.com. Suddenly I don't feel nearly as bad about not liking this as much as everyone else seemed to.)

It's certainly not a bad film, though I think a good deal of the supporting cast's roles were written to be overplayed, which is the same problem I have with many period dramas. It just seems as if it's there as a kind of Cliffs Notes version of Elizabeth's rise to power. Maybe I'm wrong in this, but given the many, many accolades received by the film, I expected something more-- piercing, original insight into Elizabeth's character, a new take on her inner circle of advisors, a revelation that she actually wasn't a virgin, something. Instead, it was your basic history book, abbreviated. ** ",1389139200,,1441,4.687747035573122

he is just lusting over her the whole time. We find out his true colors
when he rapes and kills that one girl that really like him. She finally
realizes HE is a whore and says so with, ""you aren't going to make
ME a whore. I just wish there would have been ONE good romance
shown in the movie between Elizabeth and a GOOD man. But no,
we had to suffer through the majority of the movie on that repulsive
man with the dark hair and dark eyes, her ""luster."" He worshiped her
status is what it was about for him. I wish she would have caught that about
him sooner. And they made her out to be so smart in the movie, yet this
was the stupidest oversight on her part. Is the message that Queen Elizabeth couldn't pick good men?
I think so. And the rape scene was unsettling to the soul. They could have been a little subtler on letting
us know that he is indeed, a terrible man. That was just distasteful to me.
  Another aspect of the movie was the repulsive officials in the church.
 An interesting view of the depravity of man in the church
 I think of Jesus our Christ reeming out the church officials in the whole
chapter of Matthew 23.  ..""You hold the kingdom of heaven before the children-
of-men. For you-are not entering, and those that are entering, you are not letting

One would have to know the background and saga of Henry VIII, the Reformation, and the establishment of the Church of England, to understand the beginning of the film, and the implications of Catholics vs. Protestants throughout the movie.  But the costumes, the English culture, the revelation of the power of the Catholic church--whether true to not, is fascinating and worth watching.  It is hard to believe what one person will do to another in the name of God, which Shekar Kapur brings out in the film.  Cate Blanchett is an excellent actor and fairs well among a very fine cast, under a very gifted director, Shekhar Kapur. I especially enjoyed Geoffrey Rush and Richard Attenborough. When it comes to acting, one must admit that the Brits are exceptional.

I loved watching Elizabeth's character grow from a carefree young woman to a daunting rival to those who challenged her rule, yet she was kind despite the need to harden her heart at times. She did what she had to do to keep the peace in her country. You couldn't help but feel the conflict in her emotions as she rose in power. Cate did a great job in this role and it is probably one of her best performances. Her emotions were relayed so well in her expressions. And Joseph Fiennes, well, he's just a sexy guy as well as a compelling actor. His character was passionate and if you watched his face you could see he truly loved Elizabeth.

I felt it was a bit too graphic/bloody & turned my stomach a bit which is not necessary for a good historical drama as I have seen many of them.  Also the history was not accurate.  I don't think there is historical proof that Queen Elizabeth had carnal relations with Earl Robert Dudley although they were good friends & very fond of each other.  Elizabeth was too smart for that & she wouldn't have wanted to become pregnant out-of-wedlock.  Also she was never alone, having ladies in waiting & other court personnel constantly around her person. She was also aware that the Earl was married to Amy Robsart. Robert Dudley was politically ambitious & most likely used his relationship with Elizabeth to further his cause at court.  Also the film portrayed Elizabeth as uncertain of herself & weak, & as Henry VIII's daughter I'm sure she was much more in command - she had to be in order to survive - which she did quite well.  I prefer Glenda Jackson's portrayal of Elizabeth as more historically accurate & how a queen would comport  herself.  There was too much emphasis on the erroneus sexual aspect between Dudley & Elizabeth & the scene of the French prince in drag I found obnoxious, & this was not historically accurate either.  The musical score was good, although not quite historically accurate however, blending Mozart with Elizabethan music. I would not recommend this historically inaccurate movie for purchase, but for those who like the actors in the drama & like visual effects & are not sticklers for history it might be worth a viewing.",1377561600,,1637,4.712280701754386

But, the plots don't really grind against each other, the turning points are not natural progressions of each other and the story limps along without being driven by Elizabeth. For example, most of the Monarchy plot turning points are not effected by Elizabeth herself, instead they are by luck (Queen Mary dies, she is declared queen) and by others (Walsingham captures the priest and all the traitors). The Controlling Idea does not feel proven, it does not feel that she HAD to become the Virgin Queen to save her Monarchy and England. The sequel is much tighter in driving home its idea. Given this story, I'm surprised a sequel was given a chance to see the light of day.

As director, Shekar Kapur gives us a very interesting interpretation of the young queen's surviving a staggering maze of hazards, attaining and holding the throne, and establishing herself as a real queen, wielding actual power on her own, not as some man's property.
There is a symmetry between the opening scene, with the Protestant martyrs' heads being shaved to prepare them for being burned at the stake; and the last scenes, with Elizabeth having her girlish long locks shaved off and replaced by a wig, worn with white-face makeup, to show how she had sacrificed her girlhood and ""weaker sex"" emotionality to become the remote, iconic Queen, now beyond all ordinary human concerns.",1373500800,,824,5.0661764705882355

I agree with the fact others have said. If you are looking for historical accuracy from this movie I would only expect about 60% to be accurate. They pretty much condensed the years of Elizabeth's life from 1554 to 1565 into two and half hours of film. They also confused the fact that her father Henry the 8th created the modern Church of England. I give them full marks for accuracy on the costuming and set design.

1021644,5,6305358591,"Shekar's Elizabeth compresses many years of Queen Elizabeth's reign into an apparently short time, and changes some events for dramatic effect. The result is a stunning spectacle of Elizabethan life and politics that simplifies and sometimes deviates from history, but is never dull. For example, Mary of Guise, Regent of Scotland and mother of Elizabeth's nemesis, Mary Queen of Scots, was not seduced and killed by Walsingham. She died of dropsy. Of course, showing the grotesquely swollen body of someone with dropsy would have had a very different cinematic  effect than the sight of slender and lovely Fanny Ardant. And William Cecil was not retired by the young Elizabeth so she could run her own affairs. He was only 38 at Elizabeth's coronation (unlike the octogenarian actor who portrays him in the film) and continued to be her most trusted adviser on the privy council for 40 years until he died, and was succeeded by his son, Robert Cecil.

But perhaps the greatest deviation of the film from history is its portrayal of Elizabeth's favorite, Robert Dudley, as a shallow boy toy. The real Robert Dudley was tall and athletic and an expert jouster. His main attraction for Elizabeth, however, was his mind. Like Elizabeth, he had a classical education, and was fluent in French and Italian. But he also studied science and mathematics, was a brilliant conversationalist, and (most important) could make her laugh. In the HBO miniseries, Elizabeth I, Jeremy Irons portrays Robert Dudley and his relations with Elizabeth (played by Helen Mirren) much more accurately. Good as the miniseries is, though, one can't help thinking that sometimes Shekar's film (in the spirit of Thucidides) shows us what people should have said and done (rather than what they actually said and did), because it would have made better drama.",1361145600,,1829,5.073089700996678

Neither of us knew anything about the movie nor had we read any reviews so we had no warning or preparation for what we were about to see. My biggest impression out of this movie was a sincere feeling of gratitude that I was born in the United States.

The movie is interesting but also depressing; there is very good acting but miserable, distorted lives are being portrayed. One is left with a slightly dirty feeling and recognition that things are really not so bad in the good ole USA. One begins to wonder if the inbreeding of the nobility hadn't already begun to cause serious problems in the gene pool. There were really no sympathetic characters with whom we could relate at any level. Whereas the movie was instructional it was not entertaining.

Although we appreciated the quality of the acting, it won numerous Academy Awards; the story was depressing and dark. It is not a family film and this is one I suggest you view before you buy. We will probably never watch it again.",1337385600,2,1081,4.56701030927835
1021858,4,6305358591,"Like all court dramas, it's not always easy to tell who is doing what to whom. I suppose that's the nature of royal courts, at least back when they held real power.

Elizabeth held real power, and therefore was threatened on all sides. Cate Blanchett plays a very convincing Elizabeth, from the time when she was a princess in seclusion in the country and her crazy sister Mary sent for her to try to persuade her to keep England Catholic, and lock her in the Tower of London on general paranoia. She was clearly in love with Lord Robert Dudley (Joseph Fiennes), at least until she was told he was already married.

Advisers wanted her to marry the king of either Spain or France, arguing that her throne would not be safe until she had married and produced an heir. Oddly enough, they only mentioned Catholic kings. But Sir Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush) advises her to take care, and not get involved with either France or Spain. France was allied with Scotland and Mary, Queen of Scots, was trying to claim England for Catholicism. Spain had some plots of its own.

Then word gets to the Queen that the Duke of Norfolk is plotting an alliance with Mary to raise a claim to the English throne, and Elizabeth realizes she has no choice but to deal harshly and summarily with the Catholic plotters. She then talks it over with Walsingham and realizes she must be the Virgin Queen for England, to replace their devotion to the Virgin Mary with devotion to herself.

That's the rough outline of the story, but the story is in the details, some gruesome, some passionate, and all filled with spectacular costumes and sets. It's a lavish production about royalty, and you won't miss the fact that it's long ago when things were rather more brutal than they are today.

Cate Blanchett will make you believe in Elizabeth as a force for civilization.",1336953600,2,1847,4.636085626911315

1021861,1,6305358591,"Anti-Catholicism is the last acceptable prejudice, especially in Hollywood, and it will continue to be as long as the Catholic Church remains an influential force in the world. There's an especially disgusting depiction of a clandestine Catholic priest beating a Protestant nobleman to death, and many more false ahistorical distortions await unsuspecting Catholic viewers of this film.

Allow me to bring these unfortunate viewers back from this imaginary world and into reality once again. In Elizabethan England, Catholics were so feared that they were subjected to the cruelest executions imaginable. Catholics were hung, disemboweled, and castrated (all in the same execution) while they were still alive. Then they were made to watch as their bowels and innards were burned before their eyes, all at Queen Elizabeth's ordering. Even the Nazis and the Tojos (Japanese Imperials) seldom tortured their victims in so horrible a manner (God rest their souls). In Elizabethan England, this was standard fare.

Similarly Ireland and the Catholic Church therein were utterly raped as Protestant Elizabethan purges attempted to eliminate the predominating Catholic gentry, as well as Catholic clergy. There are hundreds of English and Irish Catholic martyrs from this period of history.

The atrocities committed by Mary Tudor paled in comparison. It's one thing to tell an honest, impartial story about a controversial historical figure, such as Queen Elizabeth, but it's quite another to lionize this figure, gloss over the atrocities she committed, and portray the innocent victims (eg Catholic priests) of her persecutions as the original aggressors (isn't that how the Axis regimes protrayed their victims?). That alone makes this film propaganda. It's like making a film extolling the scientific achievements of Hitler and the Third Reich and not mentioning the Holocaust.

Contrast the reign of Elizabeth with her father, King Henry VIII. Elizabeth and Henry were the early-modern forebears of twentieth century dictators like Hitler. They were both paranoid tyrants who tortured and persecuted religious minorities such as Catholics (St. Thomas More is a very famous Catholic martyr of Henry VIII, and ironically, a member of his court), as well as their political opponents, and yet I've NEVER seen a single positive film portrayal of Henry VIII. What's worse however, is that our modern disgust with Henry VIII is usually generated by little more than a visceral, modern (though completely justified) distaste with violence committed against women, that is, his execution of his wives. As far as Henry's other crimes, we're all historically ignorant and it seems we couldn't care less. Elizabeth carried her father's torch, and continued his bloody work, to an even greater degree.

Elizabeth presided over England at an historic time, there's no doubt about it, but, in view of the atrocities she committed, she can never be accorded this level of honor and praise for the same reason other tyrants like Ivan the Terrible and Vlad the Impaler (or in the modern era, Hitler or Stalin) still merit our disgust despite their status as world-changing historical figures. The fact that 2 movies have been made unabshedly celebrating the historic achievements of this woman (ELIZABETH), without showing her darker, more bloodthirsty side, is beyond me.",1334102400,7,3355,5.407265774378585

Elizabeth, queen of England, a Protestant, is his nemesis. Elizabeth's advisers advise her to be careful of English Catholics. Elizabeth brushes away their fears, but they are right. She has imprisoned her sister Mary who is Catholic and who Philip wants to see enthroned in England. He sends an assassin to England to kill Elizabeth so that Mary could take the throne. Elizabeth is also advised that she should find a husband so that she can have a child; otherwise the people would prefer Mary who has had a child who could rule after her death. We watch Elizabeth falling in love with Walter Raleigh, a bandit who robs Spanish ships. We see the internal castle intrigue as Elizabeth's lady in waiting, her favorite, also falls for Raleigh.

1021911,4,6305358591,"Queen Elizabeth, sometimes known as ""Good Queen Bess"" was a towering figure in English history.  She presided over the transformation of Britain (England, really) from a poor backward country into perhaps the richest nation in the world.  As an American less familiar with English history than my British cousins, I cannot speak to the various historical inaccuracies that other reviewers have noted here.  But this film is a lavish spectacle that acquaints the viewer with the early portion of Elizabeth's reign and rule.  The central theme is her deft manipulation of stronger nations in favor of England by her tactic of dangling the possibility of a royal marriage in front of them.  This film gives the viewer a feel for what Elizabeth might have been like, and her political attitudes including her disdain for religious strife, i.e. Catholic versus Protestant.  Elizabeth's attitude towards marriage is summed up in the film by her icy announcement that she was ""married to England.""  And so she was.

This is an engrossing and enjoyable film.  For the American viewer who is doubtless less familiar with English history, it serves as a fine and entertaining introduction to Queen Elizabeth.  Recommended.  RJB.",1324857600,,1218,5.163265306122449

1021916,5,6305358591,"This review is dedicated to my dearest friend E who's birthday is 11/27.

This film is a real 5 star masterpiece. This is a historical film that does take some artistic liberties. King Henry VIII has recently died, and his evil daughter 'Bloody Mary' is on the throne. King Henry VIII had some issues and faults. But despite that, he was actually a really great king. (He built up the navy well, authorized the Bible's translation into English, freed England from Rome's corruption, kept the control his father Henry VII had established after the War of the Roses, and even held England together during the uncertainties of the Reformation.

Mary I seems to have inherited her father's issues without any of his redeeming qualities. She seems to be desperate to hang onto a crown and control that she will inevitably lose. (She even considers killing her own sister Elizabeth.)

Elizabeth seems to be a sympathetic character throughout most of this film. First she is virtually Mary's prisoner. When Mary dies, Elizabeth of course becomes queen. But she is already being manipulated by certain parties that seek to dethrone her. (Even to the point of giving her advice that will damage England.) She has enemies both foreign and domestic. We also see that the Bishops are against her.

Add to that that she gradually finds out that while she loves Robert Dudley, he is in fact a married man. (Needless to say, she doesn't take to this well.)

Cate Blanchett really embodies the daughter of King Henry VIII. In her trials, she is cautious. Sometimes she shows an untapped power. Yet she can also be sympathetic and vulnerable.

At times, Geoffrey Rush steals the film as Elizabeth's advisor and protector. (Kind of a medieval FBI agent.) He is very loyal and very good at his job. At times he does seem almost evil. But we could easily argue that he needs to 'fight fire with fire' as he takes on the many enemies of Elizabeth. Geoffrey Rush will probably always be remembered by most as Captaim Hector Barbossa. But in my opinion, Walsingham is really his best performance.

Elizabeth has many political enemies. But perhaps the most disturbing thing about this film is all the people who want to kill Elizabeth in the name of God. (Including the Pope. Performed by the 96 year old legendary John Gielgud.)

Geoffrey Rush comes through and flips the tables. But to the director's credit, we are somewhat disturbed as Geoffrey Rush takes down Elizabeth's opposition. (Violence is disturbing even if the good side is winning.)

Perhaps the most satisfying part is that at the start of the film, Geoffrey Rush survives and flips the tables on an assassination attempt. He knows who did it, and even has fun by greeting the man behind the failed attempt in a friendly civil manner. And in the end, he has the pleasure of arresting him for plotting against Elizabeth.

The scenery is phenomenal. We also have drama, comedy, mystery, and suspense.

This movie was a phenomenal masterpiece. I was happy to give this as a gift to someone on the happiest day of my life.

1022005,4,6305358591,"The story of Queen Elizabeth is a remarkable one. It has been told over the years several times through many films and documentaries. This movie captures the story of a single time in the queens life, when she is crowned and is pushed to quickly find herself a King to share her thrown.

Much of the film's beginning is dark and filled with quiet whispering. Rooms barely lit with candle light and often the scenes are so soft spoken one has to strain to hear what's being said. After Elizabeth is crowned Queen, the setting seems to brighten and whispers give way to normal dialogue.

Right from the start the movie is intense and filled with action. The time period has the Catholics and the Protestants waging wars of the church against each other. There is blood, violence, sexual situations and brief nudity, so obviously this is not a film for children to learn their history from.

In trying to capture a very intense love story from English history, this movie is extremely well done.

After The Tudors season one was slaughtered with reviews by people who love Tudor history, season two became way more watchable and I'm hoping that Michael Hirst will rewrite Elizabeth I as the next Showtime series. He can do Elizabeth way more honor than this movie and the The Golden Age.

1022101,4,6305358591,"I'll try to make this as succinct as possible, this is a film you will want to watch for the quality of the performances, the camerawork, the elaborate costumes and settings, and the intriguing, overstuffed story.  However, if you were a student using this film as a study aid for a test on the initial reign of Elizabeth I, you'd flunk for sure!  The truth is stretched so far that if it were a spring it would break and snap back with a loud BOING!  What a pity, since the Tudor dynasty is strong enough to stand on the actual facts to spin an enthralling tale dramatically without all the phony embellishments.

The story begins in the last years of the reign of the pathetic Queen Mary Tudor (Kathy Burke) of England who is slowly dying of a tumor.  Obsessed with her Roman Catholic religion, abandoned by her husband King Phillip of Spain, ill advised by the powerful Duke of Norfolk (Christopher Eccleston), and other nobility and clergy she is near breakdown both physically and mentally.  She allows herself to be persuaded that her younger half sister the Princess Elizabeth (Cate Blanchett), heir to her crown, yet a Protestant is a possible traitor.  Mary has Elizabeth transported and confined to the Tower of London.  Although Mary has little love for Elizabeth, she cannot believe her guilty of treason and refuses to have her executed or disinherited.  Elizabeth is eventually released to Hatfield one of her country estates where she lives quietly until Mary dies and she assumes the throne.  However, her triumph is short lived as the fledgling queen is beset by serious problems, the treasury is empty, England threatened with an unfriendly neighbor, Scotland, the religious question divides the country, and she is pressured to marry and produce an heir.  In addition she has to juggle an importunate lover Sir Robert Dudley (Joseph Fiennes),  a secretary of state who seeks to govern her, Sir William Cecil (Sir Richard Attenborough),  her enigmatic director of security Sir Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush), and the treacherous Duke of Norfolk who continues to be a malign presence.

Front and center in this heady swirl of pageantry, sex, intrigue and melodrama is the star making performance of Cate Blanchett as the young Elizabeth.  I'd never seen Ms. Blanchett before this film, and I was astounded at just how accomplished she was in developing her portrayal.  Elizabeth Tudor was one of the most complex, brilliant women in history, a true Renaissance ""Prince"" in the Machiavellian sense.  She was capricious, a mass of contradictions, formidably intelligent yet neurotic, cool headed but possessed of a fiery temper, charismatic yet kept most people at arms length.  In turn she could be lion hearted, petty, shrewd, vain, generous, coquettish, diplomatic, bull headed, charming, devious and ruthless.  Ms. Blanchett is able to evoke most of these characteristics as she undergoes Elizabeth's journey from the vulnerable, imperiled princess at the beginning to the iconic, majestic Gloriana at the end, without ever losing the audience's interest or sympathy.  One of my favorite scenes is when Elizabeth is preparing to address a session of Parliament on the topic of religious conformity.  She makes the queen endearingly human as she nervously rehearses her speech aloud by herself, forgetting pieces, making corrections, getting frustrated and angry the same as any college student preparing for their first lengthy speech in Effective Presentation 101.  In terms of her appearance in the coronation scene at Westminster Abbey, clad in an ermine mantle over cloth of gold, jeweled gold crown perched atop her loose, flowing strawberry blonde hair Ms. Blanchett uncannily mirrors a famous portrait of Elizabeth in her coronation regalia. Her compelling, muti faceted portrayal heralded the arrival of an exciting, young actress brimming over with talent.  Deservedly her achievement was rewarded with a Best Actress Oscar nomination and wins for both the Golden Globe and the British Film Academy Awards for Best Actress.

Just as a fine diamond will sparkle more dazzlingly in the proper setting, an impressive supporting cast adds to the luster of Ms. Blanchett's portrait.  Heading this list is another newcomer, Joseph Fiennes, who as Elizabeth's great passion Sir Robert Dudley, greatly resembles a younger version of an actual portrait of Dudley with his brooding, gypsy like looks, and acts with a feverish recklessness.  Geoffrey Rush brings a cold blooded pragmatism to Sir Francis Walsingham, while Sir Richard Attenborough ably brings out the self-serving interest of Sir William Cecil.  The malevolence of Christopher Eccleston's Norfolk makes him a truly dangerous adversary to Elizabeth.  As the foppish, giddy Duke of Anjou, a would be suitor of Elizabeth, Vincent Cassel brings some moments of comic relief to the heavy drama.  The hysterical Queen Mary of Kathy Burke, a woman haunted by her failures evokes pity.  There is also a glimpse of the future James Bond, as Daniel Craig plays a small but key role as the Jesuit priest Father John Ballard.  Finally, in one of his last roles, theatrical great Sir John Gielgud has a quick cameo as the Pope.

The settings and costumes are opulent and magnificent, all the splendors of Elizabeth's court, a Renaissance tapestry brought to life, the musical score is effectively used to underscore the events unfolding on the screen.  All were rewarded with Oscar nomiinations, a total of seven in all including Best Picture.  However the only trophy won was by Jenny Shicore for Best Makeup.

Regarding the extras, director Shekhar Kupur does a commentary, an insightful glimpse into the vision of the film, and there are two good featurettes, the better of the two is ""The Making of Elizabeth"", which is more developed, but the second one ""Elizabeth"" is also worth a look.  Also when this DVD was released, the inferior sequel ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"" was soon to open, there is a sneak peak at that as well.

Though the film will certainly hold the average person's interest, the danger is that the uninformed viewer will take this very loose dramatic interpretation as the actual history of Elizabeth I and her early reign. So, by all means watch this if for no other reason than the glittering performance of Cate Blanchett, without it I would certainly drop the rating at least by one star.  Please remember though to go into this cleared eyed with the definite understanding that this is the writer and director's dramatic interpretation of the Elizabethan Age, and not the way it really was.  And, if you want to get a more accurate, balanced glimpse into a fascinating queen, try reading Alison Weir's excellent biography ""The Life of Elizabeth I"", published in 1998 the same year ""Elizabeth"" was released.",1312156800,4,6810,5.089928057553957
1022102,4,6305358591,"If I were judging this film solely on the merits of its fidelity to history, it would fail by a wide margin: it condenses many decades worth of events into a few brief years, plays fast and loose with several real characters fates, and occasionally creates an outright fabrication. Judged as pure drama, however, this flick is a resounding success. The set design and cinematography are very good, and ably convey the sense that the atmospheres of both England and the Tudor court at this time were dangerous. The supporting cast is reliably good (even Joseph Fiennes, whom I've always regarded as a bit of a weak link in any production he appears in, is watchable). And as for Blanchett... Shes extraordinarily good here, convincingly essaying Elizabeth's evolution from a nave and inexperienced ruler into a ruthless pragmatist. Fine stuff indeed.

1022107,5,6305358591,"This movie is the seminal work whose beauty and perfect execution and casting inspired writers of a number of excellent books in its wake. Elizabeth incited a devoted following by presenting the story of the young queen with new insights into the pivotal influences that affected her life, and the course of history.

The beginning of the movie presents us with an England in turmoil: catholic-dominated because of its barren queen, and poised on the edge of internal change because Mary must pass the crown to her hated sister Elizabeth, a protestant, at the time of her death. Elizabeth assumes her regency surrounded by enemies within her cabinet, but having two allies: Lord Robert, a romantic interest and nobleman, and Walsingham, a heretofore unmentioned force in british history who is initially appointed as the queen's chief body guard. Throughout the rest of the story, Walsingham emerges as a ruthless defender of the queen's success. Many books have since adjusted their focus in writing about the virgin queen to include this previously unsung power behind the throne. Lord Walsingham is portrayed by Geoffrey Rush as a man who gives his queen only as much as a fair chance. For success, the real queen relied on her native wit and intelligence to guide her country though religious and political crisis.

Liberties are taken in terms of the timing of certain events and historical figures, but the screenplay and perfect casting of this film well outweigh factual flaws. At the time this movie came to the theater, Ms. Blanchette was an unknown. Her performance in this debut has none of the rough edges of other actors' early films.

But after watching Elizabeth R, The Six Wives of Henry VIII and reading a number of historical books authored by reputable authors like Alison Weir, I found this film to be more along the lines of historical fiction. But some dialogue and details are so egregious they could not be overlooked. For example, Elizabeth saying 'This small issue of religion.' Even the atheists of the age wouldn't have dared say this more less a princess of the crown jewel of Christendom, whose father was at one time regarded as 'Defender of the Faith'(being Catholicism). Next, in the same scene, Norfolk says in response that it was religion that killed her mother. No, adultery was the charge, not heresy. The dots are not even in near proximity for such a claim. A little later, Walsingham makes a four inch slice on some kids neck and he dies? Who was he? Why did he want to kill Walsingham, why would a superficial 'flesh wound'no where near an artery kill him? Anyway, this is just my opinion and my desire is to help someone make a decision regarding the expenditure of time and money. If you are not a history buff, this movie may be entertaining.

The story is deep and serious, the characters amazingly well developed, the film about which you can come away having developed some knowledge of English history, Biographical insight, court intrigues, political infighting, and endless machinations that both impress and shock us at the same time.

The England of Elizabeth's time was a cruel, dirty, squalid place.  With amazing degrees of class distinction this movie gives us a valid look at the inner workings of royal rights of succession.  The terrors and fears of those in the wake of some great personage clearly shown as they have not been show any recent period film.

From the heights to the depths of English society we see vast separation between the haves and the have nothings!  From those in power and those with none.  Glory in dress, in courtly manners, in degrees of civility between those haves and have-nots, on display for anyone to witness and judge for themselves.  Then we see the squalor, cruelty and an honest look at the people who made up the mass of society under Elizabeth's reign.

We find ourselves sitting as judges on a great queen and her life and times.  Yes she is an incredible Exclamation Mark in history as was Eleanor of Aquitaine, and another rare women Boudica - Queen of the Iceni who stood against the Roman Legions and almost won her nations freedom.

Elizabeth's plight--personal, political, religious, human--is exquisitely vivid and wrenching.  We see her go through bitter and terrifying shocks, and grow before our very eyes, both as a woman and a politician.

At the end, she seems both superhuman and entirely sad: cut off by her partly self-chosen supreme isolation.

1022277,4,6305358591,"Elizabeth, the bastard daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, is a Protestant, and considered an enemy of the Catholic Queen Mary. As more Protestants start an uprising against the Catholic throne, Mary brings Elizabeth before her to be tried and sentenced for treason as a heretic. Instead, Mary is unable to condemn her half sister to death, and tells her that she is dying of a tumor and when she dies Elizabeth will become queen. At the age of 25 Elizabeth becomes queen of England and must deal with affairs, death threats, attempted murder, and plots from within her own administration to become the Virgin Queen who brought England back to prosperity and prominence.

In 1998, Cate Blanchett was an unknown having only appeared in bit parts here and there, but was more well known on the stage. After considering Nicole Kidman, and turning down Meryl Streep (one of only three roles she has ever been turned down for), Shekhar Kapur, an acclaimed Indian filmmaker making his English language debut, saw a trailer with Cate Blanchett and knew that he found the perfect Queen Elizabeth. And this was a daunting task. Queen Elizabeth is a well revered monarch, and not much is known about the early years of her reign. Piecing together what we know of Elizabeth's life and her reign, Michael Hirst crafted a screenplay that shows how Elizabeth became the queen, and woman, she would become. The question is, how well does it work.

Elizabeth is possibly the most beautiful period piece I have ever seen. The cinematography is amazing, the sets and costumes are absolutely breathtaking, and Shekhar Kapur has an eye for bringing out the most in all of it. Shekhar Kapur also brings a more worldly view of the world as well, not just looking at this as the tale of British nobility, but looking at it as a story for the world of coming of age, politics, and religion mixing with politics and the dangers there in. Hirst's characters are well crafted and lived in, which typically is a problem for most period pieces dealing with real subjects. All too often characterizations suffer in these cases because there are so many people who helped make old mold your central character, but Hirst handles these issues deftly to craft great characters and you either empathize with or despise.

The acting pedigree in this movie is stellar, and the ensemble cast of course makes the best of a great script. The real standout for me was Joseph Fiennes, currently the main character in Flashforward but also known for being in the other great period piece of 1998 Shakespeare in Love. Joseph Fiennes plays his character, Robert Dudley, with love, anger, malice, and sadness. He imbues him with such likability that, even at his worst, you feel every tick of emotion within the character, and Joseph Fiennes wrings ever bit of emotion from the character to the last drop without ever feeling as though he's going over the top. Naturally, though, when you're dealing with a cast that includes Geoffrey Rush (Pirates of the Caribbean), Christopher Eccleston (Dr. Who), Cate Blanchett (The Aviator), Daniel Craig (Casino Royale), Sir Richard Attenborough (Jurassic Park, and a phenomenal director in his own right see Ghandi), and so on saying one actor is a standout is like picking the best lawyer out of a group of Ivy League grads who all graduated at the top of their class.

The one problem that I have to say that I have with this film is that the side plot dealing with Eccleston's Duke of Norfolk and the Vatican seemed slightly undercooked. It just didn't seem as though it was given the attention it needed, and in turn the Duke of Norfolk wasn't given enough to due. He's still fleshed out, but it feels as though your made to believe that he's the sole leader in a plot but I never really completely got the feeling that he was as in control as you were made to believe. Of course, when the real focus of the film is the coming of age of Queen Elizabeth I, this is almost an afterthought, and the plot still shows you how this led to Queen Elizabeth becoming the monarch she became.

I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes period pieces, history, and fans of the actors and actresses mentioned above. Personally, I think this is the best work from most of those mentioned above, including Cate Blanchett, which is saying a lot.

1022364,4,6305358591,"There is no question that Elizabeth I was the greatest Queen, and possibly the greatest monarch of either gender, that England ever had,and Cate Blanchett does an excellent job of bringing her vividly to life in Shekhar Kapur's film.  Elizabeth assumed the throne at a very young age and ruled England for over 40 years, during which time she guided her country from poverty and turmoil to peace and unpredecented power and prosperity.

Blanchett expertly portrays Elizabeth's progress from a carefree adolescent with blooming with health and vitality, a frightened young woman expecting to be sent to the execution block at any moment by her spiteful sister Queen Mary who has been abandoned by her husband Philip of Spain and racked with pains from the cancer that is killing her, an insecure young monarch endeavoring to earn the respect of her court and her country, to a hardened woman approaching thirty, still young but no longer trusting anything but her own instincts.  Am I to be made of stone, feeling nothing? she demands after she has sent a number of traitors to the headsman.  And her answer to that question is to reinvent herself.  She will be re-virginized, married only to England and her people, devoting her life and her love to her country and her subjects.

The film has been criticized as anti-Catholic and a good many of the villains in the movie are portrayed as Catholics trying to dethrone Elizabeth at best or kill her at worst.  It is a historical fact that the Vatican tried to destabilize her reign by declaring that no Catholic in England had to obey her or her laws and referred to Elizabeth as ""the heretical whore"" who had no right to occupy the throne in the first place.  Religion was the prime motivating force behind much of the conflict in 16th century England, with Mary Tudor burning Protestants at the stake and anti-Catholic regulations being promulgated after Mary's death.  There is no real anti-Catholic bias in the movie that I could find.  But the number of historical bloopers is mind-boggling, and the following are just a few of the more egregious ones:

When Elizabeth is interrogated by a group of religious inquisitors at the beginning of the film, they claim that it was Anne Boleyn's heretical Protestantism that caused her to be executed.  Her religion had nothing to do with it.  Henry VIII had her put out of the way on a trumped-up charge of adultery and incest because he had fallen in love with another woman.

William Cecil, portrayed as an old man in the movie, was still in his thirties at Elizabeth's accession.  He was her most trusted counselor and served her faithfully for 40 years until his death.  He was not put out to pasture as the film would have us believe.  And Francis Walsingham was not middle-aged as portrayed in the film; he was in his mid-twenties when Elizabeth became Queen.

Lord Robert Dudley, who may or may not have been Elizabeth's lover, was a loyal friend until his death and never betrayed her in real life as he was said to have done in the film.  And as a hard-line Protestant all his life, he never converted to Catholicism.  The film shows Elizabeth as astounded and outraged when William Cecil breaks the news of Dudley's marriage.  In real life she couldn't have been all that surprised, as she attended the wedding.

There is no evidence whatever that Walsingham was in any way involved in the death of Anne of Guise, who died only a year into Elizabeth's reign and not by poison.

And so it goes.  The historical license may have made for more action and drama, but as history, ""Elizabeth"" falls way short of reality.

The acting, however, can't be faulted on any account.  Cate Blanchett, as mentioned above, gives a knockout performance as Elizabeth, Geoffrey Rush is a compelling mixture of suavity and menace as Walsingham, Joseph Fiennes is marvelous as Robert Dudley, hopelessly in love with a woman he can never hope to have, John Gielgud and Richard Attenborough are outstanding in their respective roles as the Pope and William Cecil, and Kathy Burke is almost painful to watch as Mary Tudor, eaten up with cancer, hating and yet unable to sign the death warrant of the sister she knows will bring England back to the Protestantism she abhors and abominates.  I really wish I could give this film five stars.  But the appalling license taken with Elizabeth's life and reign forces me to withhold the last star and give it only four.

Secondly, at the beginning of the movie, the guard who comes to arrest Elzabeth calls out ""Princess Elizabeth!""

Also, there's no evidence that Francis Walsingham (in reality in his 20's when Elizabeth ascended the throne) was involved in the death of Mary Of Guise, who in one scene, is riding in front of her troops. Back then, reigning women DID NOT ride at the front of their troops and rarely rode their horses with both legs over the side. Just some interesting historical details.

1022369,4,6305358591,"Partially reinventing the period movie, stylistically at least, almost as radically as Martin Scorsese reinvented the Biblical epic with his Last Temptation, Shekhur Kapur's account of the insecure early days of Elizabeth I's reign, Elizabeth, is a claustrophobic film set in a dark world of cold grey stone, alternating overhead shots with tight medium shots rather than stressing spectacle or glamour, more political thriller than costume epic. Indeed, with its bloody finale clearly inspired by The Godfather as Walsingham takes care of business for his Capo di tutti Capo, it's almost a mafia movie, with Cate Blanchett's star-making turn as Elizabeth filling in the Michael Corleone role as the heir apparent who must ruthlessly shed emotions and conscience to hold on to the throne. That journey from fresh-faced youth to impregnable white-faced icon gives the film a solid emotional arc that helps prevent it from becoming a simple series of confrontations and thwarted conspiracies, almost - but not quite - turning it into a tragedy of success rather than the usual tragedy of failure that is usually the lot of women in historical pictures (Anne of the Thousand Days, Mary Queen of Scots, Lady Jane, La Reine Margot, etc).

It's handsomely cast: Joseph Fiennes gives good shallow romanticism as Elizabeth's lover Dudley, Christopher Eccleston in his default misery guts mode makes a fine villain and there's a healthy cast that, if not bursting with A-listers, is at least filled with familiar faces, from Richard Attenborough, Fanny Ardant, Daniel Craig and Vincent Cassel in a dress to Edward Hardwicke, Kelly McDonald, James Frain, Emily Mortimer and Eric Cantona. Yet perhaps even more than Blanchett it's a magnificent Geoffrey Rush who often dominates the film from the sidelines as the Queen's loyal and utterly unscrupulous spymaster Sir Francis Walsingham, a man who can seem all things to all men and women but is loyal only to her. Even when he's simply observing from afar he's a powerful presence in all the right ways, emanating a callous intelligence that is truly frightening.

It's strange that the sequel has been attacked by the Vatican as anti-Catholic when this first chapter probably occupies a high place on Ian Paisley's Ten Best List, what with Kathy Burke's psychotic ""Bloody"" Mary burning Protestants and threatening to do the same to her half-sister and John Gielgud's Pope (earning fifth billing for barely two minutes' screen time) despatching Daniel Craig's priest to assassinate the Protestant queen not merely with his blessing but his promises of a welcome in heaven for any who help in the task. Not entirely inaccurate considering the many attempts by Catholic kingdoms like France and Spain to topple or assassinate Elizabeth during her reign, but a little more historical context might have been helpful for viewers not so familiar with Tudor politics and the causes and effects of the Reformation. It doesn't help that Michael Hirst's screenplay refers to Marie de Guise (Ardant) as Mary, Queen of Scots, leading some to assume she's THE famous Mary, Queen of Scots rather than her mother, but then the problem of just how much historical information you can include before it gets in the way of the drama is always a difficult one in a period film: too little and you don't know what's happening, too much and you feel like you should be taking notes in case there's a test later. Instead, this is content to follow Elizabeth's rise at the expense not just of her enemies but also some of her early friendships, keeping it personal even as Elizabeth has to shed her own personality to create an icon a divided nation can follow. It's certainly not flawless, but it's never dull and often impressive.",1241827200,,3749,5.054927302100162

I love Tudor history, but I'm realistic enough to expect a Tudor movie to not be very historically accurate, so I went into Elizabeth with a pretty open mind, knowing that ""history"" and ""entertainment"" rarely meet in Hollywood. I'd have to say that ""Elizabeth"" does a fair job, but the movie definitely has its faults.

Blanchett performs wonderfully as Elizabeth and seems made for the role. I would have preferred that Elizabeth be portrayed as more composed and less nervous, which would be both historically accurate and equally entertaining to me, but I suppose that the filmmakers wanted Blanchett's nervous performance to reflect Elizabeth's inner turmoil. I'm sure it is very difficult to play a calm persona whilst conveying inner uncertainty.

Similar complaints abound for Elizabeth's indiscretion in scenes where she openly sleeps with Dudley while her ladies-in-waiting watch nearby - I would venture to guess that the whole scene is supposed to be Hollywood-shorthand for their unrequited love, but the ridiculousness of the scene is a little jarring, and I cannot understand why the directors didn't at least introduce a little more secrecy to the scene.

The scenes where Elizabeth comes into her own with gentle barbs and quiet cajoling of her parliament are beautifully handled and are wonderful to behold. Blanchett manages to convey just the right amount of humility and control, humor and iron will to make the scene convincing. Elizabeth's concerns about marriage are conveyed clearly and distinctly, as she frets over the inevitability of losing her power, should she wed. And the scenes where Elizabeth struggles with the realities of power, with the necessities of ruthlessness and aloofness, are perfectly conveyed.

I do wish, however, that the movie had employed a little more cunning and subtlety on Elizabeth's part. Historically, she managed to play several suitors on a string while she quietly built her country's defenses and earned her right to independence, yet this subtlety is not conveyed here. Regularly and loudly, she protests that she will never marry, and we see almost nothing of the Spanish suitor whose armada would fare so badly and so infamously against Elizabeth's navy. I was disappointed that none of this came across.

Overall, this is a decent movie, entertaining enough and with enough kind-of-historical merit to be pleasant to Tudor lovers. I probably wouldn't watch this movie again, though, outside of a one time rental.

Oddly, the movie information on the Amazon page lists that English subtitles are included, but the version I received from Blockbuster Online did *not* have English captions for the hard of hearing, only French and Spanish subtitles, so caveat emptor.

1022480,4,6305358591,"And Elizabeth did whisper Robert Dudley's name on her deathbed... The movie is an imaginative interpretation of the way that things could have been...

Shekhar Kapur's film explores the instabilities of her reign, and the absolute horror and terror that surrounded the early part of her royal office without neglecting her relationship with her terminally ill sister... So it's a glimpse of her girlhood into statehood, and the shedding that occurs, with the people who expended in her life along the way...

The film shows Elizabeth growing up in an incredibly unstable, tumultuous environment... But she's an absolute survivor... Someone who has got no solid ground on which she walks... So one minute she's a bastard, the next minute she's a princess, then one moment she's an illegitimate daughter, then she's a queen... And it's a very relevant period of her life, because she was 25 when she became a female monarch...

There are four men in Elizabeth's life and all have quite different influences on what it means for a young woman to run the country so young, given that she comes to the throne under very difficult political circumstances...

There's Sir Cecil (Attenborough) who's from an older regime giving her the traditions and the conventions that are the most orthodox; Sir Francis (Geoffrey Rush) Elizabeth's great spy master, very astute, almost puritanical and rather dry bureaucrat; Robert Dudley (Fiennes) with whom the film suggests that she has quite a passionate, private relationship; and Norfolk (Eccleston), a major rival who doesn't regard that she is suitable to rule his England...

Watching it, I almost thought that Cate is actually Queen Elizabeth, and not portraying the role of queen Elizabeth.  However, I suggest that if you want to follow Queen Elizabeth's birth and rise to her status as queen, then I recommend the following purchases to compliment this GREAT movie.  First,  ""The Other Boleyn Girl""  which depicts Elizabeth's birth and the beheading of her mother, whom wanted to sleep with her brother (Elizabeth's uncle) in the hopes of producing a baby boy to replace the infant son she miscarried for her husband, the King of England.  Secondly, ""Elizabeth"" which begins with Elizabeth as a young girl whom loves to dance with her friend Robert.  However, when she becomes queen after an attempt to execute her for her religious beliefs, she falls in love with Robert whom beds her often.  The only problem is that Robert is married and Queen Elizabeth is unaware of his marriage to another until told by her trusted advisor.  He tells her because the powers-that-be, during that time, wanted Elizabeth to marry and produce an heir, but she considered herself married to England and was called ""The Virgin Queen.""  View the movie to see how this queen reigns supreme with her God, her love for her people and England. Finally, you can purchase ""Elizabeth, The Golden Age"" to see how Queen Elizabeth is besieged.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Other-Boleyn-Girl-ASIN-B000ZOXDFA-Elizabeth-The-Golden-Age-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B0012QE4Q2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Other Boleyn  Girl]  ][[ASIN:B000ZOXDFA Elizabeth  - The Golden Age (Widescreen Edition)</a>",1220659200,,1736,5.626923076923077
1022486,5,6305358591,"Our fascination with British history continues as we watched Elizabeth and the gorgeous sequel, Elizabeth the Golden Years. Elizabeth I lived from September 7th, 1533 until March 24th, 1603. She was called ""The Virgin Queen"" and was the fifth and last person to reign from the Tudor dynasty.

She was the daughter of Henry VIII, born to Anne Boleyn, who reigned for a short period of time as Queen but was executed when Elizabeth was at the early age of three years old. As a result of her mother's history, Elizabeth was considered an illegitimate heir to the throne. Elizabeth is sent to London Tower under suspicion of supporting rebels of the Protestant faith, but she never confesses to the accusations that placed her there, and when Mary, her half sister dies, Elizabeth is crowned queen, supported by her Protestant subjects but despised by Catholics.

The movie demonstrates how Elizabeth, masterfully played by Cate Blanchett, surrounds herself with great counsel and trusted advisers, among them William Cecil, the Baron of Burghley. One of the first acts as queen is to establish the English Protestant church and she becomes its Supreme leader. From the outset of her reign there is great pressure for Elizabeth to marry and produce an heir to the throne, but for many reasons you shall witness while watching the movie, she never marries and hence, she is known as the Virgin Queen. Thanks to the superbly loyal aide Walsingham, played in grand style by Geoffrey Rush, Elizabeth is able to uncover every plot to destroy her reign and she is able to check mate all attempts against her.

1022563,2,6305358591,"It's one thing to amuse yourself imagining how ""Romeo & Juliet"" might have come to be written for a film like ""Shakespeare in Love"" - it's another thing entirely simply to rewrite existing history so you can turn that history into a palatable soap opera for morons.

Despite a lush production, great costumes, and a cast that is nothing short of extraordinary, the liberties taken with recorded history by the director take this film down to the level of a cartoon of Elizabeth's achievements during Britain's Golden Age.  Had I seen this in the theater, I would probably have gotten up and walked out after seeing Mary de Guise murdered in her bed by Sir Francis Walsingham for the sake of ""compressing"" history and the personae of Mary de Guise and her daughter, Mary Queen of Scots.  Mary de Guise was deposed by her own nobles in 1559, and died of dropsy in 1560 - she represented next to no threat to Elizabeth (quite the reverse: the rise of Scottish Protestantism was a threat to Mary de Guise). Her daughter Mary Queen of Scots was beheaded by Elizabeth many years later after quite a long time spent imprisoned in the Tower.  Only the presence of actors like Blanchett, Rush, and Eccleston kept me watching. Then there was the presentation of the young Elizabeth as wavering and tentative and easily cowed, when in fact one of the factors in her survival of a very dangerous youth was her composure, brilliant mind, and oratorical gifts; and, most absurdly, a wildly erotic sex scene between Fiennes and Blanchett in an open space where her ladies in waiting (and anyone else who cared to) enjoyed the spectacle, a piece of recklessness so out of character for the wily, man-dodging Elizabeth that it beggars description.

I was the more disgusted because, knowing how appallingly badly educated Americans are when it comes to history (more than half of teens polled recently couldn't give the dates of the Civil War), I am sure three quarters of the audiences in this country walked out thinking that they had just been shown the truth.

There is NO excuse for this.  NONE.  I see from the ecstatic reviews that most people either don't know any better or worse, just don't care - it is a sad commentary on their standards.  I wonder if the director had a good time trying to cut down to size one of history's greatest female leaders?

For the record, Blanchett is splendid as the young Elizabeth, Joseph Fiennes decent but uninspiring (as he always seems to be) as the feckless Sir Robert Dudley, Geoffrey Rush amazing (as HE always seems to be) as the canny Walsingham, and Christopher Eccleston baleful and forbidding as the Catholic Duke of Norfolk, sworn to bring down what he considers a heretic and illegitimate Queen (the Norfolks still lead England's minority Catholic nobility).  Daniel Craig has a small role in this film as one of Norfolk's co-conspirators in treason - as always, Craig is compelling to watch even briefly.  I find Joseph Fiennes so dull; what a pity neither Craig nor Eccleston were cast as Dudley.

But what a stunning waste of immense talent on a script that is absolute trash.",1203033600,7,3119,4.743068391866913

The movie itself is beautifully shot, the screenplay rich and informative, while being highly entertaining. Its dramatic and romantic and nail biting all at once. I love watching period films/costume dramas; whatever you wanna call it, this one is up there as one of the best made. Hands down, no question.

Cinematography, soundtrack, script and cast are second to none. For me what raises its standard of excellence even higher, if that were possible, is the symbolic connection made between Queen Elizabeth and the Virgin Mary, hence the unofficial title ""the Virgin Queen).

Religion and personal convictions always seem to be at odds with politics and personal ambitions particularly in period pieces involving royalty and the belief in the right to rule as though by Divine Decree. This beautiful intermixing of the mundane with sacred is the cord that binds this film together adding depth and dimension to an already stellar production.

Although historically inaccurate, Kapur's Elizabeth is a masterpiece of cinematography.  Cate Blanchett, a virtual unknown when she was cast for the role, couldn't have been a better choice for the role of this ageless monarch.

The film covers approximately five years of Elizabeth's reign, from her life as a Princess, to her ascendancy to the throne on 17 November 1558 to her maturing as a monarch, taking the reigns of power from advisors.  Again, ignoring the fact that some events in the film are not accurate (Kapur explains this in the bonus features), Elizabeth is a fantastic portrayal of the Tudor dynasty that died with Elizabeth I.  Joseph Fiennes was the perfect choice for the Earl of Leicester (whom Elizabeth called ""My Eyes""), as Fiennes is a well known Shakespearean actor, who portrayed Shakespeare the same year Elizabeth came out in ""Shakespeare in Love"".

Great cast, including Geoffrey Rush and Sir Richard Attenborough, Elizabeth is a feast of photography, words, history and acting.  I highly recommend this film, and am looking forward to Elizabeth: The Golden Age.",1200700800,11,1251,5.102941176470588

1022610,4,6305358591,"Partially reinventing the period movie, stylistically at least, almost as radically as Martin Scorsese reinvented the Biblical epic with his Last Temptation, Shekhur Kapur's account of the insecure early days of Elizabeth I's reign, Elizabeth, is a claustrophobic film set in a dark world of cold grey stone, alternating overhead shots with tight medium shots rather than stressing spectacle or glamour, more political thriller than costume epic. Indeed, with its bloody finale clearly inspired by The Godfather as Walsingham takes care of business for his Capo di tutti Capo, it's almost a mafia movie, with Cate Blanchett's star-making turn as Elizabeth filling in the Michael Corleone role as the heir apparent who must ruthlessly shed emotions and conscience to hold on to the throne. That journey from fresh-faced youth to impregnable white-faced icon gives the film a solid emotional arc that helps prevent it from becoming a simple series of confrontations and thwarted conspiracies, almost - but not quite - turning it into a tragedy of success rather than the usual tragedy of failure that is usually the lot of women in historical pictures (Anne of the Thousand Days, Mary Queen of Scots, Lady Jane, La Reine Margot, etc).

It's handsomely cast: Joseph Fiennes gives good shallow romanticism as Elizabeth's lover Dudley, Christopher Eccleston in his default misery guts mode makes a fine villain and there's a healthy cast that, if not bursting with A-listers, is at least filled with familiar faces, from Richard Attenborough, Fanny Ardant, Daniel Craig and Vincent Cassel in a dress to Edward Hardwicke, Kelly McDonald, James Frain, Emily Mortimer and Eric Cantona. Yet perhaps even more than Blanchett it's a magnificent Geoffrey Rush who often dominates the film from the sidelines as the Queen's loyal and utterly unscrupulous spymaster Sir Francis Walsingham, a man who can seem all things to all men and women but is loyal only to her. Even when he's simply observing from afar he's a powerful presence in all the right ways, emanating a callous intelligence that is truly frightening.

It's strange that the sequel has been attacked by the Vatican as anti-Catholic when this first chapter probably occupies a high place on Ian Paisley's Ten Best List, what with Kathy Burke's psychotic ""Bloody"" Mary burning Protestants and threatening to do the same to her half-sister and John Gielgud's Pope (earning fifth billing for barely two minutes' screen time) despatching Daniel Craig's priest to assassinate the Protestant queen not merely with his blessing but his promises of a welcome in heaven for any who help in the task. Not entirely inaccurate considering the many attempts by Catholic kingdoms like France and Spain to topple or assassinate Elizabeth during her reign, but a little more historical context might have been helpful for viewers not so familiar with Tudor politics and the causes and effects of the Reformation. It doesn't help that Michael Hirst's screenplay refers to Marie de Guise (Ardant) as Mary, Queen of Scots, leading some to assume she's [I]the[/I] famous Mary, Queen of Scots rather than her mother, but then the problem of just how much historical information you can include before it gets in the way of the drama is always a difficult one in a period film: too little and you don't know what's happening, too much and you feel like you should be taking notes in case there's a test later. Instead, this is content to follow Elizabeth's rise at the expense not just of her enemies but also some of her early friendships, keeping it personal even as Elizabeth has to shed her own personality to create an icon a divided nation can follow. It's certainly not flawless, but it's never dull and often impressive.",1197763200,2,3756,5.066235864297254

Elizabeth ascends the throne upon the death of her half-sister Catholic Mary (who had done everything that she possibly could to prevent the Protestant Elizabeth from becoming the monarch).

1022614,5,6305358591,"ELIZABETH is and was my introduction to director Shekhar Kapur.  Boy, can this guy make a movie. Film is a medium that works via visuals, and Kapur delivers sensational vistas, landscapes, settings, and angles.  There's a look and a feel of quality aesthetics in this film, which makes watching it a visually-enhancing experience.

As Kapur in the special features readily admits, this is a speculative account of the early reign of Queen Elizabeth (Cate Blanchett).  Her ascension certainly came at a most turbulent time; she succeeded her very Catholic sister, ""Bloody Mary,"" whose persecution of Protestant ""heretics"" was tearing Britain apart.  (In fact, the film opens with a disturbing scene depicting three ""heretics"" being burned alive at the stake; quite the ""hook"" to get the viewer to pay attention.)  The young queen is in dangerous waters, and turns to two men for help.  One of them, Sir William Cecil (played solidly by Sir Richard Attenborough), has consistent advice:  Get married, produce an heir.  The other advisor, Sir Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush is sensational in this brooding, almost sinister role) is a bit more practical:  Do whatever it takes to keep Elizabeth in power.

To top it all off, there is the matter of Elizabeth's lover (although not proven historical fact), Robert Dudley.  Played by an almost-dainty Joseph Fiennes, it becomes readily apparent young Robert will not be strong enough to handle a queen growing steadily more powerful and independent.  Dudley's outcome is one of the more predictable plot lines of the film.

And as we watch, we see the young Elizabeth become hardened, more cynical; we see her forfeit her own personal life in exchange for a persona--an icon around whom her people can rally.  All of this is done through the exquisite professionalism of Cate Blanchett, who much deserved her Academy Award nomination.

Other surprises in this film include a stunning Fanny Ardant, who plays Elizabeth's rival, Mary of Guise; and then there's the new James Bond, Daniel Craig, who plays a somewhat overzealous priest.  The special features pale in comparison to the movie, but come on, the movie is where the rubber meets the road.  ELIZABETH is a gripping, compelling, artistic period piece--a cinematic feast as rich as it is engrossing.  Sign me up as a Shekhar Kapur fan.

Cate Blanchett does a superb performance portraying Queen Elizabeth I. Strong in character, tender in the heart, she experienced life as most HRH's ""did not dare"" for the time period. She stood firm in her convictions as remaining a Protestant in ascending the throne, inspite of her sister's desire that she convert to Catholicism in a day when freedom of religion was still a concept. To have a sexual affair prior while on the throne for a queen was just unheard of. Blanchett poured every emotion she had into this character bringing a convincing life to the film.",1192579200,,703,5.901960784313726

To me the deffinitive portraits on video were done with Glenda Jackson back in the early 1970s on BBC.  The acting and attention to detail were supurb.  Compared to that a movie like this comes off second or third place.

This film suffers from being over done.  While Cate Blanchatte is fetching, she alone is not enough to carry a very heavy-handed production.  Because of the number of events that are being condensed into a two hour production the end result is the usual montage of MTV like images that flash onto the screen.  This seems to be a popular filming techneque now.  Flood the viewer with a collage of images all at once so they can't think about the actual content of the film.  Add to that over-powering music, much of not period I might add, and you complete the current package for today.  A confused mess!  Add to this that many if the actors look and act too comtemporary.  We have not even gott'en into the historical inaccuracies yet!  They are many and have been covered by other reviewers.  I would also say that the murder of Mary of Guise is wrong, and the use of Norfolk to represent all the evil Catholics in England at the time is over-simplification. The actor who plays him is terrible.  He is like some punk rocker stuffed into tights!

The film has many other problems but I shall not list them.  I think the problem lies with the East Indian producer/director who does not know how to handle English history.

The recent addition Elizabeth, The Golden Age that just came out suffers from many of the same issues above, but the storyline and events are presented in somewhat clearer fashion.  It would be nice if historical epics today tried to focus more on the actual events they are portraying rather than on special effects and over the top screen writing.",1192406400,,1873,4.587349397590361

Any time I review an historical film,I first of all consider  crucial thoughts,which are ""did I enjoy the film,the screenplay,the acting,the music,the camerawork etc? And ultimately,""did the film move along?"" The answer is a RESOUNDING YES to Kapur's film. Is it historically accurate?....ehh!...somewhat yes,a lot maybe,some definitely not;BUT I am rating a film,not history. Wikipedia has loads of information on all of the characters and events in this film for anyone to learn more. I will say this,that no version of The Virgin Queen's life is 100% accurate simply because not everything is known for certain involving many of the ""players"" in Elizabeth Tudor's Reign. So, those that like Helen Mirren,good. If you prefer Glenda Jackson's performance, magnificent. If you need historical accuracy,you best not see any of them!!! As a film, though,this ELIZABETH for style and substance,is my favorite. Cate Blanchett and the entire ensemble is first class. I was surprised to see Daniel Craig as the murderous priest. Boy, has he gone on to great success since killing off Kelly MacDonald!

1022685,5,6305358591,"1998's ""Elizabeth"" is an excellent dramatization of the early years of Queen Elizabeth I of England.  A young and naive Elizabeth (superbly played by Cate Blanchett) came to the throne in a time of religious war, national rivalry, and cutthroat politics.  Aided by the sound advice of her advisors and guided by her own intelligence and instincts, she survives a series of threats to her throne and to England to become the legendary Virgin Queen.

The story opens as ""Bloody Mary"", Catholic Queen of England and barren wife of King Philip of Spain, lies dying.  The throne passes to her  Protestant half-sister, Elizabeth, who is taken in hand by her courtiers, most notably the experienced Sir William Cecil (played with an attractive mixture of patience and urgency by Richard Attenborough).  Elizabeth is immediately faced with complicated responsibilities as queen, not least of which her need to balance her love for the Earl of Leicester (Joseph Fiennes) against the demand of her advisors that she marry a suitable royal to build alliances for England.

Elizabeth quickly learns to make her own decisions in walking a narrow line between contending religious and political factions with the aid of her intelligence master, Sir Francis Walsingham (played with pitch-perfect sinster aspect by Geoffrey Rush).  The supreme challenge to her throne comes from the ambitious and powerful Duke of Norfolk (Christopher Eccleston), who makes alliances with both friend and enemy in a plot to overturn Elizabeth. To survive, Elizabeth must demonstrate that she has mastered the lessons of power.

This movie is well-casted, superbly staged, reasonably faithful to the historical record, and features Cate Blanchett in her first real starring role.  It is highly recommended to fans of historical dramas and to fans of the Elizabeathan era.",1191715200,,1837,5.260273972602739

During scenes of Mary Tudor's reign everything is ugly and dark. The rooms are lit with ugly short stumpy candles, the furniture is nasty. As soon as Liza comes to the throne she gets much nicer rooms to live in. All natural sunlight comes in from the ceiling, white pillars and beautiful ""marble?"" floors appear. Liza must have redecorated extensively. This is not Tudor architecture.
I loved this movie but I wish Directors would read books. They also portray her wearing that hard white makeup in her twenties which no portrait of her at that age can verify. She didn't do that. She didn't wear wigs presumably until about the age of forty. Grey hair or whatever prompted this change. The actor cast as Dudley looks nothing like him but Kate is the image of Elizabeth. I guess they thought the real Dudley wasn't cutey studly enough. They have a ridiculous scene of a lady in waiting dying of poisoning after trying on a dress. What? When is this recorded?",1191369600,,1282,4.506437768240343
1022687,5,6305358591,"Never knew much about Elizabeth and just judging by the portraits of her that I saw on my tour through London, I thought of her as some boring, dry queen with no motives behind anything but self glorification. Thanks to this film, Elizabeth is revealed to me in a whole different way. She's a girl with a broken heart, a survival, a murceful queen, honest and devoted to England! I was quiet amazed by  Cate Blanchett's performance. In every movement she made, in every word she spoke, she was as believable as could possibly ever be. The story of Elizabeth's life and her battle against evil within her country as well as from out of borders of England lays out so beautifully by Cate's performance as well as the writers and directors that it was hard to take eyes off of the screen. A history, a legend, and a mystery of the queen Elezabeth won over my heart as I watched the movie. I wish I could write more, but it's hard to put in words something that comes in your life unexpactedly and amazes you with its richness of wonder and fantastic beauty! I recommand this movie for any lover of powerful movies that have mystery, love, darkness, beauty and magic of destiny mixed all together!

On the other hand, the new Universal DVD has much more vivid color and a brighter look overall. The soft focus remains, but it is still much more detailed than the Polygram version, and only occasionally seems over-enhanced.

The video image is not perfect in the Universal DVD, but I prefer it to the image of the Polygram DVD. The price of the new Universal DVD is certainly an advantage, because the original list price of the Polygram DVD was $34.95.",1190332800,,639,4.696428571428571

I've become a huge fan of the Showtime show *The Tudors* and it has made me return to my love of history in that I've sought out gaps in my knowledge in media form.  I never saw this movie when it first came out and now I can truly appreciate it because of The Tudors show on Showtime.

I caught this movie on HBO recently and I was thrilled because it filled me in on what the Showtime series will eventually get to.  It focuses on the reign of Elizabeth I, the illegitimate daughter of King Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn.

It shows what Elizabeth endured as an outcast, after her father's death and during her 1/2 sister Mary's reign and subsequent death.  Mary was the daughter of Katherine of Aragon and Henry VIII and she never let Elizabeth forget that she was *the bastard child*.  She had her arrested and locked up in the Tower of London.  She was lucky she wasn't killed.  When Mary gets sick and eventually dies from cancer, the throne is turned over to Elizabeth as she is next in line, and catholicism in England dies.  Thus the start of the Church of England as Elizabeth is Protestant due to the connivings of her mother, Anne Boleyn.

The movie also shows, fascinatingly I might add, that Elizabeth was considered the Virgin Queen as she never married, never wanted to due to her father's philandering ways, and died unmarried and childless.  Because of this, the Tudor's line died with her and that was the end of that.  In came the Stewarts [I think].  Anyway, her reign was considered ""The Golden Era"" and she was one of the most beloved Queens in the history of the monarchy.

Cate Blanchette does an astounding job in this movie.  It is great!",1189555200,,1703,4.4627831715210355

Unfortunately, however, since the Oscars are nothing more than a popularity contest, and because Gwyneth Paltrow was so popular at that time, she won.

1022766,4,6305358591,"Elizabeth is a beautifully shot film directed by Shekhar Kapur.  The cast was a whose who of future stars and past cinema giants.  The cast includes Geoffrey Rush, Christopher Eccleston, Kelly MacDonald, Daniel Craig, Vincent Cassel, Emily Mortimer, Richard Attenborough, Fanny Ardant, Joseph Fiennes and of course Cate Blanchett.  It is screen legend John Gielgud's final picture before his death at the age of 96 and he gets to play the Pope.  English pop singer Lily Allen also appears in a small role when she was just 12 years old.  The film portrays the early part of the reign of Queen Elizabeth I of England.  She is the bastard child of King Henry VIII and Anne Bolyn, and was queen for 45 years starting in 1558 and until her death.  The period she ruled was often regarded as the most significant period of growth in England's past.  Her legacy is a positive one and she is often recognized as the most highly regarded British monarch in history.

The film follows how Elizabeth became queen after Mary I of England's death.  It deals with many issues regarding the fact that she is Protestant and was imprisoned for allegations that she planned to assassinate Queen Mary I.  She is released when Mary I dies and Elizabeth becomes queen.  Many conspire against her, from Catholics to the Scots and the French.  It also follows Elizabeth's love affair with Robert Dudley (Joseph Fiennes).  The film ends fittingly with Elizabeth's reign entering stability just before the beginning of the English Renaissance.  I say fittingly because a sequel to Elizabeth is being released this fall and it will no doubt exhibit the true nature of Elizabeth's legacy and the reverence held toward her to this day.  It covers a more interesting period in my opinion.

I actually had a problem with the concept of this film.  The nature of this period in Elizabeth's life didn't sit well with me in terms of transferring to a motion picture.  The way liberties are taken with historical facts inject drama effectively and actually makes up for what should've been a fairly anti-climactic story.  So her life becomes a bit of soap opera.  Part of me thinks that if the film was pure history it still could've been good but perhaps not has marketable.  I found it enjoyable either way.  The sets and costumes are incredible and the cinematography is also worth praising.  The real strength in Elizabeth is Cate Blanchett.  She is the best actress of this generation and is amazing here.  This may not seem like a timely review (it's about eight years overdue) but with the sequel coming out I recommend seeing Elizabeth.  The sequel has Samantha Morton as Elizabeth's antagonist Mary, Queen of Scots and Clive Owen as Walter Raleigh.  No doubt its release for the fall is setting it up for some major awards.",1183939200,6,2799,4.78705636743215

It, however, is a historical piece, and as one that would be so widely viewed, they should have used less 'artistic license' for what was already a fascinating period.

Kate Blanchett is a decent Elizabeth, but can not even come close to Glenda Jackson's spellbinding portrayal. Geoffrey Rush as Walshingham is good, but exaggerated.

1022853,3,6305358591,"This movie is beautifully staged and filmed and very well acted. Historically, it is no where near the truth. The problems are... well.... endless, but I will only mention two or three:

1) Elizabeth knows that Robert Dudley is married long before she comes to the throne. The crisis in their relationship comes early in her reign when Dudley's wife dies under mysterious circumstances. Although the death is ruled an accident, many still suspect Dudley (and Elizabeth). This is the main event that effectively prevents them from ever marrying. The fact that almost nobody liked Dudley (except, it seems, Elizabeth) is another.

2) Sir William Cecil is older than Elizabeth but only 12 or so years.  He's not her grandfather's age - as Richard Attenborough looks. Cecil becomes Lord Burghley as a result of Elizabeth's favor, but the movie says she rewards him for his service - as she removes him from office. In reality, she never let him retire from her service, much as he begged as he grew old and infirm.

3) Cat Ashley, Elizabeth's companion and friend, was in fact much older than Elizabeth, not of the same age group as this movie shows. Cat was Elizabeth's governess from a young age, and acted as her mother figure.

Sometimes the plot gets so thick it's hard to follow the story. And with a cast of so many characters it's easy to forget who's being talked about and where their allegiences lie.

1022856,5,6305358591,"Elizabeth the person was great, and so is Elizabeth the movie. It is a highly romanticized adaptation of Elizabeth I's turbulent life.  she went from being sentenced to death at the infamous London Tower, to being England's strongest female monarch in history.
The movie opens with scary shots of people being burned to death by Queen Mary I, also known in history as Bloody Mary. A devoted catholic, there was one thing Mary hated more than protestants, and that was her  half-sister Elizabeth, who not only was a protestant, but also a threat to strip the childless Mary of her title. Elizabeth is therefore imprisoned, but suddenly dies, which makes Elizabeth the queen. We are soon invited to see what really happens among royalty, as Elizabeth deals with the questions of marriage, love, war, conspiracies and power.
The movie has two stellar qualities. The first one is Kate Blanchett, who plays the title character with ease and skill. Instead of expressing her emotions only through her voice, she takes advantage of her body language - the way Elizabeth walks and dances is never the same, and sometimes all Blanchett needs to do is move her hand in order to express a sentiment. The second big thing about this movie is the direction. The director, Shekhar Kaphur, not only wisely exploits all Blanchett has to offer, he decides not to change the pace of the movie by adding more action or drama. Instead, he sticks with dialogue which is more than enough - the scenes where Elizabeth defends herself from the accusations and the preconceptions of her councilors are exciting and dramatic, despite their minimalistic concept. Also, the texture, color palette and composition are important aspects of the movie - the setting, color scheme, costuming and light always reflect the feelings Elizabeth is hiding behind her pale faade.
""Elizabeth"" is undeniably a masterpiece. However, it will not appeal to everybody - some will find the subject uninteresting, or its pace monotonous. People who decide to truly follow it, think about it and enjoy it, though, will find the stellar cast (including the ever-watchable co-stars Geoffrey Rush, Joseph Fiennes, Vincent Cassel and Daniel Craig), fantastic crew and the wonderful English feel to it make this movie a royal treat, something to indulge in again and again.",1171152000,3,2319,5.036458333333333

On those points he got it right ALTHOUGH people were not quite as clean and good looking then. Times were brutal. A toothache could kill you. Lice were everywhere.

Those who criticize on historical accuracy complaints miss the point. An historically accurate film would span very very many hours or even more.

The movie probably could have been a little longer as it is. Worthy of multiple viewings.

Geoffrey Rush in a standout performance as Sir Francis Walsingham, Elizabeth's shadowy, street smart but patriotic ally who moves mountains for her with extreme ruthlessness from behind curtains. His performance alone makes this worth viewing.",1160956800,5,946,5.2105263157894735

The actors playing Elizabeth, Cecil, and Walsingham spoke and acted admirably, each phrase spoken with such honesty and feeling, but the words themselves rendered the performances useless. The director and the author of the script greatly misunderstood the characters and the material. They should have read Elizabeth the First's biography by Elizabeth Jenkins. It is useless to say a movie does not need to be historically accurate but has only to entertain: had the author and director been more historically accurate, they would not have created the unbelievable character they created in Elizabeth, who is in turn hysterical, defeatist, overbearing, childish, tyrannical, who never shows her core intelligence, her great love of her people, who had a private core described by her motto ""Semper Eadem"", be always one. Elizabeth ruled with her advisors, she was not totally ruled by them. She would not have put up with Norfolk screaming at her across the council table, nor would Burleigh have allowed it. Cate Blanchett's wonderful acting and presence were pearls thrown before swine, wasted on a character portrayal that totally lacked any integrity, much less truth. How could the director think that the woman he portrayed was any kind of real woman? The ending had me blushing with embarassment for one and all. We are laughably given William Cecil as wimpy and ineffective, and Walsingham as the mastermind behind the throne. One of the reviews said that the director inspired Rush to play Walsingham much like the Hindu god Krishna.

Over-zealous and fanatic (as was a common religious stance in those times - promoted by both sides of the Protestant/Catholic conflict), she was not insane as the film makes her in the opening scenes.  And throughout the film, there was this emphasis on milking the passions for all they are worth - no objectivity whatsoever.  I was sorely disappointed!

If you want to get to know Elizabeth and the period in which she lived, I would recommend the superb BBC series, Elizabeth R with Glenda Jackson.  And if you want even further background, look to the BBC again in the Six Wives of Henry VIII with Keith Mitchell.  Tidbits can be gained as well from the movie Mary, Queen of Scots (although a few historical inaccuracies can be found in it - for example, Mary Stuart and Elizabeth never met, although it was Mary's great desire) and even another title, Anne of the Thousand Days.  Those two more theatrical representations fulfill the desire for the more dramatic while still coming closer to the history of the times.

1022945,3,6305358591,"Lush, well produced, beautfully filmed, visually appealing, well-acted, all of these describe ""Elizabeth.""  ""Historical"" however, does not.  I am very surprised at the number of people here who claim to be lovers of British history who praised the film for its accurate depiction of events.  Elizabeth could certainly play the fragile, indecisive maid when she needed to do so, but fragile and uncertain she was not-- she learned hard politics from a real master, her father, Henry VIII.
Certainly fond of Lord Dudley, there is no evidence they ever had a sexual relationship.  The sorry truth is, if Good Queen Bess ever had a sexual relationship it was with her abusive guardian, the husband of Queen Catherine (Parr).  Elizabeth and Anjou never met, in England or elsewhere (she did later meet his brother, who came closer than other man to marrying her but of course did not succeed).
The clothing and hair styles, while deserving of notice, are largely inaccurate, in some cases, Edwardian more than Elizabethan. This is somewhat surprising given the rich and accurate store of knowledge regarding the couterie of the period.
There are numerous other points to make, but simply know this:
This is a work of fiction, based on certain historical figures and a few historical events.  Watch the film and appreciate the fine acting, the beautiful settings and costumes, and the intensity and passion of the characters (who really were that proud, that devoted, and that ready to die for their various causes), but do not learn history from it.  Hopefully you'll be intrigued enough to find a few good books to read and learn of it yourself-- you may be surprised that the real stories are even more arresting.
History takes place over periods of years, decades, and longer, and even significant events that unfold quickly can be awfully hard to condense into a 2 hour movie, so faulting them for inaccuracies serves little purpose; audiences should however be better trained to recognize fiction and enjoy it but not necessarily learn historical facts from it.  Rather, learn about the human condition from fiction, which is the greatest purpose it serves.",1147219200,9,2157,5.022408963585434
1022946,5,6305358591,"I first noticed ""Elizabeth"" during the Academy Awards for 1998.  I believe ""Shakespeare in Love"" was a big hit that year and I passed them both off as costume dramas.  I watched ""Elizabeth"" last night and discovered that this is NOT your traditional costume drama.  It is, at times, a dark look at the intrigue of royal politics while, at other times, a bright view of a young lady coming of age in a variety of ways.  The intrigue is well-presented.  We don't always know exactly what's going on but, then, why should we be any different from the participants.  There is enough blood and guts to suggest a warning for those in search of a romantic movie.  Yet this is blood and guts with a purpose.  This is England in the midst of one of its' greatest crisies and we are reminded that, with the stakes so high, the ruthlessness rose as well.  Much of the history of the early reign of Elizabeth was new to me and I'm sorry to say that.  We know of how she led England to its' greatest level of power but I certainly wasn't aware that it all got off to such a fascinatingly fragile beginning.  I took a moment to check my old English History textbook (Willson) and found enough brief mentions of characters and events to let me know that this is a biographical movie based in fact.  I won't elaborate but you will probably come to the same conclusion as I did that there were a number of poetic licenses issued in the making of ""Elizabeth"".  I was enthralled with the way this lesser known history was presented.

The subject, of course, is in the movie's title and it is the development of this young lady that is its' crowning (sorry) achievement.  Elizabeth discovers that, when you can trust no one else, you have to learn to trust yourself.  This development in her is brought out in a convincing series of personal glimpses and events.  I kept hoping that this was actually a three or four hour movie because I realized time was running out and I wanted to watch this development continue much further.  In the end, the writer and director gave us just what we needed to realize that Elizabeth had reached the level of maturity and self-confidence that would take her into the realm of greatness.  The rest, as they say, is history and one that I was pretty comfortable with.  Regardless of the accuracy of every detail in the movie, ""Elizabeth"" gave me a greater appreciation of just who England's greatest queen really was.

I visited Hatfield House in the UK and this is where Elizabeth spent her years of house arrest until the death of her sister, Mary. So I felt an affinity with 'The Virgin Queen' when this came out.

Cate Blanchett is outstanding as Elizabeth. The whole movie is superb in its depiction of Elizabethan times and medieval culture.

Christopher Eccleston, now better known as the Ninth Doctor Who gives a great performance as the Duke of Norfolk.

And how can you not love Geoffrey Rush's Walsingham? He steals the show.

Edward Burke has a minor role. Good to see him after Jeremy Brett's sad, sad demise. I still miss the duo in the Sherlock Holmes mysteries.

This is, quite simply a MUST SEE if you like a) history, b) GOOD movies or c) enjoy Cate, Christopher or Geoffrey Rush. I think I have worn out my DVD by now.

1022950,2,6305358591,"Elizabeth purports to cover the several years in the life of Elizabeth, during the reign of Queen Mary I and five years into her own reign (according to the end of the film before the credits). Staring Cate Blanchett, Joseph Fiennes, Geofrey Rush, Richard Attenborough and an excellent supporting cast (did Emily Mortimer say a word? I was hoping she had speaking lines).

From the beginning it becomes clear this film does not know whether it wants to be a great tragic romance, a political thriller or a history. It does none of them very well. The screenplay, written by Michael Hirst, is a hodge podge of scenes touching on famous points in Elizabeth's early history with little sense of a time line. Perhaps Mr. Hirst was presuming viewers would already be familiar with Elizabeth Tudor to know that years were passing rather than a few months or days. It goes for broke with the Elizabeth/Dudley romance, having them wind up in bed once she's crowned (right on, I say, the only thing I truly liked in this film) and intimating a regular intimate relationship between the two.

The historical inaccuracies are so glaring they make the film almost unwatchable in and of themselves. Elizabeth is protrayed as a politically naive child (which she was not according to historians). The proposed marriage between Dudley and Mary Queen of Scots never makes an appearance (in fact neither does Mary Queen of Scots; perhaps Mary of Guise was supposed to suffice for both women?). William Cecil was created Baron Burghley in the film within five years of Elizabeth's ascension but that did not occur until 1571 in reality. The courtship of Francois, Duke of Anjou and Elizabeth did not occur until 1572 but was wedged into the first five years, as well. The Duke of Norfolk was executed in 1572, not in the first five years of Elizabeth's reign. And so on.

The dialogue is, for the most part, unremarkable and boring. The actors do their best with what they're given and they make it sound almost plausible. But they can never make up for the fact this film doesn't know what it wants to do. It's more difficult for me to get a read on the director, Shekhar Kapur. I'm not sure if he made the best of a mediocre script or if his skill wasn't on par with the actors with which he was working. I've not seen anything else by him so cannot say. I found the unusual camera angles mildly interesting but, ultimately, they did not bring anything new or interesting to the narrative.

The settings, costumes and cinematography were interesting but hardly worth the Oscar nominations. I mean, Gone with the Wind one best color cinematography in 1939. Does Elizabeth compare? Not even close.

I love a good costume drama as much as the next person and if someone is going to diddle with history they better be very good at it to make it plausible and interesting. Honestly, what happened to the real life Elizabeth and what she caused to happen was as interesting as any scriptwriter and director could want. There was no need to change history, ignore it or condensce it.

Overall, I wanted to like this film and went into it with an open mind, looking forward to Cate Blanchetts' performance. By the end I found myself wishing Geoffrey Rush's Walsingham had been a lot nastier and more blood thirsty for the visceral release of pretending he was torturing the director and script writer.

I'm sorry to say but this movie needed a better screenwriter and a better director to realize its full potential.",1141344000,4,3492,4.705400981996727

Henry VIII has snuffed it from gout or syphilis, it depends on who you read, Bloody Mary's got a tumour and the Catholics' greatest fear is Anne Boleyn's daughter Elizabeth.  The opening scene signals the film's intent. Protestant heretics are burnt mercilessly at the grisly stake, accompanied by proclamations that they should burn in Hell. It's clear that England is in a pretty gloomy state and ruled by a humourless zealot, Mary who is hell-bent on converting or murdering Elizabeth.

One need not possess any knowledge of history to make sense of the plot and story. Like a good mystery there were subtle nuances. Glances between characters that foreshadowed events and interactions to come, such as the woman that betrays Norfolk, and the child that inadvertently reveals his father's hiding place.

There are many things that make Elizabeth a great film. For example, not only is it amazingly realistic, but it also portrays a very accurate depiction of the Queen. The difficult early part of her reign is not as well known as the stunning success that she later achieved as a leader, and her potent and strong-willed personality is captured very well in this film. She suffers through countless hardships during this part of her life, and the circumstances leading to her crowning of herself as The Virgin Queen are what make up the story of this excellent film. The visuals, particularly the breathtaking interiors of the tremendous castles in which much of the film takes place, are some of the most amazing things about this movie.

Cate Blanchett captures the authority of the noted queen perfectly, rapturing both her shy school girl resonance, then, as she is forced to either flee or fight, we see Elizabeth become the straightforward and forceful, but loyal, leader of England.

The heart of the film deals with Queen Elizabeth's most deepened period of turmoil. The Roman Catholic Church has issued a private act of aggression on the queen, one that requires a number of assassination attempts. Mary Queen of Scots is involved, as is the Duke of Norfolk (the oh-so-British actor Christopher Eccelston). Where Elizabeth lacks momentary  initiative to rid herself of these enemies, she finds it in her very aggressive and very thorough aid, Sir Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush). Even here, however, we sense that Elizabeth is entirely competent when it comes to these dealings.

Elizabeth is a film that depicts the legendary queen as more than the stoic, unflinching woman many history books have painted her as. She is a woman who is deeply in love with a man in the early portions of her leadership, and one that is quite aware of what it means to be compassionate as well as acutely just. Later, we watch this love turn to her nation.

The film is highlighted by memorable performances by Rush, Blanchett, Eccelston, and Joseph Fiennes, who plays Elizabeth's lover, Lord Robert Dudley.

The film is full of elegance and pageantry, but the storytelling is kind of weak, and hard to follow at times. But these shortcomings are made up by good performances by a unique cast. Cate Blanchett (""The Lord of the Rings"" Trilogy) gives an immensely powerful and intimate portrayal of Elizabeth I, and Christopher Eccleston (""The Others""; TV's ""Doctor Who"") is menacing as the Duke of Norfolk. The supporting cast (Which includes Joseph Fiennes, John Gielgud, Geoffrey Rush, Daniel Craig and Richard Attenborough) also give strong, solid performances.

Overall, this is a good film that takes a unique and unrelenting look at the Queen who changed the history of Britain forever.

Believe it or not, this young woman, when her life was in danger by her own sister and otherwise, was savy in politics and in what she should and shouldn't say and how she should or shouldn't act. This is not to say she was cold-hearted - she did at times let certain Earl's play with her heart-strings, but she cut them (and whoever she had to) off in order to stay the great monarch that she was...ALONE. I understand that it makes the movie more interesting to make her this vunerable ""ruling with her heart"" girl who GROWS INTO the strong Queen we've all heard about. But to be honest - she already was that smart and didn't need the help of all of those men to BECOME that way.

Other than that little complaint - the movie is utterly WONDERFUL. Her coronation scene looks like a famous painting of the Queen COME TO LIFE.

Cate Blanchett and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!

The clash between England and her adversaries (notably France, Scotland, and Spain) is as fascinating as the conflict between Protestantism and Catholicism.

1023122,3,6305358591,"While aspects of this film are gorgeous to view, including scenery, sets, costumes, the plot was confusing at times and substantially distorted actual history and historical persons to offer a Hollywood ""drama"".  Cate Blanchett did her best with the storyline as written and directed and looked much like I would expect Elizabeth to look as a young woman.  And Joseph Fiennes captured the essence of Robert Dudley as I imagine him in his youth and as he appears in a portrait painted of him as a young man.  I really object to the portrayal of Robert at the end of the film and how they showed Elizabeth as ""Gloriana"" when she was no more than 30.  While Elizabeth and Robert had a tumultuous relationship, they always came back together until his death when they were in their mid-50s and even then, Elizabeth most likely held him in her heart until her death in 1603 (as evidenced by his ""Last Letter"" kept in her treasure box by her bed).

The 1970's film, ""Mary, Queen of Scots"", more faithfully captures the true essence of Elizabeth (albeit still distorting historical fact).  The movie stars Vanessa Redgrave as Mary and Glenda Jackson as Elizabeth, who in my mind is THE Elizabeth on screen. While the film focuses on Mary and her travails, Elizabeth's story is well represented here, too.  Trever Howard as Cecil is heads above Mr. Attenborough.  And Daniel Massey as Robert Dudley ain't bad either.  And of course, there are plenty of biographies and other non-fiction books about Elizabeth, her life and times if you really want learn the ""truth"".

But ultimately, the portrayal of Elizabeth I that catches my breath, that speaks to me across the centuries is the Elizabeth of Sharon Kaye's novel, ""Legacy"".

1023124,4,6305358591,"While most DVD commentaries discuss trivial details like which camerman ate tuna for lunch and how hot it was on the day of filming, this DVD commentary actually delivers!

The director discusses the history of the queen Elizabeth as well as the choices made to tell her story in this film.  For example, the camera often spins around Cate Blanchett/Elizabeth to indicate the many conspiracies that threatened Elizabeth.

In addition, the commentary discusses moral, philosophical and historical issues, not just technical details.  For example, it discusses Elizabeth's reception of Mary's ring under a large tree, and explains that this scene was filmed from afar, since it is recorded history and putting us far away makes it feel as if we are viewing history from the present (from afar).  But when the emotional character of Elizabeth becomes important, the director moves the camera in closer.  Or that he filmed Norfolk as ""stone,"" tough, hardened and determined, while he filmed Walsingham, Elizabeth's key ally, as ""water,"" fluid, flexible and behind-the-scenes.  Water will wear out the stone in the long run, he says in the commentary.

The director also discusses the film's central emphasis on the development of Elizabeth from a young woman into a position of political power.  He states, ""To be a great leader, you have to be totally detached,"" and his film and his commentary amply display Elizabeth's progression from emotional youth to powerful monarch, with all of the benefits and costs to her and those who love her.

I found that the viewer can even watch the commentary but still follow the plot (unlike some where all you get are the visuals with the commentary blocking out the story itself); in other words, the commentary is not a second experience that could've been put on a separate disk, but it follows hand-in-hand with the film.  Obviously, you might want to watch the film first without the commentary, but my point is that the commentary enriches, without wiping out, the story with comments of historical and directorial importance and interest.

We learn that they are Protestants, and that they don't agree with the religious beliefs of Queen Mary (Kathy Burke), a Catholic. Soon enough, a young woman is also arrested. She is Elizabeth (Cate Blanchett), stepsister to Mary, and a Protestant. Elizabeth is accused of treason, and sent to the Tower, in order to wait for her fate to be decided...

Of course, nothing happens, and our main character continues to live allowing the film to continue, but those first scenes give us a glimpse of what kind of life Elizabeth must have led in her youth, amid constant fear of execution and whispers of betrayal. Not much afterwards, though, Queen Mary dies and Elizabeth becomes Elizabeth I. She will have more power, but also new responsibilities and different threats...

Elizabeth will have to deal with the pressure of most of her advisors to choose soon among the candidates that have asked for her hand in marriage, but she is unable to marry the one she loves, Lord Robert Dudley (Joseph Fiennes). She is surrounded by many Catholic-led conspiracies, and by quite a few that wish her ill, starting by the powerful Duke of Norfolk (Christopher Eccleston). Despite that, and thanks to her inner strenght and the counsel of a new advisor, Sir Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush), Elizabeth slowly becomes a ruler who is not afraid to make difficult decisions to stay in power, even if that involves killing those who plot against her. She seems to remember that ""I am my father's daughter. I am not afraid of anything"".

I believe that this movie tackles quite well the idea of how difficult it was to be a woman with power in Elizabeth's time, and how far a female ruler had to go to retain that power. The cast is superb, although I think that it is possible to say that Cate Blanchett's performance is the most remarkable one. I would like to add that the art direction was quite good, and that it helped to recreate the atmosphere of days long gone...

Of course, I am aware of the fact that this film is full of historical inaccuracies, but I already knew that it wasn't a documentary. Despite that, ""Elizabeth"" left me wanting to know more about the period in which all these events happened, and I am probably going to read a book on it  :)

On the whole, I highly recommend this film. It is interesting, and different. ""Elizabeth"" doesn't have much to do with historical reality, but it was inspired by it, and it might spur you to learn more about the period through other sources. What is more important, you will get at least a clue of what drove a young woman like Elizabeth to remain single, married only to England...

Some reviewers here shamelessly slam the movie based on ""historical inaccuracies."" They forget drama is not meant to be seen for research for tomorrow's homework assignment, the great dramatists like Shakespeare regularly re-wrote history when doing a drama. And even then, the script makes valid attempts to look behind the icon of Elizabeth (there is very substantial evidence that she was not really a virgin in the sexual sense and that Robert Dudely was a lover). Director Shekhar Kapur gives us a rich tapestry of characters and locations, feelings and history. An Indian, Kapur paints his movie with the lush textures of India, but he keeps a wonderful English feel to it all and Cate Blanchett is magnificent as Elizabeth, conveying strength, fear and compassion. Richard Attenborough, Geoffrey Rush and Joseph Fiennes all deliver noteworthy performances as well. The screenplay by Michael Hirst is smart, poetic and full of political intrigue. The music by David Hirschfelder is marvelous, it creates mood and provides some rich melodies like the love theme. What Kapur does with great success here is transport us to another world and time, we feel like onlookers viewing a great drama unfolding. There is pure suspense in how Elizabeth must find a way to survive and overcome her enemies. Someone complained here about the violence, obviously this person has not read that much history and well babe, history is pretty bloody. ""Elizabeth"" is a powerful experience, you can view it for the characters and drama and simply enjoy the cinematography, which is done with the eye of a painter. The costumes and light are all used to create an almost dreamy effect. And of course there is the human side of the film. It's a story about the courage to advance when thrust into a position of authority and if needing to be alert and intelligent when navigating the turbulent waters of power. ""Elizabeth"" is a wonderful tapestry of a movie, not to be missed by admirers of focused, intelligent and visually rich filmmaking.",1110585600,3,2134,5.031073446327683

Forget disappointing, this movie was appalling.  Its only semblance to history were the names used.  If you're looking for a bit of entertainment with sex and violence in costume, and you have no respect for the reputations of real people who lived and died four hundred years ago, you might like this movie.  If you watch it, please remember that, as a source of historical insight on the characters of Elizabeth and her court, this movie is complete and utter garbage.",1110585600,11,637,4.601769911504425
1023191,1,6305358591,"While the reviewer below certainly is wrong about the historical facts, he is right, this movie is a terrible distortion of English history. To enlighten him and those who're interested in ""the wisest woman who ever lived"" (William Cecil):

1) There WAS a mood of rising protestantism as this movie starts. (1558) Mary HAD been popular after overthrowing the tragic Lady Jane Grey and her greedy father. She had been popular for being King Henry's daughter and for what she had to go through in her father's reign. BUT when she began to burn old men, women and even pregnant women she lost a great deal of sympathy. And when she married England's arch-enemy, Catholic King Philipp of Spain (Her mother's great-nephew) she lost whatever love the English had for this half-Spanish Queen. The fact that she supported her husband in an expensive war against France and that she lost Calais also cost her a great deal and it showed what a bad ruler she was. Heretical rebels? Old priests like gentle Thomas Cranmer and pregnant peasant-women were heretical rebels? However biased can one be!

2) Mary DID NOT like to surrender her throne to her mother's rival's daughter. Only when Elizabeth agreed to pay Mary's horrid debts and agreed to to fight Catholicism didn't Mary resign to her fate. (After two phantm-pregnancies)

Now for Nr. 3: To say that Elizabeth was impotent as Queen is laughable. I'll refute the ""examples"" one by one.

Accusation: A: She had personally given her royal assurance to the Spanish Minister that the Spanish treasure ships bearing the pay for Alva's soldiers in the Netherlands, the ships which had taken refuge from pirates in English harbors, should be released and the money taken under safeguards to its proper destination. Cecil simply overruled her. He ordered the money to be confiscated and his orders were obeyed, not hers.

Answer: Ever heard of the word diplomacy? It had been Elizabeth's plan to seize the ships from the beginning. She, being a magnificent liar, sweet-talked the Spanish ambassador while Cecil took the blame. He obeyed his Queen's REAL wishes. And was honoured afterwards. I'm sure Elizabeth had a good laugh at the Spaniards' folly. By seizing these ships Elizabeth not only hurt the Spaniards but won the support and friendship of the Netherlands (Fellow protestants). Later she sent Leicester down there as gouvenor. She won the support of the Netherlands, Scotland, the Hugenotts etc. by this brilliant act of diplomacy. Cecil, being his mistress' ""conscience"" bore the blame gracefully.

Accusation2: ""B: She desired to save Norfolk. Three separate times she tried to stop the execution. Cecil overruled and had him put to death.""

Not true. Since Norfolk was a relative of the Queen it's natural that having to sign his death-warrant caused her grief. Plus he was a Duke by blood, one of the oldest families in the country. Cecil NEVER overruled Queen Elizabeth, he was wise enough to warn those who wanted to that if they dared to attack her as a sovereign she'd cut them down with no mercy. One whom he advised but who didn't listen was the Earl of Essex. Elizabeth had him put to death for trying to overrule and depose her. If needed, she was as hard as iron.

Accusation Nr. 3: ""C: She tried to recall Drake and stop England from declaring war on Spain. No one thought to heed her orders.""

Another brilliant way of diplomacy that he misunderstood. Elizabeth ""wanted"" to recall Drake when he was ""safely far away enough"" to attack Cadiz ""against the Queen's wishes"". She made a fuss, kept the booty and prevented the Armada from sailing much sooner than it actually did. She knighted Drake for all he did.

Accusation Nr. 4 ""D: The supreme example is the murder of Mary, Queen of Scots. We are often led to believe that Elizabeth faked remorse at having her cousin executed. This is totally false. Elizabeth was horrified. She did everything she could to stop Ceil from having Mary beheaded. Again, no one paid attention to England great, powerful, wise Queen Elizabeth, so legendary for her strength of will and character.""

Now this is completely off the mark. Mary, Queen of Scots, who had planned to murder her cousin, had her husband murdered (To marry her husband's murderer whose children she would have born out of wedlock otherwise) had been deposed by her outraged people who wanted to have her executed. Mary, after abusing Elizabeth's patience for years, fled to England. The country she wanted to rule herself. As for Elizabeth on Mary's death: The only qualms she had were the facts that it wasn't wise to have another Queen executed and that Mary was her cousin. She had protected Mary for over 17 years from her council and her people. When she signed the warrant it was dispatched and done with. She DID fake remorse AND was horrified at the same time. She dismissed both Walsingham and Cecil after the deed for a long time. Plus the man who delivered the warrant to be dealt with (Davison) was condemned to die which was later turned to life in prison. Cecil DID NOT have Mary put to death. Elizabeth signed the death-warrant. If anyone had a major part in this it was Lord Walsingham. Get your facts straight and don't spread nonsense.

Accusation Nr. 5: ""Elizabeth secretly held deep sympathy for the Catholic Church. As a young girl, she grew up amidst the cynical, elitist class of intellectuals who doubted Catholicism mainly because they wanted its wealth. Elizabeth was naturally influenced by such propaganda. But in time, she grew to understand just how villainous was the plundering of England's great abbeys and churches so that greedy nobles, disguised as religious reformers, could grow wealthier. It is said that if the King of Spain had launched an attack and seized England, she would have helped him.""

This is complete nonsense for several reasons. When it came down to decide which cause she should support it was always Protestantism which she chose. She herself wasn't a Puritan (Like Walsingham was) and didn't burn Catholics but when it came down to punish those Catholics who wanted to murder her (Babington is the most prominent figure) she had no problem to have them tortured and killed as traitors. Nothing of Elizabeth's thoughts on her father's deeds (Plundering the abbeys and churches) was ever recorded, it was, like her thoughts on her mother, a private matter which she never spoke of. (No testimonies survived) So don't ASSUME things, this is not fiction, it's history. And the evidence points against that lame theory. As for THIS: ""It is said that if the King of Spain had launched an attack and seized England, she would have helped him.""

Well he DID! Does the ARMADA ring a bell? And Elizabeth didn't help her enemy there, that's for sure. She went to see her troops in person and spoke to them passionately to overthrow the enemy! And BOY, they won magnificently! After that Elizabeth became GLORIANA. So that ""theory"" is certainly false.

Now to this movie. It's wrong beyond belief. Elizabeth is portrayed as a weakling who's influenced first by Dudley, then by Walsingham. (Who wasn't her advisor back then) Plus the stories of Marie de Guise being murdered, Marie de Guise sleeping with her nephew, Elizabeth sleeping with Dudley, the Spanish ambassador being murdered etc. are all fiction. I could go on and on about the costumes being all wrong, the locations totally off etc. But it's not necessary. For a real portrait of England's greatest monarch ever watch Elizabeth R. with Glenda Jackson. She makes you believe what Elizabeth said: ""I will have no master but only one mistress here!""",1110412800,15,7623,4.866615265998458
1023192,1,6305358591,"There is nothing historical about this movie. I could go into a long list of the details, but here are just a few of the problems:

1) There was no dominating mood of rising Protestantism in England. Mary Tudor was EXTREMELY POPULAR with the English people, who were almost entirely Catholic and hated the newfangled protestant heresies. The only areas where protestant schism had any hold whatsoever was London and a few smaller cities. The general population had no problem with Mary and her council's execution of heretical rebels.

2) Mary DID NOT try to keep Elizabeth from the throne. Elizabeth was involved in an early plot to overthrow Catholicism in England, but when that plot was foiled, Elizabeth swore to her elder sister that she was firmly Catholic. Mary believed her, and died happily thinking that she'd left the throne to a strong Catholic heir.

3) Elizabeth was virtually impotent as queen. Most of the time, her orders were simply ignored. The country was essentially run by her chancellor William Cecil. A few examples provided by Hillaire Belloc:

  A: She had personally given her royal assurance to the Spanish Minister that the Spanish treasure ships bearing the pay for Alva's soldiers in the Netherlands, the ships which had taken refuge from pirates in English harbors, should be released and the money taken under safeguards to its proper destination. Cecil simply overruled her. He ordered the money to be confiscated and his orders were obeyed, not hers.

  B: She desired to save Norfolk. Three separate times she tried to stop the execution. Cecil overruled and had him put to death.

  C: She tried to recall Drake and stop England from declaring war on Spain. No one thought to heed her orders.

  D: The supreme example is the murder of Mary, Queen of Scots. We are often led to believe that Elizabeth faked remorse at having her cousin executed. This is totally false. Elizabeth was horrified.

1023193,3,6305358591,"Queen Elizabeth I of England is one of the most impressive figures in European history. She came to the throne in 1558 at the age of twenty-five, upon the death of her half sister, Mary I. It was a time of much political instability, and the young Queen's task was made even more difficult by the fact that her legitimacy was by no means universally acknowledged (many saw her father Henry VIII's marriage to Elizabeth's mother, Anne Boleyn, as being invalid, since he was never granted a Papal dispensation for the annulment of his first marriage to Catherine of Aragon, Mary's mother), and by the fact that Elizabeth was a Protestant. And on top of all this, many of the English people were far from jubilant at the prospect of another female ruler, after the disastrous reign of her sister Mary. The years immediately following Elizabeth's ascent to the throne, therefore, were fraught with uncertainty and danger. In order to retain her crown and win the hearts of her people, Elizabeth would have to become a strong, almost superhuman figure, and it is this formative process that the film ""Elizabeth"" seeks to show us.

Unfortunately, the film does not entirely succeed. Elizabeth reigned for 44 years, an extremely long time. Her maturation and the development of her status as a national icon were shaped by a series of trials, both political and personal, that took place over the course of multiple decades. It would be nearly impossible to accurately show all this in a 2-hour movie. ""Elizabeth"" suffers from the fact that the makers of the film simply tried to cram too much material into the 124 minutes they had to work with. It could be called a ""Cliffs Notes"" version of Elizabeth's story - the film provides a sketchy overview, but you wouldn't want to rely on this as your primary source of information. Many events are truncated, jumbled together, and even shown out of historical order, with the effect that they make very little sense. One would have to have considerable knowledge of Elizabeth's life before seeing the movie to really understand what is supposed to be happening in many of the scenes. The relationship between events is not readily apparent from the movie itself. But the problem, for those that come to the movie with previous knowledge if Elizabeth, is that they will also notice all the historical inaccuracies in the film. And there are many.

For one, there is no evidence whatsoever that the relationship between Elizabeth and Robert Dudley was ever sexual, yet very early on in the film there is a sex scene between the two. That they loved each other very much is undisputed, but Elizabeth was rarely left alone, even in her private chambers, being almost constantly attended by her ladies in waiting, and there would have been very little opportunity for her to let the relationship go so far. Furthermore, Elizabeth would have been aware of the inherent risks in having a sexual relationship - primarily that of becoming pregnant. In addition, she knew she could never marry Lord Robert, for he was already married to Amy Robsart (and she did indeed know of this, though the film seems to imply that she was unaware of it prior to Cecil's announcement of the fact), and Dudley was also extremely unpopular with most of the members of court, and it is unlikely that Elizabeth would have risked her throne - a very real danger - by carrying out a sexual affair with him.

Even more confusing, the latter part of the film implicates Dudley as a co-conspirator in a plot against Elizabeth. This makes no sense at all. Though there were times when the real Dudley incurred the Queen's displeasure, and fell temporarily out of favor, their disagreements were usually short-lived, and the two remained good friends their entire lives. Dudley's last letter to Elizabeth was a love letter, and when Elizabeth herself died years later, this letter was found on the table beside her bed. Another discrepancy is the fact that the Duke of Anjou shown in the film is the wrong Duke of Anjou. Elizabeth was indeed courted by Henry, Duke of Anjou, and he did indeed cross-dress, but he never visited her. Much later his younger brother Francis, who took on the title after Henry ascended the throne of France as Henry III, took up the suit of Elizabeth, and he was the one who travelled to England. But he was never known to cross-dress. The film also implies that Francis Walsingham conspired to assassinate Mary of Guise, regent of Scotland. First of all, it was Cecil and not Walsingham who was sent to Scotland, and secondly, Mary of Guise died of dropsy. There are numerous other, more minor inaccuracies, but it would be tedious to list them all here. For more information on the real Elizabeth, I highly recommend the biography ""The Life of Elizabeth I"" by Alison Weir.

On the flipside, the film is saved by Cate Blanchett's magnificent portrayal of Elizabeth herself. Blanchett definitely deserved her Golden Globe Award for Best Actress, and she alone is the reason I actually added this movie to my collection. She is also the only reason I would ever have even watched this movie more than once. Blanchett has a very strong screen presence, and really captures the intricacies of Elizabeth's character. She is the backbone of the film, without which it would undoubtedly have crumpled into a shapeless mess. The other actors - primarily Joseph Fiennes as Robert Dudley, Richard Attenborough as William Cecil, Geoffrey Rush as Sir Francis Walsingham, and Christopher Eccleston as the Duke of Norfolk - do admirable jobs, but the ways in which the film skews their characters undermine their performances. The only other thing I would really commend this film for is its costuming, which is magnificent. Elizabeth's wardrobe alone is stunning. The DVD Special Features are decent, though not overly impressive. There are two trailers, two featurettes on the making of the film, a photo gallery, and information on cast and crew.",1107561600,52,5971,4.856722276741904
1023194,2,6305358591,"When I bought this DVD I knew that it would be somewhat historically inaccurate. I was prepared for that because most historical movies are off in some aspects. I popped it into my computer and at first felt okay with everything that was going on. That was until about fifteen or twenty minutes into the movie after Elizabeth was crowned queen. Everything went straight down hill from there.

The first thing that bothered me a bit was when they showed a sex scene between Elizabeth and Robert Dudley. It could have very well happened but there was never any proof that it did. It would have been more interesting if they let it happen the way it really did, where nobody knew exactly if they were having sex or not. For example, showing Elizabeth and Robert spending a lot of time together and maybe have a seen where one of Elizabeth's ladies stumbles in on them together when Elizabeth is only in her nightgown early in the morning. It leaves you thinking in the end because you never actually saw them getting intimate. Still, I didn't let that scene ruin the movie for me.

After that scene the movie just heads down confusion lane. I tried forgetting everything I knew about Elizabeth's life in hopes that I would understand the plot but I just couldn't. Then I tried using the knowledge I obtained from reading several books about Elizabeth and I still didn't comprehend what was happing. Not only was the plot jumping about at a hyperactive pace but some scenes were just so absurd I couldn't help but laugh even though the moment was supposed to be serious. Such as one scene where this cloaked assassin is walking down the hallway towards Elizabeth. All she does is stand there and watch him approach with this confused look on her face. Since when is she left totally alone in a hallway with some masked stranger coming towards her and she doesn't even do anything? There was also another scene where one of Elizabeth's suitors comes to woe her into marriage. He stays for a bit and is hanging out in a room with scantly clad men and women when Elizabeth bursts in to find him dressed as a girl and wearing make-up. How hilarious is that? It's true that Elizabeth was offered a husband who did cross-dress but it was his brother that visited her. Besides, you think he would have enough sense not to cross-dress in a foreign ruler's palace, right? Seesh. What an embarrassment on the director's part.

I'm being completely honest when I say that I'm not being an overly harsh critic of this movie. I love reading about history and watching historical movies and television shows but this movie was a huge disappointment. I'm okay with getting some facts wrong but getting practically every single thing wrong and turning it into a huge jumbled up mess? No, I don't think so. This movie doesn't even show how great of a ruler Elizabeth was at all. Anything political that was attempted was always deluded with some silly scene that blew the whole mood into something strange -probably some sexual matter. To me this movie is nothing but a confusing lie.

The only good things about this movie was that it was somewhat beautiful with its nice costumes and the acting was well done. Those are the only reasons why I give 'Elizabeth' an extra star.",1103932800,9,3255,4.626297577854671

Elizabeth as well had to battle the pope and her people's loyalty to the Catholic Church. Alliances were made and broken by marriage proposals. Spain, France, Scotland, and England were all locked in battle for supremacy. Her scandalous affair with Robert Dudley continued.

It brings home nicely the conflict between protestants and catholics, and the fact that Elizabeth allowed many catholic nobles to remain in her court.  But the period suffered from having too many Marys -- Mary Tudor (daughter of Catherine of Aragon), Mary of Guise, and Mary Queen of Scots.  The last is by far the best known to most Britons of today, and this movie confuses by totally excluding her.  I'm not a historian, but I spent most of the film assuming that Mary of Guise was another name for Mary Queen of Scots.  So I was perplexed when she was murdered in her bed, rather than beheaded at Fotheringay.  The failure to mention Babington or David Riccio also meant that another two of the principal characters of the era were omitted.  It would also have been nice to see the plot include  the suspected murder of Dudley's wife (in which Dudley and Elizabeth herself were implicated).

But historical omissions aside, this is a sumptuous portrayal of the era, and a great means of getting people intrigued to discover more. (I went on to buy Michael Wood's IN SEARCH OF SHAKESPEARE as a result, for example).

More's the pity that she and many the other fine actors in the cast are so ill-served by the writer of this script, who clearly has only the barest acquaintance with (or interest in) the real Elizabeth, whose story is so much more compelling than this confused (and confusing) mess. I have been an avid student of Tudor history for forty years, and I was hard put to follow this disaster of a script. Most of the characters are simply unrecognizable as historical figures. For example, William Cecil (portrayed here by the octegenarian Sir Richard Attenorough) was a mere thirty-eight years old at Elizabeth's accession in 1558, and remained her chief minister for forty years, succeeded by his own son, Robert. The film is riddled with many other similar stupidities (check out, for example, the scenes of Henri III of France and Mary de Guise - simply laughable). If you really want some genuine insight into Elizabeth I (and Cate Blanchett is given no opportunity to provide any indication whatsoever of the real Elizabeth's political astuteness, cleverness or humour, all of which kept her alive during very dangerous times), then get hold of the BBC's still compelling series, Elizabeth R, with Glenda Jackson still unsurpassed as Elizabeth, portrayed over fifty years from 1553-1603. There are too many ridiculous anachronisms and other inaccuracies in the present film to list here, but the gratuitous (and horrific) burning scene at the very beginning, the totally anachronistic surroundings (Tudor palaces did not resemble cavernous Gothic opera sets) and the depiction of Mary Tudor as a raving imbecile stand out among many howlers. The appearance on the soundtrack of the Mozart Requiem (composed in 1791, over 230 years too late!) seals this film's fate, revealing the utter ineptitude of its producers.....Don't film makers/script writers do any research about the subjects they pretend to explore? A gratuitous waste of resources, and a grave disappointment. Someone should make a good film about Elizabeth I, she's certainly a fit subject for one. Until then, watch Glenda Jackson. Now there's a portrayal that Elizabeth herself could hardly have bettered! The terrible disservice performed by an irresponsible (and expensive!) film like this is reflected in the depressing number of positive reviews of it written by people who will have no chance from this travesty to find out anything about the real Elizabeth I. A great pity, and a totally missed opportunity.",1093219200,59,2522,5.1838235294117645
1023276,5,6305358591,"Everytime I come upon this movie I fall prey and end up sitting right through to the end. One would imagine it'd jade a bit the fifth time one watched it, but nope.

First thing that hooks me up is the fascinating lighting and the camera angles that perfectly complement it. Darkly lit shots of glorious British castles. Impulsive burst of royal dances. Mesmerizing.

Next, the grand costumes. Not just grand in fact but gorgeously color coordinated. I suspect they use shots from this film in fashion design courses.

Then, the undercurrent of a seductive romance between Blanchett and Fiennes practically sizzles the screen. Much is unsaid, a lot undone. The delight of unrequited infatuations!

As though all that's not enough, the film packs a full punch of conspiracies, intrigue, wars without battles, trust, betrayal, religious tirades.

Critics lament that it doesn't do justice to history. Well, historical context is seldom a breeze so if you read too much into Elizabeth's rocky childhood (Henry the 8th, her father, was emotionally/sexually quite a convoluted man) then the film seems sparse on intricate detail and its possible effects on the young queen's psyche. Of course.

If on the other hand you are willing to forgive the director's decision to refrain from condensing 20 chequered adoloscent years into a 2 hour narrative, and focusing instead on the period of her thorny ascent to the biggest throne of the world in her time, a time when she also fell in love, then this nearly flawless production is a DVD that deserves a proud seat in your collection.",1092700800,15,1575,4.969581749049429
1023277,3,6305358591,"If you're not bothered by historical inaccuracies, then go ahead and check out this movie.  It's extremely well-acted for the most part, although Fiennes's Dudley turns milksop in an entirely fictitious turn of events that aligns him with a Catholic plot to replace Elizabeth with Mary, Queen of Scots (whose death in the movie is all wrong, too).  Events from decades later are all condensed into what is clearly supposed to be the first year or two of Elizabeth's reign (which begain in 1558): Norfolk didn't rebel until the Northern Rebellion in 1569; Elizabeth wasn't excommunicated until 1570; she didn't even enter the Anjou courtship until 1578; and Mary, Queen of Scots was beheaded in public, not murdered in her bed, and that not until almost thirty years later, in 1587!  Furthermore, in 1558 Lord Robert Dudley was not yet Earl of Leicester (he wouldn't be until Elizabeth gave him that title in 1564, and he was NEVER a duke!), and as another reviewer has pointed out, there's certainly more drama and intrigue in his REAL story than the movie allows -- he was rumored to have murdered his wife, Amy Robsart, after all.
I won't go on, but my point is that there is a hell of a lot wrong with the storyline that didn't even need to be wrong.  It's still an entertaining movie, as I mentioned before, and Cate Blanchett really does deliver an exceptional performance.  But at least some sort of gesture towards a measure of historical accuracy would have been appreciated.",1090022400,14,1483,4.77734375

1023381,4,6305358591,"I loved this movie. Cate Blanchett played a marvelous Elizabeth, almost looked exactly like her as well. She has the right accent and even the right attitude to play the Virgin Queen. Strength was a bright aura around Cate throughout the entire film as well as the famous quick- thinking the Queen always was reported of having. Although there was a few places artistic license was stamped, it was almost the exact way things happened to the Virgin Queen, I know because I did a whole report on her a year ago in school. The only place they did a real doozy on was this passionate bond between the Duke and Elizabeth. See, back then, many believed that the Queen and the Duke had this affair going on, but it was never proven to be true. So I guess the movie took it as a good pathway for a little romance in the movie and made this a lovey- dovey part of the story. But really this is the only place they put heavy artistic license on.
This movie is passionate and bold, showing how a woman ruled England in the most harshest times for women to even own their own household much less an entire country. Cate illuminated the Virgin Queen perfectly in both her strong moments and in her unsure times, telling the story of a princess shut out of society and then ultimately being thrown into royalty after her sister dies. The main problem they show clearly in this film is not her being a woman, although that's what you would assume, but it's actually becuase of religion. Due to the fact Mary, her sister who ruled before her was Catholic, the England was ran through this religion. But now Elizabeth is Protestant, and like in real life, she refused as she ascended the throne to change her belief. She also refuses as in real life throughout the movie to get married, claiming at the end of the movie that she was married- to her country of England.
This film is above all a great biography of Elizabeth. It shows the passion, strength, courage, pride and tender heart of Elizabeth. This film is a must see and I rcommend it to all alike. I believe everyone must know the Virgin Queen, for she was no soul to be ignored.",1081728000,6,2123,4.418367346938775

Everytime I think of how Gwyneth Paltrow ( someone who couldn't act if you taped her mouth to Meryl Streep's face ), came up and stole the Oscar we all know belonged to Cate I'm reminded of why Hollywood is now in such a horrid mess. Since then I truly realized Hollywood didn't care about real talent but who was hot at the moment. Cate had a lot of things against her: she wasn't American and she wasn't the "" conventional "" beauty though I think she's ten times more beautiful than most of the women on the big screen now. All you need to know is this is the best Elizabeth film ever made!  Since I saw it I became a Cate Blanchett fan and bent down to kiss the ground to show god how glad I was to finally find a truly great actress since the 80's. Cate Blanchett played Elizabeth with the right amount of sexuality, innocence, essence and power that could only describe the woman who led England through "" The Golden Age "". I believe Elizabeth (I) would have been honored to have such a powerful presence portray her as Cate Blanchett did.  Cate stripped the character of tasteless glamour and became the virgin queen right before our eyes. If there was ever a woman born to play a role it was Cate Blanchett as Elizabeth. If you don't see this film you are missing a wonderful version starring a mesmerizing, charming little lady who took acting to new heights. This proves once again that the Oscars has nothing to do with talent but personas. Cate will always be the Best Actress winner of 98-99 in my book.

I disagree with the comments of those who feel that this film delineated Elizabeth as a weak woman who followed the whims of men.  The fact was that, for that time period, Elizabeth wielded a great amount of power.  She was young, and one can just imagine how hard it must have been to assume the throne above many accusing one of heresy. Yes, the film shows the time it took Elizabeth to get used to her role as Queen of England. But even our modern rulers typically cannot bounce right into a prestigious political role without making mistakes or feeling unsure of their own abilities, especially not when despised by a portion of their own people.
Especially toward the end of the film, I felt that a case was made for the strength of Elizabeth's character, rather than the weakness.
I especially enjoyed the costumes and the poignant musical selections; both were quite realistic, vibrant, and strategically placed.
I even felt that the historical portion of the movie was as well-done as can be expected from Hollywood.
Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  I am of the opinion that the acting was absolutely superb, and that casting was perfect.

In virtually every scene, she makes us believe that she is Queen Elizabeth in flesh and blood, not herself potraying her.  She undeservedly lost her Oscar to Gwyneth Paltrow, but in my opinion that was because of fame, not talent.  To get further evidence of her talent, check out The Talented Mr. Ripley, and The Gift.

It is fascinating to watch the transition of Princess Elizabeth dancing in the meadow--to imprisonment in the tower--to being crowned as England's monarch--we watch as the spontaneous, earthy girl undergoes a metamorphis and emerges as a calculating and brilliant queen.  Her gender could be her undoing--but Elizabeth outwits the men in her court who wish to witness her downfall by becoming ""the virgin queen"" and aligning herself with the powerful female icon in the Catholic church--the virgin Mary.

They didn't need to put in the unlikely scenes with Elizabeth in bed with Robert Dudley, they didn't need to use modern orchestras for the music, and if they had gone with cheaper costumes and black-and-white film, I wouldn't have cared.

Equally absurd is the notion that she didn't know Leicester was married, of course she did, his marriage wasn't secret.

For instance, Elizabeth constantly had to face people secretly plotting against her and her subjects plotting against her enemies...without her knowledge.  It truly is a wonderful display of the British Empire as a whole.

To strengthen alliances, the royal council encouraged Elizabeth to consider the proposal of marriage as offered by King Phillip the II of Spain, but through King Phillip's own foolery and crude nature, the attempt to marry and ally forces failed.  Elizabeth and Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, were lovers up until the time it was disclosed Robert was already married, thereafter Elizabeth refused Robert private audience.  At was also during this time that two attempts were made on Queen Elizabeth's life.  As a result of this, Sir Francis Walsingham, killed Mary, Queen of Scots who wished to rule in Elizabeth's place, which was a turning point.  Walsingham also uncovered a plot that was signed by the Pope, Spanish Minister, Spanish King, religious leaders, Duke of Norfolk and his followers, and Robert Dudley to overthrow Queen Elizabeth.  All of her nearby enemies and traitors were executed with the exception of Robert Dudley.  Elizabeth kept Robert alive to remind her ""just how close"" the Queen had been ""to danger.""
A deeper symbolism was revealed in two scenes in this movie. The first scene symbolizes the making or beginnings of a Queen, which was when Elizabeth walked outside into a blinding light and that was when she heard that Mary, her sister the Queen, was dead, and Elizabeth was proclaimed Queen. The second scene was when Elizabeth transformed herself into the ""Virgin Queen"" and backlit from the outside light she entered the court proclaiming that she was ""married to the church"" and became the Queen.
I rate this movie a 5 stars movie because it is one of the most enthralling and believable versions of the life of Queen Elizabeth that has been made-to-date.  It makes no pretenses how people struggled to survive and the sort of treacheries that befell people for having different values, morals, religions and classes. The acting was superb. The gowns and sceneries were beautiful.  I find that I watch the kind of movies over and over that make me aspire to be greater than who I am and this is one of those movies.",1060646400,,3681,4.998363338788871

1023676,5,6305358591,"Briefly, here is the historical context.  Elizabeth I (1533-1603) was queen of England and Ireland from 1558 to 1603. During the brief reign of her brother, Edward VI, Elizabeth barely survived, especially in 1549 when those in her household were arrested and she was placed in what we now call protective custody until November 17, 1558, when her half-sister Mary died, and Elizabeth succeeded to the throne. One of her first actions as queen was to appoint Sir William Cecil (later Lord Burghley) as her chief secretary and he continued as her closest adviser. Both were aware of England's vulnerability to France and Spain. Both also knew that the key to England's success lay in playing the two great powers against each other so that neither could bring its full force to bear against England. The defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588 eliminated one serious threat to England's security and also created almost unlimited opportunities for exploration, settlement, and economic growth. When Elizabeth died in 1603, Britannia really was ""queen of the oceans.""
Directed by Shekhar Kapur and starring Cate Blanchett, this film examines Elizabeth's gradual transformation from being a free-spirited, lusty, at times reckless, and often silly young princess to becoming a sanitized, somber, and worldly-wise monarch. Several key figures are centrally involved in this process, notably Mary (Kathy Burke) and Cecil (Richard Attenborough), Robert Dudley (Joseph Fiennes), the Duke of Norfolk (Christopher Eccleston), and especially Sir Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush). Throughout her adult years, especially when protected by Walsingham, Elizabeth survived numerous assassination attempts and died of natural causes in 1603.
For me, Walsingham is at least as interesting in this film as the queen to whom he is totally devoted. He gathers what we now call intelligence data from his espionage network which extends throughout Europe and even goes after important information himself, when necessary. He also serves as a high-level diplomat as when he meets with the warrior-wonderwoman, Mary of Guise (Fanny Ardent), and assassinates her after sharing her bed. The French troops are thereby denied their leader as they await orders on the Scottish border. Walsingham is also a master of the slit throat (however young it may be) and of torture (even of Papal emissaries) if such initiatives serve the queen's purposes. In fact, her purposes ARE his purposes. We know that he served as her secretary of state from 1773 until 1590, was a member of the privy council, and knighted in recognition of brilliant and loyal service to her.
To me, the younger Elizabeth's lover Robert Dudley symbolizes the personal life which she finally and completely renounces. An indifferent husband and father as well as a minor court figure, the character of Dudley in this film offers Fiennes little to work with but he does his best. The Duke of Norfolk and the French Duc d'Anjou (Vincent Cassell) are much more interesting characters, primarily because the former poses the most serious threat to Elizabeth and the latter provides some delightful comic relief. As entertaining this film is at times, however, I still view it as a generally dark study of a very dangerous period in English history when so many wars (declared or not) were in progress or imminent at the same time. With substantial dramatic impact, it reveals how and why England's survival literally depended on someone who eventually proved to be a much greater leader than her father, Henry VIII.",1059264000,,3549,5.215411558669002

1023678,5,6305358591,"I love the movie 'Elizabeth'. It is quite interesting -- dramatic, well-acted, well-scripted, and just the right amount of intrigue and suspense for my taste. The characterisations of Elizabeth, Sussex, Sir William, Walsingham, and Robert Dudley are well done. What a pity that this is largely a work of fiction.
I sometimes have a major 'beef' with movies of this sort; not at all the movie's fault, to be sure -- the tendency on the part of the public, who has not read, and will not bother to read afterward, the history of England during the Tudor period, to see which parts are based on fact, and which parts are dramatic license. From the very start of the film, I knew that this would be largely a fictional dramatisation -- upon the death of Henry VIII, in the credits, Mary assumes the throne. What happened to the poor boy King Edward? We skipped an entire reign! To say nothing of Lady Jane Grey. Of course, she had her own movie (also one of great liberty from the actual historical events)...
The country was torn between Catholic and Protestant sentiments, as the film suggests, but these were not so neatly resolved (and in fact continue to this day to beset the Church of England, now a small minority of religious in England, with problems); Elizabeth, because she would not proclaim allegiance to the Catholic faith unreservedly, had a difficult time finding a bishop to perform the coronation (she had in the end the bishop of Carlisle).
In this film, all of the intrigues that beset Elizabeth are collapsed and promulgated in the character of a few (Spanish, French, and Papist agents) all at the beginning of her reign. In fact, Elizabeth was in the process of securing her throne throughout most of her reign. The love affair with Lord Robert Dudley is most likely true in fact, if not in the form presented here. Walsingham was in fact her trusted ally; the bishops were in fact a problem caste. Sussex, the Lord Chamberlain as the plotter for the throne is an interesting detail -- to this day, the descendants of Sussex continue as Lords Chamberlain, and remain Roman Catholics, and must petition the Pope regularly to continue in their duties (a permission never denied).
Perhaps the best facets of this film are in the mood, or style of the film. Going from uncertainty to certainty, growing in confidence and ability, going from being a girl who would be queen to a formidable woman who reigns, this is presented well in the space of a few hours. The settings, dark and medieval, not yet reflecting the glory of renaissance England which was about to be born under Elizabeth's reign; the costumes elaborate and strangely modern and medieval simultaneously (as is the story!); these things combine to make a great movie of power and intrigue.
The equation of the Virgin Queen with the Virgin Mary is an interesting one, at the conclusion of the film, as Elizabeth becomes wedded to England. In fact, she had many suitors (many of whom lost their heads over her, literally), and the idea of 'virgin' is a rather different one today than during Elizabeth's time. Of course, the Tudors were always a rather randy bunch, and Elizabeth was in many ways, as she proclaimed in her own words, 'my father's daughter'. In the end, Elizabeth remains the only unmarried monarch of marriage-able age since William Rufus, son of William the Conqueror.
The musical score, haunting and suspenseful, meditative and sombre, and finally triumphant, is memorable, but is in fact better experienced apart from the film, where the imagery and dialogue often overpowers the music.
Acting is masterful, astutely played by Cate Blanchett, Geoffrey Rush (who was nominated for the Academy Award for another Elizabethean period movie, Shakespeare in Love), Joseph Fiennes (who played Shakespeare in Shakespeare in Love), and Richard Attenborough. John Gielgud has a brief cameo appearance as the pope, but alas is fairly inconsequential in this film.
In the end, 'Elizabeth' is a victorious movie.",1055635200,3,3997,4.879411764705883

1023681,4,6305358591,"I saw this movie in the theater by myself because who else is interested in Tudor History, right?  Well, it was their loss. This film pulls you in from beginning to end.  Cate Blanchett at Elizabeth I is simply ingenius casting.  Elizabeth has been portrayed in so many other films by marvelous actresses in their later years that we seem to have a picture of a rather stiff and cartoonish type monarch when we think of Elizabeth.  Cate dispels this image from the start.  The story begins prior to Elizabeth's accession to the throne and the harsh treatment she bore from her sister Mary.  As Elizabeth's mother, Anne Boleyn, caused the banishment of Mary and her mother Catherine of Aragon, it is easy to see why Mary feels threatened by this young girl.  Elizabeth barely makes it through the later years of Mary's reign with her head.
Joseph Fiennes does a marvelous job of playing Robert Dudley.  The Queen's Master of the Horse, and as many historians believe, her lover.  The love story is entertainingly expanded upon as well as the various plots against Elizabeth's life by catholic followers.  Elizabeth's flirting way of holding her privy counsel at bay on the issue of marriage are in excellent evidence here.  She bravely proclaims ""There will be one Mistress here and NO Master!""  The fifth star is only withheld here for historical innaccuracy, but it in no way hampers the flow or entertainment value of this lavish and lovely film.  Cate deserved the Academy Award for this.  Her performance far surpasses Gwyneth Paltrow's in Shakespeare in Love, which is who she lost to that year.  Her performance, in a role that has been played by some of the greats, is both fearless and vulnerable all at the same time.",1050796800,3,1726,4.764309764309765

But Richard Attenbourough and Geoffrey Rush are equally good, and the costume and set design is nothing short of phenomenal.  Watch this film on a big screen and you'll feel like you're a wall in the castle.  It's that real.

1023683,5,6305358591,"This film is a masterpiece about a great queen of England, Elisabeth I. She became queen nearly by accident after a brother who tried to eradicate catholicism after Henry VIII in the most austere vision ever thought by anyone, then a sister who tried to eradicate protestantism in blood and fire. She understood that the better interest of the country was to stand on its own legs and to defy any alliance with Spain, France or the Pope. She decided that England was above everything, every personal and particular interest. She got rid of all those who were plotting either on the French side or the Spanish side and she declared herself married once and for all with England itself and no other person at all. She became the Virgin Queen in the blood of the plotters and she managed to make the interest of England the only objective of her reign and of all those who wanted some peace at home and abroad. She built a kingdom and a monarchy that became the strongest in the world and on the oceans, a monarchy that was strong enough to survive the terrible seventeenth century, the Stuarts and the Puritan Revolution. Her self-sacrifice was the cement that made this country what it still is. She is probably the real founder of England as we know it : proud, strong and inspired with a world vision that goes beyond imperialism and contemplates the virtues of freedom, justice and human rights, even if she used some tools and methods that were not always perfectly clean : she only hit at the head of all the plots and prevented any civil war, hence protecting the people and their welfare.

1023684,3,6305358591,"Elizabeth is quite my favorite member of English Royalty, and I had always felt that her life would make for a brilliant movie. So I was terribly excited when this movie came out-- and I cringed and writhed in fury through the whole thing.
  Yes, I will grant it is beautiful cinematography, costumes, acting, dramatic tension, etc (hence the 3 stars), HOWEVER! I expected dramatic license, but that they would strip away her brilliance, her independance and self-reliance, everything that made her the fascinating woman we know and respect, was a shock and a severe disappointment.
  From the first shot of her floating about flowery fields in wispy clothes, and frolicking with her boyfriend, through the heartbreak! that turns her into a murderous machine, the whole thing was nauseating.  The woman in this movie starts out naive, trusting her lover, is disappointed by him, and consequently places her trust in another man as murderous and unscrupulous as the first was gorgeous. ""Most lame and impotent"" character development.
  In reality, Elizabeth had had to save herself from the scaffold from a very early age with only her wits to rely on; she was a skilled diplomat before she ever even knew for certain she would acceed to the throne; she depended on no one, and indeed deliberately played her couselors against each other so that none could gain absolute power over her; she was certainly not indebted for her throne to a series of political assassinations.
 This movie is an insult to women, as it blatantly ignores all the strong characteristics of one of the most powerful women in history and reduces her to a sap who must cling to the men in her life to help turn her into steel.
  Cate Blanchett was brilliant: it is one of the supreme tragedies of this film that she was wasted on it and she will not be available to play in the better version that I desperately hope someone will take it upon themselves to produce.",1037577600,4,1938,4.775449101796407

As far as I can tell, this film has got all its historical facts right, but not necessarily in the right order. However, as a piece of historical drama, this is pretty good stuff. The Tudor dynasty was a violent period, and the opening shot of heretics being burnt at the stake captures that period perfectly. Murder, intrigue, torture, and espionage are the currency of power and no one is safe, not even a Queen. The sheer horriblness of this period is what makes it so fascinating, and Shekhar Kapur doesn't let us down. The drama is so taut and well paced that I am gripped by this film each time I see it. The acting is spot on. Does Dickie Attenborough ever put on a bad performance? However, Cate Blanchett is a revelation. I had never seen her before this film, but was held entranced by her. A wonderful performance by a fine actress whom I am sure will go on to have a great career. My only criticism would be that she is maybe a little too beautiful to play good Queen Bess. Elizabeth is one of my favourite historical films.

1023774,4,6305358591,"This stylishly filmed historical drama covers the ascendancy of Elizabeth to the throne of England. Cate Blanchett is excellent as the young princess Elizabeth, who survives the plotting of her half-sister Mary and her Catholic supporters and takes the throne upon the death of the childless queen.
This film is more about holding on to a shaky throne by means of secret negotiations, assasination and conspiracy. There is little of the ""real"" history, though there is one tiny fragment of Elizabeth I's Tilbury speech (""I know I have the body but of a weak and feeble woman; but I have the heart and stomach of a king"") and a Reader's Digest version of the Marriage Speech to Parliament ends the film. So if you are a history buff, you may be disappointed, but if you like conspiracy and dark plotting, this is definitely your film.
The cast is fine, with Cate Blanchett moving smoothly and believably from the young princess to the care-worn and nervous queen. Joseph Fiennes is good as Dudley, and I especially liked Geoffrey Rush as Walsingham.
The cinematography is good, though the director seems to go overboard with top-down shots that give a great view of cathedral columns but get tiresome after the fifth or sixth time you peer at a scene from a pigeon's viewpoint. The sound on this DVD is particularly good--the surround sound was excellent. Sometimes the score is overpowering but the music is always thrilling (Galliards and Pavanes at the beginning and ending, inexplicably but thrillingly with Mozart's Requiem.)

1023777,5,6305358591,"Elizabeth is a fine movie featuring the many talents of Cate Blanchett, Geoffrey Rush, John Gielgud, Joseph Fiennes, Richard Attenborough, and more. Though not historically accurate, it is nonetheless a tribute to the monarch, who is displayed as a woman who progresses from an unassertive individual to one who, as Queen Elizabeth, has the power to create what is regarded as the Golden Age of England's history.
Upon inheriting the throne from half-sister, Mary of Scots, Elizabeth is faced with legions of foes. Her opponents are those heading the Catholic church and are essentially looking for a theocrat who, as her predecessor had done, will continue to make Catholicism thrive and persecute those of other faiths. Elizabeth, however, is the antithesis of their desires, for she seeks to loosen ties with Rome and help establish a Church of England. Not only does this stance sit unfavorably with many religious and political leaders, but the very fact that she was not born into the Catholic faith leads many to disregard her as a true Queen of England.
Throughout the movie, the rivals and, to a certain extent, supporters of Elizabeth meet with forces from France, Spain and Rome to undermine her authority as Queen of England. She is faced with various choices as given to her by her initial advisors: If she marries the ruler of either France or Spain, then she will become the wife of a leader whose empire is mightier than hers and thus make England subordinate, or if she decides to no longer continue as Queen, then the doorway will be open for the Catholic massacres to continue.
Elizabeth decides neither, for she wants to remain in power without having to marry a powerful individual she does not love or even like. Upon resolution, she changes her administration and appoints a confidant who is well aware of the political and religious scenes that threaten her security to the throne.
Intermittently in the picture, there is one supporter who lacks confidence in her ability simply because of her gender. As an ultimate response that seems to set the tone for the remaining third of the picture, she firmly retorts that she is her father's daughter and that if she chooses so, she can have the heart of a man.
It is from that scene that the viewer might be led to think that perhaps Elizabeth wants to replicate Henry VIII's reign and that the determination to ""think like a man"" will lead her to triumph. But I say that that they are only pieces of the formula, because with time she is revealed as an intelligent person who is increasingly cunning.
And when she finds out that her once intimidating opponents now want her dead after discovering that they have placed their signatures on documents that declare her an ""illegitimate"" heir ... she sees clearly where things unequivocally stand and can then face this hateful resistance like a woman scorned...",1034899200,,2879,4.853658536585366

Following the trail as Elizabeth goes from princess to her rocky start as queen, the film captures the spirit of the era with the music, bawdy humor and language. It's easy to slip into the time and forget the modern world around you.
Virtually perfectly paced, the film feels comprehensive in telling the tale of the queen's start, and makes you thirsty for knowledge on her reign. And that's how you tell if a historical film works: If it makes you want to learn more about its subject. Elizabeth does just that.

1023836,5,6305358591,"This film quickly became on of my very favorites. It clearly falls within the genre of costume drama, but manages to portray the intrigues of the period in sufficiently byzantine fashion as to keep the viewer riveted and in suspense DESPITE the fact that all of us know Elizabeth ""wins"" in the end.
Cate Blanchett is truly one amazing actress, and demonstrates an incredible range of emotion in what must have been a very difficult part to play. She cleverly reflects Elizabeth, threatened by her fanatical and mad sister, Bloody Mary. During this interview with the dying queen, Blanchett reflects terror, integrity and apprehension at the death warrant in her sister's hands, while at the same time showing a calculating ambition and desire for the throne using her eyes alone. During the early days of Elizabeth's reign, we see a queen who is incredibly inexperienced and niaive, but at the same time Blanchett's performance laces that character with steel, such that her emergence in later days as a iron fist does not seem a sudden and unbelievable transition minus the velvet. Her Walsingham, played to perfection by Geoffrey Rush, seems written 1/3 historical character, 1/3 John Dee, and 1/3 Nicolo Machiavelli. This must be the finest performance of Rush's career to date, and there is some contest as to whether he, or Blanchett, truly dominates this film. Fanny Ardant, playing Mary of Guise with vile yet sweet seductiveness as only she can, is another powerful performance, despite her limited time on the screen in the film. Kathy Burke's mad Queen Mary is vilely terrifying in her Catholic devotion and desire to eradicate the protestant threat, and the comedienne shows herself made of greater stuff than past given credit for. There are some disappointing performances. Christopher Eccleston's Duke Norfolk lacks depth, coming over as a smug bully without the mental agility to perform the political feats we see him accomplish in the film. Joseph Fiennes, one of the most overrated of actors, again shows his ability to portray emotion limited exclusively to eyebrows and facial expressions. Im not sure whether the role was written with ""cute, cocky toy-boy"" in mind, but as this is all that J. Fiennes seems capable of, its what you see.
What is truly amazing about this film is the fact that, despite an almost total lack of ""action"" until the last few minutes, and the fact that it focuses on plots, counter-plots, intrigues and counter-intrigues, it still more than manages to keep the viewer engrossed and rivetted. Yes, historical events were modified to make the film more engrossing (the ""bloodbath"" at the end actually took decades to complete, and many of those ""removed"" were done so through exile, rather than assassination/execution). However, the film relies substantially on the ability of its performers to carry the effect off, and Rush/Blanchett and others do this with magnificent grace and eloquence. These performances manage to keep you mentally engaged throughout.
Bearing in mind that Elizabeth has been synonamous with Glenda Jackson in most minds, it is great to finally have a performance by yet another brilliant actress which not only compares favorably, but perhaps supercedes that of Dame Jackson in the role.",1025308800,5,3259,5.1163227016885555
1023837,5,6305358591,"Shekar Kapur's account of the early years of Elizabeth I's reign in not your average costume drama, it is a visceral and entrancing film that despite all the historical inaccuracies that other reviewers have noted (and they are many), perfectly captures the climate of religious conflict, struggle for power and constant danger that characterised the beginning of Elizabeth's reign. Michael Hirst's script portrays the young queen as an innocent caught in the throes of international politics, who by the end of the film has become a calculating monarch willing to sacrifice almost anything to ensure her survival and the welfare and prosperity of her kingdom. Kapur's brilliant direction gives the film a vertiginous rhythm, while Remi Adefarasin's ominous cinematography adds a menacing and sinister atmosphere that sometimes gives Elizabeth the feel of a horror movie. Also worthy of praise are the magnificent production design, the gorgeous costumes and a surprisingly eclectic soundtrack that includes Byrd, Mozart, Holst and Elgar as well as some great original music.
The acting is also excellent. Especially Geoffrey Rush as the unscrupulous yet reliable Walsingham; Christopher Eccleston as the devious Duke of Norfolk; Richard Attenborough as Cecil, Elizabeth's most loyal and trusted aide; and Kathy Burke as the frustrated and paranoid ""Bloody Mary"". However, the real jewel is Cate Blanchett's amazing, star-making turn as the title character. She gives a complex, mesmerising and moving performance as she makes the transition from scared and vulnerable young woman to quasi-preternatural icon.
If you are interested in the ""true historical facts"" of Elizabeth's reign you should choose a documentary of one of the many great books that have been written about her (my favourite is Alison Weir's biography), but if you are looking for a great cinematic experience that explores the young queen's personality and motivations in remarkable depth this is definitely the one to choose. In my opinion Shekar Kapur's masterpiece is the best film of its kind.",1024531200,10,2067,5.442367601246106
1023838,3,6305358591,"In and of itself, as a movie, this film is superb. However, it bears little resemblance to what we know from history. There were three major aspects that struck me most: Firstly, the time frame in which the events of the movie took place. Usually tweaking in this department is permissable in film, but the script squashes together what happened over 30 years into what happened within Elizabeth's twenties. The overall effect is rather damaging to historical merit. Secondly, the portayal of Elizabeth is way off, particularly in how she viewed her rise to power. She was not naive and afraid of her power when she took the throne, but a hardened politician who KNEW her power, and how to use it. She was an extremely intelligent woman, who was fluent in many languages and who had extensive classical learning. And thirdly, her relationship with Robert is rather altered in a major way...she NEVER slept with him, she was a true virgin. There are little things too, like the dress, and the way the French prince conducted himself in front of the queen...that kind of behavior would have NEVER taken place. This can be researched indepth online or through books on the subject, such as Elizabethian biographies.
Usually a lack of accuracy will give me distaste for a film. However, as a movie, Elizabeth is too good. Dark, chilling, and at times rather terrifying, it is a pleasure to the senses and a joy for those who like their minds provoked.",1019520000,,1447,4.768924302788845
1023839,5,6305358591,"Elizabeth sweeps across the screen with a splendor and a self-assuredness rarely found in the movies these days. Unlike most historic epics, it has only an average running time. It does not need three to four hours to unfold. It races out of the gate in the first scene and stays on course through its brilliant, mesmerizing finish. It is a film to be savored, and it reminds us that, at their best, movies are truly an art form.
If you are the type of history buff who insists on accuracy, then Elizabeth will disappoint you. Even Shekhar Kapur, the gifted director whose vision this movie is, admits that this is a romantic interpretation of the early life of one of the world's greatest rulers. I feel that, unless a movie's makers claim they are being totally factual, artistic license is as permissible in this medium as it is in others. Besides, it isn't easy to take several years worth of events and cram them into two hours. One has to hit the highlights and be coherent while doing so. Kapur's plan was to capture the spirit and the feel of 16th Century England. He has succeeded brilliantly.
I can think of no young actress other than Cate Blanchett who could have played Elizabeth so well. One effect of modern times seems to be that our emotional growth is slower. While immensely talented, a Gwyneth Paltrow or a Kate Winslett doesn't yet have the maturity to play such a part. The role requires that Blanchett go from an innocent girl, who does not believe she will ever be more than a princess, to an uncertain queen in charge of a derelict, poor country, to an iron-willed, worldly monarch who would make England the world's most powerful nation. Blanchett's portrayal of Elizabeth's mental and physical transformations is acting of the highest order.
Do not think for a moment that this is a woman's picture. To quote Elizabeth, ""I can think like a man if I have to."" There is certainly romance. Her failed love affair with Lord Robert Dudley [Joseph Finnes] is a centerpiece of the movie. Yet Elizabeth is also filled with intrigue, betrayal, deceit, lust, power, and warfare. Scotland was not under British rule, and Queen Mary was longing to invade. Both France and Spain had plans to annex England. It had not been long since Henry the Eighth had broken with the Roman Catholic church, and the Vatican was plotting revenge. It was not the most opportune time for anyone to ascend the throne.
The supporting cast is remarkable. Joseph Finnes smartly plays Robert Dudley as an intelligent but vulnerable character. Geoffrey Rush's Sir Francis Walshingham is someone who is alone in being be utterly loyal to Elizabeth, yet who is also one of the most sinister and ruthless people imaginable. Both of these actors also starred in that other Elizabethan event, Shakespeare in Love. What a year is was for them! And what a year for movies made in the UK!
At the Oscars, Elizabeth was blown away by the delightful and far more commercial Shakespeare in Love; however,at the British Academy Awards, the Virgin Queen won in a staggering twelve categories, including Best Picture and, of course, Best Actress.",1016841600,2,3122,4.751381215469613
1023840,4,6305358591,"Actually,I give this movie 4 1/2 stars. It's not quite Peter O Toole's ""The Lion in the Winter."" But it is not far behind. There is so much to be said for this movie. In today's techno world, where even some Shakespeare movies have given way to Hollywood, this is a masterfully done movie that relies on character development, a superb script, and beautiful scenery as opposed to effects. The movie grabs our attention right away with Bloody Mary's psychotic and ill use of power. Soon afterwards, we see Elizabeth's dangerous state. When Elizabeth survives her half sister and becomes queen, she sees that the game has only just started. She is faced with several decisions regarding her personal state as well as the state of England. One truth this movie reveals is that whatever the faults of her father King Henry VIII were, he was a strong and able king for those hard times. Many people seem to overlook the facts that King Henry VIII (1) Furthered constitutional governing, (2) Authorized the Bible's translation into English, (3) Built up England's navy very well, (4) Kept order in a hard time without any wars resulting, and (5) Satisfied Parliament by removing England from Rome's grip. (When he is spoken of, he is spoken of well.)It may help us to appreciate this movie more if we remember that Elizabeth's grandfather King Henry VII ended The War of the Roses; her father King Henry VIII, pulled England through the Reformation. And Bloody Mary quite undid the fine work of her father and grandfather. And it was up to Elizabeth to fix this. Another thing I must say about this movie is that the violent scenes are done well. Many movies tend to glorify in violence, and to make it worse, they add low humor at the so called 'bad guys' expense. THIS IS NOT THE CASE HERE AT ALL! In this movie, it is clear that the violence is quite forced. It is not delighted in, and there is no low humor involved. Also, our attention is well kept between Elizabeth's personal emotional struggles as well as her struggles to restore England to the state her father and grandfather did. It is very tragic that the simplistic ""Shrek,"" special effects Sci Fi, low humor, no story action movies, or simplistic bood and guts movies tend to dominate the market. Yet this movie which is so masterfully done has a limited popularity.",1016323200,,2326,4.689486552567237
1023841,4,6305358591,"The big-screen movie adaptation of the early years of Elizabeth I starts with the arresting image of a group of preachers being burnt at the stake in the reign of Mary I.  After her death the 25 year-old Elizabeth succeeds her and the movie basically chronicles the queen's loss of innocence as she learns the pressure and pain of being the monarch.
As a history student, this is hardly what you might call historically accurate.  Indeed, the subtext with Robert Dudley is spiced up here.  However, most of this comes to cramming such a monumentous event as a queen's reign into the running time.  This is definitely a historical epic for the 21st century in that it is vibrant and full of intrigue, blood and sex.  This is only too apparent in several memorable scenes, especially the ending, which sees the execution of Northumberland and Elizabeth's hair being shorn off due to her brush with smallpox.  In many ways this is a kind of feminist theatre, with Elizabeth attempting to prove herself to her council, scared of subordination if she marries.  The idea of a woman on the throne was of particular significance at the time, with three queens in Europe - Elizabeth, Mary Queen of Scots and Catherine deMedici effectively ruling France.  If there's one scene which lingers long in the mind though, it's the pillar of strength that Elizabeth is forced to become when the film ends and we see her proclaim that she is married to her people.
Cate Blanchett's performance is extraordinary as her wide-eyed innocence gradually becomes the stern face of resilience.  She turns Elizabeth into a person rather than merely a historial figure.  Fiennes, as her love interest is interesting, with the audience never really knowing whether they can trust him or not.  What's also impressive is the well-realised relationship between Elizabeth and Cecil, later Lord Burghley.  The supporting cast is top-notch, and there's even Eric Cantona thrown in there.
The recent trend in historical epics has been a joy to watch, although there's rarely a central female performance of such power than Cate Blanchett's here.",1012435200,5,2109,4.9602272727272725
1023912,4,6305358591,"Few historical movies have been good enough to overlook the historical fact and just plain applaud the performances and the visual work. ""Elizabeth"" is one of those movies. The performance by Cate Blanchett is just simply amazing, and she should have won more than a Golden Globe for it.

You feel for her in every hard decision she has to make.  A wonderful choice to play Elizabeth.

1023914,2,6305358591,"This film is visually stunning.  The costuming is terrific, the camerawork excellent, the acting superb.  All of that would be the recipe for a superior film-if it wasn't touted as history.
I have watched this movie over and over just to catalogue all the points of history it gets wrong.  It's impossible to write them all in a review here; it would take a full monograph.  The acting is superb but the character portrayals couldn't be further from the truth.
Jeffrey Rush plays Walshingham as the suave, debonair older man who is very fond of the queen.  The actual Walshingham was in fact very sophisticated and learned- otherwise he wouldn't have been a good ambassador in France- but he was also a Puritan who didn't approve of the Queen's behavior and was famous for his run-ins with her (during one of which she threw a shoe at him.)  He did run the most elaborate and sophisticated spy network of his day, but he was not a murderer.
David Attenboro looks very much the part of Lord Burghley (William Cecil) but doesn't act anything like the historical person.  Burghley, or William Cecil, was very careful not to criticize the queen's personal habits.  It was his circumspect behavior that kept him alive during the reigns of three Tudors, Edward, Mary, and Elizabeth.  He was Elizabeth's principal secretary advisor was extremely influential in the decision-making of the queen.  This movie tries to make him look like the straight-laced, Puritan old man who is scandalized by the Queen's peccadillos.  As an illustration of how non-critical the man actually was, he never complained even as the Queen flirted with his son-in-law the Earl of Oxford and kept him away from his wife, Burghley's much-loved daughter, at the expense of her own happiness.
The Queen herself is portrayed by Cate Blanchett as a young girl whose nervousness is quite visible in most scenes.  The real Queen was very strong and very seldom displayed this kind of weakness.  In fact it is said she suffered from illnesses that modern experts say stemmed from the fact that she kept these feelings locked inside.
It would take too long to list all the errors and fabrications in this movie.  After reading 30+ books about the subject I still can't place some of the characters (who was the kid Walshingham (Jeffrey Rush) was supposed to have stabbed early on?)  I can say that some of the situations border on the supernatural (how does Mary of Guise become the matriarch of the house of Valois?  How does she survive so long after the War in Scotland?  Where's Mary Queen of Scots in all of this?)  To sum up, take this movie as entertainment; get your history elsewhere.",1012003200,8,2654,4.782894736842105
1023915,3,6305358591,"This is a lovely movie, Cate Blanchet's performance as the title character is excellent, as is the rest of the cast. The costumes are spectacular.
  As others have noted, this film is entertainment, not history.  The writer(s) mixed fact with pure fancy, and compressed many authentic episodes that occured over 40 or so years into the beginning of the reign.  Walsingham did not kill Marie de Guise, nor did he oust Cecil as Elizabeth's primary advisor.  Robert Dudley was not involved in any murder plot.  I won't bore you with the rest of the laundry list.
  I think it only fair to point out that in my opinion, despite the inaccuracies, the writer(s) did manage to give a fairly accurate view of some major aspects of Elizabeth I's entire reign.  She did use possible marriage as a political tool.  And she was damned adept at doing so.  Elizabeth did have a more moderate religious policy than either of her two predecessors.
The movie is worth watching.  And, if seeing it whets your curiosity, read any of the several popular level biographies of

1023917,4,6305358591,"This baroque offering tells the tale of how the embattled Elizabeth (Cate Blanchett) - a Protestant princess in a catholic court - rose to become the queen of England in name and deed.  The story opens with the impending death of Mary, Elizabeth's Catholic half-sister and the reigning ruler of England. Religious persecution of Protestants includes burning at the stake - an horrific display at the story's start.  Unable to stave death or produce an heir, Mary paves the way for her half-sister's ascension - even as she condemns Elizabeth as a bastard.  Crowned queen, Elizabeth is hardly secure in her position.  With Catholicism dominant, English Bishops side with Rome, Spain and France against her, undermining her authority and preaching against those who would rise to her defense.  Outwardly, they urge her marriage to any one of several suitable suitors - foreign born Spanish or French princes.  On her side, Elizabeth's resources are meager - the kindly but ineffectual Sir William Cecil (Richard Attenborough) , the passionate (perhaps too passionate) Sir Robert Dudley (Joseph Fiennes) and Sir Francis Walsingham (Jeffrey Rush, helping make this look like a ""Shakespeare in Love"" reunion) as Elizabeth's warrior-assassin.  With Papal intrigues linking Rome to the insidious Duke of Norfolk (Christopher Eccleston), and a military threat posed by the formidable French war-mistress Mary of Guise (Fanny Ardant), Elizabeth's tenure seems doomed from the moment of her coronation.  Instead, her headstrong resolve (and Walsingham's clever moves) secure her until she can consolidate her rule.  By the end of the film, already the target of numerous barely botched assassination attempts, Elizabeth emerges corseted and whitened, a virtual living ghost who held the throne for the sake of England but lost out on love and her own security.
This is a great film, but mostly because of Cate Blanchett, who seems regal even when (especially the early part of the flick) when it's clear she doesn't know what she's doing.  She can be funny (telling the Bishops that it doesn't matter which suitor of France or Spain is superior - she'll simply marry both), but never above letting everybody know who wears the crown. Jeff Rush is also great as her Elizabethan-era mentat.  The story however is weak - it seems that Walsingham manages to do what he can because, despite his notoriety, there seems no shortage of victims willing to let him come close enough for the kill.  Elizabeth's consolidation itself culminates in a purge of Catholic subversives led by Norfolk, but that requires some explanation because such a purge would require the sort of substantial support that Elizabeth clearly lacked.  The relationship between Walsingham and the Queen is also understated, possibly because it would complicate Elizabeth's relationship with Dudley.  Still Blanchett carries the film, helped by excellent cinematography which creates an England shrouded in gloom.",1008288000,2,2966,5.29637526652452
1023918,5,6305358591,"It's a tough job, being Queen of England, but Cate Blancett's Elizabeth is more than up to the challenge in this movie biography of one of Britain's most famous monarchs.
Not 100% accurate to be sure, but there's enough here to give a casual viewer an idea of the dangers Princess Elizabeth had to endure while she was literally waiting for her half-sister Queen Mary Tudor to die. This Mary really, really hates Elizabeth, and is about maybe this close to killing her. Lots of other intriguers don't like Elizabeth, either, and they would like to see her destroyed too. Luck is on Elizabeth's side, though, and she outlives her half-sister to become Queen at 25.
The intrigue doesn't end here, though; in fact, you might say it's just beginning. Who will Elizabeth marry? Will the Old Catholics be successful in overthrowing her and placing their own man on the throne? Is there anybody, man or woman, that Elizabeth can trust in this whole realm?
Well, if you don't already know enough English history to answer a few of those questions, I won't spoil things for you. I really enjoyed this movie myself. You get a sense of the perils that filled Elizabeth's every moment. Cate is a marvelous Queen Bess, and we see her metamorphose into the Queen who would be King, because in her time, women didn't count for very much in their own right. The real Elizabeth had often to refer to herself in masculine terms in order to project strength enough to subdue those who would attempt to topple her from power. The shrewdness of the woman is aptly displayed by Cate, and I applaud her for it.

What I find scary is the fact that many people just accept as fact that Mary and Elizabeth were half sisters, when in fact Mary was a threat to Elizabeth and her claim to the throne of England due to the fact that Henry VIII disowned Elizabeth most of her life.  In fact when her older sister, the real bloody Mary, gained the throne, she locked Elizabeth in the tower fom many years.  She appeared to die from some sort of growth such as a tumor and Elizabeth came to the throne when she was 25 years old.  She was one of the greatest rulers of England.

Henry VIII is dead and the country is divided. Catholic against Protestant. Elizabeth is portrayed at first as a woman of the world who takes great pleasure in playful, sensual dancing with her lover. She seems willing to take risks to be with the man she supposedly loves.

After becoming Queen, she takes on such responsibility that she loses herself in her realm of power.

""If you think to rule me, you are mistaken."" -Queen Elizabeth she tells ""Joseph Fiennes"" who was absolutely brilliant in this movie and every woman will just wish she was the one being persued so pationately.

When she is still a Princess, she is accused of treason, this throws her into a world where evil men are consumed with the need for power and cloak their sins in a guise of piety.

She sees the horrors and wants to make one church the rule. This is rated R mostly for violence and a few love scenes which are hardly a minute long. The torture scenes are rather awful and I wish they would have done away with all the heads on stakes, etc. However, they don't look ""that"" real.

Through this movie you begin to really dislike Queen Elizabeth and as her heart freezes, so does yours. I am still wondering what her lover saw in her...she looks rather pasty in that makeup as if with her heart, her face lost all blood as well. ;>

1024004,5,6305358591,"This is a magnificent film with a stellar cast giving award calibre performances. Cate Blanchett deservedly won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Drama. She is truly the heir apparent to Bette Davis and Glenda Jackson, both having portrayed Elizabeth I in memorable performances. Cate Blanchett now joins their ranks with her own incredible performance in that role.
 The movie begins in 1554, in an England that is bitterly divided on the issue of religion. Ruled by Mary Tudor, Henry the VIII's oldest daughter and a devout catholic, protestants are being burned at the stake as heretics, giving rise to Mary's popular name, ""Bloody Mary"". Reviled by her Spanish husband and in poor health, Mary is badgered by her advisors to do away with Elizabeth, her considerably younger, bastard half-sister. This Mary will not do, no matter how pressed. Still, Elizabeth lives her life with the sword of Damocles hanging over her head at all times.
 When Mary dies, Elizabeth takes the throne, no more than a mere slip of a girl wearing the crown of England. Her advisors look to guide her, and she follows their lead, until she determinedly takes control of the reins of power, and follows her own counsel with the help of her most trusted advisor, Francis Walsingham, played to cunning perfection by Geoffrey Rush. With his help, she is able to fend off the ever present threats to her hold on the throne of England, not just from her own courtiers, but from Marie de Guise, Queen of Scotland, deliciously played by Fanny Ardent.
 In the film one sees the transformation of Elizabeth take place. She goes from being a young woman, really no more than a girl, who is in love with Robert Dudley, the Duke of Leicester, dashingly played by Joseph Fiennes, to the commanding woman history would ultimately come to know as the Virgin Queen. Confronted cruelly with the politics of intrigue and betrayal, she learns that to stay in power and effectively lead her people, she must rule with her head and not with her heart. She succeeded brilliantly, leaving a rich legacy that would be remembered as the Elizabethan era.
 This film is an absolute masterpiece. While not quite historically accurate, the film is a broad overview of what happened when Elizabeth first took the reins of power. It also attempts to explain why Elizabeth I would be known as the Virgin Queen. This film is a lush and lavishly costumed medieval tapestry that is woven with great care. It is, without a doubt, a magnificent movie that will hold the viewer in its thrall. Bravo!",998438400,153,2552,4.793181818181818

For those looking for a entertaining production with a romanticized, faintly historical look at her life, then this should not prove to be disappointing.
If you are looking for an truly accurate, complete account of this outstanding woman's life, her times, and the historical figures associated with it, I would suggest Elizabeth R or a good book.  A lot of ""creative license"" was taken in the screen play, making an entertaining production but not a historical drama.

After ridding England of her enemies, she vows not to be the same vulnerable girl she once was; and to make herself an icon to not only her people, but her court.  This sudden shift of personality seems like she is saying ""Noone can touch me anymore.""  I give the film an A+ just for the camera angles, music and actors.

1024007,5,6305358591,"Cinema audiences do not look to Hollywood for an accurate portrayal of anything, much less History. We do not want them to. We want entertainment: the full splendour of magic as woven by intriguing plots, sumptuously designed sets, and an over-indulgence of inspired acting. Nothing less.
The rebirth of Human Thought of the past millenium was ushered into the world fraught with pain and many false starts. History witnessed the end of the Middle Ages three quarters into those thousand years, and although it claims Florence as its embroiled center of emergence, England was certainly one of Europe's greatest proponents of the Renaissance.
One finds an excellent treatment of the ascendance to the British throne of this film's title subject. Shekhar Kapur is an expert magician, carefully managing into a fluid package the steamiest bits of the Queen's early reign, deftly helming the ship round an elaborate and exquisite set, and orchestrating the magnificent cast to a fine-tuned performance. One is offered a musing and attractive interpretation of the famous story, and the result is wholly enthralling.
Chief among its many wonders is its star performer, Cate Blanchett. If not a direct descendant of the Muses, she then comes scandalously close to the claim by steeling the entire show; and it is nothing short of what she, whether by accident or design, is won't to do. She is a fascinating actor. Her credits prove it.  Go to PARADISE ROAD, OSCAR AND LUCINDA, or her contribution to THE TALENTED MR RIPLEY, and it is obvious why she was awarded this role. That she was not awarded the Academy honour is yet another scandal, but we are patient. She shall be granted a place in that stellar coterie, and that with lavish and deserved praise.
Great advances in the Age of Discovery came to the world as brought forth by the English and their Queen.  She was a staunch patron of the Arts (theatre, the fine arts, artisanry), the maritime sciences, and certainly Literature.  By her leave and her purse, the world was bequeathed the jewels of the one of the greatest languages of the West, giving England a proper place in the enlightening advance of the Renaissance.
Look to ELIZABETH, not for the important development of that story, but for a glimpse into how it started.  This telling is as diverting and encompassing a version as the whole tale.",997056000,3,2358,4.917085427135678
1024008,5,6305358591,"I thought this movie was a captivating look at a sovereign queen's struggles and triumphs in Elizabethan England.  The history is loose and inaccurate, but the drama of the movie's own story are sufficient enough to warrant a re watching.  Cate Blanchett shines in the role of Elizabeth with a mix of steely determination and an undertone of vulnerability.  She is at once confident and uneasy, shifting unresisting from the role of a country residing princess into the queen of a death and sex filled domain.
The romance is present in ""Elizabeth,"" but it is pure human emotion that takes center stage.  Her trials and tribulations merit beautifully crafted scenes, complimented by Blanchett's acting and by Shekhar Kepur's allowance of solitary scenes with Elizabeth.  These scenes not only build up her character, but they also allow the audience a peek into the aforementioned vulnerability that underscores her public decision.
""Elizabeth"" is a ultimately a classic drama.  It combines all the elements of drama, with a historic setting and sweeping characterization that at once intrigues and mystifies.  It also has elements of feminism, and if you are so inclined as to enjoy a depiction of a strong woman with human weaknesses, I would highly recommend this movie to you.  I would also highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good biography.  In the end it is a period drama that does not lose itself with a mass of supporting characters, and instead has a heart and soul in the form of its lead actress (which for once truly describes the role), Cate Blanchett.  If you decide to watch this movie, I sincerely hope you enjoy it as much as I did!

1024009,1,6305358591,"I'm all for entertainment, but the appeal of the movie is supposed to be that it (pretty much) really happened.  The movie plot, however, bears almost no resemblence to history.  Of the several glaring inaccuracies, there a few that are so central to the movie that they ruined the movie for me.  First, Leicester (the character played by Joseph Fiennes) was never involved in a plot to kill the Queen.  Why would the movie do this? Second, no matter how hard it is in this day and age to imagine a non-sexually active person, the Queen did not have sex with Leicester and probably with no one, ever.  Besides the fact that she was never alone, it seems she was never to marry or engage in a sexual relationship considering the terrible associations she had regarding sex/marriage during her childhood (including the beheading of her mother Anne Boleyn by her father).  She did enjoy (and demand) the adoring courtly manners shown her by the young men in her court.  And she used marriage negotiations with royal suitors in many countries in order to forge alliances with these countries.  Third, the crux of the film is Elizabeth gazing at a statue of the Virgin Mary and deciding to be like her in the eyes of the world.  Elizabeth was a Protestant and while she abhored the Puritan extremism and was somewhat tolerant of Catholics who outwardly conformed to the Church of England, she unequivocably banned all statues of the Virgin Mary (a Catholic symbol).  The list of innacuracies go on and on but here are a few more:  Walsingham did not travel to Scotland to kill Mary of Guise or Mary Queen of Scots for that matter. The Duke of Anjou portrayed as an effeminate, cross-dresser was in fact the former Duke of Alencon who was not effeminate at all and who Elizabeth once considered marrying, but used his Catholic religion as a pretext for turning him down (and that he was approx. 20 years younger than her) while in reality, she just used the constant marriage negotiations with the Duke and others (Erik of Sweden, Philip of Spain, royal suitors in Austria, etc.)for her political benefit. The scene where the Duke at first meeting Elizabeth whispers that he'd like to see her quinny is hilarious.  He would have been thrown out of England on the spot.

1024051,5,6305358591,"This movie is a masterpiece of historical FICTION.  Do not go in expecting to see a perfectly accurate documentary when you watch this, because if you do, you will be sorely disappointed.  Granted, this is based on real events, but they did not necessarily occur in the order this movie suggests.  If this movie were completely accurate, it would be very boring and unappealing to viewers except for a few not too exciting people.
Instead, watch this movie ready to be moved.  It is a fabulous illustration of the power, majesty, wit and political abilities of Britain's most powerful and famous Queen.  Elizabeth combines sex, violence, betrayal and intrigue, while presenting it in a deep and meaningful way.
In the beginning of the movie we see the young and innocent Princess Elizabeth in constant danger while her catholic sister rules.  Protestant attempts to place Elizabeth on the throne put Elizabeth in great danger.  When Mary dies of cancer, Elizabeth takes the throne in a catholic male dominated society and must overcome plots and intrigues just to stay alive.
Cate Blanchett delivers a spectacular performance as Elizabeth, portraying her caring sensitivity at the same time as her cold and ironic wit.  Her evolution throughout the movie is spectacular, and this performance far outshone Gwenyth Paltrow's in the clich movie that beat this one out for the presigious oscars.  Joseph Fiennes plays Robert Dudley, the Queen's love interest, and plays the part well, but comes off as a somewhat two-dimensional character.  Other notable performances are by Fannny Ardent as the venomous queen of Scotland and Richard Attenborough as William Cecil, Elizabeth's advisor.
Historical discrepancies aside, this movie is an amazing and powerful portrayal of the raw majesty that was Queen Elizabeth.  In my opinion is was just slightly too dark for the academy's liking, and that cost them the best picture.",989712000,,1915,5.165048543689321

Score: 93/100
Elizabeth is like a dream of a movie. It's dramatic, mysterious and fact-based. Not only this, it is the best film of 1998, and it's one of the most amazing Queen movies of the 1990's. Yes, it's that good, an unforgettable and unmissable motion picture event!
When catholic Queen Mary (Kathy Burke) dies the succession goes to Elizabeth (Cate Blanchett), the protestant half-sister Mary was not prepared to execute. The new queen finds herself surrounded by advisors, some supportive but some plotting to restore the catholic line by almost any means. She is also under pressure to marry and produce an heir, but her lover Lord Robert Dudley (Joseph Fiennes) is not considered suitable. Elizabeth realises she has some decisions to make, the most important being who rules England.
Shekar Kupar's film is the first to actually take us back in time and feel like we're in every situation, going through every trouble the character's get into. It's a remarkable thing to feel like you're there, and I have Kupar to thank for that, his direction is marvellous, his effort for this film was astounding. Cate Blanchett's performance is also very unique, the best performance of 1998 by a long shot, she pulls off Queen Mary with power and elegance. Geoffrey Rush, Christopher Eccleston and Joseph Fiennes back her up nicely. The costumes and set decoration are perfect, especially the costumes, which shine brightly and have unforgettable style.

1024056,5,6305358591,"ELIZABETH is NOT a stale historical costume drama.  If you're looking for a movie with all the intrigue of a good Mafia flick and a lead character as fascinating as Elizabeth Bennett in PRIDE & PREJUDICE, see this film!  I've had to go back for several viewings, and I'm as enthusiastic as ever about Cate Blanchett, the script, the cast, the art direction -- everything about this movie just plain works. I think you may find it irresistible.
Cate Blanchett is truly amazing.  A virtual unknown when Kapur selected her for this film, Cate owns the role all the way from the naturally beautiful, frolicking young Princess to the awe-inspiring, white-pancaked visage of the Virgin Queen.  Her expressive face is very easy to watch in all her moods.
I'm not comfortable with the term ""fictionalized"" when applied to this movie because the intent here is not to rewrite or depart from history at all.  In fact, this is a very convincing effort to deduce the methods and manner by which Elizabeth evolved to her ultimate power and glory.  I think they've done a spectacular job of connecting the dots and giving us, at least impressionistically, a look at the likely forces at work.
Again, this is not a costume pageant.  It's young and vital and suspenseful and very engaging.  The movie is lush and beautiful, but the film is all about human beings, motivations, machinations and the stream of life.  Blanchett carries the film along with ease, even in its most difficult passages, and is framed by a great cast as well.  Standouts for me included Jeffrey Rush as loyal facilitator and protector Walsingham, Kathy Burke as Cate's dying sister Queen Mary -- who worries that Cate will champion Protestantism but admirably refuses to execute her own sister without cause -- and the exotically beautiful Fanny Ardant as the conniving and bloody Mary de Guise.
I had to watch the film more than once to fully realize the point that this film makes regarding Elizabeth's re-invention of herself as the 'Virgin Queen' -- she did have a boyfriend, after all.  The dialog toward the end is quite persuasive in this regard, as events force Elizabeth to the conclusion that, as monarch of the people, male companionship can only bring weakness to her country, and so she marries England just as a nun marries the church -- for good (at least, in public).
ELIZABETH is a joy of a movie and I am glad to have it in my DVD collection -- a fine job of rendering by the way and some nice extra featurettes.  Mainly, it is a Cate Blanchett tour de force which establishes her as a major star, but it is also a triumph of the British cinema and an instant classic -- in fact I enjoyed this movie far more than the other period film released at the same time, SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE.  Blanchett in ELIZABETH is a different cup of tea, and much more to my taste.  If you have any remaining doubts about seeing this movie after all the stellar reviews herein, I urge you to take the plunge and find out what everyone is raving about.  You are going to see much more of Cate Blanchett in future, after all.",984096000,,3080,4.615384615384615
1024057,5,6305358591,"""Elizabeth"" embodies the characteristics of truly great filmmaking. Blanchett's portrayal of the young queen is nothing less than astounding.

""Elizabeth"" transcends the less than accurate account of history by creating an emotionally satisfying experience for the viewer. Such scenes as ""Enigma"" with Joseph Fiennes is as climactic as it is chilling. A haunting scene I will not soon forget. Despite all obstacles, ""Elizabeth"" represents the remarkable power of the human spirit. A refreshing and passionate performance. Highly recommended!",983664000,,783,5.87719298245614
1024058,4,6305358591,"""Elizabeth"" is like a dream that will steal your heart away for the duration of its story, and once it is handed back to you, you'll find yourself in utter awe of the events that have taken place before your eyes. It pours on many different elements, those of emotion, intelligence, slight suspense, romance, betrayal, and historical events, all of which combine on a canvas that takes us into the life of a woman who stands out as one of the most successful monarchs in world history. But more importantly, we become so wrapped up in the movie's gossamer feel that we forget everything else and just enjoy it for what it is: pure beauty.
As the movie begins, King Henry VIII of England is dead, and his daughter Mary Tudor assumes the throne as queen of England. At this time in society, there are two sides to religion: the Catholics, who are comprised of the monarchy and the citizens considered loyal to the throne, and the Protestants, who are seen as heretics. Mary's half sister, Elizabeth, is of the Protestant faith, so after her father's death, there is fear in the royal court that the Protestants will try to raise her to the throne. Before Mary is able to send Elizabeth to her death, she herself miscarries a child and soon dies of a tumor, leaving the throne, as well as the turmoiled country, to her sister. She is christened queen, only to discover that her country is in shambles, and that her personal relationship with Lord Robert Dudley is looked down upon by the court. As the plots of overthrowing her position of power begin to thicken, Elizabeth is aided by the help of Sir Francis Walsingham in finding out her true adversaries as well as finding the will to lead her country.
There are so many positive aspects that the movie has going for it; it takes all of this in stride, however, never thinking too highly of itself, which can lead to failure. The story itself is the most intrical of these aspects, handling the history and events in a straighforward and very effective manner. As soon as we are introduced to the character of Elizabeth, we become entranced by her physical beauty as well as her willingness to do what is right by her country. For the most part, the history involved in the movie is accurate, and while their do remain some minor elements of historical liscense, in the end, it does not have as great an effect as the rest of the movie will.
The settings for the movie are absolutely gorgeous, some of the most elaborate ever used in a film. Perhaps this is because they are the real thing, filmed on location in numerous castles throughout England and Scotland, as well as becoming the first film ever to obtain permission to carry out production at the historical York Minster. The intricate sets, combined with the abundant use of dark imagery, all work together in creating the dismal and unforseen atmosphere that is Elizabeth's world. The light and dark imagery is also a key factor, for as the film progresses, there is an obvious transition from the darkness of England to the lighter days of Elizabeth's less-heinous rule than that of earlier monarchs.
The aspect of Elizabeth's personal life is a truly magnificent in the way it shifts when she becomes queen. The movie handles this transition greatly, giving actress Cate Blanchett so many avenues to travel down as Elizabeth begins to realize that once she is queen, her personal life will become public and accessible everyone around her. This has a great effect on the romance between Elizabeth and Lord Robert Dudley, whom she loves more than anything in the world. She soon realizes, though, that the love she holds for him is of a higher caliber than that which she holds for England, and her decisions begin to focus more on her concerns for her country's welfare.
The music for ""Elizabeth"" is quite striking, possessing that same gothic/light feel that shifts with the intended mood of each scene. David Hirschfelder, through his powerful use of vocals as well as strings and ensembles, is able to bring to life the many feels of the movie, from the intense and beautiful romance of the two main characters to the patriotic and wartorn England. I found myself most partial to the music of the royal festivities, especially that of the night in which the boats ride the water, where the music could easily be playing from the shore by the queen's royal court.
There is a high momentum of star power employed here, bringing diversity and grandeur to the film. Cate Blanchett received a Golden Globe award for her portrayal of Elizabeth, giving the title character fire and passion, wit and sincerity. She plays out all of the queen's ambitions and hopes for her reign with true believability, and by film's end, we are left with a stunning portrayal of the monarch. Geoffrey Rush portrays the sinister though well-meaning Walsingham, whose loyalty to his queen is makes for one of the most excellent performances from Rush since ""Shine."" Joseph Fiennes, playing the part of Dudley, is superb as the confused lord who cannot decide what to do about his love for the queen. Richard Attenborough seems the only person fit to play Sir William Cecil, attending to his queen's wishes for her country's rule. And Christopher Eccleston plays the enemy, the Duke of Norfolk, with pomp and piety.
There is a lot at work in ""Elizabeth,"" making it one of the best movies of 1998. We are able to feel sympathy for the historic queen, not only because of the implications of her personal life, but also for the many responsibilities with which she is left to attend to. You'll find yourself moved by the movie's story as well as the character development and interaction, all making the movie rich, deep, and warm as pulsing blood.",982627200,4,5734,4.717846460618145
1024059,1,6305358591,"Driven by a recent bought of the flu to rummage through my video library, I recently watched this movie again.  My initial impression that the film was historical mush was mightily confirmed.

There is no historical reality to the characters, especially to the character of Elizabeth who, by the time in which the movie begins, was already a shrewd and wily politician, who had managed to survive two serious plots against both her brother, Edward VI and her sister, Mary I, in which she was implicated.  she was definitely not a naive innocent, needing complete guidance.  In addition, the damage to such characters as Burghley, who, instead of being the shrewd lawyer and politician in his 40s,as he was, is shown as a fussy, doddering old man, or Walsingham, who in reality was a very sober, strict Bible believing Puritan, and is shown as a homosexual murderer.  Indeed, if I were one of their descendents I would sue the producers!

There is no logic to the plot, which not only telescopes time in the usual manner of historical films (i.e., jamming 20 years into 1, going forward), but even telescopes past into present.  Add to that the dimly lit sets (in which nearly all interiors appear to have been filmed in Durham Cathedral) and the often odd camera angles and any plot rationality is lost, although there was little of it in any case.

The overall effect is one of historical gibberish.  About the best thing I can say is that a handful of scenes are at least somewhat evocative and suggest that the costumers did make an effort at doing the historical research which the writers, director and producer clearly did not.  (This is most prominent in the coronation scene in which Elizabeth's costume closely resembles an illumination in, I believe, the charter of the London barber-surgeons.)",982454400,4,1804,4.827922077922078

Of course, Cate Blanchett is startling and forceful in her portrayal as Elizabeth... expertly reflecting the naivete and loss thereof as Elizabeth matures and undergoes the changes that will facilitate her becoming the Queen of England. Shaping these changes, of course, are the times, but also the characters who populate her life. First of all, Joseph Fiennes character, Sir Robert, appears to be Elizabeth's one and only love, and when she feels that love is betrayed, she takes it to heart and declares that England will be her only husband. This is a turning point, according to the movie, in her life, in which she sees the power and need of deceit, cunning, and also of warfare. Geoffrey Rush is his reliably talented self as Elizabeth's most adept and trusted advisor. (Strangely, of course, Fiennes and Rush both figure prominently in the film Shakespeare in Love, which was released at approximately the same time as Elizabeth. Joseph Fiennes's character may as well be the same, apart from the fact that in one film he is Shakespeare and in another he is Elizabeth's lover. In both pictures he is a man who falls in love with and seduces a woman he should not while married to someone else).

Cate Blanchett's performance however, was impeccable.  She embodied the young Elizabeth suddenly thrown into a whirlwind of controversy that even an elder would find daunting.  Her power and vulnerability were well illustrated.  You could see her confidence grow with every step and you could see her dilemmas.
What I found odd about the movie was that she seemed surprised about the fact the man she was having a relationship with, was married.  Given her position and the prior portion of the relationship, I would think that would not be unknown. Especially, when her relationship continued for a while after she gained the throne.  This may have been a clumsy ""movie"" introduction and not based in fact however.  It just did not seem to make sense.
Additionally, I found the intrigue with the Spanish ambassador very hard to follow.  I never did figure out, what went on there.  Also the handling of the French prince was a joke.  It was so one sided. With so many other portrayals as 3 dimensional this character was rather clumsily handled.  It seemed out of character with the rest of the movie.  It added a light note, but awkwardly.
This movie had so much good acting, but I felt it was not pieced together well.  Maybe a more astute follower of history would find this easier.  However, reading the other reviews, it seems history only played a small part in this movie.

In place of Al Pacino's Michael Corleone, we have Cate Blanchett's young princess Elizabeth, and the movie traces her gradual hardening into glittering, ruthless Queen of England.  Except that the movie doesn't really do this gradually; it foists the change upon us in a series of unconvincing set-pieces.  Early in the film, the Princess is a frolicsome young thang, and it would seem, no virgin.  Joseph Fiennes'  young nobleman is unequivocally her lover.  So far so good, and pointlessly revisionist.  But whatever.  Later she's an imperious young queen who, unaccountably, now spurns her former lover.  (Unaccountable because history tells a much different story.  As a result of too much dramatic license, Shekhar Kapur's film is often rendered incomprehensible.)  At the end, Elizabeth glides across Westminster Hall, apparelled like a really haughty mime.  None of it makes much sense.
Nor does the court intrigue.  I've seen this movie twice, and perhaps I'm dumb but I still don't quite understand the details of the Duke of Norfolk's  (?)  plot to do away with Elizabeth.  There are vengeful monks, poisoned bodices, and Geoffrey Rush's Walsingham, whose role in all this is rather unclear.  And who is Norfolk  (am I getting the name right?)  sleeping with?  Mary Queen of Scots?  Or someone else?  Did I miss something?
There's a gratuitous amount of erotic heat in  *Elizabeth*  coupled with a deplorable lack of clarity.  You know something?  Considering how well-documented this time-period is in English history, I find the lack of concern for historical accuracy pretty annoying.  The fascinating materials are already there; why invent?  For a more absorbing take on this stuff, I recommend the miniseries  *Elizabeth R*  starring Glenda Jackson.",980208000,4,1855,5.268041237113402

Based on the first years of Elizabeth I reign, every moment and emotion is captured with perfection by each character. Although gruesome at times, the story was very true to most historical documents from the time period. The hardship to keep ones throne, and the bias against women is gently, but deeply outlined by the perils Queen Elizabeth is forced to face. With ease, Kapur brings out the reality of Elizabeth and her England.

While watching this film, that's not what I was thinking about at all.  The entire drama is an interpretation of the uncertain early reign of this young, brave queen.  And things have been altered but only to enhance artistically an actual historical time and place.  The way director Shekhar Kapur used his sets, filming his lead characters through grates and red veils, framing each scene so equisitely is breathtaking.  He uses everything around the characters in order to give an emotional charge and electricity to an otherwise over-trodden stale tale of her steady and absolute monarchial power.  And enough cannot be said of Cate Blanchett's performance!  She was delicate and then suddenly powerful, and the way she always has another emotion lurking behind her eyes is marvelous.  You see how these four different men in her life struggle to protect, love, serve, and destroy her.  The relationship between Elizabeth and Dudley is wonderful.  It displays themes of how power, trust, and love coincide. Enough said!  The casting is perfect, the locations are sumptous, and the costumes and sets are lavish and beautiful.

Elizabeth by comparison is delightful if slightly grim at the beginning. It covers the last year of Mary Tudors reign and Elizabeth's succession to the throne. Mary historically was concerned about Elizabeth's succession. Mary was Henry the VIII's first wife and he had left her for Elizabeth's mother. In addition Elizabeth was seen as a person who was committed to the continuing split from Rome. Mary had tried to end the split.  The film deals with the question of whether Elizabeth will survive at all and then when she becomes Queen her fight to have meaningful authority. Geoffrey Rush is great as a highly fictitious intelligent agent.
Kate Blanchett is brilliant in the title role. She portrays well the initial trust that she has with her courtiers something which gradually changes to a steely hardness. She deserved an Oscar for the performance.  Some have criticized the film for playing loose and hard with the truth but it is at least as historically accurate as Shakespeare.",976492800,,1259,4.9904761904761905

In the interest of fitting a full length motion picture in several different incarnations, plus additional materials and programming fun all onto one DVD disc, someone decided that sacrificing video quality was okay.

Digial ghosting, bleed between hi-contrast borders, digital misshaping, all of these classic lower quality MPEG encoding problems show up in this disc.

1024252,4,6305358591,"Most films featuring Elizabeth has focused on the mature queen, dealing with the threat of the Spanish Armada or the problematic presence of Mary Queen of Scots, so a film focusing on the young Elizabeth in the early days of her reign is certainly a worthwhile perspective.  Unlike 1953's ""Young Bess,"" where Jean Simmons' Elizabeth still had to contend with the daunting presence of Henry VIII (Charles Laughton reprising his Oscar winning role), ""Elizabeth"" presents a princess in danger of losing her life and a young Queen whose throne is very much at risk.
Cate Blanchet's performance has more depth than the scenes and dialogues allow.  What probably kept her from winning the Oscar was that she really does not have .  The closest is when she prepares for her speech to Parliament, which was certainly set up to be the moment where she proves her worthiness to the audience if not her people, but the scene does not provide the anticipated payoff.  Nor are there any choice lines that are burned into your mind while watching the film, although there certainly could have been something along the lines that everyone was so concerned with who her mother was that they forgot her father was Henry VIII.  Simply compare the opportunities Blanchet has in this film with what Katharine Hepburn was given in ""The Lion in Winter"" and you will see that this performance in ""Elizabeth"" transcends the limitations of the script.  The supporting cast features such illuminaries as John Gielgu and Richard Attenborough, but it is Geoffrey Rush, Christopher Eccleston and Jospeh Finnes who stand out and give the story its true gravity.
Shekhur Kapur's direction does not stand out as much as the art direction and costume design, which makes ""Elizabeth"" one of the most stunning period pieces since ""Restoration.""  It is rather interesting that for the most part the good guys have traditional bears and semi-flowing locks while the bad guys have buzz cuts, which lend a severity to their appearances.  You do have nice symmetry between the opening of the film where the Protestant heretics are being shaved and the closing sequence where Elizabeth's own hair is shaved as she is transformed into the stunning Virgin Queen.
The DVD offers directors commentary from Kapur that is certainly above average as such things go and a making of ""Elizabeth"" featurette that is actually not as good as the notes in the enclosed booklet.  The film is more emotionally true than historically accurate, but Elizabeth Tudor is one of the most important figures in the political history of what would eventually become the American republic.

And it was this Queen who led England during her reign from near bankruptcy to extraordinary prosperity. The movie is a great movie and it's actually an intriguing thriller. The costumes are just perfect and Cate Blanchett delivers an excellent performance.

The scene where she gets the Mary I (Kathy Burke) ring. Her practicing her parliament speech scene. The scenes she has with Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush). Her ""I am my father's daughter speech."" The scene at the end where she walks to her throne-riveting. She gives an amazingly nuanced and remarkable performance that can not be over-praised. The fact that she lost best Actress is one of the biggest robberies in Oscar history.  Fanny Ardant gives an amazingly real performance as Mary Of Guise. An astonishing example of a small role that is made big by a remarkable performance- 100% Oscar worhty. Kathy Burke is great as Mary I (""Bloody Mary."")Her plea to Elizabeth to uphold Catholicism in England was Oscar Worthy. Geoffrey Rush is ruthless and conniving as Walsingham. His scene where he describes to Elizabeth how she should be seen as a ruler made him deserve the Oscar for best Supporting actor of 1998. Also worth mentioning are Richard Attenborough and Christpher Eccleston.  The direction job by Shekhar Kapur is one of the best of the 1990's and ever. The angles, the close-ups, brilliant. The editing by Jill Bilcock is remarkably done and adds tremendously to the story. The script by Michael Hirst has some of the best lines ever written-an amazing job.

1024256,5,6305358591,"I am somewhat amused at the enraged remarks made by some of the previous reviewers.  If you are looking for factual history, read a book; there are scores of exceptional ones on Elizabeth and her reign. This is a MOVIE, not a historical rendering of Elizabeth's ascension to the throne. And as such, it was made for its entertainment, not factual, value.  Not being a member of MENSA, I was still able to follow the ""plotline"" of the film at my first ""partial"" viewing. I missed the opening sequences, and caught bits and pieces of it on cable before seeing the film in full. After doing so, I was delighted to have found another film I could watch repeatedly. First, the casting was brilliant: I agree with the previous reviewer who felt Cate Blanchett was ""robbed"" of her Oscar. Joseph Fiennes's ""Dudley"" was able to gain my sympathy despite his treachery and Geoffrey Rush was superb as always.  The film's additional casting, direction, costuming, editing and intricate story captivated me. I was not looking for flaws in these areas, or to catch some ""historical mistake."" I was utterly entertained, and was afraid to leave the room in fear that I would miss one ""essential"" line, as the characters were multi-dimensional. If I want to learn, I go to books; I own thousands. When I want to be entertained, or escape reality, I watch a movie.  And that is why ""Elizabeth"" worked for me.  It took me out of my living room into another world, no matter how ""factually flawed"" others found that world to be.  And is it not the purpose of movies to entertain?  I don't think anyone EVER attempted to advertise this film as an accurate, factual portrayal of Elizabeth's reign. But it was good enough to make me want to know those facts, and I think that is the value of movies as entertainment.

1024257,5,6305358591,"As someone who studied Tudor history at college, this may not be the most historically accurate film ever made but the ones that always are accurate are usually pretty boring and really belong on the History channel. This is basically a thriller set against the backdrop of one of the most dramatic periods in European History.
One reviewer mentioned that Stephen Gardiner, the Lord Chancellor and Bishop who rebelled against Elizabeth died 12 years before she came to the throne. Well actually he died 3 years before she came to the throne, but who cares? This was an enjoyable, entertaining film with some superb performances especially from Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush as her close adviser, torturer and Assassin Sir Francis Walsingham.  The film makes some assumptions about her relationship with the Earl of Leicester played by Fiennes but why not?
Braveheart is one of the least historically accurate films about British history ever made but it didn't stop it from being enjoyable and exciting. As a historian I think that if any film makes you want to go to your history books after you've seen it then it has definitely been worthwhile.
Just one correction from what an earlier reviewer mentioned. The Mary's featured in this film were Queen Mary of England, who went mad killing protestants and died making Elizabeth Queen. The other Mary was Mary of Guise who was the mother of Mary, Queen of Scots. Mary, Queen of Scots herself was not actually portrayed in this film at all.

1024258,1,6305358591,"Hardly.  Shekhar Kapur has taken a personality that has fascinated historians and writers since the 16th century, and turned it into an mush that portrays Elizabeth I as weak, vacillating, and completely dependent on her counselors for guidance.
That is not to say there is not good in this film -- Cate Blanchett gives a compelling performance despite a highly flawed script, well worth the Oscar nomination she received.  Geoffrey Rush as Francis Walsingham is cold, calculating, and absolutely determined to pursue the path he feels is best for England and his queen without a thought to the consequences for those around him.
Other actors do not fair so well, however.  Joseph Fiennes, so endearing in ""Shakespeare in Love,"" is wooden and plodding here as Robert Dudley, the man Elizabeth loves.  Richard Attenborough is poorly served with his role as William Cecil, and summarily dismissed from the action halfway through the picture.
You never learn your history from Hollywood, and I do not expect any production to be absolutely historically accurate, but when a director and writer willfully throw easily checked historical facts to the wind -- the bishop shown rebelling against Elizabeth in the climax of the film had died some 12 years previously, before Elizabeth even came to the throne! -- and then brag about how much detail and research has been included...well, let's just say they are being somewhat disingenuous.
""The Virgin Queen"" with Bette Davis as Elizabeth and Joan Collins as a Maid of Honor is just about as accurate as this film -- and a lot more entertaining in the long run!",969926400,4,1604,4.99625468164794

1024348,5,6305358591,"Elizabeth is deeper than might be thought on first blush, and it reverberates, but not with any simplistic answers to the human struggle,  but with uncomfortable questions, disturbing allegations.
Allegation  number one: a woman can rule and be the equal of a man, but she must  suppress her feminine instincts.
Uncomfortable question number one: are  women as vicious and murderous as our ""demonic males""?
What makes  Elizabeth such a wonderful movie is the uncompromising portrait it presents  of a woman in a life or death struggle while in a position of enormous  power.  Notice that she does NOT become a man, nor take on bogus or pseudo  masculine traits to achieve her ends.  She remains a woman to the core, yet  acts with the kind of aggressive, decisive, brutal intelligence usually  assigned to men.
Next question: Is this good to know?
A great work of  art should be content to ask the great questions, not presume to answer  them (but see below).
Cate Blanchett is superb in the title role and  wonderfully supported by Geoffrey Rush and Joseph Fiennes.  Shekhar Kapur's  direction is without a hint of cant or even the slightest pandering to a  mass audience, and is psychologically true and without any presumption to  moral or spiritual wisdom.  There is no preaching or taking sides.  The  script is a work of scholarship fused with the most compelling dramatic  development, climax and resolution.  The editing is almost invisible yet we  can see that exactly enough was cut away while the essence was preserved;  viz., it is remarkable how we are led to experience the political growth of  the young queen and see her take on the attributes of her father, as  necessary, and then see her seek refuge in the church and a kind of piety  as ""the Virgin Queen"" in such a short period of elapsed screen time.  THAT  is film making of the highest quality.
Not enough can be said about the  subtle, charming, expansive, vivid and veracious performance of Blanchett,  yet Joseph Fiennes is to be commended for achieving success in a difficult  and unsympathetic role.  Geoffrey Rush's restraint and control in a part  that could have easily been overplayed was highly admirable and contributed  strongly to the success of the film.
This is not to say that the film is  without flaws.  The scene where Elizabeth discovers the French duke's  homosexuality is unlikely as staged, and her risque behavior with Leicester  not in character.  Better, I think, would have been to keep him frustrated  and allow him only to play at love; however, today's audiences seem to  demand coitus always.  Leicester's dalliance with one of her ladies was  extremely stupid, but in character.  The co-incidence of her wearing the  acid dress as she betrayed her queen was a delicious if implausible irony.  Further it was not made clear how the queen's commands through Walsingham  are made viable so that they must be carried out; indeed the under struggle  among the ministers was glossed over, although her dismissal of the no  longer effective Sir William Cecil was aptly done.
(Of course I can  presume to answer my queries.)  I think allegation number one, that a woman  as a ruler must abandon her normal sexual drive is true, but the argument  is too long for this space.  Are women as vicious as men?  They don't take  the foolish chances that men take, since they can be reproductively  rewarded only by staying alive and securing a stable future, whereas men  can reproduce prodigiously for a while and then die successfully.  But when  necessary, women can be as brutal as Genghis Khan, as Elizabeth  demonstrates.
Is it good to know that women are also vicious animals,  when all the time we would prefer to think of them as fairy tale  princesses?  Well, something's lost and something's gained in growing up;  but, yes, it's important to always keep that in mind when out there in the  big world.  I might add that it is sobering to realize that women as  reproductive animals was not even addressed in this film.  Therein lies  another dimension of femininity that needs exploration...",967852800,,4093,4.844476744186046

The plot  (such as it is) simply covers the first few years of Elizabeth I's reign  & the political machinations of the great magnates who surrounded her.  For someone familiar with Tudor history it is an enjoyable re-creation of a  world glimpsed dimly thru the portraits of Hans Holbein & others. For  those who did not study their English history, I suspect this film might be  incomprehensible. The Dukes, Earls, Bishops & other powerful men who  make up Elizabeth's court are not introduced in any way in the film. They  wear similar hair cuts, facial hair & clothing so as to make them  difficult to identify upon entering a scene. The political motives of those  who choose to support the Pope over Church of England (which was different  from Protestantism) are not shown, nor is any clarity thrown of Mary de  Guise's role. She is simply portrayed as a meddlesome seductress, & the  screen writers seem to have confused her with Mary Queen of Scots (her  daughter).
Of course, Cate Blanchett is luminous as Elizabeth. She  certainly deserves all the accolades that were heaped upon her & it  will be hard to ever picture Elizabeth I as looking any other way. Joseph  Fiennes as Dudley  does not share the resemblance to his historical  counterpart, & I find him too modern to be believable. The interiors  are dark & gloomy, which is a shame as the design seems to be  excellent. It is obvious the director wanted the spotlight on his actors,  not his scenery!
Personally, I found the ending ruined the rest of the  movie for me. It has no basis in history, & does not even seem logical  based upon the script thus far. It is nothing more than a simplistic way to  bring a conclusion where none exists.

Taking place at the inception of Elizabeth I's  reign, you're transported back to Elizabethan England.  We're privy to some  of Elizabeth's most intimate moments, and watch as she grows into an unsure  young girl into a competent ruler, who ultimately becomes one of England's  greatest monarchs.
The acting is superb, save for an over-the-top  portrayal of a middle-aged, ill and hysterical Queen ""Bloody""  Mary.  Cate Blanchett eerily resembles the real Elizabeth, and delivers  what should have been an Oscar-winning performance.  The supporting cast  does an admirable job as well, and all should be congratulated for the  apparent ease with which they endured being attired in Elizabethan-period  clothing!
All in all, the scenery is fantastic, the costumes  breathtaking, the music haunting, and the acting first-rate.  The only  thing which I found annoying is the disregard for real history- which, in  this instance, is even more compelling than the 'fact based fictional  movie'.  Some stories need embellishment; that isn't the case with  Elizabeth's.  Yet despite that, this movie stands on its own and shouldn't  be missed.",964828800,14,1453,5.323008849557522

Yes,  the film is packed with sex and violence, treachery, intrigue, betrayal,  more sex and more violence. Surprisingly, however, this kind of treatment  is necessary to portray the raw energy and brutal circumstances of the  time, and does not really seem gratuitous. I'm sure the historians will  pout about the facts involved, but there is a mood presented here that if  anywhere near accurate is far more telling than who really said  what.
Elizabeth, lucky to live long enough to come to power, inherits an  England that is bankrupt, surrounded by enemies, and under extreme internal  religious strain.  She has to grow up in a hurry, and begins taking  seriously the threats that are being lodged against her (getting pinned to  the couch by a couple of long-bowmen's arrows will do the trick every  time).
I found the most fascinating element of the film the relationship  between Elizabeth and her guardian/mentor, Sir Francis Walsingham.  His  gentle demeanor as her advisor disguises an almost maniacal willingness to  do ""whatever it takes"" to protect her interests.  Elizabeth's  childlike demeanor is a wonderful foil to his worldly-wise  savvy.
Elizabeth, having once dispatched all of ""England's  Enemies"" (read: Elizabeth's Enemies) with the help of her supporters,  is left somewhat adrift.  Walsingham convinces her that the common people  need an icon to worship, so she transforms herself into a sort of living  alabaster Virgin Mary, symbolically marrying herself to the state of  England.  I found that one of the highpoints of the film was actually  reading the afternotes stating that she ruled another 40 years, ushering in  one of England's golden eras, being continuously served by the wise and  faithful counsel of Sir Francis.",964396800,,2039,5.143730886850153
1024356,3,6305358591,"I really liked this movie. However, as some other reviewers have asked: did they really have to rewrite history in order to make it interesting? The answer to that is ABSOLOUTELY NOT! In fact, the real history makes for  an even more enjoyable story than the one portrayed in the movie.  I can't  believe some of the flawed facts that in some parts even degraded the the  plot. Perhaps if I didn't know the real history of the young Elizabeth I  wouldn't say so, but as it is I can't stand some of the changes made to the  actual events when the real events are so fascinating! I think it would  have been more interesting to see into the character of the REAL Elizabeth,  in my opinion the most fascinating person who ever lived, instead of having  to invent a story that was in some places unbelievable. For example, why on  Earth would Elizabeth send her ""most trusted and loyal advisor""  Walsingham to assasinate Marie de Guise when he could be killed? Anyway,  Walsingham was NOT a trusted advisor at all in reality. William Cecil  probably comes closer to this title than anyone else (he was also a bit of  an idiot in the movie, and he wasn't as bad as that in reality, though of  course still not as genius as Elizabeth)
HOWEVER, I do not believe that  this was a bad movie at all. In itself it was filled with good acting and  was an interesting story (even if REALLY boring and diminished when  compared to history). I loved Cate's performance regardless, and that of  everyone else. When I saw this movie I knew nothing about Elizabeth I at  all, and it inspired me to research her, and now I find her fascinating. (I  LOVED the movie at first as well, but as I said, when I knew enough of the  real story I became increasingly dissapointed) I also think that this movie  deserved the academy award. If you are looking for a good movie at any  rate, this is a must see. The only reason I gave it only 3 stars was the  amount of grevious historical errors that I wish had been amended. A more  historical account of Elizabeth's life that is truly excellent (though a  bit low- budget)would be Elizabeth R, with the amazing Glenda Jackson.",963187200,,2148,4.427109974424552
1024437,2,6305358591,"""Elizabeth"" is an example of how movie directors, insensitive to true historical drama, will spend lavishly to create needless fiction.  The reviewer wishes the lavish sums spent on this film could have been diverted  to the much more satisfactory BBC Production of ""Elizabet R.""  But then, that's Hollywood.  Perhaps the costuming deserves some mention  although portraying Norfolk as ""leather man"" is a bit much.  One  also wishes that Joseph Finnes could find a seamstress who can sew on top  shirt buttons, a problem also apparent in ""Shakespeare in Love.""  But then maybe some feel ""grungy"" is sexy, who knows. The  performances are fair on the part of the principals, but in the opening  scene--burning of the heretics--one wishes Bsp. Gardiner would charge the  convicted with ""gross over-acting"" in addition to heresy; but,  alas, he would be equally guilty.  The gratuitous violence and sex is a  sheer pander to modern puriency, not historical accuracy.  There is every  reason to believe Elizabeth was, in fact, a virgin.  There is no evidence  for Walsinghsham's homosexuality.  He was, in fact, like Burghley, a devout  Puritan and Calvinist, who  would have winced at the impication. As a  professor of Renaissance History, allow me to point out but a few of the  glaring historical inaccuracies. 1.  Sets:  Elizabeths and all the Tudors  prefered Hampton Court--a true light, wainscoted marvel, not the dingy  gothic conglomerations more like a cathedral shown here. 2.  Elizabeth was  not shocked to hear of Leicester's marriage to Amy Robsart.  Why should she  be?  She had attended the wedding. 3. There is no evidence that Walsingham  beded or assasinated Mary of Guise, the regent. 4. Burgley remained in the  service of Elizabeth until his death.  He was always her favorite advisor,  and even took his son, Robert Cecil (the future Lord Salisbury) into her  service on Burghleys death.  He was never dismissed. 5. Leicester, Robert  Dudley, remained the queen's favorite until his death.  he was given  command of the army in the lowlands and entrusted with the defense of the  realm in the years of the Great Armada, 1588.  He died in that year,  totally in her favor.  There was never any suspicion of treason on his  part. 6.  Bsp. Gardiner would hardly have called the queen a ""heretic  bastard"" in public.  To do so was treason.  The good bishop was too  much a politician to be that stupid. 7.  Mendoza, the Spanish ambassador  (dressed in what looks like a parody on a torreador suit) never was killed  or assasinated.  he left for Spain, denouncing Elizabeth and encouraged the  later Armada. I could go on..but what's the point.  Americans care little  for history...just schmalz, violence, and sex, and overacting.  This movie  has plenty of the later.

1024441,4,6305358591,"I liked the way this film started and ended. The middle, on the other hand, was filled (at times) with filler. By that I mean obligatory scenes which really lent nothing of major interest to the main story. In so doing,  the film also managed to lose itself historically, so that you had to be a  very well-informed viewer to keep up with who was who and what was  happening and why. I can imagine the director saying to himself, ""I'll make  it an historically accurate piece....No, I won't, I'll make it into a love  story and let the history stand aside a little....On second thoughts, I'd  better keep the history strong....,"" and so on, never really deciding one way  or the other. For a time, it was obvious that the temptation of rewriting  history and according Lord Dudley Robert a greater place than was in fact  his, passed through the director's mind. Shades of ""Shakespeare in Love,""  indeed, where Joseph Fiennes played a somewhat similar role, but one which  was more in keeping with the type of script, if not with the actual  history.
It must have been difficult to avoid giving centre-stage time  to characters like Norfolk and Walsingham. The latter, in the guise (if you  will forgive me for saying so) of Elizabeth's eminence grise, was  definitely overdone. Norfolk, besides acting out of character (I felt) on  more than one occasion, gave up the ghost rather too easily, further  strengthening the reputation of the ""heretic"" living at the queen's right  arm. As for Gielgud's Pope, I think he must have enjoyed every minute of it  (there were about four), but I didn't buy it at all.
I must say I  especially liked the end of the film. After having proclaimed herself  ""mistress,"" there was, in a sense, nothing more to say. The final scene was  very well done. Certainly, Elizabeth the First's subsequent reign was such  that you could make several more movies about it. Overall, the film was  pleasing without being great cinema. For its history, it's of some  interest, but not if you are trying to peer into Elizabethan England for  the first time. You really have to have some background to be able to  appreciate the ins and outs of that particular court. Of recent films  dealing with British royalty, ""The Madness of King George"" and ""Mrs Brown""  were both superior to this, with more depth and fewer unnecessary charades.  ""Elizabeth"" is a four-star cinematic experience, I think, but not a strong  one.",960595200,2,2436,4.742243436754177

It's clear the director wanted to have a  beautiful, young leading lady but liked the skulduggery of Queen  Elizabeth's middle age.  So--he slapped the two together.  The result is a  very muddled account of one of the most fascinating women in history.  Which is a shame, because the real story doesn't need much jazzing up to  make it great.

Although the intent is to focus on the woman and not the  historical pretext, in the end, one is not moved at all by the development  of Elizabeth's character.  She progresses through the disjointed (and  someties pointlessly bloody) plot like a puppet, constantly transforming,  but never actually displaying the greatness one is assumed to be in awe of.  By the end of the movie, Elizabeth has changed dramatically, but has  achieved nothing .
The direction, meant to make a bold statement with its  odd camera angles and rapid fire edits, gives the movie a music video feel  that ultimately detracts from any attempt to take the viewer to a distant  and exotic place.

1024445,5,6305358591,"This is a great examination of life in 16th century England, and the  circumstances that made Elizabeth I one of the greatest monarchs in World  History.  The best part is that we see the young Elizabeth: passionate,  vulnerable, and most of all, human.  Under threat of death by her own  sister, caught up in the English Counter-Reformation of the mid-1500's, and  facing love and marriage issues that would challenge man or woman,  Elizabeth at the end of the film chooses the only path open to her to  secure her throne: to transcend humanity and become an icon...or as to  paraphrase Elizabeth herself, ""to be a reborn Virgin"".  The last  scene in the film encapsulates it, as Elizabeth transforms herself with  chalk-white makeup, a bright red wig, and a spectacular out-of-this-world  costume.  I do have some minor quibbles with the implied dates: the film  gives you the impression that Mary Tudor, Elizabeth's sister, dies in the  mid-1550s, when in reality it was 1558; also, the film doesn't emphasize  her intellectual brilliance as much as it should (and was historically  mentioned by everyone who met her).  But all in all, there's no better film  to illustrate this era in England in an understandable way and put a human  face on a woman most people only know as ""The Virgin Queen"".",957916800,,1299,4.862385321100917
1024446,5,6305358591,"This is a great film, and has about as much connection to reality as  ""Shakespeare in Love"" also starring Joseph Fiennes. However  embellished, the story line is compelling, the action thrilling, and the  scenery -- English.  The cinematography is lucious. The cast is superb.
The thing I find unforgiveable about this film is the rewriting of role  of the Earl of Leicester (Fiennes).  Leicester was Elizabeth's close  friend, and maybe even her lover. Their relationship did not end until he  died. He was her most loyal subject. The truth is more compelling than the  fiction in his case.
Elizabeth relied on Leicester all of his life. She  made him 'Master of the Horse' and he was her closest confidente.  Many  believe his early death was partly owing to her overworking her good  friend.  He never betrayed her, he only wanted to marry her. But Elizabeth  did not trust marriage, and why should she. Her own mother (Anne) and her  cousin (Catherine Howard), were both executed by a jealous husband  --Elizabeth's father, Henry the VIII.
Much of the story line in this  film is drawn from real events surrounding Elizabeth's accendancy to the  throne.  As a protestant in a catholic world, Elizabeth had many enemies.  Some of the extreme dangers she faced are chillingly shown in this film,  although I do believe Mary of Guise, so wonderfully played by the French  actress Fanny Ardant lived a bit before Elizbeth's time.
Cate Blanchett  deserved every accolade she received for her portrayal of the young  Elizabeth. As nearly as I can tell from the historical material I have  read, Elizabeth was a great deal like Blanchett's screen portrayal.
Elizabeth became the ""Virgin Queen"" to her subjects, not so  much because of her celibacy (which may or may not have been a fiction) but  because her people were ""Mary Worshippers"" and needed a diversion  away from their affinity for the Blessed Virgin Mary of the Roman Catholic  church (who some historians believe was used to divert ""pagans""  from The Goddess of the Celtic religion.)
The most visually stunning  scenes in the film take place near the end when Elizabeth dons the white  face paint and jewels seen in the Armada portrait. It is clear this queen  has become a Goddess.",957916800,,2241,4.872340425531915

I doubt that such a  film exists, since everything is in hindsight and re-interpreted.  That  aside it is still a remarkable film.  The visuals are absolutely stunning  -- in particular the coronation scene.

1024573,1,6305358591,"Your verdict of this movie will depend on what you think of the Wong Kar-wai school of filmmaking:  Director first, editor second, actors being the last consideration.
Personally, I can't stand this style of  filmmaking.  Taking only the most superficial of nouvelle vague stylings  (jump-cuts, strange angles, stylized lighting) but applying the techniques  to the most inappropriate material, this ""New New Wave"" tends to  sacrifice the performers and all human qualities for a beautiful-looking,  but dramatically inept piece.
Elizabeth is such a piece.  Given an  actress as strong as Cate Blanchett, just why director Shekhar Kapur  insists on suffocating her performance with endless arrays of camera  trickery is baffling to me.  In this film Kapur shows off a real knack for  missing the dramatic moment.  In almost any given scene, you never see the  decisive moment for a character, and least of all Elizabeth.  Blanchett's  charm and elegance were a joy to behold, and Geoffrey Rush brilliantly  injects a tinge of villainy in his ally role, creating a most interesting  supporting character.  But chances are when you want to see the actors,  Kapur would've either cut to some overblown, poorly performed crowd shot,  or an overhead where you can't see a tinge of emotion, or cut maniacally to  ensure you don't really see the actors.  Some cinephiles may consider this  brilliant New Wave filmmaking; I consider it hogwash, the director  selfishly putting himself on display while sacrificing all of the  characters and story elements.
Cases in point:  We never see Elizabeth  succumb to her council and send troops to Scotland, so her later remorse  (""My father would never have made such a mistake"") is completely  unfounded; her giving up Lord Robert (a watery Joseph Fiennes) is done in  yet another hacked up dance sequence (one of about half a dozen, all  boringly choreographed and poorly edited, going for dazzle instead of  momentum) so her internal change doesn't register at all; Walsingham  (Rush)'s seduction of Marie de Guise (Fanny Ardant, a good performer, also  strangled by Kapur's direction) is ellipsed so when you see her dead, you  know what happened, but there's no impact or feeling of triumph.
The  script is hackneyed, with poor dialoguing and lots of unbelievably puerile  jokes (especially when the French suitor comes to visit).  All this serves  to weaken Elizabeth's character even further, and reduces the narrative  drive of this film to zilch.  There's no build to the plots against  Elizabeth's life and even less suspense.
The greatest problem remains the  direction and its disdain for all things human.  In all honesty, I've never  seen such a great lead performance (Blanchett's) so thoroughly sabotaged by  a director.  For that, I hold Elizabeth in contempt.  I'm all for visual  art and experimental filmmaking, but to completely forsake performance?  And to lose all the sense of period flair (the vomit-inducing jump-cut  sequence of Elizabeth practising her speech, and the fade to whites --  music-video techniques) which all historical dramas need, especially one on  an epic scale such as this?

1024639,4,6305358591,"ELIZABETH is the biography of arguably the most famous monarch in British history.  But make no mistake about it, this is no stately costume drama.  Director Shekhar Kapur, in his English-language debut, makes sure of that.  What we have is a very modern GODFATHER-type epic, set in 16th-century  Britain, whose style reminded me of a toned down version of Baz Luhrmann's  ROMEO + JULIET.
Cate Blanchett is absolutely amazing to watch as she  evolves from innocent youth to hardened political powerplayer.  Geoffrey  Rush is also extremely good as the sinister Walsingham.  Joseph Fiennes,  Ralph's little brother, plays Elizabeth's lover Robert Dudley in this  picture.  Fiennes seems to be a less intense actor than his brother, which  works well for this role.  He actually reminded me of a British Tom Hanks,  if such a thing is possible.  Vincent Cassel as the Duc D'Anjou is a hoot  as well.  The rest of the actors are pretty good, except for the two Sirs,  Richard Attenborough and John Gielgud.  Gielgud's part amounts to nothing  more than a glorified cameo, but he does what he can with the role.  Attenborough, on the other hand, just stands there and says his lines.  One  of the worst performances I've ever seen him give.
The acting is not the  only thing that makes ELIZABETH a delight.  Director Kapur uses many modern  innovations, including using jump cuts for a scene where Elizabeth  rehearses a speech, and the climax, which reeked of THE GODFATHER.  The  subtle cinematography by Remi Adefarasin is both striking and evocative,  and adds to the rich tapestry of the film, especially the sets by John  Myhre and costumes by Alexandra Byrne.

1024642,5,6305358591,"In a year overwhelmed with reminiscent films, Elizabeth rises above the rest to become one of few stunning manifestations of the Hollywood Renaissance. Certainly acknowledged by the Oscars garnering 7 nominations,  Shekhar Kapur's intimate portrait of a young Elizabeth further expands the  modern view on a distant monarch, whose maturing reign as well as taming  nature continued to dazzle the 20th century viewers.
Presented here by  a superb cast led by Golden-Globe winner Cate Blanchett, early Elizabethean  era turmoil and upheavel are captured brilliantly. The lush set itself is a  feast for the eye as the audience is drawn to follow a passionate young  Elizabeth's path.  Against the dark setting of middleval stone castles, a  blooming Golden Age approahces as England expands to take control in a  world of great unrest after Catholic Queen Mary's death.  Her Protestant  half-sister, Elizabeth daughter of Anne Bolyne is placed on a throne of a  kingdom torn between religion.  Cate Blanchett does a fabulous job  capturing the details of a frustrated young woman waking to the merciless  reality of queenhood--surrounded by enemies such as Norfolk (Christopher  Eccleston).  Constantly by her side is her reverent adviser Sir William  Cecil (Richard Attenborough) who advices Elizabeth to marry for convenience  choosing a ""pool"" of ready political candidates--while Elizabeth  herself is long set on her lover from the past Sir Robert Dudley (a  charming Joseph Fiennes).  Yet just as England learns to wake up from the  mideval dream, Elizabeth learns the bittnerness of betrayal as she looks to  Sir Francis Walsingham (Jeffrey Rush)'s counsel.
Focusing on Elizabeth's  subtle changes of phase from fire to ice at a distant in the midst of a  grander panaroma beautifully shot, the audience gradually distinguishes her  footsteps from the shedding of innocence to a tough ruler that dares to  strike first agaisnt her enemies, to ultimately become the Virgin Queen to  reign above all men.",950918400,4,2007,5.319488817891374

Cate Blanchett is wonderful here, the best role I've  seen her perform. The scene where she is preparing to speak before  Parliament is humorous and believable. However, most of the people I know  who've seen this movie haven't understood a third of it, as they knew  nothing of Elizabethan history before viewing the film. I did know  something of Elizabethan history before viewing the film, and I was the  poorer for it, as the glaring historical inaccuracies made it difficult to  sit back and enjoy the ""feast for the eyes"" that the film really  is. If you like period dramas, you will enjoy this movie as long as you are  willing to take it as just that, a story rather than a history. Geoffrey  Rush is great, and some of the minor parts are played very intriguingly.  Take this film for your candy, but look elsewhere for the brain food.",950400000,3,986,4.674418604651163
1024644,5,6305358591,"When I watched ""Elizabeth"" my girlfriend brought up something I hadn't thought much of- imagine, she said, of how difficult things must have been for Queen Elizabeth when she came onto the throne in the middle  of the 16th century given how little society at the time educated women.  The pressures of ruling a country divided at home between Protestants and  Catholics, and menaced abroad by the ambitions of France and Spain, were  bad enough. As a woman, Queen Elizabeth had to endure another difficult  barrier to successfully governing England. That this woman was able not  only to survive, but to thrive and lead England into what many call the  realm's Golden Age, is nothing short of miraculous.
""Elizabeth""  is a film by Shekhar Kapur about the coming of age of what may have been  England's greatest monarch- Queen Elizabeth. It is an exceptional film  about an exceptional figure from history. Cate Blanchett is the title  character and she can only be described as brilliant in the role. Her  character goes from terrorized to uncertain to confidant, from a beautiful  and vibrant young woman to a cold and cruel Queen. Blanchett pulls off the  performance in spades. This is an actress with some serious talent.
I  also enjoyed Geoffrey Rush's performance as Elizabeth's loyal advisor. Rush  is a talented actor (""Shine"", ""Shakespeare In Love"")  who pulls off the part with relish- cold, menacing, calculating.
I found  the dark conspiracy against Elizabeth that dominated the second half of the  film took away, somewhat, from the overall feel of the film. The second  half of the film is, to a certain extent, Rush's film. This is not a bad  thing, mind you, but the second half of the film leaves Elizabeth reacting  to events more than initiating them. Casting-wise Joseph Fiennes and  Richard Attenborough turn in good performances as Elizabeth's lover and  principle advisor.
""Elizabeth"" is, on the balance, an amazing  film about a difficult historical figure to pin down. The strengths of this  film are in its two leads- Blanchett and Rush are both outstanding. See  this movie for their performances alone.",950140800,,2130,4.994301994301995
1024645,3,6305358591,"The enormous support for this film in the press, Academy and other Awards is a further indication of how starved contemporary movie going audiences are.
Don't get me wrong, I liked the film well enough, but was extremely  disappointed nonetheless.
There is little reading anymore and the  quality of education is diminishing. It is my expectation that visual media  like film and TV should take on substantial roles in providing historical  information to those who might otherwise be ignorant.
I knew little of  Queen Elizabeth prior to my viewing this film, and knew only minimally more  after I had finished. The production design and costuming, while  interesting and possibly accurate (who really knows) left me not knowing  who was whom and where was where. It is the responsibility of the  filmmakers to keep us IN the story,  they failed miserably here. Had I an  advanced degree in European history perhaps my reaction would be rabid,  instead of  tepid.
A few directions, some simple titles, narration,  or  background exposition, would have helped immensely. Somehow I feel the  filmmakers believed themselves to be above all that drivel, proud  to let  us stumble along, continually uncertain as to who was whom, and which side  was which. It's the arrogance of Kenneth Branagh-style filmmaking.
Cate  Blanchett as Elizabeth is good in the same way John Hurt was a good  Elephant Man, again, who really knows?
We certainly don't need another  Kenneth Branagh, a man who pompously makes costume dramas without regard to  any sort of audience involvement, preferring to throw his ideas and images  at them, catch if catch can, like a rich man throws pennies to a beggar.

She is, indeed, just a shell, and Cate Blanchett brings the Queen to life;  she takes us from the early days of the vibrant and delicate velvet glove  to the often ruthless ironfist, delivering what I feel as the best  performance for an actress in a leading role for 1998.  There is  outstanding support from Rush, Attenborough, Eccleston, and Fiennes.  Filled with lavish costumes, an exhilarating soundtrack and exceptional  cinematography (near the beginning, the camera revolves around Elizabeth  intimidatingly as she is questioned, as if we are also in the conspiracy to  get rid of her), ""Elizabeth"" is a sensational, epic masterpiece.",949276800,,1065,4.78021978021978
1024740,5,6305358591,"I am not exactly a fan of royalty, but I liked and have great praise for this film.  I even had the feeling that, perhaps, The Academy of Arts and Sciences should have preferred it over  ""Shakespeare in Love"" for their  Best Picture Oscar Award, or/and, not just nominate, but elect Cate  Blanchett as Best Actress Ex Equo with Gwyneth Paltrow !
After all, both  films are made in the (US/UK) English continuum, they walk us back in time  to the same Golden Age of Queen Elizabeth I, they even share performers:  Geoffrey Rush and Joseph Fiennes.  Admittedly, ""love conquers all"" - we all  empathize with lovers and a love story - but I believe it is Cate Blanchett  the one who has a much greater burden: ""becoming"" the Queen of England  !
Blanchett is convincing as the young 25 years old Elizabeth, daughter  of Henry 8th, who, ""on-the-job"", and upon advise and help from trusted  friends develops the maturity, experience, and sophistication absolutely  necessary to play the role she was meant for:  the greatest woman monarch  of all times.  Geoffrey Rush, playing Sir Francis Walsingham is equally  convincing as her mentor, shrewd diplomat, and effective ""secret service""  agent.  The conflict with the Church subordinated to the Vatican, the  complicated and never predictable ""political dance"" with neighboring  ""superpowers"" of the time, Spain and France, the more predictable conflict  with men, such as The Duke of Norfolk, the costumes, the music, dances, the  decoration - all are exquisitely laid out in front of us ! Blanchett brings  to life, Elizabeth, a  woman who has her own passions and more or less  secret lovers (Robert Dudley Earl of Leicester, played by Fiennes - better  performance opposite Gwyneth Paltrow), but, when she says ""I am queen now  !"" she realizes she can never surrender (authority, control) to anyone, and  has but one spouse:  England !

1024812,4,6305358591,"This was easily the best cast film of 1998, perhaps of the decade.  Blanchett's Elizabeth is every bit as complex and, in the end, interestingly enigmatic, and a bit tragic, as was the historic Elizabeth I.
Those who complain that this movie is filled with historic inaccuracies  miss the CLEAR intension of the movie to be a pastiche, a tableaux, an  impressionistic look at Elizabeth I's rise to power.  (Notice how the open  credits suggest tableaux, and the rather hard edits between scenes lend the  movie, slighly, a quality of a collection of scenes, not necessarily meant  to be tightly woven together.  Also, for those who know their Church  history, the opening scene sets the impressionistic interpreation the movie  follows by dressing the Roman bishops in ALL black, even their mitres.  No  such liturgical vestment has ever existed, even for Requiem Masses...the  Roman Church, in this movie, is The Bad Guy, and its representatives are  costumed accordingly.  This is not an historical mistake, it is an ARTISTIC  CHOICE, and it works.)
Geoffrey Rush's portrayal of the historical  Lord, advisor, and protector of Elizabeth I is subtle and utterly amazing.  And the writing helps developes the character well, too.  Lord  Wallsingham's homosexuality was rather an open, albeit quiet, secret w/in  Elizabeth's court.  It was also why he was trusted until the very  end...Elizabeth knew his heart would always be unclouded by the various  matrimonial schemes surrounding her and drawing in many of her other  advisors.  Thus the movie's clever and subtle consistency in first showing  Rush's character in the company of a young man (in a bedroom), then showing  him w/ another young, attractive man who works w/ him as an apprentice spy,  and finally sending him off to engage with Mary of Scots in a way one could  hypothesize a heterosexual man might be less able to.  (I am vague in order  to not give away too many surprises.)
This movie is a feast for the  eyes.  It is dark, to be sure--black costumes, torch-lit corridors, and  scenes at night abound--but, again, these are good impressionistic choices  that set off the BRIGHT moments in the movie during which Elizabeth's early  innocence and later power are communicated.  I don't give this movie a full  5 stars only because of what were, I feel, some very poor decisions  regarding the soundtrack (Mozart's Requium and Elgar w/in the same crucial  scene! ) and a handful of spots where the pacing could have been picked up.

Thanks to Kapur and  Cate Blanchett (whom I've loved ever since I saw a schmaltzy drama called  Paradise Road), Elizabeth is brought to life with grace and vigour.  Some  might say Kapur's direction is too fancy (William Goldman complained he'd  never seen so many actors wasted by showing only the tops of their heads)  but I think it's creative and breathes new life into period filmmaking.

In his histories -- Richard II,  Henry IV parts 1 and 2, Henry V, Henry 6 (three parts), Richard III, etc.,  Shakespeare changes events for dramatic purpose. He tries to capture the  overall sweep of events and examine the important issues, while telling a  good story. At the same time, he moves events around, changes the ages of  characters, compresses things in time -- in short, all the same things that  the makers of Elizabeth did.
 Elizabeth is a fine film, capturing the  feel of the time, and getting the overall issues right, even if it changes  the details. The performances are wonderful and the production lavish.

With that in mind, I thought Cate Blanchett was great in this movie and her supporting cast did a superb job. Script had a ""Godfather"" feel to it, especially at the end. Don't look to this film for any historical insight. There is none. But for good simple entertainment, the movie is good for that. Otherwise, this is a great Hollywood  film, much like the other ""historical fantasy"" film - Braveheart.  Within the context of the film, Elizabeth is one of the best of 1998.",927417600,,706,4.543307086614173

I truly believe that the Oscar should have been won by Cate Blanchett due to her miraculous performance of ""Elizabeth"", at least she did win a Golden Globe award for best  actress in a drama.  After watching her portrayal of ""Elizabeth"",  I could see why the Elizabethan era was considered one of the best period  of England's history, England had a very strong leader.  For those who have  seen the movie, I was amazed at how Blanchett at the end of the movie  resembled the paintings of Queen Elizabeth.  I had always believed that the  old paintings were exaggerated, now I can see where it came from.  Bravo to  Blanchett for doing such a remarkable performance.  I can't wait to see  what other roles she has played.",926726400,,757,4.511111111111111

1025206,1,6305358591,"Cate Blanchett's performance is as stunning as the historical trashing of the much beloved Virgin Queen Elizabeth. Undeniably, it is another defilement of a great historical leader that rallied her forces to keep  England a sovereign nation and the richest nation on earth at the time.  Nothing in this film, except the lurid and languorous travails of Hollywood  scriptwriters who cannot present something worthy to a public only  interested in steamy sexuality, is close to the truth. Elizabeth was a  bold, visionistic, and cunning woman married to her people and a staunch  defender of the realm. The American public's appetite for sexual impurity  in cinema is obvious since we only see a woman naked every fifteen or  twenty minutes. Exactly what does the sexual perversities of this age have  to do with a great Monarch? Absolutely nothing. No offence to Amazon.com  but this trash deserves no treatment except extreme disgust by the ignorant  to glory in its travesty of inaccuracies. I am incredibly surprised to see  Sir Richard Attenborough take part in making this debauchery of film. He  should know better and the American public's appetite for trashing cinema  has gone to far. Soon we will be parading Mary Poppins as a cavorting  w***e... Elizabethian history suggests ABSOLUTELY no substance to the  audacious claims she was a wild young woman before dedicating herself  completely to the throne. Only Sir Francis Drake (I believe) may have been  an actual lover. Get real Hollywood and stop trashing people in an Oliver  Stonian tradition just to make some money and satiate the sick lust for sex  of the American public. The film was incredibly well-made but lacks any  authenticity or truth which...is the reason we make such films in the first  place. Watch Elizabeth R for some real truth and a piece of history.  Otherwise, just watch this for erotica or, should I say, cheap and tawdry  sex defiling a Queen of Majestic Glory. I'm sure no would do this to a  virtuous woman like Mary Todd Lincoln. Well, perhaps.....

I purchased Elizabeth from a seller who wrote that it was ""background for teaching Shakespeare."" No wonder our schools are in trouble! When the goal is to feel rather than to understand or to think (which is easier, after all?), educators (I blush to own that I am one) imagine that Hollywood is an authoritative guide. I suppose my seller's goal was to get hormone-crazed students to believe, ""Hey, the Elizabethans are just like us!"" This is itself an American conceit which keeps us from actually learning how other people are different.

Not that the movie Elizabeth contains any inaccuracies. I did not notice any per se, but one had to be a scholar to recognize them in a movie whose chief interest is in the sensual. And this is where the movie may get all the facts right but the message is very wrong. For the Elizabethan age was an age of ideas; Elizabeth herself was a scholar; people's personalities were determined by their ideas and commitments (their character) rather than by superficialities of sex appeal. But this latter is really the chief interest of the movie.

Having said as much, there are many strengths to Elizabeth. Cate Blanchett's award-winning performance has much to command it. Her transformation into the ""Virgin Queen"" at the end I found disturbing as only the well-acted development of a role can disturb. Richard Attenborough's character conveys loyalty and dignity sadly lacking in other characters. Whereas great drama features the clash of dignified antagonists, Hollywood often portrays the good guys (Elizabeth & friends) against the bad guys (French, Spanish and Catholics who sleep around).

I love period piece movies for their sets and costuming, and this movie is no exception. The nobles and ladies are beautifully appareled, and the high ceilings of renaissance (actually medieval) castles and cathedrals are used to great effect. Shots of Elizabeth's palace are dominated by a colossal pillar and other impressive stonework.

Except for a Thomas Tallis Te Deum at the coronation, most of the music in this movie is Beethoven or later, music designed to help you feel the passion rather than understand the period.

Movies, like history, move us because we identify with characters. When Princess Diana and Mother Teresa died in the same year, millions identified with the glamorous, jet-setting Princess whose commitment to herself rather than to the institution was applauded; somewhat fewer identified with the self-effacing, self-sacrificing, wrinkled nun, devoted to a cause bigger than herself. In a day when patriotism is unpopular, religion and those who take it seriously are ""problems"" to be dealt with, and looks and popularity are everything, ""Elizabeth"" is the great queen repackaged for our time.",1524009600,,2806,5.165198237885463
