8109900,5,B000EHQUPS,"I purchased this DVD twice, as anniversary gifts, for my parents' and my sister and brother-in-law. I have sent many DVDs over the years. And my parents said that ""Europe to the Max: Hidden Treasures - Romantic Germany and Beyond"" was the nicest DVD that I have sent so far.

My parents really enjoyed the part in the film on Prague ""Die Goldene Stadt"" [The Golden City]. My mother shared with me: Sometime after WW2, my Opa wished to take my Oma to Prague for their anniversary. But his dream to visit the heart of Europe with her never came true. And it was nice for my mom to see just how beautiful...

My parents said the film showed so many beautiful places, all in all. They enjoyed the entire film from start to finish, especially loved Germany's Romantic Road and Wrzburg, Croatia (Dalmatian Coast), and Hungary. It was a quiet, cold winter's day. And this DVD really made my loved ones' day! It was a perfect anniversary gift!",1514678400,,935,4.5266272189349115

8109904,4,B000EHQUPS,Rudy Maxa is a great commentator for his European DVD's.  It's almost like being there.,1409443200,2,87,4.8
8109905,5,B000EHQUPS,"Beautiful scenes of cities and countryside make you feel like you're there.  Very informative presentation by the host, given in a soothing and relaxed style.",1384473600,2,158,5.32
8109906,4,B000EHQUPS,I have bought DVDs from both Maxa and Steves and find both to be pretty good.  If I had to pick one I'd probably recommend Max as Rick Steves can come off as a bit boring nearing grating after a couple of hours.  Steves books are thorough however and make for a good source (though Karen Brown's are the best for quaint inns and travel itineraries).,1180569600,6,349,4.2727272727272725
