8085386,5,B000BD1LIQ,"A 1948 DVD of the famed San Diego ""Hollywood Theatre"" Burlesque Stage Show.  The last Burlesque House to survive on the West Coast.  I visited the show when I was in the Navy in 1960.  A few years after that and the show was gone; the Theatre was demolished.  This recording is a nice tribute to Burlesque when it was ""naughty but nice""!  The comedy was good although not quite the standard of Abbott and Costello, the girls were young and appealing.  A mild show by far compared to today's movies!  Certainly a great attraction in wonderful San Diego back in those days and a must see by every young US Navy Sailor stationed in the area.

The ""Peek-A-Boo"" footage was taken in a Los Angeles theater and is a bit raw. The comedy punch lines are deleated in the skits.  If you've never seen a genuine tassel twirler, heres your chance!  Elaborate scenery and staging, some of the ""girls"" had to be kicking 40 around!  A fine Adagio Team is featured in the show.",1360540800,4,960,4.428571428571429
