7954742,5,B00005UM2H,"This is one of the best Blues concerts I have seen, and I am not necessarily a huge BB fan, but this is great. BB plays lots of great solos, the band is good, the picture quality and camera angles are good, the sound and mix are good and BB's singing is tops. I can't highly recommend this enough. The only criticism is that it is short but if that's all there was, that is all you can get, and I'd rather have a short great concert than a longer mediocre one. A must for Blues fans.",1292889600,,483,3.9896907216494846

7954744,5,B00005UM2H,"Though it is less than an hour long, it is worth it.  I have seen him live 5 times, and watching him back in the 70's is just as good as all the shows I have seen live.  The usage of his Major, Minor, Major Pentatonic, Minor Pentatonic, Myxolidian, and Arpegio scales brings a tear to my eye.  A tear of joy and fasciation.  Every blues enthusiast should own this DVD.",1028764800,6,368,4.140845070422535
7954745,5,B00005UM2H,"Excellent, albeit short(~48 minutes), live performance during the 'Rumble in the Jungle' promotion.  BB is in great form with a large backup orchestra playing some of his classics.  Great riffs and soulful singing leave you wanting more. See a younger B.B. King in his prime, with glimpses of Don King and the real king of boxing - Ali.
If you already have the ""BB King Live in Africa"", then you already have this DVD.  Same company, same Dolby 5.1, different title and package.",1026172800,10,478,4.734939759036145
7954746,1,B00005UM2H,"I have not viewed this DVD but it looks just like the BB King Live in Africa DVD that I do own.
Both even mention ""If you look close you can see Ali in the crowd"".
The reason I gave it 1 star is because it looks like this is just re-issued with another name. If that is true it's [not woth it]. If it's not true just let me know what's different.",1018310400,3,346,3.7534246575342465
