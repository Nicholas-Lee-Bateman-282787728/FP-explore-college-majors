8176199,5,B000NA254Q,"Perhaps more dramatic than the actual accounts from my relatives who lived through it, but so gripping and basically factual.  I would have liked to have seen attention to the impact on children who are now my age, grown with their own children and grandchildren....It would have also been good to have some knowledge of the years in Denmark in Displaced Persons' Camps before being able to return to Germany.  I am continually astonished at their resilience...having lost everything and having had such an abundant life in West Prussia (Poland)...then living 8-10 people in a room in a Displaced Persons camp for years and finally being given housing in Germany.....and the children are now doctors!  lawyers!  architects! bankers!  What a testimony!",1457308800,5,751,5.1735537190082646
