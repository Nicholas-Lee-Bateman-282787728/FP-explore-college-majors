5724643,5,B00CKWI13O,"This blu-ray disc (also the package contains a DVD) is known to be the reference for calibration and evaluation of home video systems. It's easy to use, but you need to read the documentation to know which patterns and where are they located on the menu. An improvement could be a way to see a small preview of the patterns direct in menus, but also that option would complicate navigation. Also, it's a pity that this disc is not supported directly in the display calibration applications, but can be used in manual mode.",1371081600,4,522,4.623655913978495

It is very easy to use and showed that most (but not all) of my Sharp's settings were very close.

After I was done I put in a UHD movie ""The 5th Element"" The picture looked awful. I ended up returning the settings back to the original factory settings and trying the movie again, it was 1000 X's better. I guess this disk is not meant for my type of tv or maybe the OLEDs are pretty close to perfect right out of the box.",1518048000,2,576,4.236363636363636

5724654,5,B00CKWI13O,I just purchased this spear and munsil calibrator disc and ran through the setup and my TV looks like I ran out and bought a TV that was  more expensive the colors really pop.  the setup was very simple and the instructions were very easy to understand. I would recommend this to anyone that has a home theater or anyone that just has a TV because it makes a world of difference. When you get to contrast and the black levels right it makes all the difference in the world. if you buy this disc you will not be disappointed I know I'm sure not. Spear & munsil calibrator disc are a a definite winner,1517097600,,599,4.2
5724655,5,B00CKWI13O,"I've had a 4k tv for almost a year now and never could figure out why it didn't look as spectacular as it did in the store before I bought it.
At first I thought it was the lighting, then the sources.
Eventually I settled for the vivid settings and called it a day.
While playing certain video games i noticed the picture would be washed out or too grey where it was supposed to be black.
Other issues I had were some areas were too saturated and some movies had a lot of pixel noise in certain scenes.
A friend mentioned Disney's world of wonder and after seeing the price tag opted for this as it also had a high rating.
While I understand Disney's calibration disc is more in depth this gem helped me get the most out of my 4k tv.
I'm noticing super sharp details in certain games and movies I didn't notice before and all it took was fixing the brightness and contrast with this disc.
I immediately calibrated my computer monitor as well since I do a lot of Photoshopping.
Definitely worth buying.",1516924800,8,1001,4.301587301587301

5724658,4,B00CKWI13O,"I calibrated the video then tweaked a bit more to get a better picture. I learned a lot from this process using the S & M Benchmark. Wow, my 2008/2009 Toshiba 52RV535U is a much better TV than I realize. I think I will sell my Toshiba for more money because of that and after I calibrate and approve my new 4K UHD 930E.
The sound calibration is OK if you don't have a calibration app on your receiver/amp/AVR. Otherwise it is of not much use.
I wonder if a 4K calibration would be better? Of course there aren't any out yet. Of course Disney might do one for $$$$.
Update 12-11-2017:
I find calibrating my Sony 65x930E a bit more difficult using the S & M disc. The 930E has more adjustment settings to drive you bananas. You know something is wrong when everyone is wearing fluorescent lipstick. Time to rethink. Not done yet. This calibrating isn't paying me enough.",1511308800,,868,4.39751552795031

5724663,4,B00CKWI13O,"I think it's very useful to have. Before this disk I had problems tuning contrast and brightness to perfect levels.  There is a 'sweet spot' that I would never be able to get without this disk, since brightness and contrast are closely related. Just make sure you turn off all auto settings. I had halo effects and bad shadow artifacts. This disk solved the problem, or at least minimized the issues.  The blacks now have shades of black instead of just a black shadow. It doesn't take long to go through a basic tune up either. Not if you're used to how it works. It has 5 or 6 basic calibration screens that tweek the most basic settings:  contrast, brightness, color, tint, sharpness, and color temp, and color base.  I think it's a must have for every person who wants the best TV picture. It does some advanced video and audio calibration too, but those are 'pro' settings that most people would never touch unless your a big videophile.  My only complaint is that there's no way to adjust the back light setting on the TV.  That setting is more suited to room ambient lighting and personal preference.  So it's not going to be able to calibrate all your settings.",1502755200,3,1169,4.538095238095238
5724664,4,B00CKWI13O,"I had the previous edition of the S&M disc.  This new version is far superior and included the 3d calibration which I did not expect.  I bought this to calibrate my new LG OLED 4K TV.  I accomplished that but the disc does not address OLED light which is a setting that must happen first. So I had to pick an arbitrary setting based on web research and go from there.  However the results were striking.  Played some 4k source from Netflix and thought I could reach out and pet the leopard, if one does that.  Still have to do the 3D.  Gave it 4 stars because no OLED light setting, (that I can find anyway).  Other than that very happy with result.  Getting the OPPO 203 and will go through it again once I have that.

5724667,1,B00CKWI13O,I found this to be worthless. There is no explanation of how to use it to calibrate picture and I have spent many years in the motion picture industry as a producer and director. Nothing intuitive about it at all. I finally calibrated my color settings by calling Sony and asking them for a complete set of settings. That worked great.

5724672,4,B00CKWI13O,"Received the disc on time and in perfect condition. Popped it in our Samsung UBD-K8500 to calibrate our LG OLED65E6P and let the disc play for 15 minutes while reading the manual, as it advised. When it came time to start the calibration, I immediately became confused. Reading the manual alone led me to believe that I needed to make the adjustments through the UHD player. After spending nearly an hour trying to figure out how to do that and getting nowhere, I went to the Spears & Munsil website which states they recommend using the TV's settings. I'll have to check the manual again, but I'm almost positive it specified using the player.

Anyway, once I figured this out I was on my way to calibration. It took me around an hour to complete the basic steps, and I believe the picture is better than the settings I originally made just using the eyeball test. I've since made additional adjustments because I found the image a little dark.

Later today I'm going to reset everything, start from scratch, and attempt to complete the more advanced sections, including the 3D one. I'll update this review once I'm finished. Either I'll be completely satisfied with the results, or I'll shell out the dough for a professional calibration.",1492819200,5,1240,4.736111111111111

5724674,5,B00CKWI13O,"Is a bit time consuming process but it made a huge difference in the color and contrast quality compared to how the TV was set out of the box.  That could be due to a number of factors such as how one sees colors compared to someone else and the lighting in the room will have noticeable effect.  My TV has multiple video profile settings and so I set one up for daytime, night time with lights on and night time with lights off.

5724692,1,B00CKWI13O,"Having used other video calibration disks before, I have to say that this Spears & Munsil HD Benchmark and Calibration Disc 2nd Edition isn't worth the plastic it's encoded on. There is basically no real information, and the set-up is non-technical as possible by removing any indication of what you're actually trying to achieve. The few calibrations they have you work through are basic at best, and color calibration is like nonexistent. 3D Settings are very confusing and will not help in making best of it.

5724693,4,B00CKWI13O,"I find that this product's basic settings are better than the THX optimizer that came with several DVDs that I've purchased in the past (and certainly better than the THX iPhone App), especially for sharpness.

I imagine that the TV's factory default setting for sharpness is the average from where it needs to be if you're viewing a bluray (1080) or watching tv (720). I found that the sharpness for 1080 needed to be decreased and the sharpness for 720 needed to be increased from the factory setting. I discovered this by setting my bluray player's output to 720p. Both bluray and tv watching have improved!

Maybe I didn't do enough research on this product but I was hoping that I'd be able to use this product possibly in combination with my HDTV's red, blue, and green filters to correct the saturation, tint, and luminosity of my TV's color space management. That's just not the case. You still need to get a colorimeter for that.

5724718,4,B00CKWI13O,"I thought this was gonna be great.  But the dolby digital set up that comes with some dvds as special features are actually just as good, but here they give you the glasses to make sure the blues and magentas are correctly displaying.  They need to work on back lighting and brightness more, separating the two better in the tests.  Back lighting, I found, was not covered very well anywhere,  So to make the most of this setup, I'm going to give you some pointers...
1. First, set your devices, both the player and your tv too, on cinema or movie mode, and leave them there.
2. On the player, use enriched and enhanced rgb settings.
3. Back lighting: On the tv, have a wide screen movie on with black bars on the top and bottom.  Now, make sure you have a dark scene on pause, so that you can match the dark bars with the black parts of the movie.  Set your back lighting to lower settings until you dim the dark spots or shadows in the scene down to equal or just below equal darkness with the black bars showing on top and bottom of the paused movie scene.  Now play it a bit and make sure the bars are the same or the tiniest bit darker than the black scenes and shadows in your movie.  Now you have your back lighting set up right, and everything will be easier to set up afterwards, and it will extend the life service of your tv's screen.
4. Go directly to the cyan blue/magenta test.  Use your glasses.  My tv had to have the glasses folded twice, as the disk warns you for some tvs, and it worked really well.  My color settings were not red enough.
5. Brightness.  Now is the time to set your brightness levels.  Make sure you can see all the details of the squares.  It may look dimmer, but trust me, your eyes will thank you for it later, as it not only spares the eyes from seeing a glaring screen at full blast, it helps them to see sharper details in the pictures and videos easier, which also reduces eye strain, and actual headaches.  (P.S. I researched the crap out of this just to get my tv looking like the older model lcds did.  I miss that tv. Next...
6. Sharpness and contrast.  You can not, in any way, set these independently.  One will always affect the other.  Let us first set Sharpness and contrast both to 0, zero, yes, zero.  Why?  Sharpness is an artificial way to make edges look sharper by adding angles and lines to the picture.  If you have an hd tv, then each pixel the tv is sent, is already on the disk.  If it is a high quality movie, then each dot is already set at its proper appearance.  However, that being said, not all films are that great, even blu-rays, so it does help to up the settings a bit.  After we set sharpness and contrast to zero, We find a scene in a movie that is well lit, where you can see a face close up, or better yet, an object, such as a stone carving, or a close up of some grasses. I mean really close up.  This is very important.  Your close up scenes of faces are what your eyes are going to be judging the clarity on anyway, so faces are good, and easy to find in your movie.  However, I started with the opening scene in Stargate, blu-ray, remastered, and was looking for a face, when I found the rock carvings to be a perfect place to fine tune the settings.  I turned sharpness up until it looked nice, not perfect.  As soon as artifacts and lines became too edgy, I turned it down a bit.  You are done there, perfectly done.  It won't seem right, but in a few seconds it will.
7. Contrast.  Contrast is the difference between the light and dark areas in the picture.  Contrast should never be set high, it will make your scenes look like spot lights are glaring off of faces and give everything an artificial feel and you actually lose a lot of detail by doing that.  So find a face, or a carving, or close up nature picture, pause it, and set contrast up a little, mine was 30 out of hundred, and each little step of the way, you will see sharpness become pin point accurate!  for real.  There you go.  Now your disk was worth the money.  :-)",1454716800,60,4020,4.191655801825293

Skip ahead to last week when I ordered a new TV and this disc (as the last person I lent my WOW disc to had lent it out to someone else and I couldn't get it back). So this disc arrives today and I pop it in the Oppo to try it out ahead of the new TV arriving in a few days. I have now calibrated my current TV using this new disc and found an enormous difference for the better over the calibration I've been living with for four years. I am excited to get the new TV and calibrate it using my new Spears and Munsil blu-ray. This disc is much more advanced than the Disney WOW and has provided an enormous difference over the calibration values that I settled on while using the WOW blu-ray.

5724735,4,B00CKWI13O,"Spears and Munsil offers the most comprehensive television setup disk I have found.  This set contains an exhausting amount of tests/comparisons to aid in the setup of a new HD set.  Why do you need it?  The routines provided on the disk allow you to tweak any relatively complex television to be certain that the adjustments are not affecting the image in a way that distorts the original signal.  It might be that the color hue is off slightly, or the contrast is not optimized, or any number of other obscure adjustments could be needed to improve your viewing.  On most modern sets, it is very possible that the automatic adjustment will bring you close; this routine will then get you spot-on.

  What I like:  The tests offered here go above and beyond the basics; you must follow the proper order to prevent the next adjustment from skewing the one you just made.  The disk covers a dizzying array of adjustments you might not have even thought to check, and can make a big difference if performed correctly.
  What I don't like:  This procedure requires that you be absolutely familiar with both the television as well as the disk before using.  It is a chore to use this for the first time, so be prepared to explore and experiment for some hours before you get it right.  In particular, make sure you know all of the adjustments on your set and how to access them through the remote, and be certain that you know how to properly save the setup on your TV, so that you don't end up back at the default configuration after going through this.  Also remember to take into account the room lighting when you view the television.

The bottom line is that the Spears and Munsil routine is a great tool for making the most of your HD experience, but for most inexperienced users, will require a considerable commitment on the part of the user to carry out from start to finish.",1441756800,4,1880,4.531157270029674

Turns out if you adjust the color setting by eye, it affects all the previous settings too (contrast, brightness, and so on). So you have to go back and do those by eye, too.

The sharpness calibration was way off. It had me turning my setting all the way down to 20 out of 100. It looked good on the test screen, but once I started actually watching things on the TV, the blur was out of control!

I finally got my screen to look passable, but it was hardly thanks to this disc.

Follow the examples and you will have no problems. After I went through all the settings and the color spaces I went back through all the settings and double checked all my settings.

If you are a regular person who doesn't have the hardware, get the Disney WOW version because it spends a lot more time with the contrast and brightness settings.

First time would take longer. But subsequent ones will be very fast. Any terminology questions can be quickly resolved with a Google search. A little bit of common sense would help with the calibration as well.

I recommend that you do the color space calibration FIRST even though it is the LAST one in the guide because it will eliminate the need to calibrate on bad color spaces.

My Denon AVR has its own sound calibration so I did not use this feature from the disc.

In my opinion, those who complained that they had no idea what to do with the array of calibrations available in the disc were not diligent enough (ie too lazy) in doing the due research to properly tune up the TV and probably did not even bother reading the clear instructions provided.

If you want something simpler, the Disney WOW disc available also here on Amazon is a good choice. NOTE:  I say this is good for making  ""Media Assisted Settings"". I state this, because, technically, it is not a TV calibration, but comes very close. One of the two discs I mentioned will produce amazing results.

Note Also: Do not get hooked into paying for a  so called ""Professional Calibration"".  That is simply unnecessary for a consumer level TV that costs less than $5,000. Most consumer level TVs can not really be ""calibrated"" in all aspects of the video standards anyway. The reasons are detailed and varied, but suffice it to say, most TVs have minimum or preset gamma settings as well as other reduced settings available even in so called ISF menus. Those who purport to claim otherwise are selling something. Unless you can not get comfortable or familiar with one of the many discs and make TV settings yourself, having someone else do it is a waste of money. Paying for a TV calibration is a mystique and may give a person bragging rights on how ""accurate"" their TV is, but there is no way to prove that. The charts and graphs, hobby level ""meters"", and even pro calibration devices are no guaranty of any better picture quality than using one of these discs to make Media Assisted TV Settings.

 Apologies, but I feel it is necessary to clear up the idea that a consumer level TV needs to have meters, graphs, and charts used to get optimum picture quality. In truth, the meters drift and the end result from a paid calibration are hugely dependent on the qualifications of the person doing it.

5724783,2,B00CKWI13O,"I bought this based on the recommendation from OPPO and all the great reviews. I spent hours reading the suggested online material making sure I had my ducks in a row. I went through the steps for the Video Calibration. I was not happy with the color adjustment method or only being bale to adjust the Blue color with their blue screen thing... The colors ended up quite unsatisfactory. Now I understand that blue is the most important color to set up and if the display is supposedly top notch then the red and green should be just fine.
Well, I ended up with reds that looked like florescent safety jackets when I evaluated with the reference demo material.
I thought it was so odd to have nothing that I could use to adjust the other primary colors.
This disc does have a ton of test patterns beyond the basic which I'm sure are good if you knew what to do with them. In the instructions it stressed that an important feature was to use the up arrow while viewing a test pattern to see examples of correct and incorrect settings and other info. That was present for the basic settings but for the more advanced settings; it only told you what they were for but not how use them.
All in all, I really feel this disc was a total waste of money. I'm not a pro by any means but I have been into home theater for well over a decade. I have had much better luck setting up my old 65"" Mitsubishi, friends TVs and my current 80 Sharp Aquos with the Digital Video Essentials: HD Basics calibration disc that I already had. This disc has all the same basic, and most important, test patterns. But more importantly it comes with three color screens to look through to set your colors properly.
This disc is also more used friendly for someone who might be learning what the test patterns are for and how to use them as there is a running dialogue explaining everything.
So after hours of trying to set calibrate my display, trying to see if I was missing something and going through a bunch of advanced test patterns to no avail. I gave up and used my old Digital Video Essentials: HD Basics disc and got the display looking great in a half hour.
I would never buy this again regardless of the great reviews in Home Theater, AVS Forum, OPPO...

This 2nd edition of the Spears & Munsil disc continues the company's tradition of having the most comprehensive set of test signals for the very advanced user. An excellent guide is available on the Spears & Munsil web site. A decent pamphlet is enclosed and some help is available on the disc, itself.

Make no mistake the number of test signals is comprehensive - no other disc comes close!

It is much easier to use and for most people it is the wiser choice unless you have a calibration meter and have done a fair amount of homework.

Quote from the Internet, ""Most HDTVs ship with default settings that are meant to look good in showrooms.""

One year ago I tried to optimize each of the plethora of settings independently  to satisfy my own eyes in my home environment. Since each of the settings acts in conjunction with all the other settings, I found too many permutations and combinations.

I previously used this Blu-ray 1st edition with excellent results. I bought the 2nd edition because I love to tinker. The 2nd edition is far superior. My wife overwhelming approved the improvement in our picture.

Obviously  you need a Blu-ray player  but I assume any owner of a high-end HDTV has Blu-ray. If you do not have a Blu-ray player  buy one Amazon for about $80  even if just to use it for this Spears & Munsil HD Benchmark and Calibration Disc 2nd Edition.

Almost all TV's 50 inches or bigger can benefit from some calibration to get a better picture, they often come out of the factory a little on the bright side and the colors slightly tweaked to the blue side as that is more appealing to the eye. To be clear, those that never calibrate still get a very nice picture and this is a value add step not a requirement.

For those adventurous or those who want to get more out of their picture this is a great Calibration Disc. It contains detailed instructions for not novice and all of the test patterns needed to tune your picture to reference standards or as close as your TV can get.

There are 3 levels of tuning the way I look at it, Basic tuning is just using the common controls, Brightness, Contrast, Color, and Tint, the ""knobs"" all TV's have. This disc will fix you right up and tell you what order to make the adjustments in. Next is Intermediate, where you get into a few more controls to by eye get everything to match what it supposed to look like. Finally there is the Pro tune, this is where test equipment is used to adjust the picture to an objective standard, you can buy or rent the calibration and do it yourself or pay a pro from 300 - 500 to do it (I would advise against hiring a pro unless you are a real purist and videophile, that last ounce of tuning is barely perceivable.

5724858,5,B00CKWI13O,"I have been reading several reviews on here, where the user said they couldn't figure out how to use the disc. Spears and Munsil have a website (Google Spears and Munsil), giving explicit instructions on how to use the disc.

First, when you select a test pattern in the menus, press the ""Up"" arrow button just above the ""Enter"" button on your remote control, either TV or Blu-ray/DVD player, it will show you what ""Correct"" settings look like and ""Incorrect"" settings look like.

They also give you instructions on how to adjust the settings for your contrast, brightness, color, sharpness, color temperature, etc., using your TV remote. If this is your first calibration disc, I've got some bad news for you: the disc does *NOT* calibrate your display for you. You must make these adjustments manually. It takes a bit of time, but should take no longer that 30 - 60 minutes to do a basic calibration without doing the more advanced tests that require special equipment, like a colorimeter or an SPL meter.

Also, if you are using a PlayStation 3 (PS3) to play this disc, keep in mind that you have to have ""Y Pb/Cb Pr/Cr Super White"" set to ""On"", or else your contrast, brightness, and color space settings will not look right, as whites and blacks and certain shades of colors will be clipped off without Super White on. In order to make sure Super White is on, press the ""Triangle"" button on your PS3 gaming controller/Blu-ray remote, select ""A/V Settings"", and you will see whether your TV is set to Y Pb/Cb Pr/Cr, and if Super White is on.

As for my review of the product, the video tests on this disc will help you yield the most accurate-looking picture without an ISF calibration. After running all of the tests, I have gotten everything it should look, aside from some minor color banding on the color space test. If you are new to calibration discs, get yourself a used copy of Disney: World of Wonder on Blu-ray to at least get instructions that spell out to you how to calibrate your display in layman's terms. That disc also has better audio tests, IMO, as well as a pixel flipper. Then decide if you want to drop $29.97 on this bad boy. Totally worth the money.",1383091200,214,2177,4.574358974358974

The tests were informative and helped with some issues.  As mentioned, it helped establish reference points - I performed the calibrations both with and without 3D glasses.

5724865,4,B00CKWI13O,"UPDATE 4 DEC 2013

After a fair bit of monkeying around I was able to understand the menu structure, and the ""tests"" are very useful. I found my Sony 55"" 4K to be pretty close to correct, but the seemingly small changes in backlight and such possible with this disc, made a huge improvement.

That being said a SW guy with a PhD in physics probably shouldn't have to work this hard to out a menu tree. I understand there is a tough balance between a 30 minute demo on using the menus as a intro, and throwing us to the wolfs cause nobody would watch that 30 min demo. If I was a web designer maybe I'd be able to offer useful tips. Maybe that is my tip :-)

But this disc will make a huge improvement to you TV picture if you spend the 45 minutes needed to learn how to use it.

The other thing you will need, if you have a ""normal"" LED tv like almost everybody does it a bias light: aka a nightlight behind the set. This is needed so that the blacks LOOK black even though a LED  can't really do black. This will be the best $20 you'll spend on TV stuff.
