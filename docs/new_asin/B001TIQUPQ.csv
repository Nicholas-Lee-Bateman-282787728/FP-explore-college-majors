8341624,4,B001TIQUPQ,"This 1970 German/Italian Napoleon Period erotic comedy may have a questionable title, but has virtues most erotic comedies of the late 60`s/early 70`s only dream of - good script, well-acted, decent budget, solid direction and cinematography, and never falls into the realm of stupidity most do. Justine and Ferdinand escape to the country of Tursa and purchase an Inn only to find out that all pleasures are taxed (kinda like here). Everything from drinking, smoking, sex, even dancing and laughter are taxable under the Committee of Decency so that the local Count in charge can raise enough funds to buy the countryside. So the outraged couple take down the Inn`s sign and and rename the building ""The Innocent Lamb"", disguising it as a convent school but in reality a brothel operating right under the watchful eyes of the local authorities. The savvy Justine utilizes trickery to trap the Mayor in his own 'taxable' behavior, turn the province back to its rightful Count and, ultimately restore things to order. All in all, an enjoyable romp for an early erotic period piece (these films became very popular in the early to mid 70`s), with good-looking women and just enough nudity, but it stands on its own merits to watch with your wife or girlfriend without her feeling taxed.",1267574400,4,1284,4.949074074074074
