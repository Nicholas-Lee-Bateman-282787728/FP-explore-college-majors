 As of Sunday April 19, 2008 at 1:34 AM there is no region free copy of the DeathNote Live Action Movie, BUT don't fret there is a two night only showing coming up (sorry I forgot the date) so I as well as many other die-hard DeathNote fans am hoping it will come to DVD as well. As for the story I don't want to spoil it, but I will say it's my favorite manga/anime and out of the hundreds I've read/watched it's high praise indeed.

Lastly I truly want to thank Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata for creating this masterpiece!
  Thank You and Farewell!",1208563200,4,613,4.213675213675214

there is NO official Legal Death Note Movie dvd that is region free. What you are buying here is a bootleg. A copy meant for profit for those who burn the cd, NOT THE CREATORS.

as you read from the reviews, even the unofficial subtitles are choppy!

support Death Note, do not buy bootleg!!",1205539200,3,336,4.387096774193548

8244272,4,B00126K484,"I highly suggest buying on 2 conditions:

1) You have already seen the first movie.
If you haven't seen the first movie, you'll be confused, even if you've read the manga or seen the show. The events that take place in the movie are different then that in the manga, but they accomplish the same things.

2) You don't mind less-than-well-done subtitles.
The subtitles you see in this movie are literal translations of what they're really saying, not what the writers intended to be said. So you lose a lot of the meaning in the lines.

Overall, I love this movie. Recommended for fans of ""Death Note"" and Japanese horror/mystery movies.",1205193600,,636,4.711711711711712
8244273,1,B00126K484,"I bought this as a set with the first movie. They were advertised as having ""English Subtitles"". The first movie's subtitles were pretty good and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it. The second movie, however, was a train wreck! The subtitles were so bad that even when they spoke an English word the subtitle said something completely different! Proper names were even translated! Light's name was ""Month"", Ryuzaki's name was ""Dragon"". If you want to buy this movie, I suggest you wait until it is released with proper subtitles. As popular as Death Note is, I'm sure it will be released in The States through an American company that will not only translate it correctly, but maybe even dub it.",1204070400,3,693,4.831932773109243
8244274,2,B00126K484,"There were two DVDs that were being sold with Enlgish subtitles...
Death Note(the movie), and this one...Death Note: The Last Name.

The 'english subtitle' is what mostly attracts you to buy it. But really...only the first DVD is worth the money...and barely...

The first DVD has good picture...and the subtitles 'although slightly off' were understandable...

But this second DVD...
There wasn't even an English subtitle option on the DVD itself. You would have to access a remote menu to find it...
'I used a P2S controller'

And as for the actual subtitles themsselves....
Whether it was the DVD or or whatever...they were HORRIBLE!

Choppy sentences like:

""nothing doing""
""I killed the clear poem to a knit""????

Makes me giggle...but then regret buying this. lol

I truly hope the people who own the DeathNote movies create a REAL and better product one day for its English fans. Cause subtitles like this are a disgrace...

I'll be looking foward to that day with cash in hand...",1200787200,4,987,4.969512195121951
