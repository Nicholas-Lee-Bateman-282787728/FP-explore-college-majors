8165749,4,B000M2DNGE,"Its sometimes difficult to follow due to the nature of training with the three section staff, but this video does a pretty good job of breaking down the movements into sections so they can be done in phases. It even shows movements in slow motion and different angles so the viewer can get the idea where hand placement is supposed to be and  how the movements are supposed to look.",1379116800,2,382,4.457142857142857

8165751,5,B000M2DNGE,"Ok good DvD except one thing for you people out there thinking this is a cool weapon don't get me wrong it is 100% but my advise to you is find someone that can teach you how to use your body with this weapon because it is Dangerous and you could really hurt yourself really badly because you have to use your body with kind of weapon and it moves really fast and there is no room for error one slip and that's it to the hospital you go trust me I have the real deal and I want even touch them, but I also have the fake ones to so I can practice with so I suggest you do the same. As for a trainer my brother is more experience then I so he is going to teach me this weapon method Again good luck and as always have a nice day : ) and practice hard",1362009600,,748,3.740506329113924
