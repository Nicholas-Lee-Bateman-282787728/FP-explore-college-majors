8015436,3,B0001OGUZY,Movie is only OK I bought as I live in the house that was used as a set.,1502841600,,72,3.0555555555555554
8015437,4,B0001OGUZY,"The truth of Sherleen Jauzzi of Price, UT and how she was found by Gardell H Grundvig, Lynn Lemon, and John Edison of Price, UT and the Band Nice'n Easy was fantastically guided.  Why the ending in this movie left out how those three men and how they prayed at the locked gate of the area they were sent out to search.  To then finish their prayer and decide to follow the fence to see if there was another way into their area, then to notice a shepard with sheep between them and her, and finally realize upon trying to ask her if she had a key to open the gate, was dramatic, Human, and THE TRUTH!",1459987200,,599,4.111111111111111
8015438,3,B0001OGUZY,Good heart felt show.,1419292800,,21,4.5
8015439,5,B0001OGUZY,"I just love this movie.  The characters are real and the acting is good. Liz crashes her plane on her solo flight to get her licence. and the rest of the film shows her family's search for her.  The whole town turns out to search for Liz . There are some very touching parts that will make you cry and then laugh.  It  portrays  life in a small town, perfectly.",1414886400,,361,4.1
8015440,4,B0001OGUZY,"I loved this movie.  It shows SO  many good things.  It shows how not to give up, even if it looks impossible, especially if people have fasted and prayed for a miracle.",1393804800,,169,4.21875
8015441,2,B0001OGUZY,"The story was interesting, but production left a lot to be desired.  I'd say this movie was one step above a home movie.",1379980800,,120,4.217391304347826
8015442,2,B0001OGUZY,"Movie is great for a B movie, but the quality of the video leaves something to be desired.  If you really want to watch the movie it's a good option vs. getting out a VCR.",1367971200,,171,3.8857142857142857
8015443,2,B0001OGUZY,I thought this film would be a nice aviation drama but it was so poorly done that I should just throw it away instead of letting it occupy precious space on my DVD shelves.,1355616000,,172,4.088235294117647
8015444,3,B0001OGUZY,I HAD to see this movie after hearing praises about the extraordinary character of this woman.  I wasn't impressed with her character or the movie.  Not so extraordinary.,1347148800,,170,5.035714285714286
8015445,5,B0001OGUZY,"Good movie, main male actor as the husband isn't very convincing but I knew the lady who crashed her airplane, had heard the story of survival as told by the husband and wife and enjoyed the movie depiction of what took place.  This was a good religious family who came to realize a very near tragedy and it brings a reminder to each of us of lifes every day struggles we all go through and we need to cherish loved ones all the more.  Amazon has a wonderful vast selection of items,easy to find and select, with reasonable prices, for any taste.",1294531200,2,546,4.3431372549019605
