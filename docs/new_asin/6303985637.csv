I had to ask someone working at a video store what the title was so I could track it down. Good Flick to keep the kiddies quiet when you're babysitting. Pop it in after Teletubbies.

762985,4,6303985637,"This is an excellent psychological thriller in which Bette Davis plays the part of a nanny in a household where a little girl, one of her charges, drowned in the bathtub and her older brother was blamed, even though he claimed that the nanny did it. After two years time spent in a therapeutic setting, the boy returns home, only to find the despised nanny still there. A cat and mouse game ensues between the two, and when his mother is poisoned, all eyes turn to him, though he once again insists that the nanny did it.
Deftly directed, with a well written, intelligent screenplay by Jimmy Sancster, who also wrote the screenplay for the Bette Davis vehicle, ""The Anniversary"", this is an engrossing film with a twist at the end that is sure to catch the viewer by surprise. The black and white cinematography adds to the atmosphere of suspense. Bette Davis is first rate as the nanny, and  fine performances by the supporting cast contribute to its overall success.
This is a film that fans of Bette Davis are sure to enjoy, as will all those who like well done, psychological thrillers.",1011484800,58,1090,4.618556701030927
762986,5,6303985637,"Oh, wow.  You definitely DO NOT want to miss Bette Davis as The Nanny!  Fran Drescher and Julie Andrews, eat your ... hearts out! Bette is the real deal, 100% ""proper"" and willing to go that extra distance to help out her charges.  And if that includes killing a few people here and there, well, hey, so be it! Seriously, The Nanny is high-octane entertainment, fueled by a truly frightening (and intense) Davis performance. This film came at a time when our Bette was enjoying a comeback, thanks to Baby Jane and Dead Ringer. She'd just made another hit, Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte, and then took off for England and Hammer Studios. The Nanny offered her a different kind of character. Gone were the bombastics, the wild-eyed theatrics. Instead, she chose to approach the role cautiously, meticulously, and it's a believable, touching characterization.  Sure, she's completely insane, and you certainly don't want her around when you're in ""the bath."" But given the circumstances, you can understand why The Nanny went bonkers.  Could happen to anyone...even you! Stylish direction from Seth Holt, able, competent supporting performances, and an absolutely stunning turn by 10 year old William Dix as ""Master Joey."" Whatever happened to him, anyway? He more than holds his own and deserved a grand career. Don't miss Pamela (The Innocents) Franklin as a ""mod"" upstairs neighbor.  Nanny says ""it's bathtime!""",1011139200,9,1409,5.104347826086957
762987,5,6303985637,"I have always thought that this film was ahead of it's time with talk of abortion and child murder. Given the times we live in now with the Susan Smiths of the world, it gives one pause to watch this film as an omen. Child care, latch key children, the Muenchhausen by proxy theory and countless other issues this film raises were perhaps TOO controversial for it's day. Today, just another headline.
I hate to see this film lumped in with quick paced horror/slasher films. It simply doesn't warrant that dismissal.
Not to mention this is arguably Ms. Davis' most restrained film performance of it's day.
Watch, learn and respect a little gem in cinema that I think has been unfairly dismissed as a ""guilty pleasure""",1005868800,7,716,4.690476190476191

763036,2,6303985637,"I bought the a set of BETTE DAVIS films and had heard of most of them but not the NANNY. It seemed like it might be a rare gem but I was disappointed on so many levels. As soon as the film started, I could see by the photography and setting that it was a low budget B film from the 60's.
I lived in London for a while and I felt that the British actors' accents sounded odd, fake and stilted but nevertheless, we have classic film legend Bette Davis and her accent that was always hard to pin down.

Little Joey (William Dix) is coming home after two years away at facility for emotionally troubled children. His cold-hearted father and emotionally fragile mother aren't quite prepared for his return. He was sent away after being blamed for the accidental drowning death of his baby sister.

THE NANNY moves along very slowly and the thriller part of the film only starts at the end. We are led to believe that troubled Joey refuses to adjust to being home. The nanny is loving and patient or so it seems. Davis plays a version of Baby Jane Hudson from WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE? Same character but a different movie, it seems. Davis has aged (and note the huge eyebrows) but there is emotion in her eyes and she is not the problem here. It's a poor script and a story that could be so much more. At times even the photography is out of focus and jittery.

This is not Bette Davis at her best and I felt this must be a ""She needed the money"" job for Davis at this point in her career. It's a clear pass. Not much thrills here. It's not a horror film as other reviewers have suggested. It's a psychological thriller as you wonder if Joey or the Nanny are sharing a secret. If you're a Bette Davis fan, it's a different film for her and you might want to take a look.",1479427200,,1772,4.205882352941177

763121,5,6303985637,"I will admit quite frankly that I am a Bette Harper fan and admirer. I am trying to catch up on all of her movies that I have missed. This one should not be missed. Bette Davis plays the role of the nanny and she does it admirably. At first, she is likable and probably had most of the audiences 'on her side' in regard to the little boy who is home from the mental facility. She has been the family's nanny for years and nobody could believe she caused the death of their little girl. The boy is blamed for the tragedy and shipped off. Things start up again and it gets spooky and eerie for some of the people. You certainly see Bette Davis in a different light. She is no longer the 'nice nanny' as it turns out. This is one of her better roles, I think. The movie was dark and spooky in parts but I enjoyed it thoroughly and plan on viewing it again. If you are a Bette follower, don't miss this one.

The story has many surprises and twists, and it will keep you riveted throughout.  This is a MUST HAVE for any committed and/or casual Bette Davis fan.

Shot in crisp black and white, with excellent performances from the cast, this is certainly one of Hammers best efforts. It benefits strongly from being a subtle thriller, rather than the gothic blood soaked efforts the company is more famous for.

It is cleverly written so that it is never clear until quite near the end of the film exactly who is the guilty one. Without giving too much away the crux of the story is which one of The Nanny or the 10 year old boy is the unhinged one. Could it be both of them? I have only watched the DVD once, and will probably watch it again just to make sure I've understood it correctly!

This movie comes towards the end of Davis' career and it's one of her final lead roles.  However, the film was not very interesting to me.

The story is good, but the film moves VERY, very, slowly.  Ironically,  the only character the viewer can sympathize with is the killer.  The father is cold and indifferent; the mother is a whining, emotionally disturbed weakling; the aunt is okay, but she's only around to raise the victim count; and the young boy is by far the MOST ANNOYING youngster I've ever witnessed on screen. I wanted so much for Nanny to off him. Perhaps that's good acting on the kid's part, but it goes on for way too long in this film and it left my nerves in pieces.

Bette Davis does the best she can with this role. The movie itself is far inferior to her, but she gives it her all.  I appreciate her willingness to play a full variety of characters, both sympathetic and unsympathetic alike.  My 5 stars are strictly for her gracing this movie with her magnficent talent.

The plot is the little boy is coming home from the psych hospital where he's been for 2 yrs due to the suspicious drowning of his little sister.  The kid's a brat but it turns out things aren't what they appear to be.  I don't generally like Bette's later film roles; I don't like to see such a great actress as a psychotic clown as she was in Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? and Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte.  I prefer to remember her as she was in The Little Foxes or All About Eve.  In The Nanny Bette combines stiff upper lip restraint with compassion, add in only a dash of psychosis.  I saw this movie for the first time on the late, late, late show and it stood out in my memory for a couple of reasons.  One, the world of children vs. adults, another, I felt sorry for Bette's character, the invisible nanny who missed out on a family of her own for very little in return.  The quality of the film is excellent, it's restored beautifully as everything I get from Amazon.",1210291200,6,1058,4.313131313131313
763272,4,6303985637,"This film is a neat little thriller.  Here, Ms. Davis plays a nanny at a household where a girl  died two years earlier. Her young brother is returning home from a correctional facility due to behavior problems immediately following her death.

When the boy arrives back, his mother is still near a nervous collapse and  not certain she can handle the boy, as he is still extremely unruly and could often use a good swack.  He also accuses the nanny of  killing his sister.

The film keeps you guessing and delivers some genuinely suspenseful moments as you begin to wonder what really happened 2 years ago and who is in danger. There's also a few shocks, and  I'm usually pretty hardy in these kinds of movies.

Bette Davis brings the movie up up a notch or two.  This was released in 1965, right after Davis' ""Hush, Hush Sweet Charlotte"" and 1962's thriller, ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"" the film which started Davis' period of the ""hag movies""...aging spinsters in dangerous situations.

The Nanny"" isn't nearly as over the top as ""...Charlotte"" or ""...Baby Jane"".  As a British nanny, Ms. Davis is more subdued, so you can better appreciate her nuances  and wonderfully expressive ""Bette Davis eyes"".  She again bravely shows what an aging woman looks like , without surgery and  thick make-up, something I wish modern actors would allow themselves to do.

Only problems with this movie are that the psychological explanation is a bit improbable and ties things up too neatly.  A twist at the end also  introduces a subplot that had minimal foreshadowing and would have been nearly impossible to guess.  Finally, while the movie holds interest, it doesn't have the continued intensity that makes  for a top thriller,  This is all forgivable with all else this movie has going for it, but probably lands the movie closer to a 3.5 star flick.

The DVD quality is excellent. However, there is no commentary and only a few extras, such as film trailers, the movie's posters, lobby cards, etc.  For that reason, you may want to rent the DVD first, to make sure it's a movie you would want to own.

Anyway, still a good movie and should not be missed by Davis fans or fans of good acting, old fashioned thrillers.",1209254400,2,2216,4.725848563968668
763273,4,6303985637,"Kind-hearted nursemaid or cold-blooded murderess?  Bette Davis delivers a finely understated performance as THE NANNY, an offbeat thriller from Hammer Studios in 1965.

Following the mysterious death of little Susy Fane, her older brother Joey (William Dix) is blamed and sent to a childrens' correctional facility.  Two years later, he's allowed home, but refuses to be left alone in the company of the family's long-serving nursemaid, Nanny (Bette Davis).  What exactly happened that has made Joey so incredibly wary of the seemingly-kind old nurse?

Bette Davis leads the charge with an absorbing performance in THE NANNY, arguably one of her most subtle and understated performances during a point in her career when she could get very hammy (pardon the pun).  Two years later she'd star in another memorable Hammer production, the delicious black comedy ""The Anniversary"".

William Dix (best-remembered for playing little Tommy Stubbins in the Fox musical ""Doctor Dolittle""), is a marvelous young actor and holds his own with Davis in their scenes together.  Wendy Craig, Jill Bennett and James Villiers are also very fine.  The movie also co-stars a fifteen-year-old Pamela Franklin (""The Innocents"", ""Legend of Hell House"").

You know where this one is probably going from the start, but it's interesting to watch it play out. However, there is some very disturbing stuff in this one, so note that it might be difficult to watch. It takes real advantage of the fact that Davis could play anything from the sweetest to the most evil person in the world, and turn on a dime at either end of the scale.

763332,3,6303985637,"Hmm.
A curious little film, produced in the sixties by notorious Brit-Studios Hammer (responsible in the seventies for some truly abhorrant horror flicks, earning cult status amongst students everywhere), 'The Nanny' stars an ageing Bette Davis in the titular role, of a sinister Nanny battling to keep her deepest darkest secrets being made public by her young charge, Joey.
The plot is actually rather good, taking in some unexpected little twists and turns, and the ending is also surprising. There are also some good and some excellent performances to be enjoyed. Sadly, none of this can save 'The Nanny' from mediocrity.
Davis is oddly-paced in this movie. She does a good job with the character in her normal moments - she's believable as the austere, slightly po-faced Mary Popping-Sans-Humour. In her less mentally-stable moments, however, she doesn't always manage to shake off the bored expression or the reigned-in emotion, and leaves us with a main character that is somewhat disjointed. Her final scenes are good, but not enough to make the character truly memorable.
Other shoddy performances come in the shape of Wendy Craig as the mentally disturbed and weak-willed Mother - she's not a credible character becuase, like Ms. Davis, her emotional commitment to her character comes across as antagonistic. For a woman who goes through such unspeakable emotional turmoil, she isn;t very emotional - unless you count a lot of weeping and fainting against walls. I don't. Her husband is played by James Villiers, an abysmal actor and the personification of why American shows like 'The Simpsons' show such ugly charicatures of British people - the producers could at least have shaved his ears and made two eyebrows for him.
Eyebrows, in fact, are a something of a recurring motif - some fool photographer thought it would be a good idea to pencil a huge pair of fake Joan Crawofords onto Bette, too. It was not a good idea. Ms. Davis' face has lost much of its emotional power because of this.
Happily, all is not lost on the acting front, but it's bizarre that it's up to the children to provide the most riveting viewing in 'The Nanny'. Master Joey is played beautifully by William Dix, who really could teach Haley Joel Osment a thing or three about creating sympathy without schmaltz. He gives a beautifully understated, extremely intelligent performance as Joey and is credible and believable as a 10-year-old boy inured to tragedy and loss.
His ill-fated little sister Susy is played by Angharad Aubrey, and even at the age of (I'm guessing) three years old she's credible as the beautifully innocent Susy - a real heart-wrencher because she is not allowed to become a silly, schmaltzy Hollywood-style 'Child'.
A cameo from the excellent child actress Pamela Franklin (The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie's Sandy) as Bobbie completes the roster of good, compelling performances in this movie.
Direction is quite simply bizarre. The interior scenes and lack of a musical soundtrack for much of the picture lend the feeling of Noir to the piece, but bad pacing and a very, very slow start to the film hamper the effect greatly. The end of the movie is shot very well, as are the scenes of physical and mental conflict - where Bette shines most, in fact.
All in all, I can't give this movie a huge thumbs-up. It's not a great Davis vehicle, nor is it really a compelling psychological thriller. It's passable, but with such a story and such a Star, one would really expect better of the normally excellent British movie machine.",1079308800,3,3536,4.924623115577889
763333,4,6303985637,"I only saw this movie twice -first on network television in the 60s (when I was so impressionable -which made this all the better to take in), and then nearly 20 years later through some channel surfing. If you've ever thought of going into child psychology, this is a great movie for creating and debating theories. Second, you'll find yourself switching sides, taking up alliances but still not quite sure who's narrating the movie. The somber, stoically-efficient Davis, with those ""eyes"", gives a wonderful performance that is subtlely matched by her young co-star. See this and ""Rebecca"" for a great Friday night movie fest!",1073174400,3,629,5.0576923076923075
763334,4,6303985637,"It was a great shame that director Seth Holt passed away only a few years after The Nanny, for he showed great promise here. He directs atmospherically from a script by Hammer veteran Jimmy Sangster, based on the novel by Evelyn Piper. Production values are superior, with camerawork by Harry Waxman and a musical score by Richard Rodney Bennett that descends delightfully into Psycho-esque frenzy at just the right moments.
The story has 10-year-old Joey battling his sinister nanny, whom he blames for the drowning of his younger sister a couple of years previously, but for which he was blamed. Events spiral into a kind of psychological face-off between the two. The climax is chilling.
A fine cast includes child actor William Dix (who reappeared a few years later alongside Rex Harrison in Dr Dolittle), Wendy Craig, Jill Bennett and James Villiers as the austere and ever so British father. Import Bette Davis has often been accused of really hamming it up in the title role, but I think she plays it just right.
The Nanny is certainly the finest in a string of psychological thrillers produced by Hammer Studios in the sixties, and overall one of the most memorable efforts of their heyday.",1066521600,6,1198,4.877450980392157

Nanny has always taken care of Virginia Fane and by extension her children. She takes more care of emotional Virginia now since her daughter Susie died two years ago by the hand of her older son Joey, who was sent away afterward. He's finally coming home and Virginia is a nervous wreck while Nanny, as always, calmly does what needs to be done. Joey is convinced that Nanny will kill him, won't eat any food she cooks, and plays cruel pranks on her and whoever else happens to cross his path. Is Nanny really homicidal or is Joey just a disturbed boy?

I expected an adult version of The Bad Seed when I saw this, but it turned out to be much more nuanced and emotional. From the beginning of the film, Nanny charms with her calm, serene, and respectful demeanor. She takes care of everyone and anticipates their needs, putting her charges above herself. On the other hand, Joey, although he's around eight years old, is insufferable and cruel. He wants to prove his independence, but ends up creating more messes for Nanny to clean up. His other antics include unsuccessfully dropping flower pots on a milkman's head and screaming at Nanny for no real reason. The one time he really get her with a prank is when he leaves a doll in a full bathtub.

This film is inflammatory for the time in a few ways. First, the Nanny isn't a cold blooded killer. Her mind simply couldn't handle it after she accidentally drowned Susy, her beloved charge, right after she found out her own neglected daughter died in a back alley abortion. Her awareness shifted between seeing the dead child floating face down and seeing a cheerful, living child bathing. Dead children in film is still incredibly taboo, so I was surprised to see that there is an extended, horrific scene of the drowned child. I was also surprised that Nanny's portrayal is quite nuanced and emotional. I felt so sorry for her that both of her children were taken from her in tragic ways after putting herself second for so long. After she realizes her evil deeds, she saves Joey and seems to turn herself in.

The Nanny is a sad film for a thriller that has nuanced characters (except for hysterical and childlike Virginia unfortunately) and a much more complex plot than I expected. The only frustrating part of the movie is that Joey, hellion child, is never punished for any of his wrongdoings. He's more annoying and malicious than the kid in The Babadook and he's proven to be right. Ugh. Joey will probably harp on that I told you so for the rest of time. Other than that, The Nanny is a surprisingly good movie with strong performances.",1508025600,,2613,4.576923076923077
