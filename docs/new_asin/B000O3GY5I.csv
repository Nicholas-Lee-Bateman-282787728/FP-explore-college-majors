I bought it because I wanted to pick up playing the keyboard again and I enjoy gospel music so I figured why not, it should be worth the money if it does what it promises. I was not pleased with the video quality aesthetically or the way it was put together as far as editing. It seemed very homemade. The picture and sound were of poor quality. The lessons were not as detailed as I would have liked and the overhead view of the instructor playing was not easy to see. The lessons were breezed through. Also it is rather boring to watch. I didn't expect it to amuse me or anything but I did expect it to keep my attention. It is not for a novice or someone a few years out of touch. I'm not usually one to give anyone unfavorable reviews, I think everyone deserves something for effort, but I was really disappointed. I really don't feel it is worth the price. I returned it within 1 week of receiving it.",1202947200,2,1017,4.1938775510204085
