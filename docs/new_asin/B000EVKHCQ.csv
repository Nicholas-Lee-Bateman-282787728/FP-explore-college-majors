For taking the time to preserve audible popular art, in this case harmonized folk music with a distinctive seachanty flavor, you have me permanently in your debt.  The late Tom Rowe's contribution, also for sure, qualifies this as a family heirloom.

I promise to do my part as custodian of this little box of plastic and celluloid by taking the best possible care to see that it remains preserved.

I have been in Schooner Fare's audience, and I have their music on my shelf, but for someday having my son's grandchildren appreciate what my son learned to love, tunes heard in my home from the time they were in diapers,  and able to see it the source of it performed live on stage as the people's music was intended to be is worth more than printed words can express.

Thanks Guys, and please pass a condolence for me to Tom's family.

The music is wonderful, but the best part is the banter between numbers.  You can't get that on CDs.  The quality of the video isn't the best, but you kind of expect that with a video of a live concert.  And this may be the only way to see the guys between concerts.  And to have it from before Tom's death makes it even more treasured.  Best money I've spent in a long time.",1268092800,,548,4.065420560747664
