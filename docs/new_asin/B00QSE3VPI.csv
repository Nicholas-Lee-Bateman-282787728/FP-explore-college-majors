8692580,3,B00QSE3VPI,Love the DVD but the ball was a disappointment.,1462406400,,47,4.333333333333333
8692581,5,B00QSE3VPI,"This is the best pilates workout video available.  The background (Hawaii) is beautiful, and the instructor progresses the exercises in a way that makes sense for the body.  The level gradually increases until suddenly you are doing things you could never have done in the beginning of the video.  The instructor has a way of subtly tricking the body into moving at peak capacity by warming up the required parts separately, until by the end of the video, you are functioning better than you knew you could and wondering how you ever got there!  She is an amazing teacher and gives modifications for various levels, so this is a great video for beginners as well as those who have done pilates for years.",1436486400,,704,4.699186991869919
8692582,5,B00QSE3VPI,"If you want a solid core workout, without feeling like you are being ""worked"", this is a great video.  It incorporates traditional pilates moves with interesting twists with the small ball, so that it is fun and fresh (for both your mind and your muscles).  Cindy's style is low key and gentle and she leads you through the exercises, so the moves are easy to follow.  I think this would be a good workout for both beginners and the more intermediate/advanced.  With the beautiful background and pleasant music, I feel like I am working out in Hawaii with Cindy and I always finish the workout feeling refreshed, instead of tired and sore.  (I especially like doing this workout in the evenings, since I feel calm and relaxed afterwards.)  However, I do feel it the next day, so I know I am getting a great core workout!",1433721600,,820,4.582191780821918
8692583,5,B00QSE3VPI,"I've enjoyed Cindy's classes for years and this DVD is perfect for an extra weekend workout or when I can't make it to class. I feel more relaxed and ready for my daily activities after her core workout. She emphasizes the importance of posture and balance while aging. It feels so good I refer to her workouts as ""self-massage""

8692584,5,B00QSE3VPI,"Highly recommend this Pilates workout -designed to safely build core strength, challenge your flexibility and balance while stretching/lengthening through your spine and key muscle groups.  Cindy calmly walks you through the exercises, provides modifications and gives explanations so you can engage both your mind and body.  Also there is an emphasis on proper alignment and breathing to ensure you achieve a safe and effective workout.  Plus the backdrop is Hawaii- what else could you want?",1428883200,,493,5.546666666666667
8692585,5,B00QSE3VPI,"Love this small ball workout! The small ball included can be deflated when you want to take it on the road and easily re-inflated with the straw provided. The beautiful Maui filming location, the pleasant piano music in the background and Cindy's calm and professional instruction make this a great workout with a somewhat meditative quality to it. She provides very helpful modifications and reminders on form so the workout is great for all levels.",1428710400,,450,5.013333333333334
8692586,5,B00QSE3VPI,Great product.  This is a workout that anyone can do.,1424822400,,53,4.3
8692587,5,B00QSE3VPI,Cindy is the best! This is a great workout and is thorough while being safe for all levels. I love the small ball and find it facilitates my workouts even when I am not using the DVD as a guide. Cindy knows her anatomy and knows how to teach!,1421884800,,242,3.9591836734693877
8692588,5,B00QSE3VPI,"I bought the DVD and ball and the workout is absolutely amazing. Starting with the breathtaking background of the Maui coast and the light breeze waving through the palm trees, Cindy's soft and knowledgeable instructions calm you down and get you emotionally ready for the exercises.
I love the ball and the whole workout incorporates different positions and moves with the ball, alternating exercises to give you a well balanced and great workout for all parts of the body. This is easily the best Pilates video I have ever used. After the workout you feel refreshed and renewed, full of energy to take on the challenges in your life.
Thanks so much for the DVD, Cindy, so we can have you as an instructor throughout the week.",1418169600,2,727,4.732283464566929
8692589,5,B00QSE3VPI,"This is an excellent full hour of classic Pilates, enhanced by adding a ball.  I found the background music perfect for getting into the mind/body zone and Cindy really knows anatomy and Pilates.  She has a pleasant voice, and the pace of the workout is excellent. I will use this whenever I can't get to my regular Pilates classes.  I am ordering two more, one for each of my grown daughters. Not only would they enjoy this complete and not overly strenuous (for them) workout, but when I visit them, I won't have to remember to bring my copy!",1418083200,3,544,4.474747474747475
