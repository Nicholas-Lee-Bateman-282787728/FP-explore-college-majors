8280018,5,B001AXAMKO,"Folks, if you still want to get Superkids brand new, google Kenneth Copeland Ministries store.
They have all the DVDs and music CDs related to the same. The only thing they haven't redone is the Superkids Music Videos.
A classic for the next generation. Ranks right up there with The Faith Adventures of Wichita Slim. Good Christian values you will want to watch again and again. ^_^",1365465600,3,383,4.731343283582089
