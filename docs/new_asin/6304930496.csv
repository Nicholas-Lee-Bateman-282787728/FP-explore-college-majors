7879572,5,6304930496,"This is a gem. It's short, its really just a cheesy action movie. But the characters have personality and chemistry that make it enjoyable. The waning of brief nudity refers to the preview before the movie for Devil Hunter Yohko. Even that is a fairly tame ""magical girl"" transformation sequence. To clarify some confusion from other posters, there is infact one brief scene that technically includes nudity. It's a nipple slip. A character is lounging on a  couch and for like 2 seconds you can just barely see a black dot indicating her single nipple as her shirt leaves it exposed in that position. I didn't even see it when I watched it as teenage boy, so that's how hard to spot it even is.",1480550400,,695,4.56

7879574,5,6304930496,"This is a fun, fast paced, and exciting anime. It is almost as good as Iria:Zeiram the Animation. Buy it.",971049600,2,105,4.3
7879575,3,6304930496,"The Sol Bianca is a interdimensional starship controlled by several female  pirates.  The women (and girl) are a little too contrived (they each have  totally distinct personalities that separate them from each other--nothing  in common), but the action  is there and the anime is fairly good.
The  Sol Bianca and her crew have been raiding the pirate ships of Emporor  Batros (typical space-anime name).  In one of the raids, they find a small  boy who has to get to one of the planets he rules to find his mother.  He  promises them that the emporor holds a treasure that has the secret of the  human race as well as gold, jewels and cash.  They jump at the  situation.
The emporor wants the Sol Bianca because it has a technology  to go into subspace without a need for a hypergate, so the battle begins.
If you are looking for the adult version of POWERPUFF Girls, try this  one out.  However, I do not think it is worth the money to buy it.  Rating:  C",965952000,,957,4.427745664739884
7879576,4,6304930496,"I enjoyed this movie quite a bit, although there are some fairly large plot holes. Why does Rim's presence on board keep the ship from jumping  into hyperspace? Where did the ship get that cool supercannon it used in  the end? And how did the pirates fly safely back to the shuttle with half  the Tres airforce on their tail? These problems notwithstanding, it was fun  light watching with some really sharp animation. Among my favorite effects  are the Sol Bianca submerging and reemerging from hyperspace, and Feb  perched on the orbital ring, firing at the surface with a sniper rifle  (well, she said it was designed for long range. . . .)
The music ranges  from unremarkable to cheesy, mostly showing up only in the fight scenes.  You'll probably never even notice that it has music, and skipping it would  detract little from the movie.
One of my favorite parts of the movie is  the characterization of the pirates. They are definitely self interested  pirates, far more interested in plundering space lines than saving the  world. While not particularly ruthless (they don't kill too many people in  their raids,) they are most definitely pirates, and only heroic in  comparison to truly evil people. For example they are more than happy to  threaten Rim with spacing out the airlock if he doesn't volunteer more  information about his presence on their ship. The quarrel and argue in a  very convincing (if occasionally overly cute) way, they manage to fall  somewhere between Errol Flynn's ""Robin Hood"" and Long John  Silver.
I'm curious about the name of their ship: ""Sol  Bianca."" The planet names are Spanish (Tres: Three, Uno: One,) so the  ship name could also be Spanish, but I can't find a meaning for  ""Bianca"" in any language, other than it being a girl's name. If  you spell it ""Sol Blanco,"" it translates as ""White  Sun,"" which is not only appropriate for a white ship, but a cool name  in any case.",965779200,4,1919,4.739393939393939
7879577,5,6304930496,"This  animation is very entertaining and original, straight from the start, the nature of the heroines objective is clear! Superb animation, great story line, a must for all action fans of animation. The only let  down is the statement in small letters on the box which can put some people  off. Contains ""brief nudity"" but their isn't any, only from the  trailer for another film? This is a must see animation for die-hard fans!",947289600,2,429,4.756756756756757
