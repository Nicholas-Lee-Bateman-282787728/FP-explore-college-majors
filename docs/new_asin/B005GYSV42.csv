8472411,4,B005GYSV42,"Alfred Drake has such a small presence on video that anything available is worthwhile.  As noted by the prior reviewer he was an important Broadway Actor who originated many important roles.  Though these Bell Telephone Hour Broadcasts only hint at his work, they provide an important document.  The quality of the video images are good and the sound is good considering the source material.",1433548800,,391,5.078125
8472412,3,B005GYSV42,"VAI continues to give us gems from television's musical past, his time with a tribute to Alfred Drake's fans. Both of us. Taken from the Bell Telephone Hour from the years 1959 to 1962, Drake's oleaginous charm was not made for the small screen. A towering stage presence---he was the original male lead in Oklahoma!, Kismet and Kiss Me Kate, a distinguished Shakespearean actor who supported both Katharine Hepburn and Richard Burton)---on the small screen he looks like ham. His rich low tenor is pleasing enough, but his diction is so great that he snaps out those consonants as if they were bullets flying at critics in the audience. The choice in material, as well as co-stars, far fit better the original period. It's difficult to describe just exactly what the middle-aged Drake and Sally Ann Howes do to the Bernstein-Sondheim classic ""Tonight."" Drake also sings with Mindy Carson, Patrice Munsel and Jack Parr's little gamine, Genevieve. Neither Drake nor any of his leading ladies really have made the cut into immortality, and the mittle European style seems annoying today. Nevertheless, it's a time capsule not to be missed.",1317513600,11,1137,5.021164021164021
