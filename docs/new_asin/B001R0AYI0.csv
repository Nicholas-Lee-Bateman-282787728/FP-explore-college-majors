3771761,3,B001R0AYI0,"This is the Vandread Release or actually it is Funimation rereleasing the Pioneer/Genon Badly encoded versions. Personally I do not have any issues with the story or characters because this happens to be one of my favorite anime series Right next Gundam and Macros (yes I did say Gundam & Macross, your gapping mouths can now close). My issues with this series is poor handling or production done by the american distributors ( Pioneer/Genon). The Series was made in 2000 based on 1999 video standards witch means everything is made for 4:3 televisions. Kind of how cartoon network and ScFy broadcasts all of its programing ( the only exception to that is on SW:CW series is the only Hidef or widescreen show actually broadcast in a widescreen format because lucasarts threatened lawsuits against them But I degrees.  This release just like the previous 2 releases of this series is poorly encoded come on get rid of the damn black bars on top and bottom of the screen this is a 16:9 presentation on widescreen TVs in 2010 not 4:3 TVs in 2000. Now all of the Video poor processing done by Genon and ADV that Funimation had purchased will be corrected nut usually not until  that series gets its blu-ray treatment by funimation. Course you relies that Funimation's ability to reprocess the original film rolls into Hidef digital material is one of the reasons that company has survived the downturn for Anime in the US because Funimation does its own Processing, Production and Duplication in-house The funimation menu included on the disc is better quality then the video shown on the disc in the first place), the competitors didn't & are now bankrupt. Final word on this release if you want another copy of your Genon Vandread release that saves you some shelf space get this copy, if however you want higher quality reprocessing of the product that will play nicely on HDTV wait for Funimation's Blu-Ray release of this series next year, then you will see a big difference.",1267574400,,1976,4.8088235294117645
3771762,5,B001R0AYI0,"It is often in the world of anime that the viewer has no clue what is really the backdrop of the existing conflict until several episodes into the series, or in some extreme cases not until halfway through the series or, worse, until the blatant end. The opening of the first episode of Vandread says more than enough about the background: someone took a bunch of colonists headed away from Earth at high speed, divided them up between male and female, put them on separate planets, and forgot to tell them to play nice with their neighbors. Oops.

Fast forward seventy years, and the war of the sexes is in full swing between Tarak (male) and Majeir (female). Divided and petty in their own societies, both sides have really only one unifying goal: flatten the other side. Even still, there are some people here and there who don't believe in the war so much as they believe in doing what they want to do, like interplanetary pirates or a factory worker who thinks he can pilot the machines he has only built since he was young. And when one such male factory worker gets caught on a ship being attacked by female pirates, instant gender-bending conflict is a given. Throw in a stoic and observant male medical officer and a 'politically saavy' pilot officer into the fray, and it goes from 'conflict' to 'this isn't going to end well for someone'. Vandread plays every ounce and angle of that conflict for every bit that it is worth, and manages to play it completely without the air of a horrid 90's sitcom, unlike some other anime that have gone there.

-x-x- SPOILER WARNING -x-x-

And then, there is the reality of the conflict. Towards the end of the first half, an observant viewer would notice that there is something rather unusual about the other colonies they come across, and these strange automated enemies that keep attacking the ship and crew. Know how the colonists fled Earth almost a century ago? They fled for a very good reason, and herein the title of this review comes into play. The colonists (as well as dozens of other colony groups) were allowed to leave by the regime on Earth so that they could escape the hostile environs the planet had become, and would later be harvested for body parts to be used as replacements for the failing bodies of the inhabitants of Earth. Invasion of the Body Snatchers meets Battlestar Galactica in a very macabre fashion, though for viewing sensibility the actual proceeds of the harvest are never really shown. Less is the better on that note.

The elitists of Earth believe they are entitled to the body parts of their colonists to sustain their lives theoretically forever. Thankfully, the Pirates step down the Jolly Roger and pick up their guns, ready and willing to stick it to the harvesting fleets from Earth. One ship of mismatched crazies, however, is not ample to flatten an automated mechanized invasion and harvesting fleet, so they go about picking up some heavier firepower from people they meet along the way home, and then try to convince their respective home planets that something evil this way comes. After much wrangling (and use of a whip in one case O.o) the battles lines are drawn and things get brutal quickly.

I'll leave the rest to your viewing pleasure.

-x-x- END SPOILERS -x-x-

Vandread is a bit unusual, in that it makes use of conspicuous CGI for the space combat scenes, but everything else is standard anime cel-shading. The first time or two you see this, it can be a bit jarring, but the battles are executed with flair on the part of the production staff and the cel-shading is not at odds with the CGI, but rather the CGI provides a very good compliment to the anime as a whole.

The storyline starts off on the anti-side of boy meets girl, and ends up asking more than one existential question by the end. Vandread comes off as one of those rare series that you can watch for the basic entertainment value of drama, gender conflict, or gratuitous space combat, or you can read into it as far as you want and come out with more than a few social-political questions that need better answers nowadays (or else fear that something this twisted becomes cold, hard reality for all of us, not just in a show).

For anyone who can stomach mecha anime as a whole, I highly recommend it.",1252108800,,4282,4.623684210526315
3771763,3,B001R0AYI0,"Vandread isn't really all that new, in fact, having made its Japanese broadcast debut way back in 2000, one might go as far as to say it's pretty darn old.  But like most Gonzo titles, it's survived the test of time over and over again.  Funimation's recent box set release of the property represents the third time the DVDs have been released to the North American market; first through Pioneer, then repackaged and re-released from Geneon.  Suffice it to say, tales with this kind of staying power rarely reach this status undeservingly.

Funimation's release consists of all 26 episodes, which were in fact two seasons (Vandread & Vandred The Second Stage), across four discs.  Housed in an attractive cardboard slipcase, the four discs come in a pair of artistic thin packs.  Total runtime comes in at 600 minutes even and the show wears a very conservative 13 & Up rating.  Conservative because the show really is friendly to viewers of all ages save for a few sexual innuendos and extremely-light cussing.  There is no nudity to speak of and while death is presented on occasion, it is never graphic or overly violent.

The set presents the usual dub & sub dialog options; An English dub, original Japanese audio track (with English subtitles is so desired).

Classifying the show isn't near as easy as typing out its hard stats however, as I'm quickly discovering.  Technically it's a mecha entry on account of its use of robotics throughout.  In fact the very term Vandread is derived from the concept of the physically conjoining of a fighter robot called a Van-Type and a space-fighter craft known as a Dread.  When combined, the two craft become a powerful giant robot that can range in appearance from a hulking, oversize-gun carrying humanoid to a metallic crab surrounded by orbiting weapon-spheres depending upon the combination of the ships involved.

However, and unlike most robot shows, Vandread is as much a space-opera as it is a science fiction/ action piece.  It's set in the distant future in a Universe where mankind has expanded his reach of population to include multiple planets and space stations.  However, and what makes Vandread unique, the show literally opens with a propaganda film designed to frighten an all-male populous with the fact that all women are, in fact, monsters.

See it turns out that in the future, thanks to cloning techniques, male and female copulation (or even cohabitation for that matter) is no longer necessary to continue the race.  As such both sexes are only vaguely aware of the other's existence.  Yes it's a novel concept and sure it lends to Vandread's individuality as a whole, but the same-sex reproduction ideals are a bit sketchy (if not homosexual promoting).

The big gag, at least early on anyway, works off the concept of three males becoming entangled with an all-female pirate ship before being transported, via a space-warp, to a distant galaxy to avoid annihilation.  The core of the story follows this ship's (the Nirvana) voyage back home while paying special attention to the daily drama stirred up thanks to the differences between the sexes.  No, not those differences, but rather the awkwardness and feelings of passion that only be achieved through the old ""opposites attract"" concept.  It's immature, it's silly, it's sometimes annoying but Vandread makes certain to counteract the goofiness with a steady-dose of CG rendered action sequences that still hold up even after all these years.

The visuals are far more solid then they have any right to be considering the show's vintage.  What's that, you say there are shows far older (Gundam Wing or Macross for example) that still look nice so what's the big deal?  Well keep in mind that right around the time that Vandread was created, the world was making a collective move away from standard hand-drawn cells and painted backgrounds to an all out computer generated imaging overload.  That's fine and good, but many early efforts of the practice suffered from limited hardware capabilities, stiff animation and poor texturing.  Somehow Vandread ducks and weaves through this minefield of pitfalls by combining a beautifully vibrant color pallet in the standard animation with CG inspired exterior backgrounds and robot models.  Sure, the process has been refined in the nine years since but that isn't to say Vandread suffers any as a result.

Pacing can best be described as all over the place as the early episodes were brutally formulaic and relied far too heavily upon the whole ""men and women meeting for the first time will be funny"" gimmick.  Additionally most of the first season is structured more as a succession of stand-alone episodes than a single ongoing tale.  This trend degenerates to grander story arcs as the show progresses and by the middle of the Second Stage; Vandread feels more like a traditional mecha anime entry.

In my opinion the move away from the cuteness and attempts at slapstick to the slightly more psychologically engaging plots of the Second Stage was a step in the right direction.  So much so in fact that I almost feel like the series probably would have hit its stride in the third or fourth season had it lasted that long.

As a whole the show suffers a bit in terms of confliction scope, as the enemies our cast frequently engages throughout the entire series are never really known as anything other than ""the enemy"".  Worse still, they appear out of nowhere, get whipped, then live to attack another day.  Their motives are never clear, nor is their presence ever fully justified.  Other detractors along the way include an over-the-top (and quite obnoxious) lead male character, and overly naive lead female character, and what can only be described as a robotic version of He-Man's annoying court jester, Orko.

The soundtrack is especially well done with a reoccurring techno number that's simply infectious.  I had the pleasure of enjoying the set though a 5.1 surround sound speaker set and found that the rolling bass riff coupled with a high end of synthesized horns flawlessly.

In conclusion Vandread is certainly not for everyone but manages to survive the test of time thanks to its unwavering (if at times, forceful) charm.  While it rarely gets the credit it deserves, the show certainly paved the way for many robot-based series that would follow (titles like Gravion and Godannar).  This latest DVD release from the masters of quality at Funimation assures that Vandread will continue to spread its charm with the presentation values it deserves.",1242432000,12,6546,4.972451790633609
3771764,4,B001R0AYI0,Vandread is an interesting example of the giant robo genre of japanese animation with a little bit of harem comedy added in for a bit of spice.,1242000000,,143,4.333333333333333
3771765,4,B001R0AYI0,"On The surface Vandread seems to be another stupid harem anime with mechs thrown in for show.  At least that what I thought when i discovered in a used bin and passed on it. The DVD Flavor Text just billed as a war between the sexes, and it is, but it tries something new. In Vandread Earth like in your usual Future anime has started to fall to ruin so they send colony ships into space.  Somehow two ships  land on to planets and the early colonists decide to separate the sexes.  Flash forward to the present as the men prepare to launch a new weapon in the war against the women.  Here we meet the male protagonists. Hibiki, the usual misunderstood loner,  Deuelo the Enigmatic Doctor and Bart, the spoiled funny guy. A female pirate ship attacks at that moment. We meet the female leads. Dita, the Ditsy alien freak, Jura the sultry one and Meia the misunderstood Serious one The men launch a counterattack The ships semi-sentient power source activates and send them spiraling across the universe where they are attacked by a mysterious enemy.  Thus begins their adventure back home as the mystery behind their worlds and their present situation is slowly revealed.
  The show a mixture of Comedy, drama and adventure. they don't blend evenly as the episodes jump between the genres.  As the story progresses we see the women and  men come to terms with their past prejudices and views. The Cast is enormous beyond the main 6. rash secondary character is unique and have seperate personalities. From the smart Girl with glasses, The Bratty little girl and even a cosplay freak who spend much of the episodes in a bear suit. the numerous background characters are seperated by where they work where only the bridge cew is distinct. Most of the 6 leads have episode or two to show growth.  and One or two characters have their own secrets.  By the second stage we have all the pieces set for a climatic battle as all secrets are revealed and we find out what really happened 100 years ago.  This thinkpak is a bargain for both stages.
  A little thin in the extras department. But it looks nice and the English voice cast is filled with the well-knowns like Mary Elizabeth McGlynn,Wendee Lee, Tony Oliver, and Steve Blum. They do an excellent Job. But if you aren't into the dub there is a Japanese track. it is a fun series once you give it a chance. Starz had both stages in continuous run for years. give it a chance.",1238889600,4,2424,4.550691244239632
3771766,3,B001R0AYI0,"After watching the first season, while I was left feeling happy with the quality of the series for what I paid, the shallowness of Vandread makes me happy I didn't pay a huge amount for it.

Plot: 7/10

Women are an alien species: We men already know this much already. Vandread takes what we know a step further, really making men and women aliens by putting them on different planets.

At the start of the series, the men of Taraak and women of Mejere were about to start a war. The men got fed up of a group of women space pirates and decided to put a stop to them, unleashing a new battleship against them. However, much to the dismay of the men, the launch of the battleship went badly, the women space pirates stealing the ship.

During all this, a young 3rd class worker, Hibiki, decided to sneak onto the battleship to steal a Vanguard (male mecha) part, ending up getting stuck on board when it launched. He soon found himself thrown in the brig by the men, just before the women attacked.

After the women took over the ship, the men decided to destroy it rather than let the women have it by firing missiles at the ship. This resulted in the ship *somehow* blocking the missiles and getting sent to a distant part of the galaxy. The men and women on board the battleship then had to start working together since they soon discovered a new alien race that wants to ""harvest"" humans...

----

The plot did have a lot of potential. If taken seriously, a plot involving a war of the sexes could have been amazing... If turned into a comedy, it had the potential to be insanely funny. Sadly, however, Vandread turned out to be light-hearted, shallow and not very funny.

The plot does not develop much at all once the Nirvana (the battleship mentioned previously) gets warped to a distant part of the galaxy. The crew face battles against their new alien enemy, known only as ""harvesters"", go down to the mostly deserted planets they pass for supplies, fight with each other, play with each other... Episodic stuff.

It's really quite disappointing that the series was taken in such a light-hearted direction when it would've worked much better as a more adult series.

Characters: 7.5/10

The characters, while not exactly being deep or unique, saved the show from being bad.

The main character of Vandread is Hibiki, a young male who wants to prove himself. He's simple minded, direct, bad tempered... The type of lead you see in shounen series on a regular basis. Truth be told, he isn't very interesting, with no background details revealed outside of him being a 3rd class citizen; no depth.

Dita, the female lead, was much more likeable. She insists on calling Hibiki ""Mr. Alien"", following him around everywhere due to being curious about the male gender and generally annoying the hell out of Hibiki. She was the most funny character in the first season and by far my favourite, if only for being a redhead.

The other 2 female main characters, Jura and Meia, were less interesting. Jura is your stereotypical flirtatious woman and Meia is your stereotypical military type, hiding her emotions and commanding the others in battle. Meia had the most development (not that that's saying much...) in the first series since her past has been revealed, but the sequence about her past wasn't designed very well and had little to no impact on me.

The other 3 characters I found to be interesting are male: Bart, a wimpy guy who ended up steering the ship since only a male can, the male doctor Duero and Rabat, a Han Solo type. Rabat will hopefully get fleshed out in the 2nd series, him being one of the few intriguing characters.

Art/Animation: 9/10

For a show that aired back in 2000, Vandread most certainly looks impressive. It was a rather nice surprise to discover that the the DVDs are in widescreen format.

There was no obvious corner cutting on the art and animation side during the first season; everything looked smooth and nice to look at. The colours made everything look bright and eye catching.

CG is used for all of the space battles in Vandread. I'm sure it looked amazing back when Vandread originally aired, but the CG sections haven't survived the test of time and don't impress in this day and age. I didn't really like the speed the CG battles went at since I found it hard to follow what was going on a lot of time... I suppose the idea was to make the CG battles as fast-paced as possible in order to impress more.

Overall, Vandread looks excellent for its age.

Sound: 5/10

The soundtrack was more distracting than anything. The person who created the soundtrack deserves to be shot... That's all there is to say really.

The OP/ED were pretty good. Nothing too memorable but the themes made watching the OP/ED animation more enjoyable.

As ever with Japanese voice acting, the performances were mostly excellent. There was no noticeable bad performances.

Total: 7.3/10

Enjoyable yet disappointing, Vandread is a great show to watch to pass time. Just don't go into it expecting to see the best anime of all time.",1234051200,2,5058,4.655056179775281

8336928,4,B001R0AYI0,"This anime isn't much different than some of the other space/harem/comedy stories out there. It's very similar to shows like Nadesico or Dragonaut. The thing that makes this anime good like the others I mentioned is the multitude of cool characters it has. There are plenty of neat characters that are fun and that keep the story interesting. The story line is pretty cool. There are 3 men stuck on a ship of women. In their world women and men live separately and do not interact. This makes for a lot of funny and awkward situations. The animation is pretty good and the voice acting isn't bad either. Vandread isn't exactly an original masterpiece, but it's pretty entertaining and lots of fun. If you're looking for an amazing and original story, then look elsewhere. If you just wanna laugh and have fun then Vandread is a good place to start.",1350777600,,848,4.66
8336929,4,B001R0AYI0,"I won't bother going into the details of the plot as plenty of other reviewers have done so.  It's a mecha show, with a hefty dose of comedy and a lot of women thrown in.  Overall, I rather liked most of the characters and found their interactions amusing and interesting.  The graphics are well done and the action scenes are definitely a treat.  The plot takes a couple of twists which also keep things lively, especially one right near the end.  My biggest gripe and the reason this show gets four stars is the main love story between Dita and Hibiki.  It starts out like you would expect, they don't really get along and gradually learn to love each other, blah blah.  The only problem is there is not much thawing on Hibiki's part so that by the end of the series they really didn't seem to have progressed a lot beyond where they started.  Maybe it is too much to expect, but I would like to have seen something a little more from the show in that department.  Besides that it really is a fun show and at 26 episodes it's not too long.  Honestly, they probably could have made it 50 and it would have been better for the time to grow.

8336930,4,B001R0AYI0,"First off, I do love the show Vandread, so this is not a review of the show itself but rather of the set (since the show would get 5 for 5 stars).

The set is rather bare-bones, with the only options being English or Japanese stereo and optional English subtitles. Fortunately, all I wanted was Japanese with English subtitles (best way to watch it IMO). However, the setup to change the options is much worse than it sounds. I generally have to select my options 2-3 times before it actually works (not once so far through 2 playthroughs has it worked first try). I select the correct options but they don't properly work, such as having no subtitles or English with subtitles. That would drag the set down to a 3-star but you can watch all the episodes at once, so you only need to mess with it once per disk, but it is still a large nuisance.",1309046400,,845,4.348101265822785
