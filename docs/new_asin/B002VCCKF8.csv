8381887,5,B002VCCKF8,"This DVD is awesome. If you like Retro Games, Nintendo, and/or Famicom Dojo's show, buy this DVD. If you want to know if you would like it, the episodes are on YouTube. This DVD also has special features like commentary, bloopers, and alternate scenes that are exclusive to the DVD. The DVD is worth the price and you should buy it.",1421798400,,332,4.459016393442623
8381888,5,B002VCCKF8,"To any fan of video games (retro and modern), I highly suggest this DVD.  Not only will you learn a lot about the Famicom/NES (among other things), but the comedy is great as well.  I've watched the content on this DVD in its entirety three times and I still find it extremely enjoyable.  You won't go wrong with this!",1318636800,2,318,4.3559322033898304
8381889,5,B002VCCKF8,"I bought Famicom Dojo Season 1 after watching the episodes online. It was great to be able to watch the episodes on my TV whenever I wanted. One look at this DVD and I can tell it was a labor of love. It was well made, informative, and entertaining.
There's so much history here and Sean and Vinnk know their stuff. Any Nintendo fan worth their salt needs this disc.
On top of all the fun information you get, the guys throw in lots of little extras. There's the commentary, coverage of the 2007 Tokyo Game Show, the launch of the Wii, bloopers, promos, and DVD-ROM content.
I'm telling you there is ALOT of bang for your buck. This thing is so good, I'm thinking of pre-ordering Season 2!",1309824000,4,689,4.348837209302325
8381890,5,B002VCCKF8,I was expecting a little more of the DVD...but this is a YOUTUBE season 1.  There are times when its a little slow...but it's full of SO much information.  The episodes are around 7 minutes long.  There are 6 episodes.  They all have a commentary option.  They are independent in everything they do and have great sound effects.  I love their artwork and menus but the aspect ratio on my player cuts off some of the left side of play.  But the price of the DVD cannot be beat the episodes range to about 45 minutes without the extras and I have not seen this kind of information anywhere else.  But as usual the TALKING CONSOLES are enough of a sale on their own.  I cannot wait for season 2.,1281312000,2,692,4.2615384615384615
8381891,5,B002VCCKF8,"When I first started to watch these guys do their show via YouTube, I was floored by how knowledgeable they were.  Who are these guys?  And how do they know so darn much?  When I found out that they were the authors of several Wikipedia pages on the subject of retro videogame systems, I couldn't have been LESS shocked.  I mean, they practically know it all.  But that's not why you should buy this DVD set.  You should buy it, because it has been made with a LOT of love and care.  You should buy it, because all this information is delivered to you in a very humorous and hip format.  Imagine if the Saturday Night Live cast decided to act out the Wikipedia page for the 8-bit Famicom or NES (only funnier)!

So why should you buy this DVD if you can just watch all of their episodes on YouTube?  Well, besides the simple fact that you should support people who go out of their way to deliver such an amazing product, for such a nominal fee.  You not only get the episodes, but you also get commentary for each one, and you get the various specials that they have made.

If you grew up in the 8-bit era, as I did, then this show will give you a ""behind the scenes"" expose on what made those systems and their games so special.  If you're new to the subject of retro games, then this is an excellent primer for you.  Either way, the info contained within is excellent, and has never been delivered to you in such a delightful manner.",1262995200,4,1435,4.247232472324724
8381892,5,B002VCCKF8,I would highly recommend this DVD to any gamer interested in the history of gaming.  Contains a great mix of comedy and information.,1257379200,8,132,4.739130434782608
