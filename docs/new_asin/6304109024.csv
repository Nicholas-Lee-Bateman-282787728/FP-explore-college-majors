7861542,5,6304109024,was  good to remember what I used to watch on Sat.  mornings.  Amazing to see Peter graves a a very young man,1358985600,,109,3.8636363636363638
7861543,5,6304109024,"Wow!  Took me back to my black and white childhood on Sat. mornings.  Just as I remembered it ( although a bit hokey by today's standards).  Very predictable (Lassie in horseflesh), but the acting is good and Fury is everyone's dream horse. VERY 50's with the woman's role clearly defined as caretaker and wise sage, but the memories the music alone stirred up were well worth it.",1183334400,7,380,4.641791044776119
7861544,5,6304109024,"I've had this movie since right after it came out, and I've probably watched it at least 30 times since. I have yet to see a tornado film that beats this, in terms of ""live-action"" footage.  And to go along with that, as another reviewer mentioned, the film is also very informative, explaining how tornados form, etc. It runs just under an hour, but there is plenty of footage in that amount of time, with many different tornados, even ""silent"" historical footage shot in the '50s. A steal at this price.",992217600,4,505,4.549450549450549
