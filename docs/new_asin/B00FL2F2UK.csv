5998439,4,B00FL2F2UK,"Michael Landon Jr.(MLJ) delivers the next part of the Ultimate Gift.  Based on Jim Stovall's successful novel,  this movie emphasizes the importance of family and love over just money as seen through the saga of a rags to riches grandfather and the recipient of his riches, his grandson.

I am a newbie to this series, having not read the book or seen the movie; however, I had no problem following the tale and the obvious message.  The grandson(this time played by handsome Logan Bartholomew- who has done other MLJ movies) is under pressure trying to run Grandpa's(James Garner- seen briefly via video) company.  His courtship with the love of his life(again played by Ali Hillis- she remains me of Amy Grant) hits a roadblock of conflict as she needs more and decides to head to Haiti to work as a nurse.

The grandson flounders trying to keep balance in his life and to value what's really important.  He receives from long time family friend(another great veteran actor- Bill Cobbs) his granddad's journal.  Here, the story flashes back and relates the deceased patriarch's story- a Carnegie success of rising out of poverty by hard work ethic and determination.  We see the young man through thick and thin including hopping a freight train, working menial jobs but making an impression(with Peter Fonda), a brief scene of fighting in WWII and trying to strike it rich in the oil fields with neglected family in tow.

All along, we know what's going to happen; there are no great revelations here, typical for this genre; although, I have to give MLJ a lot of credit for tying all these time periods and changing actors together, and doing it quite well for a pretty limited budget(I believe~3 million).  The filming is well done, and the actors solid enough.  This is a pleasant journey with drama, humor, moral theme and the veteran cameos(also must not forget, Lee Meriwether).

They bundle it in a nice, family friendly, PG package, young kids will be bored, and the extras include a brief making of the movie, interviews with cast including Peter Fonda (giving us his take on life), deleted scenes and a music video.  Overall, if you appreciate MLJ movies, you'll love this one.",1387584000,33,2190,4.820855614973262

5998441,5,B00FL2F2UK,"this is a family movie and it's great to watch.  I have the ultimate gift movie as well.  people get so caught up in the material things and money and thinks that's makes someone happy. these movies both show that happiness is not money, power or fame it's the people who you have in your life and in your corner that will stick by you no matter what.  a little story; some friends of ours has 2 kids they both worked all the time never spending time with there kids.  gave the kids everything they wanted, cars, money, clothes...etc they didn't have to work for anything.  both kids have never went to college lives from house to house wherever someone will let them stay no money nothing and these kids are about to be in there 30's.  they always ask us how we are so close to our kids and how did we get them to be successful.  answer; they had to work for what they wanted it wasn't handed to them so we spent time teaching how to get and keep what you have and that the most important thing it's not how much you have, it's how happy are you.",1387238400,22,1047,4.153465346534653

5998479,3,B00FL2F2UK,"Vendor did well, we received it in a timely manner. This movie, however, like the other sequel, is not like the first of the series, ""The Gift"". This production engaged a hugely different director from the genius motivating ""The Gift"", the first in the series - which makes a telling difference in the quality of acting and production. A superficial production, even in the script,  based on a less engaging/believable storyline. A few of the original cast from 'The Gift' who are actually capable of engaging their parts and making a production come alive - make cameo appearances. Sad. Acting in the sequels is more like:  'I show up for work, look good, speak my bit, & leave' type acting. Not the ensemble feel of the first production - that's a director's gift as well as casting's call.
If we'd seen the sequels before seeing ""The Gift"", we'd never have been interested in watching it. ""The Gift"" is a regular holiday favorite for our entire family - a most remarkable, deeply interesting, well-acted, well-scripted, well-thought-out and produced film, believable and viscerally real, with a great variety of locations. Great messages, well-depicted scenes.",1497744000,2,1163,5.052083333333333

Previously I had seen ""The Ultimate Gift"" and enjoyed it so much that I quite naturally hoped ""The Ultimate Life"" would be satisfying and enjoyable as well. Not so. This sequel was, in my opinion, poorly written. Not only was the pace disturbingly slow, but the way it was done overall was, to me, highly irritating. I watched it for only the first few minutes and could take no more. Possibly if there were enough good quality in those first few minutes to show promise of a better movie overall, I would have stayed with it. Because I had seen and greatly enjoyed Logan Bartholomew's acting in other movies, my expectations for his performance in this one were high. However, in all honesty my advice to other potential viewers of this one is: buyer beware! If you appreciate movies that are well written, directed and performed, look for another and avoid this one.",1417046400,,1101,4.651282051282052

I spent the entire movie Ultimate Life trying to figure out the story line,  who was who and WHEN according to the synopsis the billionaire was going to use his grandfather's journal to figure out his course in life.  That journal and decision didn't show up until the last couple of minutes. I'm so glad I bought the dvd of the Ultimate Gift mainly because of James Garner, rest in peace, but also because of Amanda Byne, who I hope will find peace because she is incredibly talented!

5998886,4,B00FL2F2UK,"""The Ultimate Gift"", the predecessor to this movie ""The Ultimate Life"", has always been one of my favorite movies.  Loved Drew Fuller as Jason and Abigail Breslin, an amazing young talent, was excellent as Emily Rose.  It was a fast paced, never a dull moment, entertaining story, which, in my opinion, did not need a sequel.  The iconic James Garner did well in explaining why he needed someone in his family responsible enough to entrust his fortune to.  After putting Jason, Drew Fuller, through a series of tests to find himself and what, ultimately, is the most important thing in life - the gift of giving, Jason proved himself worthy of his inheritance, which was used in part to build a research hospital dedicated to Emily Rose...the daughter of the woman he loved.

That being said, I bought ""The Ultimate Life"" with the anticipation of learning what made ""Red"" tick, and that is what the movie is mostly about...Red's Steven's valuable lessons on what is REALLY important in life.  It jumped around a bit, from Jason's life and his present day struggles, back to the WWII era and Red Steven's life and his all-consuming greed for money, and the development of his friendship with Ted Hamilton (his lawyer who stuck by Red through thick or thin).
 Thank goodness Red kept a journal of his up and down struggles, which was eventually given to Jason by Hamilton.  Jason's study of his grandfather's journal helped teach him the real values in life and ultimately brought him the inner peace and happiness he longed for.

The acting is good, and it's definitely a movie the whole family can enjoy and learn from....happy viewing!",1399075200,10,1636,4.814285714285714

In the first movie Red calls Hampton (the lawyer) because he has some ""business ideas"", in this one it's because he has a court case.  The director started to develop so many story lines and only finished 1 that it made the movie cheap.  I think it could have been done so much better.

5998978,4,B00FL2F2UK,"My only criticism of the film was that the father of the main character was portrayed as a really good guy, but in the original film he was impulsive at best and rebellious at worst-which cost him his life. In other words, the two stories didn't tie together very well. I also would have liked the same actor for the main part in both films.  Not that the new guy didn't do a good job; I just liked the original actor.",1389052800,,418,4.160493827160494

5998993,5,B00FL2F2UK,"When I first saw the disc and read the synopsis fully along with seeing the stills from the film, I wasn't so sure it was going to be as good as I initially hoped. I admit, being a Peter Fonda fan, he is a HUGE part of why I wanted to see it. At this point, it looked like a made-for-tv movie to me.
Man, I was wrong!
Charming, heartwarming, emotional, and lovely are just some of the words I can use to describe this movie. Circled around the life of an incredible man, his story is told from his journal through the eyes of his grandson. He is passed on when this happens, which puts more emphasis on it all too.
I tell ya, this movie has the same qualities of 'The Notebook' or 'Big Fish'. That story within a story, with love, so much love. Gets me every time.
This movie has such a strong message of love and importance of family relationships. It's also romantic enough for date night. I just really loved it!",1388534400,,915,4.175141242937853

5998995,3,B00FL2F2UK,"This is a well intentioned followup to the superior Ultimate Gift that doesn't quite work. The lead change is jarring enough, but the film tells a story I really think didn't need to be fleshed out this much. If Red Stevens' back story had been interspersed more evenly with Jason's, it might have been somewhat more satisfying. Production values are not bad for a low budget production and the performances are heartfelt. However, as accomplished a director as he is, I'm not sure Michael Landon, Jr. was the best choice for this material.",1388534400,,540,4.817204301075269

When The Ultimate Life was released in the theaters in the late summer of 2013 I found that it was playing in a theater 45 miles away. My wife and I could not find time to go see it together.  After feeling disappointed at missing it, I was thrilled to see it on Amazon and bought it as a Christmas present and watched it Christmas day. If you have watched The Ultimate Gift  and loved it as much as I did, I beg you NOT to watch The Ultimate Life so that you can retain that uplifting feeling.
The Actors could not make up for the bad writing, set design and location. The movie is a look back in the life of Red Stevens. A character portrayed in the first movie by James Garner. This film sequel had so much potential to better than the first. It appears to have been limited by a low budget and poor editing. It jumps around and does not flow.
This epic failure can only be an attempt to make money off of an unsuspecting public. This movie reminds me of why I no longer tune into the SciFy channel on Saturday nights. I will offer this movie back to Amazon for a dollar, . . .if they pay the postage.",1388016000,12,1159,4.078947368421052

I am usually patient with even a B movie, but (spoiler alert) a few minutes into the movie, I thought, something is not right - do this scriptwriter and director have any sense?  This rich guy dates a girl and asked the secretary to send in a dress?  What old fashion idea, no one is doing that.  Then came the moment I stopped - The guy was creating all this wonderful atmosphere to propose, at night time, and broke off just because he got a lawyer's letter that his family members are suing him?  What!  You finish the proposal, have the nice dinner, and take care of business the next morning!  For crying out loud - your personal life should continue while you can work during the day.  There should be no story if I am the girl, what a stupid idiot!  Especially when he was pacing before she came, he said I have been waiting for this moment, etc.  Just so unbelievable and I deem it unwatchable!",1525219200,,1052,4.343589743589743
