4334735,5,B004DURSNA,"I have been waiting for this to be available. I was in the Northridge Earthquake and it is featured in this set of disasters. Scenes on DVD, that are real and things that never made the local Los Angeles news on TV. I was surprised to see it available on Amazon. I didn't know it existed. I believe everybody should own this DVD. When will the BIG ONE hit?",1379203200,4,356,4.173913043478261
4334736,4,B004DURSNA,A good collection of disasters of the past and the possibilities in the future. Good quality DVD.  Recommend for those that enjoy this genre.,1371600000,4,141,4.875
4334737,1,B004DURSNA,"It shows pictures of natural disasters and then does scenario on ""what if it hit a big city"". WHAT??? Means nothing and I so hoped it was going more into natural disasters rather than an hour apiece on ""what if'. One is ""what if"" NY got hit by Katrina Hurricane, another ""what if"" LA got hit with SF Earthquake today. Well ""what if"" the Sun doesn't rise tomorrow? Makes as much sense. ONLY History I have not liked one bit",1365206400,,422,4.2875
4334738,5,B004DURSNA,"Anyone who's ever seen a ""Mega Disaster"" episode knows it's one of The History Channel's most ambitious series - as well as one of its most ""apocalyptic.""  You hear the expression ""when, not if"" at just about every turn.  This is my favorite History Channel series - which is why I'm willing to buy it even though I've seen every episode; but even I find myself thinking every once in a while ""Hey guys, tone it down just a bit, ok?  We get the picture.  This is bad stuff.""  This trend toward the apocalyptic is so firmly entrenched in ""Mega Disasters"" that even when the episode itself contains scientific testimony downplaying the odds of the disaster happening, they still can't help making the prediction ""it will happen, it's just a question of when.""  Case in point: the ""Windy City Tornado"" episode clearly states that the kind of Super Tornado outbreak causing a tornado to hit the Chicago suburb of Oak Lawn in 1967 was a once in a century event - followed by the same predictable dire prediction: it could happen tomorrow.

What you get here is a ""Cry Wolf"" situation which actually undercuts the far more immediate dangers posed by some of the potential ""Mega Disasters"" - such as that presented in ""The Next Pompeii.""  The evidence clearly shows the city of Naples, Italy to be at serious risk should Mt. Vesuvius erupt again, backed up by evidence that Vesuvius has alternated since the 79 AD eruption between major and minor eruptions - and that it's time for a major eruption.  This is truly a ""when, not if"" scenario.

The best two episodes feature more generic disasters: ""Mega Drought"" and ""Mega Freeze.""  These are tied to climate change but don't engender the standard ""when, not if"" paradigm.  Nonetheless these are the most harrowing in that they involve huge areas rather than specific locations. ""Mega Drought"" would hit southwest and mid-west America hardest; ""Mega Freeze"" would hit eastern United States and Europe hardest.

The History Channel has pulled out all the stops in their computer graphics and scientific assessments for this series.  Needless to say, there's danger and action enough for even the die-hard sci-fi enthusiast; but it's not ""in your face"" action: rather, it's tailored to assaults by nature rather than by alien invaders. You get scared out of your wits - but don't have to endure the hero or heroine stumbling over a tree stump while trying to flee the monster.  How good is that!",1345161600,14,2435,4.805755395683454

Asteroid Apocalypse
Atlantis Apocalypse
American Volcano
The Next Pompeii
Windy City Tornado
New York City Hurricane
LA's Killer Quake

Three stars because I'd have chosen different episodes. But it's a good value, considering what they charge for individual episodes. I hope this helps.",1302048000,44,426,5.343283582089552

4334755,5,B004DURSNA,"I am a HUGE fan of discovering the many mysteries interwoven but not with depth in text books. I elarned as a teacher by the time a history text book makes it to the classroom it is about a decade behind what science and other investigators have discovered. The same is true with mega disasters. This multi-disc set shows the many places throughout the world where man has erected his many civilized edifices on are standing due to the whims of Mother Nature...and one day mother Nature will take exception.

The science I learn via these discs was never taugth to me in either my school science or my college science. WHY? I cannot recommend these discs highly enough for those of us who would ahve loved learning it in school...It would ahve held my attention much more than the dry recitations of OLD science I got...and those who want to see, thanks to the amazing magic of computer graphics TODAY'S presentations of what really happens beneath our feet and above our heads when mother nature decides she is in a modern snit. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the History Channels releases.",1433721600,,1077,4.668421052631579

4334757,2,B004DURSNA,"I found the episodes boring, repetitive with reviews of previous material from right before the obvious commercial breaks. The material was over-sensationalized while providing very little depth to enable real understanding.  You could tell they were just trying to pad out the length with the numerous repetitions of the same material.",1433289600,2,336,5.588235294117647

4334760,5,B004DURSNA,"While I do not think any of these disasters will happen in my lifetime, (or rather, I sure HOPE they don't!!) it is always good to be aware of what COULD happen. Being prepared for any widespread emergency means being prepared for just about any catastrophe. We have no hurricanes or forest fires where I live, but there are grass fires, blizzards and tornadoes. The New Madrid fault is less than 250 miles from me and I'm downrange of the Yellowstone Caldera. Asteroids and comets can hit anywhere at any time. Some of these disasters are not survivable, but some are and the key to getting through such an event is prior knowledge of them combined with prior preparation. This DVD contains descriptions of ten BIG problems that could happen, and whether you are looking to get ready or just like to scare yourself, I think you will enjoy watching it.",1403654400,7,852,4.6490066225165565

8426161,1,B004DURSNA,"Mega Disasters is a disaster of epic proportions. I lived in Western Washington when St. Helens blew in 1980 and have visited the National Monument several times since. I was born and raised in the Puyallup valley on the sediment left by an old mud flow from Rainier. I flew around Rainier not long after St. Helens blew and noted the remnants of a much older version of Rainier, one that must have stood many thousands of feet higher.

The Mega Disaster that centers on Rainier is filled with Chicken Little, ""The Sky if Falling"" fear mongering that, while it holds some truth, is far overblown, not on the potential for disaster, but how far reaching the effects could be on Seattle (which does not sit on mud flow from Rainier. The prevailing winds are from the ocean and it would take a southerly blow to create the kind of problems that this show presents as a portend for a Seattle disaster.

Add to that the repetitive nature of the episodes, as if they want to brainwash the watcher into a sense of paranoia, and this could not be a worse example of television documentaries. History (part of the A&E networks) needs to pull this series and take it out behind the barn and not only shoot it, but bury it in an unmarked grave.",1452038400,,1233,4.475555555555555
