It was definitely beginner level, but did have options if you were a little more advanced. It lasts about 45 minutes. The instructor was pleasant to listen to and gave excellent instruction. I felt like I walked a little taller after I did it!  :) When I get more advanced, I will definitely purchase the next DVDs in this series!",1496361600,3,499,4.297872340425532
8016803,5,B0001WANV8,"This was a real surprise. I have the Winsor pilates dvds and was expecting this to be a little different. This program is so much better produced and the instructor is way better. It is shot in a beautiful loft and the music is perfect - more instrumental jazz and world, not regular exercise music. The best thing is the instructor really gives you details on how to learn the technique without slowing down the workout. And it is a full class, covering more than most basic Pilates tapes. I also like the names of the exercises written on the screen. The opening intro is a nice history of Pilates and where it came from. Overall, this is just better and more than the other programs. Kudos to Jonathan!",1186444800,32,705,4.4728682170542635
