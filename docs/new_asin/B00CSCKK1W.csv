So instead of an actual review, I will give you a synopsis of the show, because Amazon doesn't seem to have one yet:

It's a sitcom about a college kid. He used to be a star quarterback, but a car wreck ended his college football career before it began. He is attending a local community college and trying to figure out how his new faith in Jesus Christ impacts his life.

The DVD contains 6 episodes and covers the first semester of Blake Goodman's college career.

Ep1- Pilot
Ep2- Love One Another
Ep3- Exclusions
Ep4- Love & Sex
Ep5- Jesus in a Bubble
Ep6- Choices",1373932800,,616,4.37719298245614
8652550,5,B00CSCKK1W,"This is a must buy for Christians, especially young adults! There is no show out there like this in Christian television and they need your support. This show doesn't shy away from the tough issues like most of Christian television. The topics are relevant and brought up in an entertaining way. And it's quite funny lol. GET YOUR COPY! Trust me you won't regret it.",1373932800,,366,4.6461538461538465
