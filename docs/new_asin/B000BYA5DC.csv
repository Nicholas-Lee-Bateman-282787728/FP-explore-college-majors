2445642,5,B000BYA5DC,"I Really Love This Movie Mosly Because of The Great Tan-Tao Liang, The The and Most Ultimate Leg Fighter/Kicker on The Screen or in Life, And Shaw Brothers Legend Chi-Kaun Chun. The Only Knock I Have on This Movie is That My Favorite Star(Mr Tan)is The Bad Guy And of All His Movies This One Offers The Best He's Used His Kicks/Leg Techniques-The Shaolin Deadly Kicks And The Fact That I Can Not Find This Movie Any-Where in ""ENGLISH VERSION"" or English Dubbed. But Man What Action...",1171497600,,484,4.574712643678161
2445643,5,B000BYA5DC,"this movie got some of the greatest raw kung fu action in the late '70s.  It has a decent story about revenge.  the leading star took number of kung fu booses who take his challenge including a wutang clan leader who happens to be a master of leg kicks.  The hero is good at using his arm skills while the wutang leader has an oustanding leg form that is very effective in combat ( witness it for urself )...if u want a good story line that is packed with raw kung fu action in every corner then check this movie out....The Dvd is widescreen, sometimes subtitle is hard to read becuase it blends in the films' color.  The picture of the film is not great but is acceptable since it is a 70's classic.",1168905600,,700,4.201492537313433
2445644,5,B000BYA5DC,"Rarescope is the newest and probably best brand out there now for die hard kung fu fans.

This first film is ultra rare and is well deserving to be it's premiere title.

Apparently this was considered a lost film due to lawsuits,etc. but Rarescope cut through the red tape and gives us a classic.

Chi Kwan Chun who starred in many Shaw Brothers films is the lead.

Bonis features include an interview with him(he looks almost the same)and a kung fu demonstration too.

The film is shown in it's original chinese language,english subtitled version .

It is presented in letterbox format and the print quality is very good,but not excellent.

The U.S. version apparently has an outer sleeve and a bonus postcard with poster art and photos from the film.

An absolute must for the collection if you're into classic martial arts films!

 Just get Rarescope!",1137110400,4,854,4.787671232876712

8094039,5,B000BYA5DC,Of course the main event plot of this movie was Shaolin disciple Hu Hui-chien vs. Kao Hsin-chung(Chi Kuan-chun vs. Tan Tao-liang). And this was also the one time that we ever saw Tan Tao-liang play a villain role here.,1419552000,,218,4.615384615384615
8094040,4,B000BYA5DC,"Having read of the apparent [recent] collapse of BCI/Eclipse, this movie might languish in this DVD form ONLY,and that's [potentially] a real shame. It deserves to be remastered anew by another company because, as of now, this version is not: 1)anamorphic widescreen, and 2)either digital enhancement of the original subtitles or newly-written subtitles would enhance this movie that is Shaw Brothers in spirit, if not in name. Everyone should email Navarre to put some serious money in a new remastering. If there's this much interest in this flick, then maybe Tarantino could be persuaded to give them a loan of a few million to get the film as close to a Celestial Shaw remastering as possible. Somebody needs to preserve this movie proper for future generations! In the meantime, buy this with caution. (10/31 revision)",1244678400,,823,5.103703703703704
8094041,4,B000BYA5DC,"Tao Tangs kicks are exceptional while Chi Kuan Chun fists match him hand to toe, good story movie keeps your interest and the fight scenes are very well done a 4 star feature.",1237939200,,175,4.333333333333333
8094042,5,B000BYA5DC,"a truely great kung fu flick. great fight scenes from beginning to end. pretty good story line too. for some reason i loved the fact that it moved between black and white and color throughout the movie. it made me feel like i was watching a real old school classic. but in reality its not that old. its just bad conversion to dvd format i think. again i emphasize the kung fu being top notch, i was very surprised i never heard of it before downloading it. i had to buy it and add it to the collection. for any collector reading this, buy it and feel good that its part of the collection..:)",1221523200,,591,4.192982456140351
8094043,3,B000BYA5DC,"This film was excavated from a vault and seeing the transfer it is definitely believable, wasn't sure if this thing was black and white, almost color?, yep, it is color, and this is also in Chinese with hard to read subtitles and 16x9 widescreen. This film, 1978, is supposedly rare and stands to be one of the best martial arts films out there, Shaw Brothers star, Chi Kuan-Chun, flat out shows us how martial arts is done with authority, kicking a-- throughout the entire film with a vengeance, there's no slacking in this one folks, ""Showdown at the Cotton Mill"", from Rarescope is a must, also featuring interviews with the actors, who are real martial artist...three stars for the crappy transfer and hard to read subtitles...the film itself rocks.",1221004800,,753,4.844961240310077
8094044,3,B000BYA5DC,"The action in this movie is on par or better then most movies of its time.  The story is relatively easy to follow as well.  The big problem with this movie is the transfer is really rough and jumpy in some places.  In one spot the coloration of the movie goes a little crazy and becomes a greenish yellow and most of the detail is lost.  Also lost in many spots are the subtitles.  White subtitles on light / white backgrounds are difficult, if not impossible, to read.

It's a movie worth owning, but it is also worth waiting for a better transfer to come along.",1207785600,,564,4.273584905660377
8094045,3,B000BYA5DC,"Chi Kuan-Chun (""The Ways of Kung Fu"") plays Hu Hui Chien, hero of Shaolin and bitter enemy of the Wu-Tang.  After numerous assassination attempts and the infiltration of Shaolin all fail, the Wu-Tang send in Master Ko (Dorian Tan) and his powerful kicks to finish Hu off.

This movie is pretty good.  The fights won't blow anyone away, but they're fluid and interesting.  Chi Kuan Chun's movements are solid and impressive.  The story is decent too.  Chang Cheh's ""2 Champions of Shaolin"" (starring the Venoms) is VERY similar to this, and has a couple of scenes that are nearly identical.

Though I own (far too) few of their releases, I'm really starting to like Rarescope.  This one was considered lost when they salvaged it.  Though it is subtitled only and they are often difficult to read, I'll take this over nothing, any old day.  It's also in widescreen, as all fu should be.  The first couple of minutes are very choppy but settles quickly.  The DVD has a few special features, including an interview from 2005 with Chi Kuan-Chun and Ching Kuo-Chung, an older Tae Kwon Do exhibition from Dorian Tan, and a 5 Animal Style demonstration from Chi Kuan-Chun, along with previews for some other Rarescope releases.  Features are cool, but the movie is much more of a treat.

1978.  aka:  ""Bold Face, Heart and Blood""",1206835200,4,1321,4.753303964757709
8094046,5,B000BYA5DC,I liked the movie but I wish it was in English.  The fight scenes was good.  The quality of the movie was good too.  Amazon has fast service and I did not have to wait over three days to receive the movie.  I enjoyed their service,1173312000,,230,3.9347826086956523
