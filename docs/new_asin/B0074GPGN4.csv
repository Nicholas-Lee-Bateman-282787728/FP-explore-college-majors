8509924,5,B0074GPGN4,"this is the most aligned era of the doctor who tv series. Yet. I find it very enjoyable. And Ace was a great companion. The show was not cancelled due to ratings either.  The sick wierdos at the bbc at the time wanted to do NEW things mainly. These two adventures find the doctor and Ace up against more evil baddies. The effects are of their day of course. So it does NO good to compalin about older movies special effects.  That's a waste of time. I have most episode of Doctor who on dvd . so this was a must have for me.  It's worth getting but this is the uk version , so you MUST have a all region blu ray player to watch it.  Mine does dvd's , 3d blu's and all other blu's from anywhere.",1476489600,,694,3.971223021582734

8509926,5,B0074GPGN4,"Have you seen the price for the American issue of Dragonfire? That should let you know what a deal this is. Always a fan of the story as it was really the only ""Traditional story"" in McCoy's first season. As for The Happiness Patrol....Bar none this is the WORST story in Who history and it doesn't matter what you may think is worse than this, there's no such thing.",1468540800,,367,4.333333333333333
