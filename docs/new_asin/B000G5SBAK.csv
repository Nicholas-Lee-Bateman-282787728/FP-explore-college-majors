8410999,3,B000G5SBAK,"The demos are done by a lady who obviously knows what she is doing. From the first scene in her kitchen you can tell that it truly is a Russian kitchen.  The pastries demoed are authentically Russian.  However, the quality of the DVD itself leaves much to be desired.  I was able to start it on my Win XP, but after pausing it once, I was never able to restart it.  In fact, my whole system freezes when I try to run this DVD now.  Fortunately, my husband has a Mac, and I can watch the DVD that way.  The company that puts it out claims that they test their DVD's on a lot of different configurations, but they are not responsible if it doesn't work on yours.  And they won't replace it if you've opened the wrapping, but you won't know if you can watch it on your computer unless you unwrap it!  The English speaker mispronounces some words, although it is possible to follow the flow based on context.  I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in authentic Russian cooking, but be warned that you may run into serious trouble trying to watch the DVD!",1172188800,,1063,4.301507537688442
