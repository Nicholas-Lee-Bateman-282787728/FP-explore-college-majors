8405056,5,B003TEN88K,"Marlowe's TRAGEDY OF DOCTOR FAUSTUS is probably the must famous Elizabethan play not written by Shakespeare -- and justly so. Essentially, FAUSTUS set the bar for later playwrights. However, it is a demanding play, calling for both a powerful actor in the lead and an array of special effects. The hero's speeches are often long and difficult and the comic scenes have not aged well. Thus the play is rarely performed (at least in the US).
This DVD captures a remarkably original and inventive production by the Greenwich Theatre of London. Gareth Kennerly is well cast as the young, ambitious, and tortured hero. As Mephistopholes, Tim Treolar brings both energy and irony to his line readings. Since these two actors are on-stage for almost the entire action, it is a tribute to their versatility and range as well as their stamina. The rest of the cast, all doubling and tripling parts, performs at the same high level. I have always found the clown scenes a trial to read, but the actors here actually make some of them work. The dirctor and crew successfully realize the magical effects.
All in all, this is production is a small gem. And if you are an instructor looking for a video of FAUSTUS for a class, this version is far superior to the 1967 Burton/Taylor/Coghill version. --
