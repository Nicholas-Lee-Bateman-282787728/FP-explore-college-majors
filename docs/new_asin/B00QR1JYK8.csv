8692367,2,B00QR1JYK8,I must start by saying the main menu is a sadistic masterpiece of chaos. The audio in the film might be the best part of the film. Intensifying added audio sound. And the subtle music and death metal fits very well. But the audio recording of them speaking is very poor quality. Understandable but when they tell you can hear it's about to pop some times. The special effects are kinda poopie. A couple cool visual effect like for instance when the girl is crawling up the bed. Basic but visually satisfying  But the way they use the ropes is oddly satisfying to watch. And I really like the woman's mask. If you like simulated torture. Not much of a story to follow. And blood this film will be very enjoyable for you. It barley has shock value.  Or maybe I've just been permenetly numbed by all the lucifer valentine videos. Anyway petty cool ending even tho nothing happened. I like these kinda movie but I know most people won't. 5 outta 10,1494374400,,944,4.4508670520231215

8692369,1,B00QR1JYK8,"Waste of time and money, worst indie film ever, that's what it is.

I know this kind of movies not necessarily includes a great plot and screenplay but at least should be offer something surprisingly graphic on their content, well it doesn't. Even worse the acting is poor same with the dialogues everything looks like it's been improvised but pretty bad because is not script on this crappy movie. I wish i could get my money back it doesn't worth even a penny",1443398400,2,461,4.554216867469879

8692371,4,B00QR1JYK8,"This film took me by surprise. Just goes to show what a few dollars, some blood (ok a lot of blood) and some creativity can go a long way and make for some brutal art in the process. This reminded me a little bit of Maniac with some rope torture and demonic possession thrown in for good measure. Not a lot of dialogue so the subtitles shouldn't stop anyone from checking this out. Really loved 'Judas' the creature on the cover. Very creepy character with sick voice effects. A very intense and violent film.",1435536000,4,509,4.425531914893617
8692372,3,B00QR1JYK8,This films bounces back and forth and is very brutal with English subtitles. The movie is a bit hard to follow at first until you see that it bounces back and forth in time as you are reading the screen while trying to watch the film. If you like violent films give it a look.,1432339200,,276,4.036363636363636
8692373,4,B00QR1JYK8,"Great addition to the unearthed films library! Really bloody, great camera work, creepy editing,  good performances from the actors. Just a well done, different, brutal overall film. Watch with caution. It isn't anything like anything you've seen.",1430956800,4,247,5.675675675675675
