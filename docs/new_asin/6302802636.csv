513900,5,6302802636,"It's alway risky business for a filmaker to try to improve upon a film so beloved as the original Gregory Peck version of ""The Yearling"".  The viewer won't be disappointed with this remake.  Beautiful photography and wonderful acting by all.  The bargain price of this double-feature makes it a real value. Note: Rick Schroeder is in the other feature (Call Of The Wild) on this dvd; he does not appear in The Yearling.  Add this one to your library of family films.",1342569600,3,466,4.646341463414634
513901,5,6302802636,"The movie is great and it shows with sincerity the real deal of the novel. I liked the music andthe backgrounds of the nature. The film was done in a very interesting way. This film used very nice places in Alaska and the environment reflected what you expect to see in the movie about the novel. Buck is great and the dog used in this movie is very smart and strong. The main characters did a nice job in acting their plays and I like that the cast used people who really fitted the characters of the novel like the Native Americans. Great movie recomended!

This movie is available in dvd now. I got in in .b.e.s.t.b.u.y. at a good price.",1336262400,3,640,4.289256198347108
513902,1,6302802636,"I expected better of Jack London's work. The Call of the Wild may have many versions and may be a classic, but in truth, it's a horrid story of a German Shepherd that was abused, whipped, forced to pull heavy sleds, starved, and neglected. A story like ""The Plague Dogs"" may be alot like this, but ""The Plague Dogs"" was sending a message to stop animal abuse. This wasnt. Buck is a German Shepherd that was bounced around owner to owner throughout the film. A part in the film that really made me mad was how much Jack London dragged the scene out where Buck and other dogs are forced to pull a heavy sled that even horses couldn't pull. The scene where Buck falls in the snow, bloody and the musher whips the dog makes it too much to bear. Then even though a man comes along and rescues Buck, we see the others dogs die in a frozen lake that broke. The only good owner Buck has even made Buck pull heavy things to prove to the town ""How amazing he was"". But even in the end Buck loses his owner. So there isn't even a happy ending. The film is terrible.",1315440000,10,1054,4.171568627450981
513903,5,6302802636,"In regard to The Yearling, no, it isn't the late 1940's movie version starring Gregory Peck and Jane Wyman, but it's an excellent remake.  Peter Strauss and Jean Smart are excellent in the lead roles.  Anyway, I had this version on VHS and have searched for quite a while to find it on DVD so I'm glad to find this and the added bonus of a second movie, too.  I can't imagine anyone familiar with Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings work finding this production disappointing in any way.",1294790400,12,476,4.511627906976744
513904,3,6302802636,"Prospective buyers please note, the version of The Yearling included on this disc is not the 1947 film starring Gregory Peck and Jane Wyman - it's the 1994 made for tv remake starring Peter Strauss, Jean Smart, and Philip Seymour-Hoffman.",1289347200,5,238,4.975
513905,1,6302802636,"At best, the movie was passably done.  The plot was barely recognizable as the plot from Jack London's story.  It had a terrible ending for kids.",1131753600,4,145,4.538461538461538
513989,4,6302802636,"I was very annoyed by call of the wild. I was hoping this was a much older movie, and its my own fault for not checking. In hindsight I wish I had got a different DVD. So I watched the Yearling and it was great. I'm a huge fan of M.K. Rawlings, and I thought this movie was even better then the old one. I would buy this again for the Yearling.",1441238400,,344,3.7916666666666665

513997,4,6302802636,My son (8th grade) had to do some summer reading & we used the DVDs after reading the book to reinforce/discuss plot. He said there were a few things left out of the film but he still enjoyed it.,1377302400,,195,4.0256410256410255
513998,5,6302802636,"I finally got to view this movie today. As stated previously, it was purchased for someone else. I loved it! A beautiful, heartfelt movie, with beautiful scenery. Rick Schroder did a wonderful job as John Thornton. He displayed deep emotion regarding his bond with Buck. Something I can relate to as an animal lover and one who bonds deeply with their pets. There are many lessons to learn from this movie but each will take away what they feel personally applies to them. Frankly, I don't think I could have lasted as John did, but then, you never know, do you? We tried many times to get this movie on DVD, but they were never this one. After finally learning it was available on VHS --- on Amazon --- (where else?) we ordered it and are very glad we did. So thankful for Amazon!",1370390400,4,781,4.430555555555555
