8440749,5,B004TJWDQ2,"I have all the Neverending Story movies and this one is as good as the others. The Never Ending Story is about a boy and a book. As he has adventures they appear in the book. IN this adventure, some evil nasties get the book and make his life miserable but he has a great revenge at the end.  But the movie I bought the set for was A Wrinkle in Time. I wateched it twice already! It is about the children of a man who disappears. They must search for him in time. The adventures they have in finding him and bringing him home are magical.",1461888000,,538,4.02803738317757
