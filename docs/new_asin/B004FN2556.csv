8428014,5,B004FN2556,"The first time my husband and I saw this was on PBS sometime in the 90's. We waited so long for this to become available for purchase that we forgot about it. When I discovered that it is available I bought it immediately. Both my husband and I love the Alaskan wilderness, the families and how each lives. This is an awesome documentary on Alaska and the few families that lived in the area. The lakes, the landscape, the snow.... SPECTACULAR! LOVE IT!",1473379200,,453,4.469879518072289
8428015,5,B004FN2556,Great film.  My husband flew supplies to Hemo and the Haddon family when we lived in Ft Yukon.  So fun to see the families grow and survive in the severe Alaska north.  I miss the Northern Lights and people the most !!!  National Geographic -  tell Hemo and  Richard. Scott and I say hi.  Look us up in Montana !,1429315200,,312,4.1
8428016,5,B004FN2556,"I'am a big fan of the outdoors and Alaska. This story is about 4 families who brave the wilderness and harsh temperatures to make there
living in Alaska. As much as I like hunting, and trapping this isn't recreation. This is survival and not just another series on Alaska. Many
programs that are on tv now showcase the same kind of living. It's nice to sit in your living room and watch these shows and never have to
brave the cold or the rivers to get your next meal. Or go out on a 120 mile trapline to see if you have secured any fur. They have to be checked
or the other animals will rob you. Is this a award rated movie, no. But if you enjoy families living off the grid in the wilderness, then you will
probably enjoy this.",1427760000,2,729,4.140845070422535
8428017,5,B004FN2556,"I had this video for years in VHS format, loved it. Would dust it off and play it about once a year. Though I have lived in some really rough 'lower 48' wilderness, I was truly amazed at the resourcefulness and strength of those who were shown in this excellent documentary. Sadly, almost all shown in the video have left the 'bush' for 'civilization', except for Heimo and his wife. There is a 'VICE' documentary on YouTube done in 2011 that kinda follows up to this documentary, but shows only Heimo and his wife 15-years later. It is a real shame that ANWAR and the Dept. of the Interior won't auction the old 'homesteads' off to a new generation willing to 'walk in Heimo's shoes' - but it appears they are gong to lock up ANWAR and cold-storage it for scientists and rich expedition travelers, instead. Such a shame, and lost heritage. If you like the wild, and Alaska, if you watch nothing else but this one documentary, watch it. This is the one you will remember.",1385683200,,971,4.491525423728813
8428018,5,B004FN2556,"What a splendid Documentary which encapsulates the dramatic distinct Seasons in that part of Alaska. The families featured on this film certainly led active lives considering the harsh extremes of the Seasons. I travelled up to the Northern Coastal plain in the Brooks Range a few years ago, and was privileged to be in the company of , Roger The Bush Pilot , it was  great travelling with a person so well versed on the country, and  Wildlife of Alaska. Roger was tragically killed in the Arctic National Wildlife Range in 1993, about one year to the day following my trip with him. I give this film my high recommendation.",1344988800,2,624,4.663636363636364
8428019,5,B004FN2556,"Hemo is a legend in Alaska, only family still living in ANWR.

It's 100% worth it.  Order some extras and send them to your friends.",1324339200,2,132,4.24
