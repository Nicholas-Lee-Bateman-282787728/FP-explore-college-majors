8180377,4,B000NP3ZU4,"I teach Art History in a small private school to 9th graders. They enjoyed the ""brush-stroke"" effect the artist used in this video. It helped you to see the beauty of Van Goghs painting's if they were made into a video! The first graders also viewed this video and loved it! I would recommend it for all ages. The story is a bit sad.
Great video!",1305676800,3,346,4.257575757575758

It was created based off of Van Gogh's artistic style, post-impressionism.  As a child, I always wondered what it would be like if a painting came to life, and now my dreams have come true with ""Almond Blossoms!""  This is a great story for your children to enjoy and be introduced to the famous painter, Van Gogh.",1257292800,5,726,8.294871794871796
