XV:TRIBUTE TO RANDY COUTURE

1. GRAY MAYNARD VS EVAN DUNHAM-the first round of this fight is very entertaining, both came to fight. Gray takes the round in my opinion but Evan held his own. The second round looks much like the first with Gray winning the round but Evan is holding his own. The third is just as good as the first two but Gray takes the round and the fight due to decision. 5/5

2. CHRIS TRAMMEL VS JOHN KROHN-excellent first round fight here with some great judo throws and submissions attempts. The second round is good as well with some nice high kicks and a good take down, last part of the round the stay clinched. The final round features some good striking and good flurries, this was another good fight. John Krohn takes the decision victory. 4/5

3. PETER ASPENWAL VS MIKE DOLCE-Dolce comes out aggressive in this fight kicking and punching then getting the take down. Good first round with some good strikes but it stays on the ground most of the time. A little better second round with some good submission attempts and Peter evens the fight up. The third round looks like the first round but it was a close round, neither man looked dominate in this fight. Peter takes the decision win in this one. 3.5/5

4. DOMINIC RIVERA VS DAMIEN HATCH-this one is very quick as Hatch hooks in a sick arm bar that taps out Rivera. Really quick yet exciting fight. 5/5

5. DAVE PADILLA VS DENNIS DAVIS-another quick fight that ends by submission when Davis locks Dave in a guillotine choke and taps him out. This is a quick and once again exciting fight, that choke was tight. 5/5

6. RAY PERALES VS EDDY ELLIS-in the first round these two look so evenly matched that it is hard to call who took it. Both reverse each other and get some sweeps. The second round was good as both take it to each other trying to get the win. The third and final looks like the second until Eddy sinks in a rear naked choke and takes the win. 4.5/5

7. BRANDON MELENDEZ VS PAT HEALY-a pretty good opening round that had both pulling out a close call on who won the round. But once it goes to the second round Healy puts a nice rear naked choke on Melendez to secure the victory. This was a pretty good fight over all and had a nice finish. 3.5/5

8. DAVE COCHRAN VS RYAN SCHULTZ-this fight looks and ends just like the last one except with more strikes, Ryan hits Dave with a nice punch and gets the take down. Once there he loosens him up with some punches and gets a submission by rear naked choke. 5/5

9.[FEATHERWEIGHT TITLE]ENOCH WILSON VS IAN LOVELAND-excellent first round as both waste no time getting into as they skip the feeling out process. Standing and on the ground both bring it to each other. The second round looks much like the first but like the last two fights this one ends with a rear naked choke. Enoch takes the main event victory at this tribute for the natural, captain America Randy Couture. 5/5

This was a pretty good event that I think all fans will enjoy, it was cool to see Randy get a farewell like this although he did come back. Plus there are some tips and moves that Randy and Matt Lindland showcase on here.",1237334400,,3151,4.38013698630137
