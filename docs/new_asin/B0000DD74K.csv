Who cares if it is a reissue under a different name - it is a gem of a video with great jazz musicians to boot!
Great vintage Cole!

8361648,1,B0000DD74K,"I purchased this DVD believing that it was an independent item of any other.  However when I viewed the item, what appeared as the title was another video that I own called ""The Incomparable Nat King Cole"" which is a video on its own.  It seems someone had that DVD and just slapped a different label on it.  The vendor though was expedient in returning funds.",1281225600,3,360,4.424242424242424
