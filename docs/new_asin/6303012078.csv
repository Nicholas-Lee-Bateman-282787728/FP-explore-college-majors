7835213,5,6303012078,"Soleri's city was a hot place for Architecture students to intern back in the 70's when I was in school. Today he is still struggling to create his city. While it only sports a few buildings that are a shadow of his original inspiration, his idea of combining living, working, and argricultural space into a green, energy efficient community is probably needed more today then it was thiry years ago. With Global warming slowly destroying the planet as politicians do nothing, Soleri's city concept offers a solution that people can embrace without winning an election. I use the video as part of my Architecture lecture in my Humanities class. Not only is it an interesting chronicle of the project, it is also a good biography of Soleri, a student of Frank Llyod Wright, who lived and worked at Taliesin.",1122508800,,806,4.805755395683454
