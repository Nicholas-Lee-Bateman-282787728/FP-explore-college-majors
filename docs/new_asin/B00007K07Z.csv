1816953,4,B00007K07Z,"Probably the only thing Lorenzo Lamas has done that I was able to take seriously, Takedown is a solid portrayal of a lower working-class teen trying to balance attending high-school with the need to work in order to help support his family. Maureen McCormick plays a classmate who Lamas hopes to...er...'take down'(hee hee). No, actually it's a bittersweet movie about growing up among the have-nots, but finding that what you need was within yourself all along (or some Hallmark card-inspired nonsense like that). Might as well purchase it on VHS, since the likelihood of it ever getting updates to dvd is essentially nil.",1205280000,7,623,5.058252427184466

7977195,4,B00007K07Z,"I saw this movie with my brother back in 1979 at a movie theater in Provo. I remember it well--not only because it starred Marcia Brady (who was the hottie of her day), but because many of my neighbors were extras in the film. I grew up in American Fork, and the movie was filmed at the old AF High School. (I don't think that building even exists anymore.) As a ten-year-old kid, I couldn't believe I was seeing people and places that I knew in a movie!
When I was a teenager and the VHS revolution was upon us, I watched this movie several times with my friends.
But ever since the death of video, I haven't seen it. I wish that someone would put it out on DVD or Blu-Ray. There's so much crap on DVD, why can't something good, clean, and fun like this movie be sold? I'm sure there are many similar gems lost in movie history. I would sure buy a copy. Please, Kieth Merrill, get this produced!",1478131200,2,896,4.184971098265896
7977196,5,B00007K07Z,"This was an incredibly funny and underrated movie,  but NWIH I (or anyone should, or will) pay a bill for a VHS tape. I mean, I get it, buthe good luck with that.",1463011200,,162,3.909090909090909
7977197,4,B00007K07Z,"I was in high school in Salt Lake City and had the privilege to watch part of this movie being filmed. Mr. Merrill as fascinating to watch and he worked so patiently with the hundreds of teenagers filming the last big match. The main actors were quite stand of fish with the exception of Kevin Hooks who came around and spoke to everyone. He was so spent earth and funny. Once the movie came out, I thought it was really well done. You can't help pulling for Nick and t made me a life long fan of Edward Hermann. If you can find it, I highly recommend it. Good for your whole family!  Sure wish it would be available on DVD.",1429401600,,624,4.1570247933884295
7977198,5,B00007K07Z,"The first movie ever made about the sport of wrestling (with a comedic flare)! One of my favorite films from childhood, I would definitely buy it on DVD if I could only find it! Highly recommended!

7977199,4,B00007K07Z,"Corny, yeah.  But lots of fun.  Now that Edward Herrmann has passed, would somebody get a DVD or streaming version of this out to the general public?  And when you do watch it, listen for the line about the ""cleansing bubble"" because I use that to this day.",1419984000,,257,4.3125
7977200,4,B00007K07Z,"This movie is a great movie with Lorenzo Lamas as a High School student, Marcia McCormick as his girl friend, and Edward Herrmann as the coach. Not only does the student grow personally while on the wrestling team, the coach grows as a person while being assigned it to him as an added ""faculty"" responsibility.  It is a clean film able to be shown to the entire family and I would love to see it on DVD.  The current price for an outdated VHS tape of over $300 is unreasonable, but if it came out more realistically priced as a DVD I would definitely purchase it.",1407196800,2,564,4.311320754716981
7977201,5,B00007K07Z,My husband was a wrestler and later a referee. He lived this movie. This film is hard to find.,1406764800,2,94,4.0
7977202,5,B00007K07Z,This is a great movie that our whole family enjoyed in the 70s.  They are in their 40s now and I won't say how old I am but I sure would love to see this movie out in DVD.  The price on the VHS tape is unbelievable and out of the question to purchase.  It hasn't shown up on premimum tv either as far as I know.  Hope it comes back in to print in DVD format.,1317081600,5,358,3.6103896103896105
