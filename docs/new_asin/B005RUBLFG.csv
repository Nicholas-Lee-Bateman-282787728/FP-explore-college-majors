4861146,4,B005RUBLFG,"Thought there would be more to it, as most of it is already on the DREAM WITH ME DVD.  However I'm still glad to have in my collection of JME's CD's and DVD's.",1398470400,,159,3.8181818181818183
4861147,5,B005RUBLFG,"This DVD is amazing, and gives a glimpse into the creative process behind Jackie Evancho's Dream With Me album. It's hard to believe a 10-11 year old has the kind of talent Jackie does, and she's gotten better and will continue to do so!",1397520000,2,237,4.409090909090909
4861148,3,B005RUBLFG,"...and over half of it is already on Dream With Me In Concert!

First I would like to say I enjoy the DVD and overall am glad I bought it; however since this is in NO way a musical performance my review is NOT for Jackie herself ( who always seems to deserve five stars ), but only the DVD.  I don't know, nor does the Amazon listing state, the origin of this documentary.  The real problem is maybe not with it as much as the fact that it's been ""raided"" and 12 minutes of it ""lifted"" for the extra  feature included with the DVD of her Dream With Me in Concert PBS Great Performances music video of the same title.  There HAVE been a few changes, most notably the re-editing which substitutes clips from the PBS special in place of certain ones on this original program, and is always a treat to have additional and mostly candid footage of Jackie.

Due to the insufficient information here in both the product description and the half-dozen ""reviews"" ( which are less reviews of the product than they are paens to Jackie ) I was led to believe this was a documentary about the making of the PBS special rather than just the original album, interesting as that is.  As in its truncated version as an ""extra"" on the DWMIC DVD it's nice to see Jackie collaborating with David Foster and get further insight to her as both a singing prodigy and a ""normal"" ten-year-old.  Most interesting are the scenes of Jackie actually singing in the tiny closet-sized recording booth in Foster's home studio where the album was taped.

Other Jackie fans will no doubt be apoplectic that I've only given this DVD a rating of THREE STARS; though I will assure everyone that is by no means a reflection on Jackie herself but that will probably go for naught and instead be considered a personal attack on her.  My main point here is that this is only a short 19 minute featurette - if like me you want to own every recording by and about Jackie then I suppose you'll also need to buy this one.  But at the secondary-market prices they seem for no apparant reason to command consider this a Caveat Emptor!",1393545600,7,2087,4.422976501305483
4861149,5,B005RUBLFG,"Once in a lifetime does a talent like Jackies come into view.
A listener without knowing her age would find her singing voice wonderful and then to find her to be only 11 years old in this DVD astounded.
She continues to grow as an artist and as a marvalous role model of a girl becoming an enchanting young woman with amazing talent.",1393372800,,334,4.317460317460317
4861150,5,B005RUBLFG,"This video surprises. Behind the amazing voice and stage presence of Jackie Evancho there is a very human, very normal girl. She could be the girl next door. But when she sings, she becomes something extraordinary.
A pleasant and heartwarming paradox.",1392768000,3,251,5.146341463414634

4861153,5,B005RUBLFG,"I have been a fan of Jackie for over a year now and I had no idea how special this DVD was until I purchased it just a couple of months ago.  I hadn't realized how much I had missed with the behind the scenes footage during the making of her Dream With Me CD.  There is some very special video coverage of the recording process at David Foster's home studio in addition to  a lot of candid video of Jackie.

I am very pleased with this purchase and I would highly recommend it for anyone.",1356825600,9,488,4.052083333333333
