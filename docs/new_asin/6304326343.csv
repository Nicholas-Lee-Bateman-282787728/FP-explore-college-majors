7868773,4,6304326343,"One of the only cartoons I watched in the 90's.
Mainly cause I was drunk whenever I watched it.
This will go down in history as the most moronic
cartoon made in the 90's, even though they are funny!!
I rate this Cartoon a 4 of 5 stars!!",1195948800,,236,3.9375
7868774,5,6304326343,"Generation in Crisis(A)-Good, solid opening ep.  Here, the b's are the chosen subjects of a documentary maker's film.  Hilite when Beavis' cussing is blurred out.
Citizen Butthead(A+)-A good classic ep done right!  Here, the b's meet Bill Clinton and become students of the year.  Hilite when the b's call Principal McVicker ""Principal McDicker"".
Sexual Harassment(A+)-Yet another perfect ep.  Here, the b's sue a pretty girl from their class for giving them stiffies during the day.  Hilite when the b's get stiffies from the judge and Butthead says ""Now you're harassing us.""
Stewart is Missing(B+)-Great ep, but purdy disappointing compared to the last 3.  Here, the b's help the Stevensons find their missing son.  Hilite when the b's draw all over Stewart's face on a missing poster.
Prank Call(A+)-The third perfect ep on a tape, which is a record.  Here, the b's prank call a guy named Harry Sachz and Stewart's dad gets the blame.  Hilite when Mr. Stevenson gets his phone shoved where the sun don't shine.
Feel A Cop(A)-Great ep, but doesn't compare to the last.  Here, the b's have an encounter with a female cop undercover as a prostitute.  Hilite when Beavis puts a showercap on his head and goes ""doooiiiinnng!""
Buy Beer(A)-Another A worthy ep.  Here, the b's buy a non-alcoholic beer and hope to get ""fitshaced"".  Hilite when the b's have an encounter with a cop while drinking.
Buttniks(A)-A good episode to close out the tape.  Here, the b's visit a coffeehouse and Cornholio takes the stage.  Hilite when Beavis becomes Cornholio.
All n all, I give this tape an A",1041638400,2,1580,4.90566037735849
