2381625,5,B000AA4F24,My grandson (age 3 1/2 years) just loves these DVDs. He watches America's Funniest Videos every Sunday night.  His favorite ones are those with animals - especially dogs.  He calls them silly puppies.  These DVDs were a big hit with him.,1140912000,,237,4.7317073170731705
2381626,4,B000AA4F24,"America's Funniest Home Videos presents The Best of Kids and Animals, the All Animal Extravaganza and Battle of The Best all in one set. The animals take center stage as a ""deer devil"" bounds across traffic and girls scream as the attack of the miniature lizard is filmed at home. The cats who talk and sing seem to be the highlight of this collection. ""Smitten with a Kitten"" is adorable, but the Swimming Cat is what truly made me almost fall off the couch laughing. Karate Cat is pure laughter therapy and the four giggling babies are adorable. Birds, giraffes and rhinos also get in on the comedy act, but cats and dogs are the real feature of this three-disc set.

It was a huge improvement when Tom Bergeron became the host of the show because he is actually funny!  This video(DVD) is NOT hosted by Tom.  I also notice that now they're listing every host that ever did the show so you don't know who really is in each DVD. Irritating!!!",1382918400,,432,4.443037974683544

2381778,3,B000AA4F24,"The video was inexpensive, and I bought it to get free shipping on a purchase. My kids enjoy the show, but apparently only enjoy it when Tom Bergeron is hosting. They watched it, but found Bob Saget annoying, which is understandable. Still, I'm sure it would be entertaining for younger children, say, age 6 and under.",1364947200,,318,4.696428571428571
2381779,1,B000AA4F24,"I bought this video to run in our Animal Hospital's reception area, the quality is beyond terrible, picture putting in an actual video cassette when you get that grainy picture with the audio sounding not quite right, It's OLD and dated with the old graphics & Bob Saget as the host, it has MANY annoying LAME segements with a 1/2 boy 1/2 horse trying desperatley to make jokes with Bob Saget, then this 1/2 boy 1/2 horse introduces his sister who is 1/2 girl 1/2 horse to Bob. Seriously why in the world would this make it to video?? I really couldn't believe my eyes and ears, I will actually call it painful to watch. My husband and I had this look on our faces as if we were witnessing a terrible accident while viewing this.
If AFV is willing to make an up to date video of animal clips with VERY limited or NO host at all, with great quality and audio I would be over the moon to purchase it for rotation at our hospital.
This current one would probably make our clients sick.... I will be returning this POS ASAP.",1362441600,,1020,4.290155440414508

2381799,1,B000AA4F24,We love the show and have many of the DVDs but this one is NOT a good one. It has way too much talking and not enough videos.

2381828,3,B000AA4F24,AFV is one of our favorite toys each Sunday evening.  So we decided to get this CD for long car rides.  The clips are funny as always but what we all agreed on is that the panel discussion kills the rythm of the show.  It does take them a while to begin to play off each other and Tom does a good job to keep them moving - but that's the point: it should look like so much work!  And it shouldn't again be about winning another set of money - it should be more about the clips.  Had I previewed this CD I don't think I would have bought it.,1230508800,6,540,3.828828828828829
2381829,5,B000AA4F24,"To me, owning this type of DVD is precipitated by having kids who love AFV, and my kids love this one. A straight-foreward collection of good clips - An ""AFV fix"" for your kids whenever they want one! It's worth the price (I believe I got three DVDS in the pack - all good and a real bargain).",1229472000,,293,4.068965517241379
2381830,3,B000AA4F24,"While I enjoyed the DVD, there were a couple of scenes that were not suitable for young kids--one with a fat guy running across a football field with nothing on but his underpants, and another scene where a woman was trying to pop a balloon between her stomach and a man's rear end (looked vulgar for young eyes).",1226793600,10,313,4.413793103448276
2381831,3,B000AA4F24,My husband very much enjoys America's Funniest Home Videos and always has.  He enjoyed this one too - I could tell by all the laughter I could hear coming all the way from upstairs.,1218412800,,181,4.323529411764706
2381832,2,B000AA4F24,"My kids, 3 and 5, enjoy a lot of the silly clips that they see on AFV and I purchased this set for them. Surprising to me, they have not shown great interest in these dvds. I think one of the issues is that the dvds include MUCH of the dialogue by the hosts, including the AFV theme music as they go to AND come back from commercial breaks. The music and dialogue combined contribute to the majority of time in these videos. In short, if you were to actually calculate the amount of time devoted to clips, it really doesn't amount to a whole lot more than you would catch in a typical episode on TV. I guess I/we expected to see a greater compilation of clips given the longevity of the show.",1203984000,19,692,4.1716417910447765
2381833,2,B000AA4F24,"Some of the video clips are funny but the rest was like a train wreck.  The video set-ups by Bob Sagat and his two ""actors"" seemed ad-libbed and forced.  It was to the point of agony to get to the next group of videos.  I don't see my wife and I ever watching it again.  I only hope the other one I bought her is better.  Of course we were so scarred from this one, we haven't watched it yet.",1199232000,5,392,3.85
2381834,5,B000AA4F24,"I bought this as a family gift for our family which includes a 7 yr. son and 10 yr. daughter.  To get three dvd's in regular size dvd cases is nice, compared to the flimsy clear cases you usually get in a collection pack.  I consider it a great investment (I paid just $15.99)as it's one of those dvd's you just pull it out when you feel like having a great laugh together.  Now, I will say, the AFV Looks at Kids & Animals with Bob Saget was not very funny.  We hardly laughed in this one, including my kids. Bob had some really corny fillers in between the videos and I mean corny - SentarBoy? - Half boy, half animal?  I would have been very disappointed if I had just bought this video as even the clips aren't all that funny.  The other two in my opinion make it up.  The Battle of the Best has some funny dialogs between the celebrities (beware of the phrase using ""hell"" that is used by one if this is offensive to you.  This has some screamingly funny clips.  The clips are longer too which I like.  The All Animal Extravaganza is very funny too - several clips you may have already seen on youtube.  This has  Tom Bergeron as a host and he makes everything funny in my opinion anyway.  Whether you have kids or not, if you like AFV, this will be great to add to your collection.",1198713600,9,1287,4.161943319838056
