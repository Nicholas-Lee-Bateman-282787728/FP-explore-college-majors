8380218,5,B002TLRG78,"Like others before and after him, Che does not come without controversy. This documentary describes in great detail how the most famous photograph of the 20th century made its way around the globe and intricate details behind the original publisher and owner.",1377475200,,259,5.190476190476191
8380219,5,B002TLRG78,an in-depth history of perhaps the most iconic image of our time.  the filmmakers really did their homework and didn't stop at making a 'good' film - they went on to tell a great story in a great way.,1357689600,,200,4.128205128205129
8380220,5,B002TLRG78,"Chevolution is an exploration into the uses of the image of Dr. Ernesto Guevara de la Serna raising questions about the photo as well as the photographer, Alberto Korda, who caught Che in the perfect moment of defiance. It is persuasive in telling the story of the image from its highly charged origin at the funeral march following the terrorist attack on El Cubre against the young revolutionary Cuba to its least enduring use as a fashion statement. That said, it can initiate a discussion as to who was Guevara and why has his image continued to inspire struggles for social justice long after his death. His image was present during the recent Arab Spring leading one to suggest that the quest for equality, like the ideology of Che, may be eternal.",1351900800,4,754,4.71969696969697
8380221,5,B002TLRG78,"I think of someone a knew in his job at a high-tech company where he would go to work at home, joke about spending a few million dollars on acquiring a company, all with Che, who he thought was cool, on his chest. Once, someone called him a capitalist and he was so insulted. Yet he travels, has a 2500 square foot home, a hot tub, buys jeans that cost $200 a pop and even has his hair foiled once a month for over a hundred without a tip. Dinner out, new skis, maybe a trip to Hawaii with his girlfriend are purchased without thought. And yet he wears Che, his hero, on his chest. He also considers himself a pacifist. Does not believe in violence. Works with the government, is a democrat. I always thought it strange. Being that we both studied international history in university I wondered, had he missed school the day they read chapter on Cuba?

The Che image is mesmerizing. He is amazingly sexy. But he was also a close comrade of Castro. A medical doctor, when he returned to Cuba he took up arms instead of medicine and murdered many. He said revolution cannot take place without love, but also believed guns and fighting and murder a part of it. The fact that the photographer who took the photo did not receive credit due to communist laws is insane. The image has become one of anyone who just thinks they are on the fringe. But whose fringe are you on? You can't work at Apple and think you are on the fringe. You can't save your stock options and fight for equality through socialism and anti-capitolism and wear a Che shirt unless you have some kind of large weapon under your desk and are planning to take over the government.

There doesn't seem to be a perfect form of government. There is always a rich and always a poor and always a huge divide between. Che's motives were seemingly good; to equalize this divide. But they were done by overthrowing a government with much loss of life and not much improvement. Violence, to me, is unforgivable. I am a pacifist, and have never worn or decorated with sexy Che because it is clear that the image has been taken about as far out of context as it could and to loosely quote a comrade of Che's in the movie, Che himself would either be sarcastically entertained or horrified if he were alive. Hippies, pacifists, angry youth and trustafarians were definitely not his target audience. And yet they eat him up with a silver fork, which he would probably use to murder their parents and their parents friends in an attempt to begin a take over of the country to equalize the rich and the poor. Or to probe them into joining his guerrilla movement, like old Patty Hurst in her Army Days.

I think it is the look in his eyes, which we read as, well, sexy and masculine (but turns out to be one of grief, horror, anger, and determination), his hair, the star. It was just a good moment for him. In the image he could be a lead singer of a band, a famous actor, but our people seem to have forgetten that he was a guerrilla revolutionary with strong beliefs that capitalism, which my friend enjoys deeply, and those who practice it, should be shot for not giving equal rights and equal resources to all people. If Fidel had a beautiful shot like that, would we worship him?

I guess this makes the person I know with the Che shirt is an idiot, in truth. You don't put  your kids to bed in a Che shirt. You don't spend money at Sharper Image in a Che shirt. You don't put hearts and flowers around Che. He might have been a great man to some, and his ideals were understandable, but his methods were madness, and for that he died. Ask a Cuban National before you wear Che. Watch the movie and see that this image was, made by a fashion photographer, who cropped it out of context and found it used, due to communist laws, without his permission. Didn't, until recent law suits, make a penny without it.

Somehow I think my friend pictures Che in a mansion somewhere in South America, and old man drinking daiquiris with his beautiful young wife and smoking cigars and living the good life of an ex-revolutionary. Yes. It's that ridiculous.

Makes me angry enough to want to ask anyone I see wearing this image if they know the story behind what this man represented. I would guess that, in nearly 99.9% of cases, people think they are just wearing the face of a hero, like an astronaut or a rock star. Maybe a rebel without a cause, like James Dean or Curt Cobain.

It is simply more proof that Ignorance should be Painful. It should actually make your head hurt. Intelligence should make you high. And that saying, BTW, is mine. Copyright, 2009.",1350604800,3,4605,4.409411764705882
8380222,1,B002TLRG78,"This Marxist, murdering thug was responsible for anywhere between 400 and 2500 deaths via firing squads during the Cuban revolution. This film tries to make Guevara out to be this angelic savior of the downtrodden by overthrowing a corrupt administration and installing a nirvana in Cuba where everyone has everything they need. This couldn't be further from the truth. In fact, everything this pig attempted he failed. Look at the Garden of Eden he left behind in Cuba.

The people in this film are at best delusional in their assessment of Guevara. In an attempt to re-write history they even go so far as to compare the corpse of Guevara to Christ! I almost choked. But everyone agrees that the image of Guevara was to be shared by all as a symbol of cooperation that spits in the eye of capitalism. That is until Guevara and Korda died. Then Korda's heiress and daughter decided to err on the side of capitalism and copyright the image. Ironic, isn't it? This whole film is a left wing, Marxist puff piece by those in desperate need of a hero where none exists. I suggest if you watch this to follow up by doing your own research to see who Guevara really was in life.",1324252800,17,1172,4.5545023696682465
