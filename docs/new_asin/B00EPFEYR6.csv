8607925,3,B00EPFEYR6,boring after awhile didn't keep interest,1522368000,,40,5.833333333333333
8607926,1,B00EPFEYR6,Very slow narration; the thin storyline is stretched boringly over the whole episode.  Annoying repetitive images making everything like meat and flies and anything and everything look grisly with endless repetition.  Sneering and sarcastic with everything masonic red/white/black colors.  Boring storyline combines with gross imagery to makes this tedious to watch.,1516060800,,366,6.137254901960785

8607929,5,B00EPFEYR6,This is one of the best true crime series with enactments I've ever seen. I can't wait for another season. The narration and sets are the best ever.,1468886400,,148,4.321428571428571
