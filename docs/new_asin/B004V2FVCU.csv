8442741,4,B004V2FVCU,"Aakhir Kyon? is a beautiful film that details the stigma of a divorce for an Indian woman, her struggles and humiliations, and the strength and courage required to fight and conquer. Made in the 1980s, it did a great job of staging the question, Until when must women continue to be used, abused, victimized, oppressed, and denied the right to their own unique personality? An inspirational film, the movie shows how Smita Patil's character, simply on the basis of her own merits and fortitude, is able to start life again from scratch, begin a career, achieve success and respect, and above all, create her own identity all through her diligence and hard work. Songs have wonderful lyrics. Smita Patil is amazing as is Tina Munim. Rajesh Khanna is also great.",1304812800,,760,4.8538461538461535
