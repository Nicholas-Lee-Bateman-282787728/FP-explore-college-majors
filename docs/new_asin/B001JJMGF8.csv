8313005,4,B001JJMGF8,"For those who do not know him, El Chavo(the kid) is a mexican sitcom born around 1970 from the mind of Roberto Gomez Bolanos. Is the highest rating latin american show in history and has been translated to over a dozen of languages. Just ask anyone from latin america and they will tell you about their memories of this truly unique show. In many countries the show has been in reruns for 20,25,30 years or more. and in many of those countries many catch phrases from the characthers had become part of everyday language. The animated series is basically the tv series scripts in animated form, same jokes, same situations. That's the only reason I do not give it 5 stars. Still, the series is really fun, a lot of the concepts of the original show are expanded and some things not possible with human actors for obvious reasons happen here, like when el chavo dreams himself as a knight, a jet fighter pilot and astronaut or a pirate. It's done for kids but everyone can enjoy this series.",1252195200,4,990,4.5363128491620115
