8156926,5,B000KHX6ZY,This is great DVD for the kids and it arrived on time in great shape at a good price. Would do business with this seller again.,1254614400,,127,3.923076923076923
8156927,3,B000KHX6ZY,"One of the few shows that my 20 month old will sit and watch for 10 minutes withough making a peep.  He loves the Loonette and Molly parts, but hates the dust bunnies and the reading part.  Sings and dances along with the music.  One thing that needs to be mentioned is that although this is listed as the original Loonette(Alison Court) it is not it's Ramona Gilmore Darling, who is not nearly as good as Court.",1247529600,4,412,4.324675324675325
8156928,5,B000KHX6ZY,"My son, Truett, never watched shows until this! One day I turned on PBS and there it was, ""Big Comfy Couch"". It caught his eye and he watched almost the entire thing. He was about 16-17 months old and never watched anything for more than a minute. I couldn't believe something would keep his attention. I think cartoons are way too stimulating and fast for him but this was almost like a play or skit(it actually is). I got online and found this one. He loves this one the best, we have 2 more ""Big Comfy Couch"" videos and this is by far the best. Truett is now 22 months and although he watches maybe once a week he loves the characters and we often talk about them. Also, when he is sick we may have a ""MOLLY"" marathon. He calls Loonette and Molly, Molly.",1227312000,,757,4.227586206896552
8156929,5,B000KHX6ZY,"This is one clown and dolly we can't live without.  When the new season ends we pop in the old dvd's and remind ourselves of the old lessons learned.  My daughter now does her own 10 second tidy, a miracle!",1223251200,,206,4.125
8156930,3,B000KHX6ZY,"Bought this for my 15 month old who loves the show.  Amazon said this had Alyson Court in it (the original loonette!) but she's not in this one!!  It is the second girl, and for whatever reason it makes a difference!  My daughter still watches it.",1221955200,,247,4.326086956521739
8156931,5,B000KHX6ZY,My three year old loves to party.  And this dvd is just that.  She's already planning her 4th birthday and she's only 3 and 3 months!  Too cute for words and as always not disappointing.  Gotta love the Big Comfy Couch!,1212624000,,219,4.2682926829268295
8156932,5,B000KHX6ZY,My almost 2 year old daughter loves this show so much. Having the tapes left over from big sis my husband put one in and she became a huge fan. Having the show with the original Loonette is hard to find on dvd so we bought this one to see if she would like it thought my now 6 year old can tell the difference my 2 year old still think it's great. She can sit through all 3 episodes on the dvd with no problem. I am even finding my 6 year old watching with her saying mom she grows on you. If you are looking for something different then colored talking amimals give it a try.,1187308800,3,576,3.889830508474576
