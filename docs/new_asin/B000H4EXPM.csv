8136260,5,B000H4EXPM,"Petrilli addresses some of the major ways close quarter stick fighters engage by adopting a single reference point within a stick fight; the time both fighters meet with forward energy. This is very different than a Dog Brother video.  Mark Denny, for example, really likes to rely on stick energy to clear the way for striking.  Like Petrilli, Knaus, Richardson, etc, Denny knows it all, but he is a real believer in using the stick strike versus the stick compression.  That stuff is awesome but you will not find much of it here on Petrilli's DVDs, (its been done). This type of video comes into play when you have done what Denny suggests and your opponent crashes into you in order to save himself from a stick thrashing.  This is where Petrilli earned his stripes as a fighter. (He is 5'3"" so he did not become famous as a long range fighter.) Like all small fighters, Petrilli zones away from his opponent's big guns and isolates a limb or the head / head & arm. He takes the opponent down and ends the match with a compression or lock while retaining a hand or knee to follow up and ensure a surrender or finish.

Petrilli is also a refined martial artist.  If you like to go throw for throw in a pure martial arts workout, this is unbeatable.  Sure, it hurts to practice compression throws, so if you are not down with a bit of pain, you will rather throw than be thrown. If you are a trained fighter, especially a wrestler, a JKD guy, BJJ, or straight MMA, you will see a lot of stuff you know buried in these techniques.  Petrilli stood alongside guys like Brandon Lee and Burton Richardson as he trained with Dan Inosanto, so he has done his share of boxing, muay thai, silat, etc.. You will see it blended in.  He was a great Detroit area wrestler before entering the military, so look for wrestling moves. He made it to the top of the Army's elite units so expect that this stuff will be effective and brutal - and be careful.

If this does not look real to you, try it.  The trick is that Petrilli can stay away from his opponent by using the stick as a lever to compensate for what you may think is a lack of structure.  If you are good, this will make you better. If you are small, this is essential. Let's face it, we are ALL smaller than some of the guys we fight.

Two final points.  First, Petrilli uses Sherril Johnson as a fall girl.  Don't let it fool you.  I watched Petrilli take out an NCAA Division 1 All American with several techniques used on this video.  The guy was real good and outweighed Petrilli by 40 lbs; Petrilli broke the guy like a toy.  Second - the DVD has some great video angles from the Paladin Guys. Five stars!",1367971200,3,2659,4.3373737373737375
8136261,2,B000H4EXPM,"When it teaches, This DVD is what a training video should be like: Very clear, no fluff, and no long useless info.
The trouble with this DVD, is that is starts from a faulty premise. Nothing in here is practical, unless you are in a competition with another stick fighter. If you were to hand a stick to someone on the street, your attacker would never attack like this. What untrained attacker uses a checking Hand in a circular motion? There are about 15 very effective moves starting from the same position.
The position is: if your attacker uses their left hand to grab your left shoulder with their palm facing away from you, and you grab the back of that hand with your left hand using a circular motion.
All the moves assume they are doing the same motion, and you are able to grab their hand in the air. That is the starting position for every move. [Look at the box cover to see the grip].
They don't go over any other possible attacks, nor do they show any variations on how to get your attacker into the starting grip. They could have just as easily said, ""When someone throws a punch at you, grab the first finger on their other hand, and now here are 15 things you can do with that finger."" That is about how useful this is.
It's very detailed and clear, but ultimately, useless for self defense.",1257465600,2,1309,4.368852459016393
8136262,5,B000H4EXPM,"Crashing the Lines is an excellent introduction to Doce Pares Eskrima by  Christopher Petrilli (8th degree black belt)and his demonstration partner a 6th degree black belt.  Together they demonstrate the effectiveness of Doce Pares with and without weapons.  Starting with the basic striking patterns and compression arm movements in vol. 1, to the snake set and painful arm bar series in vol. 2 to the over and under arm series and empty hand applications of vol. 3.
Practice these techniques carefully or you will run out of training partners.  Use these techniques and you may run out of enemies, not that I am suggesting you do that.  Mr. Petrilli's instructions are concise and to the point as well as his skill and execution.  This is an excellent training series and I would suggest to anyone to get the complete series.",1222560000,4,827,4.871428571428571
