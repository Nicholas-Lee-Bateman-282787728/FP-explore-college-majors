1352855,2,B00004TX0M,"Irritatingly fluffy, and classically indicative of  Brit camp, this one will make you want to fast forward to the next decent scene (not rewind as some of these other reviewers said.  The eye candy in the men's support group scenes (and the notably brilliant performances by the guru and his wife -- an exception in this flick)can't sustain the whole movie.  What really turned me off from irritation to outrage is the  nasty ending in which the main character has sex with his high school sweetheart, a woman.  Granted there was no indication that this encounter meant much of anything, but it truly offended me that a movie all about coming to terms with the funny poignancies of mature monogomy in GLB relationships could end by sending the message that all the confused and silly would-be monogamous gay man needs is a good roll in the hay with a pretty blonde waitress.  Don't even bother renting it.",977616000,20,905,4.732484076433121
1352856,5,B00004TX0M,"I had no idea what to expect, and was very pleasantly surprised when I found an intelligent, witty film about real sexuality, not the polarized you're-either-gay-or-straight stuff that everyone else seems to specialize in.  The characters aren't perfect; they're stumbling around in the dark just like the rest of us, but they do it with the sort of grace I wish we were all capable of.  Simply a film to warm your heart, no matter where you are on the scale.  See it. I mean it.",974937600,18,479,4.546511627906977
1352857,5,B00004TX0M,"This is a jewel! An upbeat British-cast comedy, created by American filmmaker Troche, which realizes sexuality isn't a black-and-white, 'gay or straight' issue, but rather all about the chemistry between specific people, often humorous, and always complex.",972864000,7,256,5.945945945945946
1352858,3,B00004TX0M,"Charming little film about a gay man and the crazy world that surrounds him, the film is delightful but doesn't stand too far above the many charming and delightful gay-themed British films that we've seen in the  last little while (Get Real, Like It Is), but is probably most notable for  being the one that really makes a concerted effort to stretch people's  guidelines of what constitutes sexual orientation: the main character finds  himself attracted to a straight man in his all-male therapy group, and the  straight man actually goes out with him and ends becoming quite enamored in  their relationship.  The latter guy's girlfriend turns out to be our hero's  ex-girlfriend from college, and they in turn find a possible reignition of  their young puppy love.  While not anything worth writing home about, the  film is bright and lively and features a great Jane Austen-themed sadism  dream sequence, complete with one of the film's stars Harriet Walker, who  you might remember as the evil Fanny in Sense and Sensibility.  Her scenes  with Simon Callow are among the film's best (""I love being a  woman,"" she says, ""Not because of you but because of me."")",963100800,19,1165,4.897435897435898
1352859,5,B00004TX0M,"A gay man falls in love.  You might expect to find the average hollywood sterotypes and embarassed humor, but instead there is a fresh approach and one which does not rely on defined roles.  The characters are witty and you  feel their emotions, but they are not predictable.  I couldn't stop  laughing.",962582400,7,303,4.75
1352870,4,B00004TX0M,A well crafted  and well acted film that focuses on the trials and loves of a delightful cast set in London. The leads are simply adorable young Brits exploring their lives as they twist in and out of daily life. Well worth seeing!,1406419200,,231,4.372093023255814
1352871,5,B00004TX0M,"It is often the case that one has to look outside of the United States for films that deal with gay characters in interesting ways.  Bedrooms & Hallways did it for me.  It's not a deep or complex film.  It's pretty lighthearted stuff, involving how the characters - gay and straight - try to connect with one another on both physical and non-physical ways, and how they try to deal honestly with their expectations in their relationships.  There are a lot of funny moments, and some touching ones too.  Best of all, not everything is tied up neatly in the end, which I liked.",1398038400,,575,4.490384615384615
1352872,5,B00004TX0M,"Great comedy from Great Britain.  Two gay room mates in London, each seeking Mr. Right, forms

And and and. Among so many bad movies I have recently seen, I don't regret spending almost two hours in front of tv.
In some circles it got kind of cult status and I am really not surprised.
Two thumbs up!",1308009600,,356,4.25
1352876,3,B00004TX0M,"Film was an interesting take on the boy meets boy genre.  However, the plot developement was a little lacking and some of the situations were a bit contrived.  Interesting in seeing the actors who have been in so many other british films, especially romantic melodramas, doing modern day roles.",1282521600,,294,4.979591836734694
1352877,5,B00004TX0M,"I'm not sure how this charming little comedy escaped me for so long but I'm certainly glad I finally saw it. This 1998 film is directed by Rose Troche (""Go Fish"") and stars Kevin McKidd as Leo (Lucius Vorenus in the HBO series ""Rome""), James Purefoy as Brendan (Mark Antony in the same series), Simon Callow as Keith, whom I remembered from ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", Hugo Weaving as Jeremy (""The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert""), Tom Hollander as Darren (""Gosford Park"") and Jennifer Ehle as Sarah (""Pride and Prejudice"").

The plot is a hoot. Leo, who plays a young gay man having difficulty with relationships joins one of these men's groups made famous in the U. S. by the likes of the poet Robert Bly where its members get in touch with their manhood by camping out, beating on drums, handling ""honesty"" stones, et cetera. When Leo confesses that he has feelings for Brendan, who is supposedly straight, you know you are in for a hilarious ride or drumming, in this case.

One of my favorite scenes among many occurs when Leo is recommended a book that will take his mind off of sex. He has already read the first recommendation, an autobiography of Margaret Thatcher so he settles for the second suggestion PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. He then has a highly erotic dream where he is a servant who enjoys being whipped by Mr. Darcy. Just as funny is the episode when Leo's roommate Darren lets Jeremy blindfold him and tie him up spread-eagled on the bed and then proceeds to cut off his ""Calvins.""

Writing comedy is always a dicey undertaking since what amuses one viewer may not affect another. This little film, however, reminds us just how good British comedy can be-- if that is what this film is since the director is I believe Puerto Rican-- and is one not to be missed.",1220140800,,1792,4.59375
1352878,4,B00004TX0M,"Fans of HBO's ""Rome"" and lovers of Brit cinema will enjoy this delightful film about the quest for love, the power of lust, and meaning of friendship. Kevin McKidd, all earnest, soul-searching blue eyes and wistful charm, is Leo, a gay man looking for a relationship. His roommate Darren (Tom Hollander) is obsessed with his new lover, a sex-crazed real estate agent named Jeremy, played by Hugo Weaving. Encouraged by a straight friend to participate in his small, new-age men's group, Leo meets Brendan (James Purefoy), a handsome Irishman recently separated from his girlfriend. Under the auspices of the group leader, hilariously portrayed by Simon Callow, the men--all of them, with the exception of Leo, claiming to be straight--explore their ""maleness"" and attempt to bond by sharing their feelings and their secrets. While Darren and Jeremy indulge in riotous sex in the assortment of houses to which Jeremy has keys, Leo finds that he is falling in love with Brendan...whose ex-girlfriend Sally (Jennifer Ehle) turns out to be Leo's own long-ago sweetheart.

If this sounds a little bit complicated, it isn't, and the sequence of events is never difficult to figure out. The storyline is charming and entertaining, if a bit predictable, and the acting is excellent. McKidd and Purefoy, who recently starred in HBO's series ""Rome"" (Purefoy as Mark Antony, McKidd as the Roman soldier Lucius Vorenus), generate a real chemistry in their love scenes together, in addition to being genuine eye candy, and all supporting actors (especially Weaving, with his curled lip and lewdly penetrating stare) do an very fine job. The film is funny and engaging, bawdy but never really vulgar, and a pleasure to watch from start to finish.",1186963200,,1732,5.120141342756184
1352879,3,B00004TX0M,"SPOILER: DON'T READ IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW THE ENDING: First of all, I have to say that if you are a fan of HBO's Rome, be prepared to see Lucius Vorenus (Kevin McKidd) and Marc Antony (James Purefoy) making out. I kept yelling at the TV ""Noooo!"" until my husband told me to stop being silly. I was being silly, but I think I was just jealous of Kevin McKidd (I'm a big fan of James Purefoy). Now that I have that out of the way, I have to say that we enjoyed most of this movie. It's a fun sort of romp and there are some moments that will make you laugh out loud. However, the ending bothered us. We live in San Francisco and have many gay friends, and they were disturbed by the ending too. It seems to suggest that being gay is a choice, as the gay man ""Leo"" suddenly decides he isn't gay after all. Umm, okay. Maybe he's bisexual? I don't know, it was just an odd ending. Great performances though, with other roles being played by the head elf from LOTR (Hugo Weaving) and Lizzie from Pride & Prejudice (Jennifer Ehle).",1186444800,,1028,4.145
1352890,4,B00004TX0M,"This hilarious film features, among it's other outrageous and ridiculous gags, a men's group that's trying to connect with their inner maleness and who does hunting-and-gathering as bonding and spiritual enlightenment.  So if you're in the mood for something sedate, this isn't it.

However, if you're in the mood for pure fun and a commentary on sexual politics, then this will more than satisfy.  It has kept me thinking and interested long after the credits rolled.

I wondered, as I watched this film, whether it was really that outrageous to propose that sexual identities might be more fluid than we generally thought.  The characters in this film seem to switch teams, but much of the movie is presented in dream-like sequences and it's not altogether clear whether they were fantasies or ""reality.""

In any event, it's a well-edited, well-acted, clever, compelling film that is full of surprises and colorful characters that manage to establish their dignity just as they appear to lose it.

Cute, clever, and thoughtful.  Worth a watch.  Recommended.",1121385600,2,1059,5.146198830409356

A great pleasure: very nice story, good study of human behaviours, very well played by many talented actors and actress, never coarse and first and foremost it makes us learn being more tolerant and  open minded towards other people.

1352892,4,B00004TX0M,"Bedrooms and Hallways is an enjoyable and at times witty film that follows the lead ( Leo ) on his quest to find romance, love or a husband of sorts. It has the feel of a sit-com with undertones that hit on issues most of us can understand. It's more like light entertainment with a few fairly heavy moments. The production quality is good and the acting was right on. As a note, the actor that plays a kinky real estate salesman is the same actor that plays Mr. Smith in the Matrix movies and it was fun to see him in the truely twisted roll as a Gay sex monger with strange kinks. He hates cheep house wares. Maybe you have to see it to understand. The movie was good and worth picking up and adding to your collection. Its suggestive but tastefully done and would be OK for mixed crowds.",1082073600,3,790,4.203947368421052
1352893,5,B00004TX0M,"I first saw this film at a gay and lesbian film festival. I and my date laughed so hard, that she wet herself, and I choked on my soda. The characters are remarkably 3-dimensional, a thing which is so very hard to achieve in a farce. Their explorations into their own self-concepts, and views of gender, sexuality, and nationality, are both hysterical and poignant. This is a movie that can be enjoyed by everyone. The characters are gay, straight, and in-between; married and single; insightful and downright insane! From "" S&M o-grams "", to ""primitive man weekends,"" and back round again to mutual adultery and real estate agent sex addicts who use other people's houses for their trysts, this film has it all. It's intelligent but not overly intellectual, sexy but tastefull, and has a plot twist that leaves both the gay and straight audiences feeling that they've seen something unique. 5 stars!",1047686400,4,900,4.888888888888889
1352894,4,B00004TX0M,"It is not often that a romance comes along that I actually enjoy.
This film is exceptionally witty and fun.  Tom Hollander and Hugo Weaving both manage to make their 'bigger than life' characters into something real.  ""Romance"" might be a bit of an assumptive label for the film.  It is also about coming of age; making important decisions that will stay with you the rest of your life. The homosexual environment the characters are a part of is casual and real, which makes for a non-insulting view of gay lifestyle.",1039132800,2,517,4.65934065934066
1352895,3,B00004TX0M,"Bedrooms and Hallways is not a unique ""gay"" film.  It actually delves into fairly well covered territory:  gay guy falls for straight guy who gives in only to discover he really is ""straight"".  Doesn't sound too familiar?  No?  Watch this quite well done film and you will find that it is a bit typical of the genre, but it does it quite well and thus rises above the rest.
Comical bits abound and are handled deftly as are the serious ones.  You can't help hoping that the cute couple survives in the end, but you know they cannot.
If I seem to be a bit ambiguous about this film, it's only because the film does so itself more often than I'd like to see.  However, the acting is superb and the direction spot on.  If anything it's the meat of the story that I'm not nuts about.
Check the film out and I think you'll enjoy this tried but true formula presented in a ""unique"" fashion.",1024272000,3,884,4.283132530120482
1352896,5,B00004TX0M,"This is a great film!  I highly recommend it.  It is not fluffy and the script, despite what others have said, is not poorly written.  Rose Troche does not save the film because it did not need to be saved.  Kevin McKidd, Jennifer Ehle, and James Purefoy were each cast perfectly.  Watch out for killer performances from Tom Hollander (from ""Martha Meet Frank Daniel and Laurence"") and Hugo Weaving (from ""Proof"" and ""The Matrix"").  All the performances in this film are great!  Have fun.",987724800,6,488,4.738095238095238
1352897,3,B00004TX0M,"Rose Troche is a talented director.  She has great affection for her actors and protects them from some of the ridiculous material in this screenplay.  The premise is promising as a gay man joins a (straight) men's group and stirs up all sorts of emotions when he admits to being attracted to one of the other members.  There are many fine scenes and the cast is first rate throughout but some of the final twists of the film are unbelievable.  Rose Troche guides everyone through with a steady hand but unfortunately shoots the ending in an unironic context.  It feels as if everyone has partnered off correctly and yet, given the history of the characters, most of the partners seem unfortunate and doomed rather than headed for a happily ever after (as the film implies).
I think the best performance in the  film (a triumph of a performance) is given by Jennifer Ehle who begins the film overly tight and controlled  and then the angles of her face soften into radiant half smiles as she becomes more romantically attached.
The film is worthwhile but definitely confused.  Rose Troche is a directing talent to be reckoned with though and I look forward to what she can do with stronger material.
The DVD is in full frame and the sound is clear but not exceptional.  It does include an interview with the director and the theatrical trailer.",987033600,5,1344,4.685106382978724
1352898,5,B00004TX0M,"I absolutely adore this movie because it is so funny.  This movie is basically about sexual experimentation--a couple of the heterosexual men decide that they want to explore the gay lifestyle, and one of the homosexual guys decides to explore the heterosexual lifestyle.  There is also this men's group where they get in touch with their ""manliness"" and these meetings are absolutely hilarious.  There is this one guy in the group who is a homophobe and it is really funny to watch him squirm while the guys talk about their homosexual longings and experiences.  The group leader is absolutely hilarious and his wife, who has a women's group, is just as funny as he is.  The main character is Leo, and his roommate, Darren, has this boyfriend-Jeremy, who sells houses and takes advantage of him every chance he can in the houses--he is supposed to be selling--while the homeowners are away.  There is one really funny scene where Jeremy handcuffs Darren to a woman's bed and then leaves him there when she comes home unexpectedly.  This movie really is a non-stop laugh experience-everything is so funny.",985910400,11,1105,4.908602150537634
1352899,4,B00004TX0M,"BEDROOMS AND HALLWAYS has the zippy, bracing pace of the best farces, and the actors playing a cross section of gay, straight, and bisexual characters do wonderfully well. The movie had me in the palm of its hand until three-quarters of the way through when the Kinsey-6 leading man Leo starts becoming interested in his former high school sweetheart, a female. From there to the end of the film, the screenplay goes awry in a stumbling, bumbling, totally dunderheaded way that rings false alarms all over the screen. I left the film, despite the off-handed comment from the former gay's female roommate that ""maybe it's just a phase,"" with a sneer and a grimace. Farce is one thing, but that's plain fantasy.
The DVD is presented in disappointing full-frame, and while nothing appears to get chopped off the sides (the movie was probably filmed in a 1.66:1 aspect ratio), I would have preferred a letterbox presentation. The sound is likewise undernourished, a 2.0 Dolby surround track.
Still, despite an ending I found most unsatisfactory, I can't deny that the film had lots of wonderful touches, an engaging cast, and lots of freshness that I did appreciate. Hence the high but less than perfect rating.",984787200,11,1207,4.921568627450981
