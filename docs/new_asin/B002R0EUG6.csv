I can still do it, but I feel a little weird about it. The people involved did a great job, with lots of love and good information in this movie. I think a few parts could have been shortened and it would not cause a huge problem for the film.
Anyway, this film is a documentary about house rabbits. I think it is the first and only film exclusively about house rabbits. The information is solid about what is needed to properly take care of your house rabbit. They do show someone who breeds rabbits for food and it's not pleasant, but you won't have nightmares about it. I am not fond of the films that try to shock me into caring about an issue.

I would advise anyone who is thinking about the possibility of a house rabbit to buy and watch this movie. Bunnies just don't sit in their cages all day, they are social and like to be around others. They can live 10 years or better and yes, they will need a vet's care at sometime or another. All of them have their own personalities. I would also advise anybody looking for a house rabbit to look in animal shelters to find one. Rabbits are the third most popular pet, but they are also the third most surrendered animal. Make sure you pick an animal that is right for you.

Okay, I'll get down from my soapbox now.",1305417600,,1438,4.225454545454546
