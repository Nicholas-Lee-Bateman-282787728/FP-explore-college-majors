The box consists of 3 DVDs with 2 episodes on each one (about 40 minutes per episode).  The dubbing is very monotone, but at times, it can be quite funny.

For the $17 I paid for this set, I felt that I got my money's worth.  Starring Alexander Lou (from ""Ninja: the Final Duel""), and featuring at least 2 Venom actors, it's a very decent show.

There are a few problems, however, that might turn off some viewers.  For example, the main hero tends to rape girls when he's disturbed at sleep, and some of the things he says is pretty adultish.

The story gets bogged down a little bit with extreme melodrama, and the training sequences are nothing to write home about.

The main thing this movie has going for it are ninjas.  But the problem here is that the ninjas don't do anything special except lose really fast.  And they're not even the focus of this video.

I'd only get this if you're collecting Joseph Kuo movies - yes, this is the same guy who made such classics as ""Born Invincible"" and ""Ninja Checkmate.""  But don't expect ""Venom of the Ninja"" to be anything like those!",1120780800,,1174,4.434579439252336
