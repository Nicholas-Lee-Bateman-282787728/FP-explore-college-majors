6735718,5,B00OGL6S64,"One of the best historical dramas out there, maybe even better than The Tudor's run! If only it was longer!! I really hope they continue with a new mini-series!!!",1380931200,2,162,4.620689655172414
6735719,5,B00OGL6S64,It's worth the money. If you have on demand it's free. It is a great series. I recommend watching it,1380672000,4,100,4.05
6735720,4,B00OGL6S64,"Say what you will, it is a good depiction of the War of the Roses, and, most importantly, it is historically accurate, as opposed to ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" and the first installment of ""The Tudors"". Also, as opposed to the just mentioned movies, the casting is excellent. Elizabeth Woodville is beautiful, King Edward IV is tall, Richard III is short with dark hair, the Duke of Clarence is good looking and greedy, etc., and David Oakes does a fantastic job playing the latter character. The one miscast person so far, in my opinion, is the young Prince of Wales who gets killed at Tewkesbury.
The witchcraft thing is definitely overdone, even more so than in the first 3 books of the series. According to history, Jaqcuetta Woodville was accused of witchcraft twice, and had to defend herself against the accusations. She must have done so ably, as she was never convicted and died of an unspecified disease when she was in her late 50's.
I wished there had been more outdoor shots, as in The Tudors, which had beautiful outdoor scenery and lighting. Here, it seems various people ride through the same woods constantly, or towards the same castle. But that is the only beef I have. If you like the War of the Roses, you will enjoy this series. I do and I will buy it once it becomes available for purchase.",1379462400,7,1310,4.602564102564102
6735721,5,B00OGL6S64,"I am addicted! After I viewed the first episode, I read everything I could find on the internet about Edward IV and Elizabeth.  I also ordered all three of Philippa Gregory's books in the series.  I have never been a history buff but the story of the War of the Roses is amazing!",1379289600,2,279,4.245283018867925
6735722,5,B00OGL6S64,"Being an novice student of British history, I am always eager when any new show comes out relating to this topic.  While this is historical fiction it does follow history quite accurately.  The casting is phenomenal!  I will address some of the characters that really stood out for me.  I am NO authority these are just my opinions! :-)

Rebecca Ferguson portrays a brave and beautiful Queen Elizabeth.  Her performance is commanding and powerful.  She really portrays the strength and courage of her character during a very dangerous time in British history.

Amanda Hale presents viewers with a pious and scheming Lady Beaufort.  She does an excellent job of conveying her love for God and her son while showing the ugly side of greed and bad behavior.

Aneurin Barnard plays Richard Duke of Gloucester.  His character evolves from one that seems sweet and caring as the Duke however, when he becomes King Richard we see him transform  into power hungry and vile creature.

Max Irons as King Edward....I'm not sure about the casting with this actor.  While he does a good job acting, I don't feel that he physically fits the part.  Don't get me wrong he is very handsome he just doesn't fit the appearance of a King during the 1400's.  The portrayal of King Edward is one of a womanizer (which he was) but his real character was much richer than this.  I would have liked to see this developed more in the script.

David Oakes as George Duke of Clarence....PERFECT casting!  I can't see any other actor doing a better job!  He plays the jealous, conniving, backstabbing younger brother of King Edward with such conviction.

Janet McTeer as Jacquetta Woodville mother to Queen Elizabeth.  McTeer plays the mother figure with style and grace, portraying a character that is determined to see her daughter and family succeed.  The love that she has for her daughter is very palpable.

James Frain as Lord Warwick....James Frain, enough said. A great period actor; he never disappoints.  His portrayal of Warwick is thoughtful and insightful.

If you are looking for a juicy story filled with murder, scandal, backstabbing, and scheming....there is nothing like a story that really happened.  I recommend you give this show a try. ;-)",1377302400,248,2232,4.882666666666666
6735723,2,B00OGL6S64,"The White Queen is a ten-part mini-series based on three novels from Philippa Gregory's Cousins' War series: The White Queen, The Red Queen and The Kingmaker's Daughter. Unusually for this sort of series, the focus is less on the men and battles and more on the viewpoints and experiences of three women who played important roles in the period. These are Elizabeth Woodville, the minor noble who becomes Queen Consort (unusual in a time when the king usually marries European royalty or nobility); the pious Margaret Beaufort, the mother of Henry Tudor (the future Henry VII); and Anne Neville, the younger daughter of Richard Neville and the future wife of the notorious Richard III. Other women also play important secondary roles, such as Margaret of York (Henry VII's bride-to-be), Isabel Neville (Anne's older sister) and Jacquetta, Lady Rivers (Elizabeth Woodville's mother). This presents an interesting female perspective on a period of history traditionally dominated by accounts of battles and manly men strapping on armour.

Or rather, it would if the series worked. The White Queen may be the very definition of 'inconsistent'. The series lurches from mediocrity to being outright terrible to having a couple of pretty decent episodes and then back again. It's certainly no Game of Thrones (the huge success of which is almost certainly responsible for this series being made; the Wars of the Roses were a major influence on George R.R. Martin's books) but it often struggles to even be The Tudors.

On the plus side, the casting for the most part is good. The actresses playing the central three roles are all pretty good, though Amanda Hale's Margaret Beaufort has to cope with some pretty awful writing at times (her reaction to any crisis being to proclaim, ""This is God's will!""), with Faye Marsay (Anne Neville) being one of the few actors to convincingly age in her performance as well as appearance over the course of the series. James Frain's scheming Earl of Warwick is excellent, with his political machinations occasionally being interrupted by Gordon Ramsay-style explosive losses of temper at his allies' incompetence or bad judgement. Rupert Graves schemes admirably as William, Lord Stanley in the latter half of the series (and should be signed up for Game of Thrones as soon as an appropriate role becomes available). Aneurin Barnard makes for a convincing Richard III, who is here played as a more tragic figure doomed by circumstance rather than a cartoon villain (despite developing a passing resemblance to Edward Scissorhands by the series finale). David Oakes (George, Duke of Clarence) may be getting typecast as 'gittish medieval noble bloke', having played this role before on Pillars of the Earth and The Borgias, but he plays it very well. The weakest link here is Max Irons, whose oafish and dull Edward IV is lacking the charisma of the real historical figure.

The series is at its best when centred on a short time-period. The sixth through eighth episodes (covering the relatively peaceful period between the Battle of Tewkesbury and Edward IV's death) are the strongest, as they focus on political machinations, family relationships and the characters themselves. The ninth episode, which jumps forward to the rise of Richard III and the situation with the Princes in the Tower, is also decent. However, the first half of the series is deeply flawed. Dialogue is almost exclusively based on exposition, with people reeling off information as if from a Wikipedia entry in a vain effort to keep the viewer up to speed on what the heck is going on. Weeks and sometimes months pass between scenes with absolutely no indication of the passage of time and the compression of seven years of fairly intricate history into just five episodes (the remaining five cover fourteen years) turns out to be a really bad idea. People swap sides, often for no apparent reason, and there is a lack of depth to events. It feels like the drama bits of a good docu-drama, only without the context for what is happening (a familiarity with the Wars of the Roses - or just keeping the Wikipedia page open as you watch - is useful). These early episodes are kept alive only by the heroic efforts of James Frain and, to a lesser extent, our three leads.

That said, the series finale is pretty diabolical. The lead-up to the Battle of Bosworth and the battle itself are compressed into one hour, leaving no time for the aftermath, some of which is deliciously ironic (particularly the taught relationships between Margaret Beaufort, Elizabeth Woodville and Maragret of York). The series has no real ending, just fading out after the battle without much reflection on what's happened. This feels anti-climactic and fails to put the series in its proper historical context for those who are not already knowledgeable about the time period. My co-watchers had no idea that Elizabeth Woodville and Margaret Beaufort were the grandmothers of Henry VIII, for example, and not ending with an epilogue where Margaret sees her grandson being crowned (she died only after Henry VIII came to power) seems like a missed opportunity.

In terms of historical accuracy, the series is surprisingly good in its first few episodes. It doesn't dial back the complexity of affairs too much, although a few minor characters like the Earl of Warwick's brother, are missing. As the series goes on, however, it deviates more and more from actual history. A few times it shows some good judgement - such as managing to maintain the ambiguity of the fate of the Princes in the Tower without sacrificing the drama - but more often than not it makes baffling choices. The showdown between Elizabeth Woodville's brother Antony, guarding her son and heir Edward V, and the soon-to-be Richard III is ripe stuff for television drama but the TV show simply removes it.

However, the series ultimately has two major problems which moves it from 'watchable tosh' to 'barely watchable hokum' category. The first is that Jacquetta and her daughter Elizabeth are witches. I don't meant they are accused of being witches (as both were in real life), but they actually are witches. They use magic on multiple occasions to summon storms to smash enemy fleets or delay them from sailing and put curses on people that ultimately kill them or leave their children dead. For a series based on real historical events, this injection of pure fantasy is jaw-droppingly stupid. They don't even sell it particularly well, with the participants discussing their magic-using ways in letters and everyone around them being relaxed about it.

Secondly, the show looks cheap. It may have been made for $25 million (that's about $39 million, or a bit more than half the budget of a season of Game of Thrones), but that's simply far too little to tell a story of this magnitude. The costumes are good (blatantly visible zips aside) but the bulk of the action takes place on a relatively small number of sets or on locations re-used a few too many times for supposedly different locations. The budget problem is most notable when it comes to the battles. The Wars of the Roses turned on a series of major battles at Towton, Barnet, Tewkesbury and Bosworth Field. Towton predates the start of the series, but the other three battles are fought during it and all of them are fake, unconvincing and so poorly-staged they might as well have not bothered. In particular, the decision to film both the Battle of Barnet and the Battle of Bosworth Field (and that's 'Field', remember) in the same forest (!) is truly moronic. Armies are shown marching in single file and then rushing towards one another with zero semblance of formation, tactics or strategy. The production team only seem to have about 15 extras available and no CGI budget (a couple of shots of ships aside, there doesn't seem to be any CGI at all in the series, which is baffling as it means they can't stage any big events convincingly), so the battles then unfold in extreme close-up with no continuity from shot to shot, making it almost impossible to follow what's going on. So as to avoid showing the fact they have no extras, the director also sticks the camera on the ground aiming up at people, which gets distracting quite quickly.

Ultimately, you cannot tell the story of 20 years of the Wars of the Roses (and not even the full conflict) in just ten episodes. The pacing is shot to hell in the first half of the series, meaning most people won't stick around for the decent-ish episodes in the latter half. The budget is woefully inadequate for the scale and scope of the series, and the attempt to stretch it to cover everything leaves it looking cheap. The writing is often excruciating (though this also improves in the latter half). All of this undermines the work of some pretty good actors heroically tackling the iffy material.

The White Queen (**) has moments when it almost works, but these moments can't quite make up for the crushing mediocrity and outright incompetence of the rest of the series.",1376870400,45,9046,4.90333115610712
6735724,5,B00OGL6S64,"Before I saw this series, I did not know what The White Queen was about. I saw a trailer for it on TV and found that it was to be a TV series based on Philippa Gregory's novel of the same name. I knew of her work from the movie version of her novel The Other Boleyn Girl (a very inaccurate take on Tudor history), but have not as of yet read any of her novels based roughly upon between 15-1600's on the Tudor's and so fourth. I love Tudor history and more than that I love anything on the British Monarchy. I know a lot on Henry VIII and his wives as well as Queen Elizabeth I, but I did not have any knowledge onto the Plantagenet's or anything about the War of the Roses. So I jumped on this series and immediately began to watch it hoping it to be better than the Showtime series The Tudors.

I have to say at first I wasn't sure I thought though while the story seemed to be intriguing, I wasn't falling for the main characters like King Edward and his wife Elizabeth in the first episode, but by the second and third episode of the series I was completely hooked. I know there are a lot of reviews from critics saying the series didn't hold up to the standards they expected, but I think a lot of that was based on the first episode alone in the series and not the story all together as a whole.

I never realized how fascinating the War of the Roses was or what it was about. I think what makes this story so much more compelling to me versus other shows around the time period like The Tudors, is that it is told in the view of the woman who stood behind the throne and who shaped England's history dramatically without the world even realizing their importance to what was happening on the throne and how they could influence it. Unlike in The Tudors where it was more of a mans view on the world. Their are three main woman who shape the story over the period of ten episodes. You have the White Queen Elizabeth who was King Edwards wife, then you have Queen Anne who was Queen to King Richard III and you have Margaret who becomes the King's mother to Henry VII.

These woman are each inspiring in their own ways. Elizabeth Woodhouse is a very strong character in the story. She's not afraid to voice her opinion and stand for what she says. She was also one of the first monarch's to have her children stay with her while they were growing up, where in all other noble families you would send them away for months or years at a time to be tutored and not brought back to live with their families till after their education was completed on how they were to behave as a future king or queen. While Anne in the beginning is very passive wanting to please her family and sister, she is caught in the middle as her father tries to get her older sister married to one of the brother's of Kind Edward and keeps being tossed aside till her father needs her in one of his schemes to take the throne. Through all of this she finds her strength and takes charge of her own destiny. While Margaret is devote to god and seeing her son put on the throne at such huge odds that when you think of it, it's amazing she achieved so much with so much in front of her, when the cards seemed stacked against her.

What makes this series work so well are the different view points that are captured through the eyes of these woman. You can't help but feel for each one of them as they are pushed from one place to another, but each time this happens they rise again. What Philippa Gregory has done so well is she has shown 3 different view points of the same conflict and has shown us as the viewers different perspectives to the story line based on view you are looking at.

This series is a fast pace series as far as time lapses go. Episode 1 starts off with the meeting and marrying of King Edward to Elizabeth Woodhouse. By episode two they are married and have children and by the end you are at the beginning of the Tudor era. Even though there are gaps by years in the show it flows so well together and the drama keeps you glued to the screen. You can't help but feel for these ladies in the show.

As far as how accurate this series it to her books I don't know, how accurate it is to history I do not know either. What makes a great historical drama period piece is when a author knows how to weave the fiction on around the historical events that truly took place. I feel that as far as I can see Gregory has done just that, but just don't quote me completely on it! The magic of an author should be to captivate the audience and have have them wondering which parts are the fictitious and which are reality and when it comes to Plantagenet's history it can be hard to say what was fact and what was Tudor propaganda. Leading the reader or watcher to make up their own mind. Which is exactly what Philippa Gregory does.",1376870400,92,4822,4.185145317545748

6735727,4,B00OGL6S64,"One night early there was a preview showing of this new series from the Brits. It looks promising if a bit unorthodox in its approach to history and slips in the settings and costumes. The series is based on Philippa Gregory's novel, `The Cousins' War' and roughly the story line promises to follow these lines:  Set against the backdrop of the Wars of the Roses, the series is the story of the women caught up in the long-drawn-out conflict for the throne of England. It starts in 1464--the nation has been at war for nine years fighting over who is the rightful King of England, as two sides of the same family, the House of York and the House of Lancaster, are in violent conflict over the throne. The story focuses on three women in their quest for power, as they manipulate behind the scenes of history--Elizabeth Woodville, Margaret Beaufort and Anne Neville.

In the first episode we don't see much more than King Edward's bedding and wedding of Elizabeth, a lot of bickering, some fighting, and some castle intrigue. Rebecca Ferguson plays Queen Elizabeth, Amanda Hale plays Lady Margaret Beaufort, Faye Marsay is Anne Neville, and the remarkable actors are Janet McTeer as Jacquetta Woodville (Elizabeth's magical mum) and Max Irons (handsome son of Jeremy Irons) as King Edward. James Frain is an unusually grumpy and sour Lord Warwick and Caroline Goodall is splendid as the evil Duchess Cicely. It is difficult to tell from an isolated episode, but the series has enough interest in the poorly understood realm of the War of the Roses for American audience that it will probably have staying power.

6735731,5,B00OGL6S64,"This isn't factual by any means, but I went into this knowing that. That said, I have to say I really enjoy this series.  I'm not a fan of the main character, and by the end I was ready to switch sides and yell witch like George because I cannot for the life of me understand what Edward saw in her and surely witchcraft had to be involved. She's manipulative, power hungry, and was in fact the cause of her sons and brother getting murdered- and if you read the White Princess or watch the series you know Elizabeth Woodville doesn't get any better and never learns from her mistakes. I felt the same about Anne Neville and was shocked that I loved Anne's character in the books but couldn't stand her in the show. I've read the Red Queen about Margaret and have to say she by far is the best thing in this series. Her scenes were hysterical and I actually found myself rooting for her. I also enjoyed Richard III and felt this showed a different side of him that most never learned about.  If you want to learn about this time period, this isn't for you.

They could all be wiped out by the plague and it wouldn't matter to me.  The plot seems rushed.  It started off vaguely interesting, but not enough time was spent on character development for me.  You cannot always rely on plot and action to drive a series.  A viewer must care about the characters, especially this viewer.

6735735,1,B00OGL6S64,"OMG This is supposed to pass as history....
Nothing in this series rings true, Every thing seems to be 21st century pasted on to 14th century backgrounds.
Not only  the zippers which others have commented on, but some of the dresses and costumes that they have their characters don, are Edwardian and not 14th century. The speech and  the mannerisms of the characters are distinctly modern
Can one  just imagine a 15th century King addressed thus by a nobleman:"" King Henry, Sit down there"" I mean really, who wrote these dialogues and then there were the princesses screaming ""Daddy"" when Edward IV returns. Admittedly none of us were witnesses, but I do think that is distinctly a modern form of address for a father.  I realize that Edward and Warwick were cousins/comrades with a long history behind them but once Edward became an anointed king the equation would have changed. I cannot believe that the King would have called  Neville ""Warwick"" but Richard Neville calls Edward by his first name!!!! The list goes on and on,
 Margaret of Anjou speaks English with a perfect British accent.... but ironically the character reminds us, "" I am French""

Finally will someone tell Amanda Hale that repeated grimaces can only go so far to be construed as genuine acting ability. Lady Margaret Beaufort's character was annoying  to the point of making my skin crawl.
Gratuitous nudity has already been addressed by others and so I will leave it alone

The White Queen (2013) starts off strong, the first couple of episodes are good, but then the queen becomes a secondary character. A handful of uninteresting female characters become the main players and then many scenes are about women crying or screaming women giving birth. Women and babies. If thats what you want to watch this series is for you. The series suffers from poor lighting and camera use. Did they hire a bunch of students to make this?

This show had a good beginning, but got lost in the middle, and if there was a coherent ending I missed it.

I love good miniseries like Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989, Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002) and The 10th Kingdom (2000) because they have beginnings, middles and endings, like a good novel.

Here are a few series I really enjoyed watching more than once: Band of Brothers (2001), Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Black Sails (2014-2017), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lonesome Dove (1989), Lost (2004-2010), Merlin (2008-2012), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek The Original Series (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish, or the hundreds of other fantasy and science fiction shows Ive watched.

6735763,5,B00OGL6S64,"The first thing we must say, from my American frame of reference, is that this has nothing to do with race. This epics the Wars of the Roses -- one rose white, one red. Specifically, this series epics the reign of King Edward IV and his consort Queen Elizabeth. They are Yorks, the white rose. And, oh my goodness, what brilliant cast, each artistically depicted from the physical appearances to the garments they wore to the sets to the props and even the lighting. I literally cannot think of a mediocre actor or scene in the series.  The tale itself is so filled with intrigue that one need not fabricate, yet it takes a poetic license with detail. I was happy to see that Richard was not portrayed from a Shakespearian point of view -- which is usually the case. Again, from my American point of view, I could have found it every bit as delicious without all of the lurid sex scenes. Can nothing be left to the imagination? Ugh. Fortunately, I could fast forward through more of that, and still find it utterly delicious. This is the first series I've ever binged-watched in my life, but I just couldn't tear myself away...  I will ALWAYS wish that Henry Tutor didn't prevail, even though he did eventually give us Elizabeth I, but Henry Tutor did prevail. If only the little boys in the tower had been better protected.

too bad king edward died. would have liked to see less screwing around and more guidance of his kids...like how to fight maybe? lol ..interesting plots and revenges..sad the ending of the series didn't show who killed the first son and where the story re-begins..guess that's why they made ""the white princess""...we shall see where it goes..too bad it's with NONE of the original cast too..*sigh*",1515024000,,572,4.958333333333333

6735771,5,B00OGL6S64,"I really loved this series. From the script, to the excellent performances, to the lavish sets, it's full of period detail and technical merit. As an amateur medievalist, I was very familiar with the story, and the series sticks very close to fact as we know it, while giving a nod to the book on which this is based. Elizabeth was a fascinating, smart, engaging woman in real life (and reportedly quite a beauty) who well understood what she had to do in order for she and her family to survive in a tough society and era.  The ad sells this as a story about ""scheming"" women - I find that really cheap and insulting, and frankly that isn't what the story is about. These women had enormous heart, did have morals, and also had the brains to play the games they were forced to play from birth.  That isn't ""scheming and manipulation"", it's survival.  I want to mention especially the beautiful performance of Rebecca Ferguson in the lead role - this series garnered her some well-deserved and overdue professional attention and led to other roles.  The viewer will recognize the actress playing Warwick's older daughter as the woman playing a lead role in Poldark. And Max Irons is really fine - and great to look at - as the tempestuous, strong-willed warrior king Edward IV - the real man was as tall, as handsome, as stubborn, as impetuous, and  Max nails it. Edward is remembered as one of England's most successful kings.

You can always know a good show by how many episodes actually hold your attention. This show definitely did that! The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars was because after awhile I grew a bit weary of all of the underhanded dealings and the selfish ambitions of every character in the show. If people being back-stabby is not your thing, I would soooo stay away from this show.

It is soap opera history, complete with bits of ridiculous magic, tragic and opportunistic loves, and constant driving greed and lust as motivation. I can't say there was a plot or any story line, just a bunch of pretty scenes with a lot of undeveloped characters strung together in a vague historical chronology. The female characters are more interesting, with the religious zealot who interprets every advantage as god's will, and, toward, the end, the smug snooty teenager who figures she's going to be queen whoever wins. You won't feel anything for any of the characters, and you won't learn anything about history or human motivations, other than everybody wants to be king or get with the king.",1507420800,2,781,4.879699248120301

The characters are not interesting, they lack chemistry, the sex which is clearly supposed to be risque seems contrived and awkward (cue music... wait, he's sweating already?  But why only on one arm? and already?).  The costumes are not accurate to the time period, there's no clear explanation or backstory or motivation provided for why a widow with two children would even be so drawn to this king (especially given that he's kind of a tool) or why he would be so drawn to her.

It is pretty decent as far as that goes (it was basically gossip that Richard lll was in love with his niece Elizabeth - they weren't going to marry - I don't know of any Papal dispensation that would ok that! That didn't deter a lot of actual historic marriages/relations in the past---- uhhh..) I digress Max Irons (son of Jeremy Irons) is Edward VI and Rebecca Ferguson is Elizabeth Woodville. James Frain - a mainstay in these types of series (he plays such a good baddie!) is Earl of Warwick - The Kingmaker, Janet McTeer is Jacquetta Woodville - Elizabeth's mother. They rely heavily on the hearsay that she was a descendant of Melusina a river witch/goddess. STILL it is good - I wouldn't let the young ones watch - I mean it isn't a PBS/BBC documentary with historic facts and historians and professors talking about it - it is actors and nudity and violence - they do not show the actual beheadings but do show plenty and I do mean plenty of the birthday suits.

I do like that there is so much going on in each episode. Whereas G.O.T, because the story plot is so large and there's so much going on at once, the episodes can feel like nothing has happen. However, with both, you are anticipating the next episode so much that you'll stay up all night binge watching. lol
So, I binged watched the whole season only to find out that there is no second season. #FML
I guess The White Princess goes off this(so I've read) but I have yet to watch it.
I was pretty upset about this ending. It really wasn't a true ending. I'm guessing Game Of Thrones came out at the same time as The White Queen and trumped it.

6735844,5,B00OGL6S64,"I just binge watched season 1.  It is riveting.  The costumes are splendid.  The acting superb.  It is a must for anglophiles and anyone who loves historical fiction.  Though I cannot vouch for the accuracy of the history, you definitely get the jest of the time period and brutality of political maneuvering of the times.  The series certainly portrays the fragile nature of the life of anyone who sat on the throne or who was in line to ascend to the throne of any country. There seemed to be little loyalty within families when it came to who would or would not ascend to the throne.

I've read some reviews which describe it as porn, so I would like to address that allegation.  It is not porn and anyone who calls it that has not seen porn.  There is implied sex but in my opinion, it is done tastefully.  There is some nudity, no genitals.  Some people may have found distasteful the fact that there were teenage girls being forced (by their parents) to marry for political posturing.  In the historical context, I did not consider it to be rape when a girl was forced to wed and then have sex.  She knew she was expected to produce a male heir and would have to have sex to do so.  Women were subjugated and their lives dependent on the wishes of their father or husband. Arranged marriages, especially among the nobility, was common.  Marriage was a contract between families to gain status, money or position; and male heirs were the goal of those unions.  Social norms regarding marriage and children were much different in those times than they are now and you must keep that in mind and not judge based on what would be accepted today.  So if any of that bothers you, this might not be the series for you.",1495152000,2,1717,4.451923076923077

The cast is brilliant and incredibly talented, especially Aneurin Barnard playing Richard. If you're into untrained Hollywood actors, then watch something else. I've heard that the show isn't completely historically accurate, but, first of all, it's an adaptation, so you should expect inaccuracies (like in many other period dramas). Second, the episodes are so well written that you might as well forget about how things went in reality. I couldn't stop myself from clicking ""next""!",1494547200,5,607,5.268041237113402

6735852,2,B00OGL6S64,"Much of the acting leaves a great deal to be desired.  Several of the female roles are played in a way that makes the women they portray look more like clumsy peasants forced to put on costumes and act as highborn nobles, most notably Margaret Beaufort and the two daughters of the Earl of Warwick, whereas the older women grossly overact.  While in the broad strokes of history, the series is fairly accurate, it is overly romanticized, the witchcraft element is screwball, the accuracy of the costumes atrocious (some of the fabrics are visibly synthetic, some of the jewelry looks play jewelry from Walmart, few of the women wear headdresses and when they do, they are comically and cheaply rendered), and the palace flooring and carpets are so modern, cheap, shiny, and new, they look as thought they are fresh out of Home Depot.  The period and the characters are interesting and deserve more intelligent treatment.",1494288000,,920,4.884615384615385
6735853,3,B00OGL6S64,"I just did a marathon of this first season of the story, which I liked. It seemed to get a bit thread bare on the last few episodes, but I was already sold on it. The way it leaves off, I expected the next season to pick up where it left off. That did not happen however. I didn't see any of the same actors in the white princess series and where the last few episodes of this story begin to go off the historical path a bit more than I liked, they pale in comparison to the absolute ludicrous story line you will be able to pick up next season, with a cheap cheap cheap costume, set, story and cast. This thing started off so beautifully done, I didn't expect that to fade so quickly.

If whoever is in charge of series for Star is cutting budgets to show more profit, they are stupid. There will be no more of this crap for me. I've wasted too much time on a tv show with no clear plot. That is despite the fact that they had the books and history to go by and still mucked it up.

6735868,5,B00OGL6S64,"Five RUTHLESS Stars. This is Season 1 of ""The White Queen"", based on the ""Cousin's War"" series of novels by talented author Phillipa Gregory: ""The White Queen"", ""The Red Queen"", and ""The Kingmaker's Daughter"". With much assumed dramatic license, in this historical recreation of events involving the ""War of the Roses"", it's king versus would-be king, relatives versus relatives, house versus house versus house, commoners versus noble lineage, army versus army, spy versus spy, some seeming mysticism, and 3 very determined, ruthless females pulling the strings in the foreground and background to get or keep one of the biggest royal prizes of them all: the English throne. It's fascinating to watch the aging of the characters as the plot develops, sometimes involving multiple actors, as they age.

""The White Queen"" begins in 1464, during the ""War of the Roses"", the reign of King Edward IV, and the entanglements of the York and Lancaster families. The storyline builds steadily towards the climatic battle events and the aftermath of Episode 10, as things come to a head and all of the stops are pulled out. Some historical mysteries that remain to this day are hinted at during the show. Starring an outstanding group of actors, including Rebecca Ferguson, Max Irons, Janet McTeer, Aneurin Barnard, Amanda Hale, Rupert Graves, Faye Marsay, Ben Lamb, Freya Mavor, Tom McKay, James Frain, Shaun Dooley, Nicholas Croucher, Sonny Ashbourne Serkis, Andrew Gower, and more. Highly Recommended. Five RIVETING Stars.  (Starz Originals. BBC. A Company Pictures Production, Playground Entertainment. Rated TV-MA. Color. HD. CC. X-Ray.

Being an (armchair) genealogist, and learning that my ancestry include descendants of the Plantagenets and both Yorkist & Lancastrian Nobles. This movie just brings history more to life in real time for me.
I highly recommend doing some reading on wikipedia and familiarize yourself with the political players who were involved with King Henry VII at English Court.  It will help clairfy who's who in King Henry VII's Court.

6735896,4,B00OGL6S64,"I have always found the War of the Roses saga massively confusing.  Watching this series made it a lot clearer to me.  I wish that the conspiracy theory of Elizabeth coughing up a kid who looks like a Prince to go to the Tower to join his brother hadnt been done.  The theory is just so hard to believe that, in a way, it cheapened the story and really if you bring up that theory, where are you going to go with it besides nowhere?  And not only could the writer/s go nowhere with it, they hit a dead end made of brick and mortar and were probably hoping the viewer wouldnt notice.  If it weren't for this, I would have given 5 stars.

On the other side of the coin is the Margaret Tudor (Stanley).  What a remarkable woman and such faith to see her son through.  I wish I could have better understood why nobody bothered to kill off Henry.  They had no problem killing off other people and, as it was stated when considering the murder of the Princes, boys grow into men.  This theory never spread to Henry fortunately but again, it was never clear why it did not.

Lastly, I patiently waited a few years for this series to get on Prime.  It was worth the wait and although I know it was done as advertisement for The White Princess that begins filming this year, Im not sure I will wait five years for the Princess to come on Prime and I sure as hell won't pay for it.",1486598400,,1371,4.151515151515151

6735934,2,B00OGL6S64,SPOILERS... Until episode 6!!! I fell in love with Edward and Elizabeth relationship so romantic!  Then out of nowhere without warning you find out about his infidelity! There was no build up about Edward's change in behavior! I get kings have mistresses but the love that they shared was so intense and then the next episode Edward is behaving like a pig. It literally ruined it for me. Lady Margaret drove me nuts! Her character was so annoying.,1485993600,,447,4.730769230769231

6735991,5,B00OGL6S64,"This is a delicious series based on Philippa Gregory's historical novels about the Wars of the Roses  in 15th Century England. The name of the series derives from the House of York's emblem of the white rose. The Yorks warred for decades with the House of Lancaster, represented by the emblem of the Red rose. The characters in this very real slice of history are riveting, notwithstanding the perspective of over 500 years. I was impressed by the acting chops of all of the actors who portrayed characters great and small in this series.
The era in which this drama is set is one of the most confusing historically of any in English history. It would be helpful for any viewer to read, at a minimum, Philippa Gregory's books before watching the series, lest the intricacies of the conflict between the Yorks and the Lancasters cause the viewer to lose track of the plot. It is well worth the effort, however. The era of the Wars of the Roses was the mother of all soap operas.
One final note: it is not suitable for children.",1485475200,,1026,4.545945945945946

6736024,4,B00OGL6S64,"If you really want to hear the story of the Game of Thrones there is no better dynasty to study than the Plantagenets.  They have it all, villians, heroes, great warriors, and cowards.  Most of history portrays Elizabeth as a vixen who plotted to capture a kings heart.  Edward the IV is presented as a great king who died too soon whose only failing was a failure to control his appetite.  A totally Plantagenet failing.  The name King Richard has only appeared three times in English history.  The first Richard was the closest thing to a God of War as Europe ever came.  He was better as Richard the Lion Hearted.  The second Richard was partly to blame for the beginning of the War of the Roses.  His Uncle, John of Gaunt Duke of Lancaster had stayed loyal to his nephew after the death of the Black Prince.  When the Duke died Richard had banished his son, Henry of Bolingbroke, and attempted to seize all the Lancaster land.  Henry became the IV, his son the glorious Henry the V, and his son was the wobbly Henry the VI who fell to Edward the IV.  Oh, and Henry's claim to the throne?  Came from his Mother Margaret of Beaufort the great-granddaughter of John of Gaunt and his third wife Katherine Swynford with whom he had an affair for over 20 years.  The Tudor's can thank John of Gaunt for managing to twist both the arm of King Richard the II and the Pope to sign off on legitimizing his children by Katherine Swynford upon their marriage and failing to add the clause that would have blocked them from claiming the throne.
The White Queen is just an approach to the end of the story from a different point of view than what is usually told.  Usually, Richard is presented as an evil man who killed to innocent boys.  But of all the actors in this drama Richard the III had the least reason to kill the boys and Henry the most.  We will never know.",1484784000,26,1860,4.3604651162790695

It showed us that women who became married by arrangements of their families to raise the families closer to the reign of England could entice spouses into doing things that favored their famillies. These arranged marriages affected the future of full families. The white queen herself became queen because of Edward's attraction to her and her resistance to him until they were married.,1484438400,,404,5.230769230769231

Yes, but it doesn't drip with sappy women whose only desire is to promote the men in their lives.  They are presented as complex, multifaceted people with varying abilities and interests; some are selfless, others as are as selfish as any male political animal.  It is for this reason that I can groan through the inaccurate, even fanciful historical contrivances and just enjoy the story as a telling from the feminine perspective.",1484179200,,559,5.0989010989010985

6736171,5,B00OGL6S64,Excellent series !  I'm sure they took some liberties in the details but I believe the whole story is reasonably historically accurate.  A good telling of the intrigues and plots in establishing the succession to the throne of England.  Rebecca Ferguson leads an excellent cast without a flawed performance in the bunch.,1483488000,,320,5.115384615384615

6736191,5,B00OGL6S64,"Fantasy drama mixed with history, with a splash of action. The camera work is typically very good in this! However, some of the historical facts are embellished for dramatic effect.",1483315200,,181,5.066666666666666
6736192,2,B00OGL6S64,"This is not a bad film but for some reason, the makers of this film, i.e. the BBC believe the watchers want to watch one sex scene followed by another. The film limps from one scene of gratuitous sex to another. It is all absolutely unnecessary to the story line and the quality of the acting and filming. One has to ask oneself who would want to be an actor or actress these days. There seems to be a requirement to be able to perform pornographically. Consequently, I have to impress parents of young children and teens to not allow their children to watch this series. It is hardly what one would call accurate historically so they will not be missing anything.",1483315200,4,664,4.450819672131147
6736193,5,B00OGL6S64,"I am not one to listen to the critics, I like to judge for myself and I love this movie. Others have pointed out chronology and anachronisms, but the movie is okay with me. I wish there was a little more character development from all 3 of the books, but other than that the acting was good  and enjoyable to me.",1483315200,,312,4.114754098360656

6736202,4,B00OGL6S64,"The story line moves quickly. You donto have long before you are introduced to new characters. You learn some brief information about the characters-just enough to get the story started. Other series that I enjoy more spend an episode letting you get to know a set of characters before they introduce new ones. I rather get a good background story initially so I can understand the character as their life unfolds in the storyline. I'm not a fan of how abruptly the White Queen was introduced.  However, the series is decent. It has its fair share of love, lust, and foul play.",1483315200,,577,4.6568627450980395

6736206,5,B00OGL6S64,Fans of historical fiction will not want to miss this series.  Based on the novel The White Queen by Philippa Gregory this screen adaptation consists of 10 episodes. Each episode ends with a dramatic cliff hanger that beckons the viewer to continue on. Rebecca Ferguson beautiful and alluring as Queen Elizabeth is phenomenal. Her  character is played with intense emotion with a strong memorable performance. The White Queen casting is as close to perfect as you can get. Highly recommended.,1483315200,,492,5.1375

No matter which side of the war of the roses you are rooting for, the characters on the other side are sympathetic too. Plus, it is interesting how history and the fiction dovetail; or how common perception, say about Richard, is tested.",1482969600,,380,4.291666666666667

6736252,4,B00OGL6S64,"Very beautiful and true to history.  Followed the book quite well.  I had a bit of trouble with the love scenes.  Why is it necessary to see so many bare breast?.  It adds nothing to the story and I think it is only there for shock value.  Also, why do we have to see naked bodies intertwined, when the actors are not married to each other.  I'm no prude, but that was as close to being pornographic as I can imagine.  May be why there is only one season.  Actors were dynamic in their roles.  Least favorite was Queen Anne, who was rigid and child like.  Elizabeth stole the movie.  Have watched it through twice, fast forwarding the above mentioned scenes.  May even watch it again.",1482883200,,684,4.341269841269841

6736280,5,B00OGL6S64,The historical fiction is riveting.  Well acted.,1482537600,,48,5.857142857142857

6736285,5,B00OGL6S64,"Ok, I FREAKIN' LOVED this series!! I was transported in time and felt right there during the monarchy conflict and conspiring.  WONDERFUL ACTING. Really....All of them are TOP NOTCH.  I have no idea why this did not take off or why an immediate sequel was not in the works straight away (apparently one is now but with different actors since it's 3 years later). The problem may be that VERY few have Starz network,  but if you're a prime member or even on Amazon, order this up. Seriously DO YOURSELF a favor and watch this series. It will transport you away from this 2016 world and I think we need that more than ever now.  Bedroom scenes not too shabby either... I'm just saddened that I've completed the series and left wanting more...",1482451200,,740,4.541353383458647

6736289,5,B00OGL6S64,This loosely historical series follows the intrigues of royalty in mid to late 1400's England.  It is quite interesting and entertaining.  It is not for the children in the household as graphic scenes of violence and explicit sex abound and add little to what is an interesting historical period piece.,1482364800,,302,5.02

6736410,4,B00OGL6S64,"Great historical fiction! I love how richly developed the characters have been so far. It's very well written, and the directing is ok. Occasionally, the plot shifts, leaving gaps that make it difficult to follow the story; but, overall I thoroughly enjoy this show. (A side note for those who may be concerned about the maturity rating: The nudity is only occasional. I do think some of the nudity is gratuitous and sometimes irrelevant to the plot.)",1480896000,,451,4.87012987012987

6736415,5,B00OGL6S64,Good stuff,1480809600,,10,4.5
6736416,4,B00OGL6S64,"12/4/2016 - Like most modern historical novelists, Gregory takes a lot of liberty with the real history.  Elizabeth never slept with her Uncle Richard.  Her marriage to Henry Tudor was a gloriously happy one and their many children were intelligent, charming, gifted and religious devout.  There were other instances where the historical facts were distorted, but this was a very entertaining series.  All the nuances, political, religious, social, gender, were touched upon in this series.  Excellent scripts and very good acting for the most part.",1480809600,,549,5.411764705882353

6736421,5,B00OGL6S64,I am really enjoying this series and since Elizabeth is my 15th Grandmother I am really getting some of the details from my research straight.

6736449,5,B00OGL6S64,"This is a startling piece of historical fiction, bringing to attention the lengths to which humankind will go to achieve wealth, fame, power.
Betrayed loyalties, schemes, traps, wars, threats, violence, cruelty, long-standing hatreds, envy, hostility - along with equally passionate experiences at the other end of the emotional scale - are quite normal here as the Aengles and the Saxons war for the monarchy and the perpetuation of their name.

There is lots of talking, mostly to explain the speaker's understanding of his/her motives, the complicated history behind the acquisitions and takings of the throne, and the machinations of the human heart. Bloody business - and very good drama.

I enjoyed every minute.",1479686400,,718,5.345132743362832

6736454,4,B00OGL6S64,Very well made historical drama.  As a student of the history of this period I was impressed with the depth of real history used in this drama - even knowing it was fictionalized.

Gregory does great research and they are based on history so you can't be looking for happy endings for everyone. Well acted.,1479254400,,301,4.298245614035087

6736529,2,B00OGL6S64,"I should have been so much better.  it's would have made a great movie, but it drags as a series",1478995200,,96,3.8
6736530,4,B00OGL6S64,"Boy, can Rebecca Ferguson take a tight close up, freckles and all. She's incredibly disciplined. Knows her angles and displays strength and elegance in every scene. She's playing against some other incredible actors. Amanda Hale, who plays Lady Margaret Beaufort, is Rebecca's nemesis, one of several in the series. Whereas the production budget for a similar series, Vikings was estimated to be around $40,000,000, the production budget for The White Queen came in at around $27,000,000 USD. As far as spectacle goes, The White Queen can't be compared to Vikings in terms of scope and scale. What makes The White Queen Work, I think, are two key elements. The first is Rebecca Ferguson. The second is the set locations in Ghent and Bruges, medieval appearing cities. There's material in this series that would be a hard ""R"" rating, so be careful.",1478995200,,847,5.01418439716312

I purchased the books from Amazon shorting afterward (The White Queen, The White Princess, Kingmakers Daughter, etc.).  The casting, acting, wardrobe, scenery is the best - one of my favorite period series ever.  I believe it to be pretty accurate historically as well.  I recently watched it again on Amazon and it was just as good the 2nd time.  I can't wait for The White Princess to come out next year (2017)!!",1477958400,8,490,4.705882352941177

As for the nudity others have commented on:  That was something that happened back then and even in Biblical times.  And I didn't think that it dominated the show, so I was fine with it.  What I didn't know was that there wasn't a second season, so was disappointed to see how the show ended.

6736697,3,B00OGL6S64,"This series has a lot of nudity which seems unnecessary and  is definitely not suitable for a family show. Also, some of the actors are terrible. Also, for most of the series, even though it represented 15 years, they did not age the king and queen. The show is light entertainment and not equal to the Vikings. The king is so baby-faced, even at the end of the film when he is supposed to have aged 20 years-make-up department?

6736762,1,B00OGL6S64,"At first, I was very excited by this series, especially when the first few scenes didn't have excessive violence. However, this series has far too much nudity. I prefer shows with no nudity at all, but this show had nudity at such unnecessary times, it was riduculous. I kept laughing at the show because it was so absurd, like someone randomly talking about how they bought their shoes at Payless in the middle of an episode. Its so out of place that its comical. We can tell a character is a prostitute without seeing breasts. We can tell people are having sex without seeing breasts. We can tell that a couple is passionately in love without seeing breasts. We can tell someone is having a bath without seeing breasts. It really felt like breasts were one of the main characters of this show! If you would like an interesting period drama without nudity try Poldark. Really great, thrilling period drama! Other great period shows include Downtown Abbey, Dr. Thorne, and Jane Austen movies, though these have far less action than Poldark.

6736775,4,B00OGL6S64,"The White Queen was well done. However, it was not one of those series that I couldn't wait for the next episode. There have been series that I have ""binged"" watched. This wasn't one of them. I guess it's a matter of personal preference.",1477267200,,237,4.409090909090909

6736778,5,B00OGL6S64,"Great show! I loved it! The series is set against the backdrop of the Wars of the Roses and presents the story of the women involved in the protracted conflict for the throne of England. It starts in 1464; the nation has been at war for nine years fighting over who is the rightful King of England, as two sides of the same family, the House of York and the House of Lancaster, are in violent conflict over the throne. The story focuses on three women in their quest for power, as they manipulate events behind the scenes of history: Elizabeth Woodville, Margaret Beaufort, and Anne Neville. Elizabeth Woodville is the central character in the novel The White Queen, while Margaret Beaufort and Anne Neville are the focus of the novels The Red Queen and The Kingmaker's Daughter, respectively. However, all three characters appear in all three novels that went to make up the television series. Now I am looking forward for the sequel : The White Princess",1477267200,17,955,4.690476190476191
6736779,5,B00OGL6S64,"Based on novel of storyline of English medieval Wars of Roses between houses of York (banner White Rose) vs. Lancaster (later adopts banner Red Rose) and factions who fight for the crown while 'the kingmaker' Earl of Warwick' attempts to manipulate all sides and more. The program is full of royal court drama, intrigue, historical fiction and offers good cinematography and performances that includes well choreographed battle scenes.",1477180800,,435,5.411764705882353

6736787,4,B00OGL6S64,"Acting is spotty in cases, but the women are largely superb in strong female roles that highlight the mire they were forced to endure and yet stay strong to survive, especially Rebecca Ferguson in the title role. Lushly filmed with wonderful cinematography. Well worth the time to view it.",1477094400,,289,4.918367346938775

6736791,4,B00OGL6S64,"I generally liked it but I felt the mood got a bit heavy towards the end.  To much nudity.  The acting and the writing are excellent.  I felt the emphasis on the role of witch craft, in what I assume is a plot tied to actual historical events, was a little to much.",1477094400,,265,3.9622641509433962
6736792,5,B00OGL6S64,My mom and I are always looking for miniseries to watch and the BBC is wonderful. We finished War & Peace and thought we'd give this one a try -- we love it! I'm a fan of Philippa Gregory's work to begin with and would absolutely love if they made a miniseries of The Other Boleyn Girl. Definitely give this a shot if you're not sure about it..it's excellent.,1477094400,,359,4.217391304347826

6736798,5,B00OGL6S64,Love this show even though I had to watch each episode 2 to 3 times in order to be sure I caught everything.  Politics are very hard for me to follow.  Haha. The fact that I could watch each episode more than once and still enjoy it and still find something new in it every time makes it definitely worth five stars.  So very disappointed there isn't another season.,1477008000,,366,4.27536231884058

6736834,5,B00OGL6S64,"I really enjoyed this series because, the acting was really good, and the major events did stick to what we know for sure. Yes, there are some liberties taken (no one ever accused Elizabeth of witchcraft, only her mother; we do not know what happened to the Princes in the Tower) bit it was the license of fiction.

It is nice to have someone lay out how we came to have the British monarchy as we know it..",1476748800,,407,4.217948717948718

6736836,1,B00OGL6S64,The characters are fully developed-beautifully acted and produced-however;the sexual content is way over the limit for family viewing-I would not recommend this video because of the sexual content.

6736837,2,B00OGL6S64,"Yes, the scenery was nice, but I look at the story line. My god it was bland. The story line went like this. King has a war. King finds girl. King has another war. Wins the war. King has war with cousin and brother who betrays him. King wins war. King forgives his traitorous cousin and brother. War and more war, and in between there are sex scenes, full nudity and intercourse. Can't we go back to having great movies without it? I couldn't finish the series after four episodes.",1476748800,,481,4.355555555555555

How silly of me. I started this on Saturday and binged through all of Season One. It's currently Monday, and I have to pick out something else to watch...it's likely going to have to be a show with terrible acting and a subpar plot if I want it to last until 2017.

6737001,5,B00OGL6S64,"If you liked the Tudors, you will like this.  It is an historical drama about Edward IV and his bride Elizabeth Woodville and the trials and tribulations of being king & queen of England.  It starts 9 years into the War of the Roses and continues for about 20 years to tell their story.  Edward's brother becomes Richard III (whose bones were found under a parking lot in England a few years ago).  It is a fun story line to watch, while telling the story of an actual English king.  There is lots of drama thrown in, so it can be a little soap opera-like but that is what makes it more fun than reading a history book.  I would recommend this series.",1475539200,,651,4.252032520325203

6737029,5,B00OGL6S64,"A wonderful series for lovers of Court Intrigue. The lead characters give uniformly excellent performances, especially the White Queen's mother who was award-nominated for her terrific effort.

The one significant drawback is the startlingly rushed climax; probably a result of the show's unexpected cancellation after just one season of ten episodes. At least the show's creators wrap things up for us tidily at the end.",1475366400,,421,5.476923076923077

6737050,5,B00OGL6S64,"The White Queen is a must see  people who enjoy reading  about English history, specifically about the war of the roses era. It's told from the females' perspective. Janet McTeer does a wonderful job playing queen Elizabeth's mother. Her character is a strong woman with a gentle soul. Amanda Hale's character, Margaret Beaufort, is annoyingly obsessive about her son becoming king. Ms. Hale did an excellent job portraying her.

6737060,5,B00OGL6S64,"The series is nearly accurate historically.  It does put some myths to life such as the death of George the Duke of Clarence and the fate of the Princes in the Tower.  I enjoyed watching Richard III sitting in the back with is sly and pernicious looks during the turn of events.  The production also provided a plausible representation of the deviousness of Lady Margaret Beaufort which paved the way for her son, Henry VII to ascend to the throne.",1475020800,,448,4.575

6737101,5,B00OGL6S64,"This mini series is historically accurate for the timeframe it covers; 1470 or so, England.  It helps bring into perspective the corruption that power brings, and what some people will do for it.  The writers took some creative license, and no one can be sure what really happened outside of what has been preserved through writings and records of that timeframe.  The only character I found completely annoying was the mother of Henry Tudor.  She was playing the part of a pious woman, but constantly made everything about herself.  Perhaps that was in the writings and the actress strove to portray her accurately.  But in any case, it was annoying.  But not so much as to make me give this nothing less than 5 stars.  This series ends with Henry Tudor taking the throne.  The show, ""The Tudors"", which some may be familiar with, happens a couple generations later and picks up there.  History is important, and this series was done well.  There is some brief nudity, breasts, buttocks, perhaps an inappropriate hookup or two, but nothing too racy.",1474848000,,1050,4.810055865921788

6737331,3,B00OGL6S64,"This series starts out well. Interesting story line, nice character development, fine acting, quality production.  Got us hooked enough to keep watching.  Good stuff all around.  But as the series approaches it climax, plot and story devolve into a jumbled mess.  Pacing becomes MUCH too quick. Things start happening so quickly that I found it difficult to keep characters and events straight.  It's as though the original intent was to create a multi-season series that got cancelled about 3/4 of the way into the first season, so the writers tried to cram absolutely everything into the last few episodes.  This really spoiled the overall impression of the series. Worth a look, for sure, but prepare for some frustration as you get deeper in.",1473638400,,746,5.024390243902439

Then their real troubles begin as they attempt to hold it against betrayal, the plots of other kings or queens and the ravages of disease and time.  It makes you wonder why the adjective 'noble' has a positive meaning?  In the context of this story, a noble gesture might involve a poisoned beverage.",1473552000,,468,4.602409638554217

6737371,5,B00OGL6S64,Loved this show - ended up binge watching it while on vacation - had to steal my kids fire to keep watching when mine went flat!!! I'm not sure how historically accurate it is but it captured the scheming and capriciousness that one imagines court life would have been.

6737408,4,B00OGL6S64,"Well scripted, well-acted,  Some factual (historical) issues, but when are there not in dramatizations of history. After all, this is a miniseries. Do not use this series as the basis for any masters' thesis in history.  Still, more accurate than the Shakespeare history plays (although you should still read/watch them, because, well, they're Shakespeare).  Basically watching this series is well worth the time.  Stick with it. Find a block of time when you can binge watch -- say over a rainy weekend or if you're in bed with a cold.  Seriously -- watching in one or two sittings is best. Interesting takes on Richard 3, as well as the young princes. It does truly show (as do the novels on which the series is based) how girls were used as pawns in manipulating political power for their fathers, husbands or brothers.  And for those women who were able to exert their own influence, what price they paid.  Have times changed?  Not sure.",1473379200,,941,4.765432098765432

6737436,5,B00OGL6S64,"Impelling drama that grabs hold in the beginning and doesn't let go. The romance between the key characters through time is both hot and emotionally true. The mother/daughter relationship is a study in what makes that relationship work. To have that mother and to be that mother are equally appealing. The vital Plantagenet history lesson is almost too much to take in. Mainly because the intricacies of these relationships are so humanely crafted and explored in depth that the universality takes you deep into your own relationships, greeds, longings, loves, missteps and wrong choices and you have to pause...and process for yourself. Meantime the story has moved on and it's hard to catch up to left brain facts. No worries. No problem watching this one again. And this time I might even notice whether or not the storyline totally adheres to the riveting book. Bottom line: Especially for anyone who hungers to be swooped into another world and captured there deliciously, this is superb marathoning!",1473206400,,1005,5.096969696969697

6737477,5,B00OGL6S64,"Love. It.

 Getting completely caught up with Game of Thrones to the current wait for the next season was a little bit like quitting coffee, cigarettes, and red wine cold turkey,  simultaneously. (Which I have done, minus one of the three. I'm not @$?#ing quitting coffee.) Somehow, we discovered White Queen, and at least the tremors have stopped.

There are no flying dragons, it's true, but there are still lots of nude 'people' (R.F.) with perfect... well... everything, and oh yes, the writing is fantastic, the cinematography, astounding.

The quick and dirty: watch it.

Keep in mind that it's (fairly) history-based, so it requires that we think a little more than our iPhone overlords have trained us to, but I mean we've accepted Dinklage's accent for many years now, so come on, we can do this.  And coming away with a rough historical outline of the formation of England's monarchy and  the beginnings of the British Empire,  as opposed to having a great deal of knowledge about a land that doesn't really exist, can't possibly do us as much intellectual damage as we might initially think.",1472947200,,1102,4.881720430107527

6737587,3,B00OGL6S64,"The first six episodes were good, with captioninng.  I need subtitles because I'm almost deaf.  However, for some reason, Amazon Prime chose to remove the captions, and I can't make any sense of the last four episodes.  I also went back to some of the episodes that were captioned when I watched the first time.  None of those are captioned either.  The Americans with Disability Act specifies that all entertainment (as well as other parts of life) should be accessible to all people--including those who have hearing loss.  The removal of captions from this series violates that act.  I'm disappointed that I can't watch the last four episodes, as it would be a waste of my time.  I'll go to venues in the future that honor my disability.",1472428800,,740,4.7265625

6737636,3,B00OGL6S64,"Generally speaking, historical fiction can be fun.  Some of it is even well done.  The Tudors, for example, never kept us guessing what would happen to Anne Boleyn, but the drama remained.  Here...eh... not so much.  This is the story of a bunch of back-biting, scheming, calculating women who, though they appear to possess brains are used much the way breeding stock is used (to produce offspring).  Their opinions or desires are not really important.  But that doesn't stop them from being scheming malevolent witches.  There are so many women who look alike that it's hard to keep the plots straight, and while we like King Eddie, Queen Betsy is a bit much to take.  Okay, I know you can tell this was posted by a man.  My wife likes this show, and that's why we watch it.  If you are a man (or identify with a man) then you likely will find this better than Melatonin.  On the other hand, if you are a woman, you may enjoy it.  I did not.",1471824000,,943,4.38728323699422

6737716,4,B00OGL6S64,"The story line is excellent. It is a great artistic interpretation of events that actually occurred in history, though there are some areas where the writers really took some liberties with history.

I am not a prude by any means, but the topless women in every episode seemed unnecessary. The sex scenes were fine, but as a viewer, I found them somewhat lacking in passion. The nudity seemed more of a screen for the lack of passion than actually adding to the sexiness and heat of the scene.

I marathon watched this series in two days. Be warned, it is somewhat addicting. Thankfully it was only one season or my productivity would have seriously suffered until I completed the series.",1471046400,,688,4.725

It's not like it's historically accurate, women didn't shave at all and men certainly didn't  have waxed chests.  I want the STORY, not blurbs between sex scenes.

On the plus side, it does look pretty - the sets, the costumes, the actors, the camera work - it's all very nice, and the acting is good.

But the characters don't have much depth - even the main characters - so it gets pretty dull pretty quick. Good characters are smiling and pretty, bad ones are sneering and ugly, the family members, aside from the mother, are just basically props - even the sex and the witchcraft is kinda boring, which doesn't, I think, bode well for the rest of it, so I'm stopping.

Though if you're just looking for some fluffy middle-ages romance at the end of the day, definitely give this a shot. It's not bad, by any means; it's just not for me.",1469318400,,733,4.297101449275362

6738018,5,B00OGL6S64,"For people who love period pieces, this one is excellent. It is the thing the Brits do so welltell their own history. The White Queen covers the period from the end of the War of the Roses (1470s-1485) to the rise of the Tudors. It is filled with malice and Machiavellian cunning. Three women wish to be Queen. Elizabeth is a stunningly beautiful widow whose looks beguile the young king, Edward York. They marry without permission, and Elizabeth becomes queen. At the same time Margaret Beaufort connives to have her son, Henry Tudor, seated on the throne. She manages to accomplish this feat, but not without suffering. The third woman, Anne Neville, is perhaps the most evil. She whines, wheedles, and lies her way onto the throne. The acting is superb. The costumes and settings are excellent. The story moves at a quick pace. This is a show that is best for binge watching. There are many characters, and if you do not see the episodes close together, you will not be able to tell one male from another.",1469232000,,1008,4.636871508379889

6738044,4,B00OGL6S64,"I am huge fan on British history up until the Stuart era and have been reading about Elizabeth Woodville and the Cousins Wars for years and the only thing that I can say that this show does accurately is give you a good idea of the timeline of how things came to be and the impact that all this war and fighting had on Elizabeth and her children.  I've always felt bad for her since because of this conflict she lost two brothers, her father, her first husband, three of her sons, and was forced to go through so much hardship.  This show gives you a good idea of how the women must have felt going through all this.
Having said that I will give some criticisms.  First, this show does a very poor job in showing the maneuvers of the English court and how many retainers the English royalty had.  Like theTudors did a good job of showing that at least.  Here it just looks like th actors are in medeival times.  Second, the thing where they have Cecily Duchess of York completely favoring George and then Richard has no real basis.  The part where she says I can make George king is based on a rumor and a statement one ambassador made at the time, that was probably false, because the Duchess was well known for being an extremely pious woman and would never have admitted to having had an affair.  Plus Edward is believed to have looked like the Duchess while Edward's brothers looked like his father (as in future Richard would attest that Edward was a bastard because he looked nothing like the former duke of York).  Though true that Duchess Cecily was opposed to the marriages it is widely believed that those feeligs dissipated in future since she ended up spending alot of time with the Queen in EdwardVI's reign.  She didn't even go to Richard III coronation, and mentioned neither of her younger sons in her will.  The only thing she mentioned was that she was honored by her son his majesty the kiNG eDWARDvi of England.
Thirdly, not that the Woodville's got what they came for, but they weren't as perfect as the show seemsto portray them.  They were too aggressive in placing their political influence, and made it very clear that they had no intention of letting Richard make decisions, effectlvely alienating him before Prince Edward was even crowned.  Also they did marry their 19 year old son, John (who gets executed in ep 2) to the 60 year old widow of the Duchess of Norfolk, since she had a large fortune at her death, ironically she even outlived him.  This gave them the reputation of money grabbing family, and there were instances where the father delibrately crushed people in his way.  Though Ill say that they were alot better than Warick who this show captured quite well.  He wanted to have power for himself through Edward and when Edward made it evident that he wasn't going to be pushed around Warick switched sides.  Also historians mostly see the Warick being pushed aside not because of Elizabeth Woodville's influence but because of Edward's desire to emphasis his power
Oh and Richard and Elizabeth. . .  No just no.  Even back then it was frowned upon for a niece to marry her uncle.  I mean why did they have to go that far I dunno.  Anne Neville in real life actually liked her nieces and recieved them in great favor, and Richard according to texts seems to have tried to make Henry tudor look stupid by having Elizabeth appear in court dressed lavishly in order to spread rumors that there was an intended wedding.  Richard needed the power of the people's opinion more than anything at the time since his son was dead and tUDOR was already getting alot of support.
I like this show since it gives u a rough idea of the politics of the time and gets people interested in teh period/  And i think this is an interesting era because it literally paved the way for the ideas and religious change that startedt o happen in England during Henry VIII era.  Elizabeth of York raised Henry to make him aware that women were capable thinkers and he recognized their power, although he asserted that males were better, he did recognize his daughters' right to inherit thr throne later.  So yeah this show is a good watch",1468972800,3,4153,4.527443105756359

6738046,5,B00OGL6S64,"I'm a big fan of Phillipa Gregory's books and this series was well done. It combines the stories of Anne Neville, Margaret Beaufort, and Elizabeth Grey. If you want to find out what happens with the story at the end of the series, you'll have to read the books ""The White Princess"" and ""The King's Curse"", also written by Gregory. The series itself was done as well as Showtime's Tudor series (also available on Amazon) with beautiful costumes, amazing castles and scenery, and of course, it has alot of racey scenes too.

I keep fact checking with online histories of the Wars of the Roses, and it seems to be keeping to the facts with the main storyline.  The witch part adds some dimension too.  I really like it as a followup after finishing Game of Thrones this season.  And a great prequel to The Tudors.",1468540800,,409,4.413333333333333
6738190,5,B00OGL6S64,"This is a dramatization of the Wars of the Roses, which were fought over the throne of England in the 15th Century. It's told from a woman's point of view, specifically, that of Elizabeth Woodville, the ""White Queen."" The history of those wars rivals any romantic fantasy you can name, with love and betrayal, good and evil, and general greed for power played out against a legendary background. The writing is strong, the acting is excellent and the story follows the historical outline closely. Though violence is an essential part of the history of these times, there's not a lot of graphic violence depicted. There are tasteful (by today's standards)  sexual scenes. The romantic elements are given focus, though the other story elements are not neglected. The real Elizabeth  was accused of witchcraft during her reign and the series depicts her as actually practising the art at crucial points in the story. Most of these correspond to events the historical Elizabeth was accused over, so this is a fun element. I enjoyed the series immensely.",1468540800,,1049,4.988571428571428

6738291,4,B00OGL6S64,"First the Middle Ages did not have zippers.
 They do have all of the people in the saga required to show how Richard III became England's king. Richard's body has been exhumed so it is clear that he did have a hunchback a very crooked back and these deformities were the strong motivation for his actions. However Richard had a good reason to murder the princes in the tower but there is no.proof that he did. The fact that this  production chose not to show his deformities was a mistake. The sexual scenes are graphic, gratuitous and totally unnecessary. But I still recommend you watch this video because it is beautiful, devoid of history accuracy, but enjoyable nonetheless.",1467763200,9,679,4.745762711864407

6738309,5,B00OGL6S64,"Four queens vying for power and multiple noble houses clashing for the ultimate glory ... the crown of England, after the War of Roses. I personally could have done without some of the sex scenes but the characters stay true to form throughout, and the calculation, betrayals and ever present danger will keep you on the edge of your seat.

Some of the most unnerving moments occur as the women in one camp or another see their men ride off to battle and then wait ... sitting alone in a dimly lit room ... waiting for the returning rider with news that they are the new queen, or that all is lost (husband, land, access to their children, personal freedom and possibly their lives).  You feel it along with them.  Things could go many different ways at many points in the struggle..

I don't think the witchcraft is truthful but adds an interesting twist. To me the nudity is not necessary, the kings and his court were very provocative evidently also.

I wish the pace of the storytelling had been slower to really grasp the complicated relationships,  I loved the historical elements and even looked up more.

6738452,4,B00OGL6S64,"i watched for sheer entertainment, without in depth knowledge of historical facts, and was VERY pleased with series. I couldn't go to 5 stars becasue, for me, it was too compressed. I would have liked to see this over several seasons with more character development.

***SPOILER ALERT*** The Kings/Queens where whipped on and off the thrones so fast, and so much ""the people are saying"" was referred to, assuming they meant the ""townspeople"" or who ever they were supposed to be kinging and queening over, but I am uncertain I saw a single ""townsperson"" or villiager or any one else than the servants, or guards or heirs and battles men. Having said that, if you are watching this just for the King/Queen aspect, you are good to go. I agree with others that it ended kind of abruptly, but the whole series was kind of abrupt, to me.

Again, not vast knowledge of historical accuracy, but for me the costuming and every other thing visual seemed so deeply developed, elaborate, engaging. If there is another miniseries to pick up where this one left off, done by same writers/crew, I'd gladly watch it!",1466726400,,1101,4.729166666666667

There is quite a lot of explicit sex, but oddly, though I usually think that stuff is kind of gratuitous, in this it works because they don't exploit it. Evidently, there was less privacy for Kings and Queens. Plus, the sex, childbirth and head chopping, horrible war all bring to life what a physically punishing life these people led. The costumes are fabulous as are the sets. The script is wonderful, it's always easy to keep track of the story.",1466467200,,599,4.769230769230769

Most treatments use poetic license and oft time vivid imagination to ortray people and times. As I have only seen the first installment I may have to come back and re visit this review. However I found this first episode a bit ""forced"". Why is it when the series will go on for multiple episodes the stitching between events has to be so abrupt or forced.

6738535,5,B00OGL6S64,"I went into this series expecting to be disappointed since many period dramas have low budgets for costumes, sets and scripts. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and professionalism of this one. Even though The White Queen isn't technically a historical drama, a lot of the characters were real people in the history of the Royal lineage. Many facts have been rearranged by the script's poetic license but you still get a feel of realism throughout the storylines of each of the families at court. If you enjoy the romantic versions of period pieces and don't mind a little nudity and violence, you will enjoy this series!",1466380800,,629,4.833333333333333

The sets and costuming are really well done as is the  sense of reality that the actors bring to the show.  Not  for anyone under age 18: Explicit sex scenes.",1466208000,,326,4.4576271186440675

This series follows the books of Phillipa Gregory.  They have been very popular reads but I have not read them as yet.  I do not know how closely they resemble the books.  I am more into history and this series has a strong enough line of history in it that when it strays from the historical aspects that it is forgivable and even enticing (it is fiction).  I could have gone with a few less sex scenes and it has a few lulls in it but not enough to lose my interest.
I will keep this in my library to be reviewed later on (I rarely review movies).  I hope to see a sequel.",1466208000,,732,4.23021582733813

6738638,1,B00OGL6S64,"The one star is not because the acting or the plot line were not good.  In fact they were both really amazing.  The one star is for the amount of nudity and sex scenes that were just not necessary.  The number of sex scenes and graphicness of them did not add to the plot line, it only made the series seem trashy.  I really wish the producers, writers, and directors would realize that by adding such scenes only reduces their audience.  I have 3 daughters that would have loved to watch this show, but there is no way they could.  Honestly, no adult should be watching sex scenes like this either.",1465862400,11,599,4.351351351351352

6738763,4,B00OGL6S64,"A decent way to spend time if English court period pieces appeals. Not BBC quality (though they were involved in production), but instead classic Starz quality. No subtlety to the plot lines or performances, and much of the cast is very young. Being unfamiliar with the ""war of the roses"" period of Britian helped. Not near award winning quality, but still enjoyable for us period buffs.",1465257600,,387,4.878787878787879

6738768,5,B00OGL6S64,"The series' name 'White Queen' and cover photo are unfortunate because it looks like another Hobbit or magic-based fantasy. In reality, this is a loosely historical presentation of the War of the Roses, done in the same genre as 'The Tudors' and 'The Borgias'. The actors are wonderful, the writing is acceptable, the sets and costumes are quite good, and the photography is exceptional.

The royalty, then and now are subjected to so many mistresses in their courts that even Henry the Tudor was forced to divide the Christian religion so he can have a divorce and marry another queen. I find the acting and setting more appealing, and the sex part, it is just reality. If you never had sex in your life, then I can't blame you, but you are missing a lot, but if you have and can not take it with the story, then you are missing the part where everything in life is put together to complete the story...Remember this is a rated MA, so don't expect a mickey mouse story!",1465257600,,696,4.201492537313433

6738811,2,B00OGL6S64,This series wasn't too bad but it was more like part soft porn soap opera and part cheesy romance novel. It would've been much better if most of the explicit sex scenes were removed entirely and they let the story line and the actors/actresses be the focus.  The later episodes were much better than the first two or three.  Not a series I would buy again and not interested in seeing any future seasons of this series.,1465171200,,419,4.428571428571429

There are queens and wars galore, and plenty of political intrigue at court.  For a time, I had the fun of living in the British ""midlands"", and visited the castle of the Earl of Warrick, the ""kingmaker"" depicted in this series.

6739006,5,B00OGL6S64,"This ten episode miniseries is based upon three of Philippa Gregory's best selling historical fiction novels, ""The White Queen"", ""The Red Queen, and ""The Kingmaker's Daughter (The Cousins' War)"". The cast is simply terrific, giving outstanding performances, overall, and the production values are excellent. As this is historical fiction, and not a documentary, one should expect there to be historical inaccuracies and one will not be disappointed. It is historically  accurate in terms of big picture type, main events, but from there it somewhat digresses. Nonetheless, it provides a gripping storyline that will have the viewer riveted to the screen.

This miniseries covers the reigns of Kings Edward IV and Richard III of England. It also covers the ascension to the English throne of Henry Tudor. It focuses on three women who were to have some influence. First, there is the beautiful Lancastrian widow and commoner, Elizabeth Woodville, who would secretly marry King Edward IV of the House of York. Then there is wealthy Margaret Beaufort, the religious fanatic who would stop at nothing to make her exiled  son, Henry Tudor of the House of Lancaster, King of England. Last but not least is Anne Neville, obedient daughter of Warwick, known as the Kingmaker for his success in making his cousin,  Edward IV,  King of England. She would first marry Edward of Westminster, only son of the deposed mad King of England, Henry VI, and Margaret of Anjou. Widowed,  she would later marry Richard, youngest brother of King Edward IV, who would later become King Richard III.

While some of the machinations of these women may strain credulity, it makes for a very entertaining television miniseries. Some of these machinations are  based on historical fact, while some are not. This why it is historical fiction, with the operative word  being ""fiction"". There is some nudity, which is gratuitous for the most part, but it is fairly minimal given the fact that this is a ten part miniseries. Those with an interest in this period of English history, or who simply enjoy interesting, well done  historical fiction, will love this miniseries.",1464393600,73,2141,5.091428571428572

It effectively explores the role of women in in a complicated period of English history, and while it may vary at times from the strict historical record, the overall effect is highly entertaining. The major production companies need to keep producing such high quality period dramas, especially in series format so that character development and relationships can be fully portrayed. And the battle scenes were kept to a minimum with the emphasis being kept on story, plot and dialogue. The true test is that this series left us satisfied and yet wanting more episodes.

(Minor Spoilers Ahead)  She was portrayed as exercising very little power over her female subordinates. Contrast her with Anne Neville as queen. As the series drew to completion, I found myself wanting to fast forward to the end because I felt Elizabeth the elder's behavior was out of character.

I found a few more, and that was in the first episode alone.  I stopped there.  Can't an expensive production find funds for capable researchers? The photos of the cast tell the real story, right out of an article in People Magazine for the world's most beautiful people.  I read the book and even it was a light read, but I had little aversion to it.  This series however was not watchable, particularly the myriad love scenes that were offensive because, for one thing, they lacked the chemistry of soul.  Ugh.",1464134400,4,662,4.71304347826087

This especially shows up when an actor has a quiet voice. I especially like when I mute the screen it gives the local actors; nice trick!
the scene when the Queen's mother is dying and she is giving life and puts her baby on her mother's stomach.  It actually brought a tear to me.  You can never give enough ""dates"" when it is an historical entity!",1463788800,,509,4.260416666666667

6739289,3,B00OGL6S64,"I would give this 4 stars for the romance and drama, 1 star for historical accuracy. While the story involves 3 women, Elizabeth Woodville, Margaret Beaufort, and Anne Neville, the story is told largely from the point of view of Elizabeth Woodville (the White Queen). The portrayal is sympathetic to her and probably overlooks her worst qualities. In an areas where historical data is incomplete, the story diverges to alternative explanations for events, such as the disappearance of the Princes in the tower.",1463443200,,510,5.156626506024097

6739301,4,B00OGL6S64,"Just finished watching Season 1of the White Queen. If you take into account all of the mystery and unknown facts about Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville's reign, the show was mostly historically accurate. I really liked how they played out the Battle of  Bosworth Field against Henry Tudor. Well played imho.
A lot of things left out, but if you are looking for some history combined with drama, this seems like a good start. I cant seem to figure out if there are more seasons though!
Also, a lot of unnecessary nudity and graphic scenes, so watch your eyeballs. I did not need to see the actual removal of a baby from a womb. o. O",1463356800,,632,4.448275862068965

Even though the actors play really well I don't appreciate watching sex or nudity on the screen and it really takes away from the value of the history portrayed. Thus, I can only give 2 stars. The rating for the season should be double R, if there was such. In my opinion, it's even inappropriate for married adults such as myself.

I think the acting was good, and even if it wasn't stellar, it is an enjoyable show. The costumes and scenery are enjoyable and you just get wrapped up in the show.  I am sure there are things a true history buff could find problems with, but if you are watching this with the idea of leisure in mind, then you should like it. MUCH better than other dramas trying to be like it---for example Reign. I would place this one close to Showtime's The Tudors.",1463356800,,665,4.1

Like the enemy is my friend then my friends are my enemies down to brothers and
sisters to daughters and sons and of course to keep the fortunes amongst themselves
lets screw around with each other before and after the marriage and divide the wealth
amongst each other while killing and screwing each other with non stop envy, jealousy
and lust for power, plotting and driven by animalistic fanatisism for more and more
some goes way beyond our daily political hypocrisy by playing both side and against
each other ensuring that no matter who loses or wins they will always come out of ahead
while they slaughter their temporay kings or their benefactors who brought them to their
previous level. Full of suprises twist and turns with Shakespearean complications and with
intriguing never ending drama, tragedy and triamp the rise and fall of the nobles from the
highest to the lowest with casanovian passion between with and anything goes.
Even Sherlock Holmes or Colombo would be challenged to figure out their deveous spider
webs their deceitful plans and deeds.
I gave 4 stars for all that above but it deserve 5 star I withheld one because of the
battle field products were a little lower quality production than the norm but you don't
even ant to notice that's being way overshadowed by the whole production.
You won't be disappointed and you can't wait to go to the next episode.

I am a realist, but some of the scenes bordered on pornography and, frankly, victimized women.

6739447,5,B00OGL6S64,"For persons with some general knowledge of 15th Century England, this is a highly interesting and entertaining miniseries. For those who are not, the profusion of dramatis personae, many of whom share first names, may be confusing, especially when their changing aristocrat titles are thrown in as well. Nevertheless, kudos to Philippa Gregory, upon whose books the miniseries is based, for sorting out the many persons and their even more numerous intrigues. The story is set during the Wars of the Roses  the seemingly interminable civil battles between two branches of the royal house, those of Lancaster and of York, to secure the throne of England. The Yorkists used the white rose, and the Lancastrians the red rose. Edward IV (1461-1483), the male protagonist was a Yorkist, which explains the title of the series, White Queen, even though his Queen Consort, Elizabeth, was a Lancastrian. By all accounts Edward was a tall and handsome man, and an able king who ruled effectively and who sponsored scholarship and art. Elizabeth was by most accounts one of the most beautiful women of all England. The Wars of the Roses ended when Lancastrian Henry Tudor defeated Richard III and became king Henry VII and married Elizabeth, daughter of Edward IV and Elizabeth, Yorkists. In addition to Philippa Gregorys historical novels, interested audience may well find Shakepeare fascinating and enlightening (the three parts of Henry VI and Richard III, though none centered on Edward IV).",1462838400,,1486,5.16597510373444

my mind's description anyway. She did a good enough job. This series actually combined two books partially and
was not accurate to the book in many ways. The main inaccuracy was the ""little"" prince Richard returning home.
He may have been the guy in the second book of the series who they believe is Richard but he dies and then the
prophecy/curse takes effect.",1462579200,,476,4.678571428571429

For the most part, their ""English"" is pretty understandable and, while the sex scenes are pretty graphic, at least the couple is married.

The story of families switching loyalties to survive in a cut-throat society where noble households compete to see who can capture (and keep) the crown is classic, but the writers of this series excel in keeping the viewer intrigued.

6739526,4,B00OGL6S64,Full disclosure I have read all the Phillipa Gregory books that the series is based on so I am biased towards Phillippa Gregory.  I love her books a historical fiction and fluff reading romance novels even if they are fluff. The series combines severals novels into a mini series and since it follows the books and is BBC and Stars there are alot of sex scences and nudity. But it does follow the books well. However it is combining several books at once and each book follows a different woman in history at the same time period but the mini series follows just Queen Elizabeth Woodville/York and cuts back to the other woman which marginalizes the other woman from the books.,1462406400,,677,4.595041322314049
6739527,4,B00OGL6S64,"Well acted, well made, but too much unnecessary nudity.",1462406400,,55,5.222222222222222
6739528,5,B00OGL6S64,"As a fan of historical drama and a guilty anglophile, this is right up my alley. I enjoy seeing the venality of the ruling classes, the pomposity, scheming, bloodthirstiness, lying, bowdlerizing, amoral antics of those whom Creation has cursed with great wealth and good looks. I enjoy the squandering of power on the mental shoving matches as one cranberry brain after another jostles for the crown, only to descend even further into degenerate glory.

These folks wrote (and continue to write) much of world history and understanding them is important to anybody who may eventually be left to carry on with whatever remains of our maimed, screwed planet. The lessons are many. Beautiful though the trappings may be, the undercurrent of perversion is constant. Look out for oneself, and to the block with everybody else. Western Civilization at its brightest and the legacy that lingers portends a harsh reality for all who are not of the right 'House' -  (or race or color). The filming is pretty, the acting is fine, the direction well done. Battles are depicted without excess of vista, extras or SpFx, which is fine by me. Intimacy is sensually portrayed, even in its colder, unloving and soul-less moments.",1462406400,,1212,4.9950495049504955

For a story presented through the eyes of the women, the strongest and most interesting character was still a man (Richard). All three of the actresses who portrayed the queens were bland and unsympathetic, so it was difficult to connect with their plights. If you're interested in British history, as I am, it's worth a watch to see how they present the story, but if you're expecting an adventure or a romance, I'd suggest skipping it.",1461974400,4,510,4.741573033707865

6739681,3,B00OGL6S64,"I watched all 10 episodes and did enjoy the series. It was exciting and kept my interest. However, it jumped too rapidly from one event to another. Some of the events could have been fleshed out; this would have made a longer but better series.

Rebecca Ferguson who plays Elizabeth Woodville and later Queen Elizabeth, was amazing in this series. She is a terrific actress with wonderful depth. She is also a great beauty.  Some of the others were pretty good, but she is on a level above them all. Max Irons plays Prince Edward. He certainly looks the part of a prince. His acting is not very remarkable, however. I will say he got better as he went along. By episode 6 he was much better, although no match for Rebecca Ferguson.

Unfortunately, Amanda Hale, the actress who plays Margaret Beaufort, had too big a part for her acting ability. She got somewhat better towards the end but not nearly good enough for such a big part. I found her facial expressions and gestures very irritating.

Regardless of some poor acting at times, this is a good series to watch. I debated between giving this 3 or 4 stars.",1461801600,2,1111,4.54

All those who were engaged in these power struggles could not escape taking one side, or to survive, even both sides of their extended family feud. Everyone had relatives who had been killed. Everyone had times of danger and betrayal. The women focused on here had the most to lose. But, unlike an equally engaging civil war - The Game of Thrones - this war actually occurred wearing out all of England's resources and all of their people.

Though some of the female leads were over the top manipulative to the point of becoming annoying, I watched the entire series because I love period dramas. I did not read the books so cannot comment on how closely the books were followed. But it's a show using violence, sex and intrigue to draw an audience. I get that historical accuracy will not be followed 100% of the time, so I went into it knowing it wasn't fully based on history books.",1461110400,,468,4.517647058823529

6740051,1,B00OGL6S64,"What I thought might be a well-rounded period drama on par with The Tudors and The Borgias (both better shows by leaps and bounds) turned out to be only a slightly more sophisticated version of a bunch of toddlers tattling on each other and throwing tantrums every time they get their way. Only the setting and the costumes are better. What all of these whining characters demonstrate is utter lack of gratitude for the fact that compared to what it was like for the peasantry of the day, they all have it really good. Each of these charecters lives in a castle, each has all the money and resources they could want, and waited on hand and foot. But nooo, they have to be the king. Game of Thrones, also inspired from the infamous War of the Roses, does spectacular job of illustrating these themes and makes for far superior entertainment to boot. As to why this show flops:

The acting is middling all around even with professionals like James Frain (far better as in the Tudors, as medieval dramas seems to be his casting niche) - mainly because all of the characters are so one dimensional. There really is no one to root for in this whole affair. Anne, mother to Henry Tudor, is a delusional, sanctimonious harpy who is worse in her plotting due to the fact that she firmly believes she is on a mission from God. James Frain and his Lancastrian cabal relentlessly pursue the throne with utter ingratitude. Initially one empathizes with the hapless Lady Jane Grey, who has everyone against her from the beginning,but as she becomes more consumed by desire for revenge she gets less likable. Her husband, King Edward, seems sympathetic enough a character if you can ignore the fact that had Lady Grey not given him what he wanted he was fully prepared to rape it out of her. It is frustrating to watch the two of them continually forgive enemies that only exploit those opportunities to plot against them all the more. Edward becomes a common debauched, cheating monarch soon enough which ruins the audience' good will toward him.

All in all, any one of the series I already named will give you far better returns on your time investment.",1461024000,,2142,4.63421052631579

6740054,1,B00OGL6S64,this is soft porn with a historical plot. the directing is terrible and requires frequent nudity and graphic sex scenes to keep the attention of the audience. the acting is even worse. rebecca ferguson is seriously one of the worst actresses i've ever had the misfortune of watching.,1460592000,11,283,4.916666666666667
6740055,5,B00OGL6S64,"Started it just for fun as I have always been a big fan of British History and ofcourse the fight for the throne of England. Have watched other series like Tudors as well, but this one by far is the best (till now). Great work by the actors and amazing portrayal of events. I love the fact that they kept it to 10 episodes only and didn't try to drag it long (like other series). Rebecca Ferguson plays the part of the White Queen amazingly. I can't think of any other who could have done this.

Hats off to the directors, actors, costume designers, and everyone who worked to make this series what it is. You guys rock!! Pat your backs...",1460505600,,639,4.2809917355371905

6740074,1,B00OGL6S64,"I mean, it's Phillipa Gregory, for crying out loud.

But even so, what in the world is with the whole - the ""witch"" character is our tragic heroine - wonderful wife & mother to her husband and children, justified in her anger, etc, whereas Margaret Beaufort is the conniving, angry, bitter woman, with them going so far as to have one of her husbands call her ""the most pious woman I know.""  What?  And Lady Cecily - the lady spent her days in a convent, for crying out loud - why make her the bitter, nasty mother-in-law?

And given the ridiculous over-porn saturation in this series, we're only going to throw in one of King Edward's mistresses, Jane Shore, but to excuse it with, oh, I have the appetite of a king, but I still love you most, my queen!  Really?  Give me a break.  The guy was a sex addict, so I'm surprised that they glossed over this, given all the excessive nudity the directors were bent on throwing at us.

6740234,4,B00OGL6S64,"Let me say right at the outset that I am not overly concerned about historical accuracy in a TV drama series or a work of historical fiction.  I do enjoy the kind of speculation that Philippa Gregory engages in when the information available is inconclusive about a certain person or event. I am happy to run with any number of theories about the fate of the Princes in the Tower, I am OK with Perkin Warbeck being Richard of Shrewsbury, I am alright with Princess Lizzie having an affair with her uncle,  and I am OK with Elizabeth Woodville practicing witchcraft for real. I do draw the line at completely unattested, invented allegations like Henry VII raping his bride-to-be, but I am fine with all the rest, where there are historical rumors and allegations on which to base the speculation.  If this makes your blood boil, this show is not for you.

This series started out slow, but then gained momentum and finished very strongly, IMO.

I've read the three books this series is based on, and other books on the Wars of the Roses, so I had no trouble keeping the characters straight. I am not sure that this is a simple task for someone who has no knowledge of the period. Things move very quickly in the later episodes.
Here's my assessment of the strength and weaknesses of the show-

The Bad-
1) Visual anachronisms- Zippered dresses, concrete steps, men's jackets that look like they were bought from a department store, people without headdresses and such.

2) Some inexplicable decisions regarding the aging of characters- This series opens in 1464. Henry Tudor would have been a boy of about 7 at the time, and indeed at this stage he is played by a kid, and we see him go through various stages of growth. He is a young man of 28 when the series ends in 1485.  However, Richard III ought to have been a boy of 12 at the beginning of the series and a man of 32 at the end of it, but he is played by the same actor throughout. Likewise for the Neville sisters. Similarly, lady Margaret Beaufort looks the same from start to finish, but Elizabeth Woodville is aged a bit in the last couple of episodes .

3) Some events that took place are shown differently in the series, even though they are described correctly in the books. The execution of Hastings is left out for some reason (maybe to make Richard III look better?), and his attributes are given to Anthony Woodville. The historical Anthony was accompanying Edward V on his journey from Ludlow to London, and was arrested along the way, and later executed. Here, Anthony is in London, trying to broker some sort of deal between his sister and Richard and he is sleeping with Jane Shore. In reality, it is Hastings who had Shore as his mistress. I did not see the point of this distortion.

4) Budgetary Constraints - It showed in many ways. The sets and locations were underpopulated. The Battle of Bosworth Field had to be staged in a forest because staging it in a field would require more extras, horses and other props. The characters seemed to have a very limited number of outfits. The same buildings were being used to depict Westminster and Middleham and Clarence's residence. There just weren't enough  guards, servants, handmaidens and suchlike for it to look authentic.

5) Max Irons just isn't able to project the toughness and savvy of a monarch who lost and regained his grip on power twice during the course of the series.

That's a pretty long list of shortcomings.
Now, for the Good-

1) The agency given to the women. They are not appendages of the men. They are movers and shakers in their own right.

2) The cast- With the notable exception of Max Irons, the rest of the cast is very good.

Elizabeth Woodville is one of my favorite characters from the books and Rebecca Ferguson nails her completely. She is beautiful and smart and unforgiving and tough as nails. It isn't often that a character in film turns out just as you had imagined them upon reading the book.

Amanda Hale has a tough job trying to humanize a character that comes across a bit caricaturish in the books. Philippa Gregory evidently has Yorkist sympathies. The Lancastrians usually don't come across very well in her writings. Margaret Beaufort is fanatical and a bit of a hypocrite in the books, and though she retains those characteristics in the series, she also comes across as vulnerable and doubtful about the nobility of her purpose, which makes her less grating.

Aneurin Barnard makes a fantastic Richard III. As a nice guy who overreaches and does some questionable things and  finally sees his world disintegrate, he manages to be both morally ambiguous and oddly sympathetic. The shot of the dead staring eyes of Richard as he lies stripped at Bosworth will forever remain seared into my brain.

Rupert Graves is a riot as Lord Stanley. His dynamic with lady Margaret is great. He has the funniest scene in the series where he teases his wife about how Princess Lizzie is having an affair with her uncle. The way he pauses before describing the piece of gossip as ""juicy""  had me in splits.

3) The characterization of Princess Lizzie. Elizabeth of York is too much of a quiet, retiring, non-confrontational type in Tudor period writings. I loved that she is portrayed as a feisty teenager in this series who talks back to both her mother and future mother-in-law. She seemed so much like a regular headstrong rebellious teenager that I had no trouble forgiving her for doing inappropriate things like having a crush on her uncle and not showing a whole lot of consideration for her aunt.

On balance, I liked this very much . Aneurin Barnard has a new fan. The guy has a good singing voice. If only Richard and Henry had a sing off at Bosworth, it would save Princess Lizzy a lot of heartache.",1459123200,6,5768,4.6223091976516635

6740245,5,B00OGL6S64,"A co-worker recommended THE WHITE QUEEN to me not knowing that I am fascinated by the TUDOR era in England. I didn't realize THE WHITE QUEEN is the story of Edward IV and his commoner wife Elizabeth Woodville (the white queen of the series). I knew their story and the story of the Princes in the Tower and the rise of the Tudor kings.

THE WHITE QUEEN takes the basic facts and weaves a tale of romance, espionage, war, betrayal, lust and heartbreak. The general facts are there but the story is fictionalized to entertain the audience. I was totally hooked by the story, the actors, the setting and everything about this series. I already knew how things would turn out so I was curious as to how the story would be told. This was a remarkable time in English history when no one was safe and loyalties shifted by the day. Women often played a powerful role and their place in history has been overlooked and THE WHITE QUEEN attempts to remedy this.

It's a stylized mini-series to admire and behold. It's a beautiful and stunning series to watch. The actors are beyond compare and I only recognized one or two actors so it all seemed so fresh. The series is based on a novel by Philippa Gregory who has blended history with fiction and romance. Again, the basic facts are here but it's still a fictionalized account.

This story follows the ruling class thru it's many challenges to stay in power and to stay alive. Beautiful period locations and costumes lend to the realism of this excellent period piece.

The acting is superb, the costuming and settings very authentic-looking (except of course that everybody looks way too clean and their teeth are too white and straight), and the scripts are well written and suspenseful.  And this is even tho those of us who know about the War of the Roses know how it all turns out.  I was especially pleased that Richard III wasn't portrayed as the hackneyed Shakespearean monster of yore but instead as the conflicted and complicated individual I'm sure he was.  Plus I think it was a brilliant move to keep us guessing as to who really killed the princes in the Tower.  Buckingham?  Richard himself?  Someone else who was trying to curry either Yorkist or Lancastrian favor?  After almost 550 years, unless some new information gets unearthed, we'll probably never know.",1458432000,,911,4.75796178343949

We enjoy the casting, in that we aren't distracted by headlining actors. The progression of time feels a bit stilted, as it spans generations and people appear to age suddenly. Aside form that, at times the dialogue is hard to hear, but we like the original score at the beginning, and that the storyline tracks with historical references.

I was looking forward to the series but after watching it I feel like it just fell flat.  It was very dark and there is so much drama it  felt like nothing good ever happened to anyone.

The cast is excellent save for the Wydville family; Janet McTeer is an excellent Jacquetta Wydville, but frankly the rest of the tribe is presented as too plain.  Sir Richard & Jacquetta were famed for their striking looks, and their entire family of children took after them.  The casting of Max Irons & Rebecca Ferguson is especially good; I really believed I was looking at Edward IV and Elizabeth.  Again, the production did not degenerate Edward nearly enough for his documented physical condition when he met his end; much like ""The Tudors"" didn't do Henry VIII justice at the end with Jonathan Rhys-Meyers' physical presentation.  The history overall is good; I'm not fond of the whole ""they really worked magic"" theme that pervades Philippa Gregory's books, but that's her choice to make & she is a huge publication success.  The actress who portrayed Margaret Beaufort did an especially nice job working with a character that reads rather flat in the histories.",1458000000,,1160,5.047120418848167

The White Queen tells a story of breaking barriers and traditions to find true love.  Each epsiode is filled with historic plots to dethrone King Edward and how his brothers plot with him and against him to find their own selfish desires to rule Kingdoms and be wealthy.  Lots of lusty scenes gives way to lots of princes and princess's being born under King Edwards reign as King of England.  The costumes, set designs and acting is fabulous.  I wait for the next mini series hopeful of King Edwards daughter marrying the Tudor King and ushering in a time of peace.",1457568000,,697,4.588709677419355

6740516,4,B00OGL6S64,"I have a new found love of historical shows and movies so this is very interesting for me to watch. I would have given this 5 stars, but felt the sex scenes were a bit much and almost made me feel like I was watching soft porn. I can appreciate artistic creativity when it comes to such scenes, but would have preferred for them to have been more of the suggestive type where you don't actually see individuals actively engaging in the act. Thankfully there's so much more to this series that will keep most individuals glued to their seats. If you've read any of the books in the series you will appreciate the snippets that help bring the characters to life as tidbits of the book reference are interwoven throughout the scripts. Overall a fascinating series to watch.",1457308800,,770,4.546762589928058

6740711,5,B00OGL6S64,"This reveals just how dangerous life must have been for the royals during the 15th century. The viewer cannot help but feel that danger as the constant maneuvering goes on to gain the throne of England. King Edward marries a commoner who is labeled a witch. We get the sense of that possibility, inherited supposedly, from her mother with indications that she, Queen Elizabeth, has passed that ability on to one of her daughters. Of course superstition was rampant so it didn't take much, when her sister-in-law loses her baby boy (a precious commodity since that child would be in line for the throne) in childbirth, for Elizabeth to be accused of being a witch. Elizabeth, the White Queen,ner, is hated because she is a commoner and because she has the ear of the king. Needless to say the intrigue is relentless and exhausting. I can only imagine that life, difficult as it was in those times, was intensely more so in the house of royalty-never knowing where the next ""attack"" might come from. The women who play the major roles (Elizabeth, her mother Jacquetta, Margaret d'Anjou and Mary) give very fine performances. The minimally lesser roles of Isabelle and Anne also very well done. Max Irons, son of the actor Jeremy Irons and actress Sinead Cusak, is  King Edward. And even with his baby face, he is very convincing in the role. An excellent production",1456617600,3,1363,4.77542372881356

6740714,4,B00OGL6S64,"One of my favorite periods in history - read about the Tudors, Yorks constantly. So, the story is pretty accurate. However, way too much T & A for a story that could stand on it's own without the lure of breasts, bare butts, and R rated sex scenes.  Why do the producers, directors, etc. feel it is necessary to embellish a fascinating period piece with unnecessary distractions? No woman who has birthed 12 kids looks that good. And Edward got fat - why are we not treated to that sight?
BTW: I'm no prude, and enjoy a week-toned body as well as the next. But, there is a time and a place.",1456617600,,590,4.267857142857143

Again, don't rely of this series for historical facts.

6740778,4,B00OGL6S64,"This show was very well done. Casting was excellent, though Elizabeth of York seemed a little too forcefully acted in an ensemble of subtle-yet-masterful performances. Writing was mostly excellent, though a few episodes toward the end seemed a little out of tune in the dialogue - then again, by that point in the story, with so many Edwards and Richards and Thomases running around, I suppose even a mother must refer to ""your brother Thomas Grey"" when speaking to another of her children. I haven't read Philippa Gregory's novels, upon which this show was based, but I'm definitely interested in doing so now. And it was nice to learn about royals that were lesser known to me - Henry VIII's parents, grandparents and so forth.

As a fan of Phillippa Gregory, I wished for ""The Red Queen"" immediately after the last episode.  Whether it was a good adaptation or not, you have to love each for what they are.

I read the book and had a bit of a hard time visualizing the characters, but I may read it again now that I can put faces with names.  So far, it is faithful to the book and gorgeous to look at.  I can see why King Edward defied his family for Elizabeth, a beautiful, strong woman of great courage.  I happen to be an English history buff, but I can see how watching this series might make a buff out of those who thought they weren't particularly interested.  There is always a wide gap between fiction and history, but it often encourages one to seek out the reality after being so enchanted with the fictionalized version.  That's what happened to me at age 13 after reading a novel about Anne Boleyn.",1455580800,,844,4.276729559748428

6740970,4,B00OGL6S64,"There are many good things to appreciate about this series, particularly the acting, but what knocks it down a notch in my eyes is that it turns the screenwriting mantra ""show, don't tell"" on its head.  We are constant witnesses to characters rushing on screen to ""tell"" an important character what has happened off screen.  We seldom get to see that important event happen, and when we do the producers screw it up.  For example, the ultimate Battle of Bosworth Field, which took place in August 1485, happens in this series in a forest with snow on the ground.  Please, producers, could you not find a field to film the battle in, and do it at an appropriate time of the year?",1455580800,,678,4.532786885245901

6741081,4,B00OGL6S64,"A riveting tale, although it is quite liberal with historical accuracy.  It seems to have played up all the rumors and myths that were put out at during the reigns of Edward IV and Richard III concerning Elizabeth Woodville and her family, Mistress Jane Shore, Elizabeth of York and Richard III, and the fate of the younger of the two murdered princes, Richard Plantagenet.  Also, not for younger viewers due to a generous helping of graphic sex scenes and frontal nudity.  However, it still is a beautifully filmed story replete with beautiful faces, gorgeous scenery, and very gifted actors.  My critique is not meant to turn anyone away, as it is a pleasure to watch.  I have done so at least twice and will no doubt watch it several times again.  ,",1455494400,,752,4.659090909090909
6741082,5,B00OGL6S64,"So far, I'm enjoying it immensely. I loved the novel -- it is one of Phillippa Gregory's very best books -- and I was afraid of soiling my pleasure in the book with a made-for-TV drama. But I was wrong. This is excellent.

I will say one mean thing: somehow, I don't think William Morris wallpapers were very popular in the 15th century. The excessive use of them on the sets makes for a very pre-Raphaelite feeling to the series. But I can overlook that. Everything else is superb.",1455408000,,482,4.415730337078652

6741085,5,B00OGL6S64,"I have not read the books, and mention that so that it is clear that I watched the show with no expectations and nothing to compare it to.  I also have not studied the history of this time period, so I have no idea how accurate the events are.  But with that said, I completely enjoyed this series.  Taking the point of view the women who were influential behind the scenes during that time gives a unique point of view of the events.  I would highly recommend this show.",1455235200,,471,4.258426966292135
6741086,5,B00OGL6S64,"I truly enjoyed the book series and the TV show. Its a very different look at Elizabeth Woodville and her King Husband as they simply try to survive in a civilized uncivilized world. Max Irons is lovely as the young King looking to make his mark on the world and The White Queen is on point through out the whole series. Honestly, 1 season was all it needed and continued the intrigue of what happened to this great family and the lost two boys in the Tower.

Enjoy and research what happened to them. Very interesting. A must have.",1455235200,,532,4.373737373737374

I found it such a fascinating period of history, especially as told through the eyes of women from several generations, and from opposing sides. This series carries on the stories told in the books at a deeper level, and really brings the characters to life. It took me a few episodes to really get into this series, but now, half way through, I am fully immersed in the drama and intrigue of political life at court. Having read the books, I enjoy knowing some of the political history that preceded this time period, and some of the personal histories of the characters in this show. If you enjoy historical fiction, I would highly recommend this series!!",1454716800,,729,4.615384615384615

6741278,3,B00OGL6S64,"It was a pretty good show...for awhile. I just could not watch the last few episodes. Its sort of watching a bad horror movie..""Don't go into the closet"" ""Keep away from that door""  You see it coming from a mile away and get tired of knowing the outcome. It felt that way at the end of the series. The same old plot to be king or queen. Who not to trust, who is killing who. etc.

I really don't know what happened at the end, because, unlike a good candy bar, I could step away from this show.",1454544000,,494,4.030612244897959
6741279,4,B00OGL6S64,"I adore Phillipa Gregory, so I was excited to see this. I've only read one of the books, though, that were used for source material. I thought they did a really cool job of representing the mystical ideas that Gregory presented in the White Queen (the book). But I think it was a little harder to digest as a tv show than it was as a book. Maybe it just wasn't the right medium for me. The characters aged decades during the single season, and major battle, perhaps even a whole small war could boil up and resolve in a single episode. It was a little hard to keep track of, and felt a little superficial. Forget time for character development, which I thought largely fell a little flat. The women depicted are truly amazing, and they were as well done as possible in the amount of time they had. Four stars for a great effort, but don't watch this right after Outlander, or you WILL be disappointed.",1454544000,,901,4.369047619047619

6741294,5,B00OGL6S64,"The White Queen' has all the pageantry of GoT and all the Machiavellian plotting of HoC.
 I especially love that in 'White Queen' Richard III is a loyal and good-hearted man, turned into the  paranoid tyrant we know and hate by the crown, and that he is at last exonerated of killing his nephews.
I also love that the Kingmaker's daughters, raised as their ambitious parents' pawns, become equally obsessive and heartless players as adults.  In this world everyone is culpable and nobody deserves the crown, neither by incontrovertible blood right nor by superior kingcraft... it's all scheming, war, money, and politics.
 'The White Queen' makes an excellent companion piece to 'Lady Jane'  if you want to bracket the Tudors.  And If you want to follow the whole saga of bloodletting, ambition, and truly startling legal justifications that marked England from the death of Edward III to the coronation of James I, watch 'The Other Boleyn Girl' between 'the White Queen' and 'Lady Jane.'",1454457600,,988,4.9939024390243905

But for the love of God its almost hard to find someone to root for as the episodes progress. These entitled people with so much devote all of their energy to paranoia and suspicion rather than serving the people.

Why wasn't the kings brother happy with all that he had? Do they not see how short lived everyone's time on the thrown is? That there are other positions of power other than the actual crown and that they could spend their time actually doing good rather than plotting against each other?

The combining of the three books into one series was brilliant.  The story leads us through the events with the White Queen, the Red Queen, and the Kingmaker's daughter as based on the novels.  I loved Max Irons and I think Rebecca Ferguson was perfect as Elizabeth Woodville.  The story is fast-paced and the acting is top rate.

I am incredibly disappointed to find that they did not continue the show.  It is truly entertaining television.  If you like steamy, scandalous, period shows then you must watch this.  I am sure that there are a great many historical inaccuracies but it's a drama not a documentary. The main characters all existed and many of the events happened in real life as well. I loved every single actor they cast.  I think they did a great job.  I was so intrigued with this show I found myself doing my own research to find what had been the fates of all the characters. I was particularly interested in the mystery of the ""princes in the tower."" It's a very fascinating story of the emergence of very strong women in a world ruled by men.",1452297600,,862,4.316770186335404

6741748,5,B00OGL6S64,"The White Queen was simply superb.  So much attention is given to Henry VIII and Elizabeth I.  They seem to have overpowered the history of British sovereigns.  While fascinating in their own rights, what preceded and defined them included The War of the Roses, King Edward IV, his Queen Elizabeth, the Princes in the Tower, the downfall of the Duke of Clarence and ultimately King Richard III, and the marriage of the White Princess Elizabeth to Henry VII...so much happened during the time frame encompassed by the books.  The White Queen Season I led me to listen to all of the audio books in the series. I so wish the tv series continued for another season with The Red Queen, Margaret Beaufort.  She was quite a formidable presence in her own right.  Her invoking God's approval at every turn she makes by such tests as asking God to give her a sign if he disapproved of her plans, and upon neither hearing nor seeing such a sign, she believed fervently God approved.  Likewise, if something fortuitous happened, she could use to say it showed God's favor, too.  The books and tv series led me to a voracious appetite regarding history from this period.  It's fascinating to watch the ever constant attention to politics and  back room deals, religion and magic, familial ties.  Each book in the series adds different perspectives to the mix gives a broader and better understanding  the times.  Amazon would do well to produce the remaining books into additional seasons.  I do believe a continuing series would find quite the following.",1450483200,,1543,4.795454545454546

6741750,5,B00OGL6S64,I really enjoyed this series. It was an interesting view of the history of the York and Lancaster conflicts. Seeing it through the eyes of the powerful women involved made me think of the history from a different perspective. Of course it is fiction but it is fun to speculate and the series put a personal spin on these women (even if it is not historically correct). Now I HAVE to read the books.,1450483200,,398,4.391891891891892
6741751,5,B00OGL6S64,"Wow. I have seen many (many!) period pieces, most of them made in and about Great Britain, Brittany, England, etc. I was a huge fan of The Tudors on . . . HBO, I think it was? And while the acting on that show was fantastic, the acting on The White Queen was par excellence. And where I couldn't wait for the next romp with Henry's latest beauty on The Tudors, in The White Queen that kind of thing almost detracted from the overall story. No other historical epic got me digging into history like this one has. And the more I read about that particular era, the more astonished I was at how amazingly accurate the storytelling was! I can suspend disbelief with the best of them, but in this case, I didn't have to, and more importantly, the actual story is better than any dramatic retelling. And except for the witchcraft element - I haven't seen anything about that, although that doesn't mean it doesn't exist - it was true to form in nearly every instance - that is, about 99% of the time. That is far, far more than can be said of the vast majority of Hollywood fare telling us the story is ""based"" on a true story, or ""based"" on a novel. Well, if that were the case, why can I not recognize it from the source material?

Anyway, The White Queen excels in every arena - mystery, intrigue, action, drama, romance, and pretty much every other genre you can think of. I have already recommended the show to my best friends, and now I would like to recommend it to you. I promise, if you like period pieces like this, you will not be disappointed.",1450483200,,1549,4.323024054982818

6741759,5,B00OGL6S64,"Great series. Very entertaining, and manages to be so without a lot of violence, which I found refreshing, since many of the current medieval-inspired series' are very violent (mind you, I enjoy them too, but this is a nice break from all that). Obviously, it's historical fiction, emphasis on the fiction part. Most of the characters are from real life, but their actual personalities are obviously invented by the author of the series or the screenplay writers. If that doesn't bother you, then I'd definitely recommend the series. The acting is, for the most part, excellent, the costumes are lavish, the sets are beautiful, and it manages to keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the whole series.",1449273600,,708,4.908333333333333

6741958,4,B00OGL6S64,"An excellent production of a very good adaptation of Philippa Gregory's novel.  The acting is strong and the depiction of Medieval England seems quite realistic.  Gregory's take on Richard of Gloucester (later Richard III) is novel --especially to those of us who first met him through the propaganda of Shakespeare.  What strikes us is how beautiful (and young!) King Edward and his Queen Elizabeth are.  Since it's a story of the battles of strong-willed and powerful women, it is short on blood and gore and very long on plotting and dialogue.  That makes it in a way more suspenseful, though perhaps less appealing to the Game of Thrones crowd.  It compares well to ""The Tudors"" and ""The Borgias.""  We can only hope that there will be a sequel, Gregory's ""The White Princess.""",1448236800,,780,4.863636363636363

Not sure what else to say about it. Season Two was cancelled probably due to lack of funds.
Everything pretty much seems like GoT wannabe shows and now boobs are acceptable on American TV so that's good. Now lets take away collateral damage, happy endings, and gore!

6742235,5,B00OGL6S64,"If you enter this with the anticipation of being well-entertained, not necessarily schooled, you can sit back and enjoy - very engaging and romanticized version of the story of Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville. I did not know exactly what this was about until I started watching it (other than it was an icon in my Prime Recommended lists); I thought it was purely fiction but because of the historical bent, I enjoyed this much more than expected (like, immensely!). I agree with the other reviewers to take the history with a grain of salt, but it's intended to be a dramatization, not a documentary. It did pique my interest enough in the history to verify/research the context around it and to re-watch the Henriad*.  I found the angle from the female protagonists to give this a unique and effective spin. There is some nudity and sex, but not obnoxiously so, and might be appropriate for older teens or slightly younger with parental guidance. I do think it potentially could be a useful platform in engaging students in English history. Great casting.

* ""Henriad"" - For background to the conflicts and agendas in The White Queen, check out Shakespeare's trio of King Henry plays (Henry IV Parts 1 and 2, and Henry V) and Richard II which precedes these. I highly recommend The Hollow Crown video series (featuring Jeremy Irons and Tom Hiddleston), which is based on the Shakespearean plays. Another recommendation for the storyline toward the end of The White Queen is a stylized, alternative version of Richard III (Edward IV's brother) featuring Ian McKellen and Annette Bening.",1446336000,,1589,4.903345724907063

Elizabeth is as amazing as she is beautiful and I love the way this series tee's up to ""The Tudors"" being that the last crowned head of the Wars of the Roses is Henry the 7th - which is Henry the 8th's father. I also like the twist of curses at the end which was accurate to history (if your so inclined to believe in ""witchcraft""). I was very intrigued by the sex scenes - they really look as if they are making bare naked love which raises my eyebrows as to what lines were drawn and where!",1445817600,,686,4.325581395348837

Very fast paced, I was very confused as to how they were going to make the story last an entire season because the major plotline seemed resolved by episode 2. Whirlwind for sure.

The author does an amazing job of incorporating history with the lives of the women who were married to men of power. I loved the book and movie so much that I began doing my own research on the cousins' war. These stories are very close to accurate. The author is kinder to the reader in some areas because we are not as accustomed to the cruelty of those times but it is still accurate enough to keep the history on track. I return to this three book series again and again.",1445731200,,580,4.1875

I personally believe that if you know your history, you are secure in viewing historical fiction (meaning you can decipher what is truth and what is just good television drama).  You will find yourself googling some of the historical figures just out of curiosity.  My only complaint, is that there were some gratuitous sex scenes they probably could have done without.

6742523,5,B00OGL6S64,"This was another great show. I've watched the Tudors, Reign and this and it is all awesome. Especially since they take place in the same time period. Right now Reign is about Mary Queen of Scotts and her King Husband of France. Mary wanted the throne of England, but Queen Elizabeth, daughter of Ann and King Henry the 8th in the Tudors, became Queen when Queen Mary, Queen of England ( AKA Bloody Mary) died.

Shows like this are great for making people want to learn more about history. I didn't know much at all about the White Queen, but since I watched it after the Tudors I was interested in seeing it, since I read that her husband was King before the Tudors came to power.

I guess all I'm saying is this is a great show.",1444867200,,729,4.27536231884058

6742532,3,B00OGL6S64,I really like movies in this time period. I do like this movie very much but I have only seen half of the series. What I hate about The White Queen is the fact they have to show full nudity of her breasts and the backside of the male actors. Also the bare action of making love. What the heck! Why ruin the whole thing and put nudity in the movie? It is NOT NECESSARY to put the nudity into the movie. Really bad for kids.,1444867200,,422,3.9186046511627906

My husband and I both really enjoyed watching this series; it was sumptuous and altogether addicting to see what would happen next. The screen adaption was done very well and the added focus on the main characters relationships with periphery character enhanced the story line. This series is refreshing because it takes place  just before the often done Tudor period. I would say the casting is superb, especially the actresses who play Elizabeth Woodville, Margaret Beauford and Anne Neville. I would recommend this series to anyone who enjoys a costume drama, excellent character development rounded out with realistic dialogue and rich depictions of historical events.",1444521600,,763,5.203252032520325

6742672,5,B00OGL6S64,I actually really loved this show. I walked in thinking it would be an overly dramatic soapy adaptation of the Philippa Gregory book but I finished the series with a few new favorite actors and a show I can go back and watch again in between new content.

6742764,4,B00OGL6S64,"The White Queen was true to the content of the books from which the story came. My one disappointment was in the casting of a few of the characters, most notably the Queen and the King. Elizabeth was beautiful, but not beautiful enough to control the King and a bit too old in years for the role. Likewise , the king was too youthful and not commanding in presence. The romance was lost with the casting.
The most sympathetic character was Richard, who was well-played and well-cast. The Neville girls were also well- received.

Although I enjoyed the series, there was so very much in the books that three different series would have been more appropriate.
I liked it. I could have liked it more.",1443139200,,697,4.576

The history is fascinating and appalling. Anyone who worships royalty should watch this for a different perspective. So many innocent people killed in the name of royal ambitions.

I enjoyed the first half of the episodes and then my interest waned, although I pushed through to see how the series would wind down.

My only critique is that some of the dialogue and all of the hair, makeup and costuming just seemed too modern, and made especially the first episode or two a little corny sounding and not believable.  it seemed to improve as it went on, or either i just got used to it.  In the first episode, Warrick says to the King, ""Really?"" in a really sarcastic answer....that's a very modern day expression, and really lost credibility for me in the opening scene which is why i rated it 4 not 5.  But overall, I LOVED this series!!!",1441843200,,588,4.509433962264151

6743045,1,B00OGL6S64,"I was unwilling to watch the show after viewing parts of episode 1 due to its scenes that would be spoke of as personal and private in nature in polite society.  These indelicate scenes ruined what seemed to be an informative plot in a much overlooked time in history, which done with more sensitivity, could have been an educational opportunity to young adults for whom it would be entirely inappropriate for them to view as the show is currently presented.",1441497600,3,458,4.725

6743056,5,B00OGL6S64,"Really wonderful series! It is about the War of the Roses, a very tumultuous time in England, Wales and French history among both the ruling class and aristocratic families just as the Renaissance Period was about to begin. Filled with lots of accurate costuming, architecture, politics and some war scenes showing the true brutality of hand to hand combat with steel blades. Series is not consumed by battle scenes and their horrors but does not down play them. Rather they focus on the process and progress which led to them and the outcome of those decisions on a broader scale.  Ravages of intermittent plague are really not focused on in the first season but we're still prevelant during this period of time. Perhaps second season will give this history making its due. Really looking forward to the coming season.",1441497600,,819,4.892086330935252

6743104,5,B00OGL6S64,I have been reading this series by Philippa Gregory.  The television version of the book is very true to the written story.  There are a few inconsistencies but nothing that changes the substance of the story.  I will be checking on Amazon Prime for additional television renderings of these books.  I loved the show.,1441152000,,317,4.814814814814815

6743116,3,B00OGL6S64,It doesn't compare to the Tudors series but I'm enjoying it. I just finished reading the White Queen and the Red Queen and this series follows the books pretty completely so far. Ms. Gregory developed the characters more fully of course and I wish there had been more onscreen chemistry between Elizabeth and Edward.,1441152000,,316,4.87037037037037
6743117,5,B00OGL6S64,"Haven't finished the entire series yet, but what I watched so far have enjoyed greatly! I just finished reading The White Queen novel by Philippa Gregory, which this series is based on. I loved the novel and was very pleased at how well this series followed so closely to the novel. I love historical fiction and this series does not disappoint, the costume are wonderful, battle scene's very realistic and of course you have the age old problem that England has faced for centuries. The never ending struggle for the throne. Excellent series a must watch for anyone who loves historical fiction, especially British history.",1441152000,3,624,4.9523809523809526

6743122,5,B00OGL6S64,"From what I understand of the period, the characters in this production and the quality of the productionitself were very accurate and engaging.  The only issue I had was that Richard III has scoliosis.  The character who played him clearly did not, and Richard's infirmity played a big role in his life and people's reactions to him.  Other than that...great work, well acted, and engaging.",1441152000,,391,4.984615384615385

6743127,1,B00OGL6S64,It was shallow. It was more like a cheaply written historical romance.  More about sex than any real plot line.  Explicit nudity should be called out in the description.,1441065600,2,169,4.793103448275862

We were surprised at how much care was taken with historical accuracy, remaining for the most part faithful to facts as far as we know them. There is so much debate about what actually happened that it would be impossible to make any claims to complete historical accuracy, but this show did a very good job of trying.

Overall extremely well acted, directed, and filmed. If I had to compare it to another modern series I'd say it's actually rather close to House of Cards as far as the story goes: centers on politics of the time, love affairs, and backdoor schemes for power. The only detractor is that it was a one season shot that covered the entire reign of the York's.",1440720000,,651,4.769911504424779

6743348,5,B00OGL6S64,"It is very hard for me to find a show that grasps my attention, but I am very pleased I stumbled onto this series. The only downfall is that there was only 10 episodes.  The story line was intriguing and the cast was wonderful. I personally felt there were too many sex scenes, but that is to be excepted from a Starz network show. I will definitely be watching this again at some point.",1440028800,,387,4.22972972972973

6743373,5,B00OGL6S64,"A fantastic mini-series based on the novels about three strong, ambitious women. It's rare that movies or series devote themselves to the ambitions of women without portraying them in a malicious light. None of these women are perfect; however, their strengths, fanaticisms & ambitions portrays women as I've never seen before in their era. At a time when women were viewed as mere property--daughters to be married off for profit, given in marriage to men not of their choosing, submissive women used as pawns in the games of fortune--these women knew what they wanted. Almost every woman character in this series have iron wills of their own. And even when they don't have it in the beginning, they evolve and in the end, even to their own detriment, these women become forces to be reckoned with. Don't miss this beautifully adapted series. I've watched it a dozen times and each time, I marvel at some new tidbit that I'd missed in previous views.",1439856000,,951,4.840490797546012

6743408,4,B00OGL6S64,"I liked it a lot.

The extended sex scenes aren't necessary. The analog to this might be long-winded car chases that seem obligatory in the movies.

Besides that caveat the story lines are quite compelling. How they match the real history of that time I do not know.

The big draw back now is the last 3 episodes won't play. The footage keeps cutting out and has screen-freezing fits that don't go away.",1439596800,,403,4.493150684931507

6743413,4,B00OGL6S64,I love to learn history as an adult.  This pre-Henry the VIII was very well done (not as good as the Tudors in costuming and set).  The series emphasizes women's role in history by portraying mothers as schemers yet politically clueless.

6743450,4,B00OGL6S64,"I really enjoyed this series.  I studied British History in college and am fully aware of the areas that were condensed or expanded to fit the narrative story.  None of it significantly damaged the history and much of it made the story accessible and easy to understand for non-students of history.  Every bit of history we have is presented through the lens of the one who recorded it so looking at these events from a specific angle does not make any other view less real.  All that being said, I feel like this is one of the cases where history is better than fiction with all of the intrigue, double-dealing and second-guessing.  An absolute chess game played with the lives of the court and country folk alike.",1439510400,,715,4.5984251968503935

6743452,4,B00OGL6S64,"Yes, I admit that I came late to this program series. So many projects, so little time.
This is a fine piece of work by accomplished professionals. The cinematography is of
the highest quality (interesting overhead shots, for example), the production values
are outstanding, the script executed well, the credibility high--far higher than, for
example, another 'big name' series on the same general subject area that has attained
cult status. It is particularly pleasing to see a production in which the women get fair
treatment alongside the men (note to male chauvinists: if not for a woman, you would
not exist).
As for Rebecca Ferguson . . . words almost fail me. Her acting puts her in the top
rank of current women actors (check her out in the new Mission Impossible film
for another stirring example). Her diction is flawless, contrasting in this case with
the distressing Estuaryspeak of so many English actors and presenters today, where
'I' so often emerges as 'Oi' ('Oi loike' for 'I like') as a particularly egregious example.
Ferguson's French manicure strikes a slightly discordant note--it seems unlikely for
the era but some knowledgeable critic will no doubt set me straight if I am wrong, but
the devil is always in the details and this cost a star in my evaluation.",1439510400,,1284,4.921658986175115

In history the White Queen was accused of magic by her foes, but this drama adds it as an integral part of her character and the story. One other point in caution.

6743495,3,B00OGL6S64,I liked the show but it gets 3 stars because of the explicit sex scenes. I understand sex happened back in the 1400s but I don't need to see it in such vivid detail.,1439078400,,165,3.8823529411764706
6743496,4,B00OGL6S64,"We ordered this show due to the fact that it was advertised on Amazon as 2 Seasons.  You can imagine our surprise, when we finished Season 1 & actually, there was no Season 2.  Totally disappointing!  It was a wonderful movie, but ended abruptly.  Considering it was produced in 2013, it's doubtful we will ever see the conclusion.  A lesson learned - check each season before begininning to watch it.",1439078400,,401,4.671428571428572
6743497,4,B00OGL6S64,"Good, quite watchable, but not terribly engaging. We have watched 2 episodes, so far, and will watch more.
The time is the 1400's, the place is England, the setting is the War  of the Roses. Elizabeth Woodville and Edward IV are the central characters. Not as 'gory' as 'The Vikings', but this era was rather brutal. There are some exposed bosoms and backsides, so be prepared if this concerns you.
The historical aspect seems to be fairly well done and reasonably accurate. At least as far as my knowledge of the people and era are concerned.
I'm keeping 'White Queen' on our watchlist.",1439078400,,587,4.699029126213592

6743505,4,B00OGL6S64,"I first had an interest in ""The White Queen"" about 2 years ago. I tried the first episode, but I never finished it. I tried revisiting it, but I think I just couldn't get into it because it was a drama, which is a genre I don't lean towards. I've given it another try after watching ""The White Queen"", Rebecca Ferguson, on the big screen opposite Tom Cruise in the latest Mission Impossible. I've completed 4 episodes of season one as of the writing of this review and I'm really into it. It reminds me a lot of Game of Thrones with all the scheming being done in an attempt to gain the throne of England; except in this case, the context is based on actual historical events. The acting by everyone involved is amazing. It's an ensemble cast; however, each character really adds to the plot and each performance contributes to the series.",1439078400,,839,4.454545454545454

6743543,5,B00OGL6S64,"Fans of SHOWTIME's The Tudors will be encouraged to pick up this series as quickly as possible as it is a prequel of sorts to it.  White Queen goes back a generation to the War of the Roses and tells the tale of the rise of Henry VII (although he's not the main character in this story).  It details just how complicated and convoluted British history is with all of the twists & turns, shifting alliances and betrayals.

The ensemble cast is impeccable with Max Irons as a jolly fellow who does his best to be a good & just king (Edward IV) who marries a commoner.  Rebecca Ferguson is stunning as Elizabeth, the commoner who becomes queen of England.  Tudors alumni James Frain once more dons his medieval garb and portrays Warrick, the sinister brother of Edward.

Like The Tudors, this series has a genuine didactic feature;  I learned a lot from both series about an epoch in British history that I knew precious little about.  Both series are uncensored & uninhibited and do a fabulous job of taking the viewer back to the Middle Ages.  For lovers of history (like myself) this is a can't miss.  Who were Edward IV, Elizabeth Grey, Richard III and Henry VII?  Watch this series and by golly you'll find out.  Can't wait for season 2!!",1438905600,,1240,4.511210762331839

For those interested in British History of this era I would highly recommend her whole series.  Their portrayals were very similar with a few major differences, such as the survival of the younger prince.  Sharon also referred to the possibility of his existence, but did not have him reunited with his Mother, The White Queen.

6743713,3,B00OGL6S64,"I heard this was a decent show and though I would give it a try. I rounded 2.5 stars up to 3. It moves through history too fast and doesn't give you a sense of passing time. It all feels as though things are happening all within a week or two when in reality years are going by. There is pretty much near to nothing in way of action, and it's dry and boring. All in all, it looks like someone has been trying to capitalize on the popularity of 'The Tudors,' and the mythical Middle Ages blockbuster,'Game of Thrones."" The characters aren't developed well and it gives you no reason to cheer on, or hang onto a character. The problem is that 'The White Queen,"" is a mailed in hit or miss, for me, it's definitely a miss.",1437523200,3,719,4.179856115107913

6743719,5,B00OGL6S64,"This is the story of the three women that schemed their way into the throne. Elizabeth Woodville is a commoner from the Lancaster family. King Edward IV falls in love with her. After this, a series of turbulent events make this series a must watch. Beautiful sceneries, intrigues, passion and political turmoil. These are the events previous to the Tudor dynasty. If you love this kind of story, then I recommend you watch it! I absolutely loved it. It is important to say that it is based on Philippa Gregory's novel, a historical fiction author.",1437523200,,547,4.768421052631579

6743723,4,B00OGL6S64,"I enjoyed this series, for the most part, I'm not sure how authentic it was as far historical events. The period clothing  was peppered with modern technology though. As zippers in the 1400's had not yet been invented and many full shots of dresses with full length zippers were shown throughout as one example. I tried to ignore those obvious details.
  I would have preferred them to have sex in private. There are a lot of more creative ways to imply two or more (in this film more) persons engaging in intercourse without  showing glimpses of gyrating unclothed body parts. For one thing the brain of the viewer fills in a much richer picture of the act than what they show grunting on my TV.  Or maybe that is all the director and actors gets from sex, it's a sad possibility. Which  it left a lot to be desired.
  The way they showed the violence was very creative, less graphic, it left no doubt in ones mind about what took place but left off most of the gore of the disgusting things that they did to each other.
  Also the movie did a good job of portraying the lack of science and importance of superstition, church and religion. The limit of medical knowledge and how much risk they were to dieing of commonly solved ailments of today was accurately portrayed making one realize that it more luck than skill or wit that resulted in the royal lineage.
  The scenery, castles and women's hair do's were all really incredibly beautiful.
  Story line kept me interested through the series and I found it entertaining and interesting with the actors playing their parts well.",1437523200,,1582,4.5836298932384345

6743728,5,B00OGL6S64,I just finished reading the book by Phillipa Gregory and enjoyed it very much. Iwas actually really excited when I found out it was a TV series before I finished reading it.

6743732,4,B00OGL6S64,"I really enjoyed the series but I thought it kind of faded at the end. When you are basing things off of historical events, you are confined to the record of history but I felt that it limped to the finish line (so do most series, so that is nothing new). Felt that it was a great series regardless and even as a history buff, opened my eyes to a subject that I thought I knew a fair amount about (prompted me to go and do some reading on it and learn more about this period of time).",1437523200,,484,3.9489795918367347

The series by Phillipa Gregory is phenomenal, and this series misses so much of the great story. However, it was fun to see all of the different story lines play out together, rather than keeping them all separate (as happens in the books).

6743776,5,B00OGL6S64,"A superb dramatic series, fittingly-cast, excellently-acted, and historically accurate (as well as racy) enough to present a relatively true-to-life picture of how the upper echelon of that time, not so differently from now, faced not uncommonly having to put aside love and affection for power and position in an arranged marriage, while maintaining viewers' attention during some of the more complicated twists of plot and action! The characters masterfully show us how following one's heart requires strategic manouevring, in order to bring off union with one's true love, while holding onto the reins of power and preserving one's reputation and the support of the people, by dispelling rumour and innuendo that could topple one at the apex of power.

6743802,5,B00OGL6S64,"This is my first review. Ever. For any Amazon product.  But that's how much I loved this series. It was compelling enough to rewatch. Compelling enough to make me pine for it every time I scroll past it and wish there were another season.
Don't get me wrong, this series scarcely nods at fact; I've got a Bachelor's degree in History that I have to hide in a drawer every time I watch this.  That said, the series makes suspending disbelief a seamless process, because the set design, good acting and quality writing transport the viewer to the world of The White Queen.  I'm a huge sceptic of Philippa Gregory, who wrote the book that the series is based on.  She takes already salacious history and vilifies female figures just for kicks, then claims her work is historically accurate.... but fortunately for all of us, the 'based on' accreditation has never been more accurate. It is based on, not a translation of her work to the screen.
So, in rough summation, even if you don't tend to enjoy historical shows, this one might change your mind.  Historical inaccuracy can be dismissed because the show weaves its own world.  The condensed course of time speeds the action, to prevent the torpor that can haunt historically based programs.  Perhaps most importantly, this show gives viewers what they wanted but never received when they went to see ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" or ""The Tudors.""",1437177600,,1392,4.75103734439834

Other than that it's a thoroughly enjoyable video based on the Tudor royalty and War of the Roses in England's fifteenth century.

It showed the complexities of rulership and politics clearly while making it credible thru the excellent directorship throughout the series. The story of those vying for the crown is interwoven with history and yet the movie keeps to the personal drama of those involved.  Since this captures a relatively short period of history, it would be difficult to stretch into a longer running series, but I sure would have loved for it to continue!  The plot ever thickens! Too bad it could not have encompassed a longer period of history.

I tried to watch the Tudors and was bored and confused. I've never seen game of thrones. But i really like this series. The pacing is perfect, not too slow not too fast. The characters are likeable, the guys are gorgeous. My favorite is the emo brother with the big eyed and wavy hair. *Swoons* So gorgeous!

I understand most of whats going on. Only the religious woman, lady Margaret, I don't quiet understand. I don't understand whats going on with her other then she really wants her son back. But she is still interesting and the actress who plays her is fantastic.

Im glad i gave tgis series a try. Very emotional and entertaining. The actresses and actors in this are phenomenal.

However, this series is so well done.  The casting of characters, the costumes and scenery are excellent.  I highly recommend this series.",1435708800,,294,5.170212765957447
6744047,4,B00OGL6S64,"I really enjoyed this miniseries, as it was entertaining and somewhat historically accurate.  It was much better than 9th Grade World History, that's for sure!

The only complaint I have, and why it didn't get 5 stars, was the gratuitous sex and nudity.  There seemed to be a lot of unnecessary sex scenes, the WORST one being between the uncle and niece.  That was so disgusting I almost threw up.  There really is no historical account of that so what was it there for?  Just to gross everyone out?

Anyway, overall it was good.",1435708800,,530,4.574468085106383

Schools and universities will find this a great basis for discussions about the Middle Ages in general and the Wars of the Roses in particular. But more than that, it is simply great entertainment!",1435449600,,504,4.804597701149425

6744185,5,B00OGL6S64,Ready for the next season!  Interesting about those times!  Shows how mothers and fathers sell/marry off their daughters for titles and property. Raise their sons to be King.  Do ANYTHING to make it happen!  All the innocent in between getting slaughtered.  Sooooooooo glad I was not born then!,1434931200,,294,5.041666666666667

6744187,5,B00OGL6S64,"Interesting to watch, though not historically accurate.  Disappointed to see Henry Tudor seem to be a ""follower"" and not a leader.  Also disappointed to see the interaction between Elizabeth and Richard.  That ""twist"" was rather perverted and while, it could have been in keeping with the twists and turns of political ambition of the times, I seriously doubt it's accuracy and there is no historical evidence to prove it.",1434931200,,422,5.086956521739131
6744188,3,B00OGL6S64,Personally i find the show entertaining and intriguing but it can be a little corny sometimes. I like the bits or history that are woven in. Its not for everyone,1434931200,,161,4.4

6744198,4,B00OGL6S64,"They spent money on this show, and it shows! Very good cast and excellent story, although somewhat bloody in parts.

6744207,4,B00OGL6S64,I'm a Plantagenet fan so I enjoyed seeing Edward IV and Richard III brought to life.  This is a somewhat accurate account of the War of the Roses from the women's point of view. And they had more power than one would think!  The production quality is top notch.  It's entertaining and beautifully done.  I also love the music.,1434672000,,326,4.47457627118644
6744208,5,B00OGL6S64,"Fascinating!
I happened to buy the 6th book of this Philippa Gregory series. When I realized there were 5 preceding parts, I searched and am so happy I found these videos! They brought the story to life for me and now I'll continue with the rest of the books I purchased (through Amazon!).
I cannot express how highly I recommend watching The White Queen.",1434672000,,355,4.5625
6744209,5,B00OGL6S64,"The Authority Really Is Behind the Throne! Great story line - while historically inaccurate in many places, it still was a good binge series. The characters were believable and I found myself cheering and booing and checking the internet to see if that part of the story happened! Of course I didn't like how women were treated as chattel but the women found wily ways to move THEIR cause forward. ""Dumb as foxes"" still works today",1434672000,,431,4.684210526315789

6744214,4,B00OGL6S64,"I like reading about this period.  There is so much court intrigue, rivalry, and changing of loyalties.  The acting was very good, sometimes even excellent.  There were, in my opinion, way too many sex scenes.  They could have left out one of the episodes for all the cumulative sex scenes.",1434585600,,290,4.74

6744237,4,B00OGL6S64,"It's interesting to start, but grabs and holds on as it evolves. Perhaps the most telling piece is that it emotionally hangs on after it's over.

I couldn't wait to see more and often looked at more than one episode at one sitting.  The stories about the royals in England are always full of adventure, terror, love and joy.

6744313,5,B00OGL6S64,The White Queen's time period of The War of the Roses was a time filled with intricate royal politics.  Superb casting allows the viewer to focus on the realities of the danger and the power struggles that were so much a part of the lives of the royals and anyone connected with them.  Nothing brings the strategies and the intricacies of these times to life as the good visuals that are so much a part of the White Queen. Even someone who is not necessisarily interested from a perspective of historical accuracy can easily be caught up in the drama and its participants.,1434412800,,572,4.543689320388349

6744327,5,B00OGL6S64,I thoroughly enjoyed this program and was sad when I reached the end of the last episode. Highly recommended.,1434412800,,109,4.7894736842105265
6744328,4,B00OGL6S64,The sex scenes in some of the episodes make it unsuitable for younger ages but other than that it is a very interesting series.,1434412800,,127,4.333333333333333
6744329,5,B00OGL6S64,"I always read Philippa Gregory's books about historical figures and just love them.  When I heard that This saga was going to be on TV I was immediately excited, then sad because we don't get Starz.  So glad it made it to Amazon Prime!!  And I wasn't disappointed at all.  This was three books that run concurrently all put into one drama.  The casting was good, the screenplay stayed true to the books, and it was totally enjoyable.",1434412800,,433,4.5

6744333,4,B00OGL6S64,"I loved the story, but this should have been two or three seasons.  At least.  Watching Elizabeth give birth to a new baby each episode was a little disconcerting.  No timeframe should be this compressed!",1434412800,,204,4.771428571428571
6744334,5,B00OGL6S64,Loved it!  I do hope that someone will do the sequel of Henry Tudor's reign.,1434412800,,76,4.066666666666666

6744337,5,B00OGL6S64,"Really enjoyed this, more historically accurate than I anticipated.  Some choices that were made are based on historian's conjecture as well.  Well acted, just an all around good show (especially for history buffs like me)",1434326400,,222,5.314285714285714

6744345,4,B00OGL6S64,"Beautifully staged, shot and acted -- as most BBC programs we see are.  By the time the 2nd to last episode came on, we had lost track of who all those would-be kings were;  but, by the final episode, all was explained.  Glad to have seen it by bingeing rather than week by week when it was on Starz.",1434326400,,300,4.0508474576271185
6744346,4,B00OGL6S64,"I liked the intrigue, manipulation, back stabbing that everyone, especially the women engaged in to promote their personal ambitions or those of their children, husbands, etc.  You see how power changes some for good and others for bad, who start with good intentions but are either corrupted by power or influenced by their loved ones with very clear intentions of being king or queen.",1434326400,,386,5.03125

6744352,4,B00OGL6S64,"The tug-of-war for the throne of England was intriguing to watch.  All three women, Elizabeth, Margaret, and Anne, had legitimate reasons for scheming to win the crown for their husbands or heirs.  Having known very little about the War of the Roses, this series was a great tutorial about Henry Tudor's rise to the throne.",1434240000,,323,4.8545454545454545

6744361,5,B00OGL6S64,"We hear so much about Henry VIII it was very interesting to see what transpired 40 years before his reign. The female characters were very defined and the violence was not blatant. I believe there is a saying ""Uneasy rests the head that wears a crown""  and this show demonstrates how true that was.",1434153600,,298,4.518518518518518
6744362,5,B00OGL6S64,"A very enjoyable TV series. Ok, not 100% historically accurate, but then I am not sure that any period piece truly is, and there are definitely liberties taken with literary license...such as a few witches in the mix. Regardless, for me, what makes a series worthwhile is the entertainment value, especially the performances, and I felt that the actors and actresses portrayed their characters quite well. Some perhaps overly dramatized, but still extremely enjoyable. Watching the drama unfold with the who-dunits and the who is going to get it was paced well. This series should appeal to those who like mystery and intrigue, mixed in with intense familial relations, and a bit of love and lust thrown in for good measure (yes, definitely R-rated). Not as action-packed as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Game-of-Thrones/dp/B00DY64CR4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Game of Thrones</a>, not as sexually brutal as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Tudors/dp/B00O8MBMT4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Tudors</a>, but if you like those two series, you should like The White Queen.",1434153600,,1163,6.509677419354839

The mini-series skillfully wove all three stories (The White Queen, The Red Queen, The Kingmaker's Daughter) together seamlessly.  The War of the Roses is a fascinating period of English history and the mini-series brought the characters to life brilliantly and passionately. If you enjoyed The Tudors mini-series, you will love The White Queen.",1433808000,,502,5.25

The history of the royals, especially in this and the following time period are fascinating and a study in both how good and how evil people can be.

It could be an interesting series for family viewing but with the violence and sex, obviously it would not be a consideration.

6744522,2,B00OGL6S64,"The storyline, scenery, set and costuming is fantastic and worthy of four or five stars.  The two stars is because of the completely unnecessary scenes of nudity in every episode that took this from being something that I could watch with my family to something that was adult only.

It is just sad that most shows like this now seem to feel the need to make it into basically porn to get viewers.  The story in itself drew me in.  It is well done with a fun plot and the romance is great...but then you just took it too far and waaayyy too often.  Sometimes I can skip past scenes like this in shows and enjoy the rest of it. But there is just way too much way too often in this one. Disappointing as I would've loved to continue watching.",1433721600,2,597,4.219298245614035

A fantasy piece focused on the women should have worked, however, the writers simply warmed over every cliche they could find to produce this work. The tagline ""women wage war"" is a joke. All the women in this series are powerless without their men, including the witch. How does that work? What good is it to be a witch who can alter the weather but can't stop her man from whoring around? These women are whiny, needy, and weak.

6744604,5,B00OGL6S64,"The White Queen: Elizabeth Rivers- First of all, I wish to make mention of all the wonderful, brilliant, and altogether mentionable, REVIEWS I have read through before I decided to watch this Historical (fiction-like) mini-series.  I have read, more devoured, the novels.  Ms. Gregory pens a most clever tone in all of her works, to me this is undoubtable.  However, most who would even think of watching a show like this, are all too prepared to see it mashed up into pieces, finely or not-sliced and diced.  Reality hangs ever near the senses of those like me, who devour shows such as this.  THIS is a work of fiction and history mixed, focusing on the lives and drives of, not the men, but their women: queens, duchesses, princesses, Countesses...titles are just words.  However, in this particular time period those word-titles meant the crossing of barriers large and small. Nothing without a price, seems the primary lesson.

People here have completely picked up the info that this wonderful work is also, historical fact, for the most part.  A bit tender, bent-but nevertheless, fact.  In writing that sentence, I have to completely swing over to the production itself.

In a word?  Splendid.  Oh yes.

THIS production, as intricate and complex as it must have been, is beyond most of the adjectives I can consider, here.

I  could have spent several more happy hours watching additional episodes, it's that finely done.  Now, why couldn't I write something as good? Damn, what a task.  The garb, the sets, the special effects, all were fabulous to see.  There was no dearth of fine performers here, the intimate struggles for power, the manner in which we were shown this slice of history.  I simply cannot write more without possibly becoming repetitive.

IF I could have one bit presented with a tad more accuracy, it would be the assumption of the practice of Witchcraft.  There is no evil or devil in the craft.  As a consummate pagan, in the real world I am also by family,  a witch.  The representation in this series, has deemed that behavior/beliefs/ or reasoning  to be  evil and manipulative,  here assumed the primary life qualities of witches.  .Just that, a point of view.

In sum, this is a series to get your teeth into. One episode blends rather seamlessly into the next.  That kept me from sleeping a couple of nights.  Had to watch ""Just one more"" episode.  I highly recommend this series to anyone who can explore a time period not their own, but one painted in sublime colors.  This one is a keeper which just entered my wish list.  :)",1433030400,,2565,4.754545454545455

And, yes, there is gratuitous sex galore, but I think it's pretty safe to say this entire series was written as a soap opera anyway.

Interestingly enough, The Other Boelyn Girl (the book) started a real passion for me, to include all things Tudor.

It's a good series. Don't expect serious, studious historical commentary. Think of it as Tudor brain candy. :)",1432944000,,511,4.543478260869565

6744755,5,B00OGL6S64,Good action and interesting story line.  You couldn't write a more crazy story if you tried.  Everyone was corrupt or power hungry.

I wander what Phillipa Gregory thought when Richard III's skeleton was found with its clearly twisted back, because her Richard shows so such affliction.

It's fun and often painful to watch the struggles for power between the most powerful men (and women) in early England and Europe and the subjugation of the general populations. Soldiers are and always have been mostly cannon fodder for the ruling classup to and including WWIwhere they fought and died for the Kaiser, the Tsar and King George V, all ""royal"" cousins. Between these three cousins, they killed and maimed over 37 million people just over families feuding over power and land.

Read the book first and then watch the series. I liked this series better than Anne Boleyn, also based on Gregory's book. There're a number of characters and events that are key to Henry VIII inheriting the throne. I knocked out one star because of the nudity (though not in every episode) and sex scenes. I don't think those scenes added any value to the series. Still, I'm really looking forward to the next season.",1431734400,,570,4.543689320388349

6745008,5,B00OGL6S64,"I loved this show!!! It's like the Tudors but I would almost go as far as to say it's a little better because they leave a lot of the soap opera stuff behind(even though the show centers around powerful women) and it's a very fast paced one season series. If you enjoy high budgeted period shows like Rome, The Borgias and Tudors you would be doing yourself a disservice by not checking out The White Queen.",1431561600,,407,4.368421052631579

6745018,4,B00OGL6S64,"It's a bit of a royal soap opera, but I found it entertaining. If sex scenes curl your hair, I don't recommend it. Storks don't deliver heirs or spares, and they make it abundantly clear, though the scenes are brief when they happen. It is presented as a part of this world, not a romp. Rebecca Ferguson makes it worth watching in my opinion.",1431475200,,342,4.359375

6745028,5,B00OGL6S64,"Entertaining and somewhat educational. It is like the prequel to ""The Tudors."" Stimulated me enough to want to learn more about King Edward IV.

6745033,5,B00OGL6S64,"I do love a good period piece and this certainly qualified.  Everything from the sets, locations, costumes, script and acting were top notch.  Its filled with drama, romance, angst, heartbreak and a little bit of humor here and there.
If you know a bit about this period in history then it gives you some different theories as to what happen to the princes in the tower and other events that took place during the War of the Roses.
I especially enjoyed the perspective of the untold stories of the women involved in this part of history.  The wives and daughters of noblemen who played a part in shaping England's history.  We've seen many films regarding Queen Mary, Queen Elizabeth I, and Anne Boleyn, but what about the women that came before them?  The White Queen gives us some of those stories in a brilliant and wonderful mini series.",1431388800,,841,4.655405405405405

6745049,5,B00OGL6S64,"I love the TV series THE GOOD WIFE.  Why?  Extraordinary female characters.  If you like complicated, strong female characters in a historic period where they are not expected try THE WHITE QUEEN.  Now you history buffs, just take a deep breath, it is loosely based on English history, very loosely.  So forget that and enjoy the plat lines with the history presented.  The actresses, superb !  The cast is not made up of household stars for America but Rebecca Ferguson, Amanda Hale, and Faye Marsay deserve praise. But the females go on, Veerle Baetens, Janet McTeer, Julie Aubrey are juysta few more excellent women in strong roles.  Hey the series is free with PRIME.  Jump on that

6745130,5,B00OGL6S64,"Wow! This took me to the period and gave me a look into the politics that we surmise must have been prevalent. Although the witch-craft stretches the imagination, (not a bas thing) this is really well-done.",1431043200,,206,4.75

6745137,3,B00OGL6S64,A different take on Britishmonarchy that takes liberty with traditional facts.  Too much sensationalizing and not enough true history for my tastes.? Similar to Reign in quality.,1431043200,,178,5.592592592592593

6745145,4,B00OGL6S64,"I love historical fiction and this was a very good series.  I was a little disappointed with the witchcraft/supernatural part of the story because while it made for a good story, I don't think it was true to history.  The one thing that really annoyed me the most was the fake fur on the costumes.  Seriously, colored fake fur!  I think wardrobe could have done better with the fake fur.  It was way too fake looking.  Also, these are nobles.  Would they wear the same garment day after day?  Anne Neville wore that green dress with the awful fake fur every day for a very long time.  I expected much more extravagant gowns for the nobles.",1430956800,,639,4.439655172413793

6745149,2,B00OGL6S64,Might have been better except for the sex scenes.  A bit too much to recommend it.,1430956800,,82,4.125

6745151,4,B00OGL6S64,"Very well done...acting is superb.  However, the plot moves along rather quickly with little explanatory dialogue to keep track of the history and the characters....and especially their relationships.  I have read all of the books, so was able to keep up, but my husband had to stop and ask me quite often....""who is this""....etc.  The series packs a lot into each episode.",1430956800,,373,4.983870967741935

6745158,1,B00OGL6S64,"I guess this was supposed to be a story about the Wars of the Roses in the 1400's. But I found it hard to follow all the characters, and much of the ""action"" was about (and vividly displayed) sex between Edward IV and a woman by the name of Elizabeth (NOT the Elizabeth born in 1533 who became the best ruler that England had seen in a long time). I only watched 4 episodes, and gave up on it.",1430956800,5,393,3.9873417721518987

6745162,4,B00OGL6S64,"I really enjoyed this production.  I wish I had watched it BEFORE I watched ""TheTudor's"" because it is about the years before Henry VIII. So if you like this genre, watch this one first. There is a lot of history. However...there is a lot of gratuitous sex scenes that could have been done a bit more tastefully and most really unnecessarily added....in my opinion...and easy to fast-forward through if you don't appreciate watching those scenes. I am so glad I was not born then. Women were so mistreated and abused.",1430956800,,517,4.7444444444444445

6745169,5,B00OGL6S64,"Love it.  It explains so much of the history of England immediately prior to the Tudors.  I think the acting is fine, and the sets and costumes are beautiful.  Hope they run another season, so all of Gregory's books can be included.",1430956800,,232,4.476190476190476
6745170,5,B00OGL6S64,"Very informative history of the rise of Henry Tudor to the Throne as King Henry III.

This is for you!_",1430784000,,336,4.234375

All of the actors were very well cast, although Edward IV could have been taller and looked more like his actual paintings!  I think the role of Richard, Duke of York (later Richard III) was extremely well done and appeared to me to portray him more as a victim of circumstances than cold and calculating.

I am not as familiar with this time period so it may not be historically accurate but interesting still. Phillipa Gregory the author of the book this series is based on must be proud the depiction of women is exactly how she writes.

6745369,4,B00OGL6S64,"This series would receive five stars except for its gratuitous nudity.  In the most boring way, you can expect that every episode will have its nude scene. This was a BBC/Starz co-production.  The version for the BBC did not include this element.  For some reason, Starz felt it was obligatory for the American audience, so it was shot just for us. How thoughtful!  In spite of this irritating pandering, the series is extremely well-done.  The directing and all technical elements are quite good.  Some of the photography is breathtaking.  All of the actors are young and very talented.  Though they take  arguable views about certain historic events and people, the scripts, which are based on historical fiction, are good.  As long you don't view it as defining absolute historical truth, this drama is very enjoyable.",1430265600,,821,5.014814814814815

It may not be completely accurate historically but if I want facts I'll read a textbook. Her books grab me from page 1 until the end & this series is basically 3 books in 1. The writing (in my opinion) is good, the acting is good & the pace of story telling is good. The actress who plays Queen Elizabeth is breathtakingly beautiful & the actors who play her children could quite literally be her real children. They're resemblance is uncanny! I also like the actress who plays Jacquetta (Queen Elizabeth's mom). My only criticism is the amount of nudity & the sex scenes are fairly graphic.

6745485,5,B00OGL6S64,"I love this show for the historical fiction that it is. Phillipa Gregory is a hack as far as an historian but as an author she is a juicy enjoyable readable hack, but the twists she throws in should NEVER be used as reality for any truth of events that actually took place.

The show is very enjoyable, slightly better production than the Tudors, but highly anachronistic as far as costumes. Despite all that I found my self fully invested in the story by the end of the 2nd episode, and my husband was fully engaged by the end of the 4th. My heart did break for certain characters deaths and I found myself wanting to stab others in their evil little hearts.

The execution of Margaret Beaufort was extremely disappointing however. While they focused on her piety, they made her seem like a loon. All records that I've come across indicate she was a stoic serious women with high composure. She did not ""break down"" at least not according to the Tudor propaganda machine.

I would like to see a story done on the back bone of something like Jean Plaidy or Allison Weir. I respect those two authors for their research and historical fiction equally. PG is bubble gum history and fun, but not meaty.",1429747200,,1198,4.511520737327189

6745518,4,B00OGL6S64,"The White Queen is very ""Game of Thrones"" with a mix of Girl Power!  Not exactly historically accurate.  I'm pretty sure most Kings back them didn't stop battle plans to ask their wives their opinion and then follow it blindly but if they had the world may have better a better place :)  If you watch with with the mind set of ""This is more of a what if women weren't crushed by the male hierarchy"" series then it's a good show.",1429660800,,428,4.195121951219512

The White Queen is a look at fifteenth century power struggles that are eerily characteristic of today. Money may have replaced swords, and the titles may have changed, but people have not. On another note, it is also interesting to see how powerful women were, even though their social and political status back then was nowhere near as great as it is today. One small disappointment is the occasional use of witchcraft.",1429574400,,501,4.905882352941177

What it lacks in action,battle, scenes, though there a few,  it makes up for with a fascinating story line, wonderful characters and suspenseful plots. As a huge fan of the Tudors series I enjoyed this one just as much. I watched the ten episodes over a three day period and was sorry there was not more of it.

6745638,5,B00OGL6S64,"Authentic and accurate portrayal of the 1400's era. I think after Game of Thrones came along and was so popular that a lot of knock offs have begun to pop up. Don't get me wrong, that's a good thing! And this series, The White Queen (so far) has been very interesting. This series is acted well. The directors got a good feel for the 1400's; because in reality, the dark ages of the 1400's were muddy, nasty, and only the Royalty and other upper society people such as priests and merchants were somewhat educated and could read,  whilst the other 99% of the population living in the cities lived in squalor and were illiterate. Sicknesses and diseases were rampant because of ignorance,  no one had a clue as to  what a germ or virus was. The scenery that this series is being shot in is breathtaking, no fakey sets here. And the actors are all convincing, the female actors aren't bodily enhanced babes, and the truth is, most men and women of royalty (because of inbreeding)  rarely looked like Brad Pit, or Angelina Jolie. So the male actors are fit and intense, but not Chip N Dale models. And everyone at least looks like they can actually ride a horse. In other words the cast was picked to portray ""the reality"" of the era.  Okay, the cons: E gads! have you EVER SEEN so many beheadings!?!? And that crown is like a hot potato! It has been on so many heads in such a short time that it must be a ""one size fits all"". The plotting and deceit whirl around so fast one can hardly keep up with who is who and what is happening. Allegiances, fealty, and trust is like a whisp of smoke, there one moment, gone the next! And I hate to even mention this...REALLY I do...But, I've seen more naked breasts in six episode of TWQ than I have ever seen in my entire life! And most of them were not pretty breasts either. I would have much preferred that some of the actors kept their tops ON. BUT, once again, the wardrobe, nudity, muddy cloaks, and a fantastic understanding of armour, weapons and the horses (which were beautiful and obviously superbly trained as one would expect for a time when horses were of  paramount importance) emparted a real feeling of authenticity. So all in all this is a good series. I have enjoyed it. I'm giving this a fiver because of the unabashed accuracy. The writers and directors didn't hold back. Would I recommend this to friends and everyone else, ABSOLUTELY yes. I like the grit of this series, but the plotting was just too much. If you dozed off for five minutes, the crown would he on someone else's head....and there would be another head rolling off the chopping block!",1429315200,,2612,4.465408805031447
6745639,3,B00OGL6S64,Great show. Wish it wasn't so sexually explicit or I would watch more than the 1st episode. There are still some of us out there that want good drama and having the sex or violence be illuded to rather than seen on screen.,1429315200,,222,4.186046511627907

6745642,5,B00OGL6S64,"I am really enjoying this first season and like the choices of actors for the parts.  I'm sure there are challenges to historical accuracy in some of the storyline, but overall it seems portrayed very well and helps to bring history to life in a way that is more readily memorable, as you can associate a face and potential character with the names, as well as the weaving of layers of relationships - much like it is to remember personal family history and it's nuances, as opposed to memorizing general history from a more linear textbook scenario.",1429228800,2,550,4.670103092783505

6745644,3,B00OGL6S64,"My husband and I are Britophiles, so when we discovered a piece based on a novel by Phillipa Gregory about the period that precedes Henry VIII and the Tudors, well - we had to see it.  That said, we can only wonder about the veracity of some of these intrigues, but then, it is historical *fiction*, and in this bodice-ripper kind of atmosphere, I would put the emphasis on the *fiction* part. (For instance, I doubt that everyone was so terminally good-looking or clever and had perfect pearly white teeth.)  But it's good entertainment and at least we have some better idea of the conflict between the Lancasters and the Yorks.  Enough that maybe I'll have to go back and actually read about it.",1429228800,2,697,4.604838709677419

6745762,4,B00OGL6S64,"Tired of endless series and movies about Henry the Eighth?  If so, try Henry the Sixth instead!  Set in about 1450 in England, this series highlights the long-term struggle between the houses of Lancaster and York over the English throne.

Henry is actually a side-show in this series as he is already mentally ill and incapable of understanding what is going on, and he is shunted aside early on.  Instead, the series focuses on the new King Edward and his struggles with his brother and the traitorous Earl of Warwick.

The show is well made with strong, believable acting and high production values (great costumes and backdrops).  The plot is fairly easy to follow even if you don't know much about English history.",1428883200,,719,4.804878048780488

I really enjoy the characterizations and the intrigues that are woven into the story. The violence is not too graphic which I appreciate but there is a lot of sex and nudity. I am not a prude but I think it is important to point this out for those who may want to know.

6745831,5,B00OGL6S64,Very good so far!  Lots of good action scenes.  Makes you realize how hard it was to live as a Royal during those times.  It seems like they always had to look over their shoulders to see who was trying to displace them from the throne.  It was a tug of war.  Good storyline.,1428710400,,275,4.018518518518518

6745835,5,B00OGL6S64,This TV series was recommended to me by my daughter; we were talking about the lack of women leads on television lately. These women are the real leaders of the British Kingdom and the show is lots of fun to watch.,1428710400,,214,4.2439024390243905

6745851,4,B00OGL6S64,"Great story, as long as you keep in mind that it's a story. Not a ton of historical accuracy, but it's entertaining and always quite nice to look at beautiful people. Phillipa Gregory never said she was writing biographies. She's taken a lot of creative license and I think that's ok.",1428624000,,284,4.588235294117647

6745853,5,B00OGL6S64,"I enjoyed this depiction of the The White Queen, the first of the three novels by Philippa Gregory, the other two being The Red Queen and the Kingmaker's Daughter.  I found the episodes to be quite engaging and presenting women's perspective of history, so lacking in real history. The cast is superb!  Too bad that the BBC did not pursue making the rest of the trilogy.",1428624000,,370,4.590909090909091

6745855,5,B00OGL6S64,"This show definitely had me hooked at the first episode with the romance between Elizabeth & Edward, and some very hot sex scenes. Now all I wanted was for them to be alright, and not knowing anything about history, it was a suspenseful ride! It's highly watchable, even though there's practically no sex after the 1st episode. Still a very compelling story, and a great love story too.",1428624000,,386,4.6911764705882355

6745875,5,B00OGL6S64,Complex.  Make House of Cards seem like child's play.  Download the ancestry chart for King Edward and the Tudors (on Wikipedia) and have it by your side to keep track of all the characters and the intermarriages and birth of heirs or potential heirs.  Truth is stranger than fiction and the 1400s exemplify the complexity and dark side of humans and family and politics.  All the actors are superb and the period costumes are amazing.  Used the actual castles for the settings.,1428537600,,478,4.780487804878049

6745893,5,B00OGL6S64,"Having read Phillipa Gregory's books, the series interested me. It has not disappointed. The cast is excellent and the series sticks to the storyline in the books. Ms. Gregory has made a career of researching as much as possible as there is no great cache of diaries and letters that perfectly describes what went on during those turbulent times (letters frequently ended with 'Burn this!') and fleshing out the characters. There is more gratuitous nudity and sex than there needs to be but I am hooked by the other great things about this series. I can't wait for next season!",1428451200,,577,4.78
6745894,4,B00OGL6S64,Ended too abruptly. Left too many unanswered questions and too much liberty was taken in changing history to make a more interesting movie.,1428451200,,139,5.086956521739131

I've actually watched the series twice now which is very unusual for me.  But there is so much action through all of the episodes, that I had to see it 2 times to catch everything.

6745923,4,B00OGL6S64,"A well acted period drama for those of us interested in English royal history.  Actually, the themes of this drama are timeless even if the personages are powerful members of the royal court in 14th century England. There is no end to the machinations of princes, kings, queens and courtiers in the quest to gain and keep power.
 I found the series to be very modern in it's managing of character development. Many a minor character and occasionally a major one is sent to his doom because of misunderstood or misperceived motives.  Everyone suspects everyone else of plotting for advantage and advancement.  The divided loyalties, suspicion, intrigue and down right paranoia make for a faster pace than many period dramas in which there is more dialogue than action. If you enjoy the genre, this drama will keep your interest.",1428364800,,827,4.928057553956834

I watch television shows as if they were long movies- I get lost in the fantasy. For me, this show not only kept my attention, but my fingers were drawn to the ""Next Up"" button- one episode after the other!  The only disappointing moment came when the credits ran at the end of episode 10..... they should've kept the story going.

Otherwise (if you don't SCREAM and King Edward constantly forgiving the Duke of (I forget) and his brothers after the countless times they try to take his throne, kill me, kill his family and heirs ....

The queen was pretty decent and loved the king, so why didn't anyone see that? Jealousy...pure and simple. I don't know how anyone would want to be royalty...it seems like a lot of incest and inbreeding-No wonder they were all crazy! Looking forward to the next season!",1427328000,,414,4.608108108108108

Another reviewer pointed out that the witchcraft included in the series would not have required much of a stretch to believe, and I was glad I read his review before watching this series. I think he's right. The show appears to have been carefully researched which made it that much more interesting. Of course, this far out in time, we're not going to know every detail of the lives of these people; but the historical events were there, and the details were plausible if not absolutely certain. It's not for kids, if you're wondering (sex and violence).",1427328000,,619,4.794392523364486

I was sorry when the series ended and had wished that the story would go on with the daughter Elizabeth and Henry Tudor.

6746495,5,B00OGL6S64,"As someone who watched and mostly enjoyed The Tudors, I find The White Queen so much more interesting and compelling. It is well-acted, beautiful and beautifully filmed, and has just the right amount of magic. Magic runs as an undercurrent throughout the season and delicately balances the realities of burnt witches and Arthurian legend.

For some reason, I found this Jane Austen quote bouncing around in my head during the first few episodes:
I read it [history] a little as a duty, but it tells me nothing that does not either vex or weary me. The quarrels of popes and kings, with wars or pestilences, in every page; the men all so good for nothing, and hardly any women at all  it is very tiresome: and yet I often think it odd that it should be so dull, for a great deal of it must be invention. - Jane Austen

Instead of being dull, the political intrigues and courtly slights are the compelling sword play in this series. I think Jane would have been pleased that the story is told through the eyes and words of women. The philandering king is portrayed as buffoonish. His extramarital romps are not celebrated as Henry's are in The Tudors, but rather are seen as his weakness.

I was tempted to budge watch this series, but they are so lush and engaging that I have been trying to watch them more slowly. If you are looking for a new British period drama, Look no further than The White Queen!",1427155200,,1403,4.490196078431373

6746573,5,B00OGL6S64,"Having read all four books that comprised the dramatization of the White Queen I have to say that I was very pleased with the outcome.  I found the book details became a bit repetitious (and on occasion contradictory) since the same events were witnessed and reported through various principal characters who obviously perceived them their own priorities and agendas. The screen writers synthesized the four books into a well conceived whole, while still maintaining the contradictory and contentious nature of the main characters.  Production values and costumes were lush and the acting was excellent.  Very well done, and looking forward to the planned (I hope) Sequel, The White Princess.",1426896000,,692,5.330275229357798

6746635,3,B00OGL6S64,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

OK so my historical background of this war is rather limited. I found the ""War of the Roses"" to be about as convoluted as this inception and was prepared to expect less from the get go.

I did not find the sex scenes gratuitous, but the harrowing birthing scenes ad nauseum, pahleeze! I imagine this POV was to exhibit the empowerment of women but I never really appreciated this in dialogue, presence and plot. All I perceived was fear, suspicions, witchcraft, voodoo, and plain ol sissy stuff. Everyone was polluted with a power trip and was a predictable plot element.

Lady Margaret's facial expressions were painful vs sympathetic and found her role annoying and discomforting. Her ultimate reward for her patience and strong beliefs were powerful but diluted with her poor acting.

I had no concept of how intricate the plot thickens as the series progresses and was ill prepared for the complexities as I did a power play and watched the entire season in 2 sittings. What did viewers do after an entire week of not recalling names, faces, goals, and devious deeds. This timeframe represents an incredible history lesson and the producers needed to slow down to allow us fledglings to comprehend the full repercussions of family ties.

High recommend for dysfunctional family sympathy and a hint of how crazy royal life was for a spell. I do not think the peasants were as much affected as their lives were already horrific. Dark material with few breathers.",1426723200,,1506,4.8671875

If that doesn't register with you youngsters, believe that scheming and plotting have no boundaries here.  I've only watched the first four episodes and I'll jump on episode 5 as soon as I can.

I also liked that it is much less violent than The Tudor's and Game of Thrones.",1426723200,,246,4.326086956521739

6746699,5,B00OGL6S64,"Sure this is fiction and not exactly how it happened, even so the lives of the kings and queens had to be something like how they portray it in this miniseries- scary and exciting, and we already know someone was always trying to make a play for power, and knock whoever is on the throne off.  I researched to see how far this series strays from the historical facts, and the author does get the players and the main events correct.  So for me this is one way to learn about history that is not so boring, just keep in mind it is still fiction.",1426723200,,544,4.171428571428572

6746711,4,B00OGL6S64,Loved the book and enjoyed the series.  Casting was excellent.  Costumes and scenery were authentic.  My only criticism is regarding the sexually explicit scenes.  They did not add to the story in any way.  That limited what could have been an enjoyable family series into an offering for a  restricted audience.  We need more programing that offers history and drama for intelligent youth.,1426636800,,390,5.095238095238095

The scripting and story line well done and the cinematography beautiful. The story and characters convey  a sense for the times and places where these events took place. The  politics of the period were played out with war, beheadings and intrigue. The varying clans and families always jokeying for ascendancy to the throne of England. Potential Kings and Queens alike invovled themselves in spying and sometimes deadly events to gain an advantage. This series will hold your attention and have you looking forward to the next episode.",1426636800,,649,5.113207547169812

6746737,4,B00OGL6S64,"I expected more from this.  Don't get me wrong, it is a great bodice ripper, but it is missing something that serials from PBS, HBO and Showtime have.  I can't quite put my finger on it.

The scenes are beautiful.  Most of the fabrics seem to fit.  The actors are fine to look at, they perform their scenes pretty well.  But somehow it lacks something.  I would forget from one night to the next what we'd been watching the night before.  That said, if there is a season 2 I will watch it.  And hope for less gratuitous sex, birthing of babies onscreen and such.

It would be grand if it actually told the truth historically but I guess that's too much to hope for.",1426636800,,665,4.248

What an era!  And even when I knew who would die or be killed or have a girl baby I was caught up in the tension.  I very much enjoyed and would recommend it to anyone even remotely aware of the War of the Roses.,1426636800,,387,4.052631578947368
6746750,3,B00OGL6S64,"Well, there seems to be a growing trend to capitalizing on the naughty-to-really-bad British Royalty and their doings in and out of bed. This series makes use of all the essential items - nude bodies, graphic simulated sex, some factual history, really bitchy mothers and daughters, etc. They DO skip some of the better known facts (Richard III does not have curvature of the spine. Indeed, he looks like he spends a goodly amount of time at the gym). However, when all is said and done, this is a somewhat entertaining series.

6746788,3,B00OGL6S64,"Probably 2.5 actually. If you go for these historical dramas, this is not a bad one, but I thought the last episode was very lame and brought my rating down. It's a slightly above romanced account of the period of the 30 years war that led to the coming of Henry VIII. There are some very interesting characters, lots of trickery, but the drama seems to move in fits and starts.",1426636800,,378,4.338028169014085

I started watching this show by myself, but my wife joined in at Episode 2 - we were hooked.  Very surprised by how good it was.  Starz original programming just gets better and better (of course, BBC had a little to do with it as well..).  Two thumbs up!  Joe Bob says ""Check it out!""",1426636800,,427,4.0843373493975905

If you saw the Tudors, you are already well versed on the sometimes violent and over active hormonal scenes which, frankly, I felt was a bit much.

6746818,4,B00OGL6S64,"I did enjoy this series, but it does move at such a brisk pace that character development suffers. Elizabeth never seems to evolve very much from being dependent on her mother to being paranoid (understandably so) in court. She and Edward don't seem to age at all, even though she bears several children and he's off fighting wars. One thing I took away from this was a wonderment that anyone would want to sit on that throne, since it seems to do nothing but invite trouble. Very enjoyable overall, though, with good acting and plenty of beautiful historical details, and all the twists and turns history provides.",1426636800,,615,4.757009345794392

It took me awhile to figure out all the characters but once you did, it makes you realize that politics has not changed much through the ages.  It depicts very well the strong women of that time and what they had to go through.  They had little choices.  I would recommend this especially if you like historical fiction.",1426636800,,428,4.234567901234568

6746878,3,B00OGL6S64,It's difficult to grasp the situation growing up in a democratic voting society and no royalty.  It forces one to feed off the encyclopedia to keep up. That's a good thing,1426464000,,171,4.516129032258065
6746879,4,B00OGL6S64,"When learning about England and their kings and queens, Im often overwhelmed about how vicious, greedy, vindictive, immoral, and conniving these royals were about their family dynasties. The crown seemed to be the focal point of life, and killing, clawing, and stealing to sit upon the monarchs chair and wear the jewels made monsters out of most of them. Loyalties shifted like the weather, and to keep ones head, you either went with the flow or paid the price of treason.  Of course, every faction could be praying to God at the same battle for victory, believing they were the chosen and only one anointed to rule. However, you never really get to know what God thinks about it all.

The White Queen is another entertaining look into one portion of history, which made me grab for my reference book regarding the real story of kings and queens in England. The series is a great binge watch for anyone who wants to get swept away into the world of dukes, earls, princes, kings, and queens. It contains just the right amount of intrigue to keep audiences tuning in to the next episode.

As far as the cast, they do a plausible and fairly convincing job in their roles.  Every time I see James Frain play another scoundrel in the realm of royalty, I find him convincingly irritating to say the least. Of course, he usually loses his life in one way or the other.

All in all, the series is good. I don't think it is as well as The Tudors, but its right up there with it.  Id give the show four crowns rather than four stars.",1426464000,2,1525,4.467625899280575

6746922,4,B00OGL6S64,"This is an impressive adaptation of Philippa Gregory's novels: ""The White Queen, The Red Queen"", and ""The Kingmaker's Daughter"". It is true to the books and captures the spirit of Gregory's writing. The series is well cast for the most part, especially the actress playing the central character, Elizabeth Woodville. The series offers fascinating and dramatic storylines based on real historical events of 15th century Britain and the War of the Roses. It is also aesthetically beautiful.

6746975,3,B00OGL6S64,"As a period costume drama it's about average.
It is a very condensed (and some would say highly biased) history of The War of the Roses.
I wouldn't bother to buy the series (was watching it for free on my prime trial)because it isn't something that I would care to watch a second time.

Problems I had with it:
As a costume geek, I have to groan about the liberties taken. Hey, I know it's on a budget, and I know that they aren't striving for 100% (or even 85%) accuracy, but ...ok. If I look at it the say way as I approach say, The Tudors or The Borgias I can swallow it.

The way the time compacts and expands throughout the series is something that bothered me.

You can spot some of the obviously modern day features in the sets & backgrounds (I'm nitpicky).

Total disregard for the fact that Richard III (who is featured in this series as the love interest and husband of Ann(e) Neville) has a severe case of scoliosis--but hey, it's a costume drama, and they want the sexy side of drama not the more human side I guess.

The good points:

The acting was fine. No Oscar winning work but good enough.

The comic geek in me I found it funny that several of the episodes were written by Emma Frost. ;)",1426118400,,1206,4.240174672489083

6747044,5,B00OGL6S64,"The books are fantastic and this adaptation was phenomenal: they way the three books were combined in the series was seamless.  The plot, based on the combination of the three novels by P Gregory, and the dialogues were great; the acting is top, and the photography looked almost like Vermeer paintings with careful placing of lights and wonderful environmental props.  The only thing I found disturbing was the apparent lack of ageing of the characters but one has to remember they married as teenagers and when their children are marrying they would have been maybe 35 years old. However, some change in their looks would have been more appropriate.  Otherwise this is a MUST watch and great adaptation of the books.",1426032000,,718,4.917355371900826

I found the plot a bit lacking in substance and historical accuracy, however I did find the behind the scenes comings and goings of the Royal family and their court entertaiing.  I fell that my rarting may have been higher had the relationship of the ""White Queen"" and her lover been a bit more realistic.  I mean meeting at a farm house in the middle of the country side?  Really?  Granted none of us were  there and there was no such thing as CNN at the time so who really knows what went on relative to that particular relationship but I found that particular aspect of the story just a bit too Hollywood for my taste.",1425945600,,643,4.406779661016949

6747129,4,B00OGL6S64,"I started off thinking that season 1 was a definite 5 star show. It had good characters and a great story line. The acting and sets and costumes were well done. But man... pacing. The pacing on this show is bipolar. It focuses on a day and then it's years later. I'd go further into it but I don't want to spoil it for anyone. The other thing is it becomes a really lame drama. At times it made me want to hang myself. I literally had to do something while I watched it to keep from screaming.

So right now you're probably like, Okaaaay, then why 4 stars? Great question. In the end, the good outweighs the bad. There were only like three episodes that made me want to kill myself. The rest of the time it was a pretty great show. I think they could have stretched some of the storyline out and saved some of what went on in this season for next but that said, now that they've reached this seemingly dramatic conclusion, I am curious about what they could possibly have up their sleeves for next season.",1425945600,,1005,4.234375
6747130,5,B00OGL6S64,Very well done! But If you don`t know a little English History you can find yourself totally confused at times. It would help if some of the events were foot noted. I hope they will continue with this story!,1425945600,,207,4.333333333333333

6747164,5,B00OGL6S64,"This is my third time through this series. OK, so it features a zipper or two in the opener (boy, did costumes fix That fast!) and only the old women wear headpieces (perhaps with all the headpieces and hats we wouldn't know which actor is which?). These are problems of a 21st century production for a 21st century audience of a story over 500 years old, and What a Story It Is! These actors bring depth, complexity and humanity to characters that may have, up to now, only appeared in a chapel's stained glass windows or the face of a playing card. The producers also seemed to care that the actors resembled the characters to the extent that we know. Having read the three books the season's based upon may have given me an edge, but the dialogue keeps the viewer well informed as to who is who. Sets and costumes are outstanding (except for a few minor historical glitches). And King Edward's horse -- don't get me started on The Horse! What a scene stealer he is, and I think he knows it!",1425945600,,993,4.4021739130434785

6747224,4,B00OGL6S64,"Considering this series moves through historic events with great speed, this production of Edward IV rise to power is well produced, directed, and written.  The acting is top notch with special kudos to David Oakes as Edward's treacherous brother George and Aneurin Barnard as Richard his loyal brother, later King Richard III.  David Oakes is always wonderful, especially when he's a bit sleazy, power hungry, and just not quite smart enough to get what he wants (note his role as Juan in The Borgia's).  Janet McTeer as Lady Rivers is amazing.  Rebecca Ferguson as the White Queen, perfect. Can't forget James Frain as the Kingmaker.  The list of accomplished actors in this series is endless.  Although I must admit I'm still wondering if Max Irons is really right for the part of Edward IV.  All in all, this series is fun to watch but I do wish they had taken more time to tell the tale, its such a good story.",1425945600,,915,4.645962732919255

6747347,2,B00OGL6S64,"As someone who is very familiar with the Wars of the Roses and has read a lot about it, both fact and fiction, I found this series extremely weak. Even without reference to historical accuracy and judging it on its own merits - for writing, acting, drama, and production values - it doesn't make the grade. (For what it's worth, I've only skimmed the book and was not very impressed.)

First, the historical inaccuracies. A number of reviewers have commented on anachronisms like zippers and drainpipes, but that bothers me less than taking a period that is crammed with genuine drama and deciding to invent stuff - like having Edward IV personally stab a guy who brings him intelligence of enemy activity. Huh? Never happened - and anyway, that was not Edward's style at all.

Second, the focus on witchcraft - it didn't add anything as far as I'm concerned, and detracted from the idea that Elizabeth was in control of her own destiny. And I must say I think Ms. Gregory should have given credit to Rosemary Hawley Jarman's novel We Speak No Treason, written in 1970 or so, which is much better written than The White Queen and went into all that witchcraft stuff, including the Woodvilles' supposed descent from Melusine.

Third, the cheapness. Seems to me the BBC really pinched pennies on this series. I'm puzzled by reviewers' comments about gorgeous costumes and scenery, because I was struck instead by the thinly populated court scenes, the plainness of the costumes, the way (as someone noted) Edward IV appears several times in the same drab-colored doublet, and the use of chain mail instead of plate armor, which is what they wore in this period (but I guess the producers thought chain mail was sexier, not to mention probably cheaper to reproduce). I watched only a few minutes of The Tudors because I was so put off by the miscasting of Jonathan Rhys-Myers as Henry VIII, but I saw enough to appreciate the beautiful settings and costumes, much more sumptuous and more historically accurate than those in The White Queen.

Fourth, the sex scenes. I agree with all the reviewers who found them to be entirely too much. It's interesting to me how many viewers found this an annoying distraction. Maybe programming executives should take heed and rely less on sex scenes to attract viewers and more on compelling characterization and genuine drama.

Fifth, the character of Elizabeth Woodville/her portrayal by Rebecca Ferguson. This is the weakest link in the series. In fairness, this is partly the writing - Elizabeth is too sweet and wholesome, despite the witchcraft, so she's a dull character to start with. I don't think Ferguson helped, though - she's very bland.

Sixth, the relationship between Edward and Elizabeth. Their love story is poorly developed, implausible, and lacking in dramatic tension. Elizabeth is a tease who doesn't know what she wants, and Edward is a rapist. What's appealing or romantic about that? As then, as the series continues, their relationship becomes overly sentimentalized. Vigorous sex scenes aren't enough to fill this gaping hole.

Seventh, the characters don't age. It's ridiculous. At one point, Edward, having not changed at all since episode one, tells Elizabeth, ""We're not young anymore."" (A writing tweak would have helped, changing it to ""We're not as young as we were."" But the writers couldn't even manage that degree of thought.)

As for the casting and characterization of Edward IV, I have mixed feelings. I thought the casting of Max Irons was okay, as Irons meets the bottom-line requirements of being tall and good-looking, which was by no means a given in view of casting directors' often strange decisions. And I thought he played the role decently - in the first scenes with Elizabeth, he conveys a certain cockiness and sexiness very well. One reviewer commented that Irons was too young, yet he was 26 when he played this role, and Edward IV was 22 when he married Elizabeth Woodville. The reason Irons comes across as too young, I think, is that the character in the series is underdeveloped and underwritten, so that Edward comes across more as an immature braggart than as a smart, dynamic leader.

On the plus side, there were some excellent performances - Aneurin Bevan as Richard III (one of the more complex and thus interesting characters in the series), Janet McTeer as Jacquetta Woodville, Faye Marsay as Anne Neville, and David Oakes as Clarence (Oakes definitely fits my idea of George of Clarence).

The biggest plus is that the series seems to have piqued many viewers' interest in the Wars of the Roses (not the Cousins' War, by the way - I'm pretty sure that phrase was invented by Ms. Gregory). But overall, The White Queen fails to make the most of the real drama and larger-than-life characters of this period in favor of sensationalized inventions such as witchcraft, a king who personally stabs messengers, and an incestuous uncle-niece relationship. A missed opportunity.",1425859200,3,4971,4.935406698564593

I, as usual, enjoyed the book more than watching the show but it was fun to get visual aids. The stories did have very different angles and it was interesting to see the author's personal liberties. I have previously read Philippa Gregory's books, which are the basis for the White Queen and loved those and found the show followed her books quite well. Definitely worth watching.",1425427200,,553,4.421568627450981

6747456,3,B00OGL6S64,"The White Queen suffers from what many of these other hip historical dramas do: too much sex and nudity. If I was looking for porn, this would be getting 5 stars, since you can get your story and get your rocks off, then get back to the story.  But that's not my thing. As a matter of fact, I'd love to be watching this with my daughter so that we can talk about the history and so on. Unfortunately, as the movie is, I have to spend at least 15 to 20 minutes of every episode looking away until my wife says its ok because of one of the soft porn scenes that comes on.  I've learned my limits and my weaknesses, and I really wish movie makers would ease off on feeling like they need to stoop to all that sex just to get us interested.

I'm sure the white queen would be doing fine without actually showing us Rebecca Ferguson's nipples.",1425340800,,838,4.128834355828221

I was not expecting Henry Tudor's mother being on hand immediately after King Richard was killed in the battle. And why would he immediately wear the king's crown? Also at the end, the focus on the White Queen seems to have been lost even after her seeing her other son alive, who is also an heir to the throne.

The only thing I don't care for (hence 4 stars instead of 5) is all the boob, butt, and rutting sex scenes.  Totally unnecessary and really don't add anything to the story.  I've seen quite enough of queen Elizabeth's bosom, and I'm only 5 episodes in to it.  There are other random bare bosoms here and there as well.  Enough, please!!!  But enough of that.

6747511,2,B00OGL6S64,I had super high hopes for this show. There are some great actors involved and I thought it might be Mists of Avalon meets historical fiction.

6747512,5,B00OGL6S64,"Drama, laughed, cried and wanted more.  It's a costume drama so it had me  from the get go. WARNING SPOILER ALERT.  The improbable queen is a young widow living in the country with her mother, father, a zillion brothers and sisters and of course, her two boys. After a ferocious battle (off camera) the young king, who is unquestionably, a hottie rides in with a small contingent near the home of the beautiful lady.  He is also accompanied by a lord, who adds more than his two cents, and has considerable distaste for the young women and her family  who were on the side of the vanquished king.  The new king doesn't want to hear it and he agrees to restore lands taken from his lady fair.  Did I say the widow is young, beautiful and listens to the counsel of her best-friend/mother.

The king is leaving the next morning and the young women (probably with a size 22"" waist) meets him at sunrise where he tries to bed her.  It looks more like an intended rape than love-making but the king is used to getting his way with the girls.  She grabs his knife and he says, ""it's treason to attack the king.""  She being one smart-cookie, takes the knife and puts it to her own throat and says, ""I am as brave as any man.""
 Meaning she'll really kill herself.  Well he goes off in a huff and says, he never wants to see her again.

Agony on both sides until they meet again and he asks her to marry him.  He is ""Mad"" for her.
 Mom and the priest who marries them are the only ones who witness the wedding.  The good mother arranges for a cottage where they can consumate their love, marriage and the camera taking in the nuptial bed.  After this blissful union, the king leaves and says, we must keep our union quiet for a while but my love, I will send for you.

The new queen is told by her older brother that the marriage was really a sham.  The king just wanted to bed her.  After all, it was just mom, and the priest who were the wedding witnesses.  It was a ploy to get her in bed. His advisor tells him, he must marry the Queen of France.

Racked with anxiety and fear for her future, she wants to believe her king husband but fears her brother maybe right.  There are several charming  somewhat violent episodes to find out.  I don't know if any of this is historically correct but for me, it didn't matter.",1425254400,5,2310,4.252873563218391

Scenery is beautiful. Character development is limited to the main character and her rather power hungry mother. This time in history is a time of people seizing thrones rather than coming to them through family. Besides this, I can't say much more about the series.

6747524,4,B00OGL6S64,"The story line is based on historical fact and is a very interesting take on the struggle for the English throne.  One thing that becomes obvious immediately is that people's thirst for power hasn't changed much over the last few millennia, just the method of achieving their goal.  People are dropping dead faster than a fat man eating free crab legs at an all-you-can-eat restaurant.  Perhaps the most striking feature of this series is the amount of gratuitous nudity and sex.  I'm not sure why the writers felt it necessary to show so many women topless, men's bare butts, and couples copulating.  It really adds nothing to the story line, but it does make this series akin to the soft porn of years past.",1425254400,,709,4.685483870967742

6747600,4,B00OGL6S64,"This is an extremely interesting series but so frustrating I'm not sure if I like it.  The king has been betrayed by everyone but his queen, yet forgives everyone.  Everyone treats the queen with disdain as she is not high borne, yet they blame her for the consequences of THEIR actions.  I'm a stickler for fairness and these people are beyond unfair.  I dislike everyone, even the queen who stupidly allows herself to be put in the position of being the bad guy.  I fast forward thru the unbearable parts, only to go back to see what really happened. And like an abused spouse I keep hoping the next episode will reveal some justification to remain.",1425168000,,651,4.577586206896552

6747650,5,B00OGL6S64,"Historically accurate fiction based on the lives of 3 remarkable real women and their families. The series provides insight into how the nobility of their day lived, fought, and died and the intrigue that surrounded their lives. These were brutal and tumultuous times when the future of individuals, families, and nations could depend on who produced the first son who would be rightful heir to the throne.

If you have ever wished you could have lived during the Middle Ages as a highborn nobleman or noblewoman and complain about chivalry being dead, think again. Because, after viewing this series, you might find you are counting yourself lucky to be living in the 21st Century and well removed form the time when the White Queen lived.

The romance of brave knights and fair maidens is not all that it may seem!.",1425081600,,817,4.828571428571428

Elements that are pleasing are great scenery, architecture and costumes. The dialogue is mostly very clever but there are obvious modern interjections with such words as ""I don't bully people"".

6747798,3,B00OGL6S64,"I have enjoyed the series, mostly for the historical perspective it gives. It's interesting that Shakespeare makes Richard of York a rogue, Josephine Tey makes him a misjudged, much maligned, excellent ruler, but here in the movie, Richard is portrayed as originally upright and ready to do right by the young Prince Edward, but then because of Elizabeth's lack of trust in him, he turns away from her and goes for the throne himself. I guess we can't know the ""truth"" of the matter.

The reason I am only giving this series three stars is because there seems to be a mandatory sex scene in almost every episode. It's boring. It's also the reason I can't recommend it to my daughter, even though it would be good for her to learn English history from this series otherwise. These scenes do nothing FOR the series and do a lot against it, just because they really don't add to the story line and the repetitiveness of them speaks to the lack of innovation of the screen writers--some sort of need to attract a lowly viewer who otherwise can't be drawn in?",1425081600,3,1054,4.576719576719577

There are some first class performances in this part fantasy, part drama, part historical lesson about the Yorks, who preceded the Tudors on the throne of England. If nothing else it makes one want to read up on British history and see how close it comes to what we know as a factual chronicle. The true focus is on Elizabeth, who wedded King Edward. She had at least ten children with the King of England, two of which were boys -- the same two boys which history tells us were sent to the tower and were never seen again. Did Richard do away with them? There is far too much to go into for a quick review but it's safe to say there is enough intrigue, in-fighting, out-fighting, romance, sex and - yes - even witchcraft to keep an audience's attention. Just don't look for exactitude. This is entertainments, after all. :)",1425081600,,956,4.346368715083799

6747960,2,B00OGL6S64,"It wasn't the plethora of sex scenes featuring much nudity and scarce plot points, despite the nebulous character list. I'm a fan of midevil England historical dramas. This is not historically accurate. It does raise some interesting historical questions.
Essentially, this is supposedly a retelling of the final acts of the War of the Roses from the female perspective. It depicts the male characters as indecisive and pushed to dastardly acts by the wives and mothers of royalty and nobility. It still fulfills the scheming stereotypes and sticks with the Garden of Eden apple eating notion that woman are behind the world's ills after all.
Plus the plot line that an attempted rape, halted by a suicide threat and throat cutting lead to the overall blissful love match of King Edward and Queen Elizabeth defies human nature. I just kept watching, waiting for the plot to improve or the characters to age. Neither happened.",1425081600,13,925,5.012987012987013

6748004,4,B00OGL6S64,"Good acting and beautiful historical scenery in the series. I believe it was shot in some of the historical palaces around Bruges.  I haven't read the books the series is based on, but I am a scholar in this area, and even though I don't believe in the witchcraft plot line, it does make for interesting story telling, and the plot does follow history fairly well, 60% of so. Further, though I might not buy the witchcraft plot, witchcraft was hinted at with Elizabeth Woodville's mother.
What surprised me, and pleasantly, was the acting: quite strong by all the participants. Richard III was played quite well and I was glad to see that in this story Richard did not have his nephews killed (yes, I am a Ricardian here).  The actor who portrayed the Kingmaker, and he was in ""The Tudors"" was great as usual, but the two female surprises for me in acting were the actresses who portrayed Elizabeth Woodville and Ann Neville! Both had me believing they were these women, and that is good acting!!",1425081600,,996,4.621468926553672

This needs to be on the must watch list for any film student, history buff, or a person with a mind for intrigue, betrayal, love, cut throat politics and some of the more well written and cast program I've seen in a while.

I could not get enough of the amazing actors and actresses in this mini-series.  I love reading historical romance novels and this t.v. series filled my visual void I've been seeking.  I know HBO did a series of King Henry Tudor but I would love to see this series continue.  The actors, scenes, and music was done so well.

I had to pull out a tourist guide book on the Kings of England to figure out who everyone was in relationship to each other. But it's a complicated story, so what can you expect...

6748134,4,B00OGL6S64,"The show kind of starts off slow. It took a while for the main characters to form, but once they did it was amazing.  The sex scenes are a little graphic but most of those occur in the first 3 episodes.  After that they are few and far between.  The story line did become a little hard to follow as it went on.  Mostly because they skipped several years at a time. The few complaints that I have are that Edward did not age at all.  He looked the same, maybe a wee bit chubbier, when he died as when you first see him in Episode 1. In one scene it was him and his children eating together.  He looked the same age as his older daughters. If you are a history buff please do not watch this expecting to see a accurate historical reenactment. It's not.  Not even a little bit. Zippers, modern duct work, rubber  boots, etc.  It drove me bananas but overall this was an great show.",1424736000,,878,4.117647058823529

Rebecca Ferguson was a good choice for Elizabeth Woodville, Old enough to be believable in the role yet young and beautiful enough to attract the young King Edward.

It's pretty good following historical events beginning with the young Edward and Elizabeth Grey's romance and ending with the rise of Richard III. Rather than focus on the men, the novelist focuses on the women who control the men, giving the story line some very interesting  slants. I like English history, especially when the nasty backstairs plots are dealt with at length There is a lot of passionate sex and bare butts. Good sets. Competent actors.

6748295,4,B00OGL6S64,"As a huge Phillipa Gregory fan, I was excited to discover amazon offers this series on Prime Instant Video. The main character, Queen Elizabeth Woodville, played by Rebecca Ferguson, somehow goes from being a commoner to marrying a Prince of England. What is miraculous about this situation is that it actually happened hundreds of years ago.

What I think sets this series apart from others is it is told from woman's point of view, unlike the mostly male-driven movies and TV shows common these days. Women will be able to relate to the three main characters: Elizabeth Woodville, Anne Neville, and Margaret Beaufort.

If you are not a history buff, this series may not appeal to you, as it is heavier on historical accuracy and less so on soapy drama.",1424476800,,754,4.792307692307692

Lots of scandals, beheadings, alliances, lavish costumes, authentic settings and a touch of magic.

6748369,3,B00OGL6S64,"What is the difference between historical fiction and historical romance? Historical fiction used to involve a created character placed in a realistic setting that had been the subject of great research and then expanded to include fictional renditions of the private life, conversation and inner thoughts of a real person in a real historical setting. .And this movement often gives rise to considerable liberties taken from the historic record in favor of telling a good tale, rather than a factual one.  Historical romance has its heart, not in the history of the past but in the love story that happens to be set there.

Philippa Gregory is a serious researcher. She is also a feminist who likes to focus on female characters in an age when men had all the overt power and women had only their wiles. Gregory has not only the historian's craft, but also the story tellers gift. Being an author who deals with women in times past, she inevitably deals with romance--the activity rather than the genre if you will--in a major way. This makes it a little harder to place where the book behind the series lies on the continuum from one genre to the other.  And not having read it, I'm not aware how close the series hues to the book.

I found the series to be highly entertaining, hence its stars and the episodes to both catch my interest and fly by. I also found the portrayal of the story to be sensationalized--not only in the Starz' versions more explicit sex than the BBC's, but in its emphasis on witchcraft and religious fanaticism as well. Margaret Beaufort for example is portrayed as ludicrously fanatical; it's hard to take her seriously. Yet I imagine that a woman who could manage her estate in the detail she personally did and be the respected founder of two formidable colleges had more to her than one gathers here. I personally hate to be misdirected historically in the name of heightening entertainment value or allure.

I learned a lot of historical facts I was never quite interested enough to try to sort out about lineage and alignment in the war of the cousins, or the war of the roses if you will, from watching this series. But I am not so sure I learned a great deal about the real people at the heart of this story, nor--and this is perhaps the more important point in literature than history--about the truths of human experience, .I did, however, quite enjoy the sheer entertainment this series offered up to me..",1424476800,3,2445,4.676744186046512

6748387,4,B00OGL6S64,"For those who revel in anything 'Tudor' this should be a required prequel to anything Henry VIII. The Tudors were the unlikely 'winners' in the war of the Roses...the House of Lancaster vs. the house of York. Edward IV who unseated the unstable Henry VI  a Lancastrian king,  was himself unseated by the notorious Richard III, his own brother who grabbed the throne after Edward's death. Edward's two sons, 'the Princes in the Tower' , his natural heirs disappeared and RIchard himself was killed at Bosworth to see Henry Tudor claim the throne of England. The White Queen is the story of the love affair of Edward IV, his rivalry with his two brothers, Richard and George, the plotting of Henry Tudor's mother Lady Beaufort to maneuver her son to the throne and the intrigue abounding in court life of the 15th century.

There is sterling performances by the main players; Edward, in his virile youth, Elizabeth his commoner wife, her mother Jacquetta and Lord Warrick, the 'kingmaker' who disapproves of Edwards choice of wife. There are also good performances by the daughters of Warrick who become wives to George and Richard, the brothers of Edward. It is an excellent series. Series I ends with the victory of Henry Tudor(father of Henry VIII) at Bosworth, and the death of Richard III, the scheming brother of Edward.",1424476800,,1324,4.849557522123894

It was refreshing in that it covered the input (with a little artistic licence no doubt) of the three major matriarchs in the War Of The Roses.  A woman's eye view of the formation of Tudor England.  England's history is full of strong women, from Boadicea/Boudicca to Margaret Thatcher.
Well acted and with some beautiful locations.  A few people mention some 'bloopers' like metal stair rails etc but, who cares?  It was entertaining and was captivating enough to be able to ignore what probably 90% of people would not notice anyway.

Edward's marriage to the White Queen, Elizabeth, was very controversial because she was not of very high station. Because of this her life was constantly being undermined and in danger.

Her children are the legendary princes' in the Tower of London that King Richard III, Edward's brother, imprisoned and probably murdered.  Lady Grey's daughters became the mothers or wives of nearly all the Tudor kings that came after the last Plantagenet, Richard III.  A fascinating study in the greed and entitlement of the kings and queens of the time.  Lady Grey did not share their avarice but become enmeshed by having nearly ten children by Edward and having a near masterful sense of survival for her and her children.",1424390400,,616,4.894230769230769

I was fascinated to see the stories of Elizabeth Woodville and Edward IV. The sheer scope of their dramas included all of England and parts of France, Scotland, and Ireland. The distances travelled and the money spent was mind-boggling. The focus, ambition and power of the ruling class was hard to accept and hard to comprehend.

6748700,4,B00OGL6S64,"I felt the first episode moved a bit too fast to appreciate the developing relationships (I won't spoil the plot). Later in the series, a few things take a turn for the worse, which left me feeling that this was turning into a Medieval take off of the first Hunger Games. Well, I'm exaggerating a little but I was hoping some of the characters would be more permanent in the series as they were characters you grow to like.

Rebecca Furguson's acting role as queen is just as superb as her beauty. Some of the more sinister character's parts are also played very well. Thus, there's an excellent balance of good and evil that can swing either way in an episode. The scenery is breathtaking, the acting excellent, character development better than usual, and there's no loss for romance. There is nudity, however, so you might want to chase the children out of the room.

Overall, this has become a series I very much enjoy watching.",1424390400,,932,4.608433734939759

The settings and costumes are excellent, and the acting, while suitably big, is fine too. Battle scenes are brief and not excessively gory. The characters are solid and consistent, if not subtle. An outstanding character is Lady Margaret Beaufort (played by Amanda Hale), who, with shifting eyes and oral tics, appears tricky as a fox and crazy as a bedbug. The story line is hard to follow unless you are a student of the Wars of the Roses, as every side has people named Richard, Henry, Edward, and Elizabeth, and the crown changes hands as often as a hockey puck. Apparently that's what really went on in the 15th century, but there's no need to worry about the details; just go along with it and enjoy.",1424390400,,798,4.626760563380282

6748818,5,B00OGL6S64,"I loved it! I find my knowledge of this period of English history woefully lacking as I never took european history in college. I have now become quite fanatical and have read everything on the War of the T=roses because of this series.
I thought the casting was quite fantastic. Others have commented on the casting of King Edward as being too young. However, i reviewed documents that reveal he was in his teens and named the ""boy king."" Also he spent quite a bit of time warring and gaming so his muscles were in keeping with this and it is also noted he was quite handsome and large (6^'4) for the times, so Max Irons perfectly fits the bill. Plus, the chemistry between Elizabeth Woodwille and King Edward is smoking HOT so who am i to complain!!!! SMOKING!

I loved the costumes, and the settings in Bruges which looks like  medieval village still. I especially loved the casting of actors especially as i had never seen any before. Thank goodness, a Keira Knightly or Julia Roberts or Gwneth Paltrow didn't appear! It would have broken by complete immersion into the series. I honestly have never felt while wtching a move that I was actually seeing the real people living their lives on film. Tahts how elastic it was!
LOVE LOVE
my only complaint --the abrupt end! I was stunned. It seems to me if something has a  called Series 1 that a Series 2 follows. What gives?
I hear the British audiences mocked the show which may have scrapped the plans for a Series 2. Maybe the British  didn't like the criticism leveled at the whole King/Queen thing or the way their ancestors were portrayed like a current day IS IS  . Maybe hits a little close to home. Americans will have no such complaints. We can watch with utter fascination. (While thanking goodness Thomas Jefferson and George /Washington saved us form this bloody mess of picking leaders) :)",1424390400,3,1854,4.606060606060606

6749034,3,B00OGL6S64,"This is based on a historical figure, who really did suffer a lot of ups and downs.  I like the way the lead and her mother are portrayed as really having believed in and practiced the Dark Arts of which they were accused.  The White Queen's king is too young for his role, but most of the supporting cast is great!",1424390400,,315,4.147540983606557

6749053,5,B00OGL6S64,"I was interested in this series, but held off watching it because of poor reviews from BBC viewers.  The series was a pleasant surprise - the plot, script, and especially acting were very good.  In fact, I was so wrapped up in the plot and wonderful actors that I never noticed clothing zippers, handicap rails on building, or anything like that.  But seriously, can you imagine trying to manage a large production like this and build a custom set, and finely comb all details such as making sure zippers aren't visible - ridiculous!  Looking over a few of the reviews again I noticed that quite a few seemed like malicious jabs at Max Irons and I am not entirely sure why except that a few also mentioned his dad, Jeremy Irons.  It was implied that the actors who played his brothers performed better, but I disagree.  Aneurin Barnard, who I believe is very good actor, did not impress me as much as Max Irons.  Aneurin was melancholy throughout, but it only fit with his character's situation in some of the later episodes.  King Edward was believable in each situation throughout the series, as was George.  Jacquetta, Lady Cecily, Lady Anne, Lady Margaret (so convincing!) were amazing.  Don't be discouraged from watching this series by the BBC viewers.  A+ acting in The White Queen - a hell of a lot better than any of the absolutely terrible acting that I have seen on the BBC!",1424390400,,1385,4.635245901639344

The story, like all Brit historical films, sucks you in fast (beats me why. They just do that). I wish they had made The White Princess miniseries they had planned. Freya Mavor is fantastic as Princess Elizabethwould love to have seen her in that second miniseries to help gain closure to The White Queen. Ep 10... well no spoilers here. You'll have to see it for yourself. Just be ready for your guts to be ripped out.

6749108,2,B00OGL6S64,"Maybe its just me, but this show simply gets on my nerves. Production value is lacking, and it pales in comparison to previous shows of the same genera such as ""Tudors"". Many of the actors are all recycled from other Starz/Showtime shows and to be quite frank they were better in those other shows than they are here. I made it through the two episodes (barely), but simply could not expose my brain to another story of how another Victorian queen came into power through the lustful desires of a king and yada yada yada ... yes you have heard it all before.

I know that the book didn't really go into her marriage/life with Earl Grey, but I believe having known more about that lot of time would have helped me decide whether I actually liked her or not (I'm still on the fence).  She seemed like a great mum and a passionate and loving wife, but she was hated by so many and I wanted to see more reasons as to why she was hated, other than her being the wife/queen of the alleged usurper.

6749279,5,B00OGL6S64,We just joined Amazon Prime and the first show I watched was The White Queen.  I love Phillippa Gregory books.  Love that there is a TV series made from her stories.

6749284,4,B00OGL6S64,"Keep in mind that Phillippa Gregory wrote these books as historical interpretation and fiction, so if you are looking for a documentary, this is not going to be it, but it is pretty close! Both this film adaptation and the books it is based on are well researched. Phillippa Gregory has a passion and knack for keeping true to the essence of the historical figures she chooses to write about, and her theories of their motives are always well researched and fascinating.
I love this series (both the books and the television adaptations) because it explores these incredible women who truly did propel and forge the dynasties we know throughout English history, delving into their motives, triumphs, sorrows, and exploring the possibilities.
I enjoyed the beautiful costuming, gorgeous sets, fascinating acting and above all, perspective and challenges brought to life.
Well done!",1424390400,,880,5.204225352112676
6749285,5,B00OGL6S64,Loved it.  Read all three books that this series was made from and thought the series did a great job combining the three books and telling the story from the perspective of the three different woman.  It was seeing a condensed version of the three books but having read the books ahead of time it was easy for me to fill in a few blanks.  I did enjoy the series.,1424390400,,363,4.1571428571428575

6749292,2,B00OGL6S64,"The White Queen has the appearance of a really exciting period piece. The history of the Wars of the Roses is full of enough drama, intrigue, and power dynamics to make a really exciting and fun show. I had high hopes for the representations of Elizabeth Woodville, Margaret Beaufort, and Anne Neville as powerful female figures working behind the scenes of the male-dominated political landscape. Keeping in mind that I have not read the source material by Phillipa Gregory, the depiction of female characters in this television adaptation was disappointing. I thought the series was really on to something in the first episode or two, but then Woodville was reduced to a witch, Beaufort a crazed religious zealot, and Neville an embittered former pawn of everyone in power above her. At some point, the series began to feel as though the show was mansplaining the real reasons why a woman would have had any power or agency during the 15th century. Argh. Finally, I could not deal with the ridiculous portrayal of Elizabeth of York as a successor to her mother's witchcraft who falls in love with Richard III. NO! NO! NO! NO! NO!",1424390400,4,1131,4.835051546391752

My only reason for leaving this review is to lower its average rating because I can't get invested in period pieces, all these people are already dead and I just don't care. Also, I'm horribly bias and bigoted towards anything that even smells of aristocracy and monarchy, I just despise the entire concept and refuse to propagate their popularity, I never would have reviewed this in the first place, but Amazon keeps emailing me and I'm mildly inebriated.",1424390400,2,560,4.724489795918367

The perspective is nice in showing the roll women in elite families. They were the glue that held empires and allies together. However the stress on magic as if it changed world affairs was overdone.  Good for a historical piece that fits somewhere between the known and fiction,1424304000,,445,4.6923076923076925

6749570,3,B00OGL6S64,"Both pros and cons about this series.

The pros include both well written scenes and actors committed to the quality of the writing.

What seemed cheesy to me were the inauthentic period costumes with their lack of period detail, period ornamentation and more modern finishes... did I see a zipper on a dress worn by Queen Elizabeth?

And with the story line placed in the middle ages, I certainly expected more squalor and less pristine architecture. C'mon people, keeping filth and disease at bay was the order of the day -- which is one of the reasons a large part of the population were cowed into believing the church was all-powerful.

Last, in one of the reviews someone mentioned there were separate versions released -- for UK and US audiences -- with the US version having more sexual content. I for one would have preferred seeing fewer naked backsides and bare breasted women. Some of these scenes felt like they were lifted from a set in Casterly Rock. And Ms. Gregory certainly didn't include that level of detail in her writing.",1424131200,3,1043,4.745856353591161

6749572,5,B00OGL6S64,"a superb period costume drama that takes many artistic and historical liberties by leaps and bounds but that's what makes it so much fun.

The actors are first rate all the way and my favorite is the Duchess Cecily. She's an absolute scream; the epitome of the mother-in-law from the darkest regions of hell from whom even the devil himself would run. The woman looks like an evil alien from Mars.
She's like a walking, talking, breathing ""cold spot"" that paranormal investigators are always looking for; well look no further.

And then there's the Lady (Anne) Neville; oh yeah, here's another piece of work. She sees signs and visions and has God on her speed dial LOL!!!
Every lousy daybreak is a sign from The Almighty;  Ingmar Bergman's got nothin' on this one. Man, after awhile it's like, honey you should seriously chill; I wonder what they used for tranquilizers in those days; she definitely could have used some modern meds, that's for sure, but I'm not certain how effective meds are for seriously delusional religious zealots.

There are actors you will recognize from ""The Tudors"" who are wonderfully gifted actors and so convincing in their roles.

The costumes and jewels are way over the top for that time period, but who cares, it just adds to the visually delightful ambiance of life at court; murder, mayhem, back stabbing, scheming, beheadings and a fair amount of good 'ole fashion witch craft; folks really ran amuck in those days playing musical thrones, back and forth they go; it's a blast.

For those who prefer a more accurate depiction of how life used to be back in the day, they should watch ""The Lion in Winter"" with Peter O'Toole and Katherine Hepburn running around in soiled rags while they floor the audience with some of the most brilliant dialogue ever conceived.
Unfortunately, there isn't anybody today (IMHO) who can touch either of those legendary actors.

English history was never presented to this degree of resplendent glamour but unless you want to watch a tiresome and snoring boring old film like Richard III with Olivier (God, how many times was I subjected to that horror in high school), then watch these newer iterations of the classics and be truly entertained. lotsa pretty people too of course -:)",1424131200,10,2252,4.848958333333333
6749573,5,B00OGL6S64,"I have read Phillipa Gregory's stories, gobbling them up one after another. They satisfy my period history addiction with the bonus of a touch of the authors theories behind the history. I thoroughly enjoyed every one that I have read. That being said, I l loved every episode of The White Queen. I thought all of the characters were brilliantly done, and enjoyed the actors visions of them. The entire series follows the stories it is based on pretty closely. There are always variations to a story when it is made to film, but I didn't feel there was too much happening away from the written stories.  I watched one episode a night and then grieved a little when it was over. Worth watching! I would love to see more of her books into film.",1423958400,,742,4.496296296296296

I think the acting was superb and the choice of actors and the chemistry was amazing.  The more interesting thing of all is that the history of this period and the events are true to facts.  I have to say that I saw some comments about the war being won by men however, the clandestine nature of war can not be ignored.  This was in interesting and captivating series and I am just disappointed that it ends.  I am looking forward to the White Princesses.  I loved the Richard III actor.

Everything about the Tudor's; the writing, acting, costumes were so amazing as were the men.  Everything was vivid and impressive, but then then the life of Henry VIII in itself was historically infamously intriguing to us before we started watching the Tudor's.

I was very excited to see that it was done in collaboration with the BBC because that guaranteed great costuming, and boy was it. Now you must put aside almost all your notions of historical accuracy but that is fine because this series was based on a fictional novel not on historical perfection. There is a lot of back stabbing and plotting which some may say is too negative;  but let us be realistic; that is how things really were in those times. Wonderful actors and actresses, beautiful costumes, breath taking locations, bold and bloody fight seens, hot romance and intrigue what more could you ask for.

6749590,4,B00OGL6S64,"**Edited to add:  Finished the series and it really grew on me as it continued - changed the rating to four stars after all [there were somewhat fewer TV-MA scenes as it went on, as well].  As an adaptation of Phillipa Gregory's versions of these characters and time period, it was very well done.  The particular spin that Gregory put on the characters is accurately shown in this show.  I'm not sure how it would come across to someone who hasn't read the books, or at least one of them, but they've done a great job with the material in this production.  The casting is what really makes it reach its potential.  I've seen the movie made from Gregory's book ""The Other Boleyn Girl,"" and this production is a far superior adaptation in all aspects.

This part of English history can be pretty confusing to follow, with all the tangled up family trees involved, but this series manages to pretty much make it easy to figure out who is who.  Henry Tudor's claim to the throne is hard to understand in the show, but that's because it's hard to understand in the actual history, too; his nearest link to any royal blood came from a French Queen who was the widow of an English King - not exactly making him a shoe-in for the English throne.  His other royal lineage did come from English royalty, but not a direct one and the ancestor from which it came was born out of wedlock. It is an amazingly complicated progression of events that led up to the end of the War of the Roses, so if you feel confused watching this show, that's to be expected, but it doesn't take too much reading to get a grasp of it, if you are interested enough to pursue it.  It's easy for me to like a show like this because I really enjoy English history of this time period; it's fun to imagine the personalities of the real people involved, which is where Gregory's contribution comes in, to create, from names & dates, characters with virtues and vices that make them seem more real.

Original text:
I've only watched one and a half episodes so far, and it's one of those - I should say ANOTHER one of those - shows that would be very watchable were it not for the excessive number of fairly graphic sex scenes.  I've read several of Phillipa Gregory's books, so I know better than to expect true historical accuracy, and don't mind that too much; she writes a good story even if it's stretching and scrambling the truth.

The casting is excellent, costumes and sets are visually pleasing [I loved how they had Elizabeth Woodville in the same plain dress day after day at first - that's how it was for the regular folks in those days], and it's just enjoyable to watch...until about the third time you have to see the main characters grinding away in bed.  I'd have given it 4 stars if not the for all that.  It's sad that Hollywood doesn't think they can interest an audience with just excellent casting and good production.",1423440000,4,2902,4.449056603773585

So now I am intrigued because Elizabeth Woodville was a fascinating person and kind of a hub for alot of intriguing English history.  Point of detail -the leaping horn on the side saddle is an 1800s development. Elizabeth would have been riding a pillion side saddle with no horn, just a platform for both feet on one side I think.

6749593,4,B00OGL6S64,"Having read all three novels on which the series is based, and also knowing some basic history of the period, there were no surprises here.  But that's not why a person watches a historical drama is it?

The writers did a very nice job of blending Philippa Gregory's three separate threads into a single series, and the most commendable writing and acting created a Margaret Beaufort I didn't hate.  Her character was much more human than she appeared in any of the novels--still delusional and sanctimonious, but somehow sympathetic.

I read Gregory's novels as a user-friendly way to get a basic historical background on a period before plunging into what always seem to be dry and dusty factual sources, and this series would also serve that purpose.

6749595,5,B00OGL6S64,"I am a British history buff, but mainly from the Tudor dynasty, onwards. This series, though it takes dramatic license, does a splendid job breaking down the Wars of the Roses. It is addictive and makes you want to go brush up on that period. It was rather enjoyable to watch the evolution of the characters. For example, Richard, by his makeup and bearing over the course of the episodes, starts out as fresh and friendly youth but eventually comes to resemble the wretched Richard III of legend.

6749606,2,B00OGL6S64,"Not having read the book, I don't know if it's the book or the TV adaptation that is to blame. But what starts out as a strong drama quickly appears to run out of ideas for plot and character developments in the last episodes. The political intrigues, especially after the death of Edward IV are ham-fisted and transparently crude to the point of being laughable. And character development is largely implausible and clearly written mainly to fit the general historical context of events rather than making any sense. The central literary conceit, of making women the central characters in the story of the War of the Roses, starts out strong, but it seems clear the author's talents were not quite up to the task, especially toward the end.

Which kind of sums up the whole effort; a good try, but not quite up to snuff.",1422835200,3,821,4.662068965517242

It's hard to follow if one is not intricately familiar with that very complex historical period. And reportedly, this is not an accurate representation. Overall it's not a bad costume drama, unfortunately wooden dialogue depicts too many marital machinations, ie, since you are my fifth cousin twice removed and my Uncle's godfather, we cannot conspire together in marriage against such and such a horrible foreign regime, blah, blah. While the era was surely replete with such politics, it could have been more subtly or artfully done.

I like how the writer portrays the female leads as strong and determined for a change.

The quality of the stream is top notch compared to others on prime. It really is A grade. Noise levels are low, there is almost no banding issues.

6749630,5,B00OGL6S64,"This was quite entertaining. As others have mentioned the first couple of episodes are slow compared to the rest of the season. But the time lapses and drama there-after are riveting. I have read a couple of Philippa Gregory's novels and always find them to be historically on-point, to a degree.

In this series she brings the women to the forefront and explores theories not always recognized by 'common history'. Characters such as Richard III are more romanticized than the accepted history. For instance, we know based on Richard's bones he had sever scoliosis, something not demonstrated in the show. It is theorized Richard, a Prince of the tower and Edward IV son survived, and that too is brought into the fold. Margaret Beaufort's role is quite dramatized based on theories, but the story unfolds so well you can't help but be enthralled.

The White Queen leaves the watcher yearning for more information, posing questions about the historical accuracy and the sources of Philippa's information. It is not to say the show is 100% historically accurate , but instead a demonstration of what could have transpired during the Cousins' War  and the roles these influential women played.

Well, since that name wasn't in the title I had no idea it had already been done. So imagine how happy I was to see this! I love the idea of showing history through a woman's perspective. I am not at all bothered by the changes that the writers took- and I tend to be a stickler for history. The story is good enough to make me not care. And there is a lot that would have to be filled in anyway, so one guess is as good as another in some areas.

I loved the acting, the cast, the writing, the costumes, the sets, everything. I don't see a need for nudity or sex scenes that exist only for the purpose of nudity and sex, but this series had a lot less of that than HBO so that was okay too. I thought it was well done. The writing really helped me to understand how family members could be so ruthless and blood thirsty. Fear, ambition, loveless political marriages, superstition, popularity, and power really wreaked havoc with people's lives. Very interesting story.

6749701,4,B00OGL6S64,"My problem with programs like this is that a lot of people think they are true. In a broad sense, they are. The details? Not so much.

Having said that, I liked The White Queen and applaud telling the story from the point of view of women. I said to myself as soon as I saw Margaret Beaufort ""she was a force of nature"" - and she was. Not knowing much about Elizabeth Woodville or Ann Neville, who knows how well they were drawn. I liked the mystery surrounding the Princes in the Tower - except that this program goes way out of its way to suggest the younger (Richard) is spirited away and survives, then does nothing with this historical bombshell. King Richard's dalliance with his niece, Princess Elizabeth (Henry Tudor's future wife) was kind of laughable, but I guess it made sense in terms of the way both parties explained why they participated. I liked Jacquetta Woodville immensely, and was very sad for her daughter Queen Elizabeth when she dies, because the Queen lost her best friend and advisor.",1415923200,,1010,4.580110497237569

6749705,2,B00OGL6S64,"As a junkie of medieval English history, I enjoyed this dramatization of some of the aspects of the Wars of the Roses.  It played a little free and loose with actual history, but not too badly -- was closer to real events than many of the episodes of ""The Tudors,"" for example.  But not nearly as well cast, written, or acted.  Jeremy Irons' son was totally miscast as Edward IV -- came off more like a college athletic jock or frat boy than as the brilliant, ruthless, dominating, yet charismatic character the historical Edward was.  The young actor who played Richard III portrayed him as a nice, likable guy whom events controlled rather than the other way around -- which history tells us was not the case (read Alison Weir's ""The Princes in the Tower"" for a more accurate exposition of his character and activities).  On the other hand, James Frain was superb as ""the kingmaker,"" and the actress who played Jacquetta stole every scene she was in.  Bottom line: worth seeing, but came up far short in comparison to the other recent period series, ""The Tudors,"" which was brilliantly cast, written, and acted, even though it took even more liberties with actual history.",1415404800,,1174,4.730392156862745

6749730,3,B00OGL6S64,"I am reviewing this with still 2 more episodes remaining. I am growing weary. Initially, I was dazzled by the set and costumes. I enjoyed the love story of Edward and Elizabeth at the start. Then I grew tired of looking constantly at Elizabeth's frowning face and perfect complextion. Oh so many close ups! I do understand obviously that a queen always conducted herself with dignity, and was never some smiley gum-smacking gal. But enough. Fortunately, the series started turning to other characters and close ups. I hate to say, however, that every time Margaret (Henry's mother - so many Margarets!) came on screen, I ran to get a snack. Her sickening piousness and grim expressions were cringeworthy. Ann was another I could not stomach. I did not find her believable in her role at all. I found out that the king was indeed Jeremy Iron's son! Once I found that out, I couldn't stop thinking ""that's Jeremy Iron's son."" Obviously, that is a personal problem. I did like Elizabeth's mother very much. She is an amazing actress and gave much credibility to this series. Margaret of Anjou was just as good. Another reviewer commented that one needed a Google search in one's hand to get through this. I have to agree. I was looking things up constantly, and growing frustrated because all of the names were the same at the time. When all is said and done, I am a reader. I do not do well with television. So take this review as you will. You may be someone who enjoys the visuals.",1412294400,,1481,4.613636363636363

6749800,5,B00OGL6S64,"This is a great television drama with an intriguing story line, based on Philippa Gregory's historical novels. It's set against the tumult of the Wars of the Roses.

In The White Queen, Philippa Gregory brilliantly evokes the life of a common woman who ascends to royalty by virtue of her beauty. As a young queen, she rises to the demands of her position and fights tenaciously for the survival of her family. Her two sons become the central figures in a mystery that has confounded historians for centuries: the Princes in the Tower whose fate remains unknown to this day.",1407628800,,574,4.74

6749842,5,B00OGL6S64,"For those who love English history and are fascinated by detail, accurate costuming and flawless reenactment of history, this is a wonderful work of art. The casting and characterization was marvelous. For those who may feel that Richard III has always been given a bad rap by the Tudor historians, this work pretty much vindicates him or at least shows that there were many other family members near the crown who wanted the two boys in the Tower to be dead; not least of which was Margaret Beaufort.

I do have to admit, that it does help substantially if you are a history buff and familiar with the characters before watching this series, because it can be a tad confusing with so many of the people's names and physical appearances being similar. Also, as was common in the 15th century, people are called sometimes by their actual names, sometimes by their titles, and sometimes by where they were from. For example, George, the brother of Richard III and King Edward IV may be called at different points: George Plantagenet, George of York, the Duke of Clarence, the 1st Earl of Salisbury, or  the 1st Earl of Warwick when his father-in-law before him was also the Earl of Warwick, so it can be a bit confusing.

But over all, as I said, for English history enthusiasts and supporters of Richard III, it is a marvelous series with hours of enjoyment. I learned a lot from it. One always thinks of the powerful men in history, but this work shows that at least during the Wars of the Roses, one must not forget that much of the results and the end result, in particular, were controlled from behind the scenes by some very courageous, determined and very powerful women.",1404950400,,1676,4.636363636363637

Presented in such a way that the viewer could connect with and understand the personalities and complicated actions of the people it was all about.  If you are a history buff, you'll really like this.  And if after, you want a bit more detail, go on-line and look up how the remains of King Richard was recently discovered also the controversy about the also recent effort to open the tomb of  Edward & Elizabeth's two ""missing Princes"" from these times.

I googled a lot of the information, as my War of the Roses knowledge is thin and they did quite a great job following the actual events with some age/timing gaps, but otherwise, pretty dead on.  My only beef was the constant repetition of outfits....very confusing. Maybe it's historically accurate, but once I started noticing that certain characters wear the same outfit nearly every day, it consumed me to the point I would audibly exclaim, ""Why?? Why does Anne Neville always wear that stupid green dress with the fur?!""",1401926400,,676,4.777777777777778

I guess seeing it in a series really made it easier for me to make connections in the books.  Plus, I have to say that the series really does go hand and hand with the book.  Normally if you have read the books the movies/series just destorys it.  I can honestly say this is not how it is with these two.  If you have read the books this purchase is very much needed.  Do not delay and express your opinion for another Season.  I can only imagine how much better it would be than Season 1.  They have so many avenues they can take.

Even the bloody cover image of one of the young nubile cast members earnestly clutching a broadsword is patently absurd on the face of it.  Never would've happened.  Back then, in the late 15th c. England this so feebly purports to portray, they never did have their bints in the armed forces- not even the gentry, whatever other perversions to which they may have been enslaved, would have given training in the bearing of arms to womens, getting their bloody poonts all in the way of serious men doing a serious bloody day's work on the campaign trail (and I do not refer to the muddled up gabfests at court depicted so gratingly here- you involve, fictively, trollops in Men's business and what more can you bloody expect? Neither here nor there, as it isn't war and, thus, doesn't signifiy in the Least). This is yet another clear instance of Revisionist entertainment history, which after the Disaster that was Bosworth Field (depending on your rooting allegiance) I should think  the BBC would steer well bloody clear of.  Give this one a miss.  Vikings is much more to the point.

6749920,3,B00OGL6S64,"We've watched quite a few British TV series in the last few years and most of them are quite good (better than the average American fare).  The Tudors (which perhaps should have simply been named Henry VIII), Sherlock, Downton Abbey, The Borgias (well, OK that was a US production), Inspector Moore, and others.  I had high hopes for the White Queen, which is based on a trilogy of novels written by Phillipa Gregory and centered on 3 prominent female figures in the famous ""War of the Roses"".
History buffs (I can't say I'm a scholar of English history) have nitpicked about how complex issues are condensed into simple choices; characters seem either good or evil and not well-rounded, and of course how many years of history are condensed into what seems a shorter period of time (as was The Tudors, to a high degree).  Or that occasionally you can glimpse something modern in the background.  Those things do not bother me.  The story I think gives a reasonably accurate depiction of events that went on during this time span.  What turned me off was that I started not liking ANY of the characters.  Unlike having a problem with them depicted ""good"" or ""bad"", I felt they're all grasping for power in their own way, but none of them seemed any better than the others.  If you don't feel an emotional connection with at least one character, it's hard to like a production.  That's why I left off partway through this one-season series.  If you want to grasp some of the War of the Roses and don't mind that nobody seems very noble in character, then you may enjoy this series.
The US version is prominently flagged by Starz, though it was a joint BBC/Staz production.  It totals 3 DVDs and subtitles are available as well as 11 ""special features"" on the DVD set.",1398816000,,1766,4.610223642172524

I expected something like The Tudors - soapy fun without much fact checking. On that front it totally delivered. This is a great (almost campy) series with a bucket of magical powers thrown in without much purpose. Because it's a BBC series it expects more familiarity with the characters and the events in their lives than the US audience is likely to have. Because it's wildly inaccurate that's probably a good thing.

Every six months without fail they have brought back another period, dazzlingly and painstakingly recreated.  Ok, not so much recreated as embellished upon.  If you loved, ""The Borgias, The Tudors, Spartacus (different time period) and Da Vinci's Demons"", then you will most likely enjoy this set.

They have taken many liberties historically, but that just makes it more interesting; at the very least for us.  It seems with all of these shows it is always about power and the struggle to keep or take.  The actors are perfectly suited for their character roles.  I have thoroughly enjoyed watching this DVD set at my leisure.  We usually order the Blu-ray versions but this DVD set will suffice.  It looked great on our HD televisions; just missing all of the extras.

I would rather not go into any details regarding the series because it just spoils it for those planning to purchase the set.  If you enjoy historical drama or period pieces then this will be a sure win to add to your collection.  Keep in mind that it reads more like a historical 'novella' ripe with all the romance.

I find the emphasis on the women of the War of The Roses period of English history fascinating. Often history overlooks them or pays them passing reference. However the women of that period were critical to the way history played out.

The cast was excellent, and the costuming was great (unlike ""Reign"" where the costuming is an utter joke). I am always immensely entertained to see James Frain and he did not disappoint with his portrayal of the kingmaker. He was fantastic as always. This was the first time I'd seen Jeremy Irons or Rebecca Ferguson and I thought they were superb as King Edward IV & Elizabeth Woodville. Amanda Hale was wonderfully annoying as the self-righteous Margaret Beaufort.

I don't have a big problem with the acting, but the casting is disappointing and changes have been made to the story that are unnecessary.
In the books, King Edward is described as a big, strapping man (Chris Hemsworth comes to mind). Max Irons is good looking, but he's slender and pretty - not the manly-man described. I can't buy into this boy as Edward.
Baron Rivers is supposed to adore Jaquetta, but seems mostly annoyed with her.  In the book, when Elizabeth first arrives at court, he instructs her to be 'more royal than royal' to prove they belong there. It seems unlikely they would hug and behave so casually as they do in the show when they are trying to establish themselves among the nobility.
While I don't have an issue with nudity in films, in this show it often comes off as gratuitous.  What is the point of showing Elizabeth's sister in the bath?
I was excited to find the books had been adapted; now I'm just disappointed and am kicking myself for not watching the first episode before buying the entire season (I had a feeling, even as I clicked the Buy button).  I don't know if I can bring myself to watch more.",1396828800,3,1190,4.5

Let's agree to put aside every thing we know about the real history and forget Shakespeare's ""Richard the 3rd"" and just go along with the narrative the show provides us, it  still  comes up very short in providing a convincing motives for the main characters to do what they do. Here Richard, Earl of Gloucester, the future king Richard the 3rd, is depicted as an honorable man, a loyal brother and a decent chap generally, so - whatever makes him do all the horrible things he does? Why should he go against his own beloved brother dying wish to secure the throne for his son? Shakespeare gave us a motive - ambition, and created a character who is definitely the inspiration to Kevin spacey's character in ""House of card"" - a cold blooded villain who will stop at nothing to get what he wants. But this is not the case here, so Richard's action are puzzling and his character just totally flips from righteous to evil out of no where. People whom you saw generally getting along suddenly are at each other's throats without anything major happening.

The focus of the show was to highlight the influence of the WOMEN and how they shaped  the history, but I have to say they failed there as well, as they did not create a single memorable character that can actually make you believe she can influence anyone. The titular character, the white queen, Queen Elizabeth, is indeed very beautiful and sweet so you can buy how her husband  fell for her and married her  despite of his family's objection, but her sweet nature stand in bitter contrast to what you'd expect from a figure in the middle of such a power struggle. She seems to be  a person who'll have a hard time not tipping a sloppy waiter in a restaurant, let alone scheme and plot and advice her husband in real life and death situation. As for her woman adversaries, they are not so well constructed as characters and again it's hard to say what are their reasons for hating her so much. The only one whose motives are well explained is Lady Margaret, and that is because she is simply raving mad, and super annoying.

It was a disappointment, because it could have been so much more. It's like a poor man's ""game of thrones"", which is a darn shame, considering GRR Martin whole inspiration for his story of came from this  cruel and bloody piece of history. I enjoyed the beautiful costumes, there were a few attractive actors and the love story between the King and queen is touching, but as a drama it just did not work.",1396828800,,2686,4.528925619834711

. . . .

Just looking at the cover art, I didn't have high hopes for this series: it obviously seemed like a ""Game Of Thrones"" wannabee or a trashy historical bodice-ripper like ""The Tudors"" turned out to be.  But, oh, what a pleasant surprise ""The White Queen"" proved to be. This series expertly presents the insanely complex political machinations of the War Of The Roses, as seen through the template of the marriage of Edward IV and his queen, Elizabeth Woodville. Edward's relatively long reign set the stage for the infamous drama of Richard The Third, Edward's brother who basically stole the throne after his death, and whose defeat at the Battle Of Bosworth marked a decisive end to the war for the crown.

The characters in this series are vivid and compelling, the scripts are intelligent and suspenseful, and the acting is generally superlative. The largely sympathetic portrayal of Richard is a welcome change of pace from Shakespeare's well-known villainous caricature and other characters similarly emerge as flawed yet fascinating figures, and all of them believable and multi-faceted. The series is remarkably good on the history -- accurate (though opinionated) up through the drama of ""the Princes in the Tower,"" where there is no solid historical record to draw on... This is an excellent entry to the genre of historical fiction about the English monarchy, and is very rewarding both as fact and as fiction.

Sitting down to binge-watch this series with a good rack of mutton, an open cask of wine and Wikipedia's English history articles available when you need them is an experience not to be missed! (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews",1396742400,,1692,4.968197879858657
6749956,5,B00OGL6S64,I absolutely loved this series and was sad when I finished my discs. Knowing how the stories unfolds didn't change how much I enjoyed watching it. I have read some of Philippa Gregory's works but she has not been my most favorite author but now I may have to re-introduce myself to her work.,1396656000,,291,4.407407407407407
6749957,4,B00OGL6S64,"Let's just say to take the premise of the War of the Roses, and make a miniseries based on the overall history and players, but containing little accuracy of events and interactions.  That about sums it up.

As a fan of historical fiction, I can get behind a bit of loose accuracy.  Even fans of the Shakespeare 'histories' understand that there is little true historical accuracy beyond the broad description of events.  And I am a fan of Shakespeare's histories!

So dropping the accuracy guideline, this is an outstanding series, though something keeps it from being quite five stars.  The acting is overall very good, but the actual story chugs at times.  I surmise that my hesitation of a five star rating comes from comparing it to other series in a similar vein.

One huge plus: the costumes and setting are very well done for the time.  Viewers should watch the series if for nothing more than that!",1396569600,,907,4.689873417721519

6749960,4,B00OGL6S64,"I found this series to be very faithful to the novel ""The White Queen,"" the first of Ms Gregory's series on the War of the Roses. It is told from the point of view of the women, and in this series two women in particular --- Elizabeth Woodville, Queen of England (Rebecca Ferguson), and Margaret Beaufort (Amanda Hale), the mother of Henry VII. Those who criticize the program due to some historical inaccuracies are, in my opinion, missing the point -- neither the series, or the books upon which it based, are suppose to be history lessons, but rather are entertainment based upon historical events. Anyone who has read Ms Gregory's Tudor novels knows that she puts a particular spin of her own upon historical figures...from whether Catherine of Aragon and Prince Arthur consummated their marriage to whether Elizabeth I could rightly be termed the Virgin Queen. If historical accuracy trumps what is meant as pure entertainment, then this may not be the series for you.

It is my understanding that the first season of The White Queen is also going to be the last season. It was, from what I have been able to research on the Internet, a two season program that was not renewed after the first season. I think that is a shame, as the first season was quite well done in my opinion. The cast is excellent, especially James Frain as Warwick the King Maker (and I am glad that his hair covers his ears, as they can be distracting). It is difficult to recreate battle scenes on the small screen, but I think there were enough that the viewer had a good perspective on what actually happened. I, too, noticed the presence of a zipper in one shot when the perspective queen was viewed from the back -- that was very careless on the part of the costume designer, as this is not live television where anything could happen. I did not see that repeated in later scenes. The love story of Elizabeth Woodville and Edward IV (the handsome and talented Max Irons) was quite well done -- the beautiful couple of their day. Rebecca Ferguson was absolutely gorgeous and a very expressive actress. I am glad to have this miniseries as part of my personal DVD library will no doubt watch it again and again. For the purists among us, just remember that these events took place almost 600 years ago, and over time facts become distorted.

6749965,5,B00OGL6S64,"I enjoyed this series very much as historical FICTION, although theres part of me that thinks it would benefit someone trying to learn the history of the Wars of the Roses as well. That section of history is so convoluted with people switching sides, friends becoming enemies, brother against brother, etc, that it might be easier to first identify with characters before trying to learn the real history. (But then again, maybe someone interested in the history doesnt need a crash course to get it.)

There are, of course, some parts of the series that are more obviously fiction than others. The witchcraft, for example, although its historical fact that Jacquetta Woodville was tried as a witch, so there is some basis for it. I also, personally, think there was just way too much gratuitous sex. Yeah, I know it was on cable, but still.

I found this series so much more enjoyable than The Tudors. Maybe its because Ive read more nonfiction about the Tudor era so the historical inaccuracies were more grating to me; or maybe I just find the Wars of the Roses stranger than fictionYes, you can make this stuff up, but isn't it crazy to think this is (more or less) how it really happened? Because fiction or not, there is historical fact here.

And yes, I read and loved the Philippa Gregory books (again, as historical FICTION), and was happy that there were much fewer mentions of the goddess Melusina in the show. THANK YOU.

SPECIAL FEATURES: There are a bunch of special features on the DVD, but each is less than 5 minutes and some of the information/interviews overlap. My favorite was the feature about the sets; its awesome how they built the corridors and rooms that could be swapped out for other rooms.

6749968,4,B00OGL6S64,"For those who enjoy historical fiction or stories taking place during this time period, you should enjoy The White Queen which is based on the books by Philipa Gregory.  The costumes and scenery look and feel authentic to the time period for the most part, and I found the acting enjoyable.  The series starts off pretty fast-paced through the first few episodes but after that seems to lag a bit, I wish they had spent a little more time on some of the issues that arise throughout the series.  For those who are history buffs or sticklers for detail you will likely have a hard time with this.  When it comes to turning history into a tv series I think it's rather expected that they will forego many and sometimes important details just to make the story more interesting or make the series last longer.  Overall it was a fun series, I'm curious to see if they'll extend it and film another season based on some of the other characters.",1396310400,,939,4.5

6749970,3,B00OGL6S64,"Initially, I should disclose that I am far from an expert on English history, so I'm not in a position to assess the historical accuracy of this series. I'm not so bad that egregious anachronisms would be likely to get by me, but I really don't know much about the history of the various monarchies. Sticklers for historical accuracy should read other reviews to see whether the series will meet their criteria.

I enjoyed the series, so I'll focus first on the parts I like. First, the setting and costumes are excellent. I had no trouble imagining the time period, and the show is lovely to look at. (That said, I suspect that many of the settings were less luxurious in reality than they appear here.) The acting seems across-the-board solid. And certainly, after a slightly slow start, the show has more than enough drama, machinations, and scheming to satisfy people who want drama.

The season kept me entertained, but I don't know that I'll be watching it again. The character of Edward IV was not as compelling as I had hoped, and there was an excess of sex here. I'm not trying to be prudish, but the people who put together this release seemed to believe that it was necessary to stop the action periodically to show more skin. Or maybe there's just something inherently off-putting about seeing a queen naked, as if we are transgressing merely by watching. Either way, I thought the pacing of the show as a whole could have been better.",1396137600,,1447,4.6484375
6749971,3,B00OGL6S64,"Although this is a very fictitious version of ""The War of the Roses,"" the acting, costuming and cinematography on The White Queen was fantastic. I can't say I enjoyed this as much as The Tudors or The Borgias and other docu-drama series, but as a mini-series this was entertaining for what it was. I'm not sure why this is being sold as ""The White Queen: Season 1"" when the packaging states it was a mini-series and I can't imagine what they'd do for a second season, but just know if you HAVEN'T watched this - The White Queen is not getting a second season. It was designed as a ten episode mini-series for the Starz network and that's exactly what you are getting here.

The first three episodes were pretty good and we watched them in a row. The pacing was fast and the storytelling was tight but as the series went on, things really began to drag. it was as if the scriptwriters realized they were going way to fast through ""The Cousin's War"" novels and had to slow things down and drag things out to meet the ten episode commitment. As such, the pacing dramatically changed and we started to get bored with the series towards the end. We found the series to be worth watching, but it's not something we'd watch again or recommend for owning. Netflix it, rent it or wait for it to come out on streaming.",1396137600,,1308,4.404958677685951
6749972,2,B00OGL6S64,"In general, I love British period pieces, so I jumped at the opportunity to watch and review ""The White Queen,"" even though I'd never heard of it. I should have researched it first.

In the beginning, I found myself intrigued by Elizabeth (who would become the White Queen). I didn't care much for Edward, but I figured he would grow on me. Instead, as the series progressed, I found myself bored--too much talking, too many time jumps, not enough action. Except for bedroom action. Seriously, there is so much sex and nudity in this series! (Apparently, the version that ran on the BBC was much tamer, but the Starz version, which is what the DVD version is, added to the sex and nudity.)

I know many people greatly enjoyed this series, but it wasn't for me.",1396051200,7,760,4.580882352941177
6749973,5,B00OGL6S64,"It was only a matter of time before premium television networks like Starz discovered the drama and pageantry inherent in the great moments of English history. The Wars of the (red and white) Roses, brilliantly dramatized by Shakespeare in several of his history plays, was a conflict between the powerful York and Lancaster houses for control of the crown of England, and was one of the most important struggles in England's illustrious, storied past.

Based on a popular novel by Philippa Gregory, The White Queen recounts a fictionalized version of the political tensions that were the seedbed from which modern England sprung. It is superb drama, regardless of whether or not it is strictly authentic (it isn't). The writing is excellent, the acting brilliant (as is usual for an English production) and the production values and cinematography are stunning to look at.

This series is most definitely worth watching, regardless of the medium you choose. However, if you are able to purchase the Blu-Ray discs rather than the standard definition DVDs, you will find the high-definition version gorgeous to look at and infinitely more engrossing. The beauty and pageantry of late-Medieval England seems to come alive with remarkable vivacity as the intensity of colors, textures and sounds takes a quantum leap upwards. Large screen televisions will appreciate Blu-Ray high-definition images and if you screen your films through a home-theater system, you will find the improved focal accuracy and increased naturalness of high-definition audio to frequently catch your breath, it is that good.",1396051200,,1597,5.333333333333333

6749976,3,B00OGL6S64,"I enjoyed this TV series and found that the acting was great and the set superb. Okay, so there are a few historical inaccuracies with the costume etc., but not enough to divert from the overall enjoyment of the show. (Besides, part of the fun can always be spotting such inaccuracies, right?)
I found the series to be a much more tame version of ""Game of Thrones""--less action, more talking. If that doesn't sound appealing to you then stay clear of it. Also, if blatant fiction being portrayed as fact will drive you around the twist then I advise you to stay clear of it also. To name but a few; Elizabeth Woodville and her mother are shown to be witches, Anne Neville is portrayed as a harsh and greedy harpy and Margaret Beaufort's piety is shown to such extremes that she comes across as entirely loony. Overall, very dramatized personas that, of course, make for good TV. (And historical fiction too for that matter, which you'll already be familiar with if you've ever read any of Gregory's novels). If you don't enjoy facts being bended in such a way then, again, this really isn't the show for you.
If however you can get past this and are one of those people who can actually watch a show without believing everything you see, then I do recommend the series for it's captivating characters and political intrigue. It's full of mystery and suspense, love and sex, not to mention the tense familial relations that lead to national disaster time and time again. It even has the ""who-done-it"" aspect of a murder mystery--it's really all in here.
I just hope that if you are not familiar with the War of the Roses/The Cousins War, or the various theories associated with the Princes in the Tower, that you will research them after you've watched the series, and not just take Gregory's word as gospel.

However, I have read enough historical fiction (particularly that about the English courts) to know that Philippa Gregory writes entertaining novels but takes a lot of creative license in developing her stories.  So while I enjoyed this series, I do not take it as a gospel of what actually happened.  I feel the same way about the series The Tudors- which I also loved, but knowing more about that time period, I was fully aware that some of the story lines were not at all based on fact.  This particular show was, in my opinion, not as well produced as The Tudors and appears to be of a lower budget.  The acting was solid for the most part- I always enjoy James Frain and was glad to see him again.  The witchery of the Woodville women seemed pretty unbelievable on screen.  I have read the book The White Queen and it fit well into the story, but doesn't really translate well from print to TV.  And with the exception of Jasper Tudor, none of the adult characters seemed to age at all even though this story takes place over quite a lengthy time period.  Having addressed some of the shortcomings of this series, I will say that I couldn't stop watching.  It was an enjoyable way to relax and transport my mind into another time. . .I bumped my rating up to 4 stars. . .was thinking it should be 3 1/2, but because I was slightly addicted to watching every episode I decided it deserved a round up to 4.",1395532800,,1572,4.367697594501718

However, this version of events differs significantly from other sources (e.g. Shakespeare's writing and others).  Without wanting to give any spoilers, this focuses on the women of the period and seems at times like a feminist retelling of the story.  Not that this is a bad thing, but the film takes liberties with its attempts to fill in details that don't seem to have historical evidence and uses magic and witchcraft to explain events (and serve as a source of power for the female characters).

  The casting of Anne is this series is horrendous. They turn her into an ugly, dowdly frump, wearing the same ugly dress scene after scene. Beauteous. Get it? The author wanted to make Richard a hero, so they uglied up the character of Anne, so he would seem soooo romatic for marrying her. Not buying it. That Richard may have been enamoured with this beautiful girl I can accept. That she was enamoured with him, I cannot. He was a very plain man, and very physically handicapped.
  The stupid sex and nudity is just a distraction. They look like they're jumping each other like dogs. The casting of the other characters was fine. And I found Margaret Beaufort's role riveting. It seems everybody is getting raped in this film. We don't need to see that.
  The story is complex and I have read the history on this extensively.  They make several errors.
1. According to an account Anne, runs away from her evil brother in law and winds up in a bake shop in London, after which she gets a message to her cousin Richard who fetches her and takes to a convent (He left her there for three months to make sure she was not pregnant). This is deleted. Also, the series states that Richard got Anne's money. No, Clarence got all of it. Richard fought hard for her fortune but essentially married her, as they say, in her shift.
2. The series shows Richard showing up at court. shortly before  Edward, his brother, dies. NO. Richard stopped the young Prince of Wales on his journey to London and took custody of him. I don't think Richard even got to the funeral in time.
3. The producer evidently did not like the coifs and caps women wore to cover their hair. All the married women are running around with their hair showing. Women shaved their hairlines and raised their eyebrows and covered all their hair, except for maybe a lovelock.
4. The producer didn't like the men's hairstyles of the time either, which required their version of a styling wand. They all look like boys in some teeny bopper rock band.
5. They all speak modern English which annoyed me very much. They sound like they just came out of my High School.
6. Richard had scoliosis, which is confirmed after finding his grave. The degree was severe. He probably walked with a cane.
This Richard looks fit, and a little cute (Is it Fodo?)",1395360000,,2488,4.573033707865169

Like Philippa Gregory, Alison Weir and others, the series looks behind the scenes to the women behind the historical figures that dominate England's politics and the warring houses of Lancaster and York, Elizabeth Woodville, commoner wife of Edward IV, Margaret Beaufort, mother of Henry VII and Anne Neville, wife of Richard III.

For those familiar with this fascinating and volatile era in English history, the casting is critical, setting the stage for well-known characters. While I was disappointed with the choice of actress for Woodville, Rebecca Ferguson, the role of her mother, Jacquetta, was perfectly captured by Janet Mc Teer. Pairing Ferguson with Max Irons as Richard IV, produced the required chemistry, but I felt some of the historical detail was sacrificed in favor of romance. However, Amanda Hale portrayed the pious Margaret Beaufort to perfection. Many viewers are inspired by historical dramas to research further, but there is always the risk of mistaking an embellished tale for fact, a traumatic era made more palatable by the attractive leads and their shocking love affair. Beyond the early days with Edward, Woodville was a formidable presence, capable of much mischief and politically sophisticated by the time her daughter, Elizabeth was wed to Henry VII.

 As for cinematography and special effects, I have fewer expectations of Starz when viewing these epic historical dramas. As in the past (the Ken Follett epic), I found the sets less elaborate, the crowds sparser in mob  and combat scenes and the interiors less detailed, a situation perhaps dictated by budget. HBO, in contrast, pulls out all the stops (Game of Thrones), lavishing as much energy on atmosphere as on script and characters, as did Showtime for The Tudors. Aside from issues of historical accuracy, such attention to detail often makes a difference in the visual and emotional impact of the experience (the exception being the staging of classic Shakespeare plays, which require little else but the superior acting they inspire). I thought the costumes in The White Queen were questionable as well, Woodville's daytime frocks much less modest that what the period demanded- though more convenient for secret trysts with Richard. I was hoping for solid history, but often heard the violins of a Regency Romance.

As expected, Special Features round out the DVD, adding context to the history, characterization, and visual challenges of the series: The Making of The White Queen, Series Overview, Book To Series, The History Behind The White Queen, The White Queen: Set Tour, Queen Elizabeth, The King, The Heir Apparent, Woman In A Man's World, Conjuring Up The Queen/Magic, Dressing The Queen/Wardrobe. Will I invest in another season? The jury is still out. Luan Gaines/2014.",1395273600,,2943,5.22457627118644
6749989,4,B00OGL6S64,"If you love historical fiction filled with romance, murder & mystery you are sure to enjoy The White Queen. Once I finished watching Season 1, I couldn't stop thinking about the history of The War of The Roses.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that Philippa Gregory has written an entire series: The Cousins' War.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-White-Queen/dp/1416563687/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The White Queen</a>&nbsp;is the first book in the series.  I hope the book is as good (if not better) than the series, as I'm hoping to have a good series to read for a bit!

Anyway... back to the Starz series.  While it was highly entertaining (my husband & I didn't want to stop watching it) it was also depressing.  Seasoned with an incredible amount of scheming, plotting, & revenge with betrayal as the main dish.  The innocent & guilty are all fair game to loosing their hearts, heads or both!  The acting is excellent.  The props, costumes & hairstyles, the scenery, battle gear & castles are a stunning compliment to the time period being portrayed.

A main character(s) has been left out of the credits... breasts. It would have been a 5 star show if it wasn't cheapened by a plentiful amount of totally unnecessary breast shots.  Seriously, a scene would be of one naked breast.  The focus of the camera wasn't on the characters faces, just the breast.  I actually burst out laughing.  It was so ridiculous.  I'm not a prude by any means & do not have any issues with nudity.  Unfortunately the way it is presented in The White Queen it is completely unnecessary & I feel it cheapened the series. Yes, they are very lovely natural breasts, but is the show about breasts or the crown?

Aside from all the lovely breasts, this is a great show & I highly recommend it especially if you are a fan of historical fiction.",1395187200,,1873,4.936102236421725
6749990,5,B00OGL6S64,"I record all the new cable series and for some reason White Queen did not record (my error on the series option).  I was a huge fan of Spartacus on Starz and was excited about the White Queen.  To start out I really know nothing about this historical period so I can not comment on how accurate it is.  What I can say is the plot moved quickley and was interesting, I watched the entire series in one sitting!  It is also nice to have a show with a strong female lead.  All in all the show meets my expectations and I look forward to the next season (this is based on a 3 part book series).",1395187200,,590,4.0085470085470085
6749991,4,B00OGL6S64,"If you enjoyed ""The Tudors"" you should enjoy ""The White Queen"".  This has a bit more female oriented twist on exploring the history of England.  A bit of ""witchcraft"" gives it an intriguing touch.  Overall good acting.  There was only a few minutes in episode 8 or 9 that dragged a bit for me, otherwise I was engaged and very much enjoying the story.",1395187200,,351,4.4375

6749993,5,B00OGL6S64,"I love Philippa Gregory.  She has a way with bringing characters to the forefront that are often glanced over throughout history.  She is a true women's writer.  Her female characters show courage, power, authority, love, and sexuality, even though they are set in a time when those characteristics were not proper for a lady.  When I heard that her novels were going to be turned into a miniseries, I was all in.  Lucky for me, this was nothing like the disappoint I felt through The Tudors.

The White Queen is told specifically from the women's point of view.  We see two houses battle for the English throne (the War of the Roses).  Instead of focusing on the battle and the men, we get to see the women's role which was often more subtle.  Each character has her own way of handling things.  Some are very outspoken while others are more manipulative behind the scenes.  The plot line of each episode moves through the schemes and pulls the watcher in.

I was impressed by the actors.  While I tend to believe the women were younger than what they appear to be, they do an excellent job of not being melodramatic.  I found them easy to keep track of, but I did read the novels long before I watched the television show.  I was impressed as my novels came to life.  There are three novels that are portrayed within this series, and the basic plot lines are followed well.  I was impressed that some of my favorite details were clearly visible within the show.",1395100800,,1463,4.522900763358779
6749994,3,B00OGL6S64,"The White Queen is a drama set in the period immediately prior to the Tudor dynasty.  It takes the perspective of three women, Elizabeth Woodville, Margaret Beaufort and Anne Neville and their quest for power.  The English throne is disputed between two families, the house of York and the house of Lancaster.  The series starts with the house of York's Edward IV being crowned King with the help of a master manipulator and his good friend Lord Warwick, but then the newly crowned King of England falls in love with and marries a beautiful Lancastrian commoner, Elizabeth Woodville, which Lord Warwick opposes.  From there the series is about the power struggles, vengeful retribution and what these three main women will do to gain the crown of England.

The White Queen is a Starz production and as you would expect contains it's fair share of nudity, although the graphic violence is surprisingly kept to a minimum.

For me the series started slowly, introducing you to the characters, background and plots of each of the main characters.  A little too slowly for my liking as it took a couple of episodes and I was almost at the point of stopping watching it, but then it got better and drew you in to the engaging plotline but ultimately tailed off again towards the end of the first series.

Production value seems fairly cheap but most of the acting is quite good but nowhere near the levels of Game of Thrones, which is so much better on every level. In saying that, if you can get past the slow initial couple of episodes this is worth watching.",1395100800,,1555,4.670329670329671
6749995,4,B00OGL6S64,"Whether you know anything about the War of the Roses, most everyone is familiar with the major people involved.  I know it mostly fom the Shakespeare plays.  But like most plays of that period it was from the male point of view Henry V, Richard III etc.

This is the period of Edward IV through Richard III reigns but it is primarily told through the eyes of three women Elizabeth, Edward's Queen, Margaret, mother of Henry VII and Anne Neville, Richard's queen.

While based on fact, there has been some dramatic license taken, especially towards the last few chapters but it is still riviting and well acted.

The entire series runs just under 10 hours and there is about an hour of extras (but these are just promo spots that Starz ran and are very repetitive.)

It was good enought that I would like to see a sequel that takes Elizabeth's daughter, Elizabeth, through her marriage to Henry VII.",1395100800,,898,4.616352201257862

It's based on three of Philippa Gregory's novels, The White Queen, The Red Queen and The Kingmaker's Daughter.  The acting, the costumes, the script, the cinematography, everything, was done very well.  What will the royal families of England do to claim the crown in the mid-1400's?  Apparently, anything!  Murder, plot, use witchcraft, prayer, seduction, anything to sit on the throne.  For me the standout performance was Amanda Hale as Margaret Beaufort.  She bided her time for years, wishing, hoping, praying and scheming to get her son, Henry Tudor, on the throne.",1395014400,,654,5.113207547169812

6749998,4,B00OGL6S64,"I must admit I got caught up in this series much more than I thought I would. I haven't watched the other medieval-themed cable series, but I imagine this one has more in common with ""The Tudors"" than ""Game of Thrones"".  This historical drama dramatizes the War of the Roses, when two houses of the same family, the House of York (the ""White Rose"") and the House of Lancaster (the ""Red Rose"") battled for the English throne in the 15th Century. The story is based on a novel series by Philippa Gregory, and it focuses effectively on the women's role in all the intrigue, power (or lack thereof) and betrayal of the time.  The acting is uniformly excellent, though as an American viewer, I recognized few of the cast, except the wonderful Janet McTeer as Lady Rivers (Elizabeth's mother) . Amanda Hale is beautiful and captivating as Elizabeth Woodville, a ""common country girl"" (of a landed gentry family) who is wooed by and marries King Edward IV. She reminds me of a young Gwyneth Paltrow.  James Frain is intense and smoldering as the ruthless ""Kingmaker"", the Earl of Warwick.  The sets and costumes are impressive and realistic.  Though at times it's hard to figure out who's related to whom and how, and the scheming gets rather elaborate, Though based on historical facts, I'm sure much of it is romanticized - for instance, it's nice to think that Elizabeth and Edward had such a loving marriage, but the truth may be a bit less ideal. Still, it's an engaging series that, at the end, left me wanting more.",1395014400,,1515,4.659176029962547

6750006,4,B00OGL6S64,"If you like Philippa Gregory books, this is based on Philippa Gregory's The White Queen.  While Philippa Gregory is a capable student of history, some complain about the inaccuracies in this series and her books, but those inaccuracies are probably more interesting to a Doctor of History than an armchair viewer.  These inaccuracies are really more the filling in of things unproven, such as Elizabeth's mother (and Elizabeth) being witches.  There is apparently no proof of this, but it is played in a believable manor for the time.
The War of the Roses was an incredibly confusing time in English history, and if you are not a very serious student of the period, the alliances and hatreds of the period are confusing, conflicting, and changing.  I wouldn't say that after watching this series, you will understand it all, but if you can (could?) follow Years of our Lives, you will follow the action.  Indeed, the characters are human, and being nobles, sometimes more human than you or I.  While all the characters are schemers, some of the evil, they are all people you will relate to.
On the other hand, the production is marvelous.  Costumes and scenery are all eye candy. Acting is not bad.  My biggest complaint is that Edward on his death bed was the same Edward that met Elizabeth under the Oak tree. Edward at this death bed was a bit overweight and no warrior.",1394928000,,1373,4.739495798319328

It is interesting in the way that sexuality had a great deal to do with how history is affected by it and how love and lust can change decisions that affect the aristocracy and the people who must have allegiance to them. The White Queen is smart in her rise to the throne, though it is her mother who is the smartest of all. In a time of deception, chaos and death, love can exist, though not so much in a time of war.

I thoroughly enjoyed the first six episodes (even if there was some Hollywood license taken), but found the last four episodes to be so historically compromised that I almost stopped watching it a few times.  I could see no other reason to suddenly deviate from the books and history except for budget constraints.  It certainly weakened an otherwise historically accurate miniseries.  Of course most of these inaccuracies are not going to be known by people who have not studied the era and I would not dissuade someone from watching because of them.  I would urge anyone who enjoys the series to do some additional reading of this fascinating period of English history.

I hope STARZ does indeed make a series of Gregorys The White Princess wherein the story of Perkin Warbeck/Richard, Duke of York (the youngest Prince in The Tower) is told; along with the story of Elizabeth and Henry Tudor.

 All that aside, I loved the sets and costuming and felt that for the most part the actors were great picks for their characters.  Amanda Hale as Margaret Beaufort was exceptional.  I had often wondered what actor today could play Richard of Gloucester (later Richard III) and found that Aneurein Barnard was a great pick.  Only Max Irons as Edward IV seemed a little weak.  Edward was 64, handsome and imposing.  However, I do feel that Irons, although not the physical depiction of Edward, played the kings character very well.

Even with the historical problems (I found it much better than The Tudors) I plan on buying the BluRay set for my library.  It will give me my visual fix for this period that I have found so fascinating for 40 years.",1393718400,,1917,4.708708708708708

6750036,1,B00OGL6S64,"I absolutely loved the series and wanted a copy of my own to watch again and again. I just want to warn anyone who buys the DVD. I ordered it back in September and received it in early February. I played it on one of my 5 DVD players and it started to skip and stop playing shortly after Episode 3 started. I returned it. I received another copy and I played it on another DVD player and it stopped playing shortly after Episode 4 started. Not only did it stop playing, it shut down my player. I called customer service and was disconnected. I called again and complained without much sympathy -- only to suggest refunding my money or replacing the DVD. I opted for another replacement but additionally asked that they investigate the quality of the DVD and asked if anyone else had any issues with the quality. That suggestion wasn't met with any enthusiasm -- again I could return for either a replacement or refund. In the meantime I received an email saying that they wanted to make it ""right"" and shipped me a replacement at no extra charge (there wouldn't have been any extra charge anyway) and next day shipping at no extra charge.

I received the replacement DVD and played it. Again, it stopped and shut down my player shortly after Episode 4 started. I played it on another DVD player -- this one a player/TV combo. It didn't stop at Episode 4 -- it played the complete episode. However, when I turned on the TV shortly afterwards, the system wouldn't start -- even after several attempts. I'm not sure if the DVD broke my system; I can't make that claim until after I send it off for repair. But, I am reluctant/scared to play it on any other player. I'm not calling Amazon about it; it's just not worth it. Instead I plan on contacting Starz. I'm anxiously waiting for the Outlander series and will be buying that DVD when available. I can only hope that that another DVD from a STARZ production will not be defective.

This doesn't mean that I won't buy from Amazon again; I can't blame them for the DVD being defective -- I can blame them and be disappointed that they wouldn't investigate my claim.",1393545600,4,2113,4.471502590673575

6750041,4,B00OGL6S64,I read all the books in the Phillipa Gregory Cousins War or War of the Roses series.  I was very impressed with how she mixed historic fact and fiction.  The miniserious had a few differences from the books.  The ending was changed up a tiny bit and some scenes were added that were not in the books but all and all it was enjoyable to watch.  As a student of history I couldn't give it five stars only because I think it makes some assumptions that are wrong but those also go back to the books.  I don't think Henry or his mother had anything to do with the deaths of the princes in the tower.  Again just my opinion and none of us will ever know for certain.  I just feel it was more of a step Richard or Buckingham would have take verses the Tudor camp.  I also think Elizabeth (the white princess) was less in love with Richard than written and based on a few biographies I've read on her she seems to have had a happy marriage with Henry Tudor.  If she did let Richard court her I think it was more of her mothers idea then hers and as a princess raised to marry whom she was told to she would have gone along with whatever was best for her family.,1393372800,,1154,4.070796460176991

6750044,4,B00OGL6S64,Pretty good production value and overall very enjoyable for fans of medieval English drama. Costumes and sets are beautiful and the acting is solid. Overall focus on the female characters is refreshing and done quite well. Slightly different from the version that aired on the BBC (more R-rated).,1393286400,,296,5.1875
6750045,4,B00OGL6S64,"I'm a sucker for well-made costume dramas, especially those about the history of British kings and queens. And this series was very well made, with detailed but not unrealistically lavish sets and costumes, a very fine cast including some old favorites and some newer faces, and a very human story of family as well as kingdom. It inspired me to purchase the books it was based on, and I've begun reading them.

Nothing was sanitized in this production. When it's cold in Britain, you see the actors' breath -- both inside and outside their homes. You feel the slipperiness of mud and blood at battle sites. You feel the fabrics and smell the smells -- no wonder people died of fevers with such regularity.

The major characters evolve through time as they must have in real life, and you find yourself loving and then hating them, wishing you could shake them and tell them what they're planning will backfire.

All hallmarks of a well-made series and a well-told story, But it ends precipitously, and England has no real king. Well, after all, I guess that's how it was at that time and in that place. Worth watching.",1393286400,,1119,4.67005076142132

6750047,5,B00OGL6S64,"Found this series a good insight into the danger of being royalty in that time period.  Since I am a huge Tudor history fan, this was right on the money for me.  Even though women were considered property back then, it shows the power they really had.  My favorite series next to ""The Tudora""!",1393286400,,293,4.388888888888889
6750048,1,B00OGL6S64,"I came in REALLY wanting to like this, but it was super disappointing. It's very heavy on telling not showing. Now I get that to an extent: there's no way a TV show can put together movie-like grand battle scenes, and that's ok. The problem is that there's no real tension between episodes and even scenes--stuff happens off screen, you're told about it, and you move on.

The acting is so-so. Yes, all of them are pretty, but aside from a few exceptions, I really didn't find myself investing in any of the characters. James Frain is always enjoyable, and the actress playing Margaret Beaufort did a nice job too. Edward, the Lancastrian prince was creepy good, but he got so little screen time that it really didn't matter.

As a whole though, everything feels super rushed and underdeveloped. Calling it the ""poor man's Game of Thrones"" is giving it too much credit.",1393200000,28,869,4.673202614379085

I've seen many of the work put into shows and movies.  I'm a big fan.  However, this series disappoint.  The writing is shallow and predictable.  The costumes are great and the scenes are fantastic.  But so many gratuitous sex scenes and so poorly done.  Pornographic, but heavily biased towards showing just the women naked.  Is this an attempt to attract male viewers?  Really, those guys may just enjoy plain pornography.  Edward of York is portrayed as a handsome, dumb sex-fiend and his deathbed scene is overwrought.

6750057,4,B00OGL6S64,"This was a fairly good and watchable series, but covers such a broad span from 1464 to 1485 that some of the important events are shrunk into a crush of minutes and episodes.  The battle scenes in particular had so few extras and little attention to the size and scope of what was actually happening that they probably should have been excluded altogether and simply mentioned in dialogue.  Why the technology of animation for mass battle scenes could not have been employed here may have been dictated by a limited budget.  It is unfortunate. The more sumptuous court and ceremonial scenes were shot in Bruges or Ghent and are worthy.  Most of the acting is actually quite good and what may be the only appreciable movie/film depiction of the hard fighting and womanizing King Edward IV is delivered by Max Irons.  I can't recommend this series for its historical accuracy since many of the events and verdicts remain shrouded in mystery and conjecture, but will say that it can offer good entertainment for history buffs who may wish to embark upon further research.",1392854400,4,1068,4.814207650273224

6750079,3,B00OGL6S64,"This is a well made series about the war of the roses.  but as it goes on it deviates from known history to a big degree.

That doesn't mean if they were still alive that henry tudor wouldn't have had them killed when he won though!.  But  they were long dead , before the Bosworth.  It does present Richard as a good king though, which is was, he was NO tyrant. and he could have gone done as a great king if he hadn't done away with his nephews. This also has him sleep with his niece. which didn't happen as she was  virgin when she married henry tudor ! ,  History is actually NOT boring, and doesn't need these type of changes to get viewers.  The story of the white queen is told from her side mainly. And it's engaging and sort of true. except she wasn't a witch , and no one ever thought she was.

Produced by the BBC and Starz, and filmed on location in Bruges, Belgium, its based on Philippa Gregorys series, The Cousins War a.k.a. The Wars of the Roses, providing a fresh look at how family conflict between the Lancasters and the Yorks led to a 30-year war. Most are familiar with the story of Richard III, the crippled hunchback, supposedly responsible for the murder of his two young nephews in the Tower of London. We know the quotes from Shakespeare  Now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this son of York (i.e. Edward, his brother, whose symbol was the sun, then sitting on the throne of England).
And we also know Richards end quote, A horse  a horse! My kingdom for a horse!

If you do know the story of the Wars of the Roses and you know it from Shakespeare, you're in for a surprise, says actor James Frain, who plays the Kingmaker, Duke of Warwick. Shakespeare was writing under a Tudor monarchy; he was writing Tudor propaganda.

This big, evil character we know as Richard III in Shakespearean plays wasn't that, explains Aneurin Barnard, who plays the much-maligned Richard, Duke of York. The real Richard III was something quite different.

And so, generally, is everyone else in this action-packed romance, even if George, Duke of Clarence (David Oakes), still drowns in a vat of malmsey (wine). The intrigue here is finding out why.

Our story begins when commoner widow Elizabeth Woodville (Rebecca Ferguson), a Lancaster, and her two young sons confront king-to-be Edward of York (Max Irons, son of Jeremy). The chemistry between these two is immediate  and all but radiates from the screen. Edward has a well-earned rep as a ladies man  Im quick, Im brave, Im as lucky in battle as I am in love  and Elizabeth knows the score; she will not succumb to lust, no matter how tempting, until they are married.

When that happens, Kingmaker cousin Warwick goes berserk; hes been negotiating a huge dowry and land deal with the King of France, to be delivered when Edward marries a French princess. So, when the newly crowned Edward proclaims Elizabeth queen, decisively chucking his cousins applecart down the mountain, Warwick does not take it well. Edward changes the power balance of Europe over night, Frain explains.

We are the three sons of York, Richard declares, exasperated. How can we be divided by one woman?
This is how wars begin. Warwick raises an army and the men of York go to battle, while and the women scheme and plot  using a nasty blast of witchcraft here and there. In the background, a very young Henry Tudor waits to see how it all plays out. His primary task is to stay alive as his mother, the obviously disturbed Margaret Beaufort (Amanda Hale), has told him he will be king  one day.

If the series seems longer than a mere 10 episodes, its because they are so well written and theres so much to absorb. Still, theres no need for a degree in British history; all is well mapped out and the characters are unforgettable. Every actor does a convincing job of making his or her part come alive. Does it make a difference that we know Richard doesn't get his horse or that Henry Tudor succeeds to the throne? Not a jot. This is a fresh telling of an old story, one that many today claim to be more likely than Shakespeares rendition.

The Blu-ray transfer is stunning; I was dazzled by the rich, intense color and magnificent detail. (We can see every freckle on Fergusons beautiful face, every gold bead on her coronation gown. Velvets look plush enough to sink your hands into and Id personally like to walk barefoot through those green meadows.) Location shots are breathtaking, like the cool, birch forest where a battle takes place. Erotic scenes are well-lit and exquisitely shot. (Yes, sex scenes are a matter of taste; these are not for children.) Black levels are lush; exteriors and flesh tones look natural. We can see clouds of frosted breath, both inside and outside the castles. In no film has the chill of a medieval interior been more apparent. An immersive Dolby TrueHD 5.1 soundtrack balances dialogue, score, ambient noise and effects. Everything sounds precise yet natural.

I was disappointed in the extras, however. They boasted great titles: The Making of The White Queen, Series Overview, Book to Series, The History Behind The White Queen, Set Tour, Queen Elizabeth, King Edward IV, The Heir Apparent, Women in a Mans World, Conjuring Up The White Queen, and Dressing the Queen. But they are all promo pieces and only minutes long, with a lack of satisfying, in-depth info  only nuggets here and there. A map and family tree is included in the packaging, as well as a $5 coupon, good till Dec. 31, 2014, on other Starz series titles.

Dissatisfied in the low reception, the BBC and Starz have shelved plans to continue the series, saying now it was only intended as a miniseries anyway. (Humbug!) That is one crying shame, because this epic has it all: Drama, romance, betrayal, sword and ax-play, assassination, beauty and horror without launching into overwhelming gross-out. I hope BBC/Starz reconsiders. In the meantime, treat yourself to an epic series that can honestly claim the name.

In this series the physical violence of war takes a backseat to the love affairs, which I think is a good choice. Bedroom scenes are very well done and remind you that history was created by men and women who would barely qualify for a driver's license in our century.

6750106,3,B00OGL6S64,"I am not a fan of Philippa Gregory; however, I've long been interested in the Wars of the Roses and Richard III.  For example, I've read Paul Murray Kendall's and David Baldwin's biographies of Richard and Amy License's biography of his queen, Anne Neville, and I followed with great curiosity the discovery and verification of Richard's remains under a parking lot in Leicester.  Before purchasing the DVDs, I'd read a lot of negative comments about The White Queen miniseries but I'd also read positive comments about some of the performances.  I was particularly interested in Aneurin Barnard's performance as Richard, Duke of Gloucester, later Richard III.  The miniseries had already started filming when Richard's skeleton was discovered showing that he'd had scoliosis, which would have made one shoulder higher than the other as contemporary accounts described Richard.  The skeleton also showed that Richard was not as deformed as Shakespeare described so even though Barnard plays him without any deformity, his performance still seems closer to the historical Richard than Shakespeare's psychopathic crippled hunchback with a withered arm.

Other reviewers have discussed the historical errors so I won't go over them again except to say I found them very annoying and they did interfere with my enjoyment of the miniseries and are the reason I rated it three stars.  I was disappointed by the Special Features since many of them seemed to be rehashes of the same interviews.  However, since I primarily bought the miniseries for the performances, I'm satisfied.  In addition to Aneurin Barnard, I must especially mention how much I enjoyed Rupert Graves as the slimy, self-serving Lord Stanley and Amanda Hale as Lady Margaret Beaufort.",1391644800,5,1748,5.281588447653429

6750113,5,B00OGL6S64,"I don't think Ive mentioned this much, but I LOVE historical shows that are set in medieval times.  That particular period of time in history has always drawn me for some reasonIm not sure why.  Thankfully, there are plenty of titles available to keep my interest sharp:  PILLARS OF THE EARTH, THE TUDORS, just to mention a couple, and now THE WHITE QUEEN.  I have to admit, though:  of all the titles Ive watched, THE WHITE QUEEN is now one of my favorites!

I honestly wasn't expecting to like this series as much as I do.  It is gripping and raw, just like the subject matter of which it is about.  And the production value appears very high, which in turn makes for a more believable, and therefore enjoyable, series.

THE WHITE QUEEN is shot well and looks great onscreen.  Theres no doubt Starz spares no expense when it comes to this show, and the result is a realistic depiction of a dark time in Europes history.  Theres more throne-hopping and power-grab attempts in this show than a soap opera.  And, whats even better:  this show is based on fact.

I cannot say just how much of the show is based on true events, but I have done enough research to know the primary basis itself is sound.  These events did happen and involved the characters that we get to see onscreen.  But as for the particularsthe writers might have taken a few liberties here and thereIm just not sure.  Regardless, this show is full of drama, backstabbing, power clashes, battles, and romance.  You just cant ask for much more!

The acting in THE WHITE QUEEN is superb, with Rebecca Ferguson portraying the titular character.  Ferguson does an amazing job with her role, giving a fully convincing version of Queen Elizabeth.  The rest of the cast is stellar as well, with particularly memorable performances by James Frain as Lord Warwick The Kingmaker, Max Irons as King Edward, and Janet McTeer as Elizabeths mother, Jacquetta Woodville.

My sole complaint about the show is that it starts off pretty fast-paced before it finally slows down around the third episode or so.  This is a minor complaint, and I understand why it is done:  the events that lead up to the turmoil are only secondary in the show, and the production team has to quickly set the tone and basis for the show itself.  Still, I do feel it worth mentioning, just so you're not caught off guard should you give the show a look.

And I highly recommend that you do.  THE WHITE QUEEN is one of my favorite shows out right now, and I am looking forward to season two.  This season hits store shelves tomorrow, so make a note.",1391385600,,2577,4.555555555555555

6750118,5,B00OGL6S64,"I am a big fan of Tudor history, and as this leads up to the Ascension of Henry Tudor to Henry VII, I enjoyed this quite a bit.
It is of course historical fiction, so everything it portrays isn't true. I was not surprised to see that they chose to portray Elizabeth Woodville trading a lookalike to take her son Richard's place; it fits in with so many novels I've read of the time period, and people want to believe that something like that happened. It didn't, though, so it irked me that it was included.
Also, the idea that it was Margaret Beaufort or her son, Henry Tudor that killed the princes in the tower. Puh-leeze. While Richard was still king, the whole country was talking about how the princes had disappeared and all he would have had to do is show the country they were, in fact, still alive. The only reason he would not do that is because, well, he couldn't. They were dead. I can come up with no other logical reason that he would not just put the rumors to rest once and for all. People love a conspiracy theory, the idea that history got it wrong and it was the more unconventional view that is more correct. It's the reason so many people are fascinated by the Kennedy assassination and the idea that it was a conspiracy and there was more than one shooter.
Although sometimes history gets it wrong, this time, history got it right. Richard III murdered the princes in the tower. Just once I'd like to see a fiction that portrayed what really happened and not this fantasy that Richard was this great guy who was framed.",1387411200,2,1542,4.395104895104895
6750119,4,B00OGL6S64,"Forget historical accuracy. Done that? Good, because ""The White Queen"" has very little, even less so than the books by Philippa Gregory upon which they are based. The sooner you accept that, the more you can enjoy a mini-series that doesn't claim to be anything but a loose dramatization of the War of the Roses, starting from 1464 with the meeting of King Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville, and ending with the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485.

The time was ripe for a dramatization of the War of the Roses given the immense popularity of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/George-R-R-Martin-s-A-Game-of-Thrones/dp/0345535529/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">George R. R. Martin's A Game of Thrones</a>&nbsp;and the subsequent HBO television adaptation, for the author has made no secret of how much this period of English history inspired his own work of fiction. In fact, for fans of the books, it's hard not to watch ""The White Queen"" without drawing correlations between the two: Henry Tudor's situation is very much like that of Daenerys Targaryen, whilst Robert Baratheon seems to owe his existence to King Edward IV. Cersei Lannister might well be a less-than-kind depiction of the titular White Queen, and even the emblem of the famous rose sigils of Lancaster and York can be found in the fictional Tyrells' standard. It stands to reason that if you enjoy one, you'll enjoy the other.

But what ""The White Queen"" brings to the table is an emphasis on the women that were involved in the period, namely Elizabeth Woodville (wife of King Edward), Anne Neville (daughter of the man known as ""the kingmaker"") and Margaret Beauford (mother of Henry Tudor). Far from being passive observers to the drama, the mini-series makes good on its promise to depict the events from their eyes, and has them right in the midst of the intrigue and violence that characterizes this tumultuous period.

Worth noting however is that this is not so much a miniseries about the War of the Roses, but an adaptation of author/historian Philippa Gregory's take on the events in question. Based on three of her books:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-White-Queen/dp/1476735484/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The White Queen</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Red-Queen/dp/1476746303/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Red Queen</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Kingmaker-s-Daughter/dp/1451626088/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Kingmaker's Daughter</a>, various plot-points and characters are based on *her* specific understanding of what really happened, a relatively important distinction to keep in mind when you watch. Some historical figures are cast in an unsympathetic light (poor Duchess Cecily gets the worst of it, portrayed here as an embittered old harridan), whilst others can come across as noble heroes or helpless victims. Gregory's rather notorious reputation for distorting the facts to suit her favourites or to increase the levels of drama (seriously, don't believe *anything* you see in this show regarding Richard III's relationship with Elizabeth of York) means that everything seen here should be taken with a pinch of salt.

But you could have probably assumed some degree of historical inaccuracy simply by watching. From the perfect skin and whitened teeth of the actors, to the visible drainpipes on the buildings and rubber-soled boots worn by the men, to the inexplicable decision to film the Battle of Bosworth FIELD in what is clearly a FOREST, there's not a huge amount of effort in keeping it realistic.

But the main points of what became known as the War of the Roses are all touched upon: the controversial marriage of King Edward to Elizabeth Woodville, the Mad King and the Bad Queen, the on-going warfare between York and Lancastrian households, George of Clarence's execution, the mystery of the Princes in the Tower, Richard's stressful reign as king, and finally the invasion of Henry Tudor's forces.

Emerging from the ensemble cast are several stand-outs: James Frain as a scheming Lord Warwick, Rupert Graves (best known as Lestrade from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sherlock/dp/B00499LTLM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sherlock</a>) as the opportunistic Lord Stanley, and Rebecca Ferguson as the titular White Queen, who combines beauty and charisma with steel and fire. Veerle Baetens also has a small but unforgettable role as Margaret of Anjou.

For me however, it's Aneurin Barnard as King Richard III and Amanda Hale as Margaret Beauford who really steal the show. Barnard's portrayal of Richard throws him into a far more sympathetic light than what we are used to, freeing the man from the most famous depiction of him as the black-hearted villain in Shakespeare's play. Here Richard is an honourable but conflicted man, grappling with a fraught political situation and driven to the edge by circumstances: the product of bad luck, wrong-headed decisions, treacherous counsel, and enduring rumours surrounding the disappearance of his nephews that he cannot be rid of.

Hale depicts Margaret Beaufort as a terrifyingly fanatical woman, engrained with the belief that her son Henry Tudor is destined to be king and not afraid to stamp out anyone who might get in the way of that. Combining hypocrisy with sincere piety, ruthlessness with moments of regret, and godliness in the struggle against her own vanity, she ends up dominating every scene she's in. If there is one weak note it's that Henry Tudor is not given particularly strong characterization, and for such a pivotal figure in the drama he ends up too bland to garner much of an opinion of him one way or the other.

Because of the format of the miniseries, several established characters drop from the action without warning once their roles are complete: Duchess Cecily, Margaret of Anjou and the Countess of Warwick are such narrative casualities, and you'll have to turn to Wikipedia to get an idea of their eventual fates. Likewise, the ending itself is quite abrupt, and it'll be interesting to see if Starz will follow through on its promise to adapt Philippa Gregory's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-White-Princess/dp/1451626096/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The White Princess</a>&nbsp;in order to continue the story of the surviving characters.

Speaking of which, it's worth pointing out that the Starz and BBC versions of ""The White Queen"" differ in a number of ways. The Americans were treated to more racy sex scenes, but there were also a few other bits and pieces that were either deleted or added, including a scene that puts an entirely new spin on what was really going on between Richard III and Elizabeth of York.

There's no doubt that even though the men are the movers and shakers, the women are the protagonists, with a particular emphasis on how they try to negotiate the pathways of influence and power. Whatever else you may think of the miniseries as quality television or as an accurate depiction of the period, I can appreciate that the women remain the focus throughout, something that's still rare enough in historical dramas to warrant praise.",1386115200,212,7337,5.642792384406165

6750129,5,B00OGL6S64,"This miniseries is that adaptation of the three historical FICTION books, The White Queen, The Red Queen, + The Kingmaker's Daughter.  Be aware, it is FICTION and there are a lot of inaccuracies against historical fact.  It's based on the War of the Roses.

If you can suspend belief, and just watch it as a beautiful medieval mini-series (facts be damned!) it's very, very good. Lies, betrayal, death, sex, glorious costumes, good actors & actresses and more.  If you loved Camelot, you'll love this!

However, if you're a stickler for historical accuracy, then pass on this. Since I'm not a stickler for accuracy, I enjoyed it immensely.

Breathtaking costuming & sets. I just loved it, and plan on buying the miniseries.",1381536000,3,723,4.933884297520661
6750130,2,B00OGL6S64,"I watched some of the episodes on cable and also read the book. The author did a fair job of making an unlikeable character sympathetic, although she had to do it by making Margaret (Henry VII's mother) into an unsympathetic person. I found that the movie concentrated far too much on the sex scenes and not enough on the actual plot also. But then, this is a fault of most made for cable channel movies. Witness ""Game of Thrones!""",1381276800,8,431,4.468354430379747
6750131,2,B00OGL6S64,"For starters, I could never get past the first episode because of how dull and disgusted I was with one scene in particular. The acting is good, but there were other things severely lacking in the series which also turned me off of it rather quickly.

For starters, I was able to pick out zippers on several of the costumes. You don't like these sorts of things for immersion purposes - it takes you out of the story and you have a hard time believing what is going on is actually set back in time.

I found the style of filming perhaps a bit odd. The picture wasn't as crisp as I would have liked it to be. The style reminded me of the series Rome, however Rome pulled it off a lot better in every way imaginable.

Secondly one thing that really bothered me was when the main character, and her main love interest - the future king, at the time were first starting to get together.

[spoilers for episode 1]
The scene bothered me because he was basically going to rape her, and the only reason he didn't was because she pulled a knife on him, and threatened to kill herself. Personally I hate when things like sexual assault are used as romance devices. Yes, this was something that frequently happened in the past. HOWEVER, how is something like this supposed to convince me that she is so in love with him, and he with her? (Yes, I am aware she actually did want to sleep with him but wasn't going to because of the fact she knew she would be easily tossed aside if she slept with him right away and because of the shame in doing so - but no means no, regardless of the character/person's reasonings for refusal and the male character should have respected that. Which would be historically inaccurate but at least it would give me a reason to actually believe in some sort of...relationship between them.) I seriously doubt a woman would fall head over heels for a man like that.

It just totally broke immersion and offended me for personal reasons.

Now, while I have not read the White Queen, or the series of books off of that one, I have read Phillipa Gregory's books before. So those who are saying she is historically accurate either have no idea what they're talking about or are just going off what other people are telling them. In several of her books most of the major plot points are factual but a lot of things she inputs are pure fiction. While they are historical fiction books, I'm just pointing out that this is likely the same way. It really doesn't hinder from the story for those who aren't really into the time period, but for those who are it's something that breaks the immersion.",1381017600,8,2608,4.422916666666667

It really has got me interested in the history of these families! It was very entertaining!",1531699200,,257,4.375
8683453,3,B00OGL6S64,"Too bad that few seems to make a show without gratuitous nudity. I'm not prude but frankly I can't care less to watch women breasts and people ""doing it"".
Aside that the all show is a fantasy made up of wild speculations,writers don't seems to have bother to check much of the historical accounts, from ladies with unbounded hairs and no hairdresses; to the accounts of the real characters of the war of the roses.
And what is with Lady Margaret Beaufort ? Why in the show a staunch Lancastrian will tell her son that he is to be King with Henry Vi still alive with a live healthy male heir? Wouldn't that be treason(to the Lancasters ) ? And why is she portrayed as a nut job?

A lot of good actors,I didn't like the performance of Rebecca Ferguson ( Elizabeth Woodville ) or Faye Marsay ( Anne Neville) , I did like the cast of Max Irons ( Edward IV) , Aneurin Barnard ( Richard III ) , David Oakes ( George, Duke of Clarence) and James Frain ( Richard Neville  Earl of Warwick).
Janet McTeer (Elizabeth Woodville's mother) stole the show.

All said if I have to watch  historically implausible shows I prefer to stick withThe Game of Thrones.",1531526400,,1145,4.386792452830188
