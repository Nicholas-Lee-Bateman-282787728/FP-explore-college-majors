8336590,5,B001QVGLFU,"It's A Wonderful Leaf isn't about ""DW"" being shown what the world would be like without him, rather one of his archenemies, Bushroot, using his plant-like talents to brainwash natural Christmas trees into stealing every last Christmas present in St. Canard for his own selfish ends. Speaking of selfishness, Gosalyn, the adoptive daughter of ""DW""/Drake Mallard, tries all she can to open her presents early, while her wisecracking hero of a dad, shows her some important Christmas traditions, including giving presents. It's a wonder Disney never paired this with Goof Troop's own Christmas special, Have Yourself A Goofy Little Christmas, in 1 DVD, like they did many years ago on 1 videotape, sans theme songs for both shows. Though this standalone, bareboned disc is a Disney Movie Club exclusive, it's also found in the volume 2 DVD set of Darkwing Duck, be it the box set or new single-case packaging. It's up to you how you prefer to see this lesser-known Christmas classic, from a widely-renowned classic Disneytoon series that's still being largely talked about today, especially with toon legend Jim Cummings, the voices of ""DW""/Drake AND NegaDuck! Be it in this disc, or in volume 2 of Darkwing Duck, try and make It's A Wonderful Leaf a part of your own Christmas traditions, if you wish!",1440028800,2,1299,4.990783410138249
