4267711,5,B0046BI826,"I loved the first one, and i loved this one. I love violent car movies like this. It reminds me of the old twisted metal video games. Ving rhames was pretty good in DR2 though, so i enjoyed it very much.",1295222400,3,203,3.975609756097561
4267712,2,B0046BI826,"first i didn't bother reading the product description, i thought ""death race 2, sweet i'm gonna want to watch this"" i didn't know that it was a prequel. after that, sitting down to watch this i realized that most of the budget for this film must have went to getting Danny Trejo and Ving Rhames to appear in this movie. then just about the rest of the budget went to moving crews to unpack the props from the first movie. i mean almost everything is the same from the set to the cars, which would make sense in a prequel. but watching this movie you have to really wonder what did they spend money on? obviously not a descent script, just full of quick one liners, reminds me of earlier Schwarzenegger movies,(get to the choppa, i'll be back). no more than 3-4 words per line for anyone. then there was the special effects and camera work, every car here will explode under any kind of impact, don't get me wrong i'm a guy that likes to see stuff explode but there needs to be some sort of believe-ability behind it. the whole movie seems like it was cut and edited together by a highschool film club. scenes cut so randomly and quickly that the already extremely thin plot line is very hard to follow. several times during the movie i was lost and had to just kind of guess my way through it. all in all it was slightly entertaining seeing how frankenstein came to be, but it was just basically like re-filming the first movie with some minor changes. if you really liked the first movie and really need to see this one go ahead, i recommend watching the first one immediately after ""death race 2"" to get the taste of this sub par movie out of your mouth, i had to.",1295136000,6,1666,4.325878594249201
4267713,4,B0046BI826,"After a bank robbery goes bad Carl Lucas (Goss) gets sent to prison. The crime boss who sent him out (Bean) is afraid he will testify against him and sends in assassins to the prison to make sure he doesn't.  First of all, if you haven't seen the first ""Death Race"" I would start with that (you will get some of the call-backs), but I would say its more like the ""Star Wars"" prequels...you can watch in either order and it will still make sense.  I loved the first movie and was very leery about a direct to DVD prequel, but I was very surprised.  There were a couple characters from the first one, along with a few ""set-ups"" that happen in the original movie.  I would say this is more of an origin story, it explains the origins of the death race and the character of Frankenstein.  Most sequels/prequels are never as good as the original (especially direct to DVD ones), but this is a rare exception.  The first Death Race is still the better movie but this one holds up very well.  I give it a B+.",1295049600,13,1001,4.264550264550264
4267714,5,B0046BI826,"I'm not normally one for your typical boy racer action film but something about this movie just caught me from the word go!

Unlike alot of films in its genre it is driven as much by the characters and plots as by the epic battles and explosive races. Luke Goss carries the film flawlessly through from the dramatic beginning and into the emotional and cut throat gladiator type games of the Death Races.

A great story fantastically told and delivered. The only disappointment is that it was straight to DVD and not on the big screen where it so clearly belongs!",1294963200,5,563,4.564356435643564
4267715,5,B0046BI826,"I was lucky enough to be in the audience of the Toronto premiere of this film 1/10/2011 and DR2 BLEW ME AWAY!!!

FIRST - This movie was made as a PREQUEL to the movie with Jason Statham and this film is NOT about that character. Luke Goss plays Carl Lucas, Jason played Jensen Ames.

And as I have seen this I can tell you that it is absolutely FABULOUS!

It started fast and hard and I knew from that moment that we were all in for a heck of a film, and we were not disappointed!

The audience gasped and laughed, cheered and applauded. Luke Goss took you through the emotional transformation of Carl Lucas and made you feel it all!!

The effects and stunts made you lean toward the screen in anticipation and made you forgot that you were actually not a part of it.

The cast was perfectly chosen and the whole audience agreed that this film should have been a theater release!!

This movie is receiving much more positive reviews than negative... and MOST of the negative comes from people with preconceived ideas about it because it does NOT have Statham. Luke Goss is a STELLAR actor who did AWESOME in this movie. I HIGHLY recommend it and I can not wait for my pre-ordered dvd to arrive!",1294876800,18,1194,4.375565610859729

Like there is a pick up truck that had RPGs on top of it,sometimes would be shown with the RPGs and then 15 seconds later not have any then shoot an RPG 10 seconds later. But other then a few moments of miss filming, it was really cool.  It was kinda to similar to the first movie but it does have a lot of attractive chicks in it and has a lot of graphic deaths. Not the most realistic movie but it's a movie about prisoners that can some how drive like bad*** who don't have any drivng skills what's so ever before they go to prison,there just know for killing people not driving good.

4267775,4,B0046BI826,"Admittedly I love a good 80's action movie, so Death Race 2000 is among my favorites. Death Race didn't really live up to the original, though it boasted some pretty good kills and gave me my daily dose of Statham (and a Carradine cameo). I watched this one purely on a whim on Netflix, and backed by the star-power of Danny Trejo. I had just watched a double feature with some friends consisting of From Dusk til Dawn and Machete and was in a Trejo kind of mood. I wasn't expecting to like Luke Goss as much as I did in the lead. I'm not sold on the connecting story to Death Race, especially considering how its connected to 2000, but the story was surprisingly solid (when I say that consider what type of movie we're watching here folks), the action was non-stop and I dug the return to the old-school cars of 2000. I have added this one to my existing collection of 2000 and Death Race, and will watch it again.

4267783,3,B0046BI826,"Deathrace Two(released Jan/11)stars Luke Goss as Carl Lucas,Robin Shou as 14K,Tanit Phoenix as Katrina Banks,Lauren Cohan as September Jones,Fred Koehler as Lists,Ving Rhames as R.H. Weyland,
Danny Trejo as Goldberg,Sean Bean as Markus Kane,and others. Robin Shou and Fred Koehler are the only other two to appear from the first film,the rest are all newcomers to the franchise. The film lacks the spark and drive(sorry for the pun)that the first one had.
This story is a prequel to the first,so we see the genesis of the race itself. The first part of the movie deals with Death Match,the on going and current form of entertainment/fighting,run by Weyland. Before this we are intro'd to Lucas who is the go-to guy for a crime boss by the name of Kane. He dispatches his man to hit a bank. Lucas in turn hires three fellows he has worked with before,but before you can say""who shot the sheriff?"",things go south. While Lucas awaits out front two policemen happen to walk inside. His men ignore his radio call to abort the job. When the smoke clears security guards,the cops and one of Lucas' men are dead. A wild police chase ensues and Lucas gets caught. And of course Lucas will end up on....Terminal Island.
Kane is fidgety and thinks Lucas will out his involvement at some point. He hires several men to take Lucas out before he can ""rat"" him out. Inside Lucas gets his trial by fire and he is soon fist fighting in the Death Match. Weyland,the head of the entertainment company that runs the match itself,is having a problem with the ratings. His announcer/TV host Jones comes up with an idea. That germinates into action and the Death Race is born.
To start,there are twice as many drivers as there are cars. They run,punch and kill their way to the vehicles and the race goes from there. The first day three of the nine jacked up vehicles are eliminated. The second day starts out like the first,but Lucas's car gets into problems. He suddenly has no firepower,no defenses,nothing. His car has been sabotaged and one of his fellow racers fires a rocket which flips his car,burning him inside. Lucas comesthisclose to dying,but is saved. His being alive is kept secret so they can create a new character. Because his face has been disfigured due to the fire,they call him Frankenstein.
Because Lucas once saved the life of 14K,14K repays his debt by killing the man on Lucas' crew that sabotaged his car,and he has his boss Kane,killed on the outside. The film fades as we see Frankenstein/Lucas driving his car once more.
One thing I do insist upon in films is consistency,when possible. I found an appalling error in the film. It is with our first trip(shown overhead)over the bridge to Terminal Island. In the first film with Statham,it clearly showed a bridge protruding from the mainland,leading to the island which ran,at its terminus,to the bridges left. In this film we are clearly shown a bridge out to the island,which now runs to the bridges right. About halfway through the movie,first in schematics,then in overhead shots,they correct this discrepancy by showing it as it was in the first film. VERY sloppy. Goss has the lead here and that whole Statham look about him,but just not half his intensity nor apparent acting skills. It's always nice to see good old Danny Trejo,whose face could pass for the dark side of the moon(j/k Dan!).Ving Rhames I thought was the classiest looking and acting,of all the participants here. He really nailed his character. Watch for Danny Keough in a small part as the doc who saves Lucas' life. I recall well Keough as the corrupt cop in Van Damme's beautifully intense film,Wake of Death.
Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp in its w/s a/r of 1:78:1. Extras include deleted scenes,and several featurettes. This edition includes both the theatrical and the extended cuts.
All in all a let down from the first. Statham is certainly a hard act to follow,but with a so so plot,an obvious inconsistency,and nothing outstanding to make it shine as bright as the first,this one was just not going to be as good.",1361059200,,4072,4.7937411095305835

This is actually quite good and stays true to the events in the Death Race remake.

No plot spoilers from me: set in the near future where the federal prison system has been outsourced for profit to a private company that generates income from pay per view Death Fights and later the Death Race. The action centers on a convicted cop killer, Carl Lucas, that has decent fighting and great driving skills. This is not quite as good as ""Death Race"" and doesn't have the star power that Jason Statham brought, but it does have several characters from ""Death Race"" which adds a nice bit of continuity. The action was well paced and the special effects were on par with what I expected.

This was a very watchable action flick!

We see the origins of Terminal Island and the Frankenstein character also how the Death Race was started but unfortunately lead actor Luke Goss is no Jason Statham and the film is stolen by actress Lauren Cohan in a wonderfully evil performance.  With excellent back up by villainous turns of actors Sean Bean and Ving Rhames, and the always welcome Danny Trejo as a helpful inmate, the film holds together with slick action sequences and a taught back up storyline as Cohan glides the film to its explosive conclusion.  Universal provides a nice 1.85 transfer with good Dolby 5.1 sound and the usual making of extras.  With the gore and smashups poured on much more than the original and also Director Paul Bartel's Seventies original, the film is an entertaining bit of eye candy with relentless action from beginning to end, isn't that why we watch these films? It looks like Roger Corman may have another franchise brewing for I saw recently a trailer to 'DEATH RACE 3' which starts the saga anew in a different locale . I hope Cohan continues with her villainous perfs, she was excellent also as a female vampire in the television series 'VAMPIRE DIARIES' and has a substantial role in AMC's series 'THE WALKING DEAD'.  Her performance plus the high octane visuals are the only reasons to give 'DEATH RACE 2' a spin.",1346544000,2,1633,4.756183745583039

The remake is actually a pre-quel that shows how the Death Race was created and the origin of lead racer Frankenstein. ""Death Race 2"" offers up a pretty strong cast populated by many B-movie mainstays; Danny Trejo, Ving Rhames and Luke Goss. The film also features a great turn by Sean Bean as the mob boss!

The basic story is that the wheel man for a local mob boss gets nabbed after a botched bank robbery. He's sent to a prison the just so happens to stage fights to the death which are then shown on TV. Due to sagging ratings, the prison's owner and the Death Match producer begin looking for something new and exciting to offer. Soon Death Race is born and the prison has found it's new source of income.

With tons of slo-mo car crashes and explosions, gratuitous blood and nudity and some actual character development ""Death Race 2"" offers quite a bit for genre fans.

4267799,4,B0046BI826,"I thought with this being a direct to dvd movie that it would quite frankly suck.  But I was completely wrong. Based on the remarkable fact that this movie was shot on less than 1/10th the Budget of the original, this movie is very well done. And even though the Jason Statham film is superior, pound for pound, I enjoyed this one more. My only stipulation is that it be viewed in the Widescreen format. The regular TV screen format does not do it justice.

Now, had I known this movie was about the origin of Death Race Driver Frankenstein, I might have checked it out sooner.  But as it is, I happened to catch an episode of The Vampire Diaries (Episode 12: ""The Decent"")which featured Lauren Cohan (who plays September Jones in this Death Race 2).  She played a Vampire named Rose (Season 2: Episodes 9 through 12), and I was blown away by how charming/enchanting Lauren Cohan was in this particular episode. Her acting was impressive to me. So much so that knowing she was playing a major role, I decided to take a chance on purchasing this Death Race 2 movie.

Unfortunately, at first I couldn't find the DVD anywhere.  I had seen it all the time at Best Buy, but it had been out for over a year at that point, and now Best Buy didn't carry it anymore. I was going to see about getting it through Amazon, but when I saw it at Target, I bought it on the spot.  And I was not disappointed.

In a nut shell, this is a low budget film that plays more like a feature film.  From the Lead Character to the minor ones, the performances are top notch.  The story itself is very well written with characters that rise above what a low budget film normally has to offer. Taking into account it's rock bottom low budget, I would happily give this movie 4 out of 5 stars. But an honest and more frank assesment would have me giving it 3 to 3.5 stars (okay, maybe even 3.75 stars...yes, I liked it that much) when comparing it straight up with the Jason Statham film.

As far as for it's sequel, Death Race 3, I for one am excited to see what the future holds for the Frankenstein character.  And as a FAN, all I ask for is a few things.  Firstly, that they do not change the look of his iconic MASK, and that he continues to drive his Iconic MUSTANG. Frankenstein's Classic Mask, along with the Mustang ARE A MUST. That and as a driver, he has to continue being a TOTAL BAD ASS BEHIND THE WHEEL! Do you hear that ROEL REINE.  As a fan, those aspects are NON-NEGOTIABLE!

In closing, I must say that I can only imagine what Film Magic Roel Reine will be able to accomplish when provided with a decent movie budget.  I have no doubt that as a director, he is destined for great things.  My only regret is that for obvious reasons, the beautiful Lauren Cohan probably won't be in the sequel.",1327363200,,2781,4.286806883365201

A follow-up film was inevitable, but it was a bit surprising that it would be a direct-to-video prequel helmed by a director who had never worked in Hollywood. At first glance of its high production values, you'll wonder why it didn't make it into theaters, but unless you're content with the film giving up substance for style, you'll realize why soon enough.

The story: sent to the notorious Weyland penitentiary after a botched bank heist, Carl Lucas (Luke Goss,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blade-II/dp/B00011CZQU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blade II</a>) will first have to fight for his life in corporate-sanctioned death matches between prisoners and then race for his freedom when the brutal Death Race tournament is enacted.

This movie has a couple of good storytelling opportunities in chronicling both the manufacturing of its namesake and the ""birth of Frankenstein""  angle, but it disappoints on both accounts by dropping each into your lap. The titular race's creation is presented as nothing more than a bright idea of the villainous corporate entities (played well enough by Lauren Cohan of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Van-Wilder-The-Rise-of-Taj/dp/B000N3AW7A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Van Wilder - The Rise of Taj</a>&nbsp;and Ving Rhames of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pulp-Fiction/dp/1558908242/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pulp Fiction</a>) to spike the ratings of their pay-per-views - you don't even see the track or cars being constructed - and I can't help but feel as though the filmmakers were simply ripping off&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Revenge-of-the-Sith/dp/B00005JLXH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Revenge of the Sith</a>&nbsp;with how they built up the Frankenstein character, who doesn't even emerge until the last ten minutes of the film.

Director Roel Reine has been making a good name for himself on the DTV action scene, but this film's offerings aren't very inspired. For one thing, it features Danny Trejo (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Machete/dp/B002ZG98C8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Machete</a>) in its cast but he neither fights nor races. There are three of these races, but only two of them are actually Death Races and these don't happen until into the second half of the film. There's some decent stuntwork in each, but these scenes can't hold a candle to the original's: most of the time, the ""action"" is merely the camera swinging around while the cars are driving straight ahead. Very disappointing. About three hand-to-hand fights comprise most of the adrenaline pieces in the movie's first 50 minutes, and though the brawl between Luke Goss and Deobia Oparei (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doom/dp/B000CNER1S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doom</a>) is decent (they get to use flamethrowers), these also include the single worst fight that returning Robin Shou (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mortal-Kombat/dp/0790729997/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mortal Kombat</a>) has ever been in.

Considering that the film was made on only a $7 million budget, its production values are extremely high. Again, the movie *looks* like it should belong in theaters, and I'd be very surprised if director Reine didn't receive more lucrative offers in the near future. However, he overdoes things with dramatic slow-motion shots and sad music during the races: this is definitely not the movie for a ""what madness hath man wrought""-type moment. Nevertheless, the film is more solid than my previous words gave it credit for: the characters are hammy but do well in furthering the story, and I consider it pretty responsible of Roel Reine to focus predominantly on the plot when he realized the action may not be quite up to par. By no means does this prequel match&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-original/dp/B0038SUBEG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the original</a>&nbsp;or the version it's derivative of, but I have to give it credit for at least being competent...and for its admittedly awesome finale and the comeuppances of most of the major villains.",1308528000,2,4782,6.832786885245902

4267805,3,B0046BI826,"Despite its misleading title, ""Death Race 2"" is actually a prequel to Paul W.S. Anderson-directed ""Death Race"" released in 2008. For this new entry Anderson serves as a producer, and Roel Rein, whose CV includes Steven Seagal's straight-to-DVD movie ""Pistol Whipped,"" is hired as the director.

And here is the story. ""Death Race 2"" is an origin story of the first ""Frankenstein."" Carl Lucas (Luke Goss) is a professional getaway driver hired by a criminal kingpin Markus Kane (Sean Bean). After a botched bank robbery job, he is sent to Terminal Island, a prison run by The Weyland Corporation. There he is forced to join the ""Death Match"" show, which evolves into a more brutal ""Death Race"" show.

The story sounds familiar, but ""Death Race 2"" delivers what it sets out to deliver - car action and bone-crunching fights - though you don't see much originality in the film's recycled story and flat characters, and the prequel sometimes looks as if trying to copy the 2008 version. Car stunts are pretty impressive, but the camera is shaky and hectic, and perhaps the most disappointing thing is that the ""Death Race,"" for which the is made, does not start until about 50 minutes in.

Considering its budget which I think is much smaller than that of the original, ""Death Race 2"" did a decent job. But maybe this is because I saw the film with lower expectations.",1300147200,,1364,4.771186440677966

The main character is so much like Jason Statham that you wonder if its the same character with a different actor (it is a different character).  Aside from that, the other familiarities are forgivable.  The story set up pretty well and makes sense in an action movie way.  The actors are great - enjoyed seeing Danny Trejo and some of the others.  The women's prison ladies are hot and their involvement although not explicitly explained, makes enough sense.  The driving dynamics/expertise are sufficiently set up early in the movie to make sense why they get involved later, but thankfully you're well into the movie and enjoying the action before they evolve to the racing.

4267808,3,B0046BI826,"The original Death Race (2008) was directed by Paul W.S. Anderson, and made with a modest $45 million budget. It pulled in only $36 million in the US, and about $80 million worldwide, which would be just enough to cover the cost (remember, movie theaters get half of your ticket price). It was marketed as a remake of the original film, Death Race 2000 (1975), though Anderson has referred to it as more of a prequel. Apparently DVD sales were strong enough to warrant a sequel, but its straight-to-DVD nature really limits its scope. Several aspects of the plot are never made clear, the writing is really bad in spots, and it takes way to long to even get to the racing, especially when your movie has the word ""race"" in the title. Plus, most people are not going to be aware that this is actually made to be a PREQUEL to both original movies. But, it still is a somewhat enjoyable ride.

Luke Goss does a good job as the main character. He's a very likable character, and even though he's in prison for a good reason, there's enough development for him where you still root for him and don't want to see him hurt. Some of the action screens are fairly decent, but i really think that they're much better designed in the last Death Race (2008) movie. But what really hurts this movie is the pacing and writing. In fact, it takes just under 50 minutes for the movie to FINALLY mention the idea of even having a Death Race! That's half the runtime. Then 5 minutes later all of our characters are in there first race! There's absolutely no buildup to the racing: we never see the teams working on the cars, we never see them deciding the best weapons to use, they never explain the rules of the race, and the first time the get to their cars each one has an inmate from the woman's prison ward inside -- but the movie never gives a reason for this. We only see two races the during the last half of the movie, then we get a plot twist that may or may not sit well with the audience, an once things finally start to really get going -- bam, end credits.

I liked the main characters enough, but over half the movie doesn't even MENTION the idea of the Death Race concept, and by the time we get to see it, it hits you with an abrupt ending that lets you realize its actually a prequel. Even the writing is going to have you scratching your head a few times. I really recommend picking up the Death Race (2008) movie, and even the original, Death Race 2000 (1975). For both, the entire movie centers around the racing, the characters or more memorable, there are some decent action sequences, and they both leave you wanting more. And after that, then go ahead and get Death Race 2. I know, I just got done picking on it, but it really is still fun. The action isn't too bad, the main characters all have a reason for there motivations (minus one or two), and if all else fails -- it will make you want the watch the other two Death Race movies again.",1299456000,,2948,4.30990990990991

It starts off with death matches and when that starts to fizzle they decide to start Death Race.
It takes awhile to get to the actual racing but what precedes it is action packed and entertaining ,so much so you almost hope that it continues to stay with the death matches.

I love Danny Trejo and after seeing his full potential in Machete feel he was a bit wasted here,they could have expanded his character some.

But for what it was I thought it was very fun and entertaining. Like another reviewer said it reminded me of a real life ""twisted metal"" video game and it was also very much like running man in a way. That was a bunch of years back, last year Amazon had a super deal on the BR version so I bought it (which by the way, was a much sharper picture and much better sound than the original DVD but that's for another review). Anyways, I watched DR2 using Amazon VOD service last night and I was very satisfied. I don't think that DR2 was in any way better OR worse than the original DR movie. I think they were equal in story, acting, fx, and set. Some people complained that a lot of the same things were used in both movies. That seems kind of an unreasonable complaint to me since this movie is supposed to take place shortly before DR2 so not sure why everything would be expected to be different. You could literally watch DR2 and then DR without skipping a beat. Not many other prequels you can do that with and not be kind of turned off with the difference in film quality between the two. Danny Trejo did an amazing job, like always, and was a fitting prequel to Ian McShane who played ""coach"" in DR. There were a LOT of ties back to DR, not just with the set and cars, but with characters who make appearances in both, such as List and 24K, as well as other references to characters that you will meet later on in DR. I can't understand why people would love DR and think DR2 was such a disappointment. I'm kind of thinking they're going from their memory of DR, rather than a recent viewing of it. But everybody is entitled to their own opinions. I think if you found DR entertaining, you'll also find DR2 entertaining. If anything, I thought there was a little more ""fun"", more funny parts in DR2. For those that have seen it, the scene in the bar with the old warden at the end was hilarious! All praise aside, $26.95 is a RIDICULOUS PRICE for just about any BR movie. If this ever gets down to a more reasonable price, say <$15, for instance, then I will be sure to pick it up.

The characters were nice, some hot girls and cool cars, but it just didn't add up to the first one. It had some good scenes, like the girl getting out of the car and shooting the gattling gun herself. The main bad girl running the whole show was sexy and bad ass, as well as the main guy. I did enjoy it and will watch it again, but Death Race is no doubt way better and hotter, in every way out there. Just remember: It's still fun to watch even though Jason Statham and whoevers isn't in it... how can he be?",1295481600,,688,3.9568345323741005
4267821,3,B0046BI826,"Death Race 2 offers a decent amount of fighting and racing. The characters and storyline are for the most part ordinary. This movie is more like a game in which you care more about the weapons and maneuvers than the characters. The end of the movie is engaging and very well acted by Luke Goss.

The main character, Carl Lucas, is a contradiction. He walks the line between unbelievable and sympathetic. The female characters are insignificant to the story except to flash their breasts.

Luke Goss and Danny Trejo are the highlights of the movie. Danny Trejo's acting is so real you forget he's playing a part. The underlying emotions of Luke Goss's character are almost tangible. His performance makes Lucas human rather than a game character you don't care about. Goss and Trejo make this movie worth watching.",1295395200,,813,4.841726618705036

4267823,2,B0046BI826,"A prequel to Paul W.S. Anderson's surprisingly not bad 2008 remake of Roger Corman's B-movie classic Death Race 2000, Death Race 2 isn't the usual brand of the direct-to-home video awfulness that many would come to expect, boasting some decent production values and a relatively known name cast.  That being said, Death Race 2 isn't anything to write home about, and is nowhere near the guilty pleasure that Anderson's remake was either.  Luke Goss (Blade 2, Hellboy 2) plays a career criminal named Carl Lucas, who finds himself locked up in a corporate-controlled prison, where the televised fights to the death between prisoners (known as Death Match) gradually evolves into the Death Race we all know and love.  It isn't long before he's a marked man when his former employer (Sean Bean) puts a price on his head, all of which leads to the beginning of the creation of the legendary racer identity known as Frankenstein.  There's familiar faces from the first film around (Fred Koehler and Robin Shou reprise their roles) while Ving Rhames and Danny Trejo have small roles, and gorgeous babes Tanit Phoenix and Lauren Cohan provide the eye candy.  While Death Race 2 has a lot going for it, what kills the film are the uber-flashy edits that are just plain sloppy during the action scenes, as well as some at times atrocious acting, and a cliche'-ridden script that is way too predictable.  All in all, if you enjoyed Anderson's take on Roger Corman's Death Race the first time around, you may find something to admire with this prequel, however little that something may end up being.",1295308800,2,1589,4.845018450184502
4267824,5,B0046BI826,"So ONE: the movie was HOT, HOT AND HOT
And TWO: the movie was HOT, HOT, HOT, AND HOT AGAIN.

There was so much to the characters. You fell in love with theM. The possessed a lot of depth. The humor in the movie popped as well. The parts the were meant to be funny, WERE FUNNY, and nothing was contrived, out of place or awkward. The acting, the action, the romance between Carl and Katrina, was just simply natural.

Death Race II is a must see. Why not know the origins of Frankenstein?! It was tempting to see this movie either way because I wanted to see WHO Frankenstein was. HOW he was, how he ACTED. Everything!!!

Luke Goss was brilliant as always. An actor that deserves the recognition for his talent. Deserves great reviews and positive energy for what he does. I loved him in this movie. He made Carl Lucas feel real. As in all his movies, Luke Goss gives his characters that depth, meaning, and a real soul, it seems. =)
Ving Rhames and Danny Trejo were hilarious and great, and they just gave so much more to the movie and their roles.
Sean Bean gave me chills! He gave the movie that edge, that betrayal aspect so well!

It wouldn't really make sense to pass this movie up. Really.",1295308800,,1195,4.321428571428571
4267825,3,B0046BI826,"Let me just first say that I fully realize that this move, the 2008 movie with Jason Statham and the original Roger Corman flick are all 'B' grade movies and I judge them on that level. I am a fan of Mad Max / Road Warrior type movies and the recent Death Race movies have been the only movies in that Car Wars genre for quite some time. I disagree with most who say that this is surperior to the 2008 film. It's clear that this movie has been made with the leftovers from that movie. I was expecting new characters and new cars (save Frankenstein's Mustang) what we get it the same cars with vaguely analogous characters - Big Bill is no Machine Gun Joe, Sheik is no Reaper and so on. 14K is the only driver other than Frankenstein to be in both movies - it seems like we could have seen more of the track history of the drivers in the first movie. The scenes with Sean Bean were clearly shot separately and edited in, as he never seems to interact with others ... the same is almost true of Ving Rhames.

In short, I wanted more combat car action and I got less and the bit that I got wasn't as fast paced and thrilling as the 2008 movie.

Who knows, maybe this series of films has done well enough to make a third film (death race 3000?) that would actually be a remake of the original",1295308800,5,1288,4.127490039840637

8417174,2,B0046BI826,"As I have stated my case fully in my last review,  I enjoyed the first Death Race movie with Jason Statham thoroughly and in great abundance.  I ran into some trouble with this copy that I just bought from Amazon lately as I had the frustration of receiving a faulty Blu-ray.  So to finish watching this movie on Blu-ray, I borrowed a copy from my neighbor.  Thankfully they got me a new copy fast.  As it happens I heavily regretted even bothering as I was expecting far better out of this trainwreck than ever proved to be forthcoming.

Don't get me wrong this movie has its moments and a few enjoyable elements; but that's not saying a whole h*** of alot.

Here's what little was  admirable about this movie:

-It starred Hellboy 2's and Blade 2's Luke Goss.
-Luke Goss did a phenomenal job of acting
-Danny Trejo(Machete, Dead in Tombstone) was in it
-Danny Trejo's acting was great, he was funny at times, his pit crew mechanic character,Goldberg was cool, tough, and likable.
-The action at the beginning, the action during the Death Race races, and Luke Goss's fight choreography were awesome and fun to watch.
-There is tremendous eye-candy as once again there are some sizzling hot babes of whom later become Navigators for Death Race(especially the love interest Katrina played by super fine Tanit Phoenix), the evil and sociopathic September Jones(Lauren Cohen) was hot and gorgeous, and gangster Markus Kane(Sean Bean) had a smokin' hottie hanging around him.
-Big Bill was one stone cold villain.
-Finally the special effects for the action scenes were pretty decent.

With elements like those one would think that this would be an absolute winner.  Well that would be the case if not for the following:

Everything that proved unbelievably dreadful and totally without merit about this movie:

-For starters there is the main character of Carl ""Luke"" Lucas(Luke Goss).  Unlike Jason Statham's character Jensen Ames, Carl is a rough and tough criminal of whom is quite unlikable and as such is really tough to get behind or root for.
-Also he isn't very interesting or well developed as a character.
-The movie moves at a whelks pace for nearly an hour with seriously duller than watching cement dry, scenes of inmates walking around and threatening eachother, super boring scenes of sexy September having slow-paced business meetings with Weyland(Ving Rames) and other times with Warden Parks(Patrick Lyster) plus no real character development and very little action overall.
The few gore effects that were used were just terrible as they were obviously fake to the point of insulting.
-The slow-mo proved really annoying and cheapened some of the action scenes.
-Most of the characters are forgettable.
-September Jones was gorgeous, hot, and cold-calculatingly sociopathic but otherwise was a dull villain.  As she was just sexy, beautiful, and only got power over people with threats and manipulations, she had nothing on Joan Allen'e Warden Hennessey of whom was attractive, but she was also vicious, ruthless, pushy, alot more manipulative, cut-throat, and had ways of eliminating any inmate that she found worthless to her ratings and money making.  She was a far superior villain to September in every way that counted.
-The whole lead up to go from Death Match to Death Race was was too slow, plodding, and boring.
-The sex scene between Luke Goss and Tanit Phoenix wasn't sensual, was very rushed, and you never get to see any of Tanit nude sadly as Luke's body covered hers too much.  This movie is in fact constantly skipping around the female nudity to my disgust.  They can show men showering, but never show any female nudity except in side glance?!  WTF?!
-Once the action got started it was simply too little too late as the original Death Match show was as boring beyond words as was the first hour of this movie.  Even when some action came into play more there were still intermittent painstakingly slow and dull scenes even after the the hour mark.
-Carl Luca's(Luke Goss's) car accident was far too disturbing plus the darkly toned scenes of his looking like a p***-poor knockoff of Darkman plus with terrible makeup was just too much to have to bear.
-Finally Carl Lucas never fully redeems himself as a person in the end of the movie.  He's still unlikable at the end and still a menacing criminal.

SPOILER ALERT-  I will now say something about the ending.  If you haven't seen this movie than you might just want to skip this part of my review.

I get how evil, manipulative, power mad, and sociopathic/psychotic September Jones proved to be as a villain but the way that her death was handled was in just plain terrible taste.  It wasn't bad enough that her death should happen via Carl Lucas slamming her against the wall with his car but the drama to her death was too overt as if the filmmakers came were looking to make the audience feel sorry for her, Lauren's facial expression was corny, silly, and disturbing also and it just wasn't even necessary to film.  Furthermore, it neither makes sense how there is still a show to film without her, nor does it really make sense that Carl doesn't get thrown back in his cell for murdering her.  Even worse the movie ends without showing the 3rd race.  Seeing her bloody corpse was too sickening also. I get that the Warden and Weyland hated her for manipulating them and causing them to lose their jobs but their insulting words about her plus celebrating after seeing her gruesome death on tv were just plain callous and distasteful reactions and too soon also.  That whole death was done in completely poor taste and I would have rather that she had been shot or blown up instead and with less graphic details.  Despicable ending entirely!!!
  END OF SPOILER

All in all, this movie is just inexcusable crap.  The action is infrequent, there's very little humor, the gore effects are garbage,while the action and special effects are pretty good at times other times the explosions are too delayed and don't look that great, the slo-mo is poorly done, over-used and is too cheapening to the scenes plus too distracting, the fight choreography is excellent, some of the performances are good, sadly there's very little charm, not much character development, one dull scene of yakking about nothing much and dull as mud scenes of people talking business after another, seriously edited female nudity that even the extended version doesn't offer anything to fix that, the extended version only gave the movie 2 more measly minutes and nothing special came from that, a totally unlikable main character that never finds redemption at the end, and one of the worst and most horrifying unsettling endings.  If you enjoyed the first Death Race movie, then you will likely see the clear and present step down that this chapter totally proves to be.  Only useful as a necessary evil to the far better and improved part 3(of which I will review soon) and for the back story on the earlier Death Match leading to Death Race as well as the origin on the original Frankestein.  A colossal failure!!! 1 star out of 10!!!!",1504742400,,7099,4.826732673267327
