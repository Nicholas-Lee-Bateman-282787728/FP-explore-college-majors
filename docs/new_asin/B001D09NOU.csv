8290637,4,B001D09NOU,I have had the pleasure of viewing this point blank documentary. It is not your usual reenacted shock video that you come to see on this subject. It basically offers actual people telling their stories of events that they witnessed in person along with a story line fill in by the producers. No claims are made as solid evidence and they leave conclusions to the viewer. The stories are remarkable to hear first hand and overall this was a fun film to watch.,1299801600,,458,4.530120481927711
8290638,5,B001D09NOU,"Bart's film (made by Grendel Films) is an excellent one; and as you will guess from its title, is a study of a diabolical beast that roams the thick and dark woods of Kentucky.

The Dogman is one of Bart's particular interests, and we follow him on his quest for the truth about the creature as he seeks out interviewees (including various eye-witnesses and author Linda Godfrey), undertakes on-site investigations, and takes us on a road-trip into the unknown.

The film is packed with superb data, illuminating testimony and more that will be of great interest to fans of cryptozoology, werewolves and strange beasts everywhere.

Bart's story is very much a personal one (his mother discusses her own encounter on-screen), and one filled with enthusiasm, a passion for the subject matter, and some stunning revelations on the Dogman, the Beast of the Land Between the Lakes, and the Spottsville Monster.

Definitely highly recommended!",1232496000,5,937,5.104575163398692
8290639,5,B001D09NOU,"This is one intriguing piece of documentary filmmaking. John Johnsen (Grendel Films) is a veteran producer/director/cinematographer/videographer of nature films and has taken viewers who generally don't know his name on many excursions into the back country to see the lives and behavior of bears, cougars,elk, and all manner of woodland creatures; all  of the recognized,scientifically named and catalogged,academically-approved-of
types of fauna. Now,officially in retirement, though, Johnsen has begun stepping out of the ""factual parameters"" set by scientific orthodoxy and headed off in the ""Monsterquest"" direction.
Collaborating initially with Marlon (M.K.) Davis,the photo analyst who has done so much on the 1967 Patterson-Gimlin Bluff Creek bigfoot film footage, he launched Grendel Films with a documentary short on Davis and his bigfoot work.
Then he met a writer-woodsman-Fortean researcher from western Kentucky named Bart Nunnelly and documentary project number two was soon up and going. This time the subject was NOT something anthropologically debatable, but, rather, something just plain WEIRD. Yet this something weird came as anecdotal accounts of strange encounters across parts of the U.S. by average Americans, common folk,who avow doggedly to have seen
things that are just NOT supposed to be.
We are essentially talking what seem like ""were-creatures"" here, and entering the realm of Linda Godfrey's books ""The Beast of Bray Road"" and
""Hunting the American Werewolf"". Fortean strangeness. We encounter here two folkloric Kentucky ""monsters"" (neither of which is Bigfoot); the ""Spottsville Monster"" of Henderson County, which terrorized the Nunnelly family in the 1970s, and the ""Beast of the LBL"" (Land Between the Lakes), another ""something"" that has a legend trailing back to the days of Daniel Boone and which may---MAY----have slaughtered a family of campers in Kentucky in the early 1980s.
Johnsen's movie features Bart Nunnelly (author of the Amazon-available book ""Mysterious Kentucky""), covering old ""stomping grounds"" where his Spottsville beast once roamed, a Nunnelly ex-neighbor (now a minister) who well remembers his own sightings of this terrifying  creature (as well as shimmery ""portals"" where it may have intermittently entered and exited OUR version of ""reality""), writer-researcher Linda Godfrey, speaking of ""wolf things"" in general, and paranormal researcher Jan Thompson, giving a harrowing recounting of her own run-ins with what may well have been the infamous
LBL beast.
There are no fancy graphics in this documentary, no CGI, and no ""Unsolved Mysteries""style re-enactments. What there IS are people telling their stories. Powerfully. Effectively. This is a very good piece of indie documentary filmmaking on a shoestring. Give it a look. I think you'll be surprised.",1231545600,7,2820,5.727923627684964
8290640,5,B001D09NOU,"The Wild Photographer has put together a great documentary.  This video is a great compliment to B.M. Nunnelly's book Mysterious Kentucky, which can be found on Amazon as well.  Join John (Wild Photographer) as he films B.M. Nunnelly while interviewing Linda Godfrey (my absolute favorite author), researcher Jan Thompson, and B.M. Nunnelly's mom. This was filmed in the beautiful land between the lakes, a national recreation area in Kentucky with some good scary tales.  In addition, John is a nice guy who has a passion for the unknown.

If you are into cryptozoology or just like a scary tale, buy it!",1231545600,3,631,4.915094339622642
