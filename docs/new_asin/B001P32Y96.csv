8331901,2,B001P32Y96,"THIS DVD WAS INTERESTING HISTORICALLY AND OF COURSE HAD  BEAUTIFUL SCENERY IN THE FOREST, BUT THE FOREST IS MANAGED BY KILLING THE ANIMALS TO KEEP THE POPULATION IN CHECK  I ORDERED THIS AS A GET AWAY TO A LOVELY FOREST, NOT TO SEE KNOCKING SMALL ANIMALS IN THE HEAD.  ITS EDUCATIONAL IF YOU HAVE A FOREST TO MANAGE, WHICH I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO DO, SINCE I DONT ENJOY KILLING SMALL ANIMALS OR CUTTING DOWN TREES.  I REALIZE THIS IS WHAT MUST BE DONE, THEORETICALLY , BUT ITS CERTAINLY NOT WHAT I EXPECTED AFTER READING THE DESCRIPTION OF THE DVD.  THANKS  JO ANN KUHN",1371340800,3,568,4.3619047619047615
