8359734,5,B002ALJPR6,"I love the work outs and the way they challenge me. It comes with a set of 3.  The 1st demonstrates how the Wave should be used. The 2nd is a 30 min. workout, it is my favorite due to my schedule. The 3rd  is a 45 min work out which I do when time permits.  However, I will be making the time to do the 3rd one. It's a great way to subsidize my workouts with my personal trainer on my off days.",1383782400,5,394,3.6666666666666665
