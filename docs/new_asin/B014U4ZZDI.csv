very well made
a very plausible plot
intense and visually disturbing,

7424855,5,B014U4ZZDI,"Destined to become a horror film cult classic. A couple move into a condemned building. The squatters who live there are covered in sores, lice, and are pretty disgusting characters as the garbage and waste in the building has  produced a virus that turn the tenants into infected scabby people who kill. There are more scenes of blood and guts, puss oozing sores that one has ever seen in a movie. Director Gesner lets it all hang out and ignores boundaries other film makers have succumbed to in this, his debut film. But that's what the horror buffs want and demand, more blood and guts, and he gives it to as no one else can. Dylan Penn makes her film debut, co-starring with Ronan Rubinstein in this over the top movie. Definitely go see it, even if you aren't a horror buff. It may not be your thing, so bring a barf bag if you must, but this is cutting edge film making and done very well.",1447632000,5,896,4.365269461077844
7424856,3,B014U4ZZDI,"Maya (Dylan Penn) leaves her unhappy white bread suburban home to live with Dante (Ronen Rubinstein) a long distant boyfriend in NYC. To her dismay, Maya finds out her new home is a condemned apartment building which contain an odd assortment of characters. The drains all seem to run to an open basement, which includes chemicals used for making drugs. Residents have large puss sores that grow and cause hallucinations, turning the building into a cage match of mutants.

The characters on the surface are odd and interesting enough, expect for maybe Maya, the main character. In spite of all the excitement and blood, and special effects, I felt board by a plot we have seen under various situations. Supermodel Lydia Hearst, the great-granddaughter of publishing scion William Randolph Hearst plays a junkie.

7424858,1,B014U4ZZDI,"It's a shame that we are now in third and fourth rate carbon copies of horror movies based off other horror movies. Romero's zombie movies begat a hundred other zombie movies of varying quality and degrees competence. If we are fortunate, an original take comes along like 28 days later. Then we get a variation on THAT [REC]!

So here we have Condemned, a zombie/virus, trapped victims XEROX that has subpar effects, pacing and acting.  Do you need to watch a horror film that is a combination of Night of the Living Dead, [REC], Street Trash and Return of the Living Dead?  Why horror fans continue to watch variations of movies they've already seen 100 times is beyond me - but hell, I'm part of the problem - I rented it!

7424862,4,B014U4ZZDI,Good old fashioned zombie virus flick. No found footage to be seen in this movie. Though the budget was on the smaller side i really liked this movie. I liked the idea of telling the story through the various residents of the condemned building and seeing how sickness effects everyone differently.,1456963200,,298,4.862745098039215

7424864,3,B014U4ZZDI,Yes I enjoyed Condemned. It reminded me of the 1980's movie Street Trash witch is also a good film. Condemned as good actors and good effects.,1456012800,,142,4.5
7424865,2,B014U4ZZDI,I personally felt it was pretty corny and the effects just didn't appear realistic. Not much of a story either.,1454976000,,111,4.6
7424866,3,B014U4ZZDI,"This is one of those movies that I actually liked.....but will never admit to anyone I watched.

7424867,3,B014U4ZZDI,"If you like gross-out, disgusting movies, you will love CONDEMNED!  But, with that said, the actors are all pretty good, the story is decent if not a bit predictable. It's the nasty, disgusting bodily fluids, etc.., that star in this movie.
People are living in a condemned building and through the drains, some pretty nasty, gross things are being poured and they begin to infect all the occupants of the building, making them hallucinate, kill but more importantly, adding their own brand of disgusting symptoms to the mix!",1454284800,,525,4.965909090909091

7424870,5,B014U4ZZDI,"I had terrible expectations for this movie and was then pleasantly surprised. Yea, it was low budget and it wasn't going to be a hit based on big names because it has none but it was very good. It should be sold for $9.99 or less but you can throughly enjoy this movie either way. Dylan Penn is super gorgeous and surprisingly makes this movie somewhat believable. She does this with the help of the cast around her and a solid script. The movie runs along at a steady pace and has enough scary moments to keep you engaged and even entertained. Video and audio quality are very good and showcase the setting very well. I thought the special effects were up to par for 2015. Could they be better? Yes, but for the budget and such they are more than adequate! Based on my expectations, entertainment value and Dylan Penn I give this 5 stars. If it was $25.00 and supposed to be a blockbuster then I would feel differently!",1453075200,,920,4.385964912280702

7424872,3,B014U4ZZDI,"Condemned is basically a gross out movie! It's about people living in an abandoned apartment building. It has a crazy cast of characters that consist of  junkies , a sassy Transvestite and a pumped up looking (Johnny Messner) as a gay sadist who has his partner\masochist on a dog collar. To name a few.

If you're grossed out by bodily fluids, boils or anything of that nature, you will probably hurl. Although I've seen much more disgusting movies. This does have somewhat of a Troma fee but even though the effects weren't the best, they are better than most of the Troma films.

It was pretty entertaining but nothing special. There were a couple of bloody gore effects that were pretty cool .But most of the ""appeal"" is in the characters and their  crazy antics.

There's also a crazy Asian meth dealer who has a meth lab in the building. All the insanity starts when chemicals from the lab go down the main water pipes combined with puss,vomit and other unspeakable body fluids creating a toxic mix that turns people into Rabid killers with no reasoning..",1452297600,,1061,4.682795698924731
7424873,3,B014U4ZZDI,"I love splatter films and punk rock. This one was shot too dark, had too many characters established to be significant to the plot that wind up being expendable and visa-versa, too much digital blood (really sucks the fun out of an FX-heavy flick, people), and fails at most of its attempts to be comical. Still; I love me a good ol seedy inner-city squat/meltdown movie. Reminded me a bit of the film ""Murder Party"". A great deal of potential without enough pay-off.",1451952000,,467,4.63855421686747
7424874,4,B014U4ZZDI,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

Ive always prided myself on the fact I don't pay attention to outside reviews whenever I decide to watch a movie.  Im glad I dont, tooif I had let reviews sway me, I would have missed out on some GREAT films.  Todays movie, CONDEMNED, is a perfect example.  After I watched the film, I went to IMDB and Amazon to check out what others thought.  Interestingly, opinion is pretty split.  But for me, I really enjoyed it.  Granted, its a scenario weve seen before, but the execution of the film is pretty tight, and theres plenty of carnage for gore-hounds.  If you're looking for a grosstastic good time, then check out this film for sure.

As I mentioned, weve seen this situation in other films before, such as REC and QUARANTINE.  But Ive always said, if a filmmaker or author can make an existing premise entertaining, then Ill gladly give it a look.  Such is the case here.  While not perfect, this movie is entertaining and good, gory fun.

CONDEMNED is shot fairly well and looks pretty decent onscreen.  My sole complaint about the cinematography is that some of the shots are too dark.  I would have preferred some moody, atmospheric lighting in these scenes, but instead we get darkness, and therefore the intensity lightens because we cannot see what is happening.

The acting is so-so, with a mish-mash cast of decent and meh actors.  I understand this is the film debut of Sean Penns niece, Dylan Penn, and she does a decent enough job.  The rest of the characters are portrayed in an over-the-top fashion, and I cant decide if this was done to be comedic or intentional.  Either way, some of the performances are pretty good, while others just get annoying.

The special effects in CONDEMNED are exaggerated and outrageous, and they are a big part of what makes the movie so much fun.  While watching some of the vomit-inducing splatter, I was reminded of such film classics as Peter Jacksons DEAD ALIVE and Ruggero Deodatos infamous CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST.

CONDEMNED doesnt bring anything new to the table, but its still a fun film to watch, and I recommend it.  Chocked full of gore, colorful characters, and crazy situations, this is a film you won't soon forget.  The film hits store shelves tomorrow, so make a note.",1451865600,,2303,4.6716417910447765
7424875,1,B014U4ZZDI,"I am with Martha S Jones. Dreadful. I hate to even give it 1 star. I have to clarify and say I love bad gory movies... I will sit through anything, once.  But this.  We stopped it a little over halfway, we just couldn't stomach it anymore. It wasn't the gore or slime or puking... it was the acting and the plot. People giving this 4 stars evidently do not know what makes a great movie.  None of that, was in this. I would ask for a refund, but know it's my own fault for watching it.",1451520000,,485,3.979381443298969

8731859,2,B014U4ZZDI,"It reminds me of a knock-off version of ""Night of the Demons"", and it's not nearly as great. This is a REALLY gory gross movie. A lot of people throwing up too (yuck). The entire condemned apt complex looks gross and it makes for a creepy atmosphere even though the movie itself isn't scary. It's actually pretty ridiculous but I don't think it was made to be serious. I've seen worse acting in other movies and there were a few likable characters. There was something about it that made me want to see what happens at the end.",1517875200,,527,4.387755102040816

We start with the rich girl maya moving in with her boyfriend in a condemned building where things don't work so all the garbage, feces and pee and assorted drug concoctions that fly down the drains are all just festering in the building and changes the residents. totally predictable but the characters are a very odd assortment. This is a very darkly lit movie and in very close quarters. I will recommend it to those who love gore and violence and it can get pretty gross at times.",1492732800,,762,4.9147286821705425
8731862,3,B014U4ZZDI,"The first 20 minutes were good. I read quite bad reviews about the film and didn't expect much, so I was pleasently surprised about the first part of it, but then it seemed as if the instructor and producer ran out of funds and it became too much of a B movie. I hoped for something disgusting and am probably too used to horrormovies in order to become easily grossed out.
With a larger fund the movie could have been great, but without it, it's just an ok B-horror movie about some chemical substance that drives everyone sick, mad and on a killingspree a la ""Rec"".",1491004800,,567,4.3584905660377355
