4284574,5,B0047CTO90,"While it would be difficult to call this relatively minor Masterpiece Contemporary film great movie-making, I think it would be impossible to watch it and not be smiling virtually all of the way.  The premise is a simple one;  a water leak at the National Gallery in London threatens to damage many of the invaluable works of art.  The Curator decides that the National must be emptied of its paintings until the water leak is found and repaired.  The paintings are carefully boxed and taken to a remote village in Wales to be placed in a former underground slate mine.  Of course, the sight of many large trucks winding through their mountainous Welsh village arouses the interest of the townspeople.  There is no great intrigue or mystery here but the movie is eminently watchable because of several things;  first are the performances of the two lead characters, Trevor Eve as the curator, and Eve Myles as the somewhat eccentric schoolteacher at the one room schoolhouse in the little village of Manod.  There are also fine performances by some child actors.  There are surely many less pleasant ways to spend an hour and a half.  A nice, happy, romantic ending, although a bit improbable, is still a satisfying one.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Masterpiece-Contemporary-Framed/dp/B0047CTO90/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Masterpiece Contemporary: Framed</a>",1294617600,19,1399,5.525821596244131
4284575,5,B0047CTO90,"This Masterpiece Contemporary presentation was such a nice surprise.  It tells the tale of a small Welsh village and how art affects the human condition.  ""Framed"" is a sweet, heartwarming story, enhanced by the presence of Eve Myles(""Torchwood""), who is a gem.  The many strands of the story are deftly woven together, and the whimsy and life-lessons go hand-in-hand with one another, making this an altogether enjoyable film.",1293494400,36,427,5.25
4284576,5,B0047CTO90,"A fantastic movie.  A delightful story and wonderfully done.  As a fan of the Welsh accent, I thoroughly enjoyed this, listening to the wonderful accents.  And you can never go wrong with Eve Myles :-)",1432166400,,201,4.685714285714286
4284577,2,B0047CTO90,Loved the book and book on CD. We were disappointed with the movie.,1431043200,,67,4.230769230769231
4284578,4,B0047CTO90,Nice little gem of a movie.,1430006400,,27,3.6666666666666665
4284579,4,B0047CTO90,Very nice story in an area not often viewed by the public.,1424131200,,58,3.9166666666666665
4284580,1,B0047CTO90,"Very slow, boring, didn't even finish it. I love British stories. Premise sounded like Doc Martin. Not even close. Glad I didn't spend too much on it.",1419292800,,150,4.592592592592593
4284581,5,B0047CTO90,"I loved this story on Masterpiece Theatre and had to purchase it.  We've watched it three times.  Great story line, really great acting and it just goes to show you that young people and family can save the day when everyone works together and puts their own talent in the mix",1417219200,,276,4.392156862745098
4284582,3,B0047CTO90,"Cute, endearing little people movie of the sort the British do so well. I quite enjoyed it. Good, solid story.",1417132800,,110,4.55
4284583,5,B0047CTO90,"Eve Myles is beautiful, Trevor Eve is stogy, other characters are quirky and troubled, the plot is questionable, the story is funny, uplifting, wonderfully filmed and directed and thoroughly enjoyable. Life should work out this way ... sammy",1416873600,,241,5.368421052631579
4284584,5,B0047CTO90,Interesting story line.  I have always liked Trevor Eve.,1412899200,,56,5.222222222222222
4284585,5,B0047CTO90,What a sweet movie.  Have watched it twice already.,1406505600,,51,4.666666666666667
4284586,5,B0047CTO90,"Couldn't wait to find out what would happen with the main characters. I saw the production on TV and had to have the DVD. The story has several sub stories, a family in crisis, an art museum in trouble, several characters who can't seem to communicate their real feelings. Comes together at the end, but left me wondering why there was not a continuation of the story for a more satisfying ending.",1402272000,,397,4.527777777777778
4284587,4,B0047CTO90,"I had not heard of this movie before I bought it but I love British film and gave it a try. The way we can sometimes close ourselves off and become obsessed with an interest is well played in this film. And then life happens and throws chaos in our road. The characters have a great banter throughout the film and the main character finally finds that his life isn't over and sometimes putting yourself out there, though scary has its own rewards.",1393804800,,447,4.397590361445783
4284588,5,B0047CTO90,"I knew nothing about this movie, but it sounded like it would be good so I took a chance and got a used copy.  It's really cute, and seems like, although contemporary, it belongs among classic movies such as ""The Railway Children"".",1391558400,,231,4.5
4284589,4,B0047CTO90,A sweet movie that charms and entertains.  It's nice to see Trevor Eve in a lighter role than he usually plays and Eve Myles away from the Torchwood/Dr Who universe.,1390608000,,165,4.5
4284590,5,B0047CTO90,Has some interesting twists.  The kids are well played.  A different type of story line. Interesting facts about the war times.,1389312000,,127,5.0
4284591,4,B0047CTO90,"Saw this late night on tv back when my cable service actually provided art and entertainment.  Filmed locally with a story unique to the Welsh countryside, I just really enjoyed being exposed to a part of earth that I really know nothing about other than biographies I've read about Richard Burton.  Starring Torchwood's Eve Myles, which is why I decided to watch it in the first place.  She's wonderful on Torchwood and terrific here, too.  The rest of the cast I am not at all familiar with but the other lead, Trevor Eve, is also very, very good.  I wish more Americans would find a way to expose themselves to other cultures and this is a dandy way to do it even though it's a piece of fiction, you will learn something about time, another place, and another people.",1383350400,,770,4.510791366906475
4284592,5,B0047CTO90,A really fun time will be had by all.  This romp with the star of Heat of the Sun is good for a viewing over and over.,1379808000,,118,3.3703703703703702
4284593,5,B0047CTO90,"except murder, bad language, nudity, angst. Still it's a pretty wild ride,clever as heck .  It's a fun ride for the whole family and a departure from the ordinary doom and gloom. It will leave you warm and fuzzy and smiling.",1377648000,3,224,4.463414634146342
4284594,2,B0047CTO90,"One wants to like this movie.  It's clean, wholesome, family-oriented, and has beautiful scenery and excellent actors. But it's a flop, in large part of the utterly absurd plot.  This might have been a good juvenile book, but one looks for much more in a film, especially one that appeared on Masterpiece Theater.  It's all goo, silliness, and cutesy slop--just barely tolerable.  Oh, those smart, articulate little kids.  Oh, that old duffer being drooled over by the hot pants school teacher.  Oh, the husband of the kids who runs away and is found in London by the duffer and returned to his financially bankrupt family.  And so on.  Put it on the Disney Channel where it belongs.",1372896000,2,683,4.777777777777778
4284595,5,B0047CTO90,Trevor Eve heads an outstanding cast in this offbeat story based on fact about saving valuable artwork from possible destruction.  All the characters are engrossing and the script is terrific.,1365811200,,192,5.4
4284596,4,B0047CTO90,"Trevor usually plays a stronger role but a little bite of romance is also good...
It's a real feel good story.",1365206400,,110,4.285714285714286
4284597,5,B0047CTO90,I saw this movie on our local PBS station and wanted to share it with friends so they could also enjoy it.,1361145600,,106,3.8636363636363638
4284598,5,B0047CTO90,"This story is unique and adorable.  Trevor Eve leaves behind his gruff, antagonistic characters he usually plays for a man who is very passionate about his ART. The villagers are quirky and fun to watch also.",1354233600,,208,4.777777777777778
4284599,5,B0047CTO90,"You'd have to have a pretty hard heart not to enjoy ""Framed,"" one of those whimsical, old-fashioned romances where an outsider comes through happenstance to a picturesque little town, only to find love he never knew he was missing.  Trevor Eve is Quentin Lester, a stuffy sort despite his generally laid-back but upscale appearance (think TV's Frasier if he wasn't so often an ass) and who also happens to manage London's National Gallery.  A convenient problem occurs requiring Lester to undertake a hare-brained plan to save priceless works of art and involves said small town and a network of forgotten caves.  Of course it's really just the excuse to get Lester to meet Angharad Stannard (Eve Myles), a Bohemian, bookishly sexy schoolteacher, the sort of kind and genuine spirit one can't help but fall in love with.  There is the requisite collection of harmless eccentrics and also a family, the Hughes, whose struggles are at times a bit cloying, though the youngest daughter, Minnie, is played with such kinetic alacrity that she makes up for it.  I found myself rooting for Lester and Angharad -- the trouble with most romances is that I don't really care much for the people involved, but these two characters, as well as the actors playing them, are winningly sympathetic because they are such appealing people.  And while some people may criticize the television production for being too ""light,"" sometimes we need an antidote from the tribulations of real romance, where compromises and disappointments can take their toll.  Here, true love rises above petty self interest, and that's not just entertaining, it's soul affirming.  True love, it seems, does conquer all.",1337990400,3,1681,5.065217391304348
4284600,5,B0047CTO90,"I've seen this film a few times and decided it was time to buy it.  It is a little unrealistic, but I love the message of how art can touch our lives and that anyone can appreciate it.  This film always brings a smile to my face and I love the main actress, she's brilliant! Stodgy art curator + free spirited teacher + kids with their own schemes = a delightful little comedy with a great ending.",1323129600,3,397,4.142857142857143
4284601,2,B0047CTO90,"Oh, how sad.
This film is so 'blurg' that I actually stopped watching in the middle (a rare thing for me).  I am a true Masterpiece Theatre fan even after they splintered things up into their three little nifty categories, ""Classic"", ""Mystery"" and ""Contemporary"".  However if things go the way of ""Framed"" I will no longer be watching.

This was so incredibly trite - montage-methods going back to bad TV movies and holiday Hallmark specials, plot leaps, adults becoming enamored and soften by the oh-so bright children, country school marm who knows so much more about art than the curator of an international museum, silly background music to tell you that something is supposed to be ""cute"" or funny....oh - should I go on.....?

Probably not.

If you like Disney family movies, you'll love it.  If you like Masterpiece Theatre, you'll hate it.

4284603,1,B0047CTO90,"Did I enjoy this movie?  Yes.

Did I enjoy it more when I saw the deleted 8 minutes? Yes. For example, PBS cut out a scene where the father tries to explain to the son why he is leaving.

PBS cuts down programs to fit the current 90 minute slot for Masterpiece.  I understand this, and I accept it.  When PBS negotiates the rights to release the program on DVD, the DVD only includes the footage that was shown on Masterpiece (rather than the whole program).  I don't understand this.  PBS does this a lot.  They cut 40 minutes from Any Human Heart.  This practice stinks, and people should know that they are not getting the entire program despite purchasing the DVD at full price.

I give this DVD only one star because of the missing footage.",1299542400,34,745,4.372262773722627
4284604,5,B0047CTO90,"Excellent, excellent, excellent contemporary romantic comedy entertainment!  Creative storyline and beautiful, contrasting landscapes, the usual wonderful craft of the actors, amazing attention to detail and lighting, perfect length and tempo. Purchased it for myself and as fun gifts for a couple of friends who are alwaqys looking for fun but intellectually interesting family entertainment with appeal for young and old, and they loved it. AND HOW WONDERFUL - NO VIOLENCE!",1299110400,7,475,5.785714285714286
4284605,5,B0047CTO90,"I saw this film unexpectedly on PBS on Christmas Eve and it instantly became a favorite. I was thrilled to be able to purchase the DVD on Amazon. As a sucker for all things Welsh and Art, this film spoke to me on many levels. The writing and acting are first rate. The characters are gloriously eccentric and very human. A lovely, gentle comedy that can't help but make the viewer feel good. Nothing grim, violent or depressing here!",1294704000,12,433,4.493670886075949
