8245245,5,B0012DUCOI,It was really good. Would love to see more like it.,1413676800,,51,3.727272727272727
8245246,2,B0012DUCOI,"This short video doesn't even begin to do this park justice.  It omits most of the history, geology, and even wonderful features of the park.  This is one of the few national parks that we never lived near yet visited more than once--it's actually awesome.  It's also a park we accidentally discovered by simply driving through the area.

The video presents it as a dry rocky landscape of fairly bland nature, along with the same bad music and bland narrative.  It does at least show SOME of the features of the park, even if it isn't much.

It never mentions the falls on the river that go from popular recreation location with a natural stone water slide to a giant water gun at flood stage, nor the remnants of the old orchards from the Mormon settlements that now provide fruit for intoxicated deer as they fall.  (Wino deer are not a pretty sight!)

There isn't much competition for videos on many parks, and Capitol Reef is one.  Just be aware that this park has a LOT more to offer than the video even mentions.  This video is also outdated in both technology and manner, leaving the viewer rather dissatisfied with it.",1407456000,,1126,4.557213930348259
8245247,1,B0012DUCOI,"This is strictly for some random views of the Park, with no explanation of the geology or the layout.  It mentions Fruita, but doesn't bother to show it!  It doesn't show the Golden Throne or the Capitol Dome.  I think the camera crew just followed one portion of the highway near the Visitors Center.  Also, the color is badly off.  It's comparable to an article in one of the useless travel magazines these days:  some pictures, useless article, and leaves you wondering what the fuss is about.  This Park is magnificent.  You'd never know it from this video.",1407024000,,561,4.653061224489796
8245248,2,B0012DUCOI,"Three criticisms:
1. The narrator didn't explain the phenomenon of Waterpocket Fold.
2. $3.00 for ten minutes!
3. Cheesy coloration.",1328227200,,132,5.65
8245249,1,B0012DUCOI,"When the name of the park is misspelled on the cover of the DVD, I have grave doubts about the quality of the product within.",1317686400,,125,4.04
