Your not gonna learn anything by sitting and watching this DVD people..... Let's face it,  nothing compers to really world training! This guys just trying to make a quick buck.

8628928,5,B00H04GEDQ,"Having been involved in Executive Protection for about 2 years, I am a sponge when it comes to training. I have known Ken by reputation on the Facebook networking sites, and he seems to know his craft. I was pleased when I found out he had done a series of DVDs about Executive Protection. Being that the Advanced Security Detail is the most important aspect of protection, I picked up both of his DVDs on the subject. Although I knew a little about the topic, he had some good ""real world"" insights into this important duty. I conducted my first solo EP detail in October, and I was glad that I purchased these DVDs. The detail went off without a hitch, and i owe that in part to these DVDs. Not a substitute for actual hands on training, but a good supplement to the training.",1399766400,,778,4.372413793103449
