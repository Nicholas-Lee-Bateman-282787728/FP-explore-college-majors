8285918,5,B001C3ZMSO,Great series. I took the risk on buying this Trilogy because Alex O'loughlin was in BlackJack Sweet Science. Despite the fact that it is only in the PAL format I felt it was worth the purchase price and I would be able to find a way to view it.  As it turns out the PAL format DVD will actually play on a Macbook Pro Computer.,1247529600,8,326,4.015384615384615
8285919,5,B001C3ZMSO,"I bought this trilogy because BlackJack: Sweet Science stars Alex O'Loughlin.  I was NOT disappointed.  Alex shines as Luke Anderson, and the movie is excellent.  I love the Australian films - very realistic and their casting is perfect. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to see an exciting and moving drama filled with just the right amount of humor - and for anyone who is a fan of the brilliant Alex O'Loughlin.",1233100800,22,423,4.6891891891891895
