987534,5,6305186677,"Just watched Basket Case for the 2nd time and my God is it touching. No, seriously, it's really sad. Such a great little horror movie with some good gore, decent acting, great direction, but be prepared to feel sympathy for the main characters. Their existence is a depressing one and this movie is able to do everything one would expect from a good horror movie and manages to do it very originally. Themes of revenge, sexual repression, loneliness, traumatic childhood . . . it's all here. A low budget, indie film doesn't get much better than this.",981072000,,551,4.690721649484536
987535,5,6305186677,"The ads for this cult classic proudly displayed Rex Reed's quote (""The sickest movie I've ever seen""). It's a horror-comedy about Duane Bradley (Kevin VanHentenryck), a soft-spoken, mild-mannered young man  who takes his little brother Belial to New York City. What's sick about  that? Well, Belial is Duane's deformed, telepathically bonded Siamese twin,  who lives in a wicker basket and looks like a snaggle-toothed hamburger  patty. The brothers hole up in a dingy hotel (Hotel Broslin!) and track  down the three doctors who surgically separated them. Laughable stop-motion  animation, explicit gore, and an extremely bad-taste sex scene push this  $35,000 first feature by Frank Henenlotter off limits to all but the most  decadent viewers, which means people like me and YOU, if you've read this  far. Vile fun if you're in the right mood and company; this isn't the kind  of movie you take home to meet your mom. Followed by two progressively  cretinous sequels, also by Henenlotter. Stick with this movie, ""Brain  Damage,"" and ""Frankenhooker.""",964656000,6,1052,5.271084337349397
987536,3,6305186677,"Sick and twisted, this flick is still lots of fun. It's about two brothers, Siamese twins who were surgically seperated against their wishes at an early age. One is normal. The other, a mis-shapen monster with razor  sharp claws, is carried around by his sibling in a large basket. They've  come to New York City with revenge on their minds, seeking to track down  the doctors who performed the surgery and do away with them by whatever  means necessary.
Great stuff! You won't find anything as weird as this.  Contains many colorful sleazeball characters, as well as some amusing  stop-motion effects. Followed by two sequels.",962841600,,627,4.923809523809524

987538,4,6305186677,"If you like your movies to be a little humurous, a little strange and a lot sick then this is definately for you.  The premise behind this film is one of the most twisted that I have ever encountered, right up there with  Texas chainsaw massacre.  The effects have not aged well in terms of  realism but somehow this adds to the overall wierdness of the movie.  The  acting is actually surprisingly good, Kevin VanHentenryck is particularly  suited to his role as Duane, a man driven to murder because of his love for  his hideously deformed brother, for whom he seeks revenge.  So if you've  got a soft mind and a hard stomach i'm sure you will enjoy this as much as  I did.",957052800,,675,4.362903225806452
987649,4,6305186677,"Much like the early work of Tim Burton, the films of director Frank Henenlotter exist in their own twisted universe.  Only instead of a gothic suburban fairyland, Basket Case (1982) puts down stakes in a seedy Times Square hotel populated by an endearingly colorful collection of hookers, thieves and pimps.  The newest tenant is Duane Bradley (Kevin Van Hentenryck), a naive upstate import whose most defining characteristic is the large wicker basket he carries under his arm.  What's in the basket?  Why, his separated Siamese twin, Belial, who looks more like a stumpy octopus, on a mission of revenge against the doctors who performed their illegal operation and ""broke up the band,"" so to speak.

Inheriting the ""Midnight Movie"" mantle from Rocky Horror (it had a two year run at one famous NYC theater), Basket Case wormed its way into the horror genre like a venereal disease.  But Henenlotter's film has a DIY aesthetic that's charming even when it's being crude.  The finale features some sexual shock tactics, but for the most part humor outweighs horror, slipping comfortably into Evil Dead territory.  Belial himself, brought to life with a mix of puppetry, make-up and stop-motion, is never remotely convincing...yet still makes for an unforgettable co-star along with the grungy 42nd Street vibe.

Arrow Video's new limited edition Blu-ray offers up a stunning new 4K restoration from the original 16mm negative, interviews, outtakes, audio commentary, stills, trailers and Henenlotter's 1972 short film The Slash of the Knife, a Reefer Madness-style faux documentary about the perils of circumcision!",1520467200,,1616,5.28125
987650,4,6305186677,"They say that horror films run in cycles. The first major one involved the classic Universal monsters like Frankenstein, Dracula and the Wolf Man. The second came during the fifties when we had radiated monsters that turned miniscule pests into giant sized terrors. The early sixties provided us with two forms of horror, the drive in low budget films that included the Poe tales from Roger Corman and the imported Hammer horror films more often than not starring Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing. Then a lull came along with only THE EXORCIST on hand. All of that changed in the late seventies and early eighties.

The invention of the VCR ushered in a new wave of horror films. Once again the budgets were low but the creative levels were high. Video renters couldn't get enough of horror films. Directors who went on to become famous were making many of these movies, cutting their teeth on combinations of editing techniques and gushing goo. It was a time when horror fans were delighted. Then Hollywood became aware of the money to be made. Suddenly it changed from creative output to franchise material. Many were good movies but it became all about how long a series could run.

Fortunately fans can still partake in the classics of the time period, those 70s and 80s slashers and creature movies that made you force your parents to allow you to traipse down the horror aisle as the local video store. One such movie has now made its way to blu-ray format in the best offering of the movie ever seen. That movie is Frank Henenlotters BASKETCASE.

The movie tells the story of two brothers, Duane (Kevin Van Hentenryck) and Belial. Joined together at birth Belial was a malformed creature attached to his brothers side. When years later a medical team separates the pair, Belial survives and communicates with his brother. Together the two run away with plans of revenge against the medical staff who forced them apart.

After an initial murder we find the pair walking the streets of New York in the 42nd Street area, notorious for the sleaziness of the times. Porn theaters, hotels with hourly rental rates and greasy food joints abound. Checking into a hotel with Belial in a wicker basket, Duane begins his search for the staff.

As their story unfolds Duane meets and falls for a young nurse named Sharon (Terri Susan). With his attentions deviated from their goal Belial is enraged. The malformed monstrosity is not one to take lightly, especially when angered. Whether the pair will carry on with their plans for revenges or if Duane will find some sense of normality isn't revealed until the end of the film. The fact that the film generated 2 sequels answers part of that question. Both of those films are available on blu-ray now as well.

To start with the movie provides us with a new monster, something that had disappeared from the film landscape for some time. After years of radiated creatures we now had one born for no apparent reason other than that he simply was. It would be a few more years before the genetically altered creatures arrived and Belial is not one of those. The effects used to create Belial were practical effects, puppets and the like, giving him a more sinister appearance than any computer generated creature has had. That added to the terror aspect of the character, making him frightening, something youd hope to never encounter. And at the same time there is an amount of sympathy imbued in the character, a monster not by choice but by birth. In this way he becomes the new Frankenstein in a modern world.

As I said earlier the movies from this time period had some of the most miniscule budgets ever known to man. Many were shot on the fly, no permits sought out for locations, shot in actual buildings rather than sets and using actors who were lacking on so many levels. But all of that combined to give films like this one a charm all their own. Hentenrycks delivery of lines leaves much to be desired but it also makes his performance as an innocent in a nasty world more believable. The side actors also offer lines in the worst way possible but who cares? This is a creature feature and no one is looking for Shakespeare.

Henenlotter has delivered the goods with this film, his first feature length movie. Many directors their first time out try to dazzle us with their techniques, film angles, effects laden shots and more. Henenlotter just wants to tell us a story and frighten us at the same time. That makes for a much more enjoyable film. The seediness of the area the film takes place in is embraced by Henenlotter, a world most of us will never visit but we get a glimpse of here from someone familiar with it. It is a world that suits Duane and Belial Bradley and their story.

Arrow Video has done their standard amazing job with this one. To begin with their presenting the film in a digital 4k format making it the cleanest possible version youll find of the film. In addition to that theyve loaded the film with a ton of extras sure to make any fan foam at the mouth. Those include a brand new audio commentary track with Henenlotter and Hentenryck, Basket Case 3 : An Interview with Duane Bradley a look back at the character with Henenlotter, Seeing Double: The Basket Case Twin a new interview with Florence and Maryellen Schultz the twin nurses from the film, a brand new making of featurette with interviews of producer Edgar Ievins, casting person/actress Ilze Balodis, associate producer/effects artist Ugis Nigals and Belial performer Kika Nigals, Blood, Basket and Beyong a new interview with actress Beverly Bonner, Belial Goes to the Drive-In a new interview with film critic Joe Bob Briggs, an outtakes featurette, In Search of the Hotel Broslin an archive featurette, Slash of the Knife a short film made by Henenlotter in 1972, Belials Dream a brand new Basket Case inspired animated short by filmmaker Robert Morgan, behind the scenes of Belials Dream, trailers, TV spots, radio spots, an extensive still gallery, a reversible sleeve with original artwork by Sara Deck and for the first pressing only a collectors booklet with new writing on the film by Michael Gingold. Whew! Thats an exhaustive amount of extras for a movie that probably costs less than all of these combined!

Fans of the film will rejoice at the opportunity to revisit Duane and Belial once more. Theyll revel in every blood soaked moment that appears on screen. Those who have never seen the film will discover just how great it truly is, enough so that they might decide to gather the entire set of three films. In any event this edition from Arrow shows once more how dedicated they are at offering the best quality version of the films they carry. A fan couldn't ask for more.",1520208000,,6738,4.707379134860051

They don't make them like this anymore. I would recommend to any gorehound. As long as you aren't the type that only watches the newest hollywood crap. This movie being of low budget has more worth than half of any horror movie in recent time. This is just my opinion of course, but i enjoy the older low budget horrors compared to all the cgi movies that have become the norm. So be sure to watch this twisted horror gem.

987656,5,6305186677,"It's Saturday night (May 28, 2016), and today is Mr. Kevin Vanhentenryck's Birthday. To honor him, I celebrated by having some good food and watching his movie that he is known for. This is the first film of his, and the first chapter in the Basket Case series. I never knew about this horror film series until 2013. At that time, I wasn't really looking into recommendations on the net, and I wasn't even active on social media. My Dad was the man who would recommend movies to me. He was a massive horror fan, and would always go to cinemas and check movies out of video stores back in the '80s. Then one day back in 2013, he told me, ""Son, you don't know sh*t about horror until you have seen what I've seen."" I asked him, ""Dad, what awesome horror films have I missed out on from the 70s and 80s?"" He gave me a huge and I mean massive list, which just goes on and on. I had to write all of them in a book. The first one he told me to look for was Basket Case. I said, ""Dad, what's that?"" He told me, ""Just get it, and you'll see. It's one of the best films I have ever seen, son."" So, I found it online, and got it, along with its sequels. When I saw this for the first time, I was like, ""Wow, Dad, no joke, this movie is just filled with horrifying, bizarre, blood gushing, sleazy screaming fun until the end."" It's one hell of an entertaining film. Kevin was so damn incredible on screen, he was excellent. With Terri Susan Smith, Beverly Bonner, and others. They were all perfect. Frank Henenlotter did an awesome job. I watched it over again with my Dad. This movie is special to me because this was his last horror film, and I hadn't seen it since my dad passed until today. It brought back great memories. And every horror fan should own this movie, including its sequels, on home video. It's a masterpiece, truly a gem!!!",1517961600,2,1832,4.222222222222222

988087,5,6305186677,"The early 80s had plenty of slashers high budget films and low budget films. There are plenty of great 80s films and well I love most of the 80s horror films, as you can tell by now I am a huge horror fan and while it's sometimes easy to please new horror films just don't succeed, today's horror films are all about, sex, nudity, drugs, and stupid characters who are played by talentless actors who were only chosen for their looks. Yes true, back in the 80s there was terrible acting and some movies were/are bad but they still succeeded at either giving us good characters that are likeable or plenty of blood and slashing. So with Basket Case, as usual I'll cover the good, the bad, and the ugly, speaking of ugly Belial is no hound dog himself.

The Good: Some characters are interesting and fleshed out a little SOME, most of the acting ranges from good to a little bad, for the low budget the puppetry and stop motion looks good, the score is weird but in a good way which goes with the film nicely, the filmography is good, the dialogue is okay, and the gore well...the gore is great and there's plenty of it. Oh and by the way for those who have not read my other reviews it's really hard to gross me out and this one did not gross me out but then again I'm a guy who buried dead pets that were ran over in the road(for my family).

The Bad: A little bit of the acting is bad.

The Ugly: Nothing was down right terrible.

The Story: Duane carries around a whisker basket, and every one is dieing to find out what's inside,literally. Well Duane will only tell you what's in the basket if he's a little drunk. To tell you guys the truth, Belial is in the basket, he and Duane were Siamese twin brothers. Ever since Belial was baby his family treated him like a monster except for Duane and their Aunt. The brothers' father forces them to be separated at the age of 12. Once separated they keep Duane and throw Belial in a trash bag and leave him with the trash outside. Duane rescues poor Belial and the two brothers kill their father while their Aunt covers for them. Now at the age of I guess 19 or 20, the brothers go to New York where they stay at a hotel and butcher the doctors who separated them who actually deserve it. It's explained that Belial  and Duane when attached had a telepathic bond, however when separated Duane lost the telepathic bond while Belial still had it.

Some facts about the film: Near the end originally Henenlotter wanted to have Belial go down the street and go to Duane's girlfriend's house. However there wasn't enough money so he wanted to instead do something really weird. While Belial goes down the street we get a shot of Duane sweating and having a dream of himself running down the street, which in the dream Duane=Belial and through this we understand that both can feel what each other is doing it was hinted at that Belial could do this but not Duane until this point. When Duane is running in the street he is completely naked something that I was not aware of or even remembered (I saw this on cable a long time ago at the age of 10 while my parents were asleep). Anyway when you watch the film you'll see Duane's junk, now I'm not homosexual but it does not bother me that much since because it's normal it's called the human body suck it up and deal with it.

Basket Case had two sequels which I love as well, Basket Case 2, and Basket Case 3: The Progeny. Neither show male nudity but we do see Belial get it on with a female that's like him (that's in part 2), in part 3 we see said female give birth.
Frank Henenlotter would not only direct the sequels but direct another two fun awesome favorite flicks of mine, Brain Damage 1988 and Frankenhooker. In the film Brain Damage we get a cameo by Duane with his basket which Belial is in.

Now on the DVD case that is Belial he is a twisted lump of flesh with 2 arms, and a face. He has no feet but can move using his hands and arms. Belial also has an anger problem and super strength.

There is only one problem that I had with this film and it's that the ending was too short. Don't get me wrong it's a good ending with great tension but the fight SPOILER between the brothers should have lasted a bit longer. To be honest I love Basket Case a lot and the sequels.

This is a film I expected to get a bare bones DVD release but it didn't, the DVD is full of great special features.

The DVD contents:

Main feature
2 trailers
1 TV spot
Outtakes and behind the scenes footage
Special video short: In search of the hotel Broslin
Photo gallery
2 rare Basket Case radio spots
2 radio interviews with actress Terri Susan Smith
Clips from Beverley Bonner's comedy TV show
and an Audio commentary
The DVD comes with a scene selections paper which shows the lovely Belial. On the DVD back cover if you remove the white square sticker it says ""SOLD AS A PACKAGE DO NOT SEPARATE"" weather that's how Something Weird Video puts on all their DVDs or as a joke it cracks me up.

All in all for me Basket Case is a 5/5 stars.

Warning: This film is not for children, not for the squeamish, not for non B movie fans, and not for the casual movie goer. There's female and male nudity, and plenty of blood. Keep in mind I'm fine with nudity in films but keep it to a minimum, there is not a whole lot of nudity only two shots one of Duane and one of his girlfriend, neither bother me but may bother some.",1371600000,5,5395,4.255859375
988088,5,6305186677,"Greetings;

Ordered this movie because I am a fan of the director and figured I would give it a shot. What does this movie have to do with Roy Orbinson's Black & White Night on dvd from Image productions? Beats me. Movie was brand new when I bought it, took it from the case and found that on the underside of the disc was some bizarre...Ink stain maybe? Its like if when the movie  was just made and was still hot it had been laid down on either maybe the Orbinson's disc artwork or perhaps the paper insert cover art? Though I really think it would be what would be printed on the disc itself. This movie is from MMI which may have something do to with Image perhaps but still. Movie played but I have to admit, just seems a bit unprofessional is all. Don't believe the music was in the movie at all, though I guess as the company's title goes, this is just indeed 'something weird(something weird entertainment).'

988127,1,6305186677,"<strong>Basket Case</strong> (Frank Henenlotter, 1982)

The only movie at this year's 12 Hours of Terror that I hadn't previously seen was <em>Basket Case</em>, Frank Henenlotter's infamous debut film. And I wasn't sure whether I'd seen it or not until the film began, actually; I've heard so much about it over the years that I honestly couldn't remember. This was another film that had recently been digitally restored (cf. <em>Zombi 2</em> review elsewhere this ish), so a lot of audience members were very excited by this one. I was feeling a bit more reserved. I'd seen a couple of Henenlotter flicks over the past few years and been, to be kind, unimpressed. As I feared, <em>Basket Case</em> had all the things I didn't like about <em>Frankenhooker</em> and <em>Bad Biology</em>, and no extra redeeming qualities.

Plot: Duane Bradley (Kevin van Hentenryck in his screen debut; he would not make a movie not directed by Henenlotter for twenty-two years after this) is visiting New York City for the first time. He always carries around a locked wicker basket wherever he goes, which makes the tenants in the seedy hotel where he sets up shop wonder what's in it, especially after he pays for his room with bills peeled from a huge wad of cash. (Henenlotter has said in interviews that was the film's entire budget, liquidated. I don't think he was joking.) We soon find out that (a) what is in the basket is Belial, Duane's brother, a psychotic, homicidal, insanely strong lump of flesh, and (b) Duane and Belial are in town to find and take revenge on two of the doctors who separated them (they were conjoined twins until the age of twelve; the third doctor we see being murdered in the film's opening sequence). All well and good until Duane meets Sharon (Terri Susan Smith, the best actress in the film; ironically, this was her only screen role), the receptionist at the office of Dr. Needleman (Lloyd Pace, also in his only screen performance), and is attracted to her. You see, Duane and Belial have a psychic bond...

What really annoyed me more than anything else about this movie is that the script had so many interesting places to go and Henenlotter refused to explore any of them. There's a great bit about two-thirds of the way through where a love triangle might have developed, as Duane and his neighbor Casey (Beverly Bonner) go out drinking and get to some soul-baring, but Henenlotter uses this as a plot device and nothing else. That's typical of this script; it knows where it wants to go and refuses to allow any distractions. It's always better if, when you ask yourself ""what if?"", you at least spend enough time exploring to get some background on your characters. Even if they are cardboard representations at best, like here.

And then there's everything else. I was half-surprised by Smith's acting, and even taking into account that everyone else here being so terrible makes her look good in comparison, she probably could have worked herself into a solid career given better material. Instead, she disappeared. Henenlotter's direction is decent in that he does know where to point the camera, kinda-sorta, but that's about the best I can say about that. And the creature effects... well, they're cheesy enough that horror fans can buy shirts and stuff with Belial's mug on them, and Belial really does look kinda cool... until they attempt to move him. Good god, the stop-motion animation in this movie is worse than that in some of the creature features of the 1930s. Back then, you can excuse it as primitive technology. What's the excuse here?

This is just plain bad, especially for a movie with as much staying power among hardcore horror fans as this one has had. And it doesn't even have the affectionately-cheesy angle of something like, say, <em>Street Trash</em> to make it worth watching by anyone who doesn't have nostalgia for it. *",1325116800,,3883,4.850678733031674
988128,5,6305186677,"Image has put out some really bad blu rays. That have lines and scratches on them even, ""time bandits' which is a A list movie looks really bad. This was a very small budget movie shot for vhs release back in the 80's. It used cheap film and was in full screen format. The format is preserved here and the film has been cleaned up. THis looks outstanding, and this how ALL IMAGE BLU RAYS should be done. Remastered and cleaned up, with no print damage. There are a few extras on this one too that add to the experience. No obviously non  horror fans would trash this movie with it's quick cutaways and minimum budget. But we lovers of low budget horror and this is not a b movie , it's lower budgeted than that: dig this kind of cheaply made horror flick. The effects are everything from stopmotion figures , (they take pictures of a model frame by frame) to very effective puppet work ala many movies of that era. WHich often still looks better than some of todays cgi. See fright night for that. The first one is much better because of it's manual effects and far better story actually too.  The acting is decent for firsttimers and the lead actor did a good job actually. Basketcase is good very low budget horror film, it suceeded in being a twisted movie when other higher budget movies like xtro did only a so so job.  So for fans of this type of movie , this is a five star blu ray.  IMAGE KEEP CLEANING UP YOUR MOVIES!.",1322870400,3,1427,4.29368029739777
988169,5,6305186677,"Having owned the 20the anniversary DVD since it's release, I was a little weary of this on blu-ray. After all, a 16mm 1:33.1 shoestring-budget film shot almost 30 years ago, would be a hard-sell on high-def. But boy, I am glad I caved.

A young man and his deformed Siamese twin, separated at birth, check into a seedy 42dn Street hotel. They soon plot their revenge against the doctors who separated them. All the while causing some other mayhem at the hotel. This a fun, trashy and gory flick. Made back in the glory of days of true grindhouse cinema, when old 42nd Street was 42nd Street, sleazy, rundown, porno theaters, etc, before the Disneyification. An accurate representation of that era in NYC's history.

Lots of bloodshed in this one, gorehounds take note.(POSSIBLE SPOILERS) A man ripped in half, a woman with scalpels in her bloody face are just a taste of what we get. Again, that wonderful ultra-sleazy atmosphere and feel. Pure guerrilla film-making at it's finest. Lots of good laughs as well,unintentional, well, yes, but that's all the fun of it. It's too bad they don't make them like this anymore.

The blu-ray picture is as good as it's ever going to be. Fully restored to it's OAR of 1:33.1(when it was blown to 1.85, a lot of info was missing)and remastered from it's original 16mm negative, natural film grain abounds. Picture looks cleaner and more watchable than ever. Some blue scratches pop up occasionally, but they did on the DVD as well. Audio is the original mono track, so purists will be pleased. Very clear sound.

Extra wise, we get a new intro by the director, the man himself, the great Frank Henenlotter. For two minutes, he explains why he did this for blu-ray and the long process of doing so. Very nice. Up next, we get the audio commentary lifted from the DVD. Very fun track as Frank and co. reflect on making this movie, it's reception, legacy and many troubles. They even mention how the great Joe Bob Briggs saved this film from being permanently butchered at the idiotic request of the long-defunct Analysis Releasing. Next of course, is the 15-minute feature In Search of the Hotel Broslin. Frank and a friend go to the locations they filmed, including the club they filmed some scenes in. Very interesting and informative. A very nice
gallery of outtakes and behind the scenes footage follows. Brief at 5 minutes, but def worth a look. TV spots, trailers, radio spots and still gallery of art are the other features. Now, the blu-ray is missing two extras from the DVD: a radio interview with Terri Susan Smith and a segment showing clips from Beverly Bonner's old TV show,""Laugh Track"". Not a big deal. I will hang onto the DVD as well.

This is a must-see/own for horror/cult/grindhouse and of course a must-own for fans and Frank Henenlotter fans. Highly recommended.",1321228800,12,2822,4.751020408163265

It's worth having for a horror movie collector like myself, but not even in my top 50. Blu Ray quality - it keeps is 4:3 aspect ratio.

A few years later, you are forced to undergo an operation where you are both separated; and one twin is even thrown into a trash bag after the procedure and the other is left with a huge nasty scar running down the side of his ribcage. Years later, the 2 travel to NYC to get vengenance-they kill the doctor's responsible for their separation, and boy is it bloody. Not only does this film showcase blood, gore, and murder, but it also illustrates a relationship between 2 brothers-a relationship that is quite bizarre to fathom and at times very sad. Realistically speaking, I am not aware of any twin who is merely a lump of flesh and is able to survive for many years. Also, I wonder what would the pyschological effects be on someone who has endured ridicule from its family since birth because of its appearance, notably its own father. Nevertheless, Belial's menancing rampage and sharp teeth are profound features throughout the film; and did I mention that he screams-that's a plus! The ending is very sad, though not surprising. Oh, and the setting is worth the watch as well when NYC was gritty and infested with drugs and prostitutes. I was born and reared in NYC and I must say, I absolutely miss NYC during those days; everything was raw and non-superficial.

But the info I want to make known is that the transfer for BC is a brand new one coming from the previously-thought lost negative. Henenlotter himself has stated online at places like Facebook that he thought he'd lost it but came across it a couple years back buried in his storage. He is excited about this as BC has never truly been seen the way he intended it to look -- transfer always came from beat up prints instead of the negative and never got the true attention he'd hoped for. This blu-ray will be a milestone for fans of Henenlotter, BASKET CASE, Belial and Something Weird Video. Here's hoping the BLOOD TRILOGY turns out as well!",1309737600,13,822,4.443708609271523
988174,5,6305186677,"Conjoined twins are surgically separated but not at birth. It happened later on in life when they both were old enough to really know what was going on. They cursed and screamed during the surgery. They didn't want to be separated. Their daddy was ashamed of them. He was angry they were born and mad because their mother died giving birth. They were raised by a caring aunt. When she died they had to take care of themselves. These twins were close. So close they knew each others thoughts without speaking. After they get cut apart and the ugly small twin is tossed in the trash the twins team up to MAKE EVERYONE PAY IN A BLOODY WAY!

The movie is called ""Basket Case"" because the big healthy twin retrieves his brother from the trash he was thrown away in by the doctors and totes him around in a basket. Those doctors are going to pay when both twins find them as well as anyone who gets in their way!

If you've ever had a blood thirsty surgically separated conjoined twin and you both fell in love, or lust, with the same girl don't watch this movie. It will really hit home for you.

I like this better than all three ""It's Alive"" movies. The crazy baby in the basket in those movies is a baby. The Basket Case monster is not a baby. It's an older surgically separated crazy killer conjoined twin that ought to know better than to kill people. There's just something about being hidden in a basket that brings out the worst in people!

The face on Mr. Basket Case is a human man face at times. Other times he's got a crazy mad cartoonish face! In scenes he's moving around he's a claymation horror classic. He looks like something Ray Harryhausen's mind threw-up and I mean that in a ""you've got to see this"" kind of way. This beats hundreds if not thousands of other horror movie expensive special effects. A person that knows how to run a camera and shoot props at certain angles is more valuable to a horror movie than millions of bucks worth of computer effects.

There's a lot of SCREAMING in this movie but all of the screaming in the movie is done as well as screaming can be done. The screaming and crazed yelling is appropriate every single time.

SEMI-SPOILER ALERT:

This movie has a classic King Kong kind of finish if everyone hated King Kong and King Kong chewed up and mauled people just because it was his thing to do.

988178,4,6305186677,"Horror has long been a genre where fledging filmmakers without much backing can make a start.  Written and directed by Frank Henenlotter, Basket Case (1982) is a classic example of very effective, schlocky 80's horror, done on an extremely low budget.

This twentieth anniversary special edition features a much improved transfer of the film, which still often has a VHS type appearance.  While production values are obviously on the economy end, the extreme extent that costs affected the production is revealed in the commentary track, which features Henenlotter, producer Edgar Levins, and actress Beverly Bonner.  The discussion is very informative, and highly entertaining, with Henelotter dominating the conversation with an almost non-stop stream of recollections about how the film was made.  Henenlotter and those associated with this project, truly made the most with the meager resources that were available.

The film blends suspense, gore, humor, and horror, in a nicely fleshed out story of revenge and jealousy, involving two most unusual ""brothers"".  Kevin Van Hentenryck makes his acting debut as Duane Bradley, a young man who arrives in New York City, and checks into a rundown dump called the Hotel Broslin, carrying a wad of cash, and a big brown woven basket.

In the basket is something that is hideous, grotesque, and quite deadly.  The creature named ""Belial"", has a burning desire for revenge against the doctors who performed an unauthorized surgery, and left him to die.  With Duane's help, the guilty are being made to pay, in a most hellacious manner.  The jealous side of Belial comes out, when Duane begins a relationship with Sharon (Terri Susan Smith), the receptionist of one the doctors.

Belial is feeling frisky as well, leaving his basket and going across the hall to visit Casey's (Beverly Bonner) apartment, to borrow some of her underwear.  The gory killings continue, with Dr. Kutter's (Diana Browne) memorable five scalpel facial being one of the film's gruesome highlights, topped only by Belial's depraved attack on an innocent, and helpless victim in her sleep.  This atrocity proves to be too much even for Duane to tolerate, but he is no match for the ferocious Belial.

The special effects are obviously severely limited by costs, and access to materials and technology.  While far from smooth, many of the scenes are surprisingly effective, and humorous.  For some sequences, a clay figure of Belial is animated using stop motion, and the jumpy results look similar to a Gumby feature.  Though not technically impressive, these scenes have a certain crude charm and humor.

Kevin Van Hentenryck's acting is far from polished, but his sometimes jumpy performance, fits in pretty well with the grungy vibe of the production.  Terri Susan Smith's performance is very fresh and natural, in what is so far, her only film appearance.  Besides the commentary track, the twentieth anniversary special  edition also includes a number of featurettes, trailers, artwork, a clip from Beverly Bonner's cable TV program, and a pair of radio interviews with Terri Smith.

Basket Case became a cult hit through video rentals, and it is easy to understand why.  A hideous monster, a sensibly twisted backstory, quirky characters, a little romance, and mayhem and gore often executed at just barely passable levels, all add up to gruesomely fun 80's horror gem.  The merriment would eventually spawn two sequels, also featuring Kevin Van Hentenryck, who would also carry a basket, in Henenlotter's horror film Brain Damage (1988).",1280361600,,3563,5.208771929824562
988223,4,6305186677,"Frank Henenlotter breaks into the 42nd Street Cinema scene with this outrageous story about a drifter, Duane, and his hideously deformed twin that he keeps with him in a wicker basket. The two set off across the state to exact their bloody revenge against the doctors that separated them years ago. BASKET CASE is a bizarre, gory, and utterly hilarious cult shocker that ranks alongside other campy classics like H.G. Lewis' BLOOD FEAST. The cheesy low-budget FX and ridiculously over-the-top characters combine to create the formula for the perfect B-movie. Obvious film flaws like Duane's ever-changing wig size and Belial's constantly shifting design only add to its peculiar charm. In spite of his cheap rubbery appearance, Belial is extremely frightening, and is sure to shock even modern audiences. The modest budget of the film does not inhibit Henenlotter from blasting the screen with an insane amount of blood and gore, and his cleverly designed set pieces allow the puppeteers playing Belial plenty of room to articulate the creature into a believable reality from within his basket home. No Horror collection can be without this staple 80s mainstay!

988224,4,6305186677,"I remember seeing this movie in a video store a long time ago but I never saw it until recently.  It is a good movie if a bit low budget.  Some of the special effects weren't too special if you know what i mean.  The stop motion sequence is quite funny but back in the day it must have looked, oh who am I kidding it probably looked like crap back in the day too. Whenever Belial kills someone it looks kinda silly.  The funniest part is when Belial kills the nosy neighbor.  He's supposed to be mauling him but he's just kinda weakly pawing at his face. That scene made me guffaw heartily. But still I found it to be an enjoyable film.  It will definitely fill your gore quotient with plenty of violent scenes.

  Pros:angry midget with a penchant for killing and sitting on womens groins and making them bleed(what was that about?)
  Cons:crappy special effects  Weird hotel/apartment(It's supposed to be a hotel but all the people seem to just live there like it's an apartment. I don't know, man.",1254614400,3,1000,4.434065934065934

HOWEVER!!!
If you want a low-budget, high-quality cheap-thrill of a comedy-horror crossover, ""Basket Case"" will become your new beloved Friday night splatter-fest. The plot has been retold in other reviews, so I won't get to that. However, I WILL pinpoint the highlights of this movie in hopes that they will inspire you to go check it out:

- Lots of blood and gore. You can tell how cheap the special effects are, but that's part of what makes them so great!
- Lots of cheap laughs/jokes, etc.. At one point, Duane and the nice lady across the hall from him, forget her name, go to a bar and have a little too much booze. Drunken hilarity ensured!
- Colorful and imaginative characters. There's a budding romance between Duane and the girl that works at a doctor's office he visits at one point. This adds a nice touch throughout the movie.
- Brotherly relations. Throughout the movie, we also see some develeopment between Duane and his severed brother, Belial. This actually adds depth to the movie and makes it even more interesting.
- Shocking ending. I won't give away what happens, but after you watch this movie, just know that there's a sequel so anything that may happen to Duane or Belial isn't permanent. (THANK GOD!)

In conclusion, ""Basket Case"" is a low-budget comedy-horror crossover full of cheap laughs, heavy gore, some brilliant character development and an ending that ensures a dynamic sequel! Pick this up for your rainy Friday night, kick back and enjoy the madness! Thanks for the time, and peace.",1245974400,4,1807,4.898692810457517

How a young boy suffered with a diformity of a creature type brother attached to him. As brothers they were very close to one another by being shelterd by the real world. The Father was very distressed by this freak thing that happened to his newly born son. An operation was created to sepaarte the brother from him. Belile was the deformatly brother. Dwane was the one that looked after him. They did not want this operation to perform. Belile was terrified to have this operation.

But the stress comes on Dwayne when he leaves his brother for  a minute in their seedy motel that they stayed in. Dwane finds  a nice girl he relates to .While Belil feels Unsecure and alone.

And while neither act is what the director was aiming for, Basket Case's jokiness, bad dialogue, daffy characters, and bizarre violence makes it a cult classic among low-budget horror films. It is one of the rare trashy films that is so poorly constructed it provides above-average entertainment.

Duane Bradley (Kevin Van Hentenryck) hides a horrifying secret - in a locked wicker basket that he constantly keeps at his side. Checking into a seedy hotel in Times Square, he plots a series of visits to various doctor's offices scattered around the city. As he visits each one, he unlocks the basket to allow a terrifyingly grotesque creature to scurry out, searching for addresses, paperwork, and brutally bloody revenge.

The mystery monstrosity in Duane's basket is no secret at all (given away by theatrical posters, DVD cover art and more) and is the remains of his Siamese twin brother Belial. A twisted lump of scar tissue, cartilage, and deformed flesh, Belial was removed by merciful doctors at the behest of their father, who hoped for a normal life for Duane. Not realizing that Belial could survive the torturous operation, and that Duane abhorred the separation, the duo remained conspiratorially in cohorts, growing up to plot revenge against the doctors involved. Communicating through telepathy and eager for blood, Belial is unleashed upon a city not ready for the horrors of this ""Basket Case.""

Basket Case is one of the pioneers of exploitation horror, complete with nudity, bloodshed, hilariously absurd dialogue, and silly creature effects. Low budget and not afraid to show it, the film tops its competitors of the day with memorable characters, an eerie story and the outlandish rubbery head of Belial. No character is normal in the film - everyone reeks of abnormalities, from eccentric behaviors and nonsensical dialogue, to extravagantly unpredictable actions.

To avoid showing Belial's obnoxiously unrealistic head studded with stubby, clawed hands, the camera oftentimes follows his point of view - close to the ground and with jerky movements. Flashbacks tell his tale, and plot holes abound. The unintentional laughs are hard to avoid as the screaming monster steals women's underwear, chows down on hamburgers, and leaves one of the doctors with a face full of scalpels. It's gruesome, gory, and way over-the-top; and so bad that it's good. There's time for an unlikely love story, moments for lines such as ""you're cute when you slobber,"" and unabashed, awkward nudity. If unwarranted, uncensored cheesiness is your ticket to entertainment, Basket Case doesn't disappoint. And based on the fact that it inspired two sequels, director Frank Henenlotter's unique horror film is most certainly a cult classic.

988230,4,6305186677,"The term ""cult classic"" is almost always used when someone talks about Basket Case.  There is a reason for this.  We goofballs that enjoy bizarre and wacky under-the-radar type horror and exploitation flicks are well aware of Frank Henenlotter's odd tale of separated Siamese twins gone berserk.  Henenlotter is one of those directors who's also a hardcore fan of B cinema.  He has his own company, Something Weird Video, that releases these black sheep of cinema.  I don't even believe that if Henenlotter got a shot at big budget film making, that he'd even do it, or enjoy it.
Criticisms of Basket Case tend to target the quality of the FX, the acting and picture quality.  Usually these criticisms come from mainstream folk who decided to feel adventurous and watch a ""cult classic"".  But it's those very same targets that make the film beloved by the cult crowd.  Budget doesn't hinder a movie like Basket Case, it enhances it, makes it more unique and entertaining.  I'm not saying everyone should love Basket Case.  After all it wouldn't exactly be a cult film if everyone did.  But it is required reading for those into this sort of thing, and it's a wonderful example of a writer/director working independent from the studios and making the best of what he can with the meager amount of money he has.  Hey, it worked for Romero, Hooper, Lewis, Craven and Cohen!
Basket Case is a movie inspired by dozens of B movies, therefore it's not taking itself seriously.  It's not a full on comedy or campfest, but Henenlotter is winking at the audience.  He is just having fun and allowing you to join in.  Hopefully you do.",1212796800,,1624,4.709219858156028

Riding along in his basket is a pathetic but very dangerous creature named Belial who is actually Duane's much smaller, deformed Siamese twin. Still intensely angry about being forcibly separated from each other many years ago, Belial and Duane are in town to get violent revenge on the doctors who secretly took part in the procedure. A complication arises, however, when Duane sees a chance at happiness in the arms of Sharon, one of the doomed doctors' more outgoing receptionists.

If you are looking for some strange, low-budget, Grindhouse-style horror, look no further! It's easy to see why this film is legendary. It compiles some of the worst acting, effects, and so forth that I've ever seen! However, it's so consistently bad that it has its charm, and the story is twisted and interesting enough to please. Some viewers will surely fall in love with this one (many clearly have), and others will not, but it's worth checking out anyway. For my own eyes, the creature effects just fall way too flat, but I find the concept enjoyable and all the bad stuff too. Definitely a ""so bad it's good"" kinda movie. The 20th Anniversary Edition DVD is excellent for the diehard fan! The film is presented in fullscreen, which I believe is the correct aspect ratio, and is loaded with extras! There are trailers, TV, and radio spots, an enthusiastic commentary with director Frank Henenlotter, Producer Edgar Levins, and actress Beverly Bonner, a behind the scenes and promo gallery, radio interviews, clips from Beverly Bonner's awful cable comedy show, and a video short in which we are given a tour of some of the locales from the film.

A set of conjoined twins are separated by a veternarian against their will, and they go to New York City to seek revenge. The problem is one half of the twin set is normal, the other twin is a half-formed mutant freak. with telekenetic powers. The monster also has a jealous streak and cannot stand for his brother to enjoy a normal life. The rape/killing scene towards the end of the movie is one of the greatest gags in B-movie history.

The black prostitute has a minor role, but when she is on the camera she steals the scene, she is very funny and when the freak twin winds up in bed with her too, it is a laugh fest.

Sure the stop motion photography looks like it was done by a high school sophomore in AV, but it just adds to the whole atmosphere of the movie in that it has a few frights and is intentially funny, a perfect combo.

The violence and gore gave this movie an X rating originally but was released uncut and unrated into theaters, the acting maybe wooden but the storyline is quite original and features some good make-up and stop motion effects.

This special edition DVD has quality picture and sound with cool extras like audio commentary by director Frank Henenlotter with producer Edgar Levins and Actress Beverly Bonner, theatrical trailers, TV spots, outtakes, behind the scenes footage, a featurette, radio spots, radio interviews, clips from Beverly Bonner's comedy cable TV show ""Beverly Bonner's Laugh Track"", and poster-and-still gallery for this is a must have for true horror aficionados.

988285,5,6305186677,"People will say Basketcase sucks. That is what makes it great. Director Frank Henenlotter brilliantly directed this horror shlock gore fest. Henenlotter made the most of this films miniscule budget. Actors Kevin Van Hentenryck and Terri Susan Smith are incredible in their performances. Beverly Bonner played a prostitute, but her charachters performance and credability in this movie were incredible. Basketcase was done with alot of guts and a belief that it could be a success. Henenlotter was correct, this movie is known all over the world, and has made a fortune. Basketcase does have very bad (cheap) special effects especially the stop motion scenes of Belial, Duanes mutated twin. This movie does supply emotion, and is very touching at the end. Gus Russo supplys the soundtrack for this movie. When you see the end of Basketcase, Gus Russos music blends in beautifully with the scene and makes this scene very sad. If you the viewer of this movie are expecting ""Freddy vs. Jason"" effects your not even getting a microcosim of Freddy effects. This is a great grade c movie made during the age of gore 1978-1983. Alot of effort went into Basketcase as with most gore movies of this era, just try to have some imagination when watching Basketcase, so the special effects are not of ""Star Wars episode III"". I got news for you the reader, George Lucas himself along with alot of big time hollywood directors probably like basketcase for Henenlotters creativity and his belief in basketcase. The extras on this dvd are plentiful and the video short ""in search of the Hotel Broslin"" explains alot about Basketcase and is really a facinating look into this outrageous bizarre movie. The last 15 minutes of this film make this a heart warming classic. This film is not in widescreen like I wish it would have been, but the digital transfer of this film is done splendidly, the picture is really clean.

three horror flicks.  As many of you know, horror is

my forte...just look at my love life - LOL.  My latest

(and last) was supposed to be a cult classic - ""Basket

Case"".  Made in 1981 (24 years ago - YIKES!), I was a

mere baby (get real) when it hit the screens.  The

premise of the story is rather basic...and tragic.

Siamese twins are separated at the hip during their

teen years...one is a nice guy...the other a horrific

monster.

Bottom line, the film wasn't worth the electricity it

took to power my DVD player.  If there is one (or two)

things that irritate me about horror films it is

constant screaming.  I swear, they likely spent more

money auditioning for screamers than a director or

producer.  The shrills are totally overbearing.  I was

afraid every stray cat in the neighborhood would be

waiting on my doorstep when I finally turned this

loser off.

The second bottom line is the lame portrayal of women.

 If I ever see another film where a woman trips,

stumbles or falls while running from death, I'll

scream louder than any of those shrill-freak fanatics.

Get my drift?

Basket Case is one such film. Released to lukewarm attention at the Cannes Film Festival in 1982, the movie's overarching theme -- two separated brothers engulfed in a love-hate relationship because of their once conjoined state -- seemed out of place in the height of the Cold War. Yet the Berlin Wall ultimately fell, much as a doctor's scalpel separated the film's mismatched protagonists. Who knew then that the brothers' subsequent search for justice, marred by periodic distrust and misunderstanding, would so aptly serve as a post-glasnost roadmap for diplomats on both sides of the Atlantic? After all, Europe and America were separated, too, if by revolution rather than a surgeon's knife. If the thinkers at the Project for a New American Century and the French parliament had heeded this movie's cautionary tale, we wouldn't be involved in such current frivolities as ""freedom fries.""

But I digress. While this film was unjustly shut out of Oscar honors in 1982, someday Kevin VanHentenryck may well receive the award his masterwork most richly deserves: The Nobel Peace Prize.",1112140800,13,1297,5.1469194312796205

988390,4,6305186677,"Announcement from the Management: Tonight's planned double feature of ""Bloodlust"" and ""Atom Age Vampire"" has been postponed until Tuesday night due to circumstances beyond out control.  As a last minute replacement we offer up ""Basket Case.""  Our apologies for any inconvenience and for tonight only, we over double butter popcorn at no extra cost to you, our loyal and deeply disturbed customers.

I checked out ""Basket Case"" because director Frank Henelotter was having such a good timne as part of the commentary tag-team on Andy Milligan's ""The Ghastly Ones.""  Besides, any cheap horror film that can spawn a pair of sequels has to have something going for it and this becomes clear as soon as you take the hook on this 1982 movie.  Duane Bradley (Kevin Van Hentenryck) shows up in New York City carrying a large wicker basket with a lock on it.  Of course, everybody wants to know what is in that basket and somebody are nosy enough to try and find out, which means they end up dead.  That is because what is in the basket is Duane's Siamese twin, Belial (insert dramatic horror music at this point).

I was actually surprised that Duane could put the basket down, because I was not thinking Siamese twins like in the case of Chang and Eng, but more like those where one twin is partially absorbed into the body of the other; one twin grows to maturity and the other one stays small.  So I was no thinking that an operation had been performed to separate Duane and Belial, but that is the starting point for all the blood and gore in this film.  That, and the refusal of Duane's Father (Richard Pierce) to love both of his sons equally.  But the bond between these twins is strong, telepathic in fact, so that while Belial is killing somebody, Duane can feel it, even when he is on a date with the Sharon (Terri Susan Smith), the young woman he has met in the big city and with whom he shares a mutual attraction.

In radio interviews that are included in the DVD extras for ""Basket Case"" as the 20th Anniversary Special Edition, Smith keeps trying to pushing the idea that this film offers ""gore"" with ""charm.""  Belial is a latex puppet, but there is also some torturous stop motion animation.  There is also a scene with Belial and Sharon that starts off like a sick twist on a similar scene in ""Re-Animator,"" and then invites comparison to the infamous crucifix scene in ""The Exorcist.""  This is not hyperbole, because just when you think that this film has grossed you out as much as it can, Henelotter takes a leap over the line.  However, by that point the film is almost over, so you might as well see the rest, safe in the knowledge that it is all downhill after that scene.

""Basket Case"" is an infamous film from the midnight film circuit in the Big Apple.  The add campaign was based on Rex Reed's declaration that ""'Basket Case' is the sickest movie I've ever seen!""  When you went to the theater they gave you surgical masks to keep the blood off of your faces and this absurd marketing campaign is not that far fetched because when people die in this film they end up bathed in blood.  In fact, if anybody has seen a movie in which there is more blood thrown around than this one (note the operative word thrown ""around,"" so do not nominate ""Andy Warhol's Dracula"") then e-mail me because I still have another half-inch that my jaw can drop in stunned disbelief.

For those who have a soft spot in their heart or any other major organ for ""Basket Case,"" the people at Something Weird have loaded up this 20th Anniversary Special Edition with everything they could find.  There are a pair of theatrical trailers, a television spot, six minutes of outtake footage scored to bad 1970's music, and a short documentary ""In Search of Hotel Broslin"" (it never existed, which is why they have problems finding it).  There are also some radio spots for the movie along with a pair of radio interviews with Terry Susan Smith when she is still half asleep.  Then it turns out that Beverly Bonner, who plays the friendly hooker in the film, has a cable access TV show ""Laugh Track,"" so she shares some clips from (I liked the really bad bi-sexual joke, the rest was pretty lame).  Then you get to look through a ""Gallery of 'Basket Case' Exploitation Art & Behind-the-Scenes Photos,"" which gives you a chance to see ""Basket Case"" posts from around the world (the mind boggles).  Henenlotter, Bonner, and producer Edger Ievins show up for the commentary track, and between the three of them never stop talking providing all the insights anyone could ever want.  I also stumbled on an Easter Egg: on the main menu press the left arrow key and you get the trailer for ""Brain Damage.""

As for the sequels, I am not sure I want to dilute the experience of the original.  Clearly there is nowhere to go but down after this first one.  So join us next Saturday night where ever effort will be made to make sure that we actually end up seeing ""Night of the Bloody Apes"" (""La horripilante bestia human"" and ""Feast of Flesh"" (""Placer sangriento""), another double feature from those crazy people down as Something Weird.",1110585600,3,5116,4.577850877192983
988391,4,6305186677,"Personally, I don't get the whole Halloween/Friday the 13th craze.  A Nightmare On Elm Street (and some of its sequals) was a fairly good movie and Wes Craven's New Nightmare was even better, yet I've heard people complain about ""New Nightmare"" and the fact that ""hardly no one"" died.

  Well, if your horror film library has to have blood and ""gore"", then you'll most likely find this film acceptable.  If you want a horror film that has a well-written script with CREATIVE-juices abound, then you'll be impressed!

  For me, I was compelled by this movie; I had never seen FT13 or Halloween or even A Nightmare On Elm Street.  I was 12 when I saw this and it had been several years since I had a chance to see a ""horror"" film.  I suppose this film set the standard of what a horror film SHOULD be.  I rented it at a California video store (I lived in CA until I was almost 14) b/c of the video cover.  Ever since I was like 6 years old, I found the video cover fascinating as well as the photos on the back.  They were not in anyway misleading!  I guess I chose this over Ft13 or Halloween 'cause the video covers for those movies all looked about the same; some shadow with a knife, not a whole lot to go on except specifics with color and etc..;

  Anyway; I hate the ""20th Anniversary"" DVD of this film!  The tone of the film is interrupted by the ""menu"" and that long drawn out commercial promoting the distrubution company that released the ""20th Anniversary"" DVD.

988392,5,6305186677,"The ultimate paradox in movies, ""Basket Case"" is a grainy-pictured, clumsily shot film with almost no production values to speak of, that manages to be one of the greatest movies of all time (but admittedly not one that anybody not seriously fond of horror movies is likely to find rewarding).  In fact, even though it reportedly only had a budget of $35,000, there is so much genius in here that the roughshod craftsmanship cannot, I believe, be the result of lack of skill but a deliberate taking of the 'rough' look that has given films like the first ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" their 'documentary' type of feel to the extreme, creating something on screen that does not even look like a movie, but like....something else.  Not quite a documentary feel even, but kind of a dark vision where the technical flaws don't matter, any more than the wide gaps of logic in a particularly vivid nightmare matter.

  Graced with the most instantly disturbing tagline of all time (best when read slowly): ""Duane Bradley's brother is very small, very twisted, very mad, and he lives in a basket...until night comes!"", that brother is Belial Bradley, the most horrific, one of the most violent and yet one of the most sympathetic monsters the world's storytelling has ever produced.  A former Siamese twin to Duane, Belial's been victimized by nature but many more times over by humanity and the fates his life has taken since his violent birth, producing the most driven, most tragic, and most bizarre horror nemesis of all time.  And yet he's compelling, empathisable, even...lovable?...like there's a charming Stitch/Gon-like beast buried alive deep under the pain and scars that have driven this creature to strike back at his adversaries in viciously gory fashion.  Unfortunately, as is the risk with revenge, the chance is always present that once the oppressed starts retaliating against his enemies, he'll be consumed by his vengeance and destroy the innocent as well.

  ""Basket Case"" is open to interpretation.  Everyone I've ever talked to who has also seen the movie has, to varying degrees, perceived both Belial's actions and certain of his motives in different ways than I have.  There's one scene in particular, which I can't be specific about because it's near the film's end, where I see it 180 degrees differently than everybody else.  Depending on your personal take on the movie, Belial can even be seen as much less of a tragic creature and an avenger gone berserk, than as a paragon of raw evil.  There are very small, seemingly random happenings in the movie that seem to me personally to have much greater significance than they might appear to on the surface.  There are at least 3 equally plausible explanations to what is really happening in certain incidences.  I wish I could be less vague, but to really explain what I suspect would take a pages-long play-by-play, and that would obviously give way too much away.  One thing is for certain though - this is a one-of-a-kind horror experience. Not even the sequels (which in my opinion are just as outstanding but in quite different ways) come close to duplicating the vibe of this movie.  Nothing ever could, not in a million years.",1100995200,,3201,4.905380333951762

988394,4,6305186677,"""Basket Case"" is yet another early '80's schlock classic that serious horror film fans must watch. I fondly remember lounging on the couch at 3:00 AM during summer vacation, washing down a pepperoni pizza with a six-pack of pop while viewing this dreck. Ahhh, those were the days! As I got older and presumably began taking part in the ""adult"" world, my memories of these classic yuckfests faded. Fortunately, DVD arrived on the scene a few years ago and resurrected many of these old, pleasant memories. If you're not familiar with the wondrous magic of ""Basket Case,"" think ""C.H.U.D.,"" but cheaper. If you don't know what ""C.H.U.D."" is, I probably can't help you but I'll try. Think New York City in its grimiest incarnation, a city swarming with women of the night, grindhouse theaters, and slum tenements aplenty. It is against this backdrop that ""Basket Case"" unfolds. The movie is a warm, heartfelt film about twins who decide to go to the big city so they can relive fond memories of the past with the surgeons who separated them. I'm pretty sure I missed the Academy Awards that year, so I can't remember if this film won the best picture Oscar, but it probably should have. Who doesn't like a film about twins?
Directed by low budget hero Frank Henenlotter, ""Basket Case"" relates the complicated tale of Duane Bradley (Kevin Van Hentenryck). When we first meet up with Duane, he's acquiring lodgings at one of New York City's finer hotels-alright, it's really some rat hole where the dregs of humanity hang out when they aren't collecting unemployment or waiting for the liquor store to open. Duane wants a room so he can be closer to the three doctors who performed a special operation on him some years before. Despite the fact that the kid's got a huge wad of money and a wicker basket he totes around with him wherever he goes, the room he rents is barely big enough to lie down in. Soon after arriving at the Waldorf Astoria...err, I mean the rat hole, Duane heads out for food. He does this quite a bit, buying a huge package of hotdogs or a bag of hamburgers so he can dump them in the basket. Whatever's in there sure is hungry! Not to worry, though, as Duane is on friendly terms with the thing in the wicker bin.
Before heading out on his little mission, Duane acquaints himself with several of his neighbors and the patrician mannered desk clerk of his motel. He meets Casey (Beverly Bonner), a working gal with a ready smile and an endless stream of boyfriends. Duane also meets the loudmouth working the front desk, an obnoxious New Yawk type who bellows at the top of his lungs about the rules of the building. Forming relationships doesn't deter our hero from his special task, so very soon after arriving he strolls off to meet one of his former doctors. Only then, when Duane meets one of his old enemies face to face, do we truly learn about the contents of the basket. Meet Belial, Duane's worse half. When the doctors separated these Siamese twins, they tried to kill the lump of living flesh attached to our hero. A sympathetic associate of the family kept Belial alive, unfortunately, and now Duane and his bro are on a mission of destruction. His twin is nothing more than a cheesy looking lump of flesh with very sharp teeth, teeth he's willing to sink deeply into the necks of the three physicians who maimed him. There's an extended flashback sequence filling us in on the origins of Belial, and a subplot about a pretty receptionist who takes an interest in Duane, but the real meat of the movie is watching this weird looking puppet thingy rip and tear its way through an assortment of people.
Henenlotter's film is now largely considered a cult classic. The movie did so well that two sequels emerged in the 1990s. I haven't seen the successors, but rewatching the original was a lot of fun. Everything about this movie screams ultra low budget, from the atrocious acting skills of all the principal characters to the cheesy operation room where the medicos remove Belial. Actor Kevin Van Hentenryck couldn't act his way out of a wet paper bag, and his physical appearance is just downright weird. He's got this huge hair that reminds me a lot of an early Daniel Stern without any of the charm that that actor brought to the silver screen. Beverly Bonner isn't much better as the world wise Casey. I got the feeling she's supposed to be this super hot babe, and she really isn't. All of these people move against a backdrop that's so filthy I felt like taking a shower after the credits rolled. At least the gore works well enough, and it ought to considering most of the budget went towards buying buckets of fake blood. Still, ""Basket Case"" is amusing because it fails on so many levels. The central idea is a good one even if the execution falters.
I watched the Special Edition DVD of ""Basket Case"" from Image Entertainment. The disc sports a ton of extras, very few of which are worth watching. There's a commentary track with Frank Henenlotter, outtakes, galleries, a video short shot for the DVD release that shows the movie locations as they are today, a clip of Beverly Bonner's cable television show (?), and a few other goodies. The picture and audio transfer looks and sounds good for such a low budget movie. You'll need to add ""Basket Case"" to your ""to see"" list soon. I can't wait to see the two sequels on DVD in the future.",1086134400,,5378,4.6089676746611055
988395,3,6305186677,"This movie is just way too ugly looking to be good.  I know special effects shouldn't matter, but sometimes you need just a little bit to help push a picture along.  I like the whole premise about the two brothers.  I think they should remake it into modern day.",1061078400,,262,4.3061224489795915
988396,4,6305186677,"'The tenant in room 7 is small, twisted, and very mad.'  One of my favorite tag lines from a movie.  This is a great, low bugdet shlock horror/comedy from the early 80's.  It involves two brothers and their plot to get revenge.  I hate to give anymore away, but this is a cult classic that has spawned a couple of sequels.  I haven't seen them, but I have seen this one, and it's lots of fun.  The story is definately interesting with its flashbacks and the actors will never win any Oscars, but they really help to make this movie.  And then there's the seedy locations.  Basically this type of film making is called ""using what you got and making the most of it"".  And then there's the special effects....not over the top, but effective enough to fit nicely with the story.  The stop motion animation was a little cheesy, but then that added to the fun of the movie for me.  All in all, I had a great time watching this movie.

Something Weird Video (SWV) did a really great job with this DVD.  I was a little disappointed that the movie was only available in full screen format, but the amount of extras included was truly amazing.  I really enjoyed the piece where the director goes back and tries to locate certain locations from the movie.  Great stuff, and pretty complete.

So, in closing, if you want to see a low budget, gory, horror/comedy schlockfest that was done really well, get this movie, if you've got the guts.  And as an added bonus, get a glimpse of what times square used to look like before it got all cleaned up and 'disneyfied'.  Not a lot of footage on this, but a chance to see how seedy and raw it used to be, with it's hookers, grindhouses, triple-X theaters, etc., compared to what it is now.",1057449600,34,1722,4.378548895899054
988397,4,6305186677,"Basket Case delights me to no end.  Its cheesy special effects, terrible acting, and absurd plot keep my friends and I laughing almost non-stop.  The fact that I am almost certain that the director and cast knew it was terrible pleases me even more.  It has an almost Troma-esque feel to it (and if you're considering buying this movie, you know who Troma is).  If the movie weren't enough, Something Weird Video, in their usual fashion, heaps on a slew of extra features.  The documentary with the director and some random guy revisiting locations from the movie is thoroughly enjoyable.  Although, the scenes from the cable access show that Beverly Bonner (an actress in the film) did has to be one of the most unfunny and revolting things I've ever scene.  Despite that (or possibly because of it), this DVD is definitely worth purchasing if you are a fan of schlock horror (and you know who you are).",1048464000,3,904,4.6835443037974684
988419,4,6305186677,"Aside from featuring my favorite film line EVER (See above), Basket Case does have a few other redeeming qualities. Well, maybe not redeeming, but entertaining. The film follows a young man named Duane as he arrives in Times Square, wicker basket in tow. He checks into the seedy Hotel Broslin, and promptly sets about his task: Hunting down the Doctors who forcibly seoerated him from his siamese twin Belial years ago. (Yup, that's his Bro in the basket...) The plan hits a snag, though, when Duane meets a girl; He wants to settle down, Belial wants his revenge. There's gore aplenty, as well as some great laughs. The effects are pretty good; Director Frank Henenlotter made the most of his low budget, and the inventiveness of the effects and camera setups set the film a cut above the rest of the blood-drenched-pack.
 Unfortunately, the film is presented full-frame. Otherwise, the disc is a real treat for long-time Basket-heads. There's a commentary track with Director Henenlotter and a few cast members, trailers, TV spots, radio spots, outtakes and rare behind-the-scenes footage, a featurette, two radio interviews with Terri Susan Smith, and footage from ""Beverly Bonner's Laugh Track""-It's a good thing the word ""Laugh"" is in the title, otherwise I'd have no clue it's supposed to be funny....
  All in all, Basket Case is a must-own for horror fans, and (Aside from the full-screen presentation) Something Weird Video deserves a ton of kudos for delivering a great disc.",1047513600,,1486,5.032520325203252
988420,5,6305186677,"BASKET CASE is one of those movies that you tend to remember even if you've only seen it once. The chills are there; the scares are just right; the blood and gore nearly match each other. Plus, you've got pretty decent actors in the movie, some providing humor and some providing some reality. Casey is my favorite...she's beautiful, busty...and she's got a heart (even though she's a hooker!). But the real show belongs to that little deformed guy in the basket...Belial!
This movie follows the trials and travels of Duane Bradley and his siamese twin deformed and menacing brother Belial. They were once joined at the side...but some doctors separated them, and now years later, they want some payback...cold-blooded revenge in the least sense! Belial is every bit as angry at these doctors as Duane, but when Duane falls in love with a coy and busty receptionist (Terri Susan Smith), things between the brothers get very tense...leading up to a climactic finale!
BASKET CASE spawned two sequels, which in and of itself is a feat that many horror movies have mastered...but some have not. Although the sequels were not as good, BASKET CASE remains a classic in a pure sense. Every bit as scary and every bit as attention-grabbing as the little monster on the keep case!",1039651200,,1271,4.861751152073733
988421,5,6305186677,"An odd yet strangely charming young man, named Duane Bradley (Kevin Van Hentenryck), checks into the decrepit and seedy Hotel Broslin in New York City carrying little more than a huge wad of cash and a heavy wicker basket. Not long afterward, Duane begins talking to something, rather, SOMEONE inside the basket who snarls and quakes while being fed a sack of hamburgers -- wrappers and all. His snoopy fellow tenants eventually discover the horrifying secret hidden within the basket - Duane's psychotic, horribly mutated Siamese twin brother Belial, who is little more than a head, two mammoth arms and hands, and a scrunched-up, partial spine. Duane and Belial were physically separated from each other ten years ago and are now hell-bent on revenge against the creepy team of doctors (one of whom is a veterinarian) who performed the grisly operation. In short order, Duane and Belial seek out each of the sleazy doctors one by one to exact their revenge, until Belial  - who maintains a telepathic link with his brother - learns of  Duane's newfound romance with the buxom receptionist of one of their victims (Terri Susan Smith) and is consumed with jealousy... and lust.

Made on a shoestring budget by a previously unknown filmmaker and starring an unknown cast, Basket Case is a classic of the horror genre. The cast plays their parts with both creepy realism and understated camp at the same time, and there are plenty of uncomfortably scary moments. There is also plenty of gore, but its not overdone. The creature effects, while appearing a bit dated by now, are pretty good, being a combination of claymation, simple puppetry, and acting with  dead props. Definitely worth seeing.",1032998400,,1693,4.971731448763251
988422,4,6305186677,"PLOT: Duane has a problem. Everywhere he goes he carries around a basket with him. Why? What is in this Basket? Oh just he deformed brother that was seperated from him at birth. Duane and his brother Buliea didn't want to be seperated at birth and they are getting revenge on the doctors who preformed the surgery. Buliea just wants to kill but Duane wants a normal life. And when these brother fight more bodys fly including there own.
STRAIGHT TALK: I was impressed big time here. You don't see what is in the basket for awhile and it keeps you wondering. The picture and sound are not very good but would probably be just fine on DVD. As for Bulilea (I don't know if that's spelled right) he looks cheezy,but his face is cool cuz it looks exactly like Duane's. He kills people by ripping their faces which was different. All together a great and original flick.
CAST: The people who live in the hotel provide interesting characters for the film. Duane is an intersing one,who acts like there is nothing in the basket. Good cast.
KILLS: Bulilea ripping people's faces to shreds. Lots o blood.
CONCLUSION: Like I said I was impressed. I like to see it on DVD. Don't pass this one by at the movie rental place. But do watch out for the sequels. ...",1026604800,,1248,4.454148471615721
988423,5,6305186677,"Basket Case is WAY out there and so sick that the mouths of those watching it fall open in disbelief. This movie was made outside of Hollywood; the sets consists of a seedy flophouse (not a Hollywood soundstage designed to look like a flophouse), a 42nd street grindhouse movie theater, and what looks like an abandoned building that is supposed to be a doctor's office. The actors and extras look like they were not saleried but worked for a chance to be on film and/or a bottle of wine. There was not much money to be spent on this movie. Instead, this horror masterpiece relied on imagination and a twisted sense of humor to make it work. The story concerns a pair of separated Simease twins. Duane, the normal (normal as in being able to walk on his own and not scare people with his looks) carries his brother around in a wicker basket. The bother looks like a big glob of putty with claws and teeth. Their goal is to exact revenge on the doctor's who separated them. There is lots of blood shed, horrendous acting by non pros, and a femme fatale with the most ridiculous hairstyle ever put on celluloid.",1005609600,9,1109,4.467980295566503
988424,5,6305186677,"""Basket Case,"" directed by Frank Henenlotter, is one of my favorite horror films of all time. It tells the story of Duane, an ordinary young man with a bizarre secret: he carries his deformed, undersized former conjoined twin around in a basket (hence the film's title).
""Basket Case"" has an appealing low-budget feel to it, and Kevin Van Hentenryck is very likeable as Duane. Belial, the deformed twin, is an oddly sympathetic character. Yes, the film contains some scenes that many will find sick and depraved, but it also contains some truly haunting images. Disturbing, sometimes funny, and curiously moving, ""Basket Case"" is a truly unique piece of cinematic art.",998006400,15,668,5.081818181818182
988425,5,6305186677,"Probably one of the most gleefully sick cult films to surface for sometime, Something Weird has packaged together the ultimate special edition of this wonderfully twisted comedy/horror gem. The extras for this disc are a lot of fun, starting with the commentary (by director Frank Henenlotter, co-star (the wonderful) Beverly Bonner and producer Edgar Ievins), behind-the-scenes footage, photos and artwork, a couple odd radio interviews with actress Terri Susan Smith and clips from Beverly Bonner's NYC television comedy show. There is also a video update hosted by Frank Henenlotter visiting some of the various locations they shot at and what they look like today. But the real star of this disc is the film itself which looks wonderful and clear and is still extremely funny and features some great background characters, creepy synth music and of course, in my favorite scene of all, the hilarious fate of the evil veternarian, Dr. Judith Kutter. What ever happened to that actress? Now let's see Something Weird do the same loving treatment for Henenlotter's equally brain-damaged Frankenhooker!",997920000,2,1102,5.339080459770115

As silly as it is, ""Basket Case"" is a truly inspired and original low budget gem that is bound to force a giggle out of even the most jaded of B-movie hounds.  My only complaint about this particular DVD is that there are no special features.  I would at least like to see a commentary or a brief interview or something.  I mean, if the director and principle actor of ""Cannibal Ferox"" could be conned into doing a commentary, this film should be able to get SOMEBODY to speak for it.

The purveyor of this information was a girl about two years older than I was (who would attempt to rape me in later years, but I digress), and she was completely sickened by both its concept and copious gore. I cannot describe how intrigued I was. I rented the film three years later, and viewed a sick little piece of cult/horror brilliance that has remained one of my two favorite movies to this day.  The plot concerns the misadventures of two separated siamese twins who are ultimately destroyed by the ""Normal"" brother's lust for a woman, in their journey to exterminate the inept doctors who performed their fateful surgery. To say any more is to deprive the reader of the multitude of sickening surprises that await one brave enough to purchase this DVD. And you should purchase it. Right now. Go ahead.
