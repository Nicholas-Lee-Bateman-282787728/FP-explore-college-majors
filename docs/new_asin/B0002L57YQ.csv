2102779,3,B0002L57YQ,"I saw this after watching ""Freedom Downtime,"" and I have to say that if they'd seen the final script they needn't have bothered to protest.  The film is quite sympathetic to Kevin Mitnick--he comes out as more of a sympathetic character than Tsutomu Shimomura does (and ""wins"" in the end despite jail).  There's no trial scene, there's no garbage can lid scene (contrary to one of the reviewers, who seems to be reviewing the initial script rather than the final product)--Mitnick is not portrayed as violent in this film.  Sure, they took some liberties with the facts to try to make it more entertaining, but that was probably necessary.

Watch for the real Tsutomu Shimomura in the scene where the actor portraying him is speaking at a conference--he's sitting next to Donal Logue (the Lewis DePayne, er, Alex Lowe character), who is giving Shimomura a hard time (as the real Shimomura laughs).

It is amusing that one of the best scenes in the movie (in the strip club where Lowe and Mitnick are meeting with an ""Agent Steal""-like character named Icebreaker) comes out of Jonathan Littman's _The Fugitive Game_ rather than the Shimomura and Markoff book.  Littman filed a copyright infringement suit over it, according to Kevin Poulsen's review of the DVD on The Register (Feb. 13, 2001).",1131321600,12,1292,4.9036697247706424
2102780,5,B0002L57YQ,"Takedown and Track Down are basically the same movie with Track Down having a couple very minor, barely noticeable edits. ""Little F*cker"" is edited out in Track Down after the FBI agent gets his lights cut off; And of course the title is changed in the intro. Other than that, I didn't notice that many more edits but there could have been other subtle edits.

Takedown/Track Down is really an incredible action movie, especially if you like Kevin Mitnick or hacker/tech movies. The cons, in my opinion, is the stuff the director,screenwriters, etc made up. There's a long list of made up stuff like Contempt (Mitnick really copied the NokiTel code and other secret software like the Berkeley Packet Sniffer developed for the military to go onto a Unix system without needing a reboot to work), confrontation with Tsutumo near his Seattle apartment and other inaccuracies. It could have been more widely accepted without the inaccuracies, especially from Mitnick, himself, who boycotted the film and sued because of the inaccuracies. If you can slide the inaccuracies to the side, it really has some outstanding qualities. Real and cool hacking scenes which I wish the movie Hackers had. The big hacking scene where Mitnick does the first ever public IP Spoof hack on Tsutumo's work and home computers is one of the coolest scenes of the movie, it's really a work of art! The sped up effects, eerie music of Ulrich typing on the keyboard and accessing the system, top notch! The music is really quite good, a mix of ambience, alternative rock, it's just too bad they didn't release a soundtrack for this movie ..yet. I have made a fan version of the soundtrack that I'm still working on getting together all the songs. [...] if you can contribute any of the rarer ambient songs in the movie. Enjoy this great movie!",1131235200,6,1815,4.8173076923076925
2102781,5,B0002L57YQ,"Despite all the criticism this movie is better than most make it out to be. The only people that manage to write reviews about it are ones to complain and are offended. These people are fans of a lame hacker by the name of Kevin Mitnik. Face it the character of Kevin in this movie was actually better than Kevin himself. The real Kevin Mitnik was quite lame and uninteresting, he just happened to get a lot of media attention. If an accurately based entertainment movie was made on him it would be extremely boring and nobody would watch it. If anything Kevin Mitnik should be proud of the great character and story they made of him in the movie.

No movie made is 100% historically accurate, so why bother expecting it out of this one? This isn't a Kevin Mitnik documentary so don't expect it to be one. The movie is for entertainment and shows a more accurate world of hacking than other movies have so far. Sneakers, Swordfish, Hackers, are hardly if any at all based on the reality of hacking and computer security. Though Track Down isn't completely true either with mythical things such as contempt, it manages to be the most accurate hacker movie to date. Track Down interestingly demonstrates how technology and especially people can be exploited.

The soundtrack of this movie is also spectacular. Though never relased and I wish it was, the movie has a great mix of rock and electronic music that fits the scenes very well and in my opinion manages to outdo the majority of movie soundtracks.

If you enjoy computers I would recommend you watch this movie but don't take it that far as to how ""historically"" accurate it really is, because that takes the fun out of this great movie. Just because you think you know computer security doesn't mean you can't enjoy a good movie about it.",1107993600,8,1795,4.603125
2102782,2,B0002L57YQ,"This isn't entertainment.

It's not even fiction - it's slander.

Even from a purely entertainment standpoint, it's not very good.  the plot was thin and formulaic, and the action is sporadic at best.  Most of the time it's just boring, and when the action does come it doesn't seem to fit.

Normally, I'd still give a movie like this three stars just because it's hard to do an anti-hero type plot and I'd give extra credit just for trying, but to be honest, it just doesn't deserve it.  I did some research, and the supposedly ""true"" background for the movie isn't even portrayed correctly.  the real Mitnick was a hacker, but that's about as accurate as it gets.  He was a non-violent kid (he never hit anybody with a garbage can lid) who was arrested and held for years without a trial and then finally released.  This film completely paints him as selfishly evil when in reality he was about on a par with the kid who spray-paints his 'tag' on your car.

Overall: even two stars is probably too much for this film, but at least the acting is OK.  I think this film deserves the obscurity I'm sure it will achieve.  This really is nothing more than an attempt to spread bad publicity about someone who somehow became an icon of government repression for a generation of techno-punks.",1100822400,8,1287,4.547826086956522
2102783,4,B0002L57YQ,"As an information security professional I know all about Kevin Mitnick and what happened during his flight and arrest.  If you are looking for accuracy or facts I would suggest freedom downtime ([...]) instead, if you want a fun popcorn movie that just happens to feature hackers, this is pretty good. Skeet Ulrich does a pretty good job of playing uber obsessed but tormented hacker Kevin Mitnick. One of the funny things displayed in the movie is how Mitnick didn't feel he did anything wrong by his cybertrespass. Another intresting thing to note is although Russel Wong's character, Tsutomu Shimomura, is protrayed in the book and movie as a innocent victim and wholsesome security expert, many people feel he commited as many crimes as Mitnick and should have been in the next cell over. The same people also argue the only reason he wasn't is his exploits were legitimized by John Markoff, a New York Times reported who has written several things about Kevin since the 80's although had never met him, who was in book but strangely absent from the movie.

I think Track Down is a fun movie but don't rely on it for facts. I think it won't be long till a Track Down drinking game is made. It has the same ""stylized"" hacking scenes found in other movies which i want to bash but how else can you depict hacking as an intresting thing? Overall I would rate it at least a rent, I liked it enough to buy it.",1096761600,7,1408,4.539370078740157
2102784,4,B0002L57YQ,"Let's start off by admitting that Hollywood decorated this movie, and gives a hazy reality to what really happened. If you liked Swordfish, Sneakers, even Hackers, you'll love this movie. I give this movie 4 stars because of the false image it gives, but if your looking for a fun hacker-ish movie, this is it.",1094947200,3,310,4.654545454545454
2102785,1,B0002L57YQ,"I am glad that Amazon is not selling this movie directly and relieved that I didn't have to pay for it (saw it on Netflix). I was in the middle of reading one of Kevin Mitnick's Ghost in the Wires"" and thought that this was the documentary he referred to. So naturally I was shocked that something so cheesy would have been approved by Mitnick. It turns out, the movie was not approved. The guys who wrote this were nemesis hackers who were outsmarted by Mitnick and decided to cash in on their own failure by trying to make Mitnick look like a dweebie criminal hippie. As I watched and cringed at the horrible acting, the dark 70's-ish atmosphere, and the ridiculous story line, I kept thinking, ""Well, I don't remember that from Mitnick's book."" It wasn't until I finished his book that I realized that this was an unauthorized, completely inaccurate account of two con artists.

If you are interested in the real adventure of Kevin Mitnick, stay away from this movie, buy one of Kevin's books, and watch his REAL documentary (Freedom Downtime, if you can find it).

2102787,4,B0002L57YQ,"This movie is hacker history and entertainment. This movie shows social engineering techniques more than true hacking, but that was Mitnick's strongest point.

2102790,4,B0002L57YQ,"I give this one three and half stars. This story is based on true incidents which adds to the movie realism. We are drawn into the movie and wonder how much of this played out in real life. Skeet Ulrich plays the hacker, Kevin Mitnick, that feels hacking is an innocent way to expose the governments shortcomings. The problem is he has downloaded government files and proprietary documents, therefore stolen, files from the top security analyst and others. Now of course these files expose that the analyst wasn't so innocent either, but that hardly justifies what Mitnick does. The hypocrisy with most of this is hackers would be hell bent for justice, revenge, or payback if someone stole their software. Overall good story, acting, camera work, and directing. Check out as rental, but you may want to add to your collection if you enjoy the hacker movies. Good quality DVD with decent replayability. If you enjoyed this catch ""Hackers"" and ""Chill Factor"".

8028750,1,B0002L57YQ,"First  I apologize for having given this a 4 star rating at one time on another site. I was ignorant of the real facts behind the story of Kevin Mitnick. See ""Freedom Downtime"" (free on You Tube), a documentary with the real facts about Kevin Mitnick. This movie should be criticized for its innuendo, inaccuracies, and downright B.S.  A movie that is supposed to be based on a true story should try its best to be true to that story. This was made by people who presented a fallacious slant , a biased account of the facts. In short folks this was a bad movie from an ethical viewpoint. if you don't care about the truth or ethics or even an attempt at realizing these, than this is the movie for you. And you will probably stop reading at this point. For anyone continuing to read let me tell you that this so called ""criminal"" spent 8 months in solitary confinement , a real disgrace to the American justice system since the vast majority of criminal activity attributed to Kevin Mitnick was pure fantasy. Markoff, the New York times journalist who covered the Mitnick story, never met or talked with Mitnick. He based his articles on rumours and gouvernment claims. That  was just part of it.

  Once again, was I ever wrong about this film. I am so glad for the rebuttal documentary ""Freedom Downtime"".  History will show the people who made profits off this film as being morally reprehensible.  A huge ""thumbs down'.

When I think of hacker/computer movies, I envision complex plots, strange twists, and unexpected endings.  This film had none of that.  It was just a bunch of bland scenes put together with no exciting connections.  There is no climax or suspense.

8028756,3,B0002L57YQ,"""Trackdown"", called ""Takedown"" in Europe after the book on which it is based, is one of those unfortunate attempts by Hollywood to make current events into slick entertainment. It was released in 2000 in Europe, just months after Kevin Mitnick, its hacker anti-hero, was released after serving 5 years in prison. The script was primarily based on the book ""Takedown"" by computer security expert Tsutomu Shimomura and New York Times journalist John Markoff about the efforts to catch Mitnick. The book has been much criticized as exaggeration and hype. Interestingly, one of ""Trackdown""'s writers, John Danza, found the more sympathetic account of the same events in ""The Fugitive Game"" by Jonathan Littman more interesting, and tried to incorporate that perspective into the script. The results are thematically confusing but did result in a lawsuit by Littman against Miramax. Kevin Mitnick also sued for defamation, which was settled out of court.

As the film begins, Kevin Mitnick (Skeet Ulrich) is on probation for unspecified computer crimes, and his friend Alex Lowe (Donal Logue) is trying to convince him to give up hacking. But Mitnick is a compulsive hacker. An FBI informant tries to impress him with information about a service that would allow Kevin to access FBI wiretaps, a ploy that backfires when Kevin acquires access and listens to the informant and his FBI handler. Then the film skips 2 years. Kevin is now targeting a computer security expert named Tsutomu Shimomura (Russell Wong), ostensibly provoked by Shimomura's testimony before Congress. Kevin threatens Shimomura over the phone, denies him access to his work computer system, and deletes and steals a large encrypted file. FBI agent Mitch Gibson (Christopher McDonald), who is under pressure to catch Mitnick due to hype generated by a series of New York Times articles, enlists Shimomura's help in tracking him.

This is one of the most confusing movies I've seen, both narratively and thematically. It's not accurate, but that's not even the point once you start watching. It is 92 minutes of cat-and-mouse, as the FBI, and then Shimomura, pursue Mitnick relentlessly. It is never clear what Mitnick has done to deserve this. Although there is a mindboggling quantity of technical talk and action in the film, what characters are doing is never clear. I am not an IT person, however, so I can't say if Mitnick's or Shimomura's actions intelligible to that community. The FBI is politically motivated, which is clear enough. Shimomura supposedly just wants his file back. Mitnick is portrayed as ideological and compulsive, but with pathological tendencies. A fictional scene in which he physically beats Shimomura was removed from the script after protests by Mitnick's supporters. But we never understand Kevin's personality or what he has done to deserve this attention.

The different approaches taken by different writers are evident in the final product. ""Trackdown"" is not sympathetic to anyone. Mitnick is remarkably talented at ""social engineering"" and evading the authorities. He's bright and more mischievous than harmful. But he's also an unstable menace to society. Shimomura is talented too, and he's played by the handsome Russell Wong. But he indulges in some shady activities in order to recover his file, and he is basically selfishly motivated. The FBI doesn't understand hacking and just wants to polish its image. Thematically, the film begins by comparing the ""information should be free"" ethos to communism and ends with Shimomura doing a ""mea culpa"" to express sympathy with that idea. Despite the frequent presence of Markoff's articles on screen, Agent Gibson says they're all hype. Markoff can't have been pleased. Agent Gibson also admits that he doesn't know what crime Mitnick committed.

This film doesn't know what it's trying to say. The audience can't tell what is going on or why half the time. It seems that cinematographer Dermot Downs was brought in to spice up a lot of scenes of hacking and telephone calls. Downs has a background in music video. The quick-cutting, abstract visuals don't make things any clearer. Writer John Danza was unsatisfied with the script. John Markoff ""thought it was a fundamentally dishonest movie."" Mitnick sued. Littman sued. ""Trackdown"" was a commercial failure. But Kevin Mitnick's story is fascinating, both socially and legally. The story of how this film was and was not made is interesting. Mitnick's plight spawned the Free Kevin movement, one of the first examples of collaborative activism by hackers. Emmanuel Goldstein made a film about protesting this film, called ""Freedom Downtime"" (2001). Kevin Mitnick has written several books. For his account of the manhunt, check out Mitnick's keynote speech from HOPE 5.
