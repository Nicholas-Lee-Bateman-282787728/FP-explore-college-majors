Anyone who critiques this indie film which I understand was made on a shoe string budget,  definitely doesnt know filmmaking to say the least.  For a first time  director I think this was an amazing attempt to show what you can do on a  little budget.

But if you want to watch a funny movie with some  downright hilarious dialogue, then this is one to check out. This is a  rather low budget picture that boasts some seemingly improvised pieces, but  it all packs a terrific comedic punch. The cameras seem to be digital hand  held, but still provide a nice image. The DVD has some bonus goodies and  has a knock out Dolby Digital 5.1 track. Recommended.",966643200,2,500,4.636363636363637

Anyone who gives a positive review on this crap must of been involved in the production. Mr. Mogul, who claims to be a filmmaker himself, and gave this a positive review, should remember that the directors name is connected to this stinky thing forever. Regardless of rather it was made for Five-thousand or Fifty-million dollars, it is still awful, I don't care if the director and producers made enough money to buy themselves solid gold houses. Any so called filmmaker with a shred of dignity will distance themselves as far as possible from this weak, anemic excuse for entertainment.

196536,1,1578483050,"In a terrible attempt to cash in on both the hip-hop craze and the popularity of the ""Blair Witch Project"", this movie was recorded in 1999. This movie really doesn't have much of a plot as about 95% of it is just rappers talking to a video camera about the ""Hip-Hop Witch"". All of their accounts are different as it seems the makers of this waste of money more than likely just asked each rapper to make up their own story.
The whole spoof on ""Blair Witch"" is poor at best as you have a few white kids getting lost in New York City. The movie might have worked better if they cut the amount of big name cameos down by about 75% and actually used some of these names as part of the movie, rather than doing what is subsquently a ""video plug"". The subplot involving a female news reporter getting screwed over her story is dumb and cliche-driven. There really is not one honest laugh to be found in this movie. Only redeeming value is seeing a young Eminem for about five minutes and hearing him go off on his own little speech about ""The Witch"". Even that scene really isn't funny but it's the closest thing to it that you will find in this movie.",1060732800,2,1147,4.26605504587156

This was low budget, this was done hand held, this was done with non actors and a slew of drunk and high rappers, this had a complex albeit confusing story line....BUT it was funny, it kept my head moving, it moved fast and it had probably the best all around rapper cast films in all of film history AND it was (from what I read) done for a few grand. AMAZING! This should be in every classic hip hop cinema collector's library as well as every indie film collector's library on it's indie film merit!!!",1060300800,4,548,4.278846153846154
196538,1,1578483050,"i cant beleive artisan (the same studio that released blair witch) is actually distributing this ...
dont be fooled by other user review for this dvd. they are all biased reviews submitted by its ""filmmakers"". this is plainly and painfully obvious once you see this awful mess.
first of all, don't be fooled by the cover of the dvd. the original release of the dvd did not have eminem on the cover for a good reason. the story of the dvd has nothing to do with eminem, and its false advertising to have him on the cover. obviously they're trying to cash in on his fame with the redesigned cover. pathetic.
to give you an idea of how awful this movie is, eminem got into legal battles with its producers because he was so ashamed of being involved in it, he wanted any footage containing him to be edited out. and i don't blame him.
there is more false advertising. there is no acting by any of the rappers listed on the box.. all they did was tape several famous rappers saying how bad and evil the hip hop witch is. each rapper has a screen time of maybe 2 minutes to 3 minutes.. then the cut back to the storyline of a bunch of suburban kids getting lost in NYC. which is poorly edited by the way. let me reiterate, that the rappers listed on the cover of the dvd aren't involved with the plot, or the storyline. its god awful..
not to mention there is no real storyline in this movie. its just a vehicle for showcasing a bunch of rappers talking about a non-existent witch. you can even see the disgust in their faces as they talk about it, but getting paid is getting paid isn't it? the storyline has no continuity, no climax, no ending. i repeat it has NO ENDING. no conclusion, no protagonist, or antognist.
steer clear of this disaster.",1054771200,6,1743,4.3496932515337425

But this one was RE-EDITED and has like 30 MORE MINUTES of EMINEM and he's both really funny and gross but I won't give it away. I really liked the style of the way this was done because it parodies the Blair Witch Project in an ambitious and very funny way with today's biggest NEW SCHOOL rappers like Benzino, Rah Digga, Ja Rule and Mobb Deep. The director mock's the original Blair Witch Project's bad lighting and shaky camera work perfectly...oh and the music is incredible for a low budget urban horror movie!!!",1051920000,2,591,4.381818181818182

Bad handheld a la Blair Witch camera work style aside, this movie has so many inside jokes it's like an EXTRAS dream, if in fact your the type of viewer that likes to catch things like that. Also Eminem in his film debut is a real coupe for the producers and RAh Digga, Pras and JA Rule also. The white kids story was hysterical as well. I can see where animosity might set in if your thinking your renting a studio release such as Sixth Sense (wich they so cunningly poke fun at) but really if you read on the DVD box it professes itself to be an indie.

196543,1,1578483050,"This movie redefines the words ""awful"" and ""horrific!"" As a publicity stunt, all the rappers (and Vitamin C) on a label claim to be attacked by a ""hip-hop witch."" 95% of this movie is name dropping by rappers explaining what the witch looks like and what she did to them (explanations vary between a bad weave, to six-foot-long hairy nails).
I particularly enjoyed Eminem's epic tale of survival as he explained (in depth) how he ""courted"" the witch and ""got it on"" with her, only to end up with her finger up his... ummm...
3% of this movie revolves around the ""4 crackers and a pug"" who attempt to foul up the plot of the record company. This goes nowhere and makes no sense.
The other 2% surrounds the actual plot (oh no, I said a dirty word). Every time a rapper gets attacked, his record sales go up. Everything is fine until rappers (like the Street Don) start turning up dead. It turns out that someone is using the hoax to their advantage (or to gain leverage).
Even for a spoof this is bad. Stay away like it had the clap! The ending is not very predictable, which was a plus. However, it leaves you feeling like you were attacked by Vanilla Ice...",1005436800,6,1157,4.411214953271028

Its really that bad.
Don't let the names of hip hop artists in the picture fool you.
This picture makes everyone in it look stupid too.
The picture is an embrassment to hip hop music and culture.

To know this was shot for less than 5K and it had no studio believing in the concept-the film maker who also made the beloved COLORZ OF RAGE with REDMAN still found a way to see his vision come to light. So many in the indusrty get scared and back down and go back to washing dishes when people say no to an idea but Dale stuck with it and so far from what I read in the trades he has earned over 1 million dollars from over 50K units being sold from this film and 500 thousand dollars from 30K units being sold for COR.

7799222,1,1578483050,"I honestly didn't expect much from ""Da Hip Hop Witch"". I thought perhaps since Eminem (""8 Mile"") was in it there would be a bit of acting talent on display, but quickly found out why he tried to distance himself from the production. I hoped it would be a cheesy B-movie with some entertaining parts (whether or not intentional), but far from being ""so bad it's good"", this is just unbearable. The film revolves around rappers being killed in the Newark and New York metro areas, and features a lot of incoherent clips of relatively big name rappers recounting their encounters with the witch. Do not be fooled: this is neither scary nor funny, and while Eminem's testimony is probably the most amusing, the ""acting"" is all horrendous and appears large improvised.

The entire production is extremely amateurish, and the direction and lighting are equally abysmal; the camera work ranks with the worst I have ever seen. Much of the film features close ups of rappers relating differing accounts of their encounters with the witch, with a small and meaningless plot about some kids from Massachusetts joining the hunt for the witch but ending up in the hood. I suppose if you're a fan of the rappers involved that the soundtrack might partially save the film if you paid no attention to the dialogue or visual elements of the picture, but everyone else should be forewarned that ""Da Hip Hop Witch"" actually does have powers, but all they compel you to do is press the stop button on your DVD player, eject the disc, and beat it into small pieces with a hammer.

7799226,3,1578483050,"Yes, ""Da Hip Hop Witch"" is thin on serious plot, but it shows rappers improvising dialogue about a Hip Hop Witch.

Good:
(1) Many rappers and hip hop personalities get camera time.  Most or all of them are believable.
(2) Eminem has a breakdown when recounting his Hip Hop Witch encounter.  :)
(3) Almost-famous actors are featured, including Liv Tyler's sister.
(4) The DVD has a great commentary by the director.
(5) The movie has a sprinkling of humor.
(6) The DVD has Spanish subtitles.

Bad:
(1) Like the original ""Blair Witch Project"", the movie moves slowly toward a predictable ending.
(2) The low, low, low budget means problems with filming --- writing out actors, scheduling/crew limitations, etc.

Three stars for heart, a simple story, and a lot of characters that seem real.

Eminem did an okay job during his interview, but that is the only upside to this movie.  I hope they paid him a lot to put him on the cover.
