8493616,5,B0000CDCYC,"Buy this DVD and it will lower your handicap -- I know because that is what it did for me.  The tips were easy to follow, concise, and to the point.  The variety of instructors is amazing -- if you can't pay to have lessons from Hank Haney like the most of us then here's your best chance!  If you're like me and your nickname is ""Mulligan"" then this DVD will help you out big time.  Overall, a very good value.",1066176000,,411,4.037037037037037
