4580653,3,B0055SJYJK,"I have been getting these Midnight Horror movie packs for awhile and they always are good. But,this one...it wasn't the best. It only had 2 good movies on it and one movie was so stupid that I took the entire DVD out!",1364601600,5,217,4.190476190476191

4580690,1,B0055SJYJK,"these movies weren't even worth the $5 I paid. The movies are below grade. Not sure what else to say except save your money instead buy the mill creek  box sets that sell for 50 classic movies for $10, those are just as bad but you do get more bang for your buck and occassional winners.",1348185600,7,287,4.125
4580691,1,B0055SJYJK,"I too bought this for $5.00 at Walmart and even though it was only five dollars, I feel ripped off and actually angry...but you get what you pay for.
These have got to be the worst horror movies that you could possibly imagine.
The first movie looks very much like it was shot on someone's camcorder, Every film features really bad dialogue and absolutely horrible amateur acting.
The films for me were so stupid that it was hard to sit through them and in some cases I couldn't even finish watching it until the end.
 It is not the kind of ""stupid"" as the movie, ""Killer Klowns from Outer Space"" which was a ""purposely funny stupid"" but the only other thing that I can tell you is that I would have more satisfaction in burning this dvd and flushing the ashes down the toilet than I would returning it and getting my money back.",1331942400,3,829,4.383116883116883
4580692,2,B0055SJYJK,"Not worth buying, low budget movie and I kept waiting for something to happen.
Not recommended. Not a horror movie it's more a suspense film.",1331164800,6,141,4.68
4580693,5,B0055SJYJK,"Movie collections ratings depend on the bang for the buck. I paid $5.00 for mine at the local Walmart. The movie that made the 8-pack worth while was a comedy Zombie film, ""Zombie Dearest."" It made the whole purchase worth while. After that everything else was gravy train, i.e mostly dog food.

""Evil Bong 2"" is a campy stoner film. It is more comedy than horror and has 4 porn stars for nudity.

""Deadfall Trail"" is more of a drama thriller. It starts out slow and may be worth a view...or not. If you like those dreadful Eric Roberts films, you might praise this one.

""Demonic Toys 2"" -I am tired of seeing this in Horror packs. It belongs with ""Demonic Toys"". If you buy these packs, you most likely own this one a few times. Don't let that discourage you, as I said ""Zombie Dearest"" makes the purchase worth while.

The other 4 substandard fillers. ""Watch Me"" is a ""Ring"" rip off. ""Doll Graveyard"" reminds us of the far superior ""Puppetmaster."" ""The Fear Chamber"" is a bad slasher/detective story that concentrates too much on the detective, and ""Haunted From Within"" is a low budget psychic investigator. None are worth serious viewing.

If you already own ""Zombie Dearest"" you can blow this one by.",1329955200,21,1206,4.616822429906542
