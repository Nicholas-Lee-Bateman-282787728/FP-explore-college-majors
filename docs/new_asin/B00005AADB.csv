7935124,5,B00005AADB,I have seen this video a number of times and I recommend it to anyone studying mythology and the Esoteric Science.  Paul LaViolette got it right.  I myself found this very same concept inbued between the first two verse of Genesis.  This would be difficult to see not knowing the Esoteric Science codified to the Hebrew letters.  This cleansing of the universe is tantamount to a new creation: what Carl G. Jung would call the Transcendent Function in relationship to the psyche.  Since the universe is a mirror image of the psyche one can get an idea as to what a spiritual awakening is all about.,1314144000,,598,4.60377358490566
7935125,3,B00005AADB,"""In this exciting new video, Dr. Paul LaViolette theorizes that there is a periodic cyclic catastrophe in the Milky Way. He proves that our ancestors knew more about the universe and the cosmos around them than our history books have told us. Learn that the zodiac is a sophisticated device designed to show us the way towards the center of the Galaxy, a location that was not discovered by astronomers until 1917. In Earth Under Fire you will learn that the myths that have been passed down through the ages are not just simple stories or legends, but perhaps windows into the fate of our planet.
""Join Dr. Paul LaViolette and host Johanna Lambert, as we explore our galactic neighborhood and reveal that the Earth is periodically visited by a celestial catastrophe. Whether it is recurrent cosmic explosions in our Galaxy or the discovery that major loss of life in Earth's past may have been caused by influxes of cosmic dust, Dr. Paul LaViolette's theories continue to gain ground in the scientific community. Like the recent Hollywood films Deep Impact and Armageddon, Earth Under Fire tackles the idea that there may be disasters from space that have shaped our past and will affect our future."" -- from the website",985910400,4,1221,4.84688995215311
