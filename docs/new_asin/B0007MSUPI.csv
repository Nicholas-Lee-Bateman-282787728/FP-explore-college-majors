8049063,3,B0007MSUPI,Kids liked it since they like plaing animal jam. I thought when buying it would come with a AJ code. But there wasn't one.,1391990400,,122,4.125
8049064,5,B0007MSUPI,I love this show! I love that it teaches kids how to give hugs without invading spaces,1170115200,,86,4.117647058823529
8049065,3,B0007MSUPI,"I think this video is kind of creepy.  My nanny agreed with me.  The whole hugging thing is a little uncomfortable and you can see that some of the kids are uncomfortable, too.  My daughter, who is almost 3, seems to like it OK, but liked one of the other Animal Jams better.",1140998400,2,275,4.150943396226415
8049066,5,B0007MSUPI,"My two and a half year old is ADDICTED to this DVD.  Sometimes she watches it over three times a day.  Whenever ""Bozark"" the elephant comes out to dance she gets all excited and makes us go in front of the TV and dance along with her.  The show is very well done, the subject matter is appropriate and the concepts are easy to understand for preschoolers.  I have to admit that the songs are very catchy and well written also.  I can't tell you how many times ""Hug A Day"" gets stuck in my head when I am at work!

I understand that ""Animal Jam"" is a television series but unfortunately I have never seen it on television.  I hope the show is still on and still being produced.

By the way John Derevlany, THIS SHOW IS GREAT!  YOU DON'T HAVE TO WRITE YOUR OWN GOOD REVIEW FOR THIS SHOW!  YOU DID A GREAT JOB and keep up the good work! :)",1140307200,3,836,4.07361963190184
8049067,5,B0007MSUPI,My kids love this show.  It features great music and dance movements that they love to dance along too.  The puppets are really funny too!,1123891200,,138,4.48
