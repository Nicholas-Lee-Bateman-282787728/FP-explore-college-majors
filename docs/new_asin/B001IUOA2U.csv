3649635,5,B001IUOA2U,"Count Vladimir Dracula (George Hamilton) has lost his bite with the local villagers; the village authorities plan to confiscate his castle to make it a gem for Nadia Comaneci. Being displace, he and his servant Renfield (Arte Johnson) must go to the U.S. where Vlad will meet the reincarnation of his lost love Cindy Sondheim (Susan Saint James.) Unfortunately for him Van Helsing (Richard Benjamin) is also sort of in love with her.

Who gets the girl?
Who gets the cape?

This movie has all the elements of the standard Dracula movies. However they have improved on the story in many ways. George Hamilton is a vampire with a tan. Arte Johnson does a better Renfield then the original. My favorite scene is when Dracula and Van Helsing are trying to hypnotize each other as a waiter walks by. And look for the scene where Reverend Mike (Sherman Hemsley) is saying the eulogy over the misplaced dead swarts saying, ""When you are dead. You are dead.""",1504569600,,950,4.716867469879518

3649647,4,B001IUOA2U,"Stan Dragoti's spoof of DRACULA definitely improves with age.  Set in the late Seventies at the height of the SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER era, it stars George Hamilton as a suave, sophisticated vampire finding it difficult to be taken seriously in contemporary New York.  He falls in love with model Cindy (Susan Saint James), who thinks of him as a poor insurance salesperson until she experiences one of his love-bites on the neck.  Thereafter she falls passionately in love with him.  Dracula turns out to be a brilliant dancer, turning his hand to all sorts of styles and showing a Travolta-esque mastery of his body.  Although looking slightly grotesque in his black cape and top hat, he has sufficient style and strength to charm the women and resist any possible attacks.

Thematically speaking, Dragoti's film contrasts the relative innocence of the past with the unattractive present.  New York in the late Seventies is a violent place where innocent pedestrians can be assaulted by marauding groups of African Americans, where huge cars zoom up and down the freeways twenty-four hours a day, and whose people are so materialistic that they will apparently do anything for a buck.  Cindy likens her profession of model to that of a prostitute available to the highest bidder.  Dracula offers a prelapsarian world, one that defies time and space, and where love seems perpetual.  Hence his basic attraction for Cindy.  by contrast her fianc Jeffrey Rosenberg (Richard Benjamin), the grandson of Professor van Helsing, comes across as a duffer unaware of the difference between the Star of David and the cross as a means of scaring Dracula off.

The script has some good jokes, as Rosenberg tries to shoot Dracula dead with three silver bullets (normally the punishment for werewolves), and tries to woo Cindy in the psychiatrist's consulting-room while demanding outstanding monies from her.  The script is full of isolated references to previous Dracula films, to SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER, STARSKY AND HUTCH, and even a famous line from Eric Maschwitz's song ""These foolish Things"" (""an airline ticket to romantic places"").

Hamilton's performance is a winning one.  Continually frustrated by what he sees as an amoral New York, where concepts of good and evil, right and wrong no.longer exist, he emerges triumphant by offering a vision of eternal life that Cindy finds incredibly attractive.  The final shot shows the two of them transformed into bats flying off into the distance, leaving Rosenberg to contemplate a life dedicated to materialism..",1494806400,,2548,5.148058252427185

The song was pivotal to the scene and the scene was pivotal in establishing their (Vladimir and Cindy) relationship. The scene plays okay with the replacement song, but has much more of an impact with the original song. You wouldn't miss the impact if you hadn't seen the theatrical version, but you sure has hell would if you had. I had refused to buy this movie until a restored version was released.

3649673,5,B001IUOA2U,"Hilarious!  George Hamilton was never respected enough for his comic acting before he became the bronzed self-parody for which he's most widely known today.  Love at First Bite and Zorro the Gay Blade (ok, maybe the latter would be considered a little insensitve in these highly PC times) are two of my all-time favorite comedies.  I've owned the latter on dvd for several years now but I remember being really disappointed with the first dvd release of Love at First Bite which substituted the disco classic, I Love the Night Life, with a generic dance song in the famous George Hamilton/Susan St James dance scene.  This blu ray release has restored the hit song where it belongs, making this scene work in a way it just didn't with the replacement song.  I fondly remember how much I loved this movie as a kid even though I didn't get all the jokes (What's a loan shark, mommy?).  Bottom line...If you don't chuckle (or laugh outright) while watching this then you must be dead and need a wooden stake to put you out of your misery.  BTW, the other movie in this collection, Once Bitten, is also pretty amusing and highly watchable but doesn't really deserve the same classic status.",1471651200,,1186,4.673076923076923

Have Always Really Been Fond of ""Love at First Bite"" So I Was Really Glad to Finally See It Available on Blu-Ray

Great Movie, Very Funny & Just a Classic & Really Great to See Out on Blu-Ray ...
- Never Seen Once Bitten Up Until Now as I'm Not & Have Never Been a Jim Carrey Fan, Just Not My Type of Humor
And Although This Movie is Much Older & His Behavior is Much More Tamed Down in This Film ...

3649753,4,B001IUOA2U,"One of the great things that Shout/Scream Factory has been doing is finding some of the less than notable movies of the past 20-30 years and bringing them back to life via blu-ray. Now don't get me wrong when I say less than notable. By that I mean these are movies that the majority of movie goers out there either haven't heard of or have forgotten. But once you hear the names of some of these movies fond memories return and you wonder why you hadnt thought about them in a while. Such is the case with these two movies, definite hits on the old VHS walls but not seen in some time.

The first film, LOVE AT FIRST BITE, was the bigger hit of the two and helped re-launch the career of actor George Hamilton. Once a fairly successful actor, the few years prior to this film saw him languishing in the part time roles offered by series television. This film put him in a lead role once again which he, pardon my pun, sank his teeth into.

Hamilton stars as Count Dracula who is forced out of his castle in Transylvania and is now relocating in New York. Accompanied by his trusty servant Renfield (a scene stealing Arte Johnson in the role), he makes his way here and soon discovers the love of his life in the form of model Cindy Sondheim (Susan Saint James). As he tries to woo her he finds himself at odds with her somewhat obsessive ex-boyfriend Dr. Jeffrey Rosenberg (Richard Benjamin) who reveals himself later to be the grandson of the same Van Helsing who tried to kill Dracula all those years ago.

What makes the movie work are the tongue in cheek moments played for laughs and played well. Perhaps the most memorable part of the film is the hilarious evil accomplice laugh that Johnson uses in most of his scenes. Add to that the disco dance ear locations and outfits and you have some seriously funny moments. While it might not equal the laughs of a Mel Brooks film this one does offer a great nights entertainment on its own.

But, since this is a double feature disc set, you have more vampiric moments to enjoy. ONCE BITTEN stars a young and unknown actor who had done little prior to this film named Jim Carrey. The film features Lauren Hutton as the Countess, a 400 year old vampire who must feast three times on the blood of a virgin in order to remain aliveor is it undead? Anyway, she needs the blood of a virgin and all seems lost. Until she meets Mark Kendall (Carrey), the one man who meets her qualifications.

Its not that Mark WANTS to be a virgin. After all, he constantly tries to bed down his girlfriend Robin, but she insists that they wait. Unfortunately that means that he becomes fair game for the much in need Countess. As her bite moves from the first and heads to the third, Mark may end up a vampire himself and Robin a woman without a beau. But of course this is a movie and things never quite turn out as planned.

The movie offered Carrey a chance to let loose and he does so here, mugging for the camera in a way that would later gather him a legion of fans. For some reason this movie didn't cause that to happen but it did give him a chance to hone his style which would later serve him well. For Carrey fans this is a must have to add to your collection.

Ill say it again, while these two movies may not be the greatest movies ever made they do bring back fond memories of the times they were made in as well as the types of movies being made back then. Movie like these today would be straight to DVD releases with little or no hoopla about them. That is sad since they helped bring another great actor back to the attention of the public and let an unknown have a chance to be seen. As it stands we should be happy that Shout/Scream Factory has taken an interests in these movies and offered us a chance to add them to our collection.",1428537600,,3784,4.291316526610644

3649761,4,B001IUOA2U,"THE VAMPS are vamping big time in these two pre-millennial horror comedies.
Horror isn't the right descriptor although vampires fall into that genre. No, these two campy outings remastered as a double feature Blu-ray from Shout! Factory aim for the funny bone. And most times succeed.
Especially the outrageous Love at First Bite starring George Hamilton as Count Vladimir Dracula in full formal attire complete with white satin-lined opera cape. The fabulous Arte Johnson plays his Renfield, with Susan Saint James as lady love supermodel Cindy Sondheim and Richard Benjamin as psychiatrist Jeffrey Rosenberg, a descendent of vampire killer Abraham Van Helsing.
Dracula is evicted from his Transylvanian castle by communist emissaries who plan to turn the place into an Olympic gym. Either you spend the rest of your life in an efficiency apartment with seven dissidents and one toilet, or you gather your aristocratic sheet together and split, he is warned.
Vlad has his own comeback, addressing the torch-and-pitchfork mob who don't quite have the nerve to give chase. Without me, Transylvania will be as exciting as Bucharest  on a Monday night.
But its OK  Vlad and Renfield take off for New York City in pursuit of Cindy Sondheim, the supermodel of the Counts dreams. And the goofy dame is nothing like he or the audience expected. Still, theres fun and romance and snappy dialogue tossed back and forth, especially when Cindys shrink, Jeffrey the Van Helsing descendent, decides to save his patient  and love interest  from the evil clutches of the dapper blood-sucker. Jeffrey wants to destroy Vlad and tries very hard to do so using all the wrong tools like silver bullets used in killing werewolves. Brandishing a Star of David, Jeffrey demands, What do you say to that!
I would say leave Cindy alone and find yourself a nice Jewish girl, Vlad advises.
Yeah  its that kind of humor. The kind that reminds you of good Mel Brooks routines; there is no doubt Love at First Bite was intended as a companion piece to Brooks 1974 hit, Young Frankenstein. (Nothing tops that.) Some of these bits are definitely non-PC, like a moment with Sherman Hemsleys Reverend Mike, but Isabel Sanford as a no-nonsense NYC judge takes a bite out of Big Apple miscreants in her courtroom with style. The cast also includes Dick Shawn, Barry Gordon and other familiar faces of comedy.
 Once Bitten, starring Lauren Hutton and a young Jim Carrey, isn't as much fun. Hutton plays the Countess; she must find a virgin male to drain in order to preserve her beauty. Carrey is her still-a-virgin-at-18 would-be victim. That joke is played to death, without benefit of witty dialogue or stunts  outside of Carreys rubber-face  until you want to grab your own stake and take aim.
Once Bitten is set in 80s Los Angeles. Its the only feature film directed by Howard Storm whose credits mostly include TV series episodes. It was written by a committee that seems to hope theyll have something as good as Love at First Bite. But even Hamilton couldn't recapture that magic as evidenced in Zorro, The Gay Blade (1981), a dreadful pastiche that hits all the obvious jokes. (Its just bad; stay away.)
Whats good about Once Bitten is Cleavon Little as the Countess handy Renfield, Sebastian. He has style, wit and timing  everything thats lacking in this films one-trick pony.
Still  as in Love at First Bite  Shouts HD transfer is all we could hope for. Colors are vivid and the detail so good, we can even see the string on Vlads black flying chicken. (The bat transformation.) Satin and silk shimmers, skin gets really pale (make-up is obvious), and teeth very sharp. Grain in Love is heavy and as ham-handed as the bat and some other effects. Im guessing this was deliberate in an attempt to mimic Hammer Horror classics. Bittens picture looks more natural.
Both soundtracks have a 2.0 mono mix in which dialogue comes through cleanly. Effects are minimal and the only music of note is Alicia Bridges I Love the Night Life where Hamilton and Saint James deliver a perfect disco tango.
So  yes, we can blame  or credit  Young Frankenstein for inspiring these two vampire comedies. One works, one never did. After all these years, I found myself still charmed and laughing at Hamilton and crew. But for the price, you can add both films to your collection and never look back.

""Love at First Bite"" is the better film of the two and is still quite funny all of these years later. That is mainly due to George Hamilton's stupendously funny Dracula and a smartly written script. The rest of the cast strike the right notes of not hamming it up too much. Fans of the film will be pleased that the famous disco track I Love the Night Life has been restored to the soundtrack of a club scene in the movie. Picture quality is excellent and the audio is presented in lossless 2 channel audio. Extras include the theatrical trailer and three radio spots.
""Once Bitten"" is most famous due to a young Jim Carrey in a supporting starring role and a smoking hot Lauren Hutton playing the vampire seductress. She was in her early 40's when she made this comedy and looks positively stunning throughout while also delivering a fun performance which really holds the film together. Jim Carrey hadn't really broke out yet career wise as that would happen a few years later on the television show In Living Color. The plot won't win any awards but once again, when you have a ravishing Lauren Hutton slinking around the screen, that is pretty inconsequential. It's overall your basic 80's teen sex comedy that is somewhat hamstrung by the more restrictive PG-13 rating. Picture quality once again is very nice with colors that pop and detail which is quite impressive.  Audio is again in lossless 2 channel and the only extra is the theatrical trailer. Both films are presented on their original 1.85:1 theatrical aspect ratios.

3649776,4,B001IUOA2U,"Scream Factory continues delivering the cult classics of the past with their debut release of the Love at First Bite / Once Bitten Double Feature. Up until now, Love at First Bite has been rare to come by while Once Bitten can be found if you scour used DVD stores. Fans of these films will be happy to know they can now be easily added to their home entertainment libraries.

In ""Love at First Bite,"" when the government of Transylvania appropriates his castle, Count Dracula (George Hamilton) is obliged to relocate and decides to give the New York City of 1979 a try. He suffers all manner of adjustment problems, but finds solace in a new relationship with Cindy Sondheim (Susan Saint James). Unfortunately, her fianc, Dr. Jeff Rosenberg (Richard Benjamin), is a direct descendant of Dracula's old nemesis, Van Helsing, and is prepared to do whatever is necessary to stop his undead rival.

""Once Bitten"" tells the tale of a centuries-old vampire, the countess (Lauren Hutton), who has kept her youthful look by drinking the blood of male virgins. Since she finds this prey challenging to come by, she is thrilled when she meets young Mark Kendall (Jim Carrey), who wants to lose his virginity, yet has a reluctant girlfriend, Robin (Karen Kopins). After luring Mark away from a club, the countess drinks his blood, but the hapless guy isn't sure what has happened until he starts exhibiting unusual symptoms.

Special Features for the Love at First Bite / Once Bitten Double Feature are bare bones for a Scream Factory release. Love at First Bite comes with a theatrical trailer and radio spots. Once Bitten includes only a theatrical trailer.

Love at First Bite is rated PG for adult situations, language, alcohol, drugs, and smoking. Once Bitten"" is rated PG-13 for crude and sexual content throughout, language, and comic horror violence. One of the main paintings of focus in the movie is a nude of the countess. Its used as the primary background in many of the scenes.

Both movies are presented in 1080p High-Definition Widescreen with English 2.0 sound. Its safe to say theyve never looked or sounded as good as they do here. A 5.1 surround upgrade wouldve been nice, but this still beats anything weve experienced up until now.

Love at First Bite is set against the backdrop of the swinging and sexually promiscuous Disco craze of the late 1970s. Once Bitten is the typical teen sex romp of the 1980s where the lead character is on a constant quest to lose his virginity by any means necessary. Theyre both very much products of their times and viewers should go into them with that warning.

The Love at First Bite / Once Bitten Double Feature is the perfect treat for all fans of schlocky 1970s and 1980s horror parodies. Each of them accurately captures the decade it was made in. From the costumes to the slang and musical numbers, they're like taking a journey back in time to your childhood or high school years but with hungry vampires in tow.

and Richard benjamin who pays Psychiatrist Jeffrey rosenderg trying to destroy Dracula before he
turns his Girlfriend Cindy sondheim (Susan st James) into a vampire
i still enjoy watching this film after 35 years now since the film was released in Theaters

the DVD release by MGM over 10 years ago was barebones, just had Theatrical trailer
well Scream factory have now released this film on blu-ray as a Double feature with Once bitten
Scream factory have a reputation for adding & giving new special features to old Cult, old comedies, old Horror films
that the big Mainstream Distributors did not care about
well scream factory failed here with Love at first bite
being a new blu-ray release i expected new special features
i expected a new retrospective featurette of new interviews with George Hamilton, Susan st James & Richard benjamin if possible
cause i know Richard benjamin & susan st James have left the acting business years & years ago
But scream factory have reputation for getting long lost Actors to participate in new blu-ray reissues
such as Love at first bite
so i was very stunned this new blu-ray was getting no new special features at all, except for Theatrical trailer
i tried to email scream factory a few times about this issue on the scream factory website email contacts
but i never got a reply back which i think is very very pathetic
which tells me scream factory do not care about their feedback from fans like myself
otherwise one of the staff from scream factory would have made the effort to email me back, it's simple as that.
so obviously scream factory don't care much about their fans

the picture quality is very Good in 1:85:1 widescreen, better than the old dvd release at least
the Audio quality is the usual Master audio stereo mix, no new 5.1 master audio mix
only 1 star i give this new blu-ray waste of money i think

I'm full aware of Mel Brooks hilarious version of ""Dracula,"" starring Leslie Nielson in the title role, but I'm afraid George Hamilton beat him to it.  This whole film is a total ""hoot"" from start to finish, starting with the ""Redskis"" booting him out of his castle by turning it into a collective of some sort, with a very delightful twist at the end.  I refuse to be a spoiler, so that's all I'm going to say about the plot.  Suffice to say there's a collection of ""Laugh-in's"" weirdos to keep your funny bone in business, and then some.  About the only tension is; what are these idiots going to do next?

Music can make or break the scene, and the generic dance music in the previous DVD release broke the spell.

3649794,5,B001IUOA2U,"Shout Factory released a statement on their Facebook page this past week about this double feature DVD. ""We can confirm now that ""Love at First Bite"" has the reinstated Alicia Bridges ""I Love the Nightlife"", which was left off of the prior DVD release!""",1415491200,,253,4.7727272727272725
3649795,3,B001IUOA2U,"First off, ""THE GOOD"", I LOVE THE NIGHT LIFE"", has indeed been reinstated back into the film, and done properly (as I had feared that the fact that the release had been pushed back a month had meant that there had been some rights issues that was going to see us with the other music during the dance sequence or worst still, some re-record of, I LOVE THE NIGHT LIFE, done by the, ""MINI POPS""... ""Oh The Horror..."" LOL).

""THE BAD"", is merely the fact that no extras were attempted for this release, other than a trailer for both films (and the kicker here is that the trailer for, ONCE BITTEN, isn't even the original trailer but instead is a really bad, ""Teaser"" trailer that shows no scenes from the movie, and actually looks like something that was thrown together before the movie was even scripted, as the announcer throws out some pretty nonspecific lines about the story and does it in a way that makes it seem like we're going to get a pretty serious vampire film, and not the teenage sex, ""Romcom"" that it would eventually become).

As for, ""THE UGLY"", there just happens to be a rather nasty glitch in, Once Bitten, at exactly the 39 minute and 37 second mark that comes off as a really bad, ""DVD layer change"", where the picture stops, then starts up again right in the middle of some dialog (I tried the same spot on an LG and Samsung Blu-ray player with slightly different results, where as the LG was happy to start the movie up normally after the slight pause, the Samsung actually created an odd laggy several framed, ""Slow In"" effect which looked like the Samsung was having more of an issue than the LG was in getting past the glitch).

My question is, why did they push the release back a month only to give us this disc with no discernible extras, a bad teaser trailer for, Once Bitten, and a nasty glitch during said film (was the month taken so they could decide if they wanted to fix the glitch or just release it as is, you know, screw the viewing public, we messed up and the fans will just have to deal)?

Who knows, but there it is :(",1415491200,,2062,4.361979166666667

There are sellers that choose to rob the customers wallet just because they think their merchandise is made of golden plastic. I mean really just how much did it cost anyway to make this DVD? I bet it wasn't over $30 like what I was soaked for. New in stores, when it was released it was most likely less than $20. Big deal if you can't find it everywhere. That is no excuse for overcharging the customer. At the very most, the movie/DVD should have cost $20. So the movie is funny & extreme so buy it if you have money to burn.

There are so many good lines in this film that recounting them would be too much, but some of the highlights are Dracula robbing a blood bank, Dr. Rosenberg attempting to kill Dracula by the wrong methods, and Jewish doctors.  Not only funny, but moving, with loads of small details that give delight even after 30-odd-years.

3649862,4,B001IUOA2U,"Let's get this out of the way, right up front. The DVD does not have the outstanding Alicia Bridges disco tune, ""I Love the Night Life"". It was a great song for the disco scene, and obviously the title more than fit the vampire scenario. It's a shame to lose it from this movie. However, it's not a deal breaker as some of the people over-reacting with one star reviews would have you believe. There are about 90 more minutes in this film that have nothing to do with that song, and you'll do a LOT of laughing during that time.

George Hamilton made a cool and funny Dracula, and Susan St. James was a beautiful love interest for him. Arte Shaw was unforgettable as the disgusting Renfield. To me, Richard Benjamin ... in one of his last major roles before he moved to the opposite side of the camera, stole the film. The scene in the restaurant where he is trying to get one over on Dracula and failing hilariously at ever step is the best scene in the movie for my money.

One note of caution: some of the comedy in this movie is broad and inserted for instant laughs, which will happen. Some of it is rather slow moving, taking a bit of patience along with a good sense of humor to appreciate. The ""children of the night, SHUT UP"" scene is a bit in that vein, and there are a few more like that. But if you can appreciate a deliberate delivery in a comedy sequence, you'll laugh a lot at ""Love at First Bite"". It was unforgettable to us since we first saw it in the theater in 1979!",1337040000,,1486,4.22887323943662

3649865,1,B001IUOA2U,"The movie Love at First Bite is, simply put, an under-appreciated comedy classic.  Its take on the classic vampire genre certainly has to rank among the best and most original treatments ever made.  The film is fun, goofy, and, as a light-hearted romantic comedy, the film works on all levels... if you're in a frame of mind to have a bit of fun.

Set in New York City of the late 1970s with a dose of Saturday Night Fever and a dash of Blaxploitation, the clever script, though written in the 1970s, holds up well today.  The jokes are still funny.  The performances of George Hamilton, Arte Johnson, Richard Benjamin and the sexy Susan Saint James, not to mention the film's strong supporting cast really make this movie one of a kind - especially Hamilton and Johnson who turn in classic performances.  Hamilton may be the best Dracula of all time whether we want to face it or not, and Johnson's Renfield is pure weirdness and hilarity.

Today, the film has a definite retro appeal for first-time viewers and a boatload of nostalgia for those that saw it during its original run.  Love at First Bite really deserves to rank among the great comedy classics of the era, right up there with Caddyshack and Animal House.  I really appreciate this film and give kudos to all those involved.

Yes, it's just a silly little movie really... but a smart, funny one that somehow captures the era of the late 1970s as well as any film out there while being a first-rate Dracula movie and a great comedy all at the same time... a seemingly impossible task that they really pull off from the opening credits to the end.

But... this isn't a review of the film, but of a product - the DVD release.

As has been mentioned over and over and over, the failure to include the song ""I Love The Nightlife"" on the DVD in order to save a few licensing bucks may have ruined this film's chance to achieve the status of cult classic and even if that's overstating it, removing this fantastic song has completely and utterly ruined a classic film moment.  Whoever made that decision should be fired for their shortsightedness and incompetence.  After all, the song appears on how many 70's compilations?  It couldn't possibly have been that expensive to re-license for the DVD.

What a tremendous let down and a missed opportunity.  The disco scene, which is both completely silly yet somehow a sweet and romantic seduction - not to mention exhilaratingly fun (Dracula disco dancing... and doing it so well, a scene so completely ridiculous it's great... I wish they had taken it even farther) should be considered a great moment in the history of film.  It looks like, now, it never will have an opportunity to earn its just place among the cult classics of the era and receive the attention it deserves because the best and most memorable scene in the film - its marquee moment - has been completely ruined by the uninspired, lazy, and out-of-sync filler song they use on the DVD.

As you can see from all the reviews, it's not a minor thing.  The people that mention this and are upset by it are not being petty.  Editing the song out is an act of vandalism.

Love at First Bite is still a great comedy film without this scene, but they've ruined its truly magical moment.  Perhaps in other situations, in other films, one might be able to get away with this sort of cost cutting, but not here.

Don't buy this DVD any more than you'd buy a version of Casablanca in which they replace ""As Time Goes By"" with some cheap substitute.  Would it still be Casablanca without As Time Goes By?  No less a crime has been committed here by removing Alicia Bridges's timeless disco tune.

Hopefully, the powers that be will eventually realize they have a potential cult classic on their hands and fix this in a future release. Or perhaps they'll realize, given all the complaints here, that what they've really done is deface a great little bit of 1970s film history.",1331856000,,3938,4.580599144079886

I bought this DVD from Importcd through Amazon.  Delivery was fast, and the disk and packaging were in perfect condition.

A word to the customers who have complained about ""I Love the Night Life"" being missing:  This is a common thing with movies that use well-known hit tunes from certain record labels.  They only get copyright permission to use those big-time songs for a limited time. Eventually the later VHS tapes or disks come out with lesser-known artists and tunes. (In the case of this song, its having been re-released in 1994 might also have interfered with its use in later releases of the movie.)",1324512000,,1015,4.594444444444444

3649890,5,B001IUOA2U,"George Hamilton is the last of the great Draculas.  I didn't care for the Frank Langela remake, or the Klaus Kinsky remake of Nosferatu Eine Symphone des Grauens as Nosferatu Phantom der Nacht.  It's gotten steadily worse with Gary Oldman and Mark Warren as Dracula and William DaFoe as Max Schreck (a very real actor from the Max Reinhardt troupe that produced Conrad Veidt and Paul Weggener.  Schreck's wife played Hutter's nurse in the hospital scene.)

But back to Hamilton, he played a matinee era Dracula.  He represented a dead period of romance, and the grand gesture in a jaded age.  The now classic scene of Dracula dancing in a disco, technically it looked more like a tango, bringing it back to the era of the Deane/Balderston play and Lugosi movie, which was the 1920's through the early 30's.  Jill St. John from certain angles reminded me of Greta Schrder in Nosferatu Eine Symphonie des Grauens (1922).

Hamilton's Dracula always maintained his dignity even while in his underpants, and Renfield massaging him.  When he seduces the Cindy Sondheim character in the disco, in a worldess scene, he looks cold and imperious and she just smiles.  What would've been a shock ending in any other movie was Dracula rescuing the heroine from a world of quick anonymous sex, drugs, therapy and jealous-neurotic relationships.  Dracula looks downright misty eyed when he says, ""In a world without romance, I'd rather be dead.""

It was only natural and a matter of time to include the chip eating, always tan; George Hamilton to the mix (Leslie Neilson was the last though in Dracula, Dead and Loving It)). George Hamilton plays the Romanian Prince of Darkness in this comical take on the long history about vampires and the creatures of the night.

This classic certainly brings back the time of disco music and disco balls. George Hamilton in Romania apparently is evicted of his castle and comes to New York City. He's forced to live in a small apartment along with his sidekick, Renfield who was played by the comical Arte Johnson (very interesting!!). Looking for a bride, he stumbles upon Ms. Cindy Sondheim (Susan St. James). Persuing Count Dracula is Jeffrey (Richard Benjamin), who is Cindy's boyfriend as well as psychologist and a relative of the Van Helsing clan.

All this leads up to funny times during the latter half of the 1970's. Yikes it's almost 30 years old. Better dust off the record player and those platform shoes. Don't forget the bell bottoms. In a brief appearance, Sherman Helmsey is hillarious while completing a funeral. So if you like spoofs, even this classic will tickle your funny bone. A must have for your collection.

There is simply no excuse to remove 'I Love the Night Life' because of money, if that is the case. Is there ANYBODY who can enlighten us as to why the song has never made it onto VHS or DVD? I realize there are more important things to think about in today's world, but, for now, I am fixated on this issue. Please feel free to give me an answer if you know it.

The scene where the old Count just got depressed because he realizes that his character is ""finished"", well it is priceless.
All the actors are perfect for their roles, expecially Mrs Saint James.

3649912,4,B001IUOA2U,"Plot synopsis: Dracula, ousted from Transylvania by the government, goes to New York to seek out his idol, fashion magazine model Cindy Sondheim. Arriving, his assistant (Renfeld) locates her and the Count meets her at last in a New York nightclub. Her (sometimes) boyfriend, Dr Rosenberg - a descendant of adversary Van Helsing - learns that Dracula is back and battles the Count for the affections and life of his Cindy with the aid of NY detective Lieutenant Ferguson.

Love at First Bite is a classic Dracula spoof starring George Hamilton as Dracula. His `dead pan' performance of the main character is perfectly offset by Arte Johnson's Renfeld and Benjamin's Rosenberg.

Recently released on dvd, this was a much waited for film to add to my collection. I was somewhat disappointed by the nightclub scene where Hamilton meets his object of affection, Cindy Sondheim. The original music (I Love the Nightlife) was perfect -- I mean PERFECT -- for the scene, but was replaced by a mellower tune. I'm not sure why the distributor did this, but it ruined that scene for me. Oddly enough, the trailer included on the disk has the orginal music. Go figure.

Still, this is a great film to watch. Richard Benjamin's portrayal of a Jewish descendant of Van Helsing will keep you in stitches as he matches wits (and witticisms) with Dracula in a running battle over Cindy.

The dvd itself is crisp and clear, the soundtrack of high quality. Too bad about the song.

By the way, if you search the Internet Movie Database for this film and look through the comments on it, you'll find someone who claims they are in the process of producing a version with the original song edited back in. I have written him, but received no response. Maybe you'll have more luck.

Recommended with some reservation.

3649914,4,B001IUOA2U,"Love at First Bite, 1979 film

This 1979 film satirizes the original `Dracula' story by bringing it into a modern setting. The Romanian government has expropriated Dracula's Castle to turn it into a training camp for youths. [Fresh blood?] Where can an old aristocrat find a political refuge? New York city is the answer. There is an amusing mix-up of caskets, and jokes, that might not be used today. Dracula's servant Renfield visits the modeling agency that owns Cindy Sondheim; Dracula has fallen in love with her and wants to meet her. The sight gags are funny. Modern CGI would improve the special effects from the dark ages of Hollywood.

Dracula visits a private club in the 1970s Disco era. He meets Cindy, and they dance under a spotlight. Back at her apartment Dracula does not drink wine or smoke. Cindy's analyst (and sometimes boyfriend) discovers the bites on her neck. He is a grandson of the famous Van Helsing and knows what is going on. There is a funny scene in a restaurant, and another in a police station. Doctor Jeffrey's efforts are not appreciated in today's world. His failed attempts recall `Inspector Clouseau' The modern world does not work well for vampire hunters. Doctor Jeffrey winds up in a padded cell. But Lt. Ferguson shows up to rescue him, and another rescue is attempted. There is a chase through New York streets to the airport. But Dracula and Cindy fly off into the night for an ending that is a letdown.

There are two problems in this ending. First, even at 50 MPH air speed these two bats won't arrive in England before sunrise. The sun's rays should cause them to crumble into dust. Second, their bodies don't have enough stored energy to allow for a 3,000 mile flight. They will crash in mid-ocean.

3649918,4,B001IUOA2U,"When the legendary Count Dracula is forced out of his Transylvanian castle home by the Romanian government to further its Olympian goals, the love-struck Count heads for New York City to pursue the woman of his dreams, fashion model Cindy Sondheim. Unfortunately, 1970's New York takes some getting used to for an ancient creature of the night and his bug-eating sidekick. With a little adapting, however, they find they can still keep things going their way, even when being hunted by Cindy's would-be boyfriend, Jeffrey Rosenberg, a descendent of the great vampire killer, Fritz Van Helsing. Ever the ultimate stalker, the mysterious, suave, and sophisticated count manages to win over Cindy, but bumbling Rosenberg manages to win over Lieutenant Ferguson of the NYPD. It all comes down to a chase through the streets of New York, as Count Dracula races against time, and Rosenberg, to make Cindy his eternal bride!

Ever since I was a kid, I have remembered ""Love At First Bite"" as a fun-filled comedy classic! In fact, I believe this movie is how I knew Dracula best as a child, and it's the role George Hamilton was born to play! Arte Johnson is also a perfect Renfield. His ""Renfield laugh"" lives in infamy! Susan Saint James give a very funny and real take on the celebrity crush, and ya have to wonder just how long Dracula will continue to see her as Miss Perfect from the pages of Cosmo. Richard Benjamin's over-the-top comedy is right at home in this screwball spoof, and when he joins forces with Dick Shawn, they make a fantastic duo. I'm always amazed when this film boasts ""The Jeffersons'"" Sherman Hemsley and Isabel Sanford as co-stars, when their screen-time is probably less than a couple minutes put together! Made in 1979, this film is VERY `70s, but that's a huge part of the humor, of which there is plenty. This `70's humor was always greatly enforced by the fantastic ""devil at the disco"" dance scene set to the tune ""I Love the Night Life."" Tragically, in this DVD version (and on the old VHS too, so I hear) that perfectly chosen song has been replaced by a `70's love ballad that pales in comparison, especially since ""I Love the Night Life"" has forever been associated with the dance scene in this film by hardcore fans. Nevertheless, ""Love At First Bite"" on DVD remains a comedy must see, especially if you've enjoyed such films as ""Young Frankenstein,"" ""Transylvania 6-5000,"" and ""Dracula, Dead and Loving It."" The film is, thankfully, presented in widescreen and looks great, aside from the replaced song in the dance scene, and there is one extra feature: The theatrical trailer. It may not be the ideal ""Love At First Bite"" DVD, but if you can find it at a low price, it's a worthy buy that will provide plenty of laughs again and again. I've waited to own this movie on DVD for a long time! Now, I just wish they'd release ""The Night Dracula Saved the World"" (AKA ""The Halloween That Almost Wasn't"") and ""The Monster Squad"" on DVD!",1146182400,,2966,4.714836223506744
3649919,4,B001IUOA2U,"Despite the `70s sleaze and feel to it, this is still a classic comedy with many laugh-out-loud scenes, similiar to the Dracula spoof Mel Brooks put out in the `90s (Dracula: Dead And Loving It). Brooks must have been inspired watching this film.

Susan St. James is okay in the female lead role here but all the laughs are produced by three guys: George Hamilton IV, Arte Johnson and Richard Benjamin. This has to be Hamilton's best role by far. He excels with his deadpan humor and restrained style as the Count.  Johnson, as ""Renfield,"" still makes me laugh with his stupid laugh in here and Benjamin added a lot of spark to the film, the moment he entered as the pyschiatrist who knows who Dracula right off and tries in vain to stop him.

St. James' character in here typlifies the casual atttiude of the era towards sex and drugs and anything of moral value. She's brutal, but interesting to watch.  The same goes for Benjamin.  Regardless, all four of the major characters in here provide tons of entertainment in this hour-and-a-half.

The only reason this DVD receives four and not five stars is because of what all die hard fans of this movie have already warned you about. The big disco scene, arguably one of the best scenes in the movie, has been changed. The song I Love The Nightlife/Disco Round by Alicia Bridges has been replaced with another disco track that I've never heard before.  The odd thing is that the credits of the movie STILL contain reference to Ms. Bridges classic disco track.  Go figure.

Okay, with that said, the movie is fantastically silly and funny.  It is a delight to finally own on DVD so I can throw out my rapidly fading VHS version.  Each cast member was an excellent choice and the toungue in cheek banter will make you howl right along with The Count.

3649933,4,B001IUOA2U,"Screenwriter Robert Kaufman's 1979 send-up of legend of Count Dracula doesn't stop at spoofing vampire lore. ""Love at First Bite"" lampoons religion, class, New York City's major ethnic groups, the blackout of 1977, and staples of 1970s culture like psychoanalysis, pill-popping, and the dilemmas of ""liberated"" women. And it's good-natured enough to avoid offending all but the most prickly viewers. Two different brands of decadence effectively send one another up as the aristocratic Old World Count finds himself among the swingers and hipsters of the 1970s. I don't know how ""Love at First Bite"" looks to someone who wasn't alive in the 1970s. Perhaps curiously eccentric. It might not strike the same chord as it did when it satirized contemporary American culture. But it's still fun, clever disco-era comedy.

A suave, inexplicably tan Count Vladimir Dracula (George Hamilton) is evicted from his ancestral home in Romania by the Communist party, which intends to turn his castle into a training camp for Olympic athletes. Faced with the prospect of life in a cramped, modern tenement, he chooses New York City instead, where he hopes to be reunited with the latest reincarnation of his beloved, a fashion model named Cindy Sondheim (Susan Saint James). So it's off to the big city with his comical zoophagous manservant Renfield (Arte Johnson) in tow. But Cindy's psychoanalyst sometimes-boyfriend, Jeffrey (Richard Benjamin), is the grandson of famous vampire hunter Dr. Van Helsing and sees through Dracula's plans.

The DVD (MGM 2005): This is a 2-sided disc, with wide screen on one side and full screen on the other. The transfer is fine, but MGM was unable to obtain the rights to Alicia Bridges' song ""I Love the Nightlife"", so it has been replaced with a cover of ""The Man That I Love"" in the disco dancing scene. This is unfortunate, since ""I Love the Nightlife"" was the film's de facto theme song -although not its official theme song. The only bonus feature is a theatrical trailer (3 minutes).

I'm going to be highly disappointed if they have changed the dance scene -- if so, I might just have to buy the video instead of the DVD and get a VCR.

Now, for the debates... I was young, but I do know that we didn't watch this movie on TV, it was always rented.  Unless the videographers decided to record the video from TV before releasing it as a VHS, then I think it was on the original movie.

The movie definitely depicted parts of the 70s -- how being in psychotherapy was cool (""If you don't pay, you can't get better!""), pill popping was standard, racial tensions were still very strong, and Communist countries concentrating on Olympic goals.

My favorite part, though, was the lunchbox scene.

""No... my lunch will eat *you*!""

I swear, that's tbe best Renfield I have ever seen, bar none.

Anyway, regardless of if they did change it, it still is going to be a good movie and I highly recommend it to everyone who hasn't seen it already.",1122940800,,1252,4.362068965517241
3649938,3,B001IUOA2U,"I remember watching this movie as a kid. Being nostaglic, I went and rented the dvd version of this film. I found it amusing that ""I love the Nightlife (disco 'round)"" song was omitted from the movie. I'm sure Alicia Bridges is trying to milk every dime out of that tune since it was the only hit she ever had. No amount of money would probably be enough for her. Though both parties are probably to blame. Long live greed and democracy!

Funny thing - wasn't her song used in some lame movie in the mid-90's called ""Adventures of Priscilla - Queen of the Desert""? Maybe she's not as broke as she was then. Hard to believe though.

If you really need to hear the song just play the movie trailer. It's not just the original version of the song playing during the trailer, it's actually bits and pieces of the original five minute and forty second dance version from the 70's found on many disco compilation cd's.

Also, for your technofreaks out there, you could just burn the movie to your pc and dub the song into the movie using video editing software. You won't need to edit the credits at the end of the movie since the song is still credited even though it's been deleted!

I still find the movie entertaining. It's totally 70's and totally funny. I'll spend the money to buy it. Wait a few months though. It'll end up in Wal-Mart's $5.50 dump bin.",1122595200,,1354,4.404

3649947,4,B001IUOA2U,"Well, as far as the movie itself goes, this movie deserves 10+ stars, because not since, Young Frankenstein, has a movie so poignantly and perfectly, captured the true feel of the original classic, of which it so lovingly satires.

George Hamilton plays Dracula, like no one else (except maybe, Jack Palance, but that's another review altogether :) doing Bela Lugosi, proud, whilst still putting his own stamp on the character.

And who can forget, Arte Johnson, as Dracula's , ""Cockroach eating friend"" (he-he-he... :) Renfield, and Richard Benjamin as their foil, Van Helsing (""Dracula's stolen my girlfriend, and I think he's better in bed with her, then I am..."")

This movie is a hands down, no, if-ands-or-buts, classic, from, ""Children of the night, shut up"", to the end credits.

So why did I only give it 4 stars then?

Well, when this great homage to the classic Dracula films was first released to the big screen (I went to see it with my first girlfriend) there was this great show stopping dance sequence where Dracula seduces Cindy (""The only woman that I have ever loved"") on the dance floor to the tune of the disco classic, I Love The Night Life, but then, years and years later, when the movie finally came out to video, I was dismayed to discover that this song had been replaced by some generic disco song.

Now don't get me wrong here, this new song is pretty good, and had it been the original choice for the dance sequence, then I would have had no complaints, but that's not the case here, I Love The Night Life, is the song that defined this movie for all of us who remember seeing it at the theater, and its apparent non-inclusion, on this highly awaited, DVD release, is just another slap in the face to the fans who have been waiting for over 20 years, to finally hear the right song, put back in the movie...

I mean, could you imagine if Star Wars had been released without the opening music, but instead, replaced by some stock music (in order to save a few bucks on the licensing rights) sure, it would still be Star Wars, but there would be something missing. I mean jeepers; it would almost be as bad as say, Greedo, getting off the first shot..., oh right... lol, never mind...

We the fans, should petition MGM, just to let them know that we are not happy with the omission of our beloved song, but alas, seeing as the DVD's have already been manufactured, and will be in stores in a couple of weeks, I'm afraid that the only way in which, I Love The Night Life, will ever be heard in this movie again, is if you sync up the CD of the song, and turn down the DVD's volume during the dance sequence.

It's a darn shame, if you ask me... :(

***NOTE: Just got my copy of this DVD, and as feared, ""I Love The Night Life"" is missing in action, on both the widescreen and full screen versions (as I had secretly hoped that it made it onto one of the two versions, but alas, no :(

But here's the rub, as there's a rather lengthy trailer for the movie, included on the DVD, and guess what song is used through out this trailer, yep, none other then, ""I Love The Night Life"".

What a slap in the face to the fans of this great film, to have to endure the generic disco song during the actual movie, only to have the original song, dangled in our face, over and over again in the trailer (there are even  snippets of the dance sequence, with the proper music, in the trailer :(

FYI: you'll probably want to watch the movie in the full screen mode, because the widescreen mode it simply the full screen mode, matted to widescreen, and not the other way around, so there's more top and bottom info on the screen in the full screen mode, as opposed to less right and left screen info with movies cropped to fit full screen.",1120089600,,3749,4.38328530259366

3649953,5,B001IUOA2U,"For horror/Dracula buffs, 1979 stands out as one of the most prolific years in the lengthy cinematic life of Count Dracula.  Two major vampire films - the sensuous (albeit silly) ""Dracula,"" with Frank Langella and Werner Herzog's eerie, hypnotic, ""Nosferatu"" -were released in that year.  At the same time, the perenially undead Count also appeared on television in a miniseries starring Louis Jourdan, and took over the short-lived serial, ""Cliffhangers"" (where Dracula was played by Michael Nouri, Jennifer Beals' boyfriend in ""Flashdance"").  And let's not forget Reggie Nader as a Nosferatu-like vampire in the miniseries of Stephen King's ""Salem's Lot,"" which also came out in 1979.  ""Love at First Bite"" added comedy to the glut of vampire-related tales produced in that critical year, becoming a surprise hit and one of the top box-office grossers of the day.  Another reviewer has pointed out that much of the humour in this film is definitely pre-AIDS, and I have to say that I find it very strange that so many bloodsucking tales were produced simultaneously in this last year of the wild, decadent (and ultimately tragic) 1970s.  That said, this film - a hardy cable favorite - has lasted not just because it is very, very funny, but also because Susan Saint James and George Hamilton have a great chemistry between them and actually make their love story convincing!  I won't bother to recount the plot as so many others have done so already.  I do want to say that this film is a terrific satire on the loose-lipped, drug-fueled promiscuity of the period - Cindy Sondheim is a woman bored out of her skull with the decadent life she is leading - she smokes pot, pops Quaaludes like candy, drinks constantly and wallows in therapy as an excuse for avoiding her own disenchantment with the ""glamorous"" life of a supermodel.  Cindy is waiting for something big to come into her life, and Dracula turns out to be it.  Unlike most vampire tales, we wind up rooting for the ""monster"" to win Cindy away from her uptight, vaguely creepy, psychiatrist boyfriend, Dr. Rosenberg/Van Helsing and take her away from a New York shown to be corrupt, violent, and rife with poverty and superficiality.  It is strange how a comedy can make some very sharp points about a civilization, and this film works as well as it does because it manages to make fun of just about everything considered ""normal.""  Oddly, the vampire seems to be the only being in the film with any capacity for real love, so when the newly-undead Cindy flies off into the night in the famous last shot of the film, we cheer the lovers on as they escape into the romantic moonlight. (Classic dialogue: ""Oh, this isn't so hard!  I think I'm going to love being a vampire!""  ""There is only one problem - we can only live by night.""  ""That's OK - I can never get my s**t together before 6 o'clock anyway!"")  The hilarious script - filled with too many great one-liners and hilarious scenarious to recount - zooms along, leaving the viewer breathless with laughter and feeling better about the meaning and importance of love in a cold, cruel world - and that's an unexpected message in a film supposedly about the undead.  I wish this movie were on DVD because it is a rare comedic gem and deserves full scale DVD treatment.  Finally, I do hope that the film company replaces the cheesy, dumb, bad-disco song in the dance sequence with the original song, ""I Love the Night Life,"" which so many people have mentioned here because it WORKS!  Kudos to all involved in this little film - they probably thought they were just making a throwaway picture and instead wound up producing an ""immortal"" comedy!  I've seen this film a hundred times and I never get tired of it!",1103760000,,3727,4.739938080495356
3649954,4,B001IUOA2U,"Hope this is released intact on DVD. A very funny, charming movie, and worth the price of admission for ""The Night Life"" dance scene. As pointed out in another review the characters' behavior was dangerous & not to be recommended. But hey, this is a FANTASY from beginning to end unlike many of today's films which glorify all sorts of dangerous, anti-social behavior, presenting them as things people really do -- or COULD do if they were heedless enough.",1102723200,,456,4.784810126582278
3649955,5,B001IUOA2U,"Senor Suntan himself, George Hamilton, was an inspired choice to play the ever-pasty Count Dracula, in this incredibly funny spoof of vampire movies.  He travels to ""modern"" (meaning 1979) New York City, in search of a woman he hopes is his true love, whom he knows only from seeing her photo in fashion magazines.  The object of his affections is Cindy Sondheim, a vamping Manhattan model played fetchingly by the lovely Susan Saint James.

Will they find true love, and/or exchange bodily fluids?  I'm not going to spoil the film for anyone, but I will warn you, O Viewer, that they must first overcome the determined opposition of Cindy's psychiatrist, and occasional bedmate, Dr. Jeffery Rosenberg.  Played by Richard Benjamin, the good doctor offers a hilarious host of funny, fruity, fruitless efforts to foil the feckless Count.  All the Count and Cindy have on their side is the assistance of the disgusting Renfield, gleefully played to the hilt by Arte Johnson.

I first saw this in the cinema when it came out, slightly before I turned twelve.  I just thought it was hilarious.  I went around spouting lines from it for months...  ""Really?  Are you sure?!"" was one of my favorites, just because of Richard Benjamin's delivery.  He is so funny, I start laughing every time I even see his face in this film.  But overall, there are just sooooo many little funny lines, and scenes, throughout this film.  I just think they did a really great job with this idea.  It ain't ""Casablanca,"" but if you're looking for a really fun little film to make you laugh, you can't do much better than this.

If you are a younger person, there may be kind of a lot of dated, 1970s pop culture references for you to sort out.  For example, there are at least three references made to ""Roots,"" which was an unbelievably popular 1978 television miniseries, about slaves and their descendants surviving in America.  I'm not exactly sure why ""Roots"" is mentioned so often...  Either it was to provide a subtext of other people coming to America for the first time, or, more likely, it was a wiley effort on the part of the writers to lure more African-Americans to buy tickets.  Sherman Hemsley and Isabel Sanford, better known as George and Weezie Jefferson, from the hit 70s African-American TV show ""The Jeffersons,"" also have small roles.

Other 1970s pop culture references include: references to ""Fantasy Island,"" which was a popular TV show at the time; a few appearances by disheveled-looking folks who were known as ""hippies,"" and were omnipresent throughout the 70s; the often loud, generally plaid, invariably frightening, 1970s wardrobe of the actors; and comments about biorhythms, which were a common topic of conversation among people at the time.

Although this is basically just a funny movie, I'd just like to point out one truly scary fact that you might want to think about, while seeing this terrific movie.  You will definitely notice certain things about the behavior of these characters which seem almost criminal today.  For example, they are constantly popping pills, and having enthusiastically meaningless sex with virtually any random stranger that walks down the street.  One of my favorite lines is when Cindy tells Dr. Rosenberg that she and Dracula had sex ""two and a half"" times (until she fell asleep), but he only bit her once.  To explain why he only bit her once amidst all the wild sex, she shyly points out that, after all, ""it was our first date.""  While you're laughing at all the jokes about sucking blood, casual sex, and rampant 1970s drug use amongst all the characters, you might remember that although no one even knew it yet, AIDS had already appeared in the United States.  It wouldn't be named or publically acknowledged for almost two years after this film came out, but it had already been here for several months when this film was opening in theaters.  Just a few years later, this film could not possibly have been made without completely revamping (what an awful pun, please forgive me) the general sense of humor.  For an interesting, funny contrast, you might want to try watching a DVD of Season 15 of Saturday Night Live, from 1989.  In the October 28th episode, hosted by James Woods, they have a hilarious skit in which Dracula, played by James Woods, must constantly evaluate prospective victims, for their likelihood of having AIDS.  He basically has to ask them to answer a verbal questionnaire, before he can chomp on their necks.  You have to see the skit for yourself, if you can find it on DVD.  It's funny, in a sad way, to compare that skit to this movie from ten years earlier.

Another funny sign of the times is the way Dr. Rosenberg's moral relativism compares to the strict rectitude of earlier generations of vampire hunters.  While stalking the Count, he engages in breaking and entering, casual sex, drug use, and he even gratuitously sets a criminal free from a guaranteed trip to the slammer.  He agonizes about it all, but basically we get the message that the world has changed since the days of Bram Stoker.

But I don't want to be too much of a downer.  Overall, this movie is just really hilarious, and I'm glad I saw it.  I hope you see it too.  Two thumbs up!",1100131200,,5235,4.765815760266371

George Hamilton plays a rather hip Count Dracula and Arte Johnson his ingratiating sidekick Renfield.  Drac falls madly in love with Cindy Sondheim, played by Susan St. James, a high-powered New York supermodel.  He despairs of ever having her for himself, but fate deals him a lucky blow couched in misfortune: The local Communist bigwigs, who desire to convert Drac's castle into a training camp for Nadia Comaneci and her teammates, give Drac and Renfield the boot.  The logical choice?  To escape to America and track down Cindy in New York City, which Drac summarily does.  Luckily, she falls in love with him, but before Drac can make her one of the undead, Cindy's high-strung boyfriend Jeffrey Rosenberg, played by Richard Benjamin, interferes.  Jeffrey's grandfather -- the famous vampire hunter Dr. Van Helsing, who had been Drac's nemesis -- died without ever destroying his undead quarry, and Jeffrey is determined to finish what his grandfather started.

Rising out of his coffin and sending the crowd of mourners screaming for the nearest exits, he's out on the streets of New York searching for the lady of his dreams, a pill-popping anorexic supermodel whose picture he fell in love with on the cover of a fashion magazine.  Turning himself into a dog to get close to the lady on a fashion shoot, and running afoul of New York's Finest at the same time (hey, if you're a dog and you gotta do your thing and a fire hydrant isn't handy, a cop's leg will do just as well), he almost ends up in the local pound but springs himself and heads for a night of adventures that includes biting a wino in the neck and getting hilariously drunk from the wino's blood.  He heads down to a local nightclub, meets the supermodel (Susan St. James) and it's love at first sight (yep, and bite too).  Complications arrive in the form of St. James's nutty psychiatrist boyfriend (Richard Benjamin), who suspects there is something fishy about the competition.  The movie rockets along toward its hilarious ending and we have a ball viewing it in the process.  This is one comedy film that has stood the test of time; it gets funnier each time you watch it.",1021852800,,2024,4.612813370473537

8311383,5,B001IUOA2U,"Bought this for Love At First Bite, not for the other.  Finally, a blu-ray with the correct sound track music.  Somebody has apparently finally resolved copyright and/or royalty issues with I Love The Night Life.  It's the only song that works in that spot.  Older versions with the wrong music are not as much fun.  The movie has a 70s sense of humor, which is definitely not PC.  The flip side movie is ""meh.""",1515456000,,411,4.486486486486487
