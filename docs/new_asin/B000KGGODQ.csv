2691186,4,B000KGGODQ,"This is a most enjoyable video about the lovable Cardigan Welsh Corgis. Different Cardi owners share their perspectives on this breed of dog, and the Cardi is shown in a variety of activites like agility, herding, and simply serving as a companion animal. The British woman's segment is darling.....showing several Cardis cuddling with her in a fireside chair, and a view of the magnificent English countryside as the owner takes a walk with her Cardis bounding about her. Heaven on earth!",1185062400,5,489,5.049382716049383
8156801,5,B000KGGODQ,We have a part Greater Swiss Mountain Dog. She has all the quirky traits that we love about her. We have watched this DVD a few times- and each time we are even more proud to own her (or she owns us).,1505433600,,200,3.7857142857142856
8156802,1,B000KGGODQ,"I was hoping for a cute, descriptive show about the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.  Instead, you got a quick synopsis followed by half an hour of a 'ghost' story about a Cavalier that apparently haunts some house no one has heard of.  I was VERY disappointed.  If you want to learn about the Cavalier in a concise and well-done show see the Dogs 101 episode with the Cavalier.",1393545600,,376,4.5
8156803,4,B000KGGODQ,Enjoyed watching it even though it is a bit limited as far as real information.  They could use better specimens of the breeds.,1381363200,,127,4.521739130434782
8156804,5,B000KGGODQ,We enjoyed this episode and it gave us some info about a dog breed we were considering as a pet.,1369440000,,96,3.85
8156805,5,B000KGGODQ,"I don't own a papillion myself but they are so cute! I think this show is better than dogs 101. I know it's a little dated, but it focuses more on a specific breed, rather than 5-6 breeds in about 40 minutes or so, with each breeds segment only lasting about 10 minutes. It gives the history of the breed, the average temperament, whatever health issues that breed is prone to, etc. I wish they had an episode about shih Tzu's because that's what we have. I also wish they would release more seasons. Overall I recommend this to anyone who loves dogs a/or who is interested in learning more about a specific breed. Amazon please release season 3 whenever you can!",1365465600,,663,4.442622950819672
8156806,5,B000KGGODQ,I just love the Mastiff breeds.  They're like a bunch of big softies.  This is such a nice series for dog breeds.  Come on Amazon!  When are you going to give us Season 3???,1341792000,,173,4.0
8156807,5,B000KGGODQ,"I love the Mastiff breeds.  I'm hoping to own one someday, and this series was so helpful to tell me something about them that was useful.  Bring on Season 3!",1341792000,,158,4.233333333333333
8156808,5,B000KGGODQ,Is this one of the most beautiful companion dogs or what?  Thank you Roswell Eldridge for bringing them back from dying out and being totally forgotten.,1341792000,,152,4.846153846153846
8156809,1,B000KGGODQ,"Totally my fault for not researching thoroughly, but this video is maybe 20 minutes and cost $20!  I thought it was going to be about the breed...but it was mostly about Great Danes in movies...not informational at all.  I'm sorry I bought it...there's better videos out there if you're looking for breed information.",1326153600,,317,4.962264150943396
8156810,5,B000KGGODQ,We have a Cardigan Welsh Corgi and had seen this show before we actually got her.  We were able to share this with family members so they knew about the breed and we even got a copy for our breeder.  It's a great flick about a great breed!  We still watch it every once in a while!,1249516800,2,281,3.8947368421052633
