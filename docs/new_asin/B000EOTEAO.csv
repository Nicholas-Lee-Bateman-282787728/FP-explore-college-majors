8112472,1,B000EOTEAO,This is not what I thought I had ordered.  I thought it was the recent release about the Boston bombing.  So NOT what I wanted!,1487548800,,127,4.04
8112473,3,B000EOTEAO,"I'm not sure what I was thinking when I picked up this unknown PBS production on DVD earlier this year.  It is an hour-long program that features modern-day re-enactments of the Minute Men and the clash with British troops in Lexington, MA.  But rather than go into great detail of this historic event, instead we listen to people of various ages talk about WHY they became reenactors:  they simply love their local history and have been fans of the annual Minute Men Parade for years.

My husband is from that area which is why I initiailly picked this up.  It was nice seeing the old Lexington square again and other old buildings, albeit most was in the snow. The actual event took place on a warm April day.

Most interesting were listening to those people who play British troops or those supporting the British cause.  Combined, each interviewee has some history to tell (some are direct descendants of historical figures).  Many women and children featured in this hour-long documentary actually relive the lifestyle of 18th-century New England.  When they get together in the Commons the reenactors are in character and talk like the colonists did in that era.

There is no historical discussion in this production.  One must be familiar with this 19 April 1775 event.  The actual reenactment and parade come toward the end of this work.",1261353600,4,1345,4.850877192982456
8112474,4,B000EOTEAO,"""Patriots Day"" is about the 19th of April in New England, and specifically in Lexington and Concord; for every year on that day, the battles fought in those two towns in 1775 that launched the American Revolution are re-created by a group of avid and dedicated people.

These re-enactors take their roles very seriously; this isn't a once-a-year event.  They often spend hundreds or even thousands of their own dollars on their uniforms and costumes, and many take part in monthly meetings and rehearsals/drills.  It's clearly more than a hobby to them.  Being involved in it is almost like taking part in history, and helps them to build a sort of ""bridge"" to the past.  I have been to a few battle re-enactments before, but until this video, I never understood or appreciated the hard work and commitment that goes into these living history presentations.  It's not as easy as it looks!

Four stars.",1151971200,,901,4.811688311688312
