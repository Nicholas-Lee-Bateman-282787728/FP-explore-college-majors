8281294,5,B001B1JBK2,Its awsome but only if you have a region 2 dvd player. I would not buy this I would wait because saban has bought power rangers back from disney and im sure they will be on standard dvd region 1 very soon. Disney is a good company to screw things up! But saban is back in charge best bet is to wait.,1276646400,4,299,3.838709677419355

First the dvd menu lets you choses if you would like the episodes/dvd menu in german or english All are in  english and german Season 1 doesn't have full english. the downside is there is only one special feature witch is the live stage tour the 2 downside is  it is in regon 2 format so it is PAL if you are in the USA Witch is regon 1 you can't play it unless you buy a regon free DVD player. In short Rockin  DVD Set.,1260489600,,513,3.811320754716981
