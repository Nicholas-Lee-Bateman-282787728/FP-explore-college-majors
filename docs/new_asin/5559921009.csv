207922,5,5559921009,"For probably two years I put off buying this movie because I saw the trailer and thought, ""This movie will be sooooo low-budget!"" Second Glance is solid with a surprisingly excellent, believable script, engaging performances, and a great ending. I cried at the end from encouragement. If you're looking for a movie that's both Christ-centered and believable, this should not be overlooked.",1277683200,2,389,5.290322580645161
207923,5,5559921009,"The movie is kind of like ""It's a wonder life"" or ""Back to the Future."" It helps you to see that you may be making a difference even though you cannot see it.",1277078400,,158,3.8181818181818183
207924,1,5559921009,This movie was poorly made and had some of the worst acting I had ever seen. It was so painful to watch that I could not finish it and it went out with the garbage. I would rate Second Glance with zero stars if the rating review allowed it.,1273968000,,240,3.9183673469387754
207925,5,5559921009,Atheists like myself will LOVE this movie. What funnier than an completely over the top downfall of someone just because they aren't an evangelical Christian! Seriously what kid gambles and are parties so sinful? Please the message is so absurd it serves as the best representation of the worst. The datedness and awfulness of it is the best part. Please watch this on the internet for FREE!,1268524800,4,391,4.850746268656716
207926,5,5559921009,"GOOD FILM NOT JUST FOR YOUNG PEOPLE BUT FOR ANYONE WHO FEELS HE OR SHE DOES,NT MAKE A POSITIVE INFLENCE ON OTHERS.MORE THEN JUST A GOOD CHRISTIAN FILM.",1225584000,9,151,4.428571428571429
207927,5,5559921009,"This movie was very likeable. I thought David White and the other actors did a great job. The message is awesome. You never know when you may be influencing someone for the Lord. I know this from personal experience. With this in mind, do not give up. God may be using you in ways you never knew.",1212969600,5,296,4.2105263157894735
207928,5,5559921009,This movie is a must see for all Christian teens.  I went thru this in my life before the light of Jesus saved me from the destruction and near fatal car accident that was a result from the lifestyle that the main character in this movie gets rescued from as a result of the movie's plot.  It is great to show to an older teen youth group.,1210550400,8,339,4.044776119402985
207929,5,5559921009,"A Christian teen version of ""It's A Wonderful Life"". Rich Christiano films make no attempt to hide the gospel message of Christ and all his works are recommended. This of course is directed towards teens but the message is applicable to any Christian struggling to find the worth of his testimony. Not a high budget film but the story compensates for where it lacks in other areas. Worth watching.",1198800000,36,397,4.768115942028985
207930,5,5559921009,"I got it quickly and in good condition.  Shades of ""It's a Wonderful Life!""",1184630400,2,75,4.357142857142857
207931,5,5559921009,"This movie displays true originality.  The incredibly dated fashions and hair styles give it that wonderfully campy overtones, while the acting gives me a greater perspective in life.  Nice guy Daniel Burgess wants to go to a party, but he knows it's wrong  -- it's full of SIN!  Angered that he's missing out on all the fun (""The only thing you're missing out on is SIN!"" -- Danny's dad), he embarks on a plotline taken straight from ""It's a Wonderful Life.""  Daniel's guardian angel shows him what his life would be like if he'd never accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as Savior of all, and how Daniel's actions in carrying out the Lord's work affect everyone in life, including Daniel's parents and that closet Christian who reads his Bible every night.
This movie, excellent in its acting and plot, truly affirms my Catholic faith.  I have watched it time and time again and still I thoroughly enjoy it.  Truly, a must-see for anybody, religious or not.",1077408000,42,954,4.710843373493976
207951,5,5559921009,"An exceptional movie with a great moral plot.  Everyone should see this movie and apply it to their lives, now!!!",1360972800,,113,4.65
207952,5,5559921009,this movie was a surprise it is one i had never seen great quality on the dvd and its a great old christian movie i would recommend this especially for a church night movie and or a teen group for Christians great price too,1360195200,,223,4.090909090909091
207953,4,5559921009,This has a good plot and a good conclusion with lots of lessons to be learned in between.  It's good to see things from two different choices.  Just goes to show things are not necessarily what they appear to be.,1356825600,,212,4.275
207954,5,5559921009,"I really enjoyed this movie.  Rich Christiano's production values have improved since this film (although this film isn't cheesy), but this remains one of my favorites.  I connect emotionally with Dan's desire for acceptance and the struggle between wanting to be accepted by his peers and wanting Jesus.

The acting is good and the story has a great heart.",1346025600,,357,5.016949152542373
207955,5,5559921009,This was a great movie. I suggest it to all parents and children. Taught us so much. My teen-ager loved this movie.,1316304000,,115,4.2727272727272725
207956,5,5559921009,"I like, totally tripped out while watching this, man!  Okay, I've like watched it two and half times now and both times + the point 5 which is 1/2 of the time, I must say... yeah I enjoyed it thoroughly!  I especially enjoy the parts where the guys say ""HEY!  Jesus, man!"" as they pump their fist in a sign of unity and common purpose.  Far out, man!  I'm like, yeah... I can relate to this kind of movie.  Now, some of the acting is a little weird, but isn't everyone more or less a bit unusual?  You know, like those frozen cube people in ""Step-Sister From Planet Weird""... You know what I mean, yeah?  Hey, I think Bull was on steroids or something.  In one scene he is like all amped up and wired... Pretty convincing.  Yeah... ok, like... some oh.. wait a minute.  yeah, that angelic dude with the chick's name ""Muriel""... I'm not sure what I was seeing there.  You know, that guy was a little out there. He sorta looked like perhaps he had wandered off from a nearby Star Trek convention or something.  You know?  He sorta beamed in and out while wearing what looked like a Starfleet issue shirt.  I don't know, man.  I guess I have one minor quibble with a certain aspect of this movie.  Now, ok... what I'm talking about here is not the AGENCY!  SLAP!  Shut up Ernie!  Ok, no.. what I am talking about here is the party... Ok, the kid wants to go to this party that's taking place and all the Christians seem to be of the opinion that by going to this party that you would be subjecting yourself to ""Sin"".  Now, I'm thinking here, man.  That the kid didn't in fact say ""Hey, mom & dad.  I'm heading over to this party to chug down on alcohol, smoke the dope and commit some fornicating and thereby become an elite sinner the likes of which will put Caligula to shame"".  No, he just wanted to go to this party.  Sure, there may be temptations there... But there are temptations everywhere.  And after all didn't Jesus attend parties and turn water into wine.  So I think the premise may have been a little off for this movie but it worked and that's what matters.  I'm thinking the kid could have gone to the party and been a good witness by not imbibing, this more so than coming off as too good to even attend (besides, he may have even achieved a ""contact high"" while there due to the amount of dope that was probably going to be smoked)and no one can fault you for a contact high.  I myself often achieve full contact high just by strolling through my neighborhood on any given morning.  Yeah, he should have gone to the party but then we wouldn't have a movie.

Uhhhh... Yeah, man.  I liked it.  You know, the people seemed real and quite potentially possibly not too unlike anyone you may or may not meet during your life... except perhaps for the Star Trek dude that mysteriously popped in all the while portraying a Rod Serling type demeanor.  Note how his jaw functions a lot like Rod Serlings did... minus the smokes.  They could have had this dude toking out during his visitations... perhaps they could have simply qualified this by saying that it was a special cigarette that was in fact used for medicinal purposes and needed to be inhaled while visiting earth in order to counter the effects of cosmic rays or industrial pollution.

Ok man, rush right out and get this beauty.  It's a winner!  I thank God for such excellent movies as this ""Second Glance"".  Thanks God!  (Spoken while pointing both index fingers toward the Heavens!)",1308441600,4,3455,4.39652448657188
207957,5,5559921009,"Very nice. David White, young in this film, is looking for greener grass on the other side of salvation. Well, he sure finds it. He wishes he never knew Christ in a pardon of his sins. Thats what he got one day. A taste of the dark side  for a few nights. Then he sees that being in the arms of Christ is much more comforting and safe, than a wicked dark demonic world of sin, mishaps and cold hearted friends. He realizes the difference he was having as a christian and comes back to Jesus! What a refreshing drink of holy goodness! He appreciates even the flaws that his christian life has with the comfort that Jesus will take care of them in his own time. Happy and excited to come back, he begins to make all the right decisions including converting even the non beleiver who he was friends with on the dark side. Stay with Christ! It may not seem good at times, but He will see you through every bad time. He promised not to leave of forsake us :) This film will keep you with Jesus, or help you come to him. Wonderful witness! Hurray!!!",1298764800,2,1043,4.215
207958,5,5559921009,"This movie has a great message. Like others have said it is dated and corny. The corniest in my opinion is in the lunch room where a boy that Danny is witnessing to says ""Jesus, man"", across the lunch room to Danny. However, that just shows how there are people that are hungry and searching who don't care what others think of them. This movie should be shown in adult as well as youth groups. It is inspiring and does a great job of showing what a lack of Jesus can do in not just the believer's life but the lives of everyone the believer has contact with. Buy several copies of this movie and give them to everyone you know. Be sure to watch ""Late One Night"", ""The Appointment"", and ""End of the Harvest"".",1282003200,2,708,4.2518518518518515
207959,5,5559921009,Excellent movie-really shows you what it would be like if you decided you didn't want to be a christian-a lot of people's lives would be changed.,1281398400,,145,4.615384615384615
207960,3,5559921009,"While getting its message accross in a christain context, the acting in this movie was below average and the story line was very simple. It would have been better if the plot and characters were expanded, but with only fifty minutes of tape time, it is as best as you can get.",1279497600,,276,4.326923076923077

7802579,4,5559921009,"Even though Second Glance came out in the early 90's, it has a definite 80's vibe, from the clothing to some of the hair.  While this might seem super dated to some, I loved this aspect of the film.

Consistently dubbed a ""nice guy"" by all around him, Dan Burgess is now fed up.  He's fed up with not being able to party or get the girl or even being able to see that he has an impact on those around him, and, of course, he does not want to be known as just a nice guy.  Reaching the end of his rope, Daniel voices a wish out loud...  Enter a creepy angel (watch out for the super creepy smirk) named Muriel (no, guys, this angel is a dude), who informs young Daniel that he has been heard, and he will get to see what his life would be like if he had never been saved.

Fast forward a little bit, and Daniel is going through his daily routines and finding himself really surprised about small and huge changes simply because he never accepted Jesus as his Savior and was never changed by God's impact on his life, and thus never impacted anyone in his life.

This is kind of like a different take on It's a Wonderful Life, and the outcome is really interesting.  The film is admittedly dated (as already mentioned), some of the acting is a little subpar (but not bad), and it has its cheesy moments, but I found this movie both intriguing and strangely enjoyable.  It's actually really unique for a Christian film and quite short (it's more like watching a television episode than a movie because of its short length).  Despite the aforementioned negatives, this movie left me in a good mood, and I wanted to watch it again (haven't gotten the chance to but still want to).  I liked how the viewer and the main character both see that Daniel was in fact impacting those around him, and in ways that were sometimes very surprising.  I would prefer to give 4.5 stars but that is just not possible with this site.  I think this is a Christian film that gets overlooked, and I definitely recommend this film.

Other Christian films I have watched and enjoyed, for those wanting a recommendation:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/October-Baby-Every-Life-is-Beautiful/dp/B0099596NE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">October Baby: Every Life is Beautiful</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Unconditional/dp/B00C0YC6E2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Unconditional</a>",1380326400,2,2445,5.110552763819095
