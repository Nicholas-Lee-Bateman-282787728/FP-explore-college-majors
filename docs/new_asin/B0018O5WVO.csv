3417839,4,B0018O5WVO,"You have to approach this movie with the idea ""that it will not be like the novel"".  They have imagined lots of things that are not in the book... I'm thinking a lot about the Peter Quick character.  When the movie ends, the viewer has no remaing question about what ""really"" happened like the reader of the book.  In fact, if compared to the other movies made out of Sarah Waters novel(Tipping the Velvet ans Fingersmith), this one is really different from the book.  However, the person who had watched it with me (he haven't read the book) enjoyed the movie very much.

Costumes and recreation of the historic period are well done (except for that horrible beard wig... well being a wardrobe master myself I was a little puzzled by that one and laugh out loud about it!).

The finale (and the begining!)of the movie looks like the one that was done in Janes Campion ""The Piano"".",1298419200,3,881,4.544303797468355

3417841,4,B0018O5WVO,"I liked this adaptation on a spooky Sarah Waters novel. I am a huge fan of her writing and was a bit disapointed with another adaptation of a previous novel, but this movie did a good job. The movie is a bit spooky without being scary. The viewer can feel the passion and uncertainties that every character expresses even though the story is more rushed than the novel.",1274659200,,369,4.4411764705882355
3417842,2,B0018O5WVO,"There are three problems with the movie.  The first of which is lighting.  Ok I know is a victorian prision and it not going be the best lit place in the world, but its also just a movie so realism is not needed.  The second is the structure its a bit hard to follow all the flash backs, and some extra footage puting sceans into greating contex would be been welcomed.  The third is marking, as the ending shows and if follow the drug use of one main characters, its the story of one most  brutal assults I have ever seen.  This is what makes the book and movie much better then somthing one would see on American over the air tv or the laughable lifetime nextwork.",1229040000,,666,4.2047244094488185
3417843,3,B0018O5WVO,"*SPOILER ALERT* I'm a big Sarah Waters fan, but Affinity was the one book I could not finish. I hoped, however, that I would be able to get into the movie.

This adaptation provides a great, complex story, and the sets and costumes are top-notch. I had a couple issues with the film, though. For one thing it seemed to tap into the worst of lesbian stereotypes. Yes, we have the evil, controlling butch lesbian, and, even worse, the finale includes a woman who commits suicide because she cannot find happiness. My expectation is that in this day and age a writer will avoid stereotypes and find fresh and original ways of depicting lesbian experience. Furthermore, there appeared to be no chemistry between the two leads. I never got a sense that there was a great passion.

I admire Sarah Waters very much. However, I suspect she writes many of her books by setting up a challenge for herself. That's great, but ultimately she often becomes self-indulgent because she forgets that part of her job is to be entertaining.",1228089600,2,1021,4.698324022346369
3417844,4,B0018O5WVO,"Interesting story! As expected, it is beautifully filmed, the dialogue is convincing and the actresses are wonderfull - like other Sarah Waters stories. The actresses do a wonderful job in displaying love for one another, despite the lack of love scenes between them. I Really enjoyed the twist in this one, very unexpected! I give it a 4 however, because the end was a bit disappointing. I agree with the previous reviewer in that if you like happy endings movies, this one will likely dissapoint. Overall though, I though it was a very good movie and worth a look.",1223510400,8,566,4.7272727272727275
3417845,1,B0018O5WVO,"This was an awful movie! I am a big fan of Sarah Waters Tipping the Velvet and Fingersmith were excellent! This movie was too short, I could not connect to any of the characters, the directing was bad, and it did not give enough of the story! Don't waste your time or money. Get Tipping the Velvet or Fingersmith.",1222128000,4,313,4.322033898305085
8270222,4,B0018O5WVO,"This movie was pretty faithful to the book by Sarah Waters by the same title.  The only difference was the movie gave Margaret a male love-interest that wasn't present in the novel.  The movie managed to explain some things that were fuzzy to my when reading the novel, and it was well worth the viewing.  The book creates more tension and more creepy ambiance than the film, but if you are looking for 90 minutes of historical fiction, this is not a poor option.",1459123200,,463,4.488095238095238
8270223,3,B0018O5WVO,"Something different. I enjoyed the concept and the period was believably portrayed, but there were moments in the narrative that would have benefited by clarifying scenes. Worth viewing though.",1430265600,,193,5.689655172413793
8270224,4,B0018O5WVO,"Affinity lacks the complexity of Sarah Waters' novel and the screenwriter, Andrew Davies, has taken a few major liberties with the plot, including the addition of a heterosexual suitor for Margaret, the main character, and a different ending that works to some degree.  Even if the novel is more powerful, this film adaptation, far less dark and claustrophobic than the book, is emotionally moving in its own distinctive way. The excellent Romanian settings pass well for 19th Century London, and the well-made costumes are admirable, even though Margaret's character seems to pop in and out of mourning attire, which a woman of her class would not have done in the 1870s.  Finally, the acting and directing is splendid all-around.",1429315200,,731,5.1344537815126055
8270225,3,B0018O5WVO,"This is a good melodrama that mixes mystical beliefs, suppressed sexuality, and social commentary.  The atmospherics are strong and vivid, as is the mystery that does nothing but grow.  I had no idea how it would end, so was curious the whole time as events unfolded.  The acting is quite good, even in the production is not as spiffy as you expect from Hollywood.  Recommended as a nice passtime.",1425600000,,397,4.7101449275362315

8270227,5,B0018O5WVO,This movie is so intriging. The story is awesome yet heart breaking at the same time. I love it! The twist was crazy!,1356998400,3,117,4.130434782608695
8270228,2,B0018O5WVO,"Never thought I'd say this: a film with a lesbian subplot that can cure insomnia. I have not read any of Sarah Waters' novels, but this is the third movie I've watched that was based on them and I'm beginning to think that Waters has a poor opinion of women and lesbians (albeit disguised in her smoke and mirrors). In this convoluted suspense story, the female characters are crooks, swindlers, gullible, lonely, controlling, violent, desperate, suicidal -- and in one important scene, sexual molesters. If this was also the novel, then it's a mystery to me how Waters has managed to gain a loyal following of lesbian and feminist readers.",1319068800,,640,4.827272727272727
8270229,2,B0018O5WVO,"This film version of Sarah Waters' brilliant novel ""Affinity"" seemed rushed and muddled and had very little emotional impact on me. I recognize that it must have been challenging to adapt the book, whose strengths are its detailed character development and slow ratcheting up of psychological tension. Although the book has action scenes and dialogue, much of the story is built on the internal thought processes of characters which cannot be as easily conveyed in a movie.

The film's use of flashbacks to show the backgrounds of the main characters (a device used effectively in the book to slowly reveal character and keep you on edge) were too fleeting and, even for someone who has read the book, confusing. Two other weaknesses undermine it. The lead actresses, altho lovely to look at, are sort of one-note, not very subtle actors and I didn't feel any chemistry between them that would support them developing a real passion for each other (which is rather crucial to the concept of ""Affinity""!). There is also a third character who plays a critical role in the story who is only brought in minimally at the very end of the movie. If you haven't read the book, you are likely to wonder where the heck she suddenly came from and what her motivations are/were. I wonder whether they shot additional scenes with her that maybe ended up on the cutting room floor, because her placement in the movie just seems so clumsy.

The special features section of the DVD includes interviews with the director, producer and screenwriter (the great Andrew Davies, who penned the excellent screen versions of ""Pride & Prejudice,"" ""Bleak House"" and ""Little Dorrit""). I couldn't help thinking as I listened to these three men repeatedly refer to the women characters as ""girls"" and make simplistic statements about female needs and desires that the whole project would have benefitted from having women at the helm.

Sarah Waters' book ""Affinity"" is a really gripping, emotional story. Skip this video and read the book.

8270230,5,B0018O5WVO,"The acting and the sets are wonderful. Generally, the movie is faithful to Sarah Waters' novel; unusually, I would say it improves on and enhances the work it is adapted from. The special features include excellent interviews with the author, the scriptwriter, the director and two of the actors which add tremendously to appreciation of the work.",1309564800,2,347,5.105263157894737
8270231,5,B0018O5WVO,"How marvelous to find a modern British drama unshrouded by multiculti or other manifestations of political correctness!  This is a straight-out suspense story that manages to float elements of supernaturalism and existentialism into a well-paced plot that glides smoothly from the haut monde to the demimonde, from rococo parlors to rock-walled prison cells.
No rose-colored lens distorts this stark vision of Victorian society.  Strict morality and convention may cast a pall over one's hopes, but so may the spector of spiritual and physical poverty.  Naivete and sexual frustration can prove to be as dangerous as material deprivation and desperation.
Superbly acted and directed, this drama hosts a cast of multidimensional characters whose depictions may startle and even disquiet contemporary viewers who are accustomed to sensitive treatment of subcultural portrayals.  Such unflinching grittiness, however, adds layers of possibilities to a plot that digs deep into the underworld of a strait-laced society.
Surprises and plot twists abound as the protagonist--as well as compliant viewers--allow themselves to wonder just what is possible in this cinematic dimension.  What, if anything, is real in this particular realm?  Apparitions?  Clairvoyance?  Autokinesis?  Each audience member should have a self-satisfying answer by film's end.",1301875200,2,1347,5.831632653061225
