5190528,5,B008Y5OXB0,"An interesting portrayal of the hasher realities of medieval life. In the spirit of Chaucer and his predecessors.
Also, a neat glimpse of 1960's spritual growth from the midst of 1950's repression, which parallel's the spritual movement out of the repression of the medieval times as well.",1358380800,5,289,5.170212765957447

5190530,4,B008Y5OXB0,"I remember seeing ""The Canterbury Tales"" in Summer, 1973 a year after the film was released. It was interesting to see it again after almost 40 years. Pasolini offers a more ordered film than say Fellini. What I would have liked to see was an English dubbed track to assist with watching ""The Decameron"" and ""The Arabian Nights.""

5190541,5,B008Y5OXB0,"Pasolini has chosen three tales that have lived for ages, and given them new life.  I love many of the European films because they depend on acting and story instead of special effects. I don't speak or understand Italian, but you don't have to to get the entire visual story and see the emotions in the faces.  For the serious student of film, these are classics in the true sense.  A must.",1397692800,5,391,4.402777777777778

5190544,5,B008Y5OXB0,"These are great stories brought to life as only Pasolini could have done.

The other tales are also compelling in their settings and realistic composure.  Beautiful set, really.",1376006400,,321,5.235294117647059
5190545,4,B008Y5OXB0,I have been looking for these films for a long time. I've only seen a poor quality VHS of THE DECAMERON that I found in my local public library. Criterion Collection has done a great job compiling this collection together! The quality is top-notich and the booklet that comes with it is very informative.

5190546,3,B008Y5OXB0,"Don't get this thinking it will be great to show to Lit classes.  This film-maker is intensely focused on portraying the stories as they were told.  Full-frontal nudity for men and women is the norm.  This is not to say that the trilogy even remotely seems like an attempt at pornography.  On the contrary, this is a true art film that takes scrupulous pains to bring these stories to visual life.  But it makes no compromise with the censors in doing so.  The direction seems to be deeply concerned with the grittiness of the real world that these tales occupied in direct contrast to most of the classical literature surrounding it contemporaneously. Therefore, be warned before you buy.",1373932800,7,689,4.796610169491525
5190547,5,B008Y5OXB0,"Pasolini holds a special place for me in the canon, not on a technical or even artistic level, but as real and as human a filmmaker as ever worked. It's splendid that Criterion has taken these films, restored them, explained them, and given them better subtitles that some of the older versions. Truly a masterful work, the Trilogy of Life deals with sex, murder, inequity, disappointment, reward, honor, truth, lies, fate, will-- in ways that are distasteful, and happily so-- just like, well, life... Along with Salo, the extreme denial of life and the terror of pragmatic manipulation, I have never seen anything that so honestly and openly defies all suppositions, even at its cinematic worst. Thank God for Criterion! Now, if they could get to work on the rest of Pier Paolo's catalogue, I'd gladly make them a couple hundred dollars richer; for my subsequent poverty, I have Pasolini.",1370649600,5,890,4.94
5190548,5,B008Y5OXB0,"If you are planning to order these BDs, chances are you need no introduction to Pasolini's Trilogy of Life.(*1)

I first watched these films during my college years, and was immediately drawn to Pasolini's very unconventional film-making techniques.(*2) Thus, when these were up for sale last November from the redoubtable Criterion Collection, I preordered the blu-ray set. The ""Criterion magic"" does not disappoint, but.... If memory serves, there are more than 3 or 4 instances when vertical red straight lines appear prominently in the Canterbury Tales.(*3) So here is the puzzle: Why are they (still) there after the careful restoration?

I love Criterion Collection. Even though their products are more expensive, they are almost always worth the additional cost. In particular, these are great improvements from BFI's Region B (UK) blu-ray releases in terms of clarity, contrast, color scheme and especially naturality of the skin tone. So they are really currently the best transfer for these films. However, these vertical red lines are distracting, for me at least. (They are not present in BFI's edition.) I imagine one reason they are there (after the restoration) is that the current digital restoration technology is not advanced enough to remove these lines without compromising the entire frames. However, that theory doesn't seem convincing as Criterion Collection has in the past fixed tears and scratches more serious than these lines. An email inquiry to Criterion Collection did not produce a satisfactory answer. ""The lines are in the source material"" was all I was told. Maybe I am spoiled, but I have come to expect only the highest quality from Criterion.

If anyone has an answer, I'd be curious to know. In particular, if you happen to be or know one of the Criterion Collection's technicians in charge of the restoration, help us solve the puzzle!

Still highly recommended, for the films and for the (otherwise excellent) transfer.(*4)

(*2) For example, the editing is not at all smooth or tidy (but quite effective). Nudities and sex are treated in a ""casual"" and ""naturalistic"" way, devoid of the usual sentimental eroticism.

(*3) They are played on an Oppo BD player connected via a HDMI cable to an 65-inch HDTV. So I think the playback equipment is adequate.

(*4) Pasolini edited Canterbury Tales and Arabian Nights more than once and the ""final"" cuts are shorter than the ""original"" cuts presented in Berlin and Cannes Film Festivals. The Criterion Collection films are the final cuts, which Pasolini preferred. (These are also explained in the documentaries in the box.)",1366329600,22,3065,5.5905172413793105
5190549,4,B008Y5OXB0,"I'd seen these Passolini films way back when they'd first come out while a liberal California university student and awaiting the draft . . .  Well, I was never drafted, earned a useless degree while waiting, and even became a member of the GOP, yet I had fond memories of those early 70's and snapped up this Trilogy of Life set as a reminder of those confusing/exciting/violent days.

Now that my head is clearer, I can almost understand what Passolini was trying to do - sort of - and these blu-ray discs are of much better quality than the art-house films I'd originally seen.  I'm happy with this purchase and would recommend this collection to any current or formally liberalized college kid who doesn't mind captions or speaks Italian.  They're still fun, outrageous, controversial and come with deleted scenes we'd only speculated about back then (no, there's no hardcore sex after all).  You should be a fan of foreign films with their typical rough editing (leading we besotted college guys with visions of erotic things never filmed), and specifically enjoy Passolini's early 70's work.",1363737600,4,1097,4.940217391304348

8532401,5,B008Y5OXB0,"I have puzzled over Pasolini's THE CANTERBURY TALES since I first saw it in 1977. That version had English credits, was dubbed in English and ran around two hours. When it first appeared on VHS courtesy of Waterbearer Films, it was virtually the same as what I saw but the picture quality was so-so. The earliest DVDs were of the Italian version which had a better picture but only ran 112 minutes. Later English dubbed versions were also this length. Obviously footage was missing. Now thanks to Criterion's usual plethora of extras, the mystery is finally solved. A special feature on this set details the different versions. The director's cut that was first shown at the 1972 Berlin Film Festival ran 137 minutes and then was edited to 117 minutes (the version I saw). Pasolini later edited the film to 111 minutes and changed the order of the stories. He also removed the interconnecting segments which helps to explain the choppy quality of some of the editing and the confusion in following the various tales.

I saw the English language version of this movie when it first played in U.S. theaters . There was no NC-17 rating back in the 1970s and so the film was rated X yet it managed to play in a cinema multiplex rather than the typical X rated theater. I watched as within the first hour virtually everyone walked out of the film. Those who came expecting a MASTERPIECE THEATRE version of Chaucer were scandalized (they obviously didn't check the movie's rating beforehand) and those expecting a porno version of classic literature (remember GRIMM'S FAIRY TALES FOR ADULTS?) didn't get the sex they were looking for. While there were sex scenes, it was the full frontal male nudity that got the X rating (the same as today). That and the infamous ending which still has to be seen to be believed. So does a fully nude, pre-DR WHO Tom Baker in the WIFE OF BATH'S TALE.

The film was made in several of Chaucer's English locations giving the stories a real sense of verisimilitude. The fact that Sergio Leone's regular cameraman Tonino Delli Colli was also Pasolini's regular cameraman accounts for the movie's striking visual quality (this is also true of the other two films in the TRILOGY). Yes the performances are uneven and the dubbing is occasionally haphazard but that doesn't take away from the film's overall effectiveness. Pasolini was going through personal problems when he made the film (he and his longtime partner Ninetto Davoli who plays the Chaplinesque character were splitting up) and as a result he kept changing his mind about it. Apparently the 137 minute Berlin version no longer exists. That's too bad as, judging from the stills, it would be fascinating to see. All of these details and more are in the Special Features section. DECAMERON and ARABIAN NIGHTS have supplements as well. It is all this extra material and the stunning visual quality of all 3 films that make this Criterion set an absolute must for fans of Pasolini. For those unfamiliar with him, there is no better place to start out.",1479081600,,3034,4.788167938931298
