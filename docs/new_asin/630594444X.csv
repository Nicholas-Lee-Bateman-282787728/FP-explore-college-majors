The star line-up of actors, writers, and directors explaining their parts in the various films outlined is worth the price of addmission.

But be warned: You'll want to race right out and buy everyone of George Pal's films after you view this great DVD. Hats off to Arnold Leibovit.",969494400,13,424,4.592105263157895
2750747,5,630594444X,"The Fantasy Film Worlds of George Pal is truly worlds of wonder!  Arnold  Leibovit, producer of this marvelous documentary, has done a wonderful job  at encapsulating the colorful life and career of producer/director George  Pal - from his meager beginnings as a cartoon artist, through his years of  creating the stop-motion animated short films, fancifully named  ""Puppetoons"", and into his wonderful works of feature motion  pictures.  The documentary guides us with affection through Pal's career,  by way of interviews with the cast, crew and peers of his films, and  includes interviews with Pal himself.  His work touches a cord within all  of us - the child that lives within and is dazzled by science and fantasy,  prophetic visions and flights of fancy.  All who have known or worked with  him remember Pal with delight - ""He was a sweet, sweet man;  ...a  gentle man."", as Tony Randel puts it when telling of his experience of  working with Pal.  This was a sentiment felt by all who have had the honor  of knowing and working with Pal.  This documentary thoroughly captures the  whimsy and kind heart of a man who not only was a dreamer, but was one who  inspired us to dream.  People like George Lucas and Steven Spielberg only  stand on Pal's shoulders, and continue the line of imaginative filmmaking  which he started.  The contemporary term ""eye candy"" can so  easily be applied to this documentary, for it is a treat to see this  montage of works by the master that started it all.  Thanks George!  And  thank you Arnold Leibovit, for giving us this special and delightful  glimpse into the life and works of a man who will never be forgotten!  The  Fantasy Film Worlds of George Pal was obviously a labor of love!",969148800,16,1732,4.736486486486487
2750748,5,630594444X,"I originally saw Arnold Leibovit's documentary, ""The Fantasy Film Worlds of George Pal,"" a dozen or so years ago, and it has not dimmed  in the years since. In fact, the extra footage and the new clarity have  only improved the experience of seeing this great man's legacy. Leibovit's  affectionate treatment of his subject is like a throwback to a more  respectful era.",967680000,,370,4.825396825396825
2750749,5,630594444X,"A great documentary detailing the animation and films of special effects pioneer George Pal.  Included are interviews with actors, technicians and the master himself along with clips from some of his classic works.
An  early proponent of stop-motion animation, George Pal created a series of  short films in the 1940s for Paramount with the Puppetoons, a forerunner to  the claymation technique used in ""Chicken Run"".
Turning to  science fiction, Pal gave us some of the great 1950s classics such as  ""When Worlds Collide"", ""Destination Moon"" and ""The  War of the Worlds"", which was the basis for the 1996 blockbuster  ""Independence Day"".
This DVD details the creative force  behind these films with rare behind the scenes footage of the creation of  his Oscar winning special effects.
""The Fantasy Worlds of George  Pal"" will show you how many of today's great filmakers were inspired  by his work.  A fascinating film made only better by a crisp DVD transfer.  Check it out!",962150400,7,976,5.056603773584905

8173165,5,630594444X,"He brought so much joy to so many people in his lifetime. He had an eye for the fantastic and the fascinating. Starting with ""Destination Moon"" and ending with ""The Power"" Pal gave us - fans of science fiction - a glimpse of the possible in cinematic storytelling. I wish there were more of him around today. Instead of so many CGI effects thrown at us, we'd have good stories, too. Still, he left so many great films that bear a second or third look.",1457568000,,451,4.317647058823529

8173169,5,630594444X,"There will likely never be another filmmaker or artist like George Pal.

I was privileged to sit at his table in 1975, Easter Sunday, for a celebrity breakfast. He was soft-spoken, jovial and kind to all us fans.

If you don't know of his Puppetoons or movies, get this, then seek out everything on DVD from Amazon. You could start with his 1952 WAR OF THE WORLDS or his classic 1960 THE TIME MACHINE; it still remains the unrivaled best version, though remade (badly!) a couple of times.

Glimpses of his triumphs like THE 7 FACES OF DR. LAO, THE CONQUEST OF SPACE, DESTINATION MOON, the aforementioned Puppetoon Series for Paramount and THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF THE BROTHERS GRIMM are all here. Interviews, behind-the-scenes specials, award ceremonies and special features make this a treasure trove for Science-Fiction and fantasy film fans.

I wish another like George would come along; we need the like of him now.",1384128000,,917,4.858974358974359

The documentary covers a lot of territory, and it""s wonderful to see clips from all these films!  As a kid in the 50s I grew up watching these movies, and along with the films of Ray Harryhausen, I just could not get enough of these films.  It's also being offered by Amazon at a great price!! If you don't already have films like the original War of the Worlds, The Time Machine, and the 7 Faces of Dr. Lao, no doubt you'll be tracking them down and adding them to your collection after watching this.  Absolutely recommended!",1377734400,,615,4.5636363636363635

8173172,5,630594444X,"""The Fantasy Film Worlds of George Pal"" (1985 - 93 minutes), written, produced and directed by Arnold Leibovit, is a spectacular documentary about the life and workmanship of the director George Pal. It presents some very cool testimonies of Rod Taylor, Ray Bradbury, Tony Curtis, Joe Dante, Barbara Eden, Ray Harryhausen, Roy Disney, Charlton Heston, Walter Lantz, Janeth Leigh, Tonny Randall, Gene Roddenberry and Robert Wise. Originally an architect, the Hungarian George Pal (1908-1980) is one of the best references of the fantastic cinema and the animation in stop-motion. Pal became famous in Europe for his advertising films using animation of dolls, technique named by him as ""Puppetoons"". The first one of them, in 1932, was a great success and showed cigarettes dancing. Running away from the Second World War, the director went to United States where he began to work to Paramount Pictures. He started making a series of short animations and soon he was producing and directing movies, always with his particular touch of fantasy and special effects. During five decades Pal produced and/or directed classics as ""War of the Worlds"", ""Seven Faces of Doctor Lao"", ""Destination Moon"", ""The Time Machine"", ""Conquest of Space"", ""When Worlds Collide"", ""Atlantis: The Lost Continent"",""Sinbad "",""Aladdin"" and ""The Wonderful Worlds of Brothers Grimm"". ""The Power""(1968) and ""Doc Savage""(1975) were his last productions. An indispensable documentary.
