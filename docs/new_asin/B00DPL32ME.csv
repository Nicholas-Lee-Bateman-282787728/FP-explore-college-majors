5841620,4,B00DPL32ME,"""Frozen Ground"" is a film based on the events leading up to the arrest of serial killer, Robert Hansen, who was convicted of killing four women, but is known to have killed over twenty.  Some of the best crime thrillers are those that keep the tension mounting and don't detract from the story.  ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Seven"" are still, to my mind, two of the best crime thrillers ever done.  ""Frozen Ground"" for the most part, fulfills these two requirements.  It is a solid entry of the genre that won't disappoint.

Cindy Paulson (played very well by Vanessa Hudgens) is a local prostitute who has just escaped certain death at the hands of Robert Hansen.  She is found trembling in a room by police.  However, Hansen appears to have a solid alibi for his whereabouts, and due to Paulson's questionable job and character, her story is not taken as credible by the D.A.  The irony is that Paulson is the only known person to have escaped from Hansen, and yet her story is, at least initially, not believed.

Enter Alaskan State Trooper, Jack Halcombe who is asked to investigate the matter.  Halcombe is based on Glenn Flothe, the actual  Alaskan State Trooper who had been investigating the discovery of several bodies of women dumped in the Alaskan wilderness.  At first, Halcombe is reluctant to investigate a case, that he feels, should be the responsibility of the local law enforcement.  However, the deeper he looks, the more convinced he becomes that Paulson is telling a credible story and that Hansen is the man responsible.

Robert Hansen is a man who appears to be anything but a serial killer (yes, we've heard the profile by many law enforcement officials about how serial killers don't have a particular look).  He runs a bakery and has a wife and two children.  He has many friends, and he is even acquainted with some of the people of the Anchorage Police Department, who mostly swear that Hansen is a stand-up citizen who can't possibly be the serial killer that Halcombe is looking for.

The strength of the film is in the journey, not the destination.  This isn't a film about who is doing the killing.  We all know.  It's about how Halcombe is able to finally present a solid case against Hansen.  The story takes place in the early 80s when the acquiring of forensic evidence isn't like what we see today.  Halcombe is also angry with the D.A. for not providing him with a warrant to search Hansen's property.  The D.A. argues that Halcombe has no evidence or basis for him to get a warrant.  Meanwhile, Paulson is still out there, and just how long can she survive?  Halcombe has to find evidence against Hansen and also find a way to protect Paulson, a known rebellious prostitute who is also a drug addict.

The strength of the film rests with its two principle actors: John Cusack and Nicholas Cage.  This is some of the best work I've seen in years from Cage.  It reminded me of how good he can be when he chooses smart roles to play.  Cusack, who is good in just about everything he does, is exceptional as Robert Hansen.  We get a brief glimpse into the mind of Hansen and what drove him to prey on all of these women.

An element that prevents this film from being even better is too much focus on Paulson.  We know that she is a key element for Halcombe, but too much time spent on her drug addiction and trying to get money by becoming a stripper takes away from the film rather than adding to it.  I would have rather had more time spent on Hansen.  His character is the most interesting.  Also 50 Cent(who plays Paulson's pimp) needs to keep away from acting.  It's not his forte at all.

All in all, you can't go wrong with this film.  If you like crime thrillers as much as I do, then this will be a welcome addition for you.",1377388800,7,3768,4.502949852507375
5841621,5,B00DPL32ME,"This film is based on the true story of a serial killer named Robert Hansen. The story is basically about how a cop works tirelessly to bring him to justice.

Lately, I have not been expecting Nicholas Cage films to be good.  In fact, I go in with very low expectations.  Seeing he was going to star in this movie with Vanessa Hudgens, that just lowered them even more.

Then I saw the film.  I was surprised that it was as good as it was.  It is less than an hour and fifty minutes, so the movie moves at a pretty decent pace.  Hudgens actually surprised me.  She did a pretty good job.  She was very convincing as a prostitute.

Cage's performance was not that different from other movies.  He has played a cop very often and did a very good job here.  What made this film work is mainly the chemistry between the actors.

John Cusack plays Robert Hansen.  That is not a spoiler by the way.  You know he is the one early on.  It is not a mystery genre film.  It is a true crime film.  I think he played Hensen well.  Hensen was known as a nerdy guy and I think Cusack captured that.

Overall, I give the film five stars.  I like true crime films and books.  If you do as well, this movie should keep you interested throughout your viewing.",1377302400,2,1241,4.169491525423729
5841622,3,B00DPL32ME,"I've read a book about this case -- ""Hunted on Ice"" -- a book that I didn't recommend, and left a review on this site as to why.  I also have seen a couple of documentaries as well, documentaries that made me initially interested in this case.  So I was really interested in seeing this film, particularly since John Cusack is one of the stars, and I've always been a big fan of his.  As I always say, if you disagree with me, just check out ""High Fidelity"" or ""Grosse Pointe Blank.""

But suffice it to say, after just watching today on pay-per-view, I am fairly disappointed in the final product.  In my opinion, they spent way too much film footage (or make that digital storage nowadays) in strip bars here (some people may say that as a plus, I suppose), and too much time dealing with the Cindy Paulson character.  Yes, she was an instrumental witness that ultimately helped convict Robert Hansen, as she was one of the only women he intended to kill who didn't die by his hands.  Or make that more by his gun.  I just don't feel that I really got to know or understand the Hansen character here much because the time that she spent on the screen was time lost for Mr. Cusack.

But still, if I were to stack rank the acting performances in this film, I would rank them as follows (best to worst):  Vanessa Hudgens, Nicholas Cage, and then finally Mr. Cusack.  But I'm not exactly sure that this was Mr. Cusack's fault; I'm not convinced that the screenplay gave him enough time on screen.  But at the same time, I think that he may have been slightly miscast as well; in reality, I believe that his talents were wasted on this surprisingly minimalist role.  And Mr. Hansen has a stutter in real life, and I think that that's always difficult for most actors to pull off on screen.

But perhaps the biggest disappointment for me:  I believe that they changed quite a bit of the true story for dramatic effect.  During the real search of the house, from what I remember, they found quite a few actual trophies from the victims.  Here, they seemed to allude that he buried them remotely under a fallen tree.  And there is a scene that shows the Hansen character paying someone to ""off"" Ms. Paulson.  Now, I can't believe that Mr. Hansen would ever pay anyone to kill anyone for him; he seemed to be pretty good at it himself.  And there is a subsequent scene where Ms. Hudgens almost dies by this paid assassin's hands and gets away.  (I may be wrong, but I don't think that any of this happened in the real case, from what I've read and seen.)

I've always said, ""When you've got a good story, just tell it.""  And I think that this unfortunately happened to a film that should have been incredibly riveting.  I'll give a minor recommendation to those familiar with the case; otherwise, I'll give an unfortunate pass.",1377216000,3,2819,4.439688715953308
5841623,4,B00DPL32ME,"Closely based on the real serial killer Robert Hansen this is not an action film but a suspence thriller. Thought provoking it tells the stroy very well and down to small details. Cage is unusual in the role of Jack Halcombe (a character based on the case's detective Glenn Flothe) as a tired detective that starts to puzzle the pieces together in a much larger puzzle than he suspects at the start. Many of the victims (but not all) were prostitutes that no one missed or really cared for. In the rare occasion that they did escape who would take their word against a respectable family man. Cusack's preformance as Robert Hansen is very good. Not the evil in flesh like Hannibal Lecter, he is very evil in his own right and you get to see his real evil behind the front he presents to the world and even a glimpse of terror his wife is forced to live with.

So don't buy this expecting an Cage action flick or Seven. But rather a well told story of real crime.",1376438400,173,962,4.344444444444444

We both like Nick Cage and were pleased to learn that he was the lead in this film - we had never heard of it before and despite always priding ourselves on keeping up with what is going on in the news, we had never heard or read about this serial murder spree or it's conclusion.  Nick Cage gives a great performance, as do the other actors but it was really good to see Nick in a film and role that is worthy of his talent!

There is quite a bit of the Hollywood wrapper around this story. Nevertheless it is well procedure. It tells the story. The viewer  is drawn into the story. Nicholas Cage does an excellent job acting. What harms the movie is resolving the crime that took place over years (perhaps 10) and being resolved in 105 minutes. There is no way to compress a timeline that much without compromising the story somewhat.",1530576000,,569,4.578431372549019

5841640,4,B00DPL32ME,"Cage is known for his over-the-top cheesy and/or action movies but I still watch and enjoy them. This, on the other hand, was not his typical movie. I think partially because it's based on a true story and the normal wackiness was reigned in. It reminded me that he really is a great actor. Also nice to see Vanessa Hudgens in a gritty role and getting away from her squeaky clean image. *spoiler* So glad that no-one came after his wife and kid. That's so redundant in so many movies.
That being said...my only 2 problems with this movie was that my mind was constantly trying to figure out the time period that it happened (maybe it was in the beginning and I missed it). The cars/clothes were 70's and 80's but they were talking about semen (testing wasn't used in court until 1986) and other samples and she had a cell phone (car phone) which really didn't start to become massively used until the late 80's (for the rich/city-bound) and early 90's. I couldn't imagine that they had reliable use in Alaska during that time (my friend lives in Juniper and still has a hard time getting a good signal)...especially driving the distance she did during a snow storm. I do like that they included FBI profiling because it really wasn't acknowledged as legitimate yet during those years. Overall...I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. I thought the images of the victims at the end was a kind acknowledgement by the producers. Well done.
A note to anyone interested: He died of natural causes in 2016. Rothschild, the assistant district attorney said ""He will not be missed, Good riddance to him. He's one of those kind of guys that you kind of hope every breath he takes in his life, there's some pain associated with it, because he caused such pain.""",1530489600,2,1745,4.632258064516129

Both can play just about any role and both proved it on this one. Nicholas Cage is a detective in Alaska following leads to a possible serial killer but his killing ground is in the mountains and wooded areas of Alaska so finding any connection to bodies, some never located is extremely hard.

All of the performances large and small were open and honest and true to living in those spaces and perspectives. I don't understand people and their dislike of Ms. Hudgen's portrayal of Cindy; because I thought she showed a woman who had lived through too much for too long and the result was her own sense of balance that couldn't quite keep her upright emotionally nor in spirit.  But was someone who desperately wanted to believe that there could be a better life ahead.  I have not seen her in other roles though I did recognize her. Maybe at the time people who followed her career felt it was a  forced choice and a departure - but even so she was incredibly adept at playing a vulnerable person who lived in and out of cause and effect. I was moved by the character's story.  I only know at the end of the movie it hit me like a pressurized wave of sorrow:  that this really happened to so many young women and how brutal and awful and terrifying it must have been, my heart just breaks for them all.

The good Nicholas Cage showed up this time and John Cusack is great as oddball family man/serial killer Robert Hansen. But Vanessa Hudgens, using the film to say ""I'm grown up now!,"" plays a hooker like she's in a high school play missing only the gum smacking and short skirt (the film takes place in Alaska). Part of the problem is the script which turns Hudgen's Cindy Paulson into a flighty, annoying plot device. At a certain point I was rooting for her to get taken out. Also, Hudgens seems to be the only nude dancer in the world who doesn't actually dance nude. Memories of Flashdance. The true story of Robert Hansen, the ""Butcher Baker,"" is actually more horrific than depicted in the film.",1527811200,,806,4.604166666666667

5841693,4,B00DPL32ME,"RELEASED IN 2013 and written & directed by Scott Walker, ""The Frozen Ground"" is a crime thriller based on the true story of Alaskan serial killer Robert Hansen, who raped, tortured and killed numerous young women from 1971-1983. Vanessa Hudgens plays a 17 year-old prostitute who successfully escaped from Hansen (John Cusack). Nicolas Cage plays the trooper who establishes a relationship with her as he zeroes-in on Hansen.

This has elements like Kiss the Girls (1997), The Flock (2007) and Hardcore (1979). If you like those crime thrillers, youll appreciate this one. The Anchorage locations are perpetually overcast, but breathtaking and foreboding. Cusack is notable as the average-looking killer and Cage is stalwart as usual. The events take place in 1983 when anchorage was booming due to the pipeline and the ensuing sex industry. The scenes depicting the sleazy underbelly of the city (at that time) are well done and convincing.

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 45 minutes and was shot entirely in Alaska.

It's not easy to make a great movie of a serial killer story (Silence of the Lambs is probably the only one I can think of off hand) and Frozen Ground tries and on a few levels succeeds - watch for the scene were Cusack, being interrogated, makes his jaw twitch from nervousness. There are the usual plot contrivances that defy belief - such as when Cusack's almost-victim, Hudgens, walks into the interrogation room, stares at him for a few moments, and he confesses all.... erm, yeah. In real life, Hansen confessed when presented with a map he'd made pinpointing his victims' bodies - but I guess that wasn't dramatic enough. Then there are the scenes between Cage and his wife, which read like a bad Lifetime TV movie. Still, not a bad effort. It goes to show you how difficult making a good film can be, and how only one or two substandard elements can throw the whole thing into the B-fare category....",1473292800,,1286,4.644736842105263

It's pretty gripping - well acted by Cage and Cusack, as well as the lead actress whom I had never seen before.  Part of its appeal, and its problem, is that it's based on real-life events.  I found it a lot more disturbing and depressing knowing that it really happened - not in a good way.  It also doesn't have some of the drama/surprise elements that it would probably have if it were being written as fiction.

This is just a note in passing this serial killer died in prison of a heart attack just last year.",1455667200,,557,3.9732142857142856

5841783,5,B00DPL32ME,"(Nicholas Cage as Jack Halcombe, John Cusack as Robert Hansen and Vanessa Hudgens as Cindy Paulson).

1983 State of Alaska, North America. State trooper Jack Halcombe tries to get a warrant for the arrest of Robert Hansen after listening to the terrifying escape of Cindy Paulson from a man who frequented a night club picking up girls then flying them to a hideaway in the mountains where he would let the women go, terrified she would run into the woods to escape - Robert Hansen would then shoot the victim with a deer hunting rifle. When Jack Halcombe interviewed Robert Hansen, Hansen said that the girls kept asking for more money then Hansen put it back to Jack Halcombe saying ""you know how it is"". Jack Halcombe found Robert Hansen's Ute with the rifles in the boot and incidentally the matching bullets of the .223 caliber rifle used to shoot the escaping women. The judge would not hear the case because the rifle did not mean Robert Hansen had fired the rifle. Jack Halcombe presented a bangle from Susan and said ""did you take the bangle off during or after interfering with Susan before killing her"", Hansen still did not break. 17 year old Cindy Paulson stood at the opened door with an officer. Robert Hansen shouted ""I should have killed you when I had the chance"", witnessed by four officers. Robert Hansen had marked on a hunting map 24 shooting locations. Of the 17 reported missing, 11 were found shot in the back. Robert Hansen was sentenced in the state of Alaska to 461 years and life. A DVD in tribute to the memory of the many women who had tried and failed to escape.

John Cusack was amazing - he had so much presence - I was really struck by how believable he was. I was really impressed with that. The scores were beautiful as was the cinematography.

5841803,4,B00DPL32ME,"The background of the film based on real events is set in the
seedy part of downtown 'Anchorage' 'Alaska'
Bodies of women are found, State Trooper 'Sgt Jack Halcombe see's
links to a number to a number of missing down then years, and
comes up with one name 'Robert Hansen' who had been questioned on
previous occasions.
Proving 'Hansen' to be the abductor and killer could rest on an
18-year old prostitute, 'Cindy' who had escaped captivity, but....
she's frightened.
A solid and often tense drama which will hold your attention throughout.
Unlike an earlier reviewer, I have been a bit of a fan of 'Nicolas Cage'
ever since watching him in movies such as 'Face/Off' 'Con-Air' and 'The
Rock' in this, he's superb as the investigating officer.
'John Cusack' plays a convincing role as the abductor'",1448150400,,798,4.8321167883211675

It is more a psychological thriller, with blood and gore kept to a minimum. The pace of the movie was good, allowing time for development of characters and suspense, but never so slow it got tiresome. I'm already a fan of Cusack, and his performance does not disappoint. I think Cage can be hit-and-miss, but he was very good in this role. I don't know much about Vanessa Hudgens' acting, but she did an amazing job playing a very troubled teenage prostitute/stripper here. The story is captivating (and horrifying)--especially since it was based on real events. This is definitely one of the better ""true crime"" movies I have seen.",1446854400,,777,4.557142857142857

The drama lies in whether the sergeant can gather enough evidence against him, and that turns on whether he can get the latest (near) victim to cooperate.  The victims are prostitutes, the killer a seemingly upstanding citizen with a family and a bakery business.  In the seedy underside of the city, only money means anything.

There are few directors who can get away with believable portrayals of street folks in many scenes. Then, there are the unnecessary ""graphic"" scenes. John Cusack was well cast in his role. Curtis 50 cent Jackson has a cameo in this movie. I am inclined to define ""The Frozen Ground"" as a ""Curtis 50 cent Jackson type film"". A wanna be film.",1445731200,,504,4.738636363636363

5841942,5,B00DPL32ME,"Wow! This was a fantastic movie! The acting was superb! The plot was nail biting! I literally caught myself nervously fidgeting on several occasions.

I never figured out why people who comment, explain what the movie is about, as that is already covered by the trailer and the descriptions by the movie thumbnail. So I won't go over it again.

I thoroughly enjoyed this movie because it had so many twists, so much mystery, and I found myself really caring for the victim. Movies like this one prove what top rate acting can accomplish. It is no wonder that it got over 4000 reviews and most above average.

I even got massive chills at the end because it hadn't registered in my brain that this movie is based on actual events. When they showed pictures of the actual victims, it only amplified the anger that I felt towards the aggressor, and I won't spoil the outcome for you.

If you are unsure about what movie to rent and you are up for a detective, mystery, nail biting story line, this one is definitely a safe bet. I'd been wanting to watch it for the longest time, but it was much more expensive to rent it, a few months back, now it is under $3.00. A no brainer if you ask me!",1445644800,7,1188,4.361990950226244

5842152,3,B00DPL32ME,"A good freebie, but I would have been disappointed if I had paid full retail to see the flick.  It seems as though the writer was more interested in cataloging the horrendous demise of the many women killed by the murderer than in the true entertainment of the show; the killer's mind.  I also found it interesting that despite profession the female star is playing, we never see her in less than a bra and panties.  I also need to slam the director.  I've watch a number of Cage flicks, and know he is capable of portraying characters that totally suck me into the movie for a quarter hour at a time.  Not here though.  In fact, none of the acting showed very much intensity.  The story just plods along, with momentary spikes in action.  There was so much more that could have been done to portray the terror of the victims, the psyche of the murderer, the psyche of the cop, the involvement of the community.  I would have included news play, or something that would have heighten the viewer's involvement in the story.  In my opinion, there might have been more drama in the courtroom of the real killer, as the terrible, and frightening murders were described, than the events that were portrayed on the screen.  Obviously, the director was more interested in respecting the memories of the victims, than presenting a cinematic story that would grab the viewer from the now, and place them in the danger, or in the emotion of the pursuit of the criminal.",1442361600,,1459,4.573076923076923

5842822,2,B00DPL32ME,Typically I'm a fan of Nick Cage and John Cusack in films and regardless of a rotten tomatoes review or what others think I'll go ahead and rent it hoping for something surprisingly good. Similar to the way a lot of Schwarzenegger fans felt about Maggie. Well unfortunately this movie was really not paced well and all to often I found myself wondering if I hadn't just been better off watching an SVU rerun for free. Neither character ever felt to me like they got in the role and at every suspenseful turn there was no suspense. I don't want to give away any spoilers but suffice to say how you think it will end in the beginning is how it ends in the end.

Told through the eyes of law enforcement, this story details the one girl that
escaped his grasp when Bob Hansen was loading gear (and her) into his plane
to fly north to kill her in the Alaskan wilderness. She was the one girl who brought
him down, and ended his decade long heinous murder career. I have never much
liked John Cusack, or cared for his acting or roles that he played/casting, but this

John Cusack gives a typically (for him) one-dimensional performance; it would have been nice to see more of his character with his family. Nicolas Cage does a little better. Vanessa Hudgens vacillates between cooperating with the cops and running back to her old life and the motivation isn't always clear. The scenes inside the strip clubs seem a trifle overdone, but maybe that's just me.

5842969,2,B00DPL32ME,"THE ONLY REASON THIS MOVIE IS RATED SO HIGH IS BECAUSE ITS BASED OFF A TRUE STORY. If it wasn't, no one would care and it would be considered a typical Nicholas Cage movie. The acting was fine but the script was terrible.

(Spoilers below)

A girl gets kidnapped but is intelligent enough to escape. Police investigate and know who the guy is. They have her testimony, other victims testimonies, and the murder weapons - yet the district attorney has to have a confession...? Then a police officer randomly presents a map with all the grave-sites...and they still MUST have him confess.

Then the ""intelligent"" girl who recently ran into the murderer...decides to flee from police protection. She gets snatched up by a bad guy, taken to a site to be killed...and luckily gets away. With a huge headstart, the bad guy somehow follows her in his car and instead of going to say a populated place (a diner, walmart, busy gas station, club, etc) she goes to the one place he can easily get to her. Just terrible.",1434153600,,1008,4.620111731843576

5842997,5,B00DPL32ME,I've been telling everyone about this sleeper since I watched it.  John Cusack is a great villian. Nicolas Cage plays the about-to-retire-but-gets-pulled-back-in detective but the real gem is Vanessa Hudgens.  She was the real reason I wanted to watch this movie because I know she wants to shed her Disney image and she does but with dignity and respect for the real surviving  victim. The grimy isolated Ankorage setting was effective and even 50 Cent was surprisingly convincing. You will feel for each one of these characters.,1433808000,,530,5.068965517241379

5843087,5,B00DPL32ME,"This was an excellent dramatization of the Robert Hansen serial killer case from Alaska. Hansen was portrayed very convincingly by John Cusack, and Nic Cage was great as Sgt Jack Halcombe of the Alaska State Trooper's office. The acting was very realistic to me; the sets and cinematography were great. There was nothing that pulled me out of the story to say Wait! that doesn't fit! which is always a frustrating feeling when you are watching a movie.
This was kind of an interesting take on the thriller genre, because you pretty much know from the opening scenes who the bad guy is. All along, you are rooting for the investigators and hoping they can catch a break so this guy is caught. Every time there's a setback the tension ratchets up because it is no longer a question of whodunit but will they get him? One thing that really caught my attention was the very unconcerned attitudes of the DA/cops when Cindy reports the rape/assault she experienced at Hanson's hands. There was definitely an attitude that she was just a pros and therefore it wasn't worth their time to even pick up the rape kit from the hospital. I think that's probably a large part of why Hansen got away with his crimes for so long - he chose invisible women to attack, rape, and murder. Had Cindy Paulson not escaped, he might have continued his string of murders until he was just physically no longer able to kill. Chilling thought.
The cars, clothing, etc. were so perfect. Ah the 1970s/80s, how I don't miss your style!
All in all I think this was a good movie. There were definitely moments of tension that moved the story forward, and even the slow moments didn't really make the movie drag on. In fact, the slow parts increased the realism of the fact that sometimes, investigations stall because there is just no other place to go until some situation changes.
The movie is rated ""R"" so you should know there's some ""bad"" stuff, besides the obvious story line. There are boobs everywhere in the strip club/dance club scenes. Also, thong panties just make your butt look weird. Just sayin.' The F-bomb was used so many times I couldn't even count it. There are gruesome scenes of torture and murder that are not bloody explicit but are jarring nonetheless. There is an attempted abduction/murder that is very intense. So obviously this is for adults only. It is a sobering story, too, because of the nature of the beast that is the serial killer. In one way it is satisfying to see them brought to justice, but it is in another way sad to see that some people are just wired wrong.
I hope you enjoy the movie if you decide to watch it.",1432857600,14,2624,4.573248407643312

Not stunned by any means, but this movie does deserve a decent amount more credit than I was suspecting.  This is a fairly well done dramatization of a real life story, with most actors involved doing a stand-up job.

Unfortunate in that it has a very capable cast. John Cusack had the makings of a creepy serial killer who lives among us - seemingly good citizen masking his dark side to family and co-workers. He doesn't get the opportunity to take it anywhere as scenes with family, friends and even victims are brief. Not enough to develop the horror lurking beneath his calm exterior. Similarly, half-hearted attempt at rendering the family conflicts that Nicholas Cage wrestles with while pursuing the case. Much is unexplained about the killer's history and current community status or how he can realistically pursue his criminal activities.

With all that said, if you like these two actors, there's enough there to sustain a lazy Sunday afternoon. If these actors don't entice you, don't waste your time.",1428364800,,933,5.098039215686274

I was drawn in by Nicolas Cages compulsion to find the killer portrayed by John Cusack.  John was a scary s.o.b. who makes you think that anyone you meet in your life could be this guy. The story is literally dark and depressing and each character continuously adds to an inescapable feeling of doom. There is no real happy ending unless you want to call surviving after being tortured and almost murdered a good thing.  These kind of memories never go away.  I cant imagine how a person gets over this life altering experience.

Not being a big Nick Cage fan, primarily because almost every one of his movies are him playing the same character again and again, in this movie he seems to find a different character to play and it shows.

5843702,4,B00DPL32ME,"Not for the faint of heart, and if you have teenage daughters I would pass. Otherwise an extraordinary acting performance by John Cusack as a serial killer makes it totally worth while.  What this film does very well is show the banality of evil as Nicholas Cage's cop doggedly tracks Cusack's sicko character. Cage plays it pretty deadpan, he is the tent-pole of the story and is solid all the way.

Alaska itself becomes a character in the story, nothing like that stupid Northern Exposure show, the tourism board is probably horrified at the portrayal of Alaska as land of whores and strip clubs surrounded by cavemen and wilderness and lazy turf-warring cops, where teenage girls bodies are only found when a bear digs them up. Not for the squeamish, but they don't over-linger on the yuck either, just enough to make the point.

A very good film, not sure what happened to it theatrically. You don't have to be a Cage fan. Not quite on the level of ""Joe"" but still worth your time.",1425859200,,986,4.622857142857143

Since it was based on a true story, there's not much I can say for the storyline. It was pretty straightforward with not a whole lot of surprises. The cops knew who the killer/rapist was so their MO was to get proof to take him in. What made the movie almost unbearable to watch, however, was the cinematography and bad editing. I know they were going for an ominous feel, but everything was way too dark. I adjusted my TV every way I could and still could barely see anything. It didn't help that all the girls had pitch black hair and the guys wore black and all the citizens wore black. Against a dark, dim background (in Alaska winter, when it's hardly daylight anyway), it was very difficult to distinguish one character from another.  The sound was awful too.

He is so miscast in this film, even though he does a good job; It is hard to wrap your head around beloved John acting in such a frightening way.

The story, because it is a true account of a serial killer, is very disturbing. This is a dark film, which tells the account of very horrible murders that took place in Alaska over a long period of time.  There are no scenes of grieving parents, or any exploitation of families. The film deals with the police work involved in apprehending the killer. The Justice that is delivered, cannot erase the reality of all who died because of this madman.

5843836,4,B00DPL32ME,"I rented this one not really knowing what it was about - and I think I'll probably spend the rest of the night a little nauseated. It's hard to imagine that evil like this can exist in the world. I was definitely shocked by this movie. That said, I did think it was really well done.

I picked this up because I LOVE John Cusack and because I lived in Alaska for two years. Guess I should have read the back cover a little more carefully, lol! The Frozen Ground is basically a suspense thriller about the horrific actions of a prolific serial killer and an Alaska Trooper's determination to stop him. There's a lot of nudity, quite a few f-bombs, and many shockingly violent scenes involving women being tortured and murdered. Thankfully none of the rape scenes were actually shown.

Usually I can't stomach movies like this, but this film did a really nice job of portraying the violence without glorifying it. I may have picked it up by accident, but I was drawn in by the suspense. It was heart-wrenching to learn what these women went through, but I thought the producers and actors told the story in an extremely respectful way. Obviously a movie about a serial killer is going to have disturbing scenes, but it was done in such a way that I felt like I was being shown what happened so that I would UNDERSTAND, not so that I would be entertained - if that makes sense.

My only complaint is that Cusack was cast as the serial killer. Don't get me wrong - he was very convincing. And I can understand why he was cast - this monster was *that* guy - the one who leads the double life. You hear stories about serial killers who are upstanding members of their community - little league coaches and such - and when they're caught no-one can believe it because they seemed so nice and normal. Who better to portray that then someone like Cusack? It was just hard for ME, personally, to watch a favorite, lovable actor portray someone so horrific.

Definitely worth watching, but not buying. It's well done, well acted, and very suspenseful - but I couldn't endure watching this kind of violence a second time. I think I've checked the locks on my doors three times already tonight, and I'm pretty sure I'm going to have nightmares.

**MINOR SPOILER** - the most shocking part of this entire movie (for me) was during the end credits. I just sat there, watching those faces flash by...completely stunned. Nothing could have made a bigger impact than that. I can't even wrap my brain around such pure evil existing in this world. May those women rest in peace.",1424476800,,2559,4.53030303030303

I recognized other actors I like and respect from other recent movies and TV shows. Does not overdo the violence or disturbing images, but keeps the suspense growing as it moves to a very satisfying conclusion. I never had heard of this Alaskan serial killer, but I checked Wikipedia and the movie gets it true-to-life. a VERY impressive effort by the writer/director Scott Walker, whose name I remember because I have a friend with the same name.

People find people all over Alaska without any hint (or at least no hint ever disclosed to the viewer). Cage's character interviews the only living witness a couple of times (seems to find her wherever she is) without ever asking about what the guy looks like. Then Cage's character interviews Cusacks's character, they talk like forever about what not, instead of letting the witness id him. Really....?

On the tech side: Shaky bwp-like picture, unwatchable on anything larger than a mobile phone. A cut every 2 seconds. Gives you a headache and is a waste of time. Cusack and Cage both stopped making good movies around 2000, period.",1420329600,,748,4.984

5844130,5,B00DPL32ME,"The Frozen Ground is a thriller based on the real-life hunt for serial killer Robert Hansen at Alaska during the 1980's. It was reported that the said serial killer has stalked and murdered between seventeen to twenty- one young women. Apparently,he would kidnap them and take them out to the wilderness where he shot and buried them. It stars Nicolas Cage as Sgt. Jack Halcombe,which was based on the character of Alaskan detective that captured the killer,Glenn Flothe; and John Cusack as Hansen himself.

This is a well-paced and engaging film feature. Despite the fact that the movie is something that we have already seen before in other thrillers and that it is far from being refreshing and original,we get to see great performances from both Cage and Cusack. It is also worth mentioning that it is a solid film and it will definitely provide a lot of thrills and entertainment to the viewer especially during Halcombe's investigation of the murders. But inspite of it,it falls short as there were a lot of plot holes like a character analysis of Hansen on his motive of committing those crimes as well as the other victims apart from Paulson. Too bad that it could have been better since this is obviously made as a lasting tribute to the victims of Hansen.",1419206400,,1265,4.776255707762557

Not sure if the town was filmed in the real Anchorage, but the airplane scenes and snowy mountain vistas were impressive, if but to convey that out here, if you're in trouble, ain't no one gonna find out, which unfortunately resonated throughout the film.

5844197,4,B00DPL32ME,"I don't typically give a movie 5 stars unless it is one that I would want to watch over and over.  This one to me was almost good enough to get 5 stars except I would not want to watch it over and over.  I felt like the acting in the movie was very good for all 3 of the main characters.  I also was drawn into each of them and was trying to imagine what their lives would be like.  The back and forth between the state trooper (Nicholas Cage) and the victim that got away and was the key to his case (Vanessa Hudgens) seemed very realistic.  The fact that it was based on a true story was even more interesting.

I would have liked a bit more insight into the family life of the Serial Killer (John Cusack).  They did show many examples of how he seemed to be a respected member of the community and they showed one scene that might have indicated that it was not all roses, but it would have been interesting to see more.  People like that generally have a dark side that you can see more easily from those really close to them.  I felt John Cusack did a fantastic job with the character.

A movie like this makes me want to get into law enforcement to help find and prosecute evil people such as the killer in this movie.  It makes me wonder how many others are out there doing these despicable things for many years without anyone knowing.  I truly feel sorry for all of his victims and their families.  I hope his capture and prosecution was able to bring them some closure and they are able to move on.  These killers are just the scum of the earth with no regard for anyone but themselves.  It is hard to imagine how someone could be so callous and uncaring.  To put someone through hell like that only to kill them for sport when he tired of them is unfathomable to me.  Just think of all of the people's lives that were impacted negatively by just this one person.  I said some prayers for all the families of his victims after watching this movie since I imagine coping with this happening to your daughter, sister, niece, friend, etc would be difficult.

I highly recommend watching this movie.",1418428800,,2105,4.2569269521410575

5844267,5,B00DPL32ME,"For those who have the ability to face reality, this is an awesome movie. Everyone acted perfectly, the pace of the movie made it easier to take it, and makes one think about the society at large. It reminds me of Seven sins and how we are either running from reality or simply turning our face from it. The scene where Nicolas Cage's wife gets Cindy out of the house was shocking but cruelly true.",1417392000,,398,4.32
5844268,4,B00DPL32ME,Very disturbing story about an even more disturbing man. There is a scene in which a young lady is shot while running in the woods. The film-makers did an amazingly accurate job of capturing the look on a human's face as their life ebbs away. I have worked in the ICU setting for nearly 30 years and have witnessed that same look as patients lose their fight for life. I would have given the movie 5 stars if it weren't for the gratuitous nudity and language.,1417392000,,459,4.348837209302325

5844314,4,B00DPL32ME,Very intense!!  It was a race to catch a killer before he struck again.  Cage and Cussack did a great job in portraying the detective and the serial killer.  If you watch this movie be ready to be sit on the edge of your seat!!,1416787200,,227,4.0

5844328,5,B00DPL32ME,"For those that live in their little white houses with the little white picket fence that keep reality at bay, this movie is not for you.  The gritty side of reality has not changed (1960's, 1970's, 1980's, 1990's, 2000's, 2010's) because humans have not changed.  These types of people still exist (Green River Killer-Gary Ridgeway, Hillside Strangler, Ted Bundy, BTK, Robert Yates, to name just a few).  If you were to google serial killers you will get some idea of what I am talking about.  The movie is reasonably accurate in portraying the underbelly of society in Alaska (Anchorage) at the time.  That's the thing about serial killers, they don't stand out.  Just think about the ones that have not yet been found out because they have not yet made a mistake that brings to light their activities.  A good, gritty movie.",1416700800,,826,4.774647887323944
5844329,2,B00DPL32ME,"Too voyeuristic for me. I prefer more character development. It would have been interesting to learn more about  Robert Hansen
(Cusack's character), not just the how but the why. How many people remained silent for him to get away with it for so long? This movie didn't delve into any of this instead just kept taking the viewer back into a strip club.  Expecting you to take everything at face value. Mediocre at best.",1416614400,,419,4.648648648648648

Fur Rendezvous.  2) Movie essentially ended before there was a confession.  Could that not have been included.?

5844508,4,B00DPL32ME,"I'm ""not"" thinking that this is one of Cage's better movies.  It wasn't rated for the typical United States puritan type-of-audience since there was no 'R' rating for boobies and other body parts (nudity).  So if body parts offend you, then this is probably not the movie to be watching.  The nudity actually did not seem to have any worthwhile part for what I thought was the actual plot.

I would not watch this movie again.  Infact, while it was playing, I managed to be more interested in doing some other things so I could avoid having to look at it.

I think the mystery plot had a good roll to it keeping my partner's attention.  For me, it was the same old stuff.

So it got four stars because my partner liked it and stayed awake!",1413072000,,739,4.343065693430657

5844512,2,B00DPL32ME,I have always been a fan of Nicolas Cage but for quite awhile now he just churns out junk movies. He doesn't seem to put any effort into his part. I think they call it sleepwalking. I put off watching this movie for awhile dreading it would be bad and it was. John cusack is the only one in the movie that really acted. The girl who played the young prostitue was not good. It only came alive when Cusack was onscreen. I think Cage needs to change course and only play the bad guy or psycho roles to breathe some life into his career. He still looks great and seems in good shape. I think action roles where he is the sarcastic bad guy soot him best. The only parts or lines from this movie I remember are Cuzacks nothing from Cage. Some actors are not good as  the lead actor but are better as supporting or character actors. I think Cage falls in this group.,1413072000,,860,4.149700598802395

Lots and lots of beautiful scenery of this beautiful state, as well as the local Anchorage area.

The director told this story in a manner that minimized the focus on the violence that was inherent in this true story and made it more of a character study of the protagonist and antagonist.  So, I believe it deserves five out of five rather than four.

Both Nicolas Cage and John Cusack are talented actors who can play a wide range of characters and this movie highlighted their skills.

Based on true events, which my mother varied were true based on the fact she's a true crime book reader and had previously read about this story in one of Ann Rule's books. Vanessa Hudgens was amazing, she's come along way since High School Musical days and Nicolas Cage acting is best served for serious roles like this.  He pulled of his character convincingly well.

5844620,4,B00DPL32ME,"While the movie was done well as a thriller and the ""villain"" was perfectly portrayed, the excessive ""adult language"" makes it impossible for me to recommend to anyone I care about. It's puzzling to me that Hollywood insists that this kind of dialog is the best way to reach adult audiences. It's also a good ""work-around"" for those in the industry who can't accurately portray anger in their character. ""Throwing F-bombs at high volume means he's mad,"" seems to be all the direction some people need. Even if, occasionally, the profanity was justified, the pervasive use of it degrades rather than enhances the quality of the film.

Please don't think this is language I've never heard outside of a film. I have worked with the military since 1971. I have no ""virgin ears."" I'd just rather not have it as part of my entertainment.",1411344000,,831,4.770833333333333

The historical background of the movie was extremely sad and left me feeling uneasy.

This picture is slow and tedious because we know all that we need to know from the very beginning but we are forced to wait almost 2 hours for it to happen. If you enjoy films where you get to follow the lives of three individuals until a conclusion is reached. Then this is a film for you. Nicolas gives an impassioned performance and Cusack makes you believe that he believes everything that he says. I guess if you enjoy watching the investigative parts of police work, observing the addicts and mentally ill at work, then you may want to see this film.

I was only familiar with John Cusak in comedies, but this movie proved he's a very capable actor.  I so very much recommend this movie, but be warned.  It is not a family friendly viewing movie.

I could have used a little more back story of the killer himself and his normal, non-descript life that prevented police from pinning anything on him for a long time.

I love movies based on real characters and happenings, and thiis serial killer is an intriguing, especially sadistic one. I watched the movie the day the real killer died in prison at age 75. It was an uninspired treatment of the real-life situation. Nicholas Cage was Nicholas Cage, as always, and fun, as his acting style is, but he didn't bring anything to his part. However, John Cusack was outstanding as the killer. He looked like pictures of the actual killer, and lost himself in the role and gave a very real portrayal of the real killer...I wasn't reminded that he was John Cusack during the movie.

Than it came up free on Prime, yes Technically I paid for it in the long with my membership, but let's not nit pick here. It was free and free is for me.

 I was surprised by this film it was based on true events and it was scarey, not in a horror sense, but that people like that actually live among us. Cage was good in his portrayal of the Officer, he had passion and empathy into the character, Cusack nailed it as the killer, he did not have many lines but he brought the creepy to the 11th degree and it made the hair on my neck stand up.

5844885,5,B00DPL32ME,"I watched this movie last night and I loved how it was done. My husband and I were stationed there at the time this was going on. People were talking about this everywhere. I was just barely 18 years old at the time and I remember the military wives who were in their mid twenties asking why call girls and dancers were the victims. The first thought in my mind was ""no one cares about them and no one is going to miss them."" Being young, I spoke those words out loud in a quiet tone. Nicolas Cage and John Cusack did an amazing job in their portrayal of their roles. I have to say that John Cusack did an amazing job at playing a serial killer. I was so impressed by his skills as an actor and I am an even bigger fan of his skill because of this movie. When Nicolas Cage first came out I was not impressed by him but as the years went by I have become a fan of this amazing actor. The man is a talented actor and I love that I don't need closed captions to understand the words coming out of his mouth. It doesn't matter what accent he uses but I can clearly hear the words he speaks. The scenes in the movie that showcase Alaska is real. It may have been a long time since I have been in Anchorage but one never does forget the beauty of the state of Alaska. I do believe that if my memory serves me correctly that that may have been the actual Police Station when we were there 30 something years ago. Be prepared to be blown away and impressed with the quality of the script, acting skills, how the film was shot and by the amazing skill of John's portrayal of how a serial killer should be done.",1408320000,3,1601,4.053627760252366

I definitely remember when the actual case ""broke open"" as I was an Investigator on the Anchorage Police Department at the time (now retired APD), though not involved in this case. I had worked on Alaska State Troopers before joining APD so I personally knew (and still do)  several of the officers depicted in the movie from both the Anchorage Police and Troopers. Real life investigations are never as exciting as they are on the screen, so I will say that I certainly enjoyed the movie and would recommend it to crime buffs. For me, it was especially fun to see some of the Anchorage sights on screen; the downstairs bar scene had to be representing the old well known sleazy  Elbow Room which often required Police attention in those days. Both Cage and Cuzak kept the dark mood of the film moving and entertaining, though occasionally, the soundtrack got in the way of the dialogue of the characters.

all my windows despite the high heat and humidity. I did not sleep easy
after watching this true life drama. I imagine a lot of gore was
eliminated for the squeamish viewer aka moi, and tried not to watch
anything that provoked complete horror and disgust.

I had lost all interest in Nicolas Cage due to his more recent
lackluster roles but this effort revived his many talents. His
performance was top notch with sincerity, temerity and sentiment.
Excellent vehicle for a comeback Nic!

The views of the Alaskan outback, which primarily entails the entire
state, were stunning and almost inviting if it were not for the crime
scenes sprayed throughout. I could not fathom being a street prostitute
in 0d freezing snow. There were a few scenes that appeared to be too
coincidental but were few and far between.

I applaud the real Halcombe for pursuing this complex case and
delivering a modicum of justice. This aspect of society is typically
relegated to smirk filled TV shorts that do not capture the intense
fear and terror many feel in a big city let alone a remote part of the
world.

stay away from the pole and nightlife in general, the police are easily

He appears so normal on the surface, but then seething on the inside.

5845026,4,B00DPL32ME,"A prostitute escapes from a customer she says raped and tried to kill her. The detectives called in to investigate brush aside both her accusation and her story because of who she is. They don't even collect the rape kit for evidence. The patrolman who brought her in believes her, however, and mails copies of all the available reports to the Alaska State Troopers, and Jack Halcombe, who is two weeks away from transferring out, is assigned the case. In short order, Halcombe connects this one to several others occurring in the same area over years and since they now have a survivor, he's certain they can bring the man suspected in those cases to justice. It's a long and frustrating task, however, blocked by the girl's reluctance to testify due to the initial reception of her story, the killer's self-confidence he can't be touched, and the prosecutor's demand for enough evidence the case won't be thrown out of court.

This is a rather leisurely-paced film with very little in the way of blood and gore or any of the usual serial killer movies.  More attention is paid to Halcombe, the witness Cindy, and the investigation than in the killer himself or his actual motives.  Nicolas Cage is his usual driven self, Victoria Hudgens projects a tough girl/vulnerable waif-like quality as Cindy, and John Cusak still manages to look nerdy enough, even at his age, to appear harmless while being internally a vicious cold-blooded murderer.

The Alaskan landscape in winter provides a beautiful, cold, and frightening backdrop for this drama, showing how vast an area the troopers had to cover, and how easy it would be to lose a body, evidence, or even one's-self in the trees, mountains, and snow in an area better accessible by plane rather than car or on foot.  The story may not be as tense or gritty as some but it plainly points out, unfortunately, that even our remote 49th state isn't immune to the ills the rest of the nation suffers, and killers can exist even in such a beautiful place.

The posting of photographs of the real victims behind the end credits, and noting whether or not their bodies were ever recovered and/or identified (and it's noted several are marked as ""not known if identified"") is a chilling addendum to the story, as well as the fact that a good many of the victims were never found and it's believed there were many, many more than the killer admitted to.",1407110400,,2395,4.7314148681055155

Since part of the reality was some passing nude background, you can determine if that is a concern, but not primary and not made appealing.

Presents a nice presentation of a highly intelligent criminal, and the law officers he battles with. They are shown as finite. Experience and sweat matter, and an example of what real world law officers should be--but like every profession at times are not.

Actor N. Cage, the criminal and the primary victim are exceptional in this work, and it moves it from a documentary to a very well done drama.  Thank you for this gift.",1405900800,,729,4.76984126984127

really awful boring movie.
I was 40 minutes in & nothing had happened yet. & it's a LOOONG movie

there's barely any Nicolas Cage.
he's was ok in this.

John Cusack gets more screen time than Cage. He's pretty bad too.

Vanessa Hudgens should've been on the cover since she gets WAYYY too much screen time.
and her acting is soooooooo bad.

50 cent is in this for no reason. with a Cleopatra hairdo.
some fat guy was in this, idk his name but he was the best part of this movie because of one scene where he has ultra speed.

very messy movie. it's all over the place.

if you're expecting a Con Air or 8mm or Adaptation type movie, Nicolas Cage FORGET ABOUT IT
this is just Nic Cage paying some bills by being in this awful flick",1405468800,2,780,4.22972972972973

5845240,4,B00DPL32ME,We had no idea when we ordered this movie that it was based on real events. There is a lot of drama and the violent scenes are almost non-existent. There is some upper women's nudity when the characters are in a strip bar. This movie does an awesome job at depicting the hurdles police face while conducting an investigation (most notably when a prosecutor does not have the guts to do what needs to be done to stop a serial killer).

5845260,5,B00DPL32ME,"This outstanding movie tells the frightening, true story of convicted serial killer Robert Hansen, who raped and murdered several young women in Alaska between 1971 and 1983.  Nicholas Cage is intense as Alaska State Trooper homicide detective Jack Halcombe - based on real-life detective Glenn Flothe - determined to capture psycho killer Hansen, who is brilliantly portrayed by John Cusack: very low-key and good-natured on the surface, but displaying a cold, frightening brutality towards the women he sexually assaulted and murdered.  Hansen led a double life, a real Jekyll and Hyde: on the surface, he was the successful owner of a bakery, very quiet, very religious, a married man with two children.  His inner, dark world seethed with perverted, evil, and murderous misogyny, bubbling and oozing to the surface as he preyed on young women in the seamy, tough areas of Anchorage; many - although not all - of his victims were prostitutes and strippers. An avid hunter, he tracked and killed these young women just as he did the animals whose heads were nailed to the walls of his home. The lovely and very talented Vanessa Hudgens was perfect, just spot-on, as Hansen's real-life victim, Cindy Paulson - a tough-talking yet extremely vulnerable young street waif turned hooker, who was the only one who lived to tell.  It was her testimony in court which helped to convict Robert Hansen, who was sentenced to 461 years plus life in prison without parole; he will never be freed.  This powerful, intense, harrowing, and rather violent movie is not for the squeamish; however, it is exceptionally well-made and definitely worth watching.  *ETA on 08/24/2014: Hansen just died 10 days ago, on 08/14/2014, due to ""undisclosed, lingering health conditions"".  One less serial killer to torment innocent people.",1405296000,,1811,5.139455782312925

The plot was linear and predictable.  There were no surprises, no unforeseen twists.  The characters were two-dimensional, uninspiring, evoking neither sympathy nor antipathy.

I was mostly a fan of the film until the end when the prostitute makes a call from a car on a cell phone. The film takes place in the early 80s.

5845323,4,B00DPL32ME,"The Frozen Ground is based on the true story of serial killer Robert Hansen, who terrorized Alaska during  80s, during which time there were many reports of missing women as well as mysterious deaths in  Alaskan wilderness. In the film, a state trooper (Nicholas Cage) comes to believe that the string of deaths and missing person reports all come from one source, a respectable member of the community. Cindy Paulson, a teenager who had managed to escape Hansen, becomes a key witness in this case.

What I liked about The Frozen Ground is that, while the film does have elements of a crime thriller we've seen before, it has solid acting from several of the leads that make it go beyond an average thriller. Cage does an exceptional job of handling this role with a scaled-down, subtle realness. He tries to bring this cold-case back to life, and pin down enough evidence on the suspect to get a case. As real life Jack Halcombe, he tries to help Cindy get over the emotional trauma of her horrifying encounter all the while trying to track a madman. John Cusack plays the creepy role of Hansen to perfection. Vanessa Hudgens gives a stellar performance as Cindy.

I saw an interview with Nicolas Cage where he was talking about this film and preparing for the role. In it, he was discussing how he met with the real-life detective who was responsible for bringing Hansen to justice, and considered him a hero for his efforts. He got much of the background for this story and a feel for the person he was portraying. This is quite evident in the film. A really good performance.

This film, as expected, does have some disturbing content based on its subject. We are taken through the world of strip clubs and prostitution and the seedy parts of the community. There are also moments of violence that are disturbing.  I think these moments, though, give a stark realness to the setting and events that took place.

A powerful thriller. One to definitely check out.",1404864000,,1966,4.681159420289855

5845329,4,B00DPL32ME,"This was a surprisingly well paced and intrigueing movie based on a true story.
It is quite disturbing so those with delicate sensibilities should be warned.
The premise is that a young girl escapes from a situation where she was held captive by someone who allegedly took multiple other girls who did not escape. The rest of the story unfolds during the film so I will not say more than that about the plot.
Nick Cage is Nick Cage as the relentless cop on the hunt for the perpetrator.
John Cusack delivers a good creepy performance as the accused.
Vanessa Hudgens is a runaway who has taken to prostitution and stripping, leading to her abduction.
Ultimately the film made me disturbed that this type of thing actually happens in the world, but I guess that means that the movie was successful in telling the story.",1404864000,,817,4.641379310344828

I would recommend this to anyone interested in true crime.  Nicolas Cage does an excellent job portraying the detective.  These events took place in Alaska in a rather remote area, but then Alaska is filled with many remote areas.

I had a hard time figuring out ""who the actress was"" at first - that's how good her work is in this movie. Nicolas Cage looks a bit younger than he has in the last few movies I've watched of his, PLUS the movie really does have a 1980's vintage look (because that is the era these events transpired) ...So for a little while I though I had somehow rented an older movie.

It is a good movie, very well made with solid acting performances throughout. I took away 1 star because the movie gets a little bit bogged down using strip clubs and substance abuse as a way to add intensity and drama, whereas I have seen enough scenes like those in movies that it isn't particularly pulse elevating to watch. (Spring Breakers & The Bling Ring also heavily rely on ""the bad element"" of nightclubs & drug use to show the viewers ""how bad these people are..."" and it's almost laughable in this day and age) So this movie lost a star for not finding a more original way to add intensity to the story.",1404172800,3,1094,4.389162561576355

Cage and Cusack are playing serious dramatic roles, they are doing it in all seriousness and there is nothing short of reality in the way this is done.

5845521,5,B00DPL32ME,Great movie. It had me gripped from start to finish. This movie has a lots of twist and turn that will have you thinking and keep you at the edge of your seat.  Nicolas Cage does it again!,1403568000,,188,3.9473684210526314
5845522,3,B00DPL32ME,The film was interesting from the historical accuracy point of view. It lacked depth of character of the predator which would have made the character more than just a serial killer.,1403568000,,181,4.870967741935484
5845523,4,B00DPL32ME,Nicholas Cage is chasing a suspected serial killer while trying to find evidence and build a case. Good acting and pacing.

5845527,3,B00DPL32ME,...Teamed up to make a movie that was only OK as far as I am concerned.  My main problem was with Cusacks portrayal of the serial killer. Cusack may have been brilliant but the character he was playing was so sick that it was revolting to me to watch the actions and emotions of Cusack as he played his part. I have watched other true crime movies that were much more violent and messy but somehow this was an attack on the senses I did not like. Cage seemed a bit weak for the part.,1403481600,,483,4.08421052631579

5845538,4,B00DPL32ME,"Based on a true story, the fact that these women and their families suffered and continue to struggle knowing how their loved ones were murdered is horrific.  It's sad that this movie had to be made at all but to raise awareness of missing women that had been written off by society,  they should never be forgotten and we all should keep our awareness honed.",1403395200,,359,4.507692307692308

The problem with the film is that the case should have been solved in 5 minutes - simply by having the one survivor, Cindy, ID Hansen. Neither the Anchorage PD nor the Alaska State Police did so - until the very end.

There was also an obvious overtone of prosecutors and detectives being extremely overly deferential to suspect Hansen, but never any explanation of why - especially given that he had been convicted of several somewhat similar crimes.",1403222400,,659,4.927927927927928

Little things like the number of people on the street in Anchorage at night (I've never seen it that busy) to the time the ""bad"" guy takes off in his airplane from Merril Field in the middle of a snow storm without clearance from ground control or the tower.  Just so many things wrong.  I could go on and on....... just sayin'",1402963200,,403,4.207792207792208

When John Cusack's facial muscles started to twitch I thought I'd start twitching myself. The suspense builds so gradually that you suddenly realize your hands are in fists. Whether you know the story or not, you are so afraid for Cindy. I just wanted to hold her still until she saw reason, but her behavior was absolutely true to how she would feel - convinced that no one would really do anything to save her.

If I wanted a monitor full of boobs and bottoms, I would go to a porn site.  If I want a movie where the good guy has to recognize quality in someone of a different culture, I look for Nicolas Cage.  But not so in this movie.  This is porn and nothing more.

The director does an excellent job to bring you into the reality and fear of the women that where victims and his total evil brutality.  This is a good movie and lesson that there is evil in this life and we must be ready to defend our self, our family, and young women.  For this reason alone I believe Frozen Ground should be seen to see how fragile life is between good and evil.",1402704000,,559,4.10091743119266
5845627,2,B00DPL32ME,"I realize that this movie is based on a true story, but I found the story a bit tiresome.  Then, at the end, because it was based on a true story, I felt like they missed an opportunity to connect with the audience.  On a lesser note, it seemed like there were a couple unnecessary jabs at Christians.

It was tiresome because the heroine took so long to figure out that the police were trying to help her and that she wasn't safe on her own.  That's actually realistic but--I admit--I have little patience for people who refuse to be helped.  Unfortunately, Cage had no other option but to ""partner with [the] near victim and the only witness to escape the clutches of the serial killer in order to bring the murderer to justice.""  I'm not sure how, but the director should have captured her apprehensions in a less agonizing way.

I watched to the end because the murderer was one step ahead of them through the entire movie and I had to know if he would be brought to justice.  You'll have to watch the movie to find out for yourself.  In that respect, it was a compelling story.

At the end, the closing credits reminded us that the movie was based on a true story and showed photos of the victims.  I can say without spoiling the movie that the heroine was a prostitute and that much of the movie centered around sex trafficking and prostitution.  After the victim photos would have been an excellent opportunity for a public service announcement of some sort.  There could have been a plea to parents who need help talking to their children, to children considering turning to the streets, to victims who are afraid to speak out, or even to people who suspect that a loved one is acting strangely (a ""see something, say something"" plea).  There was none of that, though.  So, after watching this brutal movie about victims, I felt hollow because there was no call to action and no outlet for any of the emotion that the movie stirred up.",1402704000,,1943,4.480113636363637

5845649,4,B00DPL32ME,"These events really happened. They are captured in a more or less linear fashion in this movie that is set in Alaska. I liked the movie *most* because it's almost a documentary of the events that occurred -- and I love documentaries. It helps to have Cage and Cusack as the lead actors. Another reason that I liked the movie was that I've just returned from Alaska and co-incidentally visited a couple of these very places. The names and places resonated with me.

The sets and the acting is quite understated. I like that too. Watch this movie if you want to see a psycho-thriller.",1402531200,,582,4.542857142857143

5845651,5,B00DPL32ME,"I have always been a fan of John Cusack and Nicolas Cage. It has been awhile since they've ""starred"" in anything worthy, having said that, I find this movie surprisingly good. It stayed true to the actual ""story"" and they played their roles convincingly. John Cusack as Hansen was down right creepy. To see him play a different kind of role was refreshing, creepy but refreshing nonetheless. Nic Cage's acting was fitting in my opinion. I have not seen him commit to a character like this since ""Face Off."" Vanessa Hudgens aka Ms. High School Musical was much better than I expected. I remember seeing a couple of other films she played in which left me feeling ""meh."" This however shows that she actually has ability to not only act but to act well; which is very promising. The extras playing victims, side story and supporting law enforment characters help round out the film. The only ""um okay"" moment was seeing Mr. 50 Cent in his 70s-ish outfit. Not used to seeing that; at all.

Alaska is such a beautiful place and its serenity is can be downright scary at times. The setting and scenery are reminiscent of the time period and it creates a picture of how and what it was like to be there as things unfolded.

Overall, a very engaging movie not in a sense on ""who did it"" but more along the lines of ""this is what happened and this is how it went down."" As for the other reviews, everyone has their own opinions and my opinion concludes that this is a very good film with very convincing acting. Cheers.",1402531200,4,1510,4.487272727272727

It could have been a great movie, but the movie that was produced, was at best, just a so ...so film.  Although the movie told the story, I wanted to see or know more??
- How he committed the crimes?
- how he got away with it (his connections in the police department/ government/ paroled inmates) ?
- How the 1 victim actually got away?
-The detective's motivations etc...

5845713,5,B00DPL32ME,"This is not a movie for everyone, though it would be great if everyone saw it. It's not exactly entertaining, but it is riveting. Well produced, well put together, well directed, well written, and well acted, the fact that it is based on true events, and that they are allowed to unfold without excessive Hollywood adjustments makes it a kind of honorable memorial to the dozens of victims revealed to us in closing credits. It is also a very, very good film.

Nick Cage and John Cusack turn in solid, credible performances and are to be commended for setting their dials to ""Real"", leaving the equally real but more important job for Vanessa Hudgens. Yes, High School Musical songbird Vanessa Hudgens.  Here she is a 17 year old kid, a runaway, a prostitute, a victim of Cusack's methodical character, and a survivor who is quick in the one moment that keeps her alive but too young and disorganized to think ahead to what might keep her safe after escaping from the first of two encounters.

I have given away nothing. The sense of dread that I felt watching this movie came not from movie manipulation but very naturally from watching a vulnerable young girl who was brutalized first by her own family, then by her choices and then as well by a genuine monster and an overburdened, unresponsive system of law enforcement. None of this is just thrown in. It all comes out slowly and effectively.

Vanessa Hudgens and all who put her character front and center in this story deserve high marks.

Even an honorable memorial cannot bring any of the victims back, but it does do some justice in showing us how easily such things happen. That's worth something out here in the real world.",1402185600,6,1685,4.65993265993266

Show was also effective in establishing developing horror of crimes committed and mounting frustration of investigator in trying to nail the murderer and stop his criminal rampage. I thought Cusak was especially effective in his portrayal of the suspect. The ending reminded me of some of the better ""The Closer"" endings as Cage very effectively uses his only eyewitness against the suspect. As a lawyer, I was puzzled by the relunctance of the DA to proceed with prosecution even after the results of the searches of the suspect's property.

John Cusack is riveting as a soulless, subhuman man, frozen in humanity towards others, he plays a man that is like a robot, pretending to be decent and neighborly, but without kindness or true friendliness.  Just methodical and matter-of-fact.  He had been getting away with crimes against women for decades, and believed himself to be above the law.

It's on the long side. It reveals how complex our law enforcement is (and how it disables itself) and how complex this man was in his private world. Even though I came away with these sad understandings, the movie left me with a good feeling for the perseverance of those who truly care and how one person can make such a difference (both good and bad).

Like Romans 5:20 ""Wherever sin abounds, grace much more abounds."" This film is a testimony to the ones who righted the wronged. But realistically, the film never represented much more than a narrow escape, unlike the reference in Romans. .

You can throw money at the problem, You can throw agents, lawyers, doctors but only Christ, at His appearing; the real Jesus Christ, He is the solution for world corruption and the unrepentant cops and criminals alike, who are trying to escape big city corruption that is plaguing our nation and our world. The only words I have for this problem is that Jesus did in fact die an innocent man, and it seems to address the blood lust problem, confusing the judiciary, the legislators and those executing the enforcement.

5845743,5,B00DPL32ME,"Nicholas Cage plays a policeman who must prove that a religious well respected family man is a serial killer, responsible for the brutal murders of many young women over the span of more than a decade.  A terrific acting job by all the actors - Cage and Cusack at their usual best.  As someone watching the movie, I am reminded of some of the personal safety rules - the first one being never get into vehicles with strangers.  Most importantly, when someone is trying to abduct you, you need to scream, run, kick, resist - do NOT let anyone take you to a secondary location - even if they threaten you, or say that they have your mother's address, etc. Worry about the defense of your family later, should your abductor even have those further motives. These perpetrators' goal is to get you away from a public area where they can do their evil.  After they have committed crimes against you, no matter how much you plead and say you won't tell anyone, they will not take a chance and leave you alive.  Your best chance (not a guarantee) of survival is to not cooperate - don't let them take you anywhere, even with a gun to your head.  When you resist and scream, it immediately catches them off guard because it is going against their well-laid out plans.  I hope you remember these points if you watch this movie, and ask yourself that if you were the victim, when might you have had the opportunity to change your fate.",1402012800,,1424,4.453846153846154

Very surprised by Vanessa Hudgens--good job!  If you're a Breaking Bad fan you'll be happy to see Dean Norris (Hank) in the movie playing the part of a cop--he is great in his part and should have been featured more.  Downside is Nicholas Cage's wife and daughter.  Absolutely no character development so what was the point of having them in so many scenes?  It would have been better if the wife and daughter were on a trip to the lower 48 and checked in once or twice on the phone--could have used them to let Cage think out loud and there wouldn't have been any need to feature them very much.",1401840000,,762,4.4071428571428575

It was based on a real life serial killer Robert Hansen, played by John Cusack. I'm not a huge fan of typecasting but still it was hard to see John Cusack in a negative role as he was clearly uncomfortable with it. The plot is simple - Robert Hansen is a mild, stuttering man who is well-liked in his neighborhood but Sergeant Jack Halcombe played by Nicholas Cage and his team know that he is a serial killer and try really hard to find evidence to convict him with the help of Cindy Paulson, one of the victims of Robert Hansen who escaped.

5845840,4,B00DPL32ME,Good thriller about about a psychopath in Alaska. Cusack and Cage both did great jobs. Can't believe it is based on true events. Worth watching.,1401667200,,144,4.8

5845844,3,B00DPL32ME,"Passably done and moderately interesting, possibly because it takes place in a ""new"" place to me for movies: Anchorage.

5845851,4,B00DPL32ME,"Good movie. Well worth watching on TV. Not worth paying for at the movie theatre.
It is hard to believe that there are people in our society that are as sick and deminted as this man was.

Movie does tell us we need to listen to and care for victims instead of treating them like they did somethingwrong because of who they are. We need more caring, decent people like the character Nicholas Cage played.",1401667200,,404,4.386666666666667

5845855,4,B00DPL32ME,"I live in Alaska and a lot of Alaskans, myself, included were not happy with the making of this film. After watching it though, I think they did a good job in humanizing the victims as people rather than as just sex workers. I had to skip through a few scenes but, overall it wasn't in bad taste and did not glorify the murderer like some types of movies do. It also showed how brave the survivor is that helped put him away. Eklutna Annie is something that has always haunted me since I heard about these murders. She has still not been identified some 30 years later and is buried in a graveyard in downtown Anchorage.",1401580800,,620,4.3076923076923075
5845856,4,B00DPL32ME,"I have to give props to this film's producers: they actually filmed this story where it happened, in Anchorage, AK and the surrounding area.  I recognized all of the landmarks and the Knik River Valley where this monster buried his victims. I remember the story well.

My only nitpicks were:
1.  The streets of Anchorage were far too crowded.  That just doesn't happen there unless something like the Iditarod start is going on.  The strip clubs are all too real and they did huge business during the oil pipeline ramp-up, but foot traffic is almost never heavy.
2.  Nick Cage kept saying ""KINNick River"".  It's pronounced more like k'NIK.
3.  The central witness, a survivor of the psychopath, is shown talking to the cops over a handheld cellphone.  In 1983.  Not a chance.

Despite its editing choppiness, the film tells the story pretty well.  Cusack does his usual excellent job and Cage keeps the emoting to a minimum.",1401580800,,924,4.7784810126582276
5845857,4,B00DPL32ME,I thought the acting was very good and the plot held your attention. The fact it was based on a true story shows you how sick and evil some members of society are.,1401580800,,163,3.9696969696969697
5845858,1,B00DPL32ME,"This has to be one of  the worst films on a horrible subject (which, while it can and should be the subject of a film, needed to be treated with dignity, respect and care) which wasted the talents of excellent actors. The writing and directing were basic at best, rather like a high school play with wooden actors going through the motions the best they could with the material provided.

5845861,5,B00DPL32ME,The movie was very scary and entertaining at the same time. I remember reading about this serial killer and there was also a documentary on television about him. Wow a serial killer in Alaska. Talk about prime real estate to hide bodies. To think that this really happened makes it even scarier. The acting was great and credible. This is a must see.,1401494400,,350,4.571428571428571

5845865,2,B00DPL32ME,I watched it about half way through which was enough time to figure out the simple plot.  The actors never evolved from their initial introduction. John Cusack never fit the bill as a serial killer he would have played a child molester part better and Nicolas Cage is still too autocratic.,1401494400,,289,4.666666666666667

5845883,4,B00DPL32ME,"I liked it, but Nick Cage is a favorite of mine. Offers a disturbing look at the life of sex workers, abused kids that run away and nobody cares, fodder for just the kind of life pimps, pornographers and disturbed men want them for. They will never know for sure how many this guy killed, Alaska was and is and attractant to people like this because of its vast territory, under manned police, and seeming like they can't get caught. But then again similar things happen in the lower 48 too. Lot of sick minds out there.",1401408000,,520,4.371134020618556

5845887,3,B00DPL32ME,The movie was interesting. If you like crime drama's and stories about serial killers. I am a big Cusack fan. Sad story with a positive end. Did not realize it was a true story until the end.,1401408000,,191,4.1891891891891895

5845893,4,B00DPL32ME,"This is a realistic look at police work in the seedy side of an Alaskan town. Nicolas Cage gave an excellent, understated performance. His work is the best I've seen him do. John Cusack plays a serial killer with depth and realism. As the heavy, Cusack shows us the complicated character of the killer without asking for our sympathy. The outside scenes in the wilderness and the inner city were very interesting. I recommend the movie to anyone who meets the R rating cautions.
The movie has several scenes of nudity and sex that some viewers will find objectionable. I would restrict the viewing of this movie to adults at least 18 years old.",1401408000,,644,4.657894736842105
5845894,4,B00DPL32ME,"I'd never heard of this movie before I was it on Amazon prime.  It was sell done and gave a look at he Alaska we never see.  Most movies about Alaska emphasize the unspoiled wilderness and beauty of the state.  This film took place in Anchorage and showed the strip clubs and bars and prostitution.  The film centered on a prostitute who got away from a serial killer, a state trooper who believed her story and the serial killer.  John Cusack did an excellent job portraying a man who could be your next door neighbor but stalked and killed women.  The fact that this is a true story made it all the more thrilling.  The movie really didn't drag anywhere.  The only negative could be that there was little of the human side showing the character's love interests.  The trooper and the serial kilelr were both married with children but you saw little of their family drama. That doesn't bother me but some viewers may fine it more like a docudrama than an entertaining movie.  There was some brief nudity in the bar scenes but this is not a kid's movie.",1401408000,,1053,4.465968586387435

It's hard to say you like something when the subject is so dark and horrifying, but it was well done  The actors did their usual credible best.

We learn the ID of the perp early on but he proves to be an adept prey as well as an expert hunter. He used his devious talents to fool a whole town. It makes the local PD force look somewhat above incompetent for blindly assuming such a nice guy could be a serial killer. Of all people, serials generally appear normal to the average person, that's how they walk among us.

I looked up Butcher Baker online, and there are a few blogs and comments from people who actually knew him, bought bread from him and  never suspected a thing. Thank god for that one cop in the station that secretly went against the common thinking and sent the case file up the ladder to outside office of FBI, and how lucky that the survivor teenager finally reluctantly agreed to help, or this would have been an unsolved murder once the perp got too old.

I didn't hate the movie but I would never consider buying anything with this much language issues. It could have been done with less shock value.  I am disappointed in myself for not stopping the movie when I realized how much profanity they crammed into a mediocre film. The movie focused on the survivor of a serial killer but I think it would have been better if they gave a little more background to the trooper (Cage) for example, his wife switching from not supporting his efforts in the case to encouragement.

There are movies that i'm glad I watched (The Color Purple, Schnidler's List, etc) but I will never watch again. This is in that category - worth watching but difficult for my sensibilities.

It reminds me that people are not as they seem. Good or bad. That doesn't mean that we need to rush to judgment or trust everyone. We simply need to be aware that where there is good there may also be evil. There is safety in acknowledging that plain truth. The telling of this true story clearly shows both sides of that ubiquitous coin.",1401235200,,705,4.3816793893129775

I must of been under a rock as I didn't even remember this making the main stream news, as I am sure it did.

Characters were well developed, pacing of this movie was right on, this could of easily of been a 'seven' type thriller but I feel Scott moved this story along at a perfect pace.  I didn't feel any lag throughout this flick, I was always pulling for the good guys and am very pleased they did not glorify any of the horrific acts by Robert Hansen.

Overall great flick good suspense. Highly recommended.",1401235200,,715,4.476923076923077

Oh, and there might be a spoiler or two in here ... but I'm not telling anything you don't learn in the first 5 minutes or so of the film. Certainly nothing important.

This one was decent. Being based on a true story, I'm guessing they were sticking to historical accuracy, but I thought the story could have been a bit stronger. There was superfluous stuff about Cage's character that I thought just muddied the story. And I don't think they did a good enough job at the start of portraying Cusack as the image of an up-standing, law-abiding citizen. Frankly, one look at him in the film screamed ""serial killer!""

5845959,4,B00DPL32ME,"The movie was tightly woven and the characters were extremely well portrayed.  It was difficult adjusting to John Cusack as a bad guy, but he was terrific in his role.  Cage was once again, a superb actor in a role similar to others he has played.

A true story adapted for film, the heroine had so many faults it was initially hard to care whether she survived.  But, Cage's dedication to solving a string of serial murders involving her caused us to hope the girl survived her ordeal of kidapping, rape, and torture and all would end well for her.  She is a young prostitute, hooked on many different drugs, and trusts no one...until at the end she trusts Cage and his other police fellows.

The only fault I found with the film is the darkness.  And, I don't mean the storyline, I mean the film was mostly shot in the dark, in crowds, chasing around.  It made it hard to follow at times, and we did a lot of rewinding to find out what had happened and what was said.

All in all, however, I would recommend this movie for those who like murder, police stories, and adventure.",1401148800,,1078,4.376884422110553

Nic shows a side of his acting I have never seen, gritty, tough and determined.  John is chilling and very believable as Hansen, maybe too much.  Vanessa I never knew had that amount of depth in her, perhaps those musical movies didn't take all of her talent.

This movie is one I would actually watch over and over again and will buy on BR. If you like good crime drama, that makes you gasp at all the right places this is the one for you.

5845996,5,B00DPL32ME,Nicholas Cage is always good.  I enjoyed this movie.  It kept stopping and I had to keep going back and clicking on resume.  That was annoying.  I don't like it much when I am watching a movie and it does that.,1401062400,,210,4.048780487804878
5845997,5,B00DPL32ME,It is too bad that there wasn't that much hype for this movie in the theatres.  It is really a great movie and lots of action and suspense until the end.  John Cusack was excellent at playing the bad guy which is a different type of role for him.,1401062400,,246,4.0
5845998,4,B00DPL32ME,"Nicholas Cage has made some messy films, but 'The Frozen Ground' is an excellent film. What we see is the nitty gritty of a real investigation. After the downtown Alaska Police closed the files of several girls gone missing, Nicholas Cage's detective takes on the cases and discovers at least seven missing women which climbs to 17 and possibly 30.

Robert Hansen, played brilliantly by John Cusack, a mild mannered man who lived in Anchorage with his wife and children, is a serial killer. It takes many months, grueling hours and fighting the justice system for Cage's detective to bring him down. This is his story. Vanessa Hudgen plays a young 17 year old on her own, trying to make her way by selling her body for money. She had a very difficult childhood and ended up in Alaska. She was a victim of Robert Hansen, but she got away. The downtown Alaskan Police did not believe her because of her professional life. That is what these women were up against. The throw away women of our society. However, there were good policemen who wanted to serve their population, and this is also their story.  The gritty night life is portrayed in all it's ugliness and the black and white film brings it to the fore.

5846011,4,B00DPL32ME,"Nicolas Cage and John Cusack deliver tour de force performances in the story of an Alaskan serial killer during the 1980s. Both Cage and Cusack are brilliant in their roles as the dogged pursuer and the disturbed, calculating suspect.  While I cringe every time I see the victimization of women onscreen, thankfully The Frozen Ground kept the grim, torturous details to a minimum, instead concentrating on the cat-and-mouse relationship between the steely, driven Cage and the demented Cusack.

As a solid police procedural, this drama worked on several levels with believability and realism heightened by the Alaska location filming.  A fine look at the frustrations inherent in investigative police work pre-widespread computers and the internet.  A definite return to form for Cage, and yet another amazingly insightful job by Cusack.",1401062400,,837,5.415384615384616

Then, John Cusak showed up with his portrayal of the serial killer and the movie became more intriguig. Rather creepy knowing it is based on a true story and the guy was so successful for so long. The lighting, night shots, and wilderness shots do a nice job of conveying both the anonymity of the girls and the vastness of the countryside surrounding Anchorage.",1400976000,,481,4.738095238095238
5846020,5,B00DPL32ME,"What a great movie! Nicholas Cage is a detective in Alaska who is about to retire. His last case is a abduction/murder case. Vanessa Hudgens plays a exotic dancer/prostitute abducted and tortured by John Cusack, but escapes. The rest of the movie consists of detectives trying to prove their case against this killer who may have killed many more women. Very suspenseful and taut action scenes meshed with the splendor of Alaskan wilderness. Vanessa Hudgens is truly remarkable as ""Cindy"", a teenage runaway, who lives in the seedy underworld of Alaska's strip clubs and prostitution circles. She absolutely shines as Cindy. Cindy is a lost soul who has no one in her corner until Nicholas Cage's character befriends her. This former Disney star has some real acting skills. She is gonna be a star that everyone will remember. I loved this movie! Beautiful scenery and camera work. Very good casting. Excellent acting and direction. Watch it and enjoy it!",1400976000,,955,5.012578616352202
5846021,4,B00DPL32ME,I like most Nicolas Cage movies but didn't think the movie deserved the great movie status.  I do recommend it to anyone who likes serial killers movies.

5846033,3,B00DPL32ME,"John Cusack does a great job of being odd and normally commanding. Nicolas Cage has been pumping out movies and while I do not mind watching him work, I certainly don't look for him in movies. Mr. Cusack was not given enough time to really explore the bad guy he could have been in this movie and the amount of drivel that surrounds the tracking of him is just pathetic. If that is how things are done currently, I weep for the future of investigation into missing persons. That nonsense surrounded the acting of the young woman who escaped the serial killer. I can not remember her name but I will look for her in other movies.
I believed her. I looked right at her in several scenes and I believed her tale. As for Mr. Cusack and Mr. Cage, I remember them from their early days of comedy and antics and odd gestures in situations I viewed as stupid. It is very hard for me to take either one of them seriously. Watching their faces; I kept waiting for the out of place and plucky awkward-isms that they now avoid. I think much of this movies footage probably ended up in the recycle bin which is too bad because had they given Mr. Cusack more time - he could have killed more...oh wait, that's bad.",1400976000,,1200,4.314159292035399

5846045,4,B00DPL32ME,"Though this movie is about a true serial killer, one who was killing around the same time as the Green River Killer, just in Alaska, it's more a telling of the life of Cindy Paulson, and her horrifying experience.  I first read about Hansen in a John Douglas book (frankly, I can't remember if it was in MindHunter or Journey Into Darkness, but it was one of them), and had always thought of Paulson as the real hero of the story.  After all, this girl managed to get away from a serial killer who'd dispatched MANY MANY victims before her.  If there's any name you should remember, it should be that of Cindy Paulson.  After being kidnapped, raped, and truly would have been dead if she didn't run half naked down an Alaska road until someone picked her up and took her to the police station.  I always thought it a travesty she wasn't believed and was treated like dirt by the local police, and as the story shows, only after someone really looked into things did they realize the disgrace and injustice of the local legal system at the time.

Again, as someone whose known this story for 2 decades, I was a little suspicious I hadn't heard of the film, especially when it brings A listers like Cusack and Cage to it.  As others have stated, I'm thrilled they didn't glorify the killer, or turn it into a slasher flick, but rather told us Paulson's side of the story, with the truth of what happened to so many other women at the hands of a monster.  I watched it because I knew the back story... One thing they left out was one of the witnesses who said Hansen had been at his house playing cards the night of Paulson's rape later came forward and admitted he'd been asked by Hansen to lie, though Hansen had lied to the guy about with what crime he'd been a suspect, and I think that would have helped others KNOW they had the right guy.  I thought they left a small bit of doubt in the actual police case against Hansen, when in truth they had him dead to rights.

Anyway, despite watching it because I felt I knew the story, I actually found myself caught up in the film which is true testimony to the job done by the writers, actors, director, and producers.  If you enjoy true crime tales, This is absolutely worth the time.",1400889600,,2232,4.354216867469879

5846047,4,B00DPL32ME,"I like Nicholas Cage, so that drew me in.  The plot line starts out kind of slow and choppy, but it gets better.  The Alaskan backdrop is raw and stunningly, darkly beautiful, just the kind of place that this true story, unlikely anywhere else, could unfold the way it did.  I don't want to give away too much of the plot.  An appearance by F'ty Cent is always welcome and he handles his role with style and convincingly.

To the many victims and families involved, my condolences and deepest sympathies. To the survivor, God bless! The acting was very good and the storyline kept my interest level high throughout the film. I strongly recommend the film to of-age persons. Parents considering letting their children watch this movie should consider watching it alone first. The content is compelling and strong, but deals with prostitution, strippers, drug use, and nudity, along with murder. Overall great flick.",1400889600,,627,5.1568627450980395

5846071,4,B00DPL32ME,"This is one of the older movies that I had been wanting to see. Mainly because I like Nicholas Cage and John Cusack. Both can play just about any role and both proved it on this one. Nicholas Cage is a detective in Alaska following leads to a possible serial killer but his killing ground is in the mountains and wooded areas of Alaska so finding any connection to bodies, some never located is extremely hard. But he continues until he finds a common link. Like I mentioned it is an old move and based on true events and had it been a big budget movie it would have been an even greater movie. It does slow down a bit but picks up toward the end. It is worth seeing if only to watch two great actors trying to outwit each other.",1400803200,,729,4.140845070422535

He would keep them captive and force them to have sex for days (he offered them money but never paid them) and then would kill them.  The title was for how he left them on the ice and in the snow where they were not found for a long time.  He was a well known businessman who ran a bakery that many people.  The book I read was ""Butcher / Baker"" which describes him perfectly.  But he was a cold hearted sociopath that believed these women to be trash, beneath him, and not deserving of life.  He was convicted and sent to prison for life.  In the movie, Nicholas Cage plays the cop who chases him down.  This cop was supposed to retire in two weeks at the time that he got this case and most of the other cops dismissed the case because the women were hookers and their suspect was a respected businessman.  But this cop, the one played by Cage, was moved by the case and pursued it until an arrest was made.  Great story, great acting, true to the book as I recall it.

Its a little tough to watch at times, but overall I enjoyed it.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good thriller or are fans of serial killer movies.

The scenes for the Knik River are really the actual river.  So they did film this in Alaska, I applaud them.

Then I realized 30 minutes later that I was still watching.  Not even sure why but it just kept drawing me in.  The intensity began to increase & I needed to know how it ended.  Although I'm usually pretty good at guessing the endings to most movies, I wanted to see how this one played out on its own.  Yes, the setup of this movie was slow & detailed; but that made the ending twice as much fun!!!  What I hadn't realized was that this is a true event that occurred from 1973-1983.  That made the whole thing a lot more interesting!!!  By the end of this movie, I was emailing my friends & family to be sure to watch this one when they got the chance!!!  It's one of those movies that you're not sure you like until it comes full circle at the end & the way it is drawn together makes the WHOLE thing worth it!!!  All in all I am NOT sorry I watched this movie!!!  Honestly, I probably won't watch it again when alone & definitely would NOT buy the DVD.  Still it was well worth my time watching it on streaming; & IF in the right mood, I would not hesitate to share it with a visiting friend.  I just wouldn't want it sitting around collecting dust!!!

5846155,5,B00DPL32ME,"Too bad a movie like this has to be based on fact and not fiction.  But, its good the story is out there and hopefully it never happens again.

Nicolas Cage portrays an Alaska State Trooper who wears a tie and sees beyond what is obvious to piece together the puzzle of deaths Mr. Robert Hansen has committed.  He uses wit and sly tactics to outsmart the perpetrator when the system doesn't work well.

Actress Vanessa Hudgens portrays Cindy Paulson who helps Jack Halcombe (Nicolas Cage) track down Robert Hansen who is portrayed by John Cusack.  Vanessa's Native American descent and looks gives the role realism and believability.  Her back street vernacular brings street creed to her role as a stripper and prostitute.

""The Frozen Ground"" is a very good movie that shows how tough Alaska is and how ruthless it's people can be.  I doubt you'll fall asleep during this movie.",1400544000,,880,4.743421052631579

This one really just didn't do it for me, though. It's not bad, it's just that I know they both can do much better work. I was disappointed. Maybe it was because they identifed the killer too soon, eliminating the suspense. Maybe it was because neither of them seemed very excited about the story itself. Maybe it was because their only surviving witness, who could help them solve the murders, wasn't as terrified as I'd expect her to be (although she certainly wasn't ""calm"" about the whole thing). All in all, this one's OK for a Saturday popcorn night if you're doing something else at the same time and don't need to watch every scene. Other than that, bleh.

Nic Cage is passionate in an understated, professional way, just as we like to think real cops would be in this horrific situation. I can't describe the shocking nature of some scenes without spoiling it, but, no, I'm not referring to the topless bar or the sex scenes. Those are part of the underside of Anchorage where the serial killer hunts and, if anything, the very banality of the day-to-day life of the killer and, yes, the ordinariness of the killer himself are the most frightening things. The excellent reviews by those who knew the killer in real life reinforce this (which is even more horrifying). They say this guy was ordinary, a part of life in Anchorage, but it was only his disguise. The casting of marvelous talent for the roles of the young victims and the other young women who help them on the streets and in the bars is part of a trend I noticed in the last season of The Killing. I hope Hollywood and the indies continue to promote young talent and, eventually, find some parts for them other than street kids. The quality of the acting in this movie across the board makes me want to find some other streaming gems to watch.",1400544000,,1299,4.508474576271187

This movie buffered at least 4 times and dropped from HD to SD several times.  The last movie I streamed from Amazon did the same.

Not sure what the actual original events were, but get the details right and the storyline gets better and more believable - because the acting and story tension is good in this film.

I'm surprised I hadn't heard about this movie before  but it seems like one of those that is pretty good but doomed to obscurity.  It is gritty and realistic in it's telling so it can be violent and certainly seedy at times but that's real life when you're talking about a serial killer and where he hunts his victims.

It is a measure of the film that I kept watching.  If it hadn't been well done and well set-up I would have stopped the film and never gone back to it. Now that I've watched it I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys police procedural dramas.  This was gritty and dark but satisfying in that it was believable, well-acted, and the good guys triumphed.

The movie is based on a true story, the young prostitute is NOT a cliche as someone wrote, she is a living breathing person subjected to sexual abuse as a child and then becomes just another girl selling herself to survive.

5846232,4,B00DPL32ME,"I find that the best thrillers come from films that are based on real life events. Some of these stories are just so twisted and crazy, that even the best writer wouldn't be able to imagine them on their own. The story told in the film The Frozen Ground, is one such story, telling the world about serial killer, Robert Hansen. From the 1970s until 1983, Hansen was one of the nations most prolific serial killers. What makes Hansen's story unique is that he was able to do all this, without the police even connecting the cases, because of where he lived. Hansen's story begins in Anchorage Alaska, where he began preying on prostitutes. After torturing and killing them, he would dump the bodies in remote, unpopulated areas of Alaska, where they were ravaged by the weather and wild animals. This made finding the cause of death or even identifying the victims nearly impossible. Hansen would probably still be active today, if it wasn't for Cindy Paulson, the only victim in 12 years, to escape the madman, and that's where our film begins. Nicholas Cage stars as Jack Halcombe, a state police detective who comes up with a wild theory that all these missing people and strange deaths, could be connected. Halcombe has a tough time convincing anyone of this, especially since his only witness is a drug abusing prostitute. Nicolas Cage excels in movies like this and is again terrific. Cage was born to play a cop and in my opinion does it better than anyone else out there. In this film, he's paired with Zac Efron's ex, Vanessa Hudgens, who wasn't great, but was much better than I expected. It's difficult to make the transition from Disney cover girl to a legitimate movie star, but I'd say that Hudgens is well on her way. Finally, John Cusack rounds out this all-star cast, playing Robert Hansen. After all the films I've seen Cusack in, I really couldn't imagine him as the bad guy, but his performance is what really helps this movie stand out, and hopefully will lead him to other similar roles. The Frozen Ground is a little slow, but it is supposedly very accurate, and tells an interesting story that most people know nothing about. It's the kind of film that I really go for and hopefully you will too.",1397347200,,2219,4.648854961832061

Although there were places that were sort of corny, it was a really good movie and we caught ourselves talking about it after.  Funny.  Glad we watched it.",1396742400,,306,4.224137931034483
5846235,4,B00DPL32ME,"2014 is already up and running and showing no signs of slowing down. I have not been doing as many reviews as I would definitely like to, but I am consistently working to get better and have more done in time for the summer. Just today, I came across a movie that was not at all familiar to me but one that I enjoyed watching. Lets talk about The Frozen Ground.

In the movie, Cindy Paulson is found in a horrific condition by officers and later questioned by Sergeant Jack Halcombe. Upon learning the details of what has happened to her, Jack and Cindy must work to take down our antagonist Robert Hansen. And so our movie begins.

Like normal, I start with the acting. I must say I was impressed with everyone's acting in the film; especially Vanessa Hudgens's and Joan Cusack's performances. Also great in his role as the lead Officer Jack Halcombe, Nicholas Cage who encompasses the character with resolve and skill.

It is not always the easiest film to watch, but The Frozen Ground is a solid movie for the movie viewer. I rate this movie:

8/10

5846237,5,B00DPL32ME,"This is actually a very good movie, entertaining while trying to be as accurate as they could to this true story (well, as accurate as Hollywood can).  The film was shot entirely in and around Anchorage and shows some of the places where actual events took place (for example Merrill Field, the very busy airport in the heart of town).  The cinematography is quite good although it's difficult to film a bad landscape in Alaska and some of the vistas that are shown, especially during the flying sequences, are stunning.

Really enjoyed the movie and the two principal actors, John Cusack and Nicolas Cage are very good.  Cusack is always consistently good and it's intriguing to see him play the bad guy here.  Cage's performance is (for once) quite reserved and captures the character of the weary Alaska State Trooper very well.  Recommended...",1396224000,,847,4.888111888111888
5846238,4,B00DPL32ME,"This is based on a true story about an Alaskan serial killer who got away with hunting women for years and the police officer (Nicolas Cage) who finally brought him to justice with the help of the only woman who got away, a prostitute-- whose complaint of kidnapping and rape was discounted by the ""good old boys"" at the department who said that the ""family man"" she accused could not have possibly done it, and was called to the attention of the detective investigating the crimes by the one officer who believed that she was telling the truth. The vastness of the wilderness and the fact that the killer flew his own small plane allowed him to distribute the remains of his victims in out-of-the-way areas where they were not likely to be found, and after finally confessing, the killer led the police to the remains of 17 victims as part of his plea deal.

It was a one day rental and I just never got around to viewing it again.
Because I am such a skinflint I will have to wait til it is either free or VERY low cost to rent again. Damn, sometimes I make my own life simply miserable!!
I hope my rental helped Mr. Cage in his ongoing quest to satisfy the IRS. Apparently he had an accountant/attorney that either burned him or dropped the ball as far as keeping up with his taxes and got into some paypack difficulty. That is one reason why the poor guy makes what seems like 200 movies a year......paying back the people that spy on us for no other reason than the President we now have wants to control the people that disagree with him.....which has to be a LOT of people considering how lousy and incompetent the idiot Socialist jerk has been.

Ironically, I felt that the subject could have been better served if Cage and Cusack weren't in the film.  It could have been a great documentary like Imposter.  Somehow the pacing and styling of the film didn't (as it was intended to) creep me out.  It felt too much like a Hollywood telemovie than a gritty unfolding.

One reason is the cast - we're too conditioned to watching Cage - and Cusack - as stars.  Cusack has invested too much of his career playing nice guys that even now, as a psychopath - he doesn't feel like all that bad a guy.  A lesser known cast might have made this work better and another director.  Still, it's not a bad film, but this is not a David Fincher level film.

5846269,2,B00DPL32ME,"The Frozen Ground is a thriller starring Nicolas Cage and John Cusack that had a very limited theatrical run before being released on DVD and Blu-ray.  The film is based on the true story of serial killer Robert Hansen.  Between 1971 and 1983, Hansen murdered between 17 and 21 women near Anchorage, Alaska. He was convicted in 1983 and is currently serving 461 years in Spring Creek Correctional Center in Seward, Alaska.  Cage plays Alaskan State Police Detective Jack Halcombe (based on real life Detective Glenn Flothe) who only has a couple of weeks left on the job before he is set to start a new position outside of police work.

Halcombe gets assigned the case of an 18 year-old runaway who was allegedly abducted and raped by Hansen.  However her case was never prosecuted due to the lack of evidence.  When a decomposed body turns up whose cause of death is similar to several other unsolved murders, Halcombe begins to investigate several cold case murders and disappearances of young, local women.  Everything points to Hansen, now a prominent local businessmen and Jack has to find the evidence to take down the killer.

The Frozen Ground is a pure connect-the-dot thriller that features solid performances from Cage, Cusack, and especially Vanessa Hudgens as Cindy Paulson, the runaway who escaped Hansens clutches.  The film also features a strong supporting cast including 50 Cent as an Anchorage street pimp, Radha Mitchell as Jacks wife, and Kurt Fuller as the District Attorney.  But despite the strong cast Director Scott Walker is content for the standard cat and mouse game of cop and killer and attempts to add nothing new to make the plot standout.  Weve seen this type of police procedural done much better in other films.

Surprisingly it was not a B. First of all it was based on a true story (which was very sad in itself) but lent for a thrilling movie for sure.

Besides the poor reviews i really liked this movie. Cage is great as the sergeant and although a bit stiff (as usual to be honest) seems like a very dedicated and honorable hero for this film. Acting like a father figure for the character Cindy because she doesn't really have one. John Cusack was amazing as the serial killer Robert Hansen (Hanson?) acting like the typical guy next door who you wouldn't suspect as a killer but underneath his clean cut demeanor is the evil that always leaks out. Both characters are overly obsessed in their own ways, the sergeant with catching and exposing the killer and robert for hunting down these women and murdering them and this film shows how they act out these obsessions very well. I don't mind the stiff cage acting as thats just how he acts and i've become used to it but other then that, a few silly lines here and there and some cliched good cop bad cop moments this was a good thriller. Not one i intend on watching over and over but i'm sure i will watch it again sometime soon.

I found out way too soon who the bad guy was and from there on it was a wait-and-see how he was going to get caught.  The movie was based on a true story which happened in the early 80's.

Good acting, and it touched me deeply because it's about a sociopathic killer preying on sex workers in the 1980s in Alaska, and the police didn't want to stop the killings because the killer was a business owner and the girls were regarded as human garbage.

I had to work as a stripper before, and though it's only a job people look at you like you're lower than dirt.  What I loved about this story is that it brought home the truth that surface appearances are deceiving and a Mr. Normal, the pillar of the community persona may be a facade hiding a monster.

Also, the detective who fought for the girls and the young girl victim who also helped instead of leaving town, a streetwalker who had been violated by relatives as a child and was trying to survive on her own because living with her family was not an option (at least as a sex worker she got paid), were heroes.",1388016000,,934,4.350574712643678

AS I WATCHED THE MOVIE, IT DAWNED ON ME WHY IT SEEMED FAMILIAR.

THE DOCUMENTARY WAS ACTUALLY MORE GRAPHIC AND THE SERIAL KILLER IN THE STORY HAD A LONG TRACK RECORD OF COMMITTING HEINOUS ACTS WOMEN...TO THIS DAY WE MAY NEVER RECOVER ALL THE BODIES OR KNOW THE TRUE DEATH COUNT.

CAGE AND CUSACK PLAY THEIR PARTS VERY WELL.  I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT AWARE OF THIS KILLING SPREE THAT WENT ON FOR MANY, MANY YEARS- THANKS TO POOR POLICE WORK AND PEOPLE COVERING UP FOR THE KILLER BECAUSE HE WAS DEEMED ONE OF THOSE PILLAR OF SOCIETY TYPES IN HIS TOWN.

HOW SAD.... WITH HIS BACKGROUND RECORD- SO MANY LIVES COULD HAVE BEEN SAVED, IF HE HAD BEEN TREATED LIKE ANYONE ELSE WHO GETS INTO TROUBLE WAY TOO OFTEN.

THIS IS A CASE OF WHEN THE LAW AND TOWNSPEOPLE LOOK THE OTHER WAY- THE END RESULT IS PEOPLE DIE NEEDLESSLY.

I think that every film commentry should mention whether there is nudity in it, and to what value, so movie lovers such as myself can make a better, more informed, choice, and not be so surprised by the torrent of nudity in many films of today. For those who like nudity in their movies I say ""well ok, good for you"" however for those of us who are tired of being surprised by its content in a movie that did not at first indicate such content, reviers like the one I'm talking about are a God send.",1386028800,,1016,4.205128205128205
5846365,3,B00DPL32ME,"The good things about this movie:
*It really is based on the true story of a series of killings that took place in Alaska in the 1970's-80's. It doesnt just use those crimes as a coat hanger on which to hang all sorts of extreme elaborations and fabrications. It stays as close to some of the real events as a popular movie can be expected to stay.
*In keeping with its realism, it was largely filmed on location, giving audiences a sense of Anchorages steely industrial nature and its icy insularity.
*It keeps to a clean line of good versus evil. It doesnt feel it necessary to muddy the proceedings by giving the lead police officer on the case, played by Nicholas Cage, an artificially anguished background of battling alcoholism, ex-wives, and failed fatherhood.
*There are extensive bonus features on this DVD, including a fairly interesting producer/director commentary.

The bad things about this movie:
It never really comes off the screen and develops into a memorable three-dimensional portrayal. The intentions of everyone connected with the film were good. They wanted, not so much to magnify the deeds of the killer, but to show the humanity of his victims. They particularly wanted to feature the experiences of the killers one surviving victim who then becomes key to tracking him.

But this young woman, who, like the killers other victims, was practicing as a prostitute in the large Red Light District of testosterone-soaked Anchorage, never did become quite real or comprehensible, to me at least. We don't get to fully understand why, after her narrow escape from the killer, she would risk going back, not only generally to her old life as a prostitute - but specifically to the bars her killer is likely to frequent and where hes likely to spot her again. Her actions, as portrayed here, seem too self-destructive to be believable.

So in general, this is an earnest attempt at representing a crime, but I found that as soon as I finished the movie, it started to melt from my memory, like the ice on Anchorage streets come springtime.",1385769600,,2058,4.8575498575498575

5846407,5,B00DPL32ME,"I enjoy films that are based on true events, especially when the film adaptations are horror or thrillers.  THE FROZEN GROUND is a dash of both, and this adaptation is very entertaining.  It also stars a couple of actors that I really like:  Nicholas Cage and John Cusack.  Both do an excellent job in this flick, and the result is a great film worthy of your attention.

I wasn't sure what to expect going into this one.  I knew what it was about, but I wasn't sure if a full movie could be made about the topic, especially since the audience would already know who the killer was going into it.  But Im happy to report the writer and production team do a fantastic job of weaving an intense tale within this film.  It never once lags nor disappoints in any way.

THE FROZEN GROUND is shot well and looks amazing onscreen.  I tip my hat to the cinematography crew for capturing the majesty of Alaska (the film is shot on-location in and around Anchorage); the backdrops alone are enough of a reason to watch this movie.

But the story and characters are truly what drive this picture.  Set in 1983, the film is a powerhouse of emotional turmoil and undulating suspense as it recreates the events that led up to the capture of Robert Hansen.  The cast does an amazing job in their roles (and yes, I am one of the minority of people who thinks Nicholas Cage can act).  I am particularly impressed with Vanessa Hudgens, who portrays the young prostitute that escapes Hansens captivity; she owns her role with the zeal and talent of a veteran screen actress.

If I were forced to find a flaw with THE FROZEN GROUND, I simply could not do so.  Theres nothing wrong with the film in my opinion.  It looks great, the acting is top notch, and the story moves at a perfect pace.  For these reasons, I recommend giving this film a look.  It is suspenseful and powerful, a perfect flick to warm up these chilly nights.  The film is available now in a variety of formats.",1383523200,,1960,4.421787709497207

This movie would have been exceptional without any of the nudity. Nicolas Cage and John Cusack were intriguing and acted well.  Hutchenson was terrible.  However, I could not recommend this movie to anyone.  All the porn and drug use was disgusting!!!",1383436800,10,472,4.626506024096385
5846410,4,B00DPL32ME,"Anchorage in summer is the place where tens of thousands of tourists arrive by air, road, or cruise ship to see mainland Alaska.  Half an hour from Anchorage in any direction puts the visitor in the middle of the some of the most beautiful wild country left in North America.  Anchorage itself is pretty enough in summer.  In winter, however, the visitors leave, and Anchorage folds back in on itself, to hunker down and wait out the long cold dark.  Once upon a time, it was a happy hunting ground for a serial killer...

""The Frozen Ground"" is the dramatization of the investigation into serial killer Robert Hansen of Anchorage, still known as ""butcher baker"" among local law enforcement.  Nicholas Cage plays stalwart Alaska State Trooper Jack Halcombe, who leads the investigation, assisted by Vanessa Hudgens as the young prostitute Cindy, one of Hansen's would-be victims who managed to escape.  John Cusack is chilling as the seemingly unremarkable Hansen, a baker, husband and father with a vicious hobby.  The movie includes a prolonged dive into the gritty underbelly of Anchorage, with its bars, prostitution, drug use, and violence, where a clever killer could hang out for years without even being noticed.

The viewer knows early the identity of the killer; the drama of the movie is in the struggle to find the evidence to arrest Hansen before he can kill again.  At the end, Halcombe and his law enforcement partners will be pushed into a tough corner, racing the clock to get Hansen before he can get rid of the evidence and the principal witness.  The movie benefits from its location shooting in and around Anchorage, including the Knik River, the Chugach Mountains, and the Matanuska Glacier.  The dark and the cold help shape the atmospherics of a tense thriller, told almost in documentary style.  It is a solid movie with a disturbing after-taste, although it might mean less to outsiders than to Alaskans who can appreciate how it all played out.

5846421,5,B00DPL32ME,"""Frozen Ground"" displays the Alaskan wilderness to perfection, in all its cold and terrible beauty.  Even within the city of Anchorage, the winter's darkness rules, snow covers the roads, and in one great scene, the heroine confronts a moose in a back alley (yep, that happens in Anchorage!)

And then we go inside out of the cold:  into the middle class home of the policeman, and of the killer.  The latter glories in a basement lined with animal trophies he has collected over the years:  he is, after all, a really ace hunter.  The other warm places are the bars and stripjoints, dimly lit, and crowded with men on a party, loaded with Pipeline money, and the girls plying their own trades of stripping and prostitution.  (Actually, I wonder if there was pole dancing back then?  I don't think so.)

The acting was first rate.  John Cusack was up to his usual high standard.  Nicholas Cage was a totally believable policeman.  And Vanessa Hudgens did a very fine job as Cindy the One who Got Away from the killer.  She looks like a baby at times, and then rolls to sullen, and then blank fear.  The cop's wife was a weak story and a weak role for any actress; in fact, almost embarrassingly foolish.  But this was the only part of the movie that disappoints.

This is not a slasher movie.  It takes the real story of the killings seriously, and carefully.  And it treats the victims with respect.",1383177600,,1400,4.554216867469879

How can we introduce porn and make it seem like it's a necessary part of the movie? The porn and the gratuitously graphic language have no point.  It's not a thriller, not psychologically interesting.  The fact that someone would do this with a supposedly real event makes me question who we are.  I can't understand any actor willing to do this, but what is the matter with women?  The word ""No"" and having some dignity isn't more important than the money, is it?

5846427,4,B00DPL32ME,"For a movie I had never heard of with these two I thought this finished product must have been less than ideal for a straight to DVD romp.  However this movie was a nice lil surprise and I highly recommend it, especially if you like this genre.  Both actors were outstanding in the movie, John Cusack as criminal and Nicholas Cage as the cop. The story is about Cusack and his shady past but rehabiltated image as a well liked man in the local donut/bakery/coffee shop family man who is hiding a dark secret.  Cage is a Detective who is 2 weeks away from a transfer and gets assigned the typical homicide case that turns out to be more than a mouthful.  Cage's intensity helped a lot and you could feel it in his performance.  Cusack, who I had never seen in this sort of role was great as you could see and feel the pressure and tension mounting on both characters.  In the middle is a young female victim who is a witness who wasn't taken seriously by investigators bc of her social class and character, she's a teen prostitute runaway.

This is a movie based on real events which also always adds a bit of authenticity for me but there were those moments that just weren't fleshed out that great.  I'm a stickler for detail and this was missing attention to it at times and the story of Cusack could have been developed a bit more considering the historical perspective we have on his character.  We just sort of jump right in and take off running which isn't always bad but there was a fair amount of material to draw from and seemed like a missed opportunity.  Overall though it was really good, 50 cent cast as a pimp with long-braided hair was pretty funny. Not a good personal look for him and I'm also not a fan of him in movies at all, he has a descent amount of screen time and thought that could have been better served by an actor  instead of a hip-pop star.",1383004800,,1871,4.317142857142857
5846428,3,B00DPL32ME,"Inspired by a real-life case of a serial killer Robert Hansen, The Frozen Ground stars Nicholas Cage as an Alaska state trooper Jack Halcombe determined to bring the murderer to justice. To do so, Jack needs a help from a teenage girl named Cindy Paulson (Vanessa Hudgens), the only survivor of the killing spree of Robert Hansen (John Cusack), who passes for an upstanding citizen.

Story-wise The Frozen Ground doesnt break any new ground. The truths about what Robert Hansen did to the victims are shocking, but the story itself seems very formulaic, with a concluding third act that is a bit too short. Interestingly, writer/director Scott Walker spends considerable time following the relationship between Jack and Cindy, while some viewers might want to see Jack hunting down the killer.

With strong performances from Nicolas Cage and Vanessa Hudgens, their characters are both convincing. John Cusack is also effective, creepy as a methodical murderer, while Radha Mitchell is wasted as Jacks wife. The atmospheric thriller is uneven; sometimes it is brilliant with realistic descriptions, sometimes it is just bad

Nicolas Cage and John Cusack were perfectly cast in the roles, respectively, of the Alaska State Trooper and the prolific serial killer he wanted to stop. Vanessa Hudgens was also excellent in the role of the prostitute that escaped the clutches of the killer.

I enjoyed seeing the scenery of Anchorage and the surrounding rugged wilderness, too. I've been up there before (near this same time period) and the movie brought back many memories.

Halcombe sets out to end the murderous rampage of Robert Hansen, a serial killer who has silently stalked the streets of Anchorage for more than 13 years. As the bodies of Anchorage women start to add up, Sgt. Halcombe goes on a personal manhunt to find the killer. When 17-year-old Cindy Paulson escapes Hansen's unspeakable violence, she believes the law will take him down. Instead she finds herself, once again, fighting for her life. With his only ally, Cindy Paulson, Sergeant Halcombe is determined to bring the serial killer to justice.

This movie gives a gritty true to life display of the events that occurred in Alaska many years ago.  The movie is very well paced and does a good job at filling the movie with tension at a frenetic pace.

Cage is solid in the role as the detective and Cusask who I am not normally a fan of, does a great job as the mild mannered pathological serial killer.  Hudgens also does a great job at playing the prostitute who survives the killers attack.

""Cusack"" does a splendid job given how the Director chose to choreograph the film, and while ""The FROZEN GROUND"" doesn't capture the raw creepiness, anxiety, and maddening angst of ""INSOMNIA"", it is well worth viewing on many levels!  --GBJ",1381104000,,770,5.408333333333333

I can't say enough about the movie other than you will not be sorry for renting it. There is not any point in this movie where you find yourself bored. It's viewer engaging from beginning to end.
I'd like to thank Cindy Paulson for telling her story.  I wish her well in her new life.  May God Bless her, I'm glad she finally had faith in Jack.  He saved her life..

5846495,4,B00DPL32ME,"THE FROZEN GROUND does a straightforwardly fine job of telling the story of 1980s Alaska serial killer Robert Hansen. It's easily the best based-upon-fact murder film to come along in some time. The keen use of settings brings about that crucial realism. Cusack and Cage both give impressive performances as Hansen himself and Alaska State Detective Jack Halcombe, a rather uncoppish cop (typical role for Cage). Vanessa Hudgens is spectacular as would-be victim Cindy Paulson; many of the other supporting cast also give excellent performances, particularly Curtis ""50-Cent"" Jackson as Paulson's sometime-pimp. THE FROZEN GROUND relates the police investigation with all its little holes, inconsistencies, and disagreements most convincingly. The film also gives a realistic--I assume, never having personally been there, of course--portrayal of the Anchorage underworld and red light district. Some gore and partial nudity: THE FROZEN GROUND is tasteful as possible without pulling any punches. Last but far from least, some of the small, apparently insignificant details--e.g., the moose in the alleyway--add oh-so-much in the way of subtle mood and symbolism.

This may have been hard to avoid, but it might worked better if the killer's identity was not made clear so early in the film and if more of the other  suspects had been brought into the picture. That way, there would have been some element of surprise for those not already familiar with this case, which isn't all that well-known. A bit more on Hansen's sickly unique M.O. might also have helped distinguish THE FROZEN GROUND. Finally, I wanted to see more on how exactly Paulson managed to escape Hansen, as well as why he managed to avoid arrest immediately after she did.",1380758400,2,1741,5.281588447653429
5846496,4,B00DPL32ME,"Let me first begin by saying that I am not a fan of Nicolas Cage, and there's maybe only one of two films that he's been a part of that I've actually enjoyed.  This doesn't mean I have some sort of vendetta against the man or his work - other than his style of acting not being my cup of tea.  For a man that was (at one point) on the verge of playing Superman, Cage sure has taken lead roles in some completely lackluster films - including Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance, Drive Angry, and Stolen (with several more on top of those).  With that being said, the fact that it's been quite a while since Cage has been relevant has not bothered me in the slightest.  Truth be told, Cage will have to work extra hard to get back into Hollywood's spotlight, assuming he ever wants to be there.  In any event, he appears to be on the right track, starring in the new drama, The Frozen Ground.

Scott Walker makes his writing and directorial debut with The Frozen Ground, starring Nicolas Cage as Jack Halcombe - an Alaskan police sergeant that is assigned a case to bring a serial killer to justice.  For more than 15 years, Robert Hansen (John Cusack) has blended in with the community as an upstanding, respectable citizen - while secretly abducting, raping, and murdering young teenage girls.  His latest victim, a prostitute named Cindy Paulson (Vanessa Hudgens), is able to escape Hansen's clutches, but when she tells her story to the police, they don't believe her.  When Paulson's story is brought to Sgt. Halcombe's attention, he takes it upon himself to protect her while searching for enough evidence to put Hansen behind bars.  Curtis Jackson, Dean Norris, and Radha Mitchell also star in supporting roles.

Surprisingly, Nicolas Cage is on the top of his game in the role of Sgt. Halcombe.  When we first meet Halcombe, he's preparing to exit his job and start a new chapter in his life.  However, things change when he's put in charge of a series of murders that all resemble the same pattern:  the murder of young girls.  While Cage portrays the generic law enforcement lead - driven, ambitious, and won't settle for failure - he still manages to bring a realistic emotion to a character that rarely displays physical emotion.  This lead character, haunted by the death of his sister from an automobile accident, doesn't let death define him, yet this tragic incident provides another dimension to an otherwise predictable character.  All in all, this is probably Cage's most impressive role since World Trade Center.

While I'm mostly on the wrong side of the fence when it comes to Nicolas Cage, I would certainly call myself a fan of Cage's fellow co-star, John Cusack.  The careers of Cage and Cusack sort of mirror each other in terms of their popularity and status in the limelight.  Neither would be considered major stars, but both have a loyal following.  Both Cage and Cusack, previously collaborating on the 1997 summer blockbuster, Con Air, are back together and mesh together rather well in their reunion.  Cusack isn't exactly the most calculating villain in this flick, but he does an admirable jump - easily comparable to Robin Williams's villainous character in Insomnia.  From the very beginning, viewers are aware of who the bad guy is, and will go through the dramatic motions of various interactions in which the villain escapes being caught.  Unfortunately, Cusack's interaction with Cage is minimal and doesn't even occur until nearly three quarters of the way through the film - but the build-up is still worth the wait.

I'm on record of being against musicians taking their ""talents"" to acting, especially when it comes to singers like Britney Spears, Miley Cyrus, and Selena Gomez.  More often than not, their appearance in a film alone is enough to warrant a terrible review for a film.  However, in the case of Vanessa Hudgens - she has managed to work her way around joining the club of pre-mentioned singers turned ""actresses.""  Hudgens certainly stands out in that particular crowd, showing signs of potential in previous roles, like Spring Breakers and Sucker Punch (I said signs of potential).  She also shows signs of potential in various scenes in The Frozen Ground, mostly when she's drugged out or weeping in a police station - but the potential is there.  Surprisingly, she is given quite a bit of screen time, and doesn't completely bomb with it.  It's quite possible her future might be in film after all.  It might be low-budget, straight-to-video film, but that's film none-the-less.

More often than not, The Frozen Ground features an attention-sustaining pace - even though you can quickly predict the film's inevitable outcome.  The fact that this film is a true story, based on the murders committed by Robert Hansen between 1971 and 1983, at least provides a bit of history to go along with a foreseeable outcome.  There are shades of Christopher Nolan's Insomnia sprinkled all over this film, mostly since you'll be able to see the lives of two men taking different paths that will eventually intersect with one another.  The characters are written well, given average back stories, but really lack a big name presence that would have given this film much more attention than it did.  Like many flicks that only briefly land in theaters, The Frozen Ground went to on-demand and quickly to home video.  Was it worth a trip to the theater?  Probably not, unless you're a Cage or Cusack follower - but since you no longer need to leave your couch to watch this flick, it is certainly worth a view.

5846505,4,B00DPL32ME,"Good movie! Worth the money, it was a taut, engrossing psychological thriller. Though there are some actions scenes, it was more suspense than any kind of shoot 'em up/car chase action film. Well cast, Nicolas Cage did an excellent job and I think this is one of his best roles.

Effective use of cold, gray, snowy, wild Alaskan landscape, really set the mood for this film. If they ever want to do a horror film there, Alaska would be a good choice...sort of , at least in this film, had that creepy, gray, bleak, austere, X-file-ish vibe you get in so many horror/thriller films, but with the added elements of danger from the elements and just the utter isolation. People almost feared the landscape or lived in denial of its alien beauty, not speaking of it or even looking at it directly, living crowded together in squalid, run down, crime infested streets or in quaint suburbs, though just a few feet outside the door is the cold, driving snow, and the uncaring distant mountains.

The movie even had a few moments of beauty, which I thought elevated the film.

Set in the early 1980s, effective use also of period elements without being overwhelming, the focus of the movie, or in any way making me at least the viewer disrespect or underestimate the protagonists and antagonists (if one was encouraged or forced to laugh at some element of 1980s culture or technology, I think it would have undermined the film; that did not happen).",1379721600,8,1442,4.691699604743083

He murdered roughly 20 women before his arrest in the 1980s. Where ""The Frozen Ground"" succeeds is its unflinching look at Cindy Paulson, a victim who escaped the clutches of Hansen and told her story to disinterested authorities.

In one of the great performances of the year, Vanessa Hudgens portrays Paulson as a haunted, street-wise loser. She's a runaway, scrapping a survivor's living as a part-time prostitute and full-time drug addict. She represents the high-risk lifestyle that serves as fodder for so many Hansen-like monsters. That she is turned into a sympathetic human being, undeserving of the cruelty dumped upon her by a variety of pimps and dealers, is one of the film's unexpected accomplishments. These female lost souls can be found in every city, chain smoking and fidgety, unjustly destined for ugly ends.

""The Frozen Ground"" has a better-than-deserved cast, including Nicolas Cage as local investigator Jack Halcombe and John Cusack as Hansen. Both actors, perhaps past their prime, having soared for decades with a variety of career peaks, serve up earnest portrayals. Cage's unorthodox intensity works well as he doggedly examines each crime scene, leading to the obligatory shot of him standing before victim photographs and stating, ""What am I missing?!"" After Hudgens's Paulson leaves the police station and disappears into the seedy side of Anchorage, Cage realizes she may be the key to cracking the case.

These scenes are paralleled by Cusack's Hansen stalking another victim, including uncomfortable detail of his modus operandi. In reality, Hansen played it straight after Paulson's escape (she actually served as a technical adviser on this film), though the walls crumbled when police searched his home. Part of the suspense of ""The Frozen Ground"" hinges on authorities being unable to obtain a search warrant due to Hansen's positive reputation in the community, including having a wife and kids and being the proprietor of a popular bakery.

Where ""The Frozen Ground"" also succeeds is its extraordinary on-location filming in Alaska. There is no doubt this film was entirely made within the state, with snow-covered streets and gray slush covering every frame. Skies are overcast, actor's faces are a variety shades of maroon and breath plumes from their shivering mouths. When Cage's Halcombe enters several strip clubs in search of Paulson, it's apparent these locales are real, with extras as authentic as a documentary.

As the film ends, each Hansen victim is shown, an extended segment as we see photographs of numerous women, their names and the year they disappeared. It's a startling touch making us realize the overwhelming horror of this true story. Walker's film maintains emotional honesty by not only giving the victims faces, but in attempting to detail through Paulson the daily grind of outcast women living difficult lives. Authentic and gritty, ""The Frozen Ground"" is less about Hansen than the kind of women stalked by more than one monster within our society.",1378944000,,4735,5.935483870967742
5846524,3,B00DPL32ME,"I found this a very tight and well done movie. The one flaw I would give this movie is to equate a vile serial killer with a DUI incident which led to loss of an innocent life. I don't blame a family member for feeling this way when they lose a loved one so senselessly, it's hard to control emotions.

5846530,5,B00DPL32ME,"I had hoped for just one thing:  that this movie would NOT glorify the persons involved, the crimes committed, nor the place where  they occurred. I wasn't disappointed, for it was not a ""glorified"" time in our city.  Rather, it was a lengthy span of too many months, seasoned with fairly regular, albeit minimal, media blurps that yet another girl had ""gone missing.""
  ""The Frozen Ground"" has captured the ambience of those sinister times when we learned to question who we knew and where and how they were spending their time away from the comforts of home and hearth. Amongst ourselves, we spoke in near whispers about common friends with quirky personalities, as we waited for the next ""announcement"" of a body found, or of a dancer who didn't show up for work.
  For all of its horrors, this is a grim and quiet film -- the story of a quiet investigation of a quiet businessman with a terrifying secret life. Alaska's magnificent wilderness plays an honest role, too:  cold, dark, menacing, where it's easy to disappear, where life is reduced to its lowest terms and survival will always reign supreme, where Hansen's prey didn't stand a chance.
  And it's accurate.  That really IS downtown Anchorage, and that IS the Knik River Bridge. It's the real Flattop Mountain in the foreground of the nighttime view of Anchorage.  And, yes, that IS the Alaska State Trooper building. There really WAS a ""Wild Cherry"" nightclub (and a couple of dozen more, just like it), the dancers were topless (and usually bottomless), and those ARE real photos of Hansen's victims hanging on the Troopers wall.
  More could have been told of Hansen's earlier life, but simply wasn't.  John Cusack is positively superb in the role, and Nicholas Cage is brilliant as the committed and caring cop who insists that all of the puzzle pieces are in plain view from the start.

I was a newsman in Anchorage when these crimes, and this serial killer were in the news, and the suspense in the movie matched the tension all of Anchorage felt.

I especially appreciated director Scott Walker's tight control that helped make this a solid thriller plot that came in at just 1 hour, 45 minutes.

Nicolas Cage puts in one of his best performances as the detective who helped bring him to justice. The mean streets of the early 1980's downtown Anchorage ALaska is well depicted here. Alaska had a horrible crime rate during the pipeline era and it still has problems.  John Cusack is outstanding as the serial killer hanson in this one. And the rest of the cast does  a fine job in this one as well.  The film is often at night and dark, and it is dark in Anchorage  in the fall in Anchorage.  This seems to have been filmed in Anchorage and that's a plus for realism as well. I don't understand why anyone but a videogame idiot would say this is boring , because there isn't explosions and violence?  and the detective is working
 against time to stop the killer or he may get away for good. And the young prostitute runaway is being hunted by both  Hanson and a hired killer.  Which leads to the death of a pimp as well. It was very suspenseful and everyone involved should be proud of this movie.  This looks good in HD but it's a dark movie and it's shot in a dark place.",1377993600,,1234,4.271551724137931
5846543,5,B00DPL32ME,"This film takes place in cold conservative Alaska where there is no crime and everyone has a job because they all own guns...and something about the oil companies.

After prostitute Cindy Paulson (Vanessa Hudgens) escapes from Hansen, the cases of unsolved crimes are given to Jack Holcolme (Nicolas Cage) the only cop in America who has trouble getting a warrant.

This is not a who-dun-it, but rather the story leading up to the arrest of Robert Hansen. It gives you glimpses of Anchorage's red light district filled with pimps, prostitutes, strippers, drug dealers, and a moose. This is a gritty tale. 5 stars for those who enjoy true crime stories.

Parental Guide: F-bombs, stripper nudity. The film deals with rape, but does not show it.  Limited amounts of blood, relatively tame on the graphics. It is not an exploitation style film.",1377993600,149,969,4.932515337423313

5846554,5,B00DPL32ME,"For the life of me I don't know why this film did not have major release. It captures Alaska and it captured the twists and turns of this case that frightened us throughout this time period. We knew there was a killer out there, but who? I was living in the bush and received my newspapers to find yet another body had been discovered. I am a hunter and was highly disturbed when I found out what Hanson had done. I am so glad to see a film of this quality has been made on this story.

 The acting in this is superb. I knew Cage would pull it off but darling Cusack of Llyod Dobbler, SAY ANYTHING fame? One look at his face in those glasses and I was owned by his portrayal of Robert Hanson, the Butcher/Baker Killer. HE frightened me from the get-- he WAS Robert Hansen. The music is perfect, so much so that you may miss some of it as ambiance when you are pulled into the gray days of winter and the sordidness of downtown Anchorage that is very, very real; much like many other cities that offer no solution for human degradation.  The story is so real, only someone who has studied the case can know exactly what is fiction. Every element fits so well together. It is amazing to look back and see how a crime like this was solved. Although the film shows Anchorage Police Department (APD) as being sexist and culturally biased, and unwilling to take the case which I am not sure is true-- with the State Troopers as being the persistent trackers of this case, the blame has a universal appeal in that it has been this very attitude of dismissing the deaths of social underworld inhabitants that has allowed killers to go undetected. And it is an attitude worth looking at. Many people responded in the newspaper comments feeling that these deaths were the work of someone just ""taking out the trash,"" one reason I think Hanson thought he would get away with it, and he might have had it not been for criminal justice persistence. We know so much more about criminal profiling now and have so many more tools for investigation and crime solving. Police Departments are so much more advanced now.

This story was woven so well and I am thankful it was written, bringing attention to how stressful violence can make life for the whole community. As a society we have now totally re-thought the nature of a murderous criminal; not so easily defined and this case contributed to that knowledge. We now know pillars of the community can be violent criminals. Robert Hanson proved that and Cusack nailed it to the screen. Brilliant film.",1377388800,,2536,4.482683982683983

5846556,4,B00DPL32ME,"As an Alaskan who remembers the case in the late 70's and 80's, I was excited to find out that they were making the movie and filming it in Anchorage.  I loved the way Hollywood tried to capture the look of Anchorage during that time.  I enjoyed the movie and give kudoss to Nic Cage, John Cusack, and Vanessa Hudgens.  The movie will find a place in the hearts of Alaskans (we are always excited when Hollywood gets it partially correct on screen).  The movie was not the greatest, but it was entertaining.  it could have dipped more into the life and history of Hansen so the audience could understand the madness behind the man.  John Cusack captured Hansen's creepiness. Just walking into Hansen's Bakery in Anchorage and seeing him in the store behind the counter gave me the creeps back then. You wanted to get your items and get out there quickly. John did a great job with his portrayal of Hansen.

The movie is about the capture of Robert Hansen, a baker in Anchorage, Alaska in the 70's and early 80's who committed a series of murders against young women.  He has also an avid hunter. He picked up, raped, and murdered prostitutes in Anchorage.  He would then chain them up, torture them in his basement, and then fly them out in his plane, murder like a hunter trying to hunt prey, and bury them in remote hunting areas in Alaska.  The story focuses on the investigation of the Alaska State Troopers to bring about a case with evidence against Hansen.  He had one surviving victim (Vanessa Hudgen's character) who was lucky to escape and help the Trooper convict Hansen.

The movie intrigued me for a number of reasons - true crime, drama, and John Cusack playing a character other than, well, John Cusack.  Don't get me wrong, I love the heck out of a socially awkward, passionate about music, good looking & articulate guy as much as everyone, but I was interested in seeing him portray a different sort of character.  He does so well, the average guy next door with twisted desires and dark secrets, pushed to the edge of discovery by Nicholas Cage, playing - well, not Nicholas Cage.  You know, the somewhat over the top slightly kooky guy?  Not this time.  It's a nice role reversal on the good guy/bad guy dynamic that they had in Con Air (which I'll need to watch again soon) with both parts played quite convincingly and realistically.

The theme and the setting of the movie is dark, a pallor cast over it from early on that makes you want to see if your monitor or TV has changed settings while you weren't paying attention.  The action mainly comes in the form of suspense, with some difficult scenes and little humor to break the mood, or even worse, mock the truth behind the tale.

Given that this is based on a true story, I felt it was written, scripted, and acted out with respect for what happened, and for the victims and their families.
