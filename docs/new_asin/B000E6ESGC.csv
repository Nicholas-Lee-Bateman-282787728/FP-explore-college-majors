8106481,2,B000E6ESGC,"Very poor picture quality, almost looked like a copy someone made off a cell phone. Sound was off as well.",1395360000,,106,4.35
8106482,3,B000E6ESGC,"Unfortunately, a few of the movies are in poor condition - Sarabande (terrible lighting, very washed out, faded look to it) and Lady Hamilton (freezes in spots about the middle of the film).
However, the two I bought it for ""The Wives Of Henry VIII"" and ""Fire Over England"" are in great shape and worth the price of the collection.
 ""Sins of Rome"" is another re-telling of the Spartacus tale and was much better than I expected.
Overall, ""History at the Movies"" is the bargain the other reviewers claim it is and I wasn't sorry I made this purchase.",1235433600,2,549,4.545454545454546
8106483,3,B000E6ESGC,"Overall, good fun. The visual quality is just okay, though with such old films that might be expected. The choice of films varies from high quality to old Saturday matinee. That said, still glad I bought it, particularly for the opportunity to see Stewart Granger in Sarabande for Lost Lovers, and Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh in Mrs. Hamilton. Keith Mitchell's performance in Henry the VIII and His Six Wives is worth the price of the three-disk set in itself. For true old British movie buffs there's George Arliss in The Iron Duke.",1219104000,,539,4.806451612903226
8106484,4,B000E6ESGC,"I bought this DVD for one reason only: ""Sarabande for Dead Lovers,"" which I saw as a kid at least 12 times. Unfortunately, it is not available elsewhere, in its pristine beauty. Despite the dreadful deterioration of the print, ""Sarabande"" is still revealed as a splendid historical J. Arthur Rank epic.  Based upon A.E.W. Mason's historical novel, ""Koenigsmark"", ""Sarabande"" concerns the tragic life of Sofia Dorothea of Celle (the silken-voiced and beautiful red-haired Joan Greenwood), who is locked in a loveless marriage with the loutish and gross Elector of Hanover, Georg Louis, who becomes George I, of England, but not before he locks his unloved wife in a tower for life. The reason? Her love affair with Philip Christopher von Koenigsmark (Stewart Granger at his most suavelicious!). Their tragic affair is thwarted by the aging once-beautiful red-haired Countess Clara von Platen (Flora Robson--the Helen Mirren of her day), abetted by a sinister Anthony Quayle. Completing the cast is the outstanding French actress, Franoise Rosay, as the Electress of Hanover, who has renounced all emotion in the name of  Royal Obligation.

It is such a shame that this film was not rescued before it disintegrated. The performances of the cast speak for themselves, but, unfortunately, one has to intuit the glorious color of the costumes and the richness of the settings in their lost magnificence.",1213228800,13,1398,5.232142857142857
8106485,4,B000E6ESGC,"This compilation is excellent value. The Six Wives of Henry V111 itself is well worth the price but their are other first rate movies. Many are in black and white but this often adds to the charm and gives them a more authentic feel i.e. they look as if they were filmed at the time they took place! One note that struck me was the performance of Laurence Olivier in Fire over England, absolutely terrible! Talk about hamming it up! By comparision any of Errol Flynn's performances in similar roles e.g. The Sea Hawk show that for sheer screen charisma he leaves Olivier far behind. This DVD is enjoyable and watchable, highly recommended.",1209859200,2,639,4.663716814159292
8106486,3,B000E6ESGC,"This compilation has some excellent films, like the Henry VIII, Scott of the Antartic, Saraband for Dead Lovers(This last unfortunately in rather poor quality)Others are not as good, but none of them is a complete turkey, and all have some interest for historical film buffs, and at this price it is a real bargain. You won't regret it.",1209772800,,336,4.810344827586207
8106487,4,B000E6ESGC,"I've purchased several DVD box sets from St. Clair. Most have been free of glaring defects. There was a problem however with one disc that refused to play two hour-length movies encoded on it. More prevalent (and somewhat annoying) is electronic distortion (pixillation) on dark scenes. No complaints about audio quality. Video condition is variable according to film used-- there's no evidence of digital restoration.

HISTORY AT THE MOVIES should definitely please any historically-minded Anglophile. The majority of these lesser-known films are British-made and deal with English and European history. The most modern of course is ""Scott.."" which recounts the events of that tragic 1912 South Pole expedition. The other British films are costume drama/adventure stories. The set is rounded out by two Roman Empire spectaculars and the soft-porn Euro-made ""Lady Hamilton.""
