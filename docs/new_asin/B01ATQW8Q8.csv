The reason given by a local merchant is,  ""Japan made products that cannot be played on our VCR, and the company is no longer in business.",1534118400,,243,4.260869565217392
8748443,5,B01ATQW8Q8,"I first saw this series on Masterpiece Theater in 1989-90, and became an instant fan for its tender and bittersweet story. I too have been searching for a long, long time for a DVD copy. I even wrote to BBC asking them to make this series available, and they did it!!!
But sadly my search goes on. It's only fair to make this available in Region 1. Please, make it available in REGION 1 so that we in the US can also enjoy this quality drama from BBC again!!!!!",1531526400,2,461,4.191011235955056

8748448,5,B01ATQW8Q8,"I was a teenager when I first saw The Ginger Tree, on American television's Masterpiece Theatre in 1990. I was a Japanophile who was enthralled by the story of a young woman's odyssey in the Far East, and in the years since have continued to carry the story in my heart. I had the presence of mind to record the episodes, which would prove VERY fortuitous in the ensuing years, as I (and many others) waited...and waited..and waited some more for an official video release that never came. Until now.

In 1903, a young Scotswoman, Mary Mackenzie, sets out to join her fiance Richard, a military officer who is posted in Manchuria. Vibrant and full of youthful hope, she quickly finds herself disappointed by her husband's coldness, and frustrated by the isolation he imposes upon her. Often left to her own devices among the expatriate community, she finds herself drawn to Count Kentaro Kurihama, a handsome, aristocratic Japanese diplomat, and the two begin a passionate affair, the consequences of which land Mary in Japan at a time of great change. From there she struggles to make a place for herself in her new country's often impenetrable society, with a culture and customs so unlike anything she has ever known...until World War II interrupts that journey, as it did for so many others.

The Ginger Tree is splendidly acted, with Samantha Bond carrying the whole thing on her very capable shoulders (she appears in nearly every scene). I have read that Oswald Wynd, author of the novel upon which The Ginger Tree is based, didn't care for this adaptation. Having read the excellent novel, I can see why, yet I feel Christopher Hampton's changes really work, making the story more emotionally accessible, even if it comes at the expense of narrowing down some of Wynd's panoramic historical sweep. The result is truly poignant and compelling.

It seems churlish to nitpick such a windfall...but I was a bit disappointed that the series is presented here in 4:3 pan and scan aspect ratio. It's crying out for letterboxing. And while I'm very grateful for the inclusion of English-language subtitles (too often left out of these sorts of dvd releases), I wish the subtitles weren't white  they are very hard to make out in lighter scenes. But those are minor complaints. There are no extras, which is unfortunate  The Ginger Tree occupies a unique place in TV history, as it was the very first HD program ever produced, as a joint production of the BBC and Japan's NHK. For anyone interested in a behind the scenes look at the series, I recommend seeking out Christopher Hampton's published screenplay, which contains a lengthy, very entertaining diary of his experience working on the series.

Thank you, Simply Media, for making this gem of a mini-series available at last. Twenty-five years after I first saw it, I'm thrilled to be able to own a 'real' copy at last, and hope that many new fans will now discover this haunting, unforgettable story.",1487548800,5,2957,4.857142857142857
8748449,5,B01ATQW8Q8,"I loved this when I first watched it on Masterpiece Theatre years ago and I fell in love with it again as I watched it over the Christmas holiday.  As always reading the book brings one so much closer to the characters but in this case I have to say the film was just as moving, touching, tragic and romantic. It was hard to come by but worth every penny and the wait.",1483401600,6,368,4.041095890410959
