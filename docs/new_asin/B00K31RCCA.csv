6401819,5,B00K31RCCA,We love MAY....We can watch these two seasons episodes repeatedly...,1421366400,,68,5.9
6401820,5,B00K31RCCA,Just as I remember from endless reruns. Most new couples should find the daily interactions of family members and starting ones own habitat comical through the writings of a young husband. I believe the story lines are based on one of the actor's own experience.,1421366400,,262,4.844444444444444
6401821,5,B00K31RCCA,Great TV show at a brilliant price. Came very quickly.,1421280000,,54,4.5

6401825,3,B00K31RCCA,"My favorite sitcom ever. Let's just get that out of the way. This show is amazing and you need to watch it. It holds up just as well as the other great sitcoms in the 90's, Seinfeld and Friends.

The problem is this dvd set. Seasons 1 & 2 are spread over 4 cds, with about 13 episodes on each disc. The video quality suffers, and is pretty not-so-good. Not only that, but it comes in a small plastic dvd case with all four cds stacked on top of each other in one ring. Not only is it a pain to get a discs out (since you have to take discs 1-3 out before you can get to 4) but it's obvious these disks are going to become very scratched over time.

This all actually improves on the previously released season 1 set (by Sony I think?) which was also on 2 cds, however the episodes are actually in the correct order in this one and there is a play-all episodes selection (where previously you had to pick each one). But this show deserves so much better.

Buy it so they'll release season 3 (which is now $60 on amazon for a set), but ugh, this set left me feeling sour.",1408665600,16,1069,4.056872037914692

6401854,5,B00K31RCCA,"One of the best shows ever on TV (first few seasons only, the rest sucked) up there with Seinfeld and Friends.

Can someone who owns this 2-pack version please tell me if contains the ORIGINAL, unmodified New York City skyline title sequence (with the Twin Towers)?  I was very sad to see this removed from the earlier DVD's I bought for seasons 1-5, and have been waiting to re-buy once the original credits were properly restored as we all remembered them.  Film / television is art and it's a crime to mess with history like this.

(Sorry to post this as a review, but for some reason I don't see ""Ask a question"" available for this product.)",1452643200,,645,4.487179487179487

6401856,5,B00K31RCCA,Bought as a Christmas gift haven't seen them but I am trusting they are great. I love this sitcom.,1444867200,,98,4.2105263157894735
6401857,5,B00K31RCCA,I love this show. I never bought this duo pack because I already have the seasons 1-5 when it was first released. I cannot tell you how the packaging is on here but I can say it is worth it. One of my favorite episodes is when Paul wanted to surprise Jamie where they are going for their anniversary but she got lost in the shuffle getting on the subway and couldn't hear where to meet him. This is way before everyone had a cell phone so no one can do comedy like this anymore. It is a treasure.,1444262400,,496,4.02020202020202

6401859,1,B00K31RCCA,The dvds skip and freeze. I've ordered many shows from amazon and I'm isually happy with them. But this one is so bad that ypu can't watch it. Very disappointing,1442275200,2,161,4.4

6401864,1,B00K31RCCA,Thought is was Jamie Lee Curtis and Richard Lewis comedy series from back then. It's called Anything But Love and is far better than this series in my opinion.,1433721600,,159,4.517241379310345
6401865,5,B00K31RCCA,Wish there were more programs like this on tv.,1433030400,,46,4.222222222222222
6401876,5,B00K31RCCA,"To some extent, this sitcom was to me as a newlywed what The Honeymooners were to my parents when they were barely married. I've always loved this show and was so happy when it was finally released on DVD. There something wonderful about so many 90s comedies - now seemingly forgotten or unappreciated by many - that offered a more wholesome, less crassly vulgar and uncouth comedy that many of today's offerings. Mad About You is so well cast and has so many funny moments - if you haven't seen it, give it a chance!",1432684800,2,517,4.4526315789473685
6401877,5,B00K31RCCA,"One of my favorite couples. So glad I have this multi disc 2 season set.
Packaging is simple, 2 discs in one case, resting atop each. Have to be careful to not scratch these gems!
Season 3 is the only season not available for purchase. It needs to be released!",1428105600,,260,4.22
6401878,4,B00K31RCCA,This was a good show and still is after all these years.,1427932800,,56,3.75
6401879,5,B00K31RCCA,good set of DVD's. Looks fine on HD Television. Inexpensive price for quality of DVD's.,1427155200,,87,4.866666666666666
6401880,3,B00K31RCCA,An OK series. The DVDs in great shape.,1426204800,,38,3.875
6401881,5,B00K31RCCA,One of the best sitcoms out there!! The chemistry between Helen Hunt and Paul Reiser is over the top. I watched this series when it was on TV and am sooooo delighted to have it in my home DVD library. The entire cast is great and I love all the fabulous interactions between them. I watch them over and over again. They always lift my spirits!!,1426118400,,344,4.2272727272727275
6401882,5,B00K31RCCA,This show was one of the BEST comedy series ever! I could hardly wait for Thursday night to get here so I could see how the Murry was doing. Paul and Helen played off each other so well that you really thought they were a newly married couple. I am looking forward to getting more of the seasons to watch. I recommend this DVD to anyone looking for good split your sides laughing comedy.,1425340800,,387,4.243243243243243
6401883,5,B00K31RCCA,Great writing.  Well acted.  It rises above Reiser's comic routine foundation (which is great) so that the viewer cares about the main characters.  Great date show.,1424476800,,164,5.230769230769231
6401884,1,B00K31RCCA,"Love the show, hate the packaging. Discs were tightly-packed onto the spindle in the case, with the bottom disc 4 of 4 cracked all the way across. It was a gift and opened too late for us to notice before Amazon's return window expired.",1423526400,5,236,4.386363636363637

8655557,3,B00K31RCCA,"The leads (Paul Reiser and Helen Hunt) have always been very likable stars, but in my opinion, the problem with this show was always that ALL the actors (the main and supporting cast) were more suited to be supporting actors (bridesmaids, if you will), whether it be in a TV sitcom or theatrical movie.  I am aware of Hunt's many Emmy wins for ""Mad About You"" during its generally successful run, as well as an Oscar for Best Actress (""As Good As It Gets""), all extremely praiseworthy, but realistically, even with all those accolades, she seemingly wasn't meant to carry a TV show or movie.  Moreover, I liked Reiser's ""My Two Dads"" from the '80s (co-starring Greg Evigan), but it was never a ratings success.  The same can be said for the ratings for ""Mad About You,"" with its highest year-end ratings being #11 and another season being #24.  Otherwise, it did not crack the Top 25 for year-end ratings in its 7 seasons; in fact, it ended its run ranking #85 (making one wonder why they've announced an upcoming revival of the series).  I mean, I think it would be rare for someone to pay a full ticket price for a movie with one of these actors as the main lead, compared to, say, the cast of ""Will and Grace,"" where probably any of the four leads could carry their own TV show or movie (since all four of them won Emmys for W&G).  And how many people on the street today under 40 years old could name their 5 favorite episodes of ""Mad About You""?  Heck, they probably couldn't name three.",1527292800,,1492,4.443223443223443
8655558,3,B00K31RCCA,I remember this being a lot funnier back in the 90's!  And the old dvd format doesn't look right on today's wider screens.  Everyone looks really chubby!,1517788800,,153,4.62962962962963
