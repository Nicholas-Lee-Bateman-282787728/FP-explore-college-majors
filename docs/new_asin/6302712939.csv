7829478,5,6302712939,"This hard-to-find item was exactly as described with both tapes included for the complete opera, as represented.  I am very happy with the quality of the product and the speed with which I received it.",1403395200,,201,4.742857142857143
7829479,1,6302712939,"It's been about eighteen years since I first viewed and listened to John Corigliano's opera, The Ghosts of Versailles.  I was hoping I would have a better understanding or appreciation of it.  All I can say is that, in this piece, Corigliano demonstrated that he could write in many modes and styles. Forget about the overwrought libretto. So, anyway, now that we know he has these talents, we're still waiting for him the write a real opera.",1248134400,2,442,4.7272727272727275
7829480,5,6302712939,"I purchased the video on laser disc when it first came out and I have worn it out listening to it.  I'd love to have a DVD of the work, and additionally a CD to listen to in the car.  Alas neither appear to be available.  You'll love the interplay between the modern and opera within the opera, as noted above.  I saw the production at both the Met and the Lyric Opera in Chicago.  It is a superb new work.",1111881600,11,406,3.962962962962963
7829481,1,6302712939,"In 1991, when I heard the Met had commissioned a new opera, my interest was raised.  Over the course of rehearsals, I managed to find news of this new project and grew more and more excited.  Then the fateful day came for the premiere, and what a premiere it was!

Corgliano and Hoffman truly bring forward through the music and text the boredom of the ghosts at the opening.  In fact, I still can't believe anyone has actually sat through the opening without being so bored as to be in physical pain!  And it was all downhill from there.

One highlight, though, is the setting of Le Mere Coupable, which is an overlooked highlight in Beaumarchais's career (along with being responsible for the Americans winning the War of Independence).  It is good someone has finally set this, but did it have to be the centerpiece of this garbage?  Where is has opera gone?  One can find very good results in late-20th Century Opera (look at Streetcar Named Desire), but one won't find good recent opera at the Met, it seems.

Now the performance...

These are all excellent singers, but the performance of this opera does put forward the only thing I have not liked about opera in English.  These people can sing Italian, Latin, German!  Some can even sing Hebrew and Greek!  And one can understand the words!  Why can't opera singers enunciate when they are singing in English?  The stream of vowels without even the hint of consonants only detracts from a performance.",1104796800,8,1459,4.68503937007874
7829482,5,6302712939,"On December 19th, 1991, The Ghosts of Versailles premiered at the Metropolitan Opera in NYC. This opera was comissioned for the Met's Cententenary and was the first new work performed there in over a quarter  of a century. See what you missed. Superbly conducted by James Levine, this  opera features Theresa Stratas as the dead and depressed Marie Antoinette  and has a hillarious cameo by Marilyn Horne as an arabian songstress whose  voice is the purest in the land. The brilliant plot involves the characters  of Beaumarchais's Figaro plays, led by the ghost of Beaumarchais himself.  Will Beaumarchais' follies warm and win over the heart of a dead and  depressed Marie Antoinette? Will Louis the XVI lose his wife to the dead  playwright? I'm not telling so you'll have to get it and see. A great  introduction for those not into opera (since it is sung in English), and  enjoyable enough to make even the stiffest operaphille smile.",920419200,28,939,4.886075949367089
