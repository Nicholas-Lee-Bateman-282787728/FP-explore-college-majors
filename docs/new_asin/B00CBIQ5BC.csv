8579855,3,B00CBIQ5BC,Generally good but too much talking. Makes it less relaxing than expected. Probably more geared towards beginners. Still using it though.,1385424000,,137,5.571428571428571
8579856,5,B00CBIQ5BC,"Of all the yoga DVD's I own, this has moved its way to the top. I stumbled upon this DVD reading an article from MindBodyGreen. Hope's instructions are spot on -- I really do feel like I am a student in her class. She has really good instructions about form. I noticed that I didn't need to look at her the whole time while I was following along.

The DVD is broken down into 3 segments so you can either do them separately or choose the last option that plays them all together which it still plays in segments, you just don't need your remote to hit next. I would have liked an option to have played the entire class without any short pauses in between segments. Overall, this DVD is great and I have noticed I am more mindful with my posture during yoga class!",1372118400,4,763,4.226027397260274
8579857,5,B00CBIQ5BC,"This is one of the best yoga and fitness DVD's that I own (and I own at least 60 fitness DVD's). The instruction is great, includes suggestions for using props when appropriate,and has the inspiration that I find in a yoga class at the studio. Hope is an excellent yoga instructor--when I can't make it to her studio for class, this is the next best option!",1367107200,2,357,4.424242424242424
