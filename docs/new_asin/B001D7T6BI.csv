3526521,5,B001D7T6BI,The only improvement could be that they would release on Blu Ray. Gregory Peck is at his finest! Great characters to both love and hate.,1361145600,3,136,4.48

8292076,3,B001D7T6BI,GERONIMO WAS AN OUTSTANDING WESTERN AND RATED FIVE STARS.  HOWEVER ITS COMPANION OLD GRINGO WAS A DISAPPOINTMENT  AND I WOULD NEVER HAVE ORDERED IT IF IT HAD NOT BEEN INCLUDED WITH GERONOMO IN A TWO-PACK.,1443916800,,204,4.8
8292077,4,B001D7T6BI,"Bought this combo for ""Old Gringo"" because I love Gregory Peck and Jimmy Smits and yes, Jane Fonda played a great role too. The story line was compelling and invited you to take a vested interest in each of the main characters. I had watched it numerous times on Encore so I decided to finally buy it and watch it in a much better resolution. So glad I did!",1430524800,,357,4.188405797101449
