Anyone who has read Evelyn Waugh's ""Decline and Fall"" will recall the passage, near the end, where the promising young German architect Otto Silenus holds forth on the difference between the static and the dynamic.  A good thing to think on when you're watching ""Le Pont des Arts"" (the title, being a place name, is in fact untranslatable); what we've been given here is a succession of beautiful stills.  Eugne Green (the second I-hate-America Virginian Green in Paris that I can think of - remember Julien, but there's apparently no blood relationship) has given us just that - he loves pictorial beauty, and all of his four young protagonists are too beautiful for words; and he sort of increases the stasis by having the main speeches addressed to the camera, as if it were an interloper between speaker and listener.  That's what can be off-putting.

That, and a very minority demurrer I've heard: ""isn't the film homophobic?""  Well - uh - I never thought of it that way.  It's true that Green landed Denis Podalyds, one of the leading French actors after all, to play the unnameable music director; and Podalyds specializes in bitchy-old-queen parts (sorry, PC folk), and he has to have a social circle.  It looks as if a Belgian agent landed Green with a package deal, ""you can only have Natacha Rgnier if you also take Jrmie Renier and Olivier Gourmet;"" okay, both Renier and Gourmet have earned their spurs in France, and Renier does fine as a rather sinister young bisexual, Gourmet as a high-camp deputy minister.  Find yourself a garden-variety male prostitute and an effeminate civil servant - and you have your gay cnacle.  Homophobia?  Nope.  Just background.

Main plot is a little feeble.  Two protagonists, both suicidal; their rather more feet-on-the-ground lovers; and lots of chat.  The beautiful, the gorgeous, the amazing Natacha Rgnier is wonderful as the maltreated soprano; so is Adrien Michaux as a rather un-motivated postgraduate student; but even they can't make the film take off into the empyrean.  Enjoy the close-ups and the dialogue addressed right at you, enjoy the long shots of Paris, enjoy Monteverdi; none will bring ""Le Pont des Arts"" fully to life, but the camera work is memorable.  MEMORABLE.",1188000000,,2302,4.950520833333333
