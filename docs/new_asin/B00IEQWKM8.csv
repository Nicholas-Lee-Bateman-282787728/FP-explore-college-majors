6261285,2,B00IEQWKM8,Ladies in Lavender is fantastic but the other two were very disappointing.  They became rather seedy and we didn't finish watching.  I would highly recommend just getting Ladies in Lavender.  I'd give that a 5 star rating.,1468454400,,222,4.945945945945946
6261286,1,B00IEQWKM8,We were very disappointed in the vulgarity of Quartet/Gosford Park; we expected better writing from Julian Fellows - we would never recommend any of these movies and would like to have our money reimbursed.  It was so upsetting because we had high hopes in seeing something comparable to Downton Abbey.  Can we get our money back?  Thank you  Bessie Moustakas,1466812800,4,359,4.933333333333334

8641650,4,B00IEQWKM8,"I really liked Quartet and Ladies in Lavender, very good movies, but Gosford Park was one of the most boring movies I have seen in a long time. Too many characters to remember who was who and not enough excitement. Slow moving. I thought it would never end.",1519776000,,257,4.375
8641651,2,B00IEQWKM8,"Well, Gosford Park was just ""ok"".  I watched a few minutes of ""Quartet"" but that one was vulgar...I mean the language was very offensive to me so i donated this to the library.  Gosford Park was just ""so-so"", wouldn't want to watch it again. As for the 3rd movie...had no interest at all in watching it.",1502928000,,303,4.392857142857143
