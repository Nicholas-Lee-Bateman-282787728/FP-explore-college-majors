8005722,3,B00012T256,"I've had this DVD for 7 years now. This Anime DVD is called The Twelve Kingdoms, it has episodes 40 to 42 in Japanese ONLY. Personally I was bored by the first time I watched this anime on my region free DVD player, but when I bought it brand new it came with a transparent collectible card. Back then I just wasn't accustomed to The Twelve Kingdoms yet.",1432684800,,354,4.220588235294118
