8605860,2,B00EJ2BDYM,"Enough has been said about how bad some of these Fox prints are and this one is not great.  Most important is a really good cast is wasted in a choppy, poorly directed version of what could be a great fantasy story.  June Haver probably comes across best as the waitress in search of a better life, but the rest of the cast is pretty stiff and lines are delivered almost paused waiting for a camera angle change at a bunch of times.  Maybe it is poor editing to blame but aside from the great ""Simple Life"" song, the movie just doesn't live up to its potential.",1398038400,7,561,4.224299065420561

8605862,5,B00EJ2BDYM,"This film was re-made, probably during a writer's strike, as an episode of ""Gavilan"" with Robert Urich. While it never attained the ethereal majesty of Nathan's PORTRAIT OF JENNIE on the screen and cannot compete with THE BISHOP'S WIFE, it is none the less a strange and ""Enchanted Voyage."" THE SWIMMER  can be considered a re-make of this film. With it's downbeat ending, the Lancaster film displays the cynical gulf that separates two films in twenty years. It is about the lure of water and what happens to the mind when it is absent, among so many other things. It required a special score; what it got was someone who aimed it at a brick wall and put an anvil on the gas pedal. There is a strange time displacement in this film, which ensures that it is a fantasy. But I will let you discover that, and Robert Nathan, on your own.",1384819200,,835,4.457516339869281
8605863,3,B00EJ2BDYM,"This is the film that introduced the standard, ""Give Me the Simple Life"", a song that's been used to sell everything from Campbell's soup to cars. In fact, ""Give Me the Simple Life"" was the original name for this movie. I have sheet music from the film that lists that as it's title.

I'm a big fan of John Payne and so his version of this song at the beginning of the film is a special treat. Other than that, this film is an odd mish-mash of story lines that go no where, characters whose stories don't pan out and one particular song that really doesn't make any sense (""We're Off to See the Wizard"" from the Wizard of Oz!). John Payne was considerably too old to play the brother of a 10 year old (he was 34 at the time). John Ireland's character is too out of place to serve much purpose in the story. Also, there is nothing in the early part of the story that would indicate that Charlotte Greenwood's landlady character has any feelings towards Mr Peckett (other than being his landlady).

Another confusing part concerns where this is supposed to be located. The town is called Pinedale and they say that they are 300 miles from any ocean. Mr. Peckett gets letters addressed to Maine but, when they go on their journey in the boat, they wind up someplace that has Spanish moss (which only grows in places like south Georgia and Florida).

Spoiler alert: John Payne only appears in the first 15 minutes and the last 15 minutes of the film. I have read articles in which he has stated that he so disliked this film (and several other films Fox assigned him after his war service) that he asked for his release from his contract on a weekly basis. In those days, actors did what they were told and didn't have choices of roles. After the disappointment of his role in 'Wake Up and Dream"", he pushed very hard to be assigned to his most famous role, Mr. Gailey in ""Miracle on 34th Street"", which was his last film at Fox. After that, he was able to buy out his contract and go on to work freelance to other studios.

As with all of the films in the Fox Cinema Archives series, this DVD is strictly bare bones - no chapters, no trailers, no photos, no extras - just the movie.

The summary on the back is also incorrect. John Payne's character doesn't send his sister to live with Mr. Peckett and his landlady when he joins the Navy - he sends her to live with his cousin and she eventually runs away back to Mr. Peckett and his landlady. I swear, the people who write these summaries for the Cinema Archives series don't watch the movie prior to writing the jacket summary. It's not the first one I've seen that's incorrect.",1378944000,6,2628,4.366053169734151
