8620026,5,B00G1210QE,"As an avid life-long forager and wild food enthusiast with a wild food kitchen garden, I found this movie to be a one of a kind gem.  For safety reasons explained in this movie, I do not forage mushrooms. However, I do forage for and enjoy ramps, ""molly mouchers"" (morels the one mushroom exception), stinging nettles, and the like.

I wish there were more movies with story lines incorporating living knowledgeably off the land.  The cinematography of the numerous nature scenes was spectacular; the close-up shots and descriptions of the mushrooms, ramps, and trees instructive; while the storyline was both believable and engaging.  The forager, a consummate chef, was obviously at home preparing dishes in a high end kitchen as well as in the woods over a camp stove.

I particularly enjoyed the part where a wealthy woman hired the leading forager, as a chef, for a grande, impression garnering event.  I believe it was for around 60 guests so it was no small undertaking.  Anyway, they agreed on a price, but she took advantage of his kindness by continually adding more tasks to the agreed upon list without additional compensation.  I would have liked to see the outcome of the event  as per how he handled the situation.  The movie did not include this but left it up to our imaginations.  I would have like to see her working in the kitchen and pulling it off.

This movie was a not so happily ever after love story about two people experiencing asynchronous life paths.  This movie was a real treat from beginning to end.

If you enjoyed this movie, you may like the book, The Mushroom Hunters.  It takes place on the West Coast and instead of supplying restaurants in NYC, the hunters catered to cutting-edge, high-end, eateries in the Seattle area.",1424822400,,1761,4.765676567656766
8620027,5,B00G1210QE,"This indie film boldly proclaims nominations or awards from: 4 international film festivals, plus two thumbs up from Roger Ebert, and other comments like Top 25 of 2012.  Which self-acclimations lead to at least 3 thoughts already: Good thing Roger never lost that digit in some tragic accident, otherwise he wouldnt be able to give two thumbs up.  Second: perhaps I should start my very own international film festival.  After all, everyone else seems to have one.  Then I could get quoted and further spread my world-wide fame.  Third: Top 25 of 2012 is another way of saying that reviewer considered it the #25 film of 2012, which doesnt sound quite as impressive.  Anyhow, WILL YOU LIKE IT?  Well, it IS a quirky, but for me an enjoyable film to watch.

For a film with basically no violence, almost no swear words, a slow pace, a tight focus on two people, no sex or nudity and limited dialog, I found it surprisingly interesting.

I know, the title: NOW, FORAGER looks like it deserves an exclamation mark at the end, and that it ought to be a post-apocalyptic film.  Turns out it isn't post-apocalyptic at all, the title was adapted from a line by Walt Whitman in Blades of Grass, and it isn't really about foragersnot in the sense of people who survive solely by gathering food in the wild.  If they are foragers at all, they certainly are most sophisticated ones.  They could better be described as food connoisseurs who enjoy gathering fresh ingredients in the wild and selling them to restaurants in the city for a living.  By ingredients, most of all I mean mushrooms.  Also, other edible growing things.  Not that they are vegetarians.

At the heart of the movie is something common to almost all our lives today: an event or a situation which tests this couples relationship, perhaps to the breaking point.  Specifically: the guy wants to spend even more time gathering foodtraveling in fact, migrating like the geese or butterflies, in search of interesting foods to gather all year round.  The woman on the other hand is increasingly aware that they aren't getting any younger, they have no real savings, no health benefits, and shed like to get a little more stable jobwhich she does, as a starter cook in a small but good quality restaurant in New York City (the location they called home when they weren't on excursions in the country, gathering mushrooms).

But all generalities are portrayed in specifics, and its the specifics in this film which really give it charm.  Each mushroom Lucien finds is named: both its proper Latin name and its common name, plus a few interesting facts about it.  Each mushroom is shown close-up and in vivid color.  Many other bits of natural scenes are also shown close-up and lovingly: the face of a turtle, a salamander on wet ground, a small creek, trees, quail mother and babies.

Although the actor portraying Lucien generally moves slowly, in a few cooking scenes the hands portray the skill of an experienced cook: expertly and rapidly chopping vegetables, mushrooms and the like with big, sharp knives, uncomfortably close to the fingers of the other hand

There are a few bonuses in the DVD version.  First: English subtitles.  Often not found in low-budget films, but youd never understand those Latin names without the subtitles.  There are few special features; one of them is an actual recipe for a mushroom dish and shows how to make it.  Another recaps the huge variety of mushrooms seen in the film, again with both the Latin and common names, and even closer than in the film itself, in beautiful color (often showing them in two settings, to give more feel for variations in color and background).  This film is dedicated at the end to a couple with the dates of both their birth and death, so apparently the inspiration for the story was a real couple, making it more interesting.

<Mild spoiler alert> Theres a memorable, quietly sarcastic section in the middle of the film when Lucien has hard luck hunting mushrooms along the mid-east coast and ends up taking one catering assignment for a party arranged by the wife of a consultant at a think tank on Energy policy in Washington DC [another way of saying the husband is a well-paid lobbyist for the oil and gas industry].  The wife is one narcissistic b____.  Even the husband doesnt seem very interested in her; one gets the sense perhaps she is a trophy wife that he found he only enjoys showing off in public so long as he doesnt actually have to listen to her.and as Lucien drives back from DC toward NYC he passes by an oil refinery with its smoke stacks and storage tanks, the air emissions and stagnant ponds the total antithesis of the simple, beautiful natural landscape in which he loves to spend his time hunting wild edibles.
I found the film engaging from beginning to end.  I hope this will give the reader a sense of whether or not you would enjoy it.",1422576000,,4893,4.705399061032864
8620028,5,B00G1210QE,Really great small feature. Really focused drama that doesn't cop to relationship genre tropes. Very recognizable characters. Definitely worth watching.,1394496000,2,152,6.65
