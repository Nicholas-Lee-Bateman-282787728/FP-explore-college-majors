8082208,5,B000B66GS8,"My Grandfather was in the 1944 World Series with the Browns and I knew this would be a perfect gift for my Father who talks fondly of it.  Sadly, I never did see him in the video, but otherwise, it was a decent coverage of the game.  The way it's shown is more like highlights than an actual video of the full game.",1403395200,,315,3.984126984126984
