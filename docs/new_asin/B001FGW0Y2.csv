8302059,5,B001FGW0Y2,"This is the true story of Harald Edelstam the Swedish Ambassador to Chile. During the 1973 military coup against President Allende, the Cuban embassy was under fire by tanks and Cubans were returning fire from the windows; Edelstam took a Swedish flag in hand and walked in front of the tanks as bullets hurled past. He fetched the Cubans out of the embassy and took them to the Swedish embassy, then got them out of Chile to safety. Edelstam also helped many other Cubans to escape from Chile and was honored by Fidel Castro as a hero. Edelstam is played by a very convincing Michael Nyqvist in one of his best Movies ever.
I highly recommend this Movie both for the acting skills of Michael Nyqvist and for the Historical information.",1443916800,,736,4.625954198473282

8302061,5,B001FGW0Y2,"What can I say?  Michael Nyqvist is a genius in front of the camera and Kate del Castillo will just blow you away. This film is advertised as a love story based on a period of time in the life of the Swedish Ambassador to Chile, Harald Edelstam.  I don't know enough about Chile's history (1973), or Edelstam, to comment on the historical accuracy of the film, but the two main characters (Nyqvist and del Castillo), will keep you glued to the screen anyway with their intensely realistic portrayals of two people caught up in war.  They risk their lives and those of family members in an effort to protect refugees, and to do what they believe is right and just. The love story really is secondary to everything else they experience and survive.  No matter what angle you view this film from, you will most definitely be touched by all you see and hear.  Overall a really excellent film.",1302048000,6,888,4.525
