Ive read reviews of people trashing something for this or that and its come to them just not being in tune with what the product is. you cant please all the people all the time.. but this is not cool.. Im not so much talking about the material. Its definitely beginners stuff, so if youve been using cubase for any length of time, all youll get from this is a few tidbits here or there. the reason im so upset is because the editing and use of time on this, at least on the beginning three tutorials, is almost obscene. For example, there are soooo many times when they explain something how to move a clip around. Then they move a clip and you go, oh okay i see now.. then they spend the next 20 seconds in silence just moving clips around.. then they show you, okay so when you record something do this or that, and they start recording.. and keep recording and keep recording and keep recording and your sitting there watching it going.. okay i get it!!!! then they show you some midi tracks and how you can split it out for different parts.. you go, cool, thats preety neat.. then they press play and their midi song starts playing, and plays and plays and plays, and keeps playing, while you sit there staring at the screen going, uh i get it already, your playing a song.. and on and on, after they do this two or three times you cant help but get the feeling youve been completely ripped off. i don't know if they did this on purpose or if its just sloppy editing but either way its really annoying and counter productive to learning.. i cant tell you how many times after she stops talking everything just goes silent and your staring at the screen watching nothing while they wait 8 seconds to go to the next screen, just wasting your time.. as i said, my main problem isn't about the content, its the production.. lousy lousy lousy, almost painful to bear through it.. do yourself a favor and go with web tutorials or ask video..",1252540800,,2005,4.320954907161804
8155132,5,B000K8YNJQ,"For me this was a great combination.  I was new to Cubase, but I didn't want just to learn about the software.  I needed to figure out how to use it to create mixes of my music and how to master them.

The Quick Start section was a very complete overview of Cubase.  I probably could have gotten the same thing by reading the operations manual.  However, watching a video of somebody using the software and being able to follow along with it was a much better way to learn.

But what I thought was really good were the more detailed sections on audio and midi.  Those tutorials didn't just explain the software.  They showed me how to use it to do the types of things I wanted to do with my own music.  For example, the mixing tutorial creates a complete mix and discusses the right and wrong ways to use compression, eq, reverb, and so on.  Same thing for the mastering tutorial.  The midi section was really deep.  I figured out how to hook up my hardware synths, and also learned a lot about software synths.

The mixing and mastering DVD built on the basics that had been presented in the Cubase training.  This DVD is not specific to Cubase, but takes examples from Pro Tools, Sonar, Cubase, Sound Forge, and Audition.  I had read a couple of books on mixing and mastering before that talked about a lot of the same things.  But having read those, I felt like I really didn't know where to start if I actually had to do mixing or mastering.  This DVD is more of a cookbook approach.  For example, for eq it presents charts of how different instruments are affected by eq at different frequencies.  It also contains a lot of audio examples created with popular software effects plug-ins.  Hearing how some of tese effects actually sound means a lot more than just reading a discussion about it.

For my needs these two DVD's were money well spent.",1225929600,,1851,4.433234421364985
8155133,1,B000K8YNJQ,"I don't get the point of these DVDs.  The whole time I was watching them I felt like I was in a used car dealership and I kept waiting for the introduction of Cubase to get over and the test drive to start, but it never does.

Here's a hot tip for the producers of these DVDs.  We already bought Cubase 4, which is why we bought your DVDs.  Therefore, you don't have to waste our time and money trying to sell us on it.

What I was looking for was a DVD that started by showing me how to set up my recording gear, open Cubase, configure the inputs and outputs, and record Mary Had a Little Lamb, and finally play it back.  Then, they could have me add another track to the song so it played in the round, or something.  This type of instruction would continue on until we were mixing and doing all kinds of other cool stuff with Mary Had a Little Lamb.

Instead, what I got the same kind of guided tour of Cubase that I got when I visited the Statue of Liberty...  ""Here's the icon for Cubase, it was invented back in 2003, oh, and aren't the colors in Cubase aesthetically pleasing?  They'll make you more productive...""

What a waste.",1208822400,3,1136,4.165137614678899
8155134,1,B000K8YNJQ,"I will start off with the fact that I never complain about anything, but I have to let everyone know about this one because I can not get my money back for this waste of disk space. Beware! This is not a tutorial. It's just a brief overview of Cubase 4. There is nothing inspiring or helpful about this so called course. It's over very quickly. You will be better off just reading the manual as I did before I bought this so called tutorial. I could have put together a better one myself. As for the Mixing and Mastering I might be able to eat the cost for that one, but again not a course at all. They just run very quickly through the subjects and leave you wondering why you even bought these overviews. Their advertising is very deceptive. I wasted $60.00 on these so called courses and you will too if you buy this garbage!",1186012800,15,828,4.246835443037975
