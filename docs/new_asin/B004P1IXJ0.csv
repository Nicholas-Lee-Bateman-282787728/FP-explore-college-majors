4442043,4,B004P1IXJ0,"Just got back from seeing this movie in the movie theater. The critical reviews for the movie were bad, however I like true `B' movies, so I went in with an open mind.

The Story

I felt the story was very good, and it had a few twists and turns, nothing huge but if you allowed yourself to buy in to the world of the movie, they present some good ethical dilemmas that the characters have to deal with. Unlike many sword and sandal movies here you are never completely comfortable with who you are supposed to root for or what the correct moral viewpoint is. In the end, they explain things with a nice little twist that sets you up for a second viewing of the film.

Production Values

Honestly, the look of the film and the locations are top shelf. The much maligned CGI works serviceably throughout the film until the end, where it does fall short in presenting the malice and impact of the final villain. I enjoyed the look of the beginning of the film and the crusades, and the dark muddy look of Europe upon the characters return. The locations in the middle of the movie are magnificent and epic, sweepingly filmed with very good cinematography.

Music

The music it terrific and raises the entire level of the production. The music is epic, exciting, and some of the better I have heard.

Acting

The acting is good, there are a few awkward exchanged here and there but overall everyone does a fine job. The standout performance is that of the actress playing the imprisoned witch, her performance is layered, complex, malevolent, innocent, evil, honest, creepy, blameless, and any other acronym you want.

The Good

The opening is serviceable but I especially liked the battle montage that introduces the main characters. The movie moves along at a good pace. The bridge scene is as good as anything you will see in any adventure movie, it is the highlight action set piece in my opinion, and the setup before it and chase after it are great. This is the highlight of the film.

The Bad

As I mentioned there are a few awkward acting moments, and even though the end of the movie really goes for it, the CGI and voice acting for the final Villain show-down don't deliver as well as a $40M production should.",1295136000,24,2217,4.528822055137844
4442044,4,B004P1IXJ0,"Nicholas Cage may be the poster boy for advertising this new movie, but in my opinion, the main star is the actress that plays the possessed ""Witch"" that comes out shining. This new actress is a shining example of someone who can control her facial muscles with each developing scene that she plays. Look at how fast she can change her facial features like a chameleon as she pits one man after another throughout the second half of the movie. She must have been #1 in her Drama School!

I give this movie 4/5 stars for its passing entertainment value, not because of any relevance to history or reality. Aside from granting ""artistic license"" to the director and script-writers who didn't think much of accurate Church history to begin with, I find it hard to believe that even a disenfranchised Catholic knight tired of the Crusades could misunderstand why he had gone there in the first place and make jokes that seem to show that he was never a Confirmed Catholic to begin with, this knight (Nicholas Cage's character) probably didn't pass post-Confirmation studies.

As for the battlefield ""voice of the Church"", the so-called ""man of the cloth"" who clamors the Crusaders to kill in the name of Jesus, that's just plain laughable!  But misguided, modern people of today just love parroting these popular lies.
FYI, the Crusaders saved ancient Western civilization from the physical invasion of evil Islam. Too bad there are too many stupid people of today, including directors who would like to think otherwise. No time for soundbites here.

There was nothing secretive about the texts for exorcisms.
If the phony ""monks"" were playing with the ""Key of Solomon"", then they were never Catholics to begin with. But, of course, I understand this is just a Hollywood movie.

Here's the official, modern Catholic text for exorcism:

4442047,3,B004P1IXJ0,"What we have here is a bit of a contradiction: A historical drama that exposes the hypocrisy of the Church and a supernatural thriller that confirms the existence of evil demonic forces. This is clearly not a matter of what the filmmakers would have us believe, but even in terms of pure entertainment, I'm puzzled as to how anyone thought both messages could be sent in the same story. One can be taken seriously. The other cannot. ""Season of the Witch"" (which, incidentally, is not to be confused with the George A. Romero film of the same name) is initially caught in a tug-of-war between substance and spectacle, only for the latter to win and bring the whole thing down to the level of a dimestore possession tale. It hardly seems a fitting vehicle for Nicholas Cage - although, I must admit, his project choices have of late been less than memorable.

He plays a knight named Behmen. He and his friend, Felson (Ron Perlman), start off as loyal knights fighting in the Crusades; they mercilessly stab, slit, and maim in the belief that their enemies are an affront to God and his son, Jesus Christ. But after years of mindless battling, they realize that women and children are among the slaughtered, and they become disillusioned. Strange that it took them so long to realize who they were killing. They quit the army, are decreed as deserters, and live life as outcasts for some months before happening upon a town ravaged by the Black Plague - a dark, filthy place of wood and stone, where the faithful roam the streets flagellating themselves while robbed figures haul away rotting bodies on carriages. Watching this, I kept in mind that the men of Monty Python were able to make this kind of thing funny.

Behmen and Felson are caught and taken to the bedchamber of Cardinal D'Ambroise (a cameo by Christopher Lee), whose face has been monstrously disfigured by illness. He and his subjects have reason to believe a witch is the cause of this pestilence. They have her locked in a dungeon below, for, according to a priest named Debelzaq (Stephen Campbell Moore), she has already confessed to it and to making a pact with Lucifer. D'Ambroise wants Behmen and Felson to transport this suspected witch, known almost entirely as The Girl (Claire Foy), to a faraway monastery, where she will be judged by a group of monks. Behmen, who feels nothing but guilt over a woman he impaled with his sword, agrees. But only on the condition that she be given a fair trial. Amazing how a man so cynical can also be so nave.

If they hope to reach this monastery, they will need someone intimately familiar with the land, for the journey is long and uncharted. Here enters a swindler named Hagamar (Stephen Graham), first seen with his head and hands sticking out of pillory. Also tagging along is Eckhardt, a grief-stricken father and widower (Ulrich Thomsen), and Kay (Robert Sheehan), a boy who wants to prove his bravery and become a knight. As they transport The Girl over perilous peaks, across a rickety bridge, and through a haunted forest populated by demonic wolves, Behmen begins to suspect that she's as evil as Debelzaq claims she is. How is it she has the strength of a man four, nay, five times her size? How does she know details about things she could have no knowledge of? Why does absolutely nothing surprise her? And why are people ending up dead?

One of the things that kept throwing me off was the dialogue, a mishmash of Arthurian English and action movie puns. An unintentionally hilarious line was supplied to Moore: After his character narrowly avoids a winged demon, he turns to Cage and says grimly, ""We're gonna need more holy water."" One idly wonders if writer Bragi F. Schut was harkening back to ""Jaws,"" specifically the moment Roy Scheider tells Robert Shaw that he would need a bigger boat. There's also plenty of that annoying sidekick irreverence on Perlman's part; he's the guy you can always depend on for a wiseass remark about everything. That might have served him well for a movie like ""Alien: Resurrection"" or ""Hellboy,"" but here, it's so painfully out of place that it's almost as if no thought went into the screenplay.

""Season of the Witch"" might have worked as an innocuous piece of gothic camp, similar to the sensibilities of Terence Fisher or Roger Corman. Granted, that would take more than a rewrite of the screenplay; it would require an entirely different angle of approach. It's one thing to make statements about organized religion, but it's quite another to make them in a story that validates fanaticism at every opportunity. The film is a paradox, and not a very well made one at that. While I can certainly give credit for the technical aspects - the production design, the costumes, the makeup, the lighting, the music - there isn't much I can say about the plot, the characters, or the performances, least of all Cage's. This is doubly baffling, considering this is the same man who won an Oscar for ""Leaving Las Vegas.""",1294358400,5,4980,4.726121979286536

Overview:

This is a movie of epic proportions, think - Lord of Rings, and you will begin to grasp the magnitude of this film in terms of its wide panoramic shots with rugged snow covered mountains with sheer cliffs. The music score is exceptional as well and there are a lot of tense moments as two heroic crusaders take a witch to a distant destination to have her demons expelled.

Background:

The story is derived from the the period of the dark ages, with particular focus on the Black Plague. This would set the film to be in the 1300s. A prelude is given in the year 1235 AD at the City of Villach, here three women convicted of witchcraft are put to death.

Story:

It starts off where 2 crusaders (Nicolas Cage and Ron Perlman) return to their home in Europe after long years of religious wars. These wars started at the Gulf of Edremit 1332, different scenes of battle are shown in 1334, 1337, 1339, and ending in 1344 at Smyrna. Knight Behmen (Cage) is now battle weary and questions his faith because of the harsh battles that he had to endure, as well as the fact that he is now reduced to slaughtering women and children.

However, upon their return, their country is reeling under the hands of another enemy, a deadly plague. Fingers are pointed to a young woman that is believed to be the black witch. However, instead of immediately burning her at the stake, as was common in medieval times, she must be taken to a distant monastery on the edge of nowhere. Knight Beham is now commanded by the moribund Cardinal to deliver a suspected witch to the abbey at this distant location. Here it is believed that monks will have the capability of delivering the young woman of her demons and then in effect releasing the land from the curse of the plague that has gripped it.

This is a suspenceful movie that has a lot of action and tension. Throughout the film you will find yourself wondering if this girl is truly a witch or just a scapegoat to blame. In the end the knights will have to face an evil beyond human comprehension. The final action sequences are quite intense, and reminded me of the old computer game called Heretic.",1291248000,28,2157,4.48469387755102

4442053,5,B004P1IXJ0,"RELEASED IN EARLY 2011 and directed by Dominic Sena, ""Season of the Witch"" chronicles events when two ex-Teutonic Knight crusaders (Nicolas Cage & Ron Pearlman) traveling through Styria in modern-day Austria are enlisted to escort an alleged witch suspected of causing the black death (Claire Foy) to a remote monastery in the mountains for trial and to hopefully stop the devastating plague. Stephen Campbell Moore (Debelzaq), Stephen Graham (Hagamar) and Robert Sheehan (Kay) accompany the Knights.

This is basically the American version of Black Death, a European film released around the same time. Both movies are dark, gritty and brutal in their depictions of Medieval Europe, but Season of the Witch is more of a stereotypical blockbuster with modish protagonists, amusing one-liners and CGI-laden climax. Black Death is deeper, more thought-provoking and realistic, which is why I give it the edge in overall value (see my review).

Season is the more conventionally entertaining movie and anyone who appreciates Dark Ages-based flicks are highly encouraged to check it out. Films which come to mind include In the Name of the Rose (1986), Kingdom of Heaven (2005), Robin Hood (2010), Ironclad (2011), King Arthur (2004), Dragonslayer (1981), Red Riding Hood (2011), ""Tristan + Isolde"" (2006) and Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves (1991). Its as good, or better, than any of these.

The Medieval cinematography (castles, dungeons, villages, dark forests and breathtaking mountains) is mind-blowing and the two protagonists are great with their amusing rapport. Furthermore, Foy is easy-on-the-eyes. Look out for a thrilling rope-bridge crossing a la Sorcerer (1977). Although the climax is over-the-top cartoony, the tone up to that point is quasi-realistic.

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 35 minutes and was shot in Austria, Hungary and Croatia with reshoots done in Louisiana. WRITERS: Bragi F. Schut. ADDITIONAL CAST: Christopher Lee is almost unrecognizable as the plague-ridden Cardinal D'Ambroise.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: SEASON OF THE WITCH [2010] stars Nicolas Cage as the worn out and disillusioned crusader Behmen, who is a Knight of the Realm who fights in the Crusades in the so called name of God and the Church, who eventually quits the Christian Crusade wars, but after a dozen battles Behman realises he has been murdering innocent people all along, and figures that it is probably not God's way and goes on the run with his buddy Felson [Ron Perlman],  only to end up in a land ravaged by the Black Death. Behmen and Felson are soon cajoled into a job that offers them a chance of salvation; by transporting the witch accused of starting the sickness that is killing hundreds and thousands of the population.

The pair stumbles across a small village, where the Black Death has descended upon the residents. Spotted by the local men are escorted to the dying Cardinal D'Ambroise [Christopher Lee], Behman and Felson are given a choice; face desertion charges, or help the local priest's efforts to take a girl deemed to be a witch [Claire Foy] to a remote monastery, where she can be dealt with, and they hope, the plague will be ended.

Eventually agreeing to the task, Behman and Felson leads a rag-tag group across dodgy bridges, through foggy forests and toward the monastery that holds a biblical book which contains the incantations required to deal with the plague-spreading witch. But with Felson you get to hear delivered such wonderful gems as ""did you see that priest's face, it's like someone pi**ed in his holy water!"" and ""I saved your behind a hundred times,"" you know you're not watching a film inspired by The Witchfinder General.

The largely American cast make no efforts to hide their accents despite dialogue written in Ye Olde English, albeit from the pen of a scriptwriter who most probably didn't bother researching a word, which leads to exchanges such as: ""Who controls your insolent tongue?"" asks a posh priest of Behman and Felson. ""Let's get the hell outta here,"" replies Nicholas Cage in a thick American accent.

There seems to be a strong moral message trying to reveal itself in SEASON OF THE WITCH. Time and again, the morality of the Crusades, and of witch-burning, comes into very serious question. One gets the sense that the screenwriters primary influences are scary video games and a vague resentment of being raised in the Catholic Church. This fantasy CGI filled-horror-adventure helps to make the film a good old jolly rollercoaster romp. Most of film SEASON OF THE WITCH best moments take place while the group is in the midst of their journey. The series of obstacles that Nicholas Cage and company encounter are relatively creative, even somewhat suspenseful and some really scary parts in the film, especially in the forest and especially when attacked by the wolves, thus keeping the audience engaged right to the very end of the film and again the film is nowhere as bad as the negative critics have commented about the film.

Blu-ray Image Quality  Momentum Pictures brings us this Blu-ray release in a stunning 1080p image presentation, and what is very noticeable about this transfer is its sharpness and is helped along the way with the 1.85:1 aspect ratio. The film looks quite spectacular, especially when it comes to its darker and moody visuals that hold up very nicely, with some fine grain and amazing detail, and please check out the pores on Nicholas Cages face. The contrast is really excellent and the black levels are suitably inky in the frequent dark scenes and make the film look extremely very stylized look to it and the colours are not sacrificed and there is a great deal of detail present despite the dreary surroundings.  Both the Director of Photography Amir Mokri and Production Designer Uli Hanisch should be applauded for adding to the films impressive visual style. Please Note: Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Momentum Pictures presents us with a very good and excellent 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio experience, with robust and aggressive surround soundscapes, especially with the very good bass and especially with the lively action scenes. Dialogue is never drowned out; especially with no distortions I can report. Surround sounds are organically mixed with plenty of atmospherics to go around all the speakers. Overall, this is a very impressive sound mix and will not disappoint you, and there are many good uses of atmospheric ambient sounds used throughout the film. Whether it is battle sequences, or a trek through the wolf-infested woods, the surround sound was excellent.  Dialogue is front and centre but very clear and intelligible throughout.  Theres a lot of good effects work in this mix that is well utilized across all of the channels along with some nice cross-panning for certain scenes.  The various battle sequences sounded great, especially the final one with the demon and I was very happy with this mix.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: The Making of SEASON OF THE WITCH [2011] [1080p] [1.78:11] [9:32] Here have a sort in-depth look at the scenario of the premise of the film SEASON OF THE WITCH and what they wanted achieve with the storyline. Also some of the cast talk about their characters and what they wanted to project their goal in the film, as well as some of the crew voice their opinions on what they wanted to achieve with the film. We also get some brilliant rare behind-the-scene filming and how they achieved some of the dramatic specially effects. Despite being a very short special feature, they certainly pack in a lot of interesting information and well worth a look. Contributors include: Nicholas Cage [Behman], Alex Gartner [Producer], Charles Roven [Producer], Dominic Sena [Director], Clair Foy [The Girl/Witch] and Ron Perlman [Felson].

Theatrical Trailer [2010] [1080p] [1.78:1] [2:19] This is the original and very dramatic Original Theatrical trailer for the film SEASON OF THE WITCH.

Sneak Previews: THE FIGHTER [2010] [1080p] [2.35:1] [2:28]; THE MECHANIC [2011] [1080P] [2.35:1] and MONSTERS [2010] [1080p] [2.35:1] [00:22].

Finally, SEASON OF THE WITCH [2010] has had some very severe negative reviews and I feel that is totally unfair and this film does not come anyway near as bad as it has been reviewed, those critics must have had experienced a very bad day or got out of the bed the wrong side. The scenery is breath-taking. The special effects, which kick in the film around the second half, are totally brilliant. With the short cameo appearance by Christopher Lee, who has some really brilliant awesome grotesque make-up, as well as the monks you see near the end of the film. SEASON OF THE WITCH is a decent gothic horror film thrown in for good measure. The film is nowhere near as bad as everyone makes it out to be and people should get a life and I say if you can do any better, then you direct a film. If you have low expectations like I did, you will probably get a lot more enjoyment out of it. Highly Recommended!

4442092,4,B004P1IXJ0,"It's not that bad, it's just that since so much money was invested in Game of Thrones that's the benchmark. Any medieval storyline without a high budget, especially in the genre of movie which traditionally have more money poured into them than TV shows, movies like this with a regular budget now are just very noticeable. Especially in the fight scenes, the lack of blood, gore and severed body parts. It's pretty obvious the background is a green screen when they are riding on horses when transporting the witch and talking to each other. It's a kid friendly medieval tale, there's no nudity or sex. I'm pretty sure there was no swearing. The fact these characters are supposed to be European in the times of the Crusades and they have American accents also doesn't help it either.  But if you want something medieval to pass an hour and a half of your time, this one is still entertaining enough.

Basic plot has Nicolas Cage and Ron Perlman (Hellboy / Sons of Anarchy) as two top killing machine knights who regularly be who will each kill the lager total of 300 or more during each army or castle their battalion of the Christian crusaders slaughter.  But when they realise their latest castle is full of women and children and their leader doesn't care, they quit the crusades.  But they find it hard to find food in the baron lands their army has gone through, the plague also has come back.  At a city they stop in for supplies they are recognised as deserters and given an ultimatum.  Deliver a girl (Claire Foy - Wolf Hall) accused of being a witch to a monastery who the town believes is responsible for the plague outbreak.  The journey there is pretty much the rest of the movie.",1496102400,,1694,4.570957095709571

The ferocious CGI wolves are massively and graphically slaughtered, but leave the real horses in the scene completely unstirred. But the film is a success, engaging medieval concerns of witchcraft, theological mysteries, and life and death, but leaving them unresolved. As Cardinal d'Ambroise, Christopher Lee masterfully portrays Life in Death. The Demogorgon is easily as hideous and frightening as any demon in the Hammer horror films.",1491264000,2,577,5.880952380952381

There was definitely some humor, especially between Nicholas Cage and his fellow co-hort Felson.  They definitely had a few one liners and zingers back and forth.  A few of those things I doubt would have been said quite like that but it was funny.  There was definitely an interesting twist to the movie towards the end.  I would like to watch it again with my full attention.  I did like that the costumes and scenery looked authentic.

4442237,5,B004P1IXJ0,"Set at the time of 1322 A.D. and onward..., the Crusaders battle the enemies of God and the Church. However, over the course of time, weary and disillusioned from over-bearing commanders, the Crusader as portrayed by handsome and sexy Actor Nicolas Cage and his soldier (Ron Perlman), leave the bloody battleground and embark on their own quest for a mission outside of warfare. But, as fate would have it, no sooner do they set out they reluctantly find themselves on a harrowing mission. So much so, that this is one journey that they may not come back, from. The 'Dark Age' medieval mentality of fear and suspicion is very appropriate in this thrilling, gothic drama. The entourage of Crusader and company, have the unique distinction of escorting a caged witch, in the form of a young girl, and have to deal with more than they bargained for while on their way to a remote and mysterious, monastery. In addition, they encounter the Black Plague epidemic, wolves that turn into hell hounds, haunting visions, manifestations and transformations and a bridge, that almost kills them all. Approximately 1 hour and 35 minutes on a single, DVD disc, this supernatural, action/adventure drama, is a movie that you can't watch, just once. Why? Perhaps because of the mystical depth into which you will be drawn into..., a spiritual dimension which most have not experienced and you will seemingly be compelled to watch it, more than once. If anything, to absorb the fact that witches, demons and Hell, are a reality and that people do get possessed by demons which makes exorcisms and deliverance, a necessity. Fascinating and riveting entertainment. Nina Kish",1435190400,,1656,4.981949458483754

Usually I wouldn't have watched the film (due to Mr. Cages acting abilities or, to be precise, the lack of them), but it's kind of national pride that sends me to the movies when a film was shot in Austria (Locations were Salzburg, Styria and Lower Austria where I hail from - Burg Kreuzenstein is 40 miles from my hometown). The film itself was not very bad (if the rumous are true it must have had a troubled production). Still it's well executed by director Dominic Sena and the cast is good all around (except...I know, enough of Mr. Cage). One thing that prevented me from giving it a five star rating was the CGI orgy at the end of the film. A quiet and more subtle ending would have inhanced the all around effect of the film immensely. The atmosphere the film exuded when the knights set out to deliver their cargo was a really creepy one (especially the encounter with the wolves was really scary). All in all it was a well made A Picture with all it's trappings and failures but still a nice and enjoyable ride.",1430870400,,1132,4.31924882629108

4442283,4,B004P1IXJ0,"Had to laugh through this movie. It's like they made a list of every ""action"" and ""supernatural"" thing they could think of - and then crammed it all in. Sword fights, crusades, evil wolves, rickety bridges, the walking dead - you name it, they had it. While they weren't subtle about using every trick in the book, it was still a surprisingly good movie!

There's loads of bad reviews slamming just about everything related to this movie - bad acting, terrible ""modern"" dialogue, bad CGI, lack of authenticity, etc. Honestly I wasn't even sure it would be worth seeing based on the reviews, but I'm glad I did. I think that to enjoy this movie you just have to sit back and ride the ride. Yes, they checked authenticity and believability at the door, but that doesn't mean it's a bad movie.

Here's why I think it's worth watching:

The look and feel of the movie is excellent. They went for the dirty, plague-ridden view of the middle ages, and I thought they did a nice job building the atmosphere of the film. And while it certainly felt medieval, it wasn't *too* gory or gruesome to watch, which I appreciated. I also thought the CGI and visual effects were appropriate. The ONLY time they got on my nerves was in the alternate ending (too much 'rag doll body'). The rest of the time I thought the effects blended nicely and added to the overall spooky atmosphere.

The suspense throughout the movie is also excellent. The plot isn't very complicated, but there were enough little twists and turns to keep things interesting. It also isn't overloaded with too many ""action"" scenes (like a lot of these movies are). There was a nice balance between character-building scenes (campfire stories) and character-destroying scenes (sword through the belly & such).

And, the girl who plays the witch is really very good. She keeps you guessing through most of the movie - is she really a witch or an innocent victim of the times? She has excellent facial expressions, and I found her fascinating to watch. Not many young actresses can pull off ""I'm a helpless puppy, please rescue me! (whimper, whimper)"" AND ""I'm an evil soul-sucking demon who's going to rip you to shreds! (evil cackle)."" The rest of the actors were also surprisingly better than the reviews led me to believe they would be.

And, yes, the dialogue is totally out of context, and yes, sometimes ""modern"" banter superimposed on historical settings is annoying. It worked in this movie, though, for two reasons: the entire movie is pretty ridiculous, so I had no expectation of authenticity from the start. It also helped provide a little levity in an otherwise dark and gruesome movie. I didn't laugh because the lines were funny. I laughed because they were ridiculous, but even so, I still appreciated the mental break from all the faces covered in boils.

Overall, this is good 'old-fashioned' supernatural thriller. Take a creepy witch, add abandoned villages filled with diseased corpses, throw in some foggy woods, a few religious zealots, a couple of disenchanted knights and a zombie or two - and you get a pretty fun movie. This is one I would watch again - perfect mindless entertainment for a rainy weekend.",1426118400,,3184,4.778181818181818

4442290,4,B004P1IXJ0,"I don't know about this year, or the last few.  But seeing what ends up at the oscars, several years ago, for several years, with my last woman type, leads me to suspect I would much prefer this movie over most, probably all, of those.

An enjoyable movie.  Not exactly mainstream, but mainstream is beyond lame.  More so than ever.  Having no queers or communists preaching, that I saw, or any other leftist material to ruin the thing was nice.  I even wondered if this was going to be yet another unfulfilling sophomoric strike at the church or military.  Actually, those types of movies are part of what initially guided me to the church.  If it's feared and hated by obvious dropouts and losers... might be worth a shot, I thought to myself.  It turns out, in the end, the movie was no more, and quite similar, to my past and ongoing struggles with the church.  No, it's not a super great film all should watch.  But it passes well as a inoffensive entertainment.

I keep not liking N. Cage, as an actor, but enjoying the work he is in.  It's an odd thing.  I'm not really a critic of talent, I either like and actor or actress or whatever, or I don't.  I am a simple consumer.  So... this baffles me.  Still, it is what it is.",1424390400,2,1231,4.328947368421052
4442291,2,B004P1IXJ0,"This movie's like a slightly better version of Van Helsing. Different plot, but same type of special effects and a rushed, almost non-existent storyline.

This film is crap- mind you I don't mind watching some crap.  It wasn't terribly annoying crap, just a far cry from an epic and entertaining Knights Journey type film.

As far as all the positive reviews regarding authenticity... uh, please explain the Bronx accents on multiple characters and modern day slang.  They must have edited out the high-fives and ""Good One Bro!""

Interesting note that the script won the prestigious Nicholls award.  It was either dramatically changed during production or this execution was a train wreck of unfortunate decisions- starting with the cast.

They are soon arrested for being deserters and thrown in prison. Behmen and Felson are forced to take a woman to a remote monastery who is accused of witchcraft and starting the Black Plague.

4442388,4,B004P1IXJ0,"I can't think of the name Season of the Witch without thinking of the 60s song :). However, that's not what this movie is about. Rather, it's about Nicholas Cage and Ron Perlman as crusaders in the Middle Ages who develop a conscience. They desert, strive to escape the church's clutches, and are drawn right back in again.

Season of the Witch I'll note that I view this movie not as an ""entertainment vehicle"" but as a portrayal of medieval times, since I write medieval novels. In that sense Season of the Witch does quite well.

The movie is set in the 1300s - deep in the days of the Black Plague. Medieval people had no idea why this plague had come, or if it would ever end. The plague wiped out massive amounts of people. Entire villages. Entire regions. From a medieval person's point of view, this pestilence would soon destroy all of mankind. Their only way of coping with this was to assume they'd done something to displease God and if they could just figure it out, they might be saved.

This was a very real situation that went on. The Black Plague was quite horrific. It wasn't just that people were dying - they were dying in gruesome ways. There was no way to stop it. It was a time of despair.

Bleibruck - Cage's character - is also fairly realistic. Sure, he and his pal might not have been such ""superheroes"" at combat, as the movie presents them. However, there was a lot of slaughter during the Crusades, and there were certainly men who thrived and succeeded in that arena. There were also men who finally balked at the mindless killing of women and children.

The movie received some fairly bad reviews. Certainly the redeeming-a-soldier theme is a bit cliche, and it's handled a bit roughly. The two men revel in battle and destruction for years and years, and then *poof* they change their mind. It might have been better to show that mindset creeping in. Also, I suppose the movie overall is an odd mix of realism and supernatural.

But that being said, I think they did a stellar job with the costumes and portrayal of medieval times, which is my primary interest. The Black Plague times were gritty and nasty. People decayed alive. The long-nosed ""black plague mask"" the doctors wore were authentic. The idea was that the mask would keep the doctors somewhat safe from the plague. The fear and hysteria of the times was real. The sense that towns were crumbling in on themselves, that people had no idea of where to turn, all of it is authentic.

So, with so many other medieval movies presenting a shiny, polished view on this time period, I think Season of the Witch did its job well. I've seen this movie several times now and each time I'm impressed with the clothing and atmosphere that is provided.

And, as a bonus, you get a glimpse of The Hound from Game of Thrones in the opening scene :).

I'll give it 4/5 stars for transporting us into another time, one we're glad not to be in any more.",1390262400,,2931,4.4943609022556394

It definitely ends in a way you would not expect and if a movie kind even slightly blows my mind I am very impressed.

4442393,3,B004P1IXJ0,"If you are looking for a life-changing movis, this is not the movie for you. If you are looking for a movie to pass a winter's night and provide a little escapism, this is the movie for you.

Nicholas Cage plays a knight who, after years of success in the Crusades, becomes disheartened by the murder of innocent women and children. With his friend, Felson, he leaves, but on their way home, they run into a town full of plague. The inhabitants believe the cause is a young witch, who they want to have taken to the monk's court, where a special book can cast out the witch.  Beyland, Cage's character, says he will take her, but only if she gets a fair trial, so, along with a priest, a man who has lost his family in the plague, a swindler, an altar boy who wants to become a knight, Felson, and himself, they take the girl to the monastery. The journey is dangerous, and there are several moments which will have you wondering if they will make it. And when they reach the monastery, their greatest test will come to pass.

This isn't a fabulous movie, but it's not bad either. The suspense is well-drawn-out. We are never quite sure whether ""the girl"" is a witch or not; the writers see-saw back and forth with their portrayal of her in a pretty cool way. The action moves along quickly; I never felt like I wanted it to be over, and I thought the story was quite original.

A few small nitpicks--no one in the party gets the plague during the journey, meanwhile everyone else is dropping like flies. Does this mean it was a supernatural pestilence, or they just had good genes? And the accents are not remotely consistent between characters or even in the characters themselves. Cage loses his accent at the end, and one of the other characters has an accent reminiscent of Brooklyn, only it's in the 1300s, and no one else has one.

All in all, though, there isn't a need to nitpick this movie. It's an interesting fantasy tale that doesn't try too hard to have a great message. Just enjoy it.",1386547200,,1999,4.421195652173913

These veteran crusaders try to return home from the wars only to become embroiled in a quest against evil. The setting is the Styrian March, an encastled land of mystery no less so in actual history than in this film. Styria, nestled between southern Austria and Croatia, was later the scene of intense battles between the surging Ottoman Turks and the scions of the Holy Roman Empire. In literature, it was the home of the Karnstein vampires. In this film, however, our heroes find trouble not with vampires, but with witches and a particularly potent demon. Ah yes, and with a collapsing mountain bridge and a pack of wolves on steroids. A European movie filmed in Austria and Hungary which will resonate with North American audiences for its even-paced action and CGI-enhanced backgrounds. This held my attention throughout.

Bad in the sense that the story is not only idiotic, on about a third grade level, nothing but repulsive CGI green screen FX, but also that it totally distorts reality & history. It has no redeeming value at all. Cage and Perlman, normally fine actors, must have been really low on cash to sign up for this mess.

During the Dark Ages, when religion and superstition reigned supreme, literally millions of innocent women were murdered by religious fanatics simply because they couldn't prove they were not witches. Which was, of course, impossible, since once a woman was accused she had only two choices. Either she denied being a witch, in which case she was tortured and murdered, or she ""confessed"" in order to avoid being tortured, in which case she was simply murdered. That's the real horror of the historical reality. The self-righteous self-absolving self-justification that can rationalize any act, and lurks behind the pious veil of religion and superstition.

OK, so it's just another creepy low-budget horror flick. Except it isn't just another horror flick.

4442474,2,B004P1IXJ0,"Two crusading knights receive the task of transporting a suspected witch through treacherous terrain so that she may stand trial before the church after being accused of causing the Black Plague in SEASON OF THE WITCH. The premise seems thrilling enough, but SEASON OF THE WITCH is sabotaged by its incompetent special effects and unworthy cast. The period setting which director Dominic Sena tries to convey is drowned out by poorly computerized environments that generate a sense of artifice on screen. What makes matters worse are the laughable performances by Nicholas Cage and Ron Perlman, who can't be bothered with simple things like diction or accent when it comes to creating a convincing 14th-century character. Sena doesn't allow for much suspense when we are quickly given glimpses into the witch's powers, leaving behind a long and perilous viewing experience instead. For a superior take on the same theme, be sure to check out Christopher Smith's BLACK DEATH from 2010.

4442504,1,B004P1IXJ0,"Is it too much to ask that a film make ANY sense at all.

Ok - so the premise of this film is that a girl is possessed by demon.  This demon wants to destroy a book of magic that is being held at a castle.  So - the demon (girl) pretends to be a witch so that the church will capture her and put her on trial for witchcraft.  This trial would apparently need to take place at the castle.  The ""witch"" is being blamed for a plague and the church thinks that by ridding itself of her the plague will be gone.

Got that?  Ok - so the church needs to send the witch girl (who is really a demon) on a trip to this castle under armed escort.  She travels in a cage (on a wagon) and eventually they get there, at which time the demon reveals itself, tries to destroy the book, etc.

Here is the problem.  This is a very powerful demon with wings (hiding in the girl's body).  Someone please tell me why in the heck this demon needs to go about this big charade in order to get to the castle.  What?  Could the demon not fly there itself?  What's the point?  Why does the demon need to hitch a ride in a cage?  Why go through all of the trouble?  Why not just fly in the window at night, grab the book, and be done with it?

Can anyone think of any reason why the demon needed to pretend to be a witch in order to get to the castle?  Is there any reason why it couldn't make the trip itself?  If the demon feels the need to possess someone, why not just possess one of the monks at the castle?  I don't know... maybe this is just a really dumb demon...",1353024000,,1544,3.9161290322580644
4442505,3,B004P1IXJ0,"The people who rated this movie down were looking for the witch to be a beguiling seductress and have spooky Ringu powers, or a frail teenage victim thing. The movie's not dependent on a teenager's self-absorbtion, so right away, you're going to lose the people who like movies like ""Darkest Hour"" or ""Cloverfield"". There are others who wanted to see a big victim thing, where you get mad and depressed by a neverending series of torture and rape scenes, with the big guy having big revenge at the end. There's none of that, so you lose the ""Game of Thrones"" people.

I liked it. I particularly liked the prisoner: she acted like a prisoner. If I were on my way to a ""trial"" that really sounded more like a-burning-at-the stake, I might be given to behaving morose and sullen. :) (That remark is for the guy who said he didn't find the witch likable.) I might be given to sporadic violence in an attempt to free myself. (That remark is for the people who think it's ""silly"" that a young woman would be able to stab someone or be able to effectively wrestle free. Actually, it's pretty silly to assume they'd be too meek, calm, and feeble to not even try.) And even though she attacked her captor, it's still very believable that she would try to sway their sympathies in favor of either freeing her or gaining their trust. All of these behaviors make her look more like a witch to these escorts, of course.
I also liked it that that wasn't all there was to the story. It wasn't out of the scope of the story, either-the people who think it turned into ""Van Helsing"" were members of the ""Darkest Hour"" crowd. Those people don't have much of an attention span, though (goldfish have a longer attention span).

The dialog does have two or three lines of wannabe hero banter, but it's brief, and no where near as bad as some of these commenters would have you believe.

Finally, the movie has something that a lot of others are definitely missing: structure and pacing. It also does a good job of creating mood; (another attribute that a lot movies are lacking in these days) you really get the feeling of isolation that the travelers have.

All in all, I liked it. It's pretty, and it's not dripping with sentiment and ""tragedy"", and it's not a monument to teenage self-indulgent crap. I wouldn't mind seeing it again.",1352160000,,2315,4.5311004784688995

4442507,4,B004P1IXJ0,"Season of the Witch(released Jan/11)was Relativity Medias first in house production/release,but from what I recall in the trade papers,had some production/distribution difficulties. It was taken out of Lionsgate's hands and then subsequent previews lacked the praise they were after,so they re-shot some scenes and made some editing changes(A British contingent was apparently brought in to kick start the renewed cut).Whatever problems may have occurred in pre-release,the cut we have here on DVD is a gem,a total gem. The pairing of Nicolas Cage as Behman von Bleibruck,and his devoted friend Ron Perlman as Felson,is an unlikely one I will grant you,but after watching the film I saw a good on screen chemistry between the two stars that really enhanced the picture.
The plot involves the Europe of the 14th Century. Witches,real or not,are being killed in many towns and villages for being part of a wide spread plague that is killing the populace(a reference to the actual Bubonic plague that was sweeping Europe at that time).Into the picture comes two Knights of the Crusades,Cage and Perlman,who are devoted friends and fierce warriors. They serve Gods greater purpose in the extermination of all HIS enemies,and go through several grueling campaigns together. On their last campaign,during a seige of a round walled city,Cage accidentally kills a young girl. Both look around only to be surrounded by women and children lying dead at their feet. They confront the leader of Crusade and essentially give him notice and leave.
They travel for days not seeing anyone,until they come upon a town which Perlman advises against going into. Yet they are short on supplies and are in dire need of rest. They enter the city only to find it is also under siege by the plague. However the towns constabulary arrests the two for being Crusade deserters,and locks them up. The local Cardinal(Christopher Lee),who is himself stricken by the plague and dying,summons the two to his chamber. In turn for their pardon and release,he asks them to take a young girl,deemed a witch,to a monastery about six days ride away to be put on trial. Cage and Perlman reluctantly agree. They are accompanied by a local priest,a Knight,a young altar boy who wants to be a Knight and a thief who apparently knows the best route to their destination.
Off the group go,with the witch imprisoned inside a large metal cage,being pulled by two horses. The first night the girl escapes from her cage and flees into a local village. They end up recapturing the girl but in the confusion and darkness the Knight walks right into the altar boys sword and dies. Their next trial is over a rickety old bridge. The group barely makes it over,but during their travail the young girl saved the altar boy from falling by pulling him up with just one hand. Directly after this they enter the Wormwood forest,where many a traveler have entered but never come out. The way is too foggy and wet and they camp on the road until it clears. However a wolf like howl comes from the cage and soon they're surrounded by many wolves bent on their deaths. They attack in two waves. They suppress the first wave and flee immediately. However the second wave claims the life of the thief,who they are unable to get to in time,and have to leave to die.
It is at this point Cage cannot contain his anger and comes thisclose to killing the witch,but is stopped by the priest and his friend Perlman,who tells him there is no point as the monastery is in sight. They arrive shorty after at their destination but find it strangely silent,until they reach a chamber to find virtually all of the monks dead of plague. They recover the Book of Solomon,which contains a myriad of ancient holy incantations to rid the flesh of evil spirits. The group returns outside and the priest starts to read from the book. The witch suddenly starts to mimic the crusade's leaders words back to Cage,and it is then they realize this is not a witch but a demon,which requires a different incantation. The demon melts the iron cage and flees into the monastery and the group/fight returns there. The demon brings to life dead monks to battle the group and finally the demon himself joins in,all the while the proper incantation is being recited aloud. The priest and Perlman succumb to the demon,but just before Cage joins them,the young altar boy now turned Knight,finishes the passage and the demon is destroyed.
The film ends as the altar boy/Knight and the girl whose body was possessed,both ride off together,with the Book of Solomon safely in his saddle bag.
I found the film pulling me in right from the start. Perlman of course,known for his macho roles and mannerisms,is just what we would expect him to be here. Cage on the other hand is the more thoughtful of the two,in keeping with his persona in films. The two make an unlikely pairing,as I stated previously,but they certainly work well together. The plot is well crafted and the pre-release problems were certainly ironed out well,as the editing and pace is top notch. There are very few,if any,slow moments in this film as the group go from one crisis into another. All the time we are still wondering,like Cage's on screen character,whether the girl really is a witch or not. The opening scenes of the Crusade battles are done with a mixture,it looks like,of CGI and in camera tricks,but it is effective. You really believe Perlamn and Cage are out there sweating and at the edge of death at all times,battling the multitudinous hordes that they confront.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:78:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include commentary,the trailer,deleted scenes,an alternate ending and two featurettes.
All in all a film I surprisingly liked....ALOT!The pace and editing are right there and Perlman,Cage and the rest of the cast are solid ""A"",right on the money. The plot keeps you on the edge of your seats until the every end. It strikes a variety of moods throughout from light-hearted to dark and foreboding. Highly recommended. 4-4 1/2 stars.",1351382400,,6068,4.863768115942029

I am happy to say I was wrong.

It's fun and engaging.

Yes, the plot is claptrap--beyond claptrap.  But it's very stylish claptrap, and entertaining to boot.

Nicolas Cage, who can act if he wants to, is good.  He is believably confused, betrayed, open-hearted, indecisive, and decisive.  Ron Perlman is his usual gruff likable self.  And Claire Foy (Little Dorrit!) is exceptional as the Black Witch who is being blamed for the Black Plague.

The initial scenes, of the Crusades, are a little too camp.  But they end well, with the siege of Smyrna and Cage's realization and shock at what barbarism he has been perpetrating.

After that, the scenes are perfect: gloomy medievalism all the way.

The ending is a little cheesy, but likable all the same.  SPOILER: almost everybody dies, but this simply makes the movie touching (amazingly).

After the first few minutes of terrible dialogue, I began to second guess this hypothesis. In addition to the cheesy script, the technical aspects were shabby, especially the green screen work and costuming choices such as Cage's wig. The movie's saving grace is the performance by Claire Foy (Little Dorrit). Her pixie charm casts a spell, leaving us suspended between wondering if we can keep her, and wondering why they didn't bring more holy water.",1341187200,,550,4.8
4442526,4,B004P1IXJ0,"The movie starts out in 1235 AD as 3 women accused of witchcraft are hung and drowned. The priest wants the bodies pulled up from the water so he can perform a ritual on them so they can't return from the dead. As always, resurrected witches have more power than when they were alive. This was all done to show you the ritual book. We jump ahead to 1332 AD with the savoy Nickolas Cage and Ron Perlman fighting in the crusades. After 7 years of rape, killing, pillage and plunder in the name of God's only son, Cage decides this is wrong and calls it quits. Cage and Perlman leave the crusades. Through a series of events, they agree to escort a girl accused of witchcraft, to a group of monks 6 days travel away, so they can judge her. They believe she caused the plague. They get as a guide a man who sold fake church artifacts.

Weird things happen along the way as we suspect the girl really is a witch. The Cardinal had a very distinguished voice, which can be no one other than Christopher Lee. The special effects were good, but the plot lacked. The ending of the story was all wrong. The guide, who was a colorful character was severely under utilized.

4442527,3,B004P1IXJ0,"It's the year 1332 and two Crusaders called Behmen von Bleibruck (Nicolas Cage) and his companion Felson (Ron Perlman) become disillusioned by the wars that are fought in the name of God. They abandon the cause and return to England to find that the plague is devastating the land. Caught by church authorities, they are offered a deal: in return for absolution, they must transport the cause of the disease to a distant monastery where she can be properly judged. This so-called source is a terrified and tortured young girl that the church has accused of witchcraft. Behmen is unconvinced of her guilt and so agrees to escort her, on the condition that she get a fair trial on reaching the monastery.

Along with the usual suspects: a zealous priest, a grizzled warrior, an untrustworthy rogue and a nave wannabe knight, the company sets out with the witch in tow. I guess I'm just in a generous mood, but I enjoyed ""Season of the Witch"". It doesn't pretend to be a good movie - heck, it doesn't even *try* to be a good movie, but it's silly enough fun for a rainy Saturday night and manages to sustain a tense atmosphere that holds your attention throughout.

Believe it or not, the plot manages some surprising twists. There are some subversions to the array of stock characters that make up the cast, and what's waiting for them all at the abbey is certainly not what anyone expects. The most interesting conceit of the film is of course: is the girl really a witch? Unfortunately, chances are that you already know the answer: trailers and reviews aren't particularly shy about spoiling it, but if you watch with no preconceptions whatsoever, then the film does actually manage to raise some suspense over the question of her guilt/innocence - it only lasts about ten minutes, but it's there. And while it's there, it's rather fascinating. In one particularly good scene, she manages to save someone's life through supernatural means, which only throws further doubt on her motivation. And who'd have thought? The last scene is actually rather touching.

The worst part is the two leads: it's not that Nicolas Cage and Ron Perlman aren't charismatic in their own odd ways; but in this particular movie, they look like 21st century blokes looking for a quick paycheck. Which is exactly what they are. Obviously they've been cast to sell the film, but whereas the rest of the actors manage to blend into the grimy medieval atmosphere of the film, Nick and Ron are just...well, Nick and Ron. Loose them and the whole story could have worked just as well with the supporting characters in the lead roles (and given a reason to cut out the lengthy and rather pointless Crusade prologue which gives the film a slow start - things don't really get moving until the convoy sets off to the abbey).

Watch out for a cameo by Christopher Lee as a cardinal (though don't expect to recognize him; he's suffering from the plague) as well as Claire Foy as the titular witch: she can go from wide-eyed fear to unsettling confidence and leaves you guessing as to what her true motivation really is. The beginning is a bit slow, and the final act is utterly ridiculous, but the journey to the abbey, fraught with various obstacles and the mystery of the witch's true nature, is more fun than expected.",1340582400,,3289,4.714782608695653

Its not an Oscar winner or something I'd watch over and over again. Nicholas Cage's acting is hit or miss and so are his movies. There were a couple of flaws in the movie. First off since this movie is set in England so shouldn't the director think about giving Nicholas Cage and Ron Perlman an English Accent?

4442537,4,B004P1IXJ0,"Superstition runs rampant in the middle ages and with the approach of the plague in certain cities, it is believed that witches are in the midst of the common men. Thus, suspicious women are being hunted down and persecuted. Meanwhile, thousands of miles away, the knights of the realm are engaged in a Holy War, the Crusades. Best friends and fellow warriors Behmen (Nicholas Cage) and Felson (Ron Pearlman) have fought for years in the name of the Church -- but when their task turns to wanton slaughter of innocent women and children, they abandon their vows and return to Europe. Their wandering brings them to a small town where unfortunately, they are recognized. The prevailing bishop (Christopher Lee) offers them a means of escape -- to escort a witch to a monastery deep in the mountains in the hope of exorcising her influence and lifting the plague.

Neither man is interested... not even when a monk, Debelzaq (Stephen Campbell Moore), begs with them to heed the calling of the Church. But then Behmen encounters the supposed witch (Claire Foy) -- beautiful and capable of tugging at his heartstrings, she senses in him a kindness that will not allow him to permit her to be charged without proof. Thus, he agrees on the condition that she will have a fair trial upon reaching their destination. Together with the others and an ambitious, aspiring young would-be knight named Kay (Robert Sheehan), they travel into the wilderness. But to prove whether or not she is a witch, they must reach their destination... and no one realizes what lies ahead. Reading what various reviews have to say about this film you would think it's downright terrible. I won't lie to you, it's not a masterpiece by any means, but it's also quite good fun. The dialogue is witty and full of banter and many of the scenes are downright creepy, as they should be. Honestly, I think what weakened audience reactions to it is the twist in the second half, when it becomes less a supernatural medieval thriller and more like The Exorcist... but with CGI wings. I actually think it would have been scarier not to involve winged demons and merely let the actors play it out, but even so... it's entertaining.

The cast is quite good, particularly Claire Foy as she leads the audience on -- we never know whether to trust her or warn the others not to turn their back on her. She can be sweet and helpless one moment and casting a diabolical grin the next. Obviously, in a movie of this nature there is going to be manifestations of ... something. To some it might seem witchcraft but here it is not what we expect. The first three fourths of this film are terrific -- suspenseful, misleading, and with good character development. It falters a bit toward the end when it becomes a little too incredible; it shifts gears midstride and becomes less a historical epic and more of a fantasy-horror film. It just feels awkward, but in comparison to the other film with the same basic theme (Black Death) this is a considerable improvement, with absolutely beautiful scenery and a great musical score. It may not win any awards and probably won't even be a film I will add to my collection, but it was worth a rental. And... yeah, probably even a rewatch.",1332892800,,3231,4.686619718309859

4442539,4,B004P1IXJ0,"that old black magic that you weave so well.

The film starts out with an encounter with a real witch just to let us know that it's not pussyfooting around. Now we flash forward to the 14th century. Brave crusader knights Behmen (Nicolas Cage) and Felson (Ron Perlman) get fed up with their slaughtering ways and desert.

Soon they are pressed into a new mission. With a motley rabble they must deliver a supposed witch (Claire Foy) to a monastery to break the back of the plague that could take over the world.

We spend most of our time in this film wondering if she or isn't she. We may find that this mission is a part of something much greater than a simple fricassee of witch. As we watch Behmen and Felson's struggling with their own differences between God and the church we to have some food for thought.

Keep in mind this film is really a simple who is the bad guy and will they get their film. There actually isn't any excess gore but a few spooky scenes with fiery eyes.

4442540,2,B004P1IXJ0,"""Season of the Witch"" is one of those movies that probably would have gone straight to SyFy/Sci-Fi, if it didn't have an A-list actor attached. It's a murky, rather rushed historical creep-out that blossoms into silly horror at the end, after a long journey where not very much happens. Ron Perlman is awesome, though.

Disgusted with the slaughter of the Crusades, knights Behmen (Nicholas Cage) and Felson (Perlman) desert the army to return home to... somewhere. I think it's England, but I'm not sure.

They arrive in a town infested with the Black Death, and are quickly arrested. But the local bishop (Christopher Lee) offers them a way to clean their slates -- take a witch (Claire Foy) who is blamed for the plague to a distant abbey where she will be depowered courtesy of an ancient spellbook. The embittered Behman doesn't believe she's a witch, but he agrees nevertheless.

Along with a priest, a soldier, a swindler and an altar boy who dreams of knighthood, the two knights take the suspected witch on the perilous journey. But soon Behman starts to suspect that there's something unnatural about her -- she has super-strength, summons wolves, and even makes one man hallucinate right to his death. But no one can guess the horrific truth about what she is until they reach the abbey.

""Season of the Witch"" isn't a horrible film, but it is resolutely mediocre -- it has the feel of a movie where nobody was really trying very hard. In fact, the first three-fourths of the movie just sort of ooze by with lots of dirty medieval villages, spooky hints about the witch girl, and lots of misty forests full of giant wolves.

Even the cameramen and screenwriters aren't trying too hard. It's almost impossible to see what the heck is going on in the fight scenes, except that there are lots of swords and leaves. The dialogue is pretty standard buddy-cop stuff, and is laid out in a hodgepodge of inconsistent accents. Are these Crusaders SUPPOSED to sound so American?

The movie does pick up for about ten minutes when the characters reach the abbey -- storms of darkness, zombie monks, incantations, and a decent Linda Blair impression. The problem is.... we see the bad guy. And it looks RIDICULOUS -- I've seen Star Trek prosthetics that were scarier than that, especially when it starts flitting, scuttling and spinning around the place.

The acting is pretty lackluster -- Cage is phoning in his performance, and most of the supporting characters are so blandly underdeveloped that you can't really care when they get offed. I will say that Stephen Campbell Moore does a decent job as a priest whose faith helps him overcome his fear, and Robert Sheehan and Claire Foy are very earnest in their roles. Oh, and Ron Perlman is lots of fun as Felson. It's pretty obvious he knows he's in a stinker, so he decides to have fun with his laid-back, fun-loving character.

""Season of the Witch"" could have been a semi-decent horror thriller if it had kept the bad guy hidden, but that makes the entire climax fall apart.",1329868800,,3029,4.7561904761904765

4442553,2,B004P1IXJ0,"I watched Black Death and Season of the Witch a week apart, which gives some perspective on what goes right and what goes terribly wrong in both films.  They both share a similar plot: during the Black Plague, holy knights (in both movies, Teutonic Knights judging from their attire) are sent to retrieve a witch who is to be put on trial for her crimes, a crime tied to the plague.  In Black Death it's a town that avoids the plague and is rumored to bring the dead back to life; in Season of the Witch it's a witch who is believed to have caused the plague. In fact, Season of the Witch could almost be a sequel to Black Plague, as it starts with the with (Black Death's ""necromancer"") already captured.

Like Black Death, Teutonic Knights are drafted to return the witch for trial.  In this case its two jaded Crusaders named Behmen von Bleibruck (Nicolas Cage) and his lifelong companion Felson (Ron Perlman).  Captured for deserting the Crusades, they agree to accompany priest Debelzeq (Stephen Campbell Moore); grizzled knight Eckhart (Ulrich Thomsen), swindler and guide Hagamar (Stephen Graham), tagalong altar boy turned prospective warrior Kay von Wollenbarth (Robert Sheehan), and of course the cutie-pie witch herself Anna (Claire Foy).

Season of the Witch flirts with the idea that the witch might be innocent...for about five minutes. Then it simply gives up and makes it clear that something is definitely not right. Anna is supernaturally strong, has peculiar insights into the souls of the men accompanying her, and progressively becomes less dirty and disheveled as the film progresses.

Unlike Black Death, Season of the Witch delivers on the promise of a supernatural smack down. The special effects range from very good (the big bad guy at the end) to the passable (the mutated wolves) to the pathetic (at one point, Cage and Perlma have a discussion on supposed horseback in front of an obvious green screen).  There's no rhyme or reason to the actors' accents. Season of the Witch makes almost no attempts at coherent dialogue. It's a low-budget film with a FX gloss.

But if you can look past that, Season of the Witch is basically a medieval version of movies that have trod similar territory; it's not as funny as Evil Dead II and with better special effects than Dylan Dog. It's not that Season of the Witch is terrible, it's just doesn't even try to be good.",1328400000,,2388,4.790754257907542

4442555,5,B004P1IXJ0,"This film was so thoroughly murdered by the critics, that I was not expecting much - but to my great surprise I spend a very pleasant cinema moment!

As you probably already know the main plot is about two former crusaders, a noble knight Behmen (Nicholas Cage) and a simple warrior Felson (Ron Pearlman), who, after running in trouble with the Church, are pardoned but asked to perform one more service - escort an alleged witch, a young girl named Anna (Claire Foy) to the remote abbey where she can be tried. The journey begins in what seems to be western Austria and is quite long and dangerous as the travelers must cross the Alps and some particularly wild forests to reach the abbey of Severac which seems to be somewhere in northern Switzerland or southern Alsace.

The reason for this journey is that the whole country is stricken by an incredibly deadly epidemic - in fact it is the beginning of THE Black Death of 1348-52, which was going ultimately to kill half of the population of the whole Europe! The Cardinal d'Ambroise (Christopher Lee) who sends the two ex-crusaders in this mission is himself dying of plague. The Church considers Anna responsible for the epidemic, as she was seen around most of the places where the disease began - she also is supernaturally strong and speaks often in tongues nobody have ever heard off. The Church hopes that the monks of Severac, who own a large collection of secret books advising how to remove curses and expel demons, will be able to deprive the witch of her power and put an end to the plague, which is every day killing hundreds of people.

Behmen and Felson will not go alone - they are joined by a young Inquisitor, Father Debelzaq (Stephen Campbell Moore), a local knight Eckhart (Ulrich Thomsen) who lost his wife and children to the plague and a swindler and thief, Hagamar (Stephen Graham) who knows well the way to Severac and for this reason is pardoned and send on the quest. The group will be joined later by a young altar boy Kay (Robert Sheehan), who, being of noble birth prefers to become a warrior rather than to be a seminarist. Once the group is complete, the quest can begin...

There are many reasons why I liked this movie and one of them is that it really reminded me of some good moments I spend playing Dungeons and Dragons! The group of adventurers seems coming straight from an ADD adventure - there is a Paladin (Behmen), three Warriors (Felson, Eckhart and kay), one Priest (Debelzaq) and one Thief (Hagamar). The whole quest combines a good mixture of wilderness, city and underground (dungeon) adventures and there is a good deal of hazards, riddles, black magic and even some monsters... And the whole thing is very professionally mixed, with some nasty surprises and not silly at all!

Nicholas Cage is a very good actor (he however sometimes plays in very bad movies) and he did very well in this one. Stephen Campbell Moore is also very convincing as Inquisitor Father Debelzaq, but the best performances were those of Ron Pearlman, Claire Foy and the young Robert Sheehan. The atmosphere in places like a plague stricken medieval burg, the high Alps, the dark Wormwood Forest and finally the dungeons of Severac was very well made! One of the things that I liked the most was the appearance of people in the towns - although the streets were muddy and dirty and people wore practical sturdy and not very colorful clothes (the best clothes being reserved for Sunday or other special days), they did not have dirty faces and they did not look retarded or sick (except of course those who were stricken by the Black Death). I really do not know why so many directors consider that every person in a medieval town must have a dirty face and/or a look like he/she was issued from ten generations of consanguinity! Dominic Sena escaped this trap with grace and the result is quite credible.

Another thing that I liked was the approach of the Church and especially the character of the priest Debelzaq. In a lesser movie the political correctness would ask that he be the main scoundrel and the real villain - in this movie things are much much much more complicated and the final solution of the movie is a very unexpected one. For sure, the horror of witches hunt is not blunted in this movie (although in real history the real epidemic of witch hunt took place AFTER the Middle Age was over, in XVI and XVII century!) and there is one scene of execution of an innocent young woman which is absolutely horrible - but the other face of the Church is also shown in this movie, by the devotion of Cardinal d'Abroise and also many others priests and monks who try to o their duty in the time of unprecedented cataclysm without any regard for their own safety and until their last breath.

Last but not least - the ending of the movie is quite good - I was moved by it and I really did not expect it happen, when going to see it. Which is even more surprising, my wife was moved by it too - and she is not anywhere as forgiving (or as much into fantastic adventures) as I am...

Now of course it is only a movie without much more ambition than to distract, so one should not try to see too much in it and it is certain that in this film Christianity itself is shown as a kind of more organized witchcraft, which is ludicrous as Jesus himself strictly forbid to play with magic as a blasphemy against the first commandment and warned that any people who claim having some kind of ""powers"" are just charlatans. The scene in which a Catholic priest performs a kind of weird ritual to make certain that a hanged and drowned witch will not raise from the dead is perfectly ridicule and a horrible blasphemy! Any Inquisitor playing this kind of esoteric nonsense would find himself in serious risk of prosecution for heresy!

Also, be advised that most of the the battles mentioned in the beginning of the movie are pure invention! There never was a siege of Tripoli in 1334, there never was a ""battle of Imbros"" in 1337, there never was a ""battle of Artah"" in 1339. On another hand, the siege and capture of Smyrne in 1344 by troops raised by the Pope Clement VI is authentic - although this army was not made of sensu stricto crusaders. In fact the real Crusades ended in 1291, long time before the Black Death (1348-1352), with the last crusader fortress, Saint-Jean d'Acre, taken by the Muslims. The director and the author of the scenario needed however two former crusaders for this movie in time of the Black Death, so they bended a little bit the history - but considering the final result I am tempted to give them the absolution...)))

To conclude, I advise you not to believe the critics (or the reviewers for that matter) and give this movie a fair trial. If you find it wanting, you can hang it, drown it or even burn it at stake, and that most probably with the benediction of the Church... ))) But if you like fantastic adventures, you could really find it quite entertaining - I certainly did!",1327017600,,6991,4.5500794912559615
4442556,3,B004P1IXJ0,"Overall, not a bad film, but not everything I had hoped for.
Season of the Witch is about two warriors that, against the Church's orders, leave the crusades after taking part in the killing of innocent women and children. To be pardoned from their crime of abandonment, they are ordered to transport a witch accused of spreading the Black Plague to a monastery where she can be stripped of her evil powers.
I'll admit that the movie was interesting and it kept me intrigued throughout the entire journey. The movie felt like a mediator between&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Crucible/dp/0142437336/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Crucible</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Van-Helsing/dp/B0002KVUKM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Van Helsing</a>, sporting a very deceptively mind-twisting villain with some fantastical creatures and action scenes thrown in. The special effects were convincing (minus a few jumpy slow-motion effects) and the art direction of the film was very well conceived. While the acting was good,the movie should have been played out more like a thrilling drama and less like an action film. The intense scenes of the film were well done and enough to keep you on edge. So, overall not a bad ride.
On the other hand, the characters weren't engaging enough for me to care what happened to them, there were some very predictable moments, the ""redshirts"" were pretty obvious, there were a few loopholes that made me grind my teeth a bit, and the climax of the film was a bit of a put-off. So, it was about half and half. The film was fun, but don't expect a great movie.

**Spoiler Alert**
Considering the title of the film and the build-up (is she or isn't she?), I was disappointed when the girl turned out to be a demon instead of a witch in the end. We've had plenty of exorcism movies as of late and we haven't had a good witch movie in a while. I was sad when it stopped echoing The Crucible and started retelling&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mummy/dp/B00000JQB5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mummy</a>.
Considering that the demon was incredibly evil and killed those that stopped it from reaching its destination (how the characters suddenly deduced this plot was a bit rough), why did it save the altar boy? Demons don't feel charity and the boy had no real purpose in the journey; as a matter of fact, he wasn't even supposed to be there. What made the demon suddenly decide to save this useless boy? Didn't make sense to me.
I laughed at the final words of the film. After the demon was exorcised and the girl was herself again, minus any clothing, she tells the altar boy that she has no recollection of her heroes or the journey. Then, as they ride off into the sunset, her voice-over explains that most people will think the plague was a passing virus and that she will spread the truth because she was there! She just said she had no idea what had happened!
Also, they talk about needing more Holy Water and then go on a search to find it... and then never use it.

The movie is wrought with violence ranging from battle scenes to hangings. Pretty violent stuff. Because the film deals with the Bubonic Plague, there are a lot of disturbing images of the victims.

Starring in roles ranging from bad cop (Snake Eyes) to treasure hunter (National Treasure) to un-dead rider (Ghost Rider), Cage has finally reached the role of Crusading knight in this 2011 box-office bomb.  Also starring Ron Perlman and Christopher Lee, this movie tries to be a supernatural action thriller with sword fights, evil wolves, witches, and a brutal fight to the finish with the devil and raised spirits.  However, all of this was quite cliche as every scene seem copied from a previous movie.  The night when the wolves attack was all too similar to scenes from the second Underworld movie.  The bridge crossing reminded me of a similar scene in Shrek.  And the women actually being possessed by the devil; well that was seen in numerous movies about exorcisms.  The only new part was Perlman's gallows humor (literally) as a sidekick knight.  The DVD contains nothing special; no extended edition or alternate ending.

The scar the possessed monk made on his eye is a trademark on Geralt's (The Wticher) face and is made with a hook looking exactly like the one Geralt uses to carry hs monster trophies.

The movie deserves 3.5 stars. Despite some acting flaws(due to lack of direction) and so clunky dialogue the overall movie is fine with a somewhat cohesive plot. The beginning is done carelessly and it's the worse part of the movie. The rest is fine. Pearlman is the only one who is in complete control. The younger member of the cast should do a second part where he hunts demons. He is definitively crafting his way.

Nick Cage it's good as the hero but he could feel a little more. He is one of my favorite actors of all time. But I think as anyone else, his ego from pass successes has gotten on his own way and acting.",1320796800,,964,4.35

Their party also features a few other characters, and naturally, things don't go particularly well on their journey.  Let it first be said that Season of the Witch is nowhere near as bad as I thought it would be when I first caught wind of it.  Cage and Perlman are good in their roles, but the unbelievably predictable script (granted the bit of a twist towards the end is a surprise) and overly brisk pace don't help matters any.

It's something of a buddy road picture set in 14th century Europe with supernatural elements that become more and more apparent as the tale progresses. Perlman seems to fit into his role better than Cage but Cage still has the name so he gets star casting I suppose. Yes that's the voice of Christopher Lee but I won't say which costumed person he is so you have to figure it out. Nice nod to the historically inaccurate Key of Solomon. The setting is grim to say the least but well executed. Based on a spec script purchased by MGM in 2000. This picture had some distribution issues between competing minds yet still yielded close to $90M at the Box Office. It cost $40M to make. European castles and the like were used as models. This feels like a well done ""B"" film in some cases and it seems intentional. Cage explained his interest in doing this film as such, ""I wanted to make movies that celebrated actors like Christopher Lee and Vincent Price, and the great Roger Corman classics that are unafraid to explore the paranormal and the supernatural.""

4442583,2,B004P1IXJ0,"I love movies about anything occult, and I generally like Nicholas Cage (although the material he's been doing lately has been weak), so I was prepared to like this one, but just couldn't. First of all, based on the marketing description I thought it would be more about innocent women being falsely accused of witchcraft by the medieval Church (as so many healers, midwives, and intuitives were), with Nicholas Cage playing a gallant Knight coming to their rescue. Instead the movie initially plays into every negative stereotype of witch-hood perpetrated by the Church, including blaming one for the entire Black Plague. Then it decides (**semi-spoiler alert**) that it's actually a demon possession movie, and tries to be the Exorcist (it fails.) Along the way it takes a stab at being a buddy movie - Ron Perlman plays Cage's fellow knight, and they attempt some Lethal Weapon-style partner banter - but that falls flat. Most of the dialogue and acting is at best adequate and at worst dreadful.

At a certain point I was only watching the movie so that I could responsibly review it (I never review unless I have watched the entire thing.) The only reason I went with 2 instead of 1 star is that 1) some of the special effects were decent, and 2) some of the psychological themes of how darkness operates (in terms of using each individual's doubts or shame against them) were semi-interesting (although not original - Harry Potter does a better job, frankly.)

4442591,4,B004P1IXJ0,"After reading many Amazon reviews, I really did not expect much from this film.  Much to my surprise it was really quite good.  Most of the production values were fairly high. Some of the filming is really quite beautiful. Only a small part of CGI towards the end looked cheap (and at that it was more in the background).
Cage and Perlman played very well off of each other.  They were both believable as the characters they were playing--war weary disenchanted
knights, who just wanted to go home after years of fighting. After a particular incident, they have lost all faith in the Crusade.  Unlike other reviewers statements indicate, neither they nor their group of fighters in the Crusade were shown (or even hinted at)engaged in ANY rape, pillage or plunder.  I am not making a political stance about the Crusades, just commenting on the actual film being discussed.  The story is overall quite dark with some believable dark humor between Cage and Perlman. Their relationship comes across as quite earthy.  They are two seasoned warriors, who have already survived much together before the story at hand even begins.  The acting overall is very decent.  No actor, European or American used anything other than their native accent.  Cage himself was quite toned down in acting like Cage.  He was into the character, a strong yet introspective honorable warrior now racked with guilt over what he had done in the Crusade he engaged in.  Keep an ear out for Christopher Lee, as his advanced state of Plague leaves him almost totally unrecognizable.
I think some of the negative feeling for the film is its graphic portrayal of the Plague.  The overall tone is really quite grim. The film also does not fit into any one category.  It is neither really an adventure or strictly a horror film.  While none of the individual elements of the story are original, this combination comes across as fairly fresh.  The big revelation towards the end is a nice twist. This is coming from a very cynical person who has seen a LOT of horror movies.

4442602,3,B004P1IXJ0,"This movie was not as bad as many claim ............. but ............ uhmmmm ........... I can see why the critics were harsh.  Something does not work here.

I am always hesitant to criticize something when I know how much hard work went into making it.
After all, it is much easier to be a critic, than to actually create something.
So I always fall back to the adage that it is too easy to sit back and criticize other people's work and efforts -- but what have YOU ever created ???

The premise of this movie was good.
You can see much work went into it.
It was entertaining for 100 minutes.
But it never really comes together and is very forgettable.

What went wrong ?

The movie gives me the same feeling I had watching Kevin Costner play Robin Hood.
Cage and Perlman seem out of place and time.

I always say you know you are watching a well made movie when even for a brief moment you are pulled into the film and forget it is a movie.
But that does not happen with this movie.
The whole time it feels like modern people, wearing old time outfits trying to look like ancient times, walking thru sets and CGI screens acting a part.

The screenplay also seemed disjointed as though the film went thru a lot of trouble to me made and went thru years and years of re-writes by different people.

The movie also shifts moods and tones.  This may be a symptom of the problem I mentioned above about the film taking a long time to be made and going thru many re-writes.

It starts with a dark and serious tone.
Then at times it becomes kind of goofy and comical.
etc.....etc.....etc.....
It is almost as though there was a fight behind the scenes with different producers as to what type of movie they were trying to make.

So, it left us with a strange love/hate feeling when it was over.

You never felt Cage and Perlman were really in character.
They seemed out of place in these roles, and you only saw the actor -- not the character.
It has been said that people either like or dislike Cage.
Personally, we usually like him ........ but it did not seem he was really into making this movie.
It seemed he was only doing the movie out of a need for income or something --- hard to explain, but it seemed Cage was just going thru the motions and privately disliked this project.

The story seemed a bit forced and unfocused (rewrites ??)

It was clear that much work went into making the film, and we wanted to like it more.

Sadly the final battle scene also fails. The director uses the fast choppy editing that is in vogue now.  I suppose young directors think that choppy, accelerated strobe like editing is supposed to add tension, but all it does is make things hard to see.  Unfortunately the revealed evil entity looks a bit comical like something from a video game. Perhaps old fashioned techniques would have beat CGI here.

In the final analysis ......... it was entertaining enough that we wanted to finish watching it to see the whole story ............. BUT ............ it is not a film we would watch again or consider buying on DVD.",1315180800,,3054,4.403914590747331

4442604,2,B004P1IXJ0,"Nicholas Cage and Ron Perlman are Behman and Felson, 14th-century ex-Crusaders tired of the bloody battles, who must deliver a ""witch"" (so they are told) from a plague-infested village to a faraway monastery. As you know, their journey with four travelers - a priest, a knight, a small-time crook serving as a guide and an altar boy who wants to be a knight - is fraught with danger, some of which is of a supernatural nature. Besides, the young woman they have to transport (Claire Foy, ""Little Dorrit"" of the 2008 BBC mini-series), is, as it turns out, no ordinary girl.

After the shaky and lengthy introductory chapters, the film's story really gets started when The Cardinal in his deathbed (cameo played by Christopher Lee, hardly recognizable) asks Behman and Felson to escort the young girl accused of witchcraft to a trial that will be held in a remote monastery. The premise is contrived, but good enough for a decent grade B action adventure movie, which ""Season of the Witch"" is trying to be.

Sadly director Dominic Sena (a 2000 film ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" starring Nicholas Cage) fails to deliver anything new into the film's weak storyline. Action set-pieces including a rope bridge and sword fight are clichd; characters are flat and uninteresting; and though production designs are decent, special effects in the film's denouement leaves much to be desired.

Some critics (including Roger Ebert) point out that ""Season of the Witch"" is strongly influenced by ""The Seventh Seal"" (1957). Is it? I don't know, not having seen the Ingmar Bergman's classic yet, but to me the new film looks more like a modest-budget adaptation of some video game.

She's also accused of starting the Bubonic Plague.

The Girl's super-human strength and several inexplicable events she seems to initiate with her mind can only mean this unfortunate is actually possessed by Satan, but our heroes don't learn that until after they reach the devil's desired destination, and then all you-know-what breaks loose.

If you want a heartfelt treatise that examines the nobler and gentler side of demons and devil worship, plagues and pestilence then there is nothing here for you.  Put your Athame up, and cast your maledictions elsewhere.

Before getting into the plot, the film has a brilliant sound track and some of the best medieval trappings in terms of clothing, accouterments, and scenery that I have seen in a movie.

Warning!  Beyond this point, there lies spoilers!

Nicolas Cage (Behmen) and Ron Perlman (Felson), two B-Movie giants, team up to play a pair of disaffected Templars fighting in the crusades.  The movie plays to the commonly held, contemporary view that the crusades were not about religion at all.  A disgusted Cage and Perlman desert God's army and head home.

So far, it is the plot of 500 movies (including recent revisionist versions of Robin Hood).

Ah!  That is when the writer, Bragi Schut, throws his first plot twist.  Behmen and Felson are recognized in a town and captured as deserters.  Nicely played Sir!  That is a likely occurrence.  Unlike many of the recent movies that play the townspeople of the Middle Ages as secular humanists; the townspeople were in fact typically quite devoted to the church and would have turned in deserters from the Holy War.

The duo is accosted by a dire Christopher Lee playing a cardinal dying of the plague.  The cardinal has discovered that the plague has been caused by a witch; he wants Behmen and Felson to escort the witch to a monastery that has a copy of a sacred text, the Key of Solomon.

The pair is accompanied by an altar boy who wants to be a knight, a priest, a hired hand of the cardinal, and a merchant/guide.

Director Dominic Sena does an excellent job of dropping enough hints about the truth behind the witch to make the final plot twist a reasonable revelation.

The group takes on rotten bridges, haunted forests, and plague filled villages.

On the way to the monastery, the party loses its hired hand and merchant.

When the group arrives at the monastery, the witch reveals itself to actually be a demon!

The demon has been systematically destroying copies of the Key of Solomon for the past several hundred years.  The copy at the monastery is the last.

An epic melee occurs, and good triumphs over evil.  The plague is lifted.  Behmen and Felson have their faith in the church restored and die heroes.

Turns out that demons are bad.

In addition to the well-done aspects of the movie already mentioned, there are two more points that make this a great buy.

First, the extras on the DVD are very good.  The deleted scenes are especially insightful, but they would have made for a different movie.  I liked both versions.

Second, the banter between Felson and Behmen is extremely well-done.  As a combat veteran, I could imagine brothers in arms saying the quips that the two made, e.g., ""not bad for a dungeon,"" ""forget the souls, I'll take some chicken,"" etc.

All in all, it would be an excellent addition to any B-grade film fan's library.

In service,

Rich

4442628,4,B004P1IXJ0,"Season of the Witch was an entertaining watch. Nicholas Cage seems to have a penchant for supernatural-themed dramas and delivers more of the same here. Cage plays a Knight of the Crusades, Behmen, a warrior at ease on the battlefield and loyal to the Church, until an incident that causes him to turn his back on the cause and desert from the Crusades. He is accompanied by faithful brother-in-arms, Felson (Ron Perlman). The pair stop to rest at a little village beset by the Black Death, the plague, and are arrested when someone recognizes the symbol on Behmen's sword. When a local priest, Debelzaq (Stephen Campbell Moore) sees them, he brings them to the dying Cardinal who is also suffering the effects of the plague. Cardinal D'Ambroise (whom I recognized immediately as Christopher Lee, despite the awful make-up - boils and all) offers the disgraced knights a chance at redemption - to accompany a young girl accused of witchcraft to a remote monastery, where she will be put on trial.

Behmen initially refuses and lands both himself and his friend in the dungeon. But he reconsiders after witnessing the young girl's suffering. The rest of the story focuses on the perilous journey to the monastery, and the strange events that plague the travelers along the way. Behmen finds himself questioning his earlier convictions about the young woman when he witnesses some startling things. Is the girl a pawn in a sinister Church conspiracy, is she a witch, or are there other darker forces at work?

The acting was sufficiently credible, despite some cringe-inducing dialogue. Cage delivers his signature brooding performance with monosyllabic lines. Perlman is adequate as Cage's sidekick, another actor who seems pigeon-holed into the same roles, over and over. The stand-out performance here was the young accused witch, Claire Foy. Her acting was downright chilling, moving back and forth between naive innocent and evil witch. The other credible performance was by the actor portraying a young wannabe knight, Kay (Robert Sheehan).

This medieval drama will appeal to fans of the genre and those who like supernatural, good vs. evil type stories. There's lots of CGI here, but not to the extent of dwarfing the plot. It made for an entertaining evening's watch.",1312588800,,2274,5.074866310160428

If the director would only re-edit the film to include most of the cut scenes from the BD, I'd buy it again.  As is, the replay value is pretty low without a more poignant, better developed story.",1312329600,5,702,4.9743589743589745

All in all, this was a decent movie, with a decentish story. My biggest gripe with the story was the fact that the witch trials of medieval Europe are, apparently, justified, as there really were horrible, evil, nasty witches masquerading as regular villagers. And, no, that's not really a spoiler -- this is all revealed in the opening scene. I realize that this is fiction and entertainment...but depicting the paranoia and brutality of the Inquisitors, who tortured, murdered and terrorized for hundreds of years, as just is something on par with a film suggesting that Hitler was on to something. There are a handful of episodes in human history that stand out for their wanton cruelty and savagery, and the terror of the witch trials, and the Inquisitions that spawned them in many parts of the world, is such an example; to use as a basis for your film the ludicrous accusations that saw thousands upon thousands brutally tortured, burnt, drowned, and otherwise murdered, is rather appalling.

That aside, however, the film was still pretty decent. It was by no means a work of art or genius, but it wasn't a waste of time, either. It was interesting, and worth watching, provided you have nothing better lying around. The story kept your attention, and progressed at a quick enough pace. The characters were interesting enough, if uninspired, and the scenes were not bad. As with the rest of it, the acting was decent. It was nothing superb -- this is a Nicholas Cage movie, let's remember -- but it was not bad, either.

All in all, I rate this 3/5 stars, despite the fact that it suggests that one of the most brutal, misogynistic campaigns in human history was justified -- it's a decent movie, and silly enough to lessen the plot's shortcomings",1312156800,,1926,4.70919881305638

You've read the synopsis within the included reviews so lets revel in the beautiful photography by Amir Mokri with a little help from the great Dante Spinotti and the seeping music score mixing epic and religious motifs by Atli Orvarsson which raises the level of the film light years ahead of similar excorcism releases cluttering the screens lately.  Director Sera peppers his film with excellent set pieces such as a chase through a burial ground maze, a harrowing moving-across-a-rickety- bridge-into-endless-chasm sequence reminiscent of Director William Friedkin's 'SORCERER'-1977, and the excellent seige by wolf pack in the creepy forest of Worm Wood which looks like it was shot in a real forest and emerges as a hommage to Italian Director Mario Bava (it's just that good). The film was shot in Hungary and Salzburg, Austria and it shows giving it spots of fairy tale aspects and Hammer Horror gothics with even an unrecognizable Christopher Lee in a cameo as a plague ridden Cardinal. Although the climax is bogged down with the usual CGI shenanigans, the film has a few surprises up its sleeve till the closing credits.  The film is released by 20th Century Fox's Rogue Films in a beautiful 1.85 Dolby Digital Surround transfer including deleted scenes, an alternate ending which rarely is the better choice but in this case they should have went with the alternate which fuses and completes the plot without CGI monsters and razzle dazzle effects , and 2 behind the scenes featurettes.

He brought that dead character he always plays to this film with him.  Strike one against the film.  Ok to start the movie the language in several areas of the film were ""modern speak.""  Which threw the movie off. I did not expect old English, but modern speak is just as bad. Strike two against the film.  And in typical fashion the ""witch"" was a girl around 18-23 which the characters (which were all male) felt sorry for.  Really?? Is there nothing new that can be written, but a bunch of older men taking a young woman to prison and feeling so sorry for her so they want to ""save her"".  Strike three this movie is out!

The movie started with at least a good premise:  the church (of course) is hanging women left and right because they are supposedly witches, after they coerce them into false confessions.  It seems there's a passage from the book of Solomen (who knew?) that will keep their evil souls from coming back, but this incantation is not read quick enough for one.  Whatever happened to her, I haven't a clue.

Fast forward and we see Nick Cage and Ron Pearlman fighting the good fight for the church (called the Crusades), slaughtering innocent men, women, and children--and then going BAR HOPPING and womaniziing.  (That old church--sets such a good example).  They go AWOL and...ah, hell, never mind. I already have a headache from just explaining this much of the movie.

To say this movie was awful would be an understatement.  There is no character development for anybody; people appear to play a part, and then are killed for whatever reason.  Watching this poor attempt at movie-making, I thought I was actually watching a movie that was produced by (and for) the SyFy Channel.  It was that bad.

I understand this movie was a ""hit"" in Europe.  That's just sad.  Rated PG 13 and lasting a day and a half, I'd rather jump naked from a 12-foot ladder into a bathtub of porcupines than have to watch this again.",1311811200,12,1517,4.693181818181818

The CGI work adds to the story in all respects, and delivers an appropriate amount of shivers. The sound design supplements the ambience, and at points, the Eerie feel is just great. Very definitely a good scare and if you are familiar with some period occult lore, this will give you plenty of thought in the mythos. In that respect, The deleted scenes are almost totally uncalled for, since all the deleted scenes added to all the key characters in great detail. The final scenes are the biggest
payoff and are hugely chilling; I just loved what happened, and would encourage anyone who loves nuanced style in Supernatural scares to watch a very good work.

After seeing the trailers and watching the first couple minutes of the movie, I wondered, ""How could this movie be bad?""  To begin with, it is slow-moving, and after only the first 20 minutes or so I gave up watching.  I was brought back shortly thereafter and was back in time to see the travelers reach their destination and witness the big twist in the plot.  Which, to me, was terrible.  That twist was akin to making the bad guys look good after all-- as if the witch hunts of the past were somehow validated all along!  It was a huge letdown since I'd been rooting for the witches the time.  Also, the dialogue is so cliche, it sounds like it came out of a D&D book!  I know because it's an historical fiction, their language could be a little on the formal side, but that doesnt mean it had to be contrived as well.  I was also hoping for more of the CGI, but the physical results of the Plague were more detailed and interesting than the supernatural creatures in the movie.

Anyway, the PG-13 rating appears to be for some war violence and scary imagery meaning that it was okay for my 12 year-old to watch, but my 8 year-old would have been freaked out by the scary stuff.

4442661,3,B004P1IXJ0,"I felt I had to write a review after watching this one to defend it from the trashing it is getting. The story unfolds with 3 women being accused of witchcraft. They are drowned and the priest comes back on his own to do a last rites/ritual to make sure they stay dead. One doesn't. Cut to the crusades where Nick and Ron become aware that some of the killing they are being forced to do may not be in God's name, so they go AWOL. The black plague is raging, a scapegoat is needed, a young girl is accused and forced to confess. The cardinal? is infected and makes a deal with the two. If they will escort the girl, a priest and a man who lost his entire family to the plague to a far off bunch of monks, the two will be pardoned. They engage the help of a guide who is rescued from the stocks by them in return for guide job. They need to reach the monks in hope that a sacred book with an ancient ritual will remove the curse of the plague that the girl has confessed to releasing on the kingdom. Along the way they realize that an altar boy who hopes to prove his worthiness to become a knight is following them and he joins them for the perils that follow. All is not as it seems. Is the girl a witch or not. Now the review: I figured out the plot twist halfway through the movie. The scares were contrived and could be seen coming from a mile away. The plot dragged at points but it WAS necessary to get all of the elements of the story told. As a result, this movie is NOT for everybody. I firmly believe that half of the bad reviews were given by people who expected to see constant non stop action and are used to only movies that provide that. This IS a movie worth watching because the sets, locations, and CGI are well done and provide a breath taking visual experience in between the required dark spooky scenes. I wanted to know HOW they dealt with the plot twist I had seen coming and how the story would unfold. The rest of the story is strictly a good versus evil plot that is well told and with ONE last twist... the reveal of which would tell too much, that I did NOT see coming. Would I buy it new? No. I paid for a rental here at Amazon. Will I purchase a good used copy for my collection? Probably.

They are given orders to take a witch, believed to be responsible for the town's woes, to a group of monks living off in the mountains.

With another prisoner, a petty thief, as their guide and a few others, they set off with the witch in a cage-like wagon.  They are soon attacked by wolves and the witch escapes.  But even more mystery and danger falls upon the group as they reach the home of the monks and discover who the witch really is.  A battle of good against evil ensues.

Dark special effects and a tad bit of mystery make this a decent movie to watch.  However, the plot lacks a lot of depth.  Most of the characters are useless and you know they are each going to be picked off soon.  The ""happy ever after"" ending is a bit contrived and predictable.  Nicolas Cage is well, Nicolas Cage, although I did enjoy Ron Perlman in this one. The best overall was probably Claire Foy who plays the unnamed witch.

Since the movie suffers from a lack of plot, its no wonder that the movie is so short.  It all gets wrapped up in just 95 minutes.  A decent rental if there's nothing better to watch.

I'm just glad I wasn't expected to remember any of it.  As it was, it took some time to realize this was their way of marking time, letting us see the toll it takes on the two main characters.  Unfortunately, these brief scenes never paused long enough for it to register that years were passing.  I kept thinking I was much better off on the bridge with the three accused witches and that dopey priest, at least that demonstrated some context with the piece.  (This is exactly why the Inquisition and the Crusade got such bad reps.)  Anyway, so much carnage later, Behman von Bleiruck (Nicolas Cage) has an epiphany, oddly enough while killing some poor girl, that maybe he wasn't cut out for this line of work after all.  Oh sure, NOW he figures that out!  He and his sidekick (Ron Perlman) decide to hit the road only to find things aren't exactly fun anywhere, there's plague afoot or foul, what's a deserter supposed to do?  That's when they meet the only other recognizable actor in this piece (Christopher Lee); only in this case, not so recognizable.  A bargain is struck, a traveling party picked, their mission: get an accused witch to the monks at some out-of-the-way monastery.  Sounds simple enough.  Of course, it doesn't take long before things go awry and there's dissension in the ranks, not everyone makes it to the monastery.  Everything finally comes down to THE book and being able to read THE correct passage from it.
I'm almost ashamed to admit I liked it....a lot.
Why?  Well, if you ignore the fact that Nicolas Cage is THE star, you might see it in a better light.  I kept thinking what was throwing things off kilter and came to the rapid conclusion that it was Cage who was mucking things up.  There's absolutely no conviction in his (here I hesitate) performance.  It was painfully obvious at the outset that he was doing this just for the money.  In that regard, I hope he was well paid.  I don't think, however, that they should have paid him for just sleepwalking through his role.  He's like a dead weight around poor Ron Perlman's neck (in this case, a more reliable actor than Cage, Oscar notwithstanding).  Perlman's a trooper.  I kept my attention on him and his snarky way of delivering even the worst lines and making them funny.  So he got his name below the title, it's to his credit that he gave his all (and always has).  There are actors who give their all no matter what the work is because they have some pride in their craft.  Perlman knows this; sadly, Cage doesn't, and has delivered a lot of mediocre performances in his career.  (Worse than not really trying, Cage actually looks embarrassed from time to time, as though he was about to apologize for what he was doing.)
That aside, I liked this movie in spite of the fact that Nicolas Cage was in it.  I can easily see watching it again, as a double feature night, with something better following it.  I'm glad I bought it, I'm keeping it.",1309824000,4,3128,4.547406082289803

It had good special effects, had some great historical research put into it. And I was surprised how clean it was; No sex, no nudity, hardly any language. Most movies now days are packed with that sort of thing, in order to cover up a lack of a plot. Maybe that's why so many people said the plot was poorly developed. Compared to most, I thought the plot was pretty good. I would definitely recommend it.

All in the hope that the monks at the abby can determine her guilt or innoncence; and save the world from the plague in the process; the girl is thought to be the cause of the plague.

The two Knightts are joined on their journey by another Knight who lost his daughter to the plague, a priest, an alter boy, and a crocked mechant who acts as their guide.  On their journey to the abby, they face numerous perils; all while learning more about the innocence or guilt of the accused witch.

There are a couple of great twist at the end, and enough action throughout to keep you engaged. Cage and Perlman, in my opinion, are never really believable in period pieces....it's their accents...or lack there off, that distracts from the character.  I actually think the minior characters are the ones that make this movie a 4 star...some decent acting among this bunch.

For those concerned about violence...well, the film does have quite a bit of violence....however, its not very gory.  I think its ok for 13 year olds and older; and the film does contain some religious themes, but is far from preachy.

4442680,3,B004P1IXJ0,"Season of the Witch had all the elements of a great film - great premise, solid cast and Nicholas Cage is in form.  The on screen pairing with Ron Perlman completely works too.  So what gives?  The movie starts off intriguingly - with a mix of buddy chemistry and an ominous mission with a Lord of the Rings tinge to it.

As the movie develops however, somehow the ending - while not bad - kind of gives way to a slam-bang special effects scenario.  In short, the stakes should've been way higher - and scarier.  Still, Season of the Witch is a decent film to watch - Cage looks good as a Knight - and the film is eminently watchable (way better than the Brothers Grimm, the Highlander sequels and many other films).

I thought this movie would be a more ""is she or isn't she"" a witch to it. Imagine my disappointment when it turns into Brave Knights vs Evil Nights. I think my main problem was the rating on this movie PG-13? Mmmm nope wouldn't even think of letting my kids watch this.

I thought perhaps I was in store for a bit of a history lesson about the Dark Ages. What irked me most of all is if you are going to do a movie with Biblical undertones for Pete sake follow it through. Okay fine so the Catholic church back in the day got a bit up n up and waged a religious war. Got that. Ok so there is a book that helps priest perform exorcisms. Got that too. So far following the undertones, but for anyone who knows squat about the Catholic church and the Bible....well they know that one demon isn't going to cause a mass plague thus ending the world.

After that it was just a bit hard to enjoy. And I was upset the main characters died. That bugged me. You fight demons, you should at least get out of it alive enough to have that final drink and whoop it up in the pub. Poor unsung heroes. :P",1309392000,5,1112,4.091743119266055
4442685,4,B004P1IXJ0,"Nicolas Cage has taken a beating from critics over the past few years. First off due to the number of films he's made in recent years and secondly because they don't live up to the standards enforced by critics who are only interested in Oscar worthy projects for him to star in. The fact is that being an actor isn't just about awards; it's about being employed and working. And Cage always works when he makes a movie no matter what the topic. It's for this reason that his fans love him and why they won't be disappointed with SEASON OF THE WITCH.

Cage plays Behmen, a knight involved in the Crusades when the film opens. Along with his trusted friend Felson (Ron Perlman), they pair carve a path through history surviving one battle after the next serving the Church as it strived to cut a bloody trail through non-believers. After over 10 years the pair has had enough, questioning whether it is truly in God's service they are employed or simply that of an organization who wants control over all they can see. With the death of a young woman on his hands, Behmen and Felson leave and head home.

Problems follow them when they arrive in a small town only to be recognized as deserters. Thrown into a dungeon and waiting trial, they are saved when the Cardinal calls them to see him. Dying of the plague (as are most of the townspeople), he entrusts them with the task of taking a woman accused of being the witch that brought this plague to an abbey where the monks there will hold a trial for her. If found guilty, they will sentence her to death and end the plague.

Accompanying them on this journey is a priest named Debelzaq (Stephen Campbell Moore), another knight named Eckhart (Ulrich Thompson), a guide named Hagamar (Stephen Graham) and an alter boy named Kay (Robert Sheehan). Claire Foy plays ""the girl"" being transported and supposed a witch. But as their journey moves forward you wonder first if it could even be possible that this woman is a witch or simply a person in the wrong place at the wrong time. It seems the entire blame is a result of her showing up as the plague began, not just in this town but another as well. With little more proof than that one wonders why she was even accused.

But Cage took on the job with one demand, that the trial is a fair one and not just someone killed because of convenience. It's a job he takes seriously and one that requires him not to just protect his fellow men in arms but the young woman as well, from various beasts along to road to fellow members on his company.

As the film progresses numerous attacks fall upon the travelers. At one time they are witness to shadows once the girl escapes and leads them on a chase that results in the first death of one of the members. Another falls when a group of wild wolves surrounds the group before they can move to safety. And with each attack the viewer is left wondering if the girl is responsible or not, or does it just seem like she's a witch?

Many have taken to task the end battle of this film that happens in the abbey. I had no problem with it (but won't reveal it here so as to not ruin your viewing). They found it a let down and more often than not because those who hate it wanted more shots taken at religion. In short they wanted a different movie. I suggest they watch BLACK DEATH, another movie concerning the black plague that did just that (and that I wasn't a fan of). But for those who like Cage and Perlman as well, you'll get exactly what you would expect: an enjoyable, entertaining mystery wrapped up in a world of religion and supernatural that keeps you wondering, is she or isn't she?

The effects are satisfying (especially at the end), the photography is great, even more so since much of the film takes place at night or in darkened areas, the directing is steady and the acting takes what could have been cartoon characters and fills them with life. The movie doesn't go out of its way to make it seem like hard core reality, instead relying on the story to tell a tale.

If you like Cage in films like GHOST RIDER and DRIVE ANGRY then you'll find yourself enjoying this film as well. If it's the more serious Oscar hungry actor you're looking for them perhaps not. For me, I always want a film to entertain more than anything else and this one does it in spades.",1309392000,5,4316,4.38625
4442686,3,B004P1IXJ0,"While no one will ever make the mistake of placing 'Season of the Witch' on a list of film classics, it is in my opinion a watchable and overall enjoyable storyline for anyone in the mood for a little something from the sword and sorcery film genre. Nicolas Cage and Ron Perlman are perfect in the role of two dis-illusioned Christian Crusaders who have recently disserted from a war and cause they found to be anything but holy. They make the perfect anti-heroes. The rest of the cast is also surprisingly good. I particularly liked the lovely Claire Foy in the role of the suspected witch. She conveyed a wonderful mix of innocence and evil that brought added depth and atmosphere to the screen and held my interest when I may have otherwise lost focus.

Unfortunately I was taken by the hyped up trailer and paid money to see mediocrity at it's best!!  This film was just a short and curly hair above the crap that cable televison has to offer and it still leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  Obviously Nick Cage is hard up for cash because of late he has made some pretty terrible films that are not worth the DVD it is copied on.  The story is OK but predictable, the acting is lazy and the CGI is less than adequate.  Cage and Perlman are just going through the motions to collect a paycheck and it shows through their acting and lack of british accents.

But can one honestly see GHOST RIDER, NEXT, DRIVE ANGRY or THE SORCERER'S APPRENTICE as ""smart"" choices for Cage?  And now, SEASON OF THE WITCH joins this questionable list.
Cage plays a disillusioned knight who is forced to transport a supposed witch to a remote monastery for a ""trial"".  Joined by an acerbic Ron Perlman, he must deal with dark supernatural forces determined to thwart his mission.
WITCH is pure disposable theatrics, its sole purpose to use flashy FX and set pieces to compensate for its weak script.  Claire Foy is chilling in her role as the witch and the script's sly twist is effective.  But Cage and Perlman's playful banter is not that playful and the forced climax isn't resonant of the movie's tone.

The acting is pretty run-of-the-mill (save Ron Perlman who's goofy antics actually mix well with the movie's overall tone); The actors never ""carry the viewer away"" to another time or place- you never forget you are watching Nick Cage and company instead of a medieval crusaders. Also, the trailer makes the story seem much better than it actually is. The story is paper thin, and the thrills aren't particularly all that thrilling. The movie is disappointing in that the trailer promises so much more than it actually delivers; I would have loved to see a serious, dark, brooding film filled to the brim with actual drama and dread.

The GOOD:
Crass humour and inane dialogue demonstrate that the movie never takes itself too seriously, so niether should the viewer. The plot moves at a break- neck pace, so it's never dull or boring.

While on the voyage they begin to wonder if the prisoner really is a witch.  Has many of you know by now,I am not a Nicolas Cage fan at all.  After the disaster that was ""Drive Angry"" I was less then thrilled about this one.  While the acting was about what you expect from him, the movie could have been worse.  That said, the movie was the most middle of the road, average thing I have seen in a long time.  Besides the ridiculous battle scenes in the beginning there was really no constant action.  They start on a journey to escort the witch, the encounter such dangerous perils as...a bridge (which is a ten minute scene).  The ending comes out of nowhere (reminded me of ""From Dusk Till Dawn) but even that doesn't seem to carry enough excitement.  There are some movies that leave you feeling with a strong opinion and you can't stop talking about them.  Then there are some that you really like but only remember when someone brings them up.  This is the kind that you mostly forget as you are watching and leaves you feeling like you have accomplished nothing.  Overall, not a bad movie, but not a good one.  Really just a nothing movie.

Overview:

This is a movie of epic proportions, think - Lord of Rings, and you will begin to grasp the magnitude of this film in terms of its wide panoramic shots with rugged snow covered mountains with sheer cliffs. The music score is exceptional as well and there are a lot of tense moments as two heroic crusaders take a witch to a distant destination to have her demons expelled.

Background:

The story is derived from the the period of the dark ages, with particular focus on the Black Plague. This would set the film to be in the 1300s. A prelude is given in the year 1235 AD at the City of Villach, here three women convicted of witchcraft are put to death.

Story:

It starts off where 2 crusaders (Nicolas Cage and Ron Perlman) return to their home in Europe after long years of religious wars. These wars started at the Gulf of Edremit 1332, different scenes of battle are shown in 1334, 1337, 1339, and ending in 1344 at Smyrna. Knight Behmen (Cage) is now battle weary and questions his faith because of the harsh battles that he had to endure, as well as the fact that he is now reduced to slaughtering women and children.

However, upon their return, their country is reeling under the hands of another enemy, a deadly plague. Fingers are pointed to a young woman that is believed to be the black witch. However, instead of immediately burning her at the stake, as was common in medieval times, she must be taken to a distant monastery on the edge of nowhere. Knight Beham is now commanded by the moribund Cardinal to deliver a suspected witch to the abbey at this distant location. Here it is believed that monks will have the capability of delivering the young woman of her demons and then in effect releasing the land from the curse of the plague that has gripped it.

This is a suspenceful movie that has a lot of action and tension. Throughout the film you will find yourself wondering if this girl is truly a witch or just a scapegoat to blame. In the end the knights will have to face an evil beyond human comprehension. The final action sequences are quite intense, and reminded me of the old computer game called Heretic.",1307404800,5,2160,4.49234693877551

The priest wants the bodies pulled up from the water so he can perform a ritual on them so they can't return from the dead. As always, resurrected witches have more power than when they were alive. This was all done to show you the ritual book. We jump ahead to 1332 AD with the savoy Nickolas Cage and Ron Perlman fighting in the crusades. After 7 years of rape, killing, pillage and plunder in the name of God's only son, Cage decides this is wrong and calls it quits. Cage and Perlman leave the crusades. Through a series of events, they agree to escort a girl accused of witchcraft, to a group of monks 6 days travel away, so they can judge her. They believe she caused the plague. They get as a guide a man who sold fake church artifacts.

Weird things happen along the way as we suspect the girl really is a witch. The Cardinal had a very distinguished voice, which can be no one other than Christopher Lee, whose career has gone down hill since he was locked away in a Tower. The special effects were good, but the plot lacked. The ending of the story was all wrong and should have related more to the initial 1235 A.D. scene.

4442725,3,B004P1IXJ0,"The best reason for seeing Season of the Witch is partnership between Behmen (Nicholas Cage) and Felson (Ron Perlman). Spoilers follow. Both are crusaders and the film opens with a snapshot of their various battles with a running bet they have that the one who kills the least of the ungodly enemy will buy drinks. This good humored slaughter goes on until one day while laying siege to a town Behmen kills a woman and wants nothing further to do with fighting. Behmen and Felson are outcasts because they have broken their vows to server the church. As they journey home they find that a plague has decimated the country and at the first city they come to the reason for the plague is a girl (Claire Foy) who is said to be a witch. Behmen and Felson are recognized and asked to accompany the witch to a distant monastery for trail, which they do after spending a night in a dungeon. Christopher Lee has a small part as Cardinal D'Ambroise although he is unrecognizable (being a victim of the plague) except for his voice. The journey to see justice occupies the rest of the film as the travelers, led by a merchant who traffics in fake relics (Stephen Graham).

The production is very good with the filth and squalor of the 14th century well represented. The costumes were thoughtfully designed and the special effects are very effective and the makeup used for plague victims was very effective. Nicolas Cage turns in a good but not overly convincing performance; Ron Perlman is easier to see in the role of a crusader. Stephen Campbell Moore (from the Bank Job) does a convincing job playing the priest Debelzag who is determined to see the witch gets her trial. The film has some suspenseful movements, such as when the witch calls up wolves to attack her escort. However, much of the film, such as when the wagon with the imprisoned witch has to cross a crumbling wooden bridge, is predictable.

4442727,4,B004P1IXJ0,"As anyone who knows me is well aware, I'm a self-professed masochist; if there's an opportunity for me to experience something excruciating, I jump at it (keep that in mind, ladies). Obviously, when I saw that Season of the Witch had an abysmal 4% on Rotten Tomatoes, I simply couldn't resist. I quickly found out, however, that I was sort of in the minority on this one (who knew?!)--after petitioning all of my friends, only one was intrepid enough to brave the theaters with me. We planned the trip for early Friday morning, our mounting excitement making Thursday's sleep an ephemeral affair. I awoke that day to an act of God. In his infinite wisdom, he had bestowed upon me a migraine most malicious in an effort to prevent one of his flock from the even greater pain of watching Nicolas Cage play a disillusioned Knight in a fantasy movie.

But I am not a God-fearing man, and so, despite the advice of my friends, despite the admonitions of the critics, despite the wind and the cold and the rain, despite even the divine hand of God himself, I rose from the beanbag chair that was my bed and journeyed forth toward almost certain disappointment. After all, if The Last Airbender, a memory better left forgotten, had received a 7%, what hope did Season of the Witch have? I met Dphil, the intrepid friend, at the gates and handed my ticket to the clerk, who, with his snarling remarks, unkempt hair, and bared teeth, could have (save for the two missing heads) passed for the guardian Cerberus. My companion and I took our seats and surveyed the scene. I have to be honest with you here. It's a little disconcerting when the only other people in the theater are an old man by himself, a huge lady in a squeaky wheelchair being led by a group of friends, and someone who probably rides the short bus and kept babbling and mumbling incoherently. I mean no offense. It was simply an odd crowd.

Season of the Witch is set in England during the Crusadin' times. After a quick intro that proves witches to be all too real, we get a montage of battles in which the knights Behmen (Nicolas Cage) and Felson (Ron Perlman) kill many non-innocents, then finally, after ten years, kill some innocents. Ten years before the first undeserved death? Very impressive. Disillusioned, Behmen and Felson desert the army only to end up in a town ravaged by the plague, which is apparently caused by a hot young vixen who's got this sexy witch vibe goin' on. Setup complete, our two warrior heroes join forces with an elderly knight and the priest Debelzaq (Stephen Campbell Moore), ready to transport the sorceress. At this point, my buddy turns to me and says, ""I can't believe they don't have a rogue in their party!"" Seconds later, Nicolas Cage goes, ""We need a guide!"" and of course the only person who can guide them is the lock-picking ne'er-do-well swindler, Hagamar (Stephen Graham). Dungeons and Dragons team assembled, they set out for an ancient monastery, for only there can the monks cast out the witch and end the plague.

One of the better aspects of Season of the Witch is the way it keeps you guessing. It utilizes the tried-and-true ""Is she a witch or isn't she"" method to keep the audience interested, though I don't understand why the characters never thought to simply compare the girl's weight to that of a duck. Anyway, partway through, it simply tells you the answer. I've tried to craft this review in a similar style. Is Season of the Witch good, or is it not? I guess I've probably been leaning a little too obviously toward the ""not"" side, but the movie has a surprisingly good twist, and so do I. Season of the Witch was actually good! Maybe it was just because anything was better than the pain of a migraine, maybe it was because I was delirious from lack of sleep, or maybe it's because I just can't resist Nicolas Cage's entertainingly unemotional acting, but I enjoyed the hell out of this movie (like how those monks exorcised the hell out of that girl! Get it?).

Sure, it was a little bit predictable in parts, but that just made it more surprising when it caught me off guard. Yes, there was the obligatory bridge-crossing scene, with boards cracking and plummeting below the characters' feet as ropes twisted and frayed, but it was reasonably well done, and, more importantly, it wasn't there just for the sake of unnecessary suspense--the girl saves one of the characters from falling to his death, casting further doubt on her motivations. Yes, witch girl ostensibly summons a bunch of wolves to kill our heroes, but you find out later that there was more at play than you'd ever imagined. The fight scenes were pretty entertaining, I was constantly creeped out by how I was both creeped out by and attracted to the main girl, and unlike stupid The Last Airbender, the movie was surprisingly well paced. Plus, the final battle was pretty awesome. I mean seriously, what's cooler than fighting a horde of cloaked, plague-ridden, undead monks who have boils all over their faces and battle with fearsome hooks in a room that's on fire and filled with shelves of scrolls that go flying whenever someone's thrown into them? All this while a priest epically incants an unnerving Latin ritual in the background, hoping to slay the giant winged demon that seeks to end all human life.

I honestly don't see how this movie got so many negative reviews. The dialogue was a little campy, especially the lines delivered by Hagamar, like ""This damn fog is like a veil before my eyes,"" or directly after, ""I can't see my hand in front of my face."" As clich&eacute; as some of it might have been, Season of the Witch had enough new ideas that, when coupled with a hot girl, some twists and scares, and a general sense of fun, it ended up being well worth the price of a matinee ticket.

Don't just take my word for it, though. I have proof that this was a ""great"" film. You see, I was so totally engaged that I didn't even notice that, by the end of the film, everyone else had walked out! If that's not hard evidence, I don't know what is. The credits rolled and I looked around, extremely pleased that I'd decided to see such a fine film, only to find that there was literally no one in the theater. Had they ever even been there? How could I not hear someone get creakily wheeled out of the room? How could I not notice the babbling babbler leave the theater? Where did the old man go?! I was sure a witch had cursed me. Like I said, it must have been a damn good movie! I'd been looking forward to being able to tear this film apart, but I walked out of the theater perplexed: How was I supposed to write an entertaining review now? Just then, Dphil turned to me, and, as if he could see into my soul, said, ""Russ, you're just going to have to use nuance."" And, as you, the reader, are my witness, this is a review so nuanced that it knows no equal. I braved the wrath of God and more to bring it to you and returned from my quest unharmed (which, for a masochist, is rather disappointing). Someday, I hope to craft a movie of my own with as much nuance and subtlety as Season of the Witch, but until then, I must simply award it:

3.5/5 Stars

Honestly, the worst thing about this movie was the way the sound kept cutting in and out. Perhaps it was another attempt by God to intervene, but I brazenly ignored him, sitting through what seemed like the worst dubbing ever because, darn it, I paid good money for this!

4442729,2,B004P1IXJ0,"""Season of the Witch"" is one of those movies that probably would have gone straight to SyFy/Sci-Fi, if it didn't have an A-list actor attached. It's a murky, rather rushed historical creep-out that blossoms into silly horror at the end, after a long journey where not very much happens. Ron Perlman is awesome, though.

Disgusted with the slaughter of the Crusades, knights Behmen (Nicholas Cage) and Felson (Perlman) desert the army to return home to... somewhere. I think it's England, but I'm not sure.

They arrive in a town infested with the Black Death, and are quickly arrested. But the local bishop (Christopher Lee) offers them a way to clean their slates -- take a witch (Claire Foy) who is blamed for the plague to a distant abbey where she will be depowered courtesy of an ancient spellbook. The embittered Behman doesn't believe she's a witch, but he agrees nevertheless.

Along with a priest, a soldier, a swindler and an altar boy who dreams of knighthood, the two knights take the suspected witch on the perilous journey. But soon Behman starts to suspect that there's something unnatural about her -- she has super-strength, summons wolves, and even makes one man hallucinate right to his death. But no one can guess the horrific truth about what she is until they reach the abbey.

""Season of the Witch"" isn't a horrible film, but it is resolutely mediocre -- it has the feel of a movie where nobody was really trying very hard. In fact, the first three-fourths of the movie just sort of ooze by with lots of dirty medieval villages, spooky hints about the witch girl, and lots of misty forests full of giant wolves.

Even the cameramen and screenwriters aren't trying too hard. It's almost impossible to see what the heck is going on in the fight scenes, except that there are lots of swords and leaves. The dialogue is pretty standard buddy-cop stuff, and is laid out in a hodgepodge of inconsistent accents. Are these Crusaders SUPPOSED to sound so American?

The movie does pick up for about ten minutes when the characters reach the abbey -- storms of darkness, zombie monks, incantations, and a decent Linda Blair impression. The problem is.... we see the bad guy. And it looks RIDICULOUS -- I've seen Star Trek prosthetics that were scarier than that, especially when it starts flitting, scuttling and spinning around the place.

The acting is pretty lackluster -- Cage is phoning in his performance, and most of the supporting characters are so blandly underdeveloped that you can't really care when they get offed. I will say that Stephen Campbell Moore does a decent job as a priest whose faith helps him overcome his fear, and Robert Sheehan and Claire Foy are very earnest in their roles. Oh, and Ron Perlman is lots of fun as Felson. It's pretty obvious he knows he's in a stinker, so he decides to have fun with his laid-back, fun-loving character.

""Season of the Witch"" could have been a semi-decent horror thriller if it had kept the bad guy hidden, but that makes the entire climax fall apart.",1303862400,19,3029,4.7561904761904765
4442730,3,B004P1IXJ0,"Nick Cage. Ron Perlman. An accused witch. The Catholic Church. And the Plague. What could go wrong?

SEASON OF THE THE WITCH is a straightforward tale of two renegade crusaders who have recently begun questioning the church and its warring ways. To avoid prison and death, they are called on to escort a witch to a far-away monastery, where she will stand ""trial"" and then be put to death.  The church has decreed that this young girl has brough the plague to the land, and only her death will end it. Our crusaders are questioning Rome's policy of killing women and children indiscriminantly, and they feel the need to protect the girl.  Of course, things don't go as planned.  Odd behaviours and strange deaths afflict their traveling party, and there is definitely more to this girl than is originally thought.

There's really nothing wrong with SEASON OF THE THE WITCH, except its ordinariness. Acting is good, production values are fine, the special effects are kind a cool, and the story is definitely watchable. But there is nothing compelling about SEASON OF THE THE WITCH.  It is popcorn fare. I like popcorn, but I can't really give it a higher rating when there are so many more creative and captivating movies that cover the same territory.

I like Nicholas Cage, Ron Perlman, and the rest of the cast very much, and you should see this movie.  But wait until SEASON OF THE THE WITCH hits the rental shelves, or better yet, wait until it comes to television.",1303516800,3,1470,4.71484375

I know that there are great actors in this film so how can it be a B-horror film? Well this happens to be a great B-movie. This film wasn't trying to be funny like ""Evil Dead"", but it is similar to that film. It is more serious and is more in the realm of ""Van Helsing"" or more recently ""Wolfman"" with Hopkins and Del Toro. These are old school style films meant for entertaining not to dissect and see what is real or not. I love the old school Universal horror films. This is a modern Universal horror film. They are meant to entertain and enjoy. They are not going to win ""Oscar's"" or even critical acclaim. They are for fans like me who enjoy a great horror film.

I liked the reminder of how important and valuable books were in the middle-ages.  I like the acting.

4442748,4,B004P1IXJ0,"I just got back from the theater after seeing Season Of The Witch.  Let's see...this is the third movie ever made that is called Season Of The Witch or at least has Season Of The Witch as a subtitle (the first was George Romero's 1972 movie called Season Of The Witch and the other is John Carpenter's 1982 movie called Halloween III - Season Of The Witch).

What is this movie about?  To sum up the plot in a nutshell, in the 13th century, there are three women who are thought to be witches.  They are hanged.  A priest drowns them.  One of these witches kills the priest.  Fast forward to the Crusades of the 14th century.  Two knights discover that the Black Plague has devastated their homeland.  It is believed that the Plague was caused by the devil.  A girl is accused of being a witch and she is blamed for causing the Plague.  These two knights take this suspected witch to a monastery far away so they can determine if she really is a witch or not.  If she is indeed a witch, the goal is to destroy her black magical powers so that her curse is lifted and the Plague will end.  Do they accomplish their goal?

This movie stars Nicolas Cage, Ron Perlman, Claire Foy, Stephen Campbell Moore, Robert Sheehan, Stephen Graham, Ulrich Thomsen, and Christopher Lee.

This movie has a really dark atmosphere and feel to it.  You'll see dark castles, forests, overcast skies, fog, etc.  The scenery is very good.  This movie is a good mix of sword and sorcery action, the supernatural, and darkness.  In addition, there is some humor sprinkled in here and there.

This movie had minimal CGI for the first 90% of the movie.  I thought this was a 5-star movie until the last 15 minutes suddenly became a CGI cheesefest.  All of a sudden there was CGI galore and a cheesy CGI demon.  I can't tell you how many movies these days are good, only to suddenly become ridiculous and over the top at the end.  This ending came far from ruining the movie, but it just suddenly felt like a different movie.  Thankfully, the CGI show didn't go on too terribly long.  These last 15 minutes made me lower my rating from 5 stars down to 4 stars.

If you like sword and sorcery/gladiator type of movies with some supernatural elements mixed in, then this is your movie.  I highly recommend it.",1296259200,6,2278,4.43719806763285
4442749,3,B004P1IXJ0,"""Season of the Witch"" (2011) is a buddy movie in which Nicolas Cage (Behmen) and Ron Perlman (Felson) exchange wise-guy, smart-alecky remarks as they slaughter heathens during the 14th century Crusades. You know the drill. Two guys swapping supposed witticisms and gotcha jokes as the blood flows and enemies crumble. They are in the service of the Church, and a priest urges them on to kill the pagans/infidels in the name of God. The producers wisely do not specify the religion of the enemy during the Crusades.
Cage is a full knight, and Perlman is of a lesser rank apparently. Who knows? When they find that they have killed a number of women and children in a siege, Cage decides that he is no longer willing to kill in the service of the Lord, and he and his partner leave the battles behind them--they think.
 The movie begins with the execution of three witches who prove difficult to kill. A priest, Debelzaq (Stephen Campbell Moore), insists on performing rites on the dead who have been hanged and dropped in watery graves, but it isn't easy to destroy their spirits.
A plague is raging everywhere, and the priests believe that witches have brought on the scourge. One young woman has been accused of witchcraft and tortured by Debelzaq, and it is decided that she be taken to a monastery a considerable distance away where the monks can perform a ritual to rid the country of the witch's curse. Cage locks the supposed witch in a wagon cage, and he and five others with the cage wagon containing the girl/witch (Claire Foy) begin the long trek through dangerous wolf-infested territory. Wait until you see the fangs on these devil-wolves.
 The six travelers (they never seem to eat on the long journey) are a con man guide, a young man (Robert Sheen) who yearns to be a knight, the priest Debelzaq, a despondent knight who has lost his beloved wife and children, and the two lead buddies. The girl/witch has superhuman strength and possesses supernatural powers.
 The horrible plague scenes have really nasty looking victims of the pestilence. Getting more supernatural as the movie goes on, at the ending in the monastery all hell literally breaks loose.
 The movie is a strange amalgam of a number of elements and for me, though it had its share of excitement, it was ultimately unsatisfying and left an unpleasant aftertaste.",1295654400,,2341,4.787128712871287
4442750,3,B004P1IXJ0,"'Season of the Witch' is a fantasy mystery-thriller centering upon the true nature of a young girl suspected of bringing a plague down upon an entire region through her evil magic.  Or at least it tries to be when it's not posing like a medieval buddy-cop flick.

It begins in a remote village where a catholic priest has three women sentenced to death by hanging and drowning for- you guessed it- suspicion of witchcraft.  During the night when he comes back to perform a ritual to keep them from returning to life one does so, killing him and burning his holy book which contains the necessary rituals.

Cut to the Crusades where we meet Behman (Nicholas Cage) and Felson (Ron Perlman), two knights cynically hacking their way through the campaign.  After a brutal massacre of women and children they quit in disgust.  They return to Europe to find the Black Plague has swept the land, and are arrested as deserters.  The presiding cardinal is also afflicted by the disease- Christopher Lee in cameo role- and offers them a pardon if they escort a young girl suspected of witchcraft to a remote monastery where the monks can perform the rituals to banish the girl's evil (see above).  Behman agrees- on the condition that the girl can receive a fair trial.  A resident priest, Debelzaq, goes along to represent the church's interests.  The group enlists a con man, Hagamar, to be their guide and are joined by Eckhardt, a knight who lost his family to the plague and is sympathetic towards the girl, Anna (Claire Foy).  Along the way they encounter Kay, an over-pretty altar boy (is there any other kind in these movies?) whose father was a knight and seeks to prove himself.

The journey to the monastery is frought with perils physical and otherwise, resulting in the deaths of some of the group.  Anna is clearly more than she seems, playing upon the fears and sympathies of each man in turn with uncanny accuracy and insight.  There's clearly unnatural forces at work but it's not until their arrival at the monastery does evil reveal its face.  Within the holy sanctuary the survivors must make a final stand to stave off the encroaching darkness.

The big problem here is the plot.  Part buddy-movie, part wanna-be mystery and part wanna-be thriller it's a clear case of the sum not equaling all the parts.  The trailers present it as mystery- is Anna a witch or not?  Though the answer is plain- removing any semblance of suspense or mystery- there is a twist to it.

Cage & Perlman have good chemistry and their camaraderie is apparent as they trade quips before every battle.  Perlman is on record as preferring the sidekick role and he did it well, good for the few laughs that were provided.  But their dialog is odd- while Cage always plays it stiff and straight Perlman's shifts between formal and casual from scene to scene.  It just didn't flow.  Claire Foy as Anna is fun to watch as the suspected witch, and Robert Sheehan as Kay also did a credible job.  Steven Campbell Moore as Debelzaq was good as he endured a few crises of faith on the journey to the monastery.

 'Season of the Witch' is nothing to get excited about, and believe me, you won't.  As someone else described it, for a theatrical release this would've been a good midnight cable movie.  My advice to you: wait for it.",1295395200,2,3306,4.651724137931034
4442751,3,B004P1IXJ0,"The best reason for seeing Season of the Witch is partnership between Behmen (Nicholas Cage) and Felson (Ron Perlman).  Spoilers follow. Both are crusaders and the film opens with a snapshot of their various battles with a running bet they have that the one who kills the least of the ungodly enemy will buy drinks.  This good humored slaughter goes on until one day while laying siege to a town Behmen kills a woman and wants nothing further to do with fighting.  Behmen and Felson are outcasts because they have broken their vows to server the church.  As they journey home they find that a plague has decimated the country and at the first city they come to the reason for the plague is a girl (Claire Foy) who is said to be a witch.  Behmen and Felson are recognized and asked to accompany the witch to a distant monastery for trail, which they do after spending a night in a dungeon.  Christopher Lee has a small part as Cardinal D'Ambroise although he is unrecognizable (being a victim of the plague) except for his voice. The journey to see justice occupies the rest of the film as the travelers, led by a merchant who traffics in fake relics (Stephen Graham).

The production is very good with the filth and squalor of the 14th century well represented. The costumes were thoughtfully designed and the special effects are very effective and the makeup used for plague victims was very effective.  Nicolas Cage turns in a good but not overly convincing performance; Ron Perlman is easier to see in the role of a crusader.  Stephen Campbell Moore (from the Bank Job) does a convincing job playing the priest Debelzag who is determined to see the witch gets her trial. The film has some suspenseful movements, such as when the witch calls up wolves to attack her escort. However, much of the film, such as when the wagon with the imprisoned witch has to cross a crumbling wooden bridge, is predictable.  The film is worth seeing if you like B movies and are in the mood.",1295222400,3,1975,4.5852272727272725
