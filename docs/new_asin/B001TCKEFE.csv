8341001,3,B001TCKEFE,"Although the DVD series package was unopened, all the brackets which hold them in place were broken and have scratched all 4 DVDs. While watching, it freezes, skips scenes and worst of all restarts DVD from the beginning. It was mailed in an unpadded manila envelope that was sealed when it arrived so it was hard to say if it was damaged while in transit. Initially I did think that $30.00 + was expensive but now that I can't watch it, it was a complete waste of money. I gave it 3 stars because the 19 minutes that I was able to see were great.",1296259200,,547,4.219047619047619
