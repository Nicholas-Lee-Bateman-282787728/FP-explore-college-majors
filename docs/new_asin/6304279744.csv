I just finished watching the ""live studio documentary"" VHS tape and while the video and audio quality leave a bit to be desired in this all-digital age, it's still a fantastic film. It's a fascinating study of how Joe's creativity comes to life and because this album features much of it's music recorded live in the studio it's a real departure from most stuff that's recorded these days. In particular, the film concentrates on ""Luminous Flesh Giants"" and shows several takes which is really interesting and very enlightening. LFG just happens to be my favorite song on the album and seeing how it came to fruition (including recording it a year later with a different drummer!) makes it just that much better. If only this could be released on DVD or Blue-Ray!",1400198400,,893,4.730769230769231
7868294,2,6304279744,"Manu Katch, one of the best drummers you could hire, is pretty much crapped on by Joe Satriani regarding his song ""Luminous Flesh Giants.""  Manu does takes that even the producer is complimenting and Satriani, in some kind of old-man stubbornness, just cannot get past the fact Manu is not playing a boring retarded-simple 4/4 beat. He ends up firing him and the producer's SON takes over!  What's VERY funny is how Manu smiles while taking criticism as if to say, ""You do know I just got done yet another tour with Peter Gabriel, right?""

For musicians, the movie should be viewed as a comedy, and a cautionary tale to any musician who thinks they're too good to take advice or suggestions from ANYONE, regardless if it is their own project or not.  Joe Satriani should be ASHAMED of this footage. I sure as hell would be.",1208563200,,823,4.578231292517007
7868295,4,6304279744,"This Tape wasn't bad. Not many artists make a tape about how their album was made, so us satch fans should be really greatful. This tape is all about how the self titled album was made. I wish it was for one of his other albums, but we can't have everything. You get to see a lot of outtakes on the album, and get to see how the album came to life. A must for any satch fan collection!",1043193600,,385,3.8860759493670884
7868296,3,6304279744,"I justed watched it a few times.  I would like everyone to know that it is really just a documentary, and it doesnt show much shots of him playing as it does talking.  I liked it however, its nothing to make a big deal over.",990576000,2,224,3.9555555555555557
