8161957,1,B000LIA13C,I was very disappointed in the quality,1444608000,,38,4.571428571428571
8161958,5,B000LIA13C,Great for little kids.,1418083200,,22,4.75
8161959,5,B000LIA13C,"I bought this as a gift for my mother who entertains a lot. She has a big screen tv and wanted something like this to run in the background at parties. She loves it. You can have sound or just picture, mute works. This turns her big screen tv into a huge aquarium that doesn't need cleaning! The scenes are very life-like, I would highly recommend this product!",1308268800,,361,4.323529411764706
8161960,3,B000LIA13C,"Always wanted a large aquarium but with cats and kids it wasn't going to happen. The picture quality is great on HDMI big screen and we can have our own music on in the background. The BEST thing about this video, is playing it for real estate showings now that we listed our home for sale. Bad housing market, but a fun video for staging atmosphere!",1235952000,,350,4.318181818181818
8161961,5,B000LIA13C,This is the best in the 'Living' series; the bigger your screen the better. Who isn't attracted to peak at an acquarium? Kids love it. You will too.,1216771200,,148,4.321428571428571
8161962,2,B000LIA13C,Not at all impressed. The scenes look like they were shot from a camcorder a few inches from an aquarium. Better than a black screen on a large tv...but not worth paying for.,1203465600,2,174,4.303030303030303
8161963,5,B000LIA13C,Good video..I would like to have seen real ocean scenes on this..Instead it seems to be HD video of just large Aquariums,1201132800,3,120,4.5
