4705972,5,B005HVWW8U,"Fairy Tail, by far, is one of the best new animes to come out in years. Fairy Tail started in Japan almost a year and a half ago. Since then, it has become one of the most popular animes in Japan and America. The Story is gripping, the animation is of the highest quality of any anime going these days, And this one is almost perfect for the whole family (I say almost because in Japanese, there are a lot of boob related jokes. I know that is not everyone's cup of tea so fair warning). If this is a random buy, you won't be disappointed. If you are a long term fan, IT COMES WITH BLU-RAY AND DVD!!!!! I already have this one ordered. I hope this helped your decision.",1314748800,16,669,4.114503816793893

4705984,5,B005HVWW8U,"Fairy Tail Part 1 starts off with 4 introductions episodes that show the viewer the world of Fairy Tail. It explains how magic works, how guilds work, types of magic, jobs, and other things.

Despite the laid back ease of the jobs, the main characters- Lucy, Natsu, and Happy- meet in the town of Harjeon. Introductions are made to these characters. Natsu and Happy are looking for Natsu's Father- Igneel, who happens to be a real, live FIRE DRAGON. Lucy, a celestial wizard in search of a guild to join, is eventually kidnapped in the same episode. Suspicious of her kidnapper from the start, Natsu jumps into the fray, showing off his magic, and revealing that he is a wizard from one of the most renown guilds in the country- Fairy Tail. Just the guild Lucy wants to join.

Being chased by the military for mass-property damage after defeating the kidnapper, the 3 run back to Fairy Tail. Here, all of the sub characters are met. The list is too long to mention, but let me say that the writer of this show does an amazing job including sub characters. Everyone gets a part in this show. After Lucy, Natsu, and Happy complete a few trio-missions, a problem concerning the safety of the country presents itself...

Erza Scarlet- the strongest female wizard in the guild (and an expert swords master as well as a task manager), arrives at the guild hall looking for Natsu, and Gray (an ice wizard with a bad stripping habit, yet still very powerful). Erza finds them, orders and orders them to the railroad station the next day. A problem has presented itself: She has overheard a group of wizards from a dark guild planning to use a tool called ""lullaby"" to create chaos and slaughter thousands. Before leaving to stop this dark guild, the main character- Lucy, tags along on the quest. Together, this new 'Strongest Team' (hence the title of episode 8), must work together to stop this dark guild's plot to slaughter innocent civilians.

Overall, Part 1 isn't even CLOSE to being as good as the other parts. I'm personally on part 10 at the moment, and every day I am screaming as loud as I can for my favorite character to win a fight, or to stop this insanely, seemingly invincible enemy. The plots thicken, and new problems arise every part, so keep buying Fairy Tail. You'll thank yourself for doing so later!",1402358400,,2316,4.627737226277373

4706004,5,B005HVWW8U,"Unlike most other shounen series where the female characters are poorly represented (I'm-looking-at-you-Naruto), Fairy Tail is a gem when it comes to a cast of amazing kickass ladies.

Sure, the fanservice can be annoying and off-putting, but they're each so well-developed and can hold their own in battles, that they're not constantly relying on the guys to steal all the spotlight.

Erza Scarlet aside, ALL the girls are very much fleshed out with their own personalities, histories, and magic abilities.  They're not just there as sexy eye-candy, NONE of them are damsels in distresses, NONE of them need to be saved by the guys, NONE of them are weak or useless.

I LOVE THE FAIRY TAIL LADIES!!!",1377734400,,700,4.957264957264957
4706005,4,B005HVWW8U,"I was hooked from episode one.  The characters remind me quite a bit of my long time favorite series One Piece.  The art is a little ridiculous but once you're in the world, it hardly matters.  The character engage you with their quirky personalities, dorky bad jokes and epic heroic quests.  The people who love Bleach, Naruto, DBZ and of course, One Piece will find this much to their taste!",1377561600,,393,4.571428571428571

4706010,5,B005HVWW8U,"I was unsure about purchasing this at first.  An anime called ""Fairy Tail"" just didn't sound like something that would capture my attention.  However, it's a pretty neat adventure.  A lot of funny moments to go along with the story as well.",1364688000,,240,4.666666666666667

4706023,5,B005HVWW8U,I keep finding myself re-watching the anime but i hated having to read the sub titles to enjoy the show. i want to enjoy the show not the subtitles.  So i decide to buy the anime and what luck i found out they have this in English i jump all over it.  the fact it has blueray to is very nice... so when i'm ready to have blue ray i can really enjoy it in blueray mode ^.^ plus buying it just shows more support to the writer who created fairy tail ^.^ show support,1363651200,,464,3.873684210526316
4706024,3,B005HVWW8U,"Fairy Tail is the story of Natsu and the Fairy Tail Magic guild as they battle other Magic Guilds and go on various adventures. Look as much as I love originality not everything has to ""reinvent the wheel"" so to speak.  I mean hugely popular Manga/Anime like Naruto and Bleach deal with pretty standard Shonen affair as well. Why Naruto and Bleach are successful is because they are well executed. Is Fairy Tail on their level? No not even close.

There's nothing really new here, it has the sexy female characters who hate the male characters perving on them (yet they continuously dress in skimpy clothes.) The old men who are powerful but perverts.  You have the main character who like many Shonen characters is inspired by Goku i.e Natsu eats a lot of food, is goofy and clueless, yet his mind becomes razor sharp when it comes to battle and will do anything to protect his friends. And of course they have the best friend/eternal rival (Gray).

With all of that said Fairy Tail's saving grace is just how entertaining it is.  While there really isn't any surprises in character development or plot twists I found myself smiling and many times feeling genuinely touched by the characters. There is a great sense of wonder and adventure with the plots. There is also great chemistry between all of the characters, which is definitely a cut above a lot of anime that is out there.  What I also really liked was the great balance between powerful male and female characters. Unlike Naruto where the female characters seem more like talking prop pieces or stereotypes and unlike Claymore where the females are only used as soldiers because men can't use the same power. The fact that having powerful female characters isn't an issue gets a lot of praise from me.

However Fairy Tail's big flaw is just how early it peaks. There is no mind blowing plot twist or character advancement (such as when Aizen's betrayal was explained in Bleach) to put this alongside the true greats of Anime. It gets to a certain point where the story feels a little stale and you are waiting for it to turn it up a notch, but it never does.
Final thoughts? Fairy Tail is entertaining and very watchable, but far from exceptional. If you have already watched all your favourites and are looking for something to watch until the next big thing comes along, than Fairy Tail shall do nicely.",1363392000,2,2367,4.661870503597123

4706026,5,B005HVWW8U,"It came the way it should be and it's full of action, comedy. Fairy Tail is a show worth getting and watching for the whole family.",1362355200,,131,4.076923076923077
4706027,5,B005HVWW8U,"I really enjoy this series. I just started reading the manga a couple weeks back, and decided to support it by buying these combo packs. It's about the same price as I pay for the Naruto Shippuden series box sets and I get both SD & HD discs so I'm happy. The only downside I have with this is that most of the action scenes are just slightly animated versions of the panels you would read in the manga. I just wish they would fill it in some more to make the fights flow better.(If that makes sense to you) It doesn't take away from the overall quality so I still give it 5/5 stars. Many people dislike this series and I'm not sure why. It's not the greatest anime I've ever seen, but it's still a lot of fun and entertaining to watch. I would like to see more of these dubbed as the 4 Season 1 box sets(12 eps. each) only cover the manga up to chapter 125(I am only on like 140 out of 3XX at this time) While I don't mind watching subbed I still prefer to understand what they say myself. As far as dubbed voice actors of the main 5 characters, I like most of them. Erza's voice isn't bad, it's just not what I expected but after watching these first 12 episodes I've grown used to it. If you are looking into getting these I might suggest waiting a little. I believe in April they will be releasing a complete season 1 (48eps) collection box for $50 (less than half of buying all 4 individually). I decided to start getting them now because I didn't want to wait and I don't mind paying a few extra bucks to support the anime companies and/or the vendors who market it.",1361923200,,1572,4.157377049180328

4706030,5,B005HVWW8U,"I love this show. The plot line is fun, interesting and some are deep and sad. The characters are deep their backgrounds have hardships that help make them who they are and they all have a different personality which makes meeting nee characters exciting and watching them grow and interact was great.

 I love Fairy Tail, bascially it revolves around a 17 year old girl named Lucy, she wants to be part of this guild, fairy tail, she's heard from great things come from it, and wants to be part of it, too!

 Then she meets Natsu.. who is very friend bodied.. would do anything for his friends.... all around great guy, the great times roll right off at the gate, they run into a bit of a scuffle right at the get go... this is a great story line, I love all of the character's this anime is pretty special, everybody actually takes something different from animes and manga's, but this one is a defiant favorite, love it, a lot. It's actually still ongoing, it will really suck if you can't get the dvd's in na after the 4th release, but still, it's a great anime, read the manga, too , you won't be disappointed....

  This is actually my weekly ritual.. watch Fairy Tail! Never miss a day of it!! watch it , you will be pleasantly surprised!",1358640000,,1082,4.348258706467662

***This Review is Spoiler Free, and covers the First Two Seasons (Part 1 and 2)***

""Fairy Tail"", is based on a Japanese comic book (manga) series, which is based on Japanese role-playing games (JRPGs). Basically, watching Fairy Tail is like watching a JRPG. If you have not played any JRPGs, then you should know that all RPGs are more or less based on Dungeons and Dragons. In other words, Fairy Tail is in principle a fantasy world filled with magic, dragons, and all that jazz. It is NOT Tolkien, so don't expect Lord of the Rings. This series was not created primarily with adults in mind. It was created so that adults could enjoy it, but it's most definitely meant for teenagers. That said, I'm far past my teens and I very much enjoyed this series. I admit that I am a fan of animation, however I am NOT an Anime (Japanese animation) fan. Which is not to say I don't like Anime, I simply don't watch that much Anime. I want to point that out, since I believe this is a series that even people who are not Anime fanatics can still appreciate and really enjoy.

So then, what to expect? Fairy Tail has a number of main characters which I describe below. Note that I will be using the American names, since I only watched the English dub, which I will talk about later. First, the principle players:

Lucy: she is your ""typical"" adolescent guy's dream. In other words, she is blonde, blue-eyed, big boobs, and is a schoolgirl. Yeah, so clearly she ""appeals"" to more than just adolescents. Anyway, Lucy also displays other traits common in Japanese Anime and RPGs, meaning she wears form-revealing clothes, get's captured now and then, and cries now and then. She may not sound very original, and in many ways she is not, however she is actually fairly endering and also quite funny. Fortunately, as the series progresses, she also becomes stronger, more confident, and fights more. She has the ability to summon spirits to her aid, and the spirits are very funny! For example, she can summon a Minotaur that is totally infatuated with her (and is quite open about it)!

Natsu: Natsu got rejected from Dragonball, and thus found a job in Fairy Tail. Seriously, if you thought Lucy was generic, wait until you see Natsu! Spiky hair? check. Rebellious attitude? check. Heart of gold? check. Just wants to eat and fight? check. I personally find him the most boring character. That said, he does have his moments, and I find that as things progress he is more tolerable. If I were a really young kid, I would definitely admire Natsu. However, I'm not a really young kid, and I find Natsu a bit cliche. Fortunately he has quite a few funny moments, many due to Erza and Happy.

Happy: Happy is a blue cat. That talks. And can fly. Happy is awesome. He's basically a narrator of sorts (although Fairy Tail has an actual narrator as well) that often helps out the team and is hilarious and cute. He sticks with Natsu, and is far more entertaining in my opinion. This cat has spunk!

Erza: she's your typical beautiful girl-next-door who could beat you to a pulp without breaking a sweat. Although her character is very serious, often when she's around funny things happen. Many people are scared of her, because she is serious and pushes herself and others to the limit (and can beat most anyone to a pulp), and this often leads to wonderfully comedic situations. As you find out later in the series, she like everyone else, has secrets and her own daemons to overcome. Erza is a favorite for many, and for good reasons.

Gray: well, he's a lot like Natsu, but more quiet and thoughtful. Thus, less annoying at times. Still, he is stereotypical in that he gets hit a billion times and then gets up saying ""ouch, ouch, OK, I'll get you!"" [I paraphrase]. Natsu is a fire wizard, and Gray is an ice wizard, so obviously they get into fights... but fortunately Erza is there to keep these guys on the straight path.

So, the aforementioned are the main characters, but the supporting cast is actually fantastic! One of the great things about this series is that the supporting cast really do play an important role. They are not just there to go on errands for the main characters, but really move the plot forward and show character development. That is one of the great things about this series, there is substantial character development... although Natsu has not developed too much yet, but the series is still young! Anyway, Natsu and all, the characters really mesh beautifully. The stories are often very humorous, and there's enough action to keep things entertaining and fresh.

Animation Style: this animation style is very similar to the manga, with characters showing exaggerated expressions etc. I'm not a huge fan of this style, but for this particular series it fits perfectly. I don't think the animation is as beautiful as some other animated series I have seen. In my opinion it's not as stylistically beautiful as Batman the Animated Series, nor is it anywhere as majestic as the classic Disney or Studio Ghibli films. That said, the animation does the job and at times can be beautiful. Also, the animation is mostly hand-drawn, with some computer animations. I much prefer hand-drawn animation, and fortunately the computer animation is not overly used (all the spells are computer generated).

Music: The opening and closing tracks can be both addictive and annoying at the same time. That said, all the music throughout the series is good. I don't find it particularly memorable, and I have no interest in purchasing the soundtrack, but it fits the bill perfectly. What does the music sound like? Honestly, it sounds like a JRPG (not a surprise).

Story: the plots may be nothing new (good vs. evil...characters with hidden secrets...dragons, magic,...save the city/world...) but you will love how the characters interact, and how they grow and develop! There's romance, mystery, and LOTS and LOTS of hilarious mayhem! This series is basically a fantasy/comedy, and very well done. There is NO nudity nor gruesome violence (I have seen zero blood in this series). It is 100% (well, at least 90%) kid friendly. Of course a young kid will not understand everything that's happening, but I think they would still find it entertaining. Still, I feel this series was made for older kids, including the kid that all adults still have somewhere deep down!

***What's GOOD***
+++Great storytelling! Good pace! Often very very funny!
+++The interaction between all the characters is charming and hilarious!
+++World is dynamic, so characters will change, and the story will progress!
+++Characters do develop (well, most do)!
+++Excellent English cast! I haven't heard the Japanese (it's available if you want it), but I'm super pleased with the English dub.

***What's Bad***
-characters can be generic/cliche (""oh hey, you've got an evil grin and harsh laugh...gee, guess you are evil"")
-you get 4 discs! BUT this is a DVD/blu ray set, so if you want just blu ray, guess what... you're also paying for the DVDs anyway!
-very few extras. I don't consider this terrible, but if you're someone that really likes extras in a set, you will be disappointed.
-the episodes are short, so you will be seeing the opening and ending credits A LOT!

OVERALL: I really have enjoyed the Fairy Tail sets. This is the most enjoyable Anime experience I have had in years. Mostly, this is due to the hilarious nature of the series. If you're an Anime fan and/or JRPG fan, you should not hesitate to get this. If you're like me, and want to give something new a chance, I would recommend purchasing both the first and second season (Parts 1 and 2), since they form a continuous story-arc. Chances are you won't be disappointed. Also, the second season (Part 2) is much better than the first, but remember that the first season is more or less to introduce the characters. I look forward to seeing the remaining series as they are released. As I said in the beginning, this is an excellent series if you know what to expect: a light-hearted action/fantasy series with romance and lots of humor! Happy says ""Aye!""",1356998400,,8286,4.752433936022253

It just didn't appeal to me at the time. however I gave in and after watching the first episode I got hooked. The show has some very interesting characters and storylines. This show has the right amounts of hilariousness, serious moments, and fighting scenes all meshed together which makes it an awesome show to watch.",1352332800,,399,4.555555555555555
4706041,4,B005HVWW8U,"I don't remember why I bought this series, but the reasons don't matter. The enjoyment is what matters; and I did a lot of enjoying. It is the story of a wizard guild and the crazy people that make it up. The main characters are Natsu, Lucy, Gray, and Erza. Natsu is the main character and a fire wizard. Lucy is a celestial spirit wizard, Gray is a ice wizard, and Erza uses materializing sword and armor magic. The story follows their adventures all over the place and finds them in all sorts of trouble.

Fairy Tail has high quality animation, and good voice acting. I've heard better dubs, but this one isn't bad. The music is also just ok. Despite that this anime is a lot of fun. It does tend to be a little drug at times, but there are some great moments and a whole lot of fun and laughs. I have the first 4 parts of this anime and I've really enjoyed it. I think fans of any genre could get a lot of entertainment out of this anime. Buy part 1 and check it out.",1350172800,,970,4.105263157894737
4706042,5,B005HVWW8U,"Fairy tail is an awesome, action packed anime that is just about the best thing since dragonball.

The characters are well rounded and have depth, all the characters grow, not just the power players and you never forget the main theme of the story: friendship!

So if you want a long, painfully serious show with dark, bland protagonists, and an overly elaborate story that makes you think the creator wrote himself into a corner and BSed his way out, go watch bleach. Yes tite kubo, I can tell.

If you want a story that will lift your spirits, tickle your funny bone and pump you up with so much awesomeness that you point your finger to the sky and scream ""aye sir"" at the top of your lungs, then I recommend you buy this series without hesitation and become a fairy tail wizard!!!!!!!!!!!",1349395200,,792,4.524475524475524

You know that saying ""always go with your first instincts"" so true... From the first episode I was hooked! Manga/Anime fans who favor series containing: Shounen, adventure, action, drama, supernatural, fantasy, comedy, etc will enjoy this series (Personal opinion) i've Watched 3 of 4 Parts on blu-ray already and the Picture is just amazing! Ok i think its time for me to calm down and give you the back drop on the series lol... Fairy Tail really is a Fairy Tail, you just wouldn't believe such a series could actually exsist. Let me say, rarely, and i mean RARELY does a series come out where I can't find not even the slightest thing to dislike or get annoyed about in it. Fairy Tail is a top shelf Manga/Anime, and its up there with the best of them. What makes Fairy Tail so great is the people working on it, they did an amazing job! The series is just so cleverly written and illustrated, its hard not to like it. The characters are awesome, fighting is superb, comedy is Lmfao funny, drama is intense and emotinal, and plot? yeah there's a plot... were taking that mission! now get the hell out the way! you can send in reconstruction when were done... AND! there are no FILLERS!!! who the hell does that!?!??! that's just sick.... and I LOVE IT!

The action is the only reason the show is good and thats definitely disappointing. Its a shame because if this show had a good plot then maybe you could put it in the same category with the best anime shows because the action is definitely bad ass.

Some complain that the characters are shallow, and I whole-heartedly disagree. The friendship between the protagonists is palpable! The family ties between the guild are so strong and the relationships are so touching that I cried several times during the first four parts, from both happiness and sadness. Not to mention the characters themselves are SO original. Plenty of attractive males and females for both sexes with unique and never-before-seen abilities, and the animation is fantastic. It's a class-A shounen, minus all the junk-- meaning the over-extended stare/scream/drama scenes that cause many fans to loose interest. This is a fight-first, explain-later anime, which constantly kept me on the edge of my seat. With no fillers, hair-raising action scenes that had me screaming at my television set, unexpected twists, and an exceptional soundtrack (played at just the right moments, the songs got me all fired up in the heat of battle and brought me to tears during a tender moment), this series will cast a spell on you and leave you begging for more.

4706051,5,B005HVWW8U,"I'm a student, and my dad's letting me write this review on his account.

First, let me say that the show deserves 5 stars, even if this is way more than I'd pay for 13 episodes of anything. I've seen several anime in the shonen genre (action/adventure aimed at teenage boys), and this is my favorite in that genre for several reasons. Others have mentioned that it doesn't suffer from too much filler, unlike other popular shows (Naruto/Bleach). The filler episodes I have seen so far were still entertaining, (I personally found it much funnier than the humor in shows like Naruto).

Second, the series' creator, Hiro, pays homage to older manga artists who inspired him while keeping his own story fresh. If you've watched several anime, you may have noticed that many shows in the same genre bear striking similarities (similar plots, main boy characters are usually strong-willed but dense like Naruto, etc.) However, Hiro plays with the stereotypical plots and characters just enough to make his story unique, but doesn't stray too far from the formula which has worked so well for past shows and manga.

Furthermore, for parents considering letting their kid watch an anime, I'd recommend this one above others. It does have violence and some fan service, which are typical of anime in general, but both the violence and the crude humor are more tame compared to other shows I've seen in this genre. It still deserves it's PG-13 rating, but the violence is largely bloodless and goreless, and there is often a good message justifying the use of violence, rather than just violence for violence's sake.

Finally, it's the recurring themes of self-sacrificial love and putting faith in the right things that won me over completely. Hiro doesn't preach, but he's clearly a thoughtful story teller whose Christianity informs his narratives. There are lessons in this show which apply to much more than the magical kingdom of Fiore.

Hopefully, there will be a more affordable DVD release in future. The voice actors for the English dub are professional and are very rarely annoying. If you're willing to pay the cash for this release, the show will not disappoint.",1337644800,2,2167,4.9423076923076925

For those who haven't heard of it heres the quick summary plot:

Across the Fiore Kingdom, wizards join guilds and make their pay by filling magical needs-but one guild has a reputation as the roughest, rowdiest, most dangerous of all: Fairy Tail!!!

A 17-year-old celestial wizard named Lucy Heartfilia runs away from home to join Fairy Tail (which is her dream), a rambunctious wizards' guild whose members are infamous for their overly destructive antics. Along the way, she meets Natsu Dragneel, a boy who is traveling the land of Fiore together with his partner Happy, a talking cat, in search of his foster parent, a dragon named Igneel who had disappeared without a trace seven years prior. Shortly after their meeting, Lucy is abducted by a wizard posing as the famous Salamander of Fairy Tail.",1334102400,,962,4.889570552147239

4706057,5,B005HVWW8U,"This is one anime that I didn't think I'd get in to.  It starts off rather slowly at first while it introduces two of the main characters.  However, after the first short story arc, it takes off and never let's go.  The characters grow on you like no other anime that comes to mind.  The action is outstanding.  The comedy had me laughing out loud which is rare for an anime.  As the story progresses, it gets deeper and darker while still retaining all of the action and comedy.

The ""theme"" is all about bonds and friendship.  Which I believe the anime portrays very well.
In terms of the quality of the American release and dubs, it is quite well done.  You can choose the original Japanese language and English subtitles if you prefer but I think Funimation actually did a good job with the English voice over.  Each disc comes with 1 show with a commentary.  I wish there were other extra's but unfortunately that is where these discs fall short.

Either way, I think it was a good idea for Funimation to release 12 episodes per set while keeping the price the right.

4706061,5,B005HVWW8U,"As an avid Anime fan, I know that claim does overshadow a lot of other great shows out there but I will explain in detail. The reason why Fairy Tail is one of the best new shows out there is because it takes a blend of all the other great series out there and what made them popular while avoiding their mistakes. If I were to sum them all together it would be like this: The epic battles of Bleach, unique characters like One Piece, powerful emotions of Naruto, and epic story lines of Full Metal Alchemist. The series has its points where it will make you bust out laughing, wiping tears from your eyes, and cheering for a character in their fight. It doesn't get overly soppy like the One Piece scenes or ridiculous world ending explosions of Dragonball Z.

The series also avoids filler arcs that are notorious in frustrating Naruto and Bleach fans in pointless non-related storylines. Another concern is the voice casting for the English voices. As difficult as it can be, it was spot on in this series! The dialogue matching the flaps and voice depiction of emotions was perfect. Having watched the series in Japanese, Erza is by far my favorite character and casting Colleen Clinkenbeard (who voiced Galatea in Claymore) was the absolute perfect match amongst the other great voice casting matches.

Every episode is engaging and fun to watch more than once. With the series already passing 100 episodes in Japan, this makes this a great series to get into. I assure you will not regret buying it. It's going to always be in a proud top place in my collection.

5 stars is simply not enough!",1328140800,2,1598,4.6

Hey everyone,

So if you are a fan of the Manga series or just an anime lover this is a pretty good one. It boasts a colorful collection of characters all with interesting story lines. Now if you want to know about the show and what it is all about I will give a brief synopsis but I'd like to focus on the DVD product itself. The show is about a country that has many gifted wizards for hire, these wizards collect in different guilds and all have unique abilities. Fire magic, Ice magic, equip magic, and item magics are just a sample of what is in the show. The story focuses one guild named, Fairy Tail, who are known for being robust and destructive, yet are known for their pure hearts (even though they have tons of antics.) The show is refreshing and funny, I would say that there is something for everyone. I would advise a parent review this before buying for children because there are busty females. Over-all I would say that it is alright for kids and adults. I am 26 and love the show if that says anything.

The DVD's all have 12 episodes. There are 4 disks, the first two are the Standard DVDs and the second two are the Blue-Ray edition. So it is pretty sweet. It has a reversible cover too as well as a cute sleeve for the dvd case. I was surprised it did not have as many extras but it makes up for it with quality. The show goes ver-batem with the Mangas so it is nice that the story line does not change at all. Good paced and the DVD leaves every part in suspenseful areas of the plot. If I could have one complaint it would be that the voice actors for some of the characters are annoying, I mean really annoying. They kinda sounded better in Japanese but this may be because I watched all the available episodes with subs before buying this...

My advice is to wait for a few to be released, one the price dropps on the DVD's so you get a way better deal than pre-order and also you can buy multiple too. Second, like every series preview it on Hulu or something before you buy.

Honestly I say that this is a great buy and makes a amazing addition to any anime collectors shelf. All the combo packs are worth it and the quality of the show and the packing is pretty good too. Hope that helped a little, happy hunting!!",1327708800,2,2434,4.5353075170842825
4706065,2,B005HVWW8U,"This series about a guild of magicians, set in a magical, whimsical world of evil-doers and magic powers is watchable, but nothing to really write home about. What does it do well? It is your classic ""shonen"" type anime series with some cute girls, boisterous male leads, and battle featuring some pretty cool powers. You have the classic elemental powers in the mix with Natsu (fire) Grey (Ice) and Lucy to add the expected cuteness and fan-service. However well intentions were with this series it falls way short of being great. The sound track is generic (in comparison to a show like Darker than Black who got the legendary Yoko Kanno (cowboy bebop) to do theirs) and predictable fight scenes. Ill say this... imagine ""Bleach"" but with castles, armor and Magicians instead of Hollows, the Soul Society and soul reapers. This pretty much sums it up. Tite Kubo did this concept YEARS before Mashima did in Fairy Tail (and it wasn't all that original when Kubo did it either). It sadly cannot compare to to other recent hits like Death Note, Darker than Black, Baccano! or even the similar-plotted Bleach. Bleach basically does what Fairy Tail does but better. To sum up...good, watchable, but definitely nothing new, exciting or notable here. Plot is linear and predictable, the fights are well written and fun to watch but not spectacular and the art is *meh*. Mediocre overall. On a side note I met Hiro Mashima at NYCC 2011 and he was a really kind personable man.",1327363200,7,1470,4.791338582677166

Regarding this specific DVD/Blu-ray set, it's just really well done.  The visuals are sharp and vivid, and while some might say it's too simplistic I think it's very stylized and well done.  The audio is pretty amazing as well.  Seriously, when it comes to the action scenes crank the volume up!  If you have a good sound system it can be as intense as a good live action movie.

The English audio dub is also very well done.  The voice cast does a great job of fitting each character.  Funimation really knows their stuff.  If you usually watch anime subtitled because you can't stand bad dubs, give this one a try; it doesn't disappoint.  The Japanese audio track is great as well, of course.

Since lots of other people have told at length what makes the series great (awesome characters, engaging, moving plot, some great humor), I'm going to keep mine on the dubbing. The Japanese language casting for this series is spot on, so it was hard for me to get used to the English dub at first, but I have to admit it has grown on me. While I wouldn't choose to watch it in English if I had the Japanese available, it certainly won't kill you. Some of the voices lack a bit in enthusiasm, but they did a good job overall of matching the original. The only things that gets me is the way they say Erza's name in the English version. Err-za. Wrong, *twitch twitch*.

That aside, it is definitely watchable, and if you really have an issue with the dub, they handily included the original Japanese too. If you are a fan, get this now.

The pure emotion in this series is what puts it at the top of my favorites list, the character development will astonish you, there's so many things and so many people for anyone to fall in love with here!  You'll laugh yourself silly right from the start, cheer on Lucy, Natsu, Erza, and so many more as they battle not only some of the most fearsome challenges to confront ""Earth Land"" and it's inhabitants, but themselves as well.

If you're worried about ""filler"" episodes, there's hardly any in this series, and those that do exist really just delve into some of the key characters' personas to give you a little more background of who's who and what's what.

I've waited long, and now is the time, way to go Funimation!  And thank you Hiro!  Buy this now, before you get all the spoilers from your friends!",1320537600,4,1201,4.472477064220183
4706081,5,B005HVWW8U,"We finally get a US release. /facepalm @ US publishers for taking so long, but moving on with the review...

Fairy Tail has been a hit series for a reason. That is, well, its just great content. Good action, nice stories, and fantastic characters. But of course, so is Naruto and Bleach/etc. However, unlike those, Fairy Tail is not riddled full of filler. For those that have been keeping up with other popular shows like Naruto, you'll know the inevitable dread that filler brings. Either poorly written or completely disjointed stories that serve no purpose but to buy time till the artists finalize the next story arc.

Now, one cannot say this series is without filler. But here is the big difference, the Fairy Tail filler is actually capable of being part of the main plot. Then also you'll see them refer to the episodes later. If you notice filler in shows like Naruto, they never are part of the main plot or are linked later. This has caused a sour taste to grow in the mouths of viewers whenever they come to the end of an arc, knowing they have to put up with months of filler next. With Fairy Tail, after watching over 100 episodes now, I honestly can say I was disappointed in maybe a half dozen of them. But they still added something to the story.

The rest of the time when watching this show, you are pleasantly moving from one arc to the next, which doesn't take long. There is a lot of comedy and slapstick antics in some episodes, while others brings in a tone of seriousness and drama that may even bring a tear to some eyes. Fairy Tail does this and it does not seem out of character when it does. Neither is it a roller coaster ride of dizzying highs and lows.

It is true that some of the story arcs are better than others. But this is affected by the characters who take a more prominent role from arc to arc. There is some variation that takes place as episodes go on. Characters will grow, some more than others. The world is big after all. There is a lot of growth that can be done in this series. Only time will tell if the writers of it can keep the good trend going strong.

Really hope this show will get a respectable English dub for you who can't read the subs. I cringe at the thought of Natsu or Lucy having voices similar to those used in big shows like Naruto. Lets just face it, English voice actors just cannot do over the top characters very well.

That said, enjoy it! Fairy Tail is a fantastic show that hopefully will be around for many years to come. It has been strange to not see it hitting the US sooner but it is good to see the show finally getting some spotlight, instead of some of the real tripe that has been picked up by publishers in the last two years. Really is good to see some quality anime getting finally released here.",1318809600,72,2783,4.32183908045977
4706082,5,B005HVWW8U,"Fairy tail is a good anime adaption. It stays true to the manga for the most part, with only a few changes here and there. It also transfers the comedy aspect pretty well, and the art style is awesome. Animation isn't the best, but it is standard, and not something that should turn you away from the anime by any means. Charging the price of a regular season, while including both the blu ray and dvds is greatly appreciated, and I thank funimation for doing this. (5 years ago a boxset with 13 eps on dvd only cost around $50)

The cast is funny and entertaining, the art style is colorful, and the magic is plentiful.
My only problem with the show is the censorship. Blood doesn't make a series, but it is vital for some of the best fairy tail moments, and there is none to be found. All wounds in this show are converted to dirt marks and bruises. The show's still entertaining, it just takes away from the intensity is all.

Regardless.. it is not a deal breaker.
The show is still enjoyable even without more intense violence. The comedy is probably the best aspect of this anime adaption.
Definitely pick this up, and show funimation we appreciate their new found dedication to charging less for more.",1315008000,6,1208,4.486363636363636

8473721,5,B005HVWW8U,wow this is a great anime.  I watched this on a streaming service and then when it became available I got some of the dvds.  The story is set on another world....from the episodes I would say that maybe this is way in the future from our time as they have the typical super advanced technology from a lost era.  But mostly this is a an Anime about magic....Fairy Tail is a guild and one of the best and most talked about guilds.  The guild is different because they believe magic should be used at all times if you have powers use them...don't be afraid and help those who also have powers.  And above all have fun doing it.  Their guild is always in trouble like for example accidentally blowing up half a town while defeating some magic creature.  What makes this one interesting is that the anime focuses on differing characters....it has a core set of them....but it also lets the core interact and lets the viewer see other types of magic.  It also gives you a very interesting back ground on a lot of characters and ends up spinning a few things together interconnecting them.  I won't post any big time spoilers...but i will say this series is still running.,1447200000,,1165,4.4575471698113205
8473722,4,B005HVWW8U,"Fairy Tail is my favorite anime ever.  Period.  With that said, in season 7, I became disgusted with not only the downgrade in animation, but the change toward blatant ""fan service"" which is denigrating to women as they dress the women in almost nothing which is barely short of soft core porn, with the OVA's being some of the worst for little plot and lots of fan service.  Before I had female friends that loved Fairy Tail.  Now I would be ashamed to even show it to a female.  For some reason the storyline also seemed to take a turn for the worse, becoming more predictable.  I am hoping they will turn it around and return it to its former greatness.",1441843200,,656,4.380165289256198
8473723,2,B005HVWW8U,"My 3/10 mangaupdates review for the whole series as of the writing. The anime is identical with a high among of filler.: I tried the series once when it was new, judged it as an attempt to rip off One Piece and moved on but i picked up our volumes on a slow day at my library job because i heard some crazy things on the web and flipped through the series again. What i saw was unoriginality to the max, tasteless ecchi (with a scene of sexualized torture standing out), no real stakes or world logic and borderline plagiarism. Is Kodansha trying to troll Shueisha here as i saw Franky and the Blue-Eyes White Dragon. So the only difference to One Piece is that the Fairy Tail constantly throws it's female leads under the bus, lacks any tone and now managed to rack up about 10 (!?!) spin-offs. Two points off and zero interest on my side remains. Read the recent Blind Faith Descent (9/10) for a good and rather dark adventure series with a comparable setting or SJ's stuff. They at least have a proven formula.",1433721600,,1013,4.3936170212765955
