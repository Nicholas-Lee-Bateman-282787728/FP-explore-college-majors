8029245,3,B0002MFG7I,"The Scenery in this DVD is Really Fantastic! The music is modern instumental with sound effects - you will either like it or not - but you have the options of playing just the Visual without sound...OR...play with some nice Instrumental of your Choice.....I've tried both and like either experience very much!

The HD is perfect with this DVD.....and some of the Scenery had me enthralled....I really enjoy the experience.....sure to buy more of their Videography_ as I like to buy a Nb of quality content DVDs with Nature and Scenery.",1316390400,,535,4.8791208791208796
8029246,2,B0002MFG7I,"I've been gracious and given this dvd 2 stars due to its affordability. There's much to complain about here. The scenes have no more to do with ""daybreak"" than any other time of day, but that's not the problem. We see shoreline filmed from planes, helicopters & boats. We move to inland areas from barren desert-like terrain to arid grazing spots with cattle strolling through our view. Still okay, right? We move again to a beach or rocky shoreline. All the while, music of a ""relaxing"" sort plays along.

The back cover surmised says ""Recorded in High Definition. Carefully selected music accompanies beautiful backdrops of sunrises, snow-capped peaks, blooming fields, and rustling leaves...a beautiful collection of natural wonders set to inspiring music. Specially designed and chosen images are matched up to carefully themed music creating the perfect harmony between sight and sound..."" Sounds good. But therein lies my complaint. I doubt that anyone spent any time designing and matching anything here. The scenes, while mostly nice, are frequently too brief and chopped together with little cohesion or theme. It seems as though someone took a bunch of travel film outtakes and spliced them together. The music, none too professional, shows no relationship to the scenes- either their pacing or subject matter. And you can't simply turn down the sound track and use your own favorite smooth-jazz or peaceful music soundtrack. The frequent too-rapid scene changes and subject matter range are simply not that well done. Is it worth the small price? I'd guess no, not if its never played a second time. I'd like to believe that one day soon someone is going to realize the large potential market for this type of product done respectfully and produce excellent quality pairings of scenic photography and music. There are a few good ones to consider ('Earthscapes', or Tangerine Dream's 'Oasis' if you don't mind time-lapse), but they are too few.",1098576000,14,1954,5.12539184952978
