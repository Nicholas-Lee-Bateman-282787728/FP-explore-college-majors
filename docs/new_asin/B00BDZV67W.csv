5582055,5,B00BDZV67W,"All of Lisa Hartman Black's TV movies are good, and this one is no exception.

The movie tells the life story of a woman who is raised by a prostitute (Betty Buckley) after the death of her elderly aunt. She marries a coal miner, who dies tragically. She then makes it her mission in life to avenge his death- even at the expense of her own happiness.

The men pictured on the cover only have supporting roles. Lisa is the only central character in this story.

The movie is uncut and is excellent quality.

I hope they release more of Lisa's TV movies on dvd- other great ones she did are ""Bodily Harm"", ""Falsely Accused"", ""Out of Nowhere"", ""Someone Else's Child"", ""Red Wind"", and ""Have You Seen My Son?"" ...All 6 of these movies need to be released on dvd!",1365638400,9,758,4.392857142857143

5582065,4,B00BDZV67W,"This harkens back to the wonderful 1980's which featured many mini series as great TV entertainment.  It is the story of a poor backwater girl who through her early hard knocks in life decides to make something out of herself.  Along the way, she is obsessed with getting even with one particular man whom she holds responsible for a tragedy.  Good, absorbing story.",1414368000,4,366,4.777777777777778

5582072,5,B00BDZV67W,"This is one of my favorite miniseries.  Lisa Hartman-Black as well as the other characters does a great job in the story telling of this movie.  Lisa was a little girl who wanted it all and went after it while be obsessed with revenge for the death of her 1st husband who was killed in a mining accident.  In her journey, after almost going to jail for a murder she did not commit, she found out that having it all wasn't what it was cracked up to be.

5582073,5,B00BDZV67W,"Great story about a woman who rises from very little to becoming a mogul. Lisa Hartman is excellent in this role; the chemistry between her and Penny is awesome. Her ongoing quest for revenge is something the viewer can really feel; I enjoyed watching her machinations, vulnerability, and emotional ties. Great acting by Dern and Penny and superb acting by Lisa Hartman. A winner for me. Something I will watch again, it is that good.",1379980800,4,434,4.8

How can you get away with selling something as new and complete?  WB, you do this all the time.  You are releasing lovely movies that I adored and want so badly. However, I will not buy them from you as they are NOT complete.  Please, please, please become a stand up company that sells what you advertise rather than just trying to increase all of your profits.  Be who you would want your children to emulate.",1369353600,2,548,4.366336633663367
