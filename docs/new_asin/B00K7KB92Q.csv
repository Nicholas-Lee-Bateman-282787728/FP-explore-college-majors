8656563,5,B00K7KB92Q,Every single match on this dvd is great from the opening match (with the debut of three new wrestlers to the roster to the last match with (PWG Championship Ope Invitational  Match Candice LeRae Vs. Adam Cole) My only complain  was the last match was against a woman wrestling but she put up a hell of a fight. I don't like male wrestlers fighting/wrestling female wrestlers. But still an awesome dvd throughout,1404086400,,411,4.694444444444445
8656564,4,B00K7KB92Q,"Now for those who don't already know, Pro Wrestling Guerrera (P.W.G.) is a promotion based out of southern California who holds events monthly/bi-monthly that feature local independent wrestlers along with some names who work for other promotions as well like Ring Of Honor, DragonGate, Evolve, and Championship Wrestling From Hollywood. The theme of this event was that it was the second time in history that the card or talents were never advertised leading up to the event so all the matches would be a complete mystery to the crowd throughout the night.

P.W.G. Champion Adam Cole defended his championship against his most unusual challenger possibly in his entire career because he was a facing a woman he's had issues with for months in Candice LaRae who didn't back down & brought the fight to Cole with some lucha libre offense & even stealing a page out of Cole's playbook at one point causing Cole to be more focused on hurting & humiliating her than just winning the match.  P.W.G. Tag Team Champions Young Bucks (who at this time were also the I.W.G.P. Jr. Tag Team Champions & ROH Tag Team Champions leading to a once in a lifetime ""Instagram"" photo opp to the live audience) defended their championships against Best Friends (Chuck Taylor & Trent?) with Matt Jackson still having a cast on his hand from his injury that was a heavy target in a fast paced match that saw a series of double teaming & counters from both teams along with the influence of the ""secret weapon"" coming into play as well.  Unbreakable F'n Machines (Michael Elgin & Brian Cage) vs. Inner City Machine Guns (Ricochet & Rich Swann) vs. American American Wolves (ACH & A.R. Fox) all collided in a 3 way tag in a ""power vs. speed vs. agility"" match with each team showcasing their strength as a team throughout the match through either their high risk & impact offense or through some comedic moments from doing arm curls while holding a body to one man ""getting served"" by his opponent along with both teams also pulling some moves that weren't typical of their regular offense in a highly competitive lengthy encounter.  Other matches include Johnny Gargano vs. Kyle O'Reilly in a heavy submission based encounter, Tomasso Chiampa vs. Chris Hero in a stiff encounter that saw both men work a more dirty style as the match went on while the crowd couldn't help but notice that one man in this match ""ain't nuthin' ta f' wit'"", Anthony Nese vs. Roderick Strong, Willie Mack & B-Boy & Joey Ryan vs. RockNES Monsters & Peter Avalon, and the opening match between Cedric Alexander vs. Andrew Everett vs. Trevor Lee that started out with the crowd chanting ""who are you"" at one of the participants only for them to deliver non-stop action in & out of the ring with both a grounded & high flying style that kept their crowd on the feet to the point where they not only chanting that participants name was but asking for all three men to ""please come back!""

You can never go wrong with a P.W.G. event & this was no exception as it wasn't their best or one of their top memorable shows but it was still a quality event that I would recommend.",1403568000,,3122,4.638336347197106
