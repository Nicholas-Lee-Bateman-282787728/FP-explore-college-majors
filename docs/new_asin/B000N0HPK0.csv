8173763,3,B000N0HPK0,"It is a bonafide tragedy what the folks responsible for this DVD have done to the Gunny!!  Not even a proper DVD menu!  That is to say nothing of the fact there has been very little in the way of extras on these Mail Call DVDs to begin with.  And as always, I am wondering aloud why on earth they don't include ALL episodes of the season?

The stars of this rating are purely for the Gunny, who travels to some awesome destinations including hallowed ground that is Iwo Jima.  The Gunny sure deserves better treatment than he got here.  Cue the Taps...

Hoo-rah!!",1188345600,,563,4.355769230769231
