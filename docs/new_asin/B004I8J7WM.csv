8430263,5,B004I8J7WM,"I give this movie 2 thumbs up. The women ensemble in this movie were convincing in their individual portrayals of convicted felons all searching for forgiveness and a chance to start anew. The formation of the choir along with politics of convincing prison officials to give them a chance to at least try and the perserverance of all these women was indeed admirable. I  wanted a little more of the ending, but a sentenced served is just!",1369440000,,438,4.688311688311688
