7767695,5,B01GU35K8W,"Disregard any negative reviews about this years Summerslam, because it was one for the ages.  watched it on the WWE network later in the week by the way if you don't have the network get it all 19 PPV'S $9.99 A month plus everything else, amazeballs.  now lets get back to summerslam, what can I say ECW lives again at summerslam thats all I can say ECFN'W.  from the first bell to the last pinfall or TKO you know right out of the gates its going to be a wild ride and it only gets more wild and extreme from there.  No special stipulations No weapons just plain straight good REAL ACTUALL WRESTLING/or FIGHTS.  fueled with emotion everyone leaves it on the line and risks there body and lives for all of us to put on one of the if not the best summerslam of all time.  It truly showcases the future of the WWE.  Some people say its a second wrestlemania from this year, I say bring it on, bring me more.  The future is here the future is now.",1472083200,3,944,4.176795580110498
7767696,3,B01GU35K8W,"1.) Enzo and Cass vs Jeri-KO

The official show starts off with some fast paced but average tag team action between the hometown heroes, Enzo and Cass against the recently formed duo of Jeri-KO. Enzo and Cass attempt their double team move but it's derailed by Owens who trips Cass and sends him into the ring post and then the barricade. This leaves Enzo at the mercy of a 2 on 1 attack from Jericho and Owens who drop Enzo with a really sick looking Pop-Up/Codebreaker combo for the win. Standard match to get the night underway

2.) WWE Women's Championship Match: Charlotte vs Sasha Banks (c)

This was the much anticipated rematch for the Women's Championship after Sasha defeated Charlotte on the 7/25 episode of Raw. The match was pretty good and proved that Charlotte is one of the best female workers in the WWE today (since a lot of people seem to think otherwise). However, a problem with this match is that there were way too many dangerous high spots with Charlotte being rough with Sasha that looked incredibly uncomfortable. The biggest one I can recall is Charlotte performing a sidewalk slam off the turnbuckle and allowing Sasha's body to free fall to the mat, causing her to land badly on her neck and back. She looked out of it for most of the match after that. In the end, Charlotte counters a Bank Statement into a cradle pin to win her 2nd Women's Championship. Not a bad match but they should reduce their high spots going forward to reduce someone seriously getting hurt. But this was probably Charlotte's best PPV performance since Wrestlemania

3.) WWE Intercontinental Championship Match: Apollo Crews vs The Miz (c)

There was really only like a week's worth of build up for this match that happened on the final Smackdown before SummerSlam. Usually when a champion is put in a filler feud that has little to no build-up, it's a great indication that they're going to retain their championship. This match really didn't surpass being average. It felt more like a match that should've happened on Smackdown rather than a PPV. The Miz retains with a Skull Crushing Finale. Apollo Crews is an incredible athlete, but he needs more depth. All we know about him is his name and that he loves to smile....a lot. If this feud with Miz carries over another month, they need to give Crews a standout gimmick for the better

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

4.) AJ Styles vs John Cena

Match of the night right here! If you're looking for fast paced, hard hitting, back and forth action, this is the match you need to check out. Styles and Cena literally give each other everything they have, even pulling out a few moves no one has yet to see. I'm sure I'm not alone when I say I thought the top rope AA was going to be the match ender as rarely anyone has ever kicked out of that. When Styles did, my heart stopped for a second. In the end, Styles counters another AA attempt from Cena into a Styles Clash and a Phenomenal Forearm for the win. Styles wins clean over Cena in what was undoubtedly a 5 star technical classic. Cena continues to put over talent at SummerSlam and I've got to say I was proud to see him cleanly do the job to AJ. This match definitely has potential to be Match of the Year

5.) WWE Tag Team Championship Match: The Club (Doc Gallows and Karl Anderson) vs New Day (Kofi Kingston and Xavier Woods) (c) w/Jon Stewart

I may be in the minority but I'm a fan of Gallows and Anderson and enjoyed their mini doctor personas they played in the weeks leading to SummerSlam after giving Big E a severe case of ""ring post-itis and was looking forward to this match. Unfortunately the crowd was kind of dead for the match and the match didn't have a whole lot to get excited about. Jon Stewart awkwardly tries to interject himself into the match and prepares to get his grapefruits slammed into the ring post, but Big E returns and attacks The Club, causing the match to end on a DQ. Wasn't really invested in this match and not too much of the crowd was either

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

6.) WWE Championship Match: Dolph Ziggler vs Dean Ambrose (c)

This was another example of a feud where the hype was really really captivating but the match itself just didn't measure up. Ambrose and Ziggler have pretty much a basic, brawling/grapple wrestling match. There really wasn't much of an in-ring connection going on between the two. Ambrose plants Ziggler with the Dirty Deeds to retain the championship. Unlike most, I won't blame the lackluster of this match on Ambrose, because he's had some memorable matches this year. Instead I'll just say that Ambrose and Ziggler don't have any in-ring chemistry with each other. Promo/talking/segment wise, yes. Wrestling wise, no.

7.) Carmella, Naomi, and Becky Lynch vs Natalya, Alexa Bliss, and Nikki Bella

Originally, Eva Marie was supposed to be a part of this match but due to her suspension, it was Nikki Bella taking her place, competing in her first match since last October. Surprisingly enough, Nikki got one of the biggest pops of the night from the Brooklyn crowd. Not a whole lot going for this match but it got some nice ring time which gave all 6 women a chance to show what they have. Carmella gets worked over for most of the match by the heel team before making the hot tag to Becky. Becky and Naomi get some time before Carmella gets tagged back in. Nikki knocks her out with a forearm and finishes her off with her new finishing move, the TKO for the win. Again, there wasn't a whole lot going for this match and seemed for like a match meant for the pre-show or Smackdown but at the same time, I commend them for trying to take Smackdown's Women's division seriously and give them air time on the actual card. Hopefully by the time Backlash rolls around, the ladies are competing for a championship and not ""just because""

8.) WWE Universal Championship Match: Seth Rollins vs Finn Balor

Finn Balor/Demon King Balor/Demon Balor/Demon Finn, etc, etc made his main roster PPV debut here, competing against Rollins in the first ever Universal Championship match. The Universal Championship was cherry red and could easily be mistaken at first sight for being the Women's Championship. The crowd was none too impressed with the championship and made their feelings vocal about it before, during, and after the match. The match itself between Balor and Rollins was good but it was nothing that was overly spectacular. Once again, it was a match that should've been highly regarded but the crowd was once again pretty mild for it. Balor hits a Coup de Grace on Rollins to an average reaction from the crowd to become the first ever Universal Champion. I thought the match was pretty good but I'm hoping to see even better in their rematch

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

9.) WWE United States Championship Match: Roman Reigns vs Rusev (c)

This match never really begins as Reigns and Rusev being brawling at ringside that has to be stopped by several referees. Reigns gets the upperhand, giving Rusev a beating similar to the one he gave Triple H at TLC last year and gets a fairly positive reaction from the Brooklyn crowd. Kind of a shame that this match didn't happen. If that's the way it was going to be, then it should've come before both World Championship matches

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

10.) Brock Lesnar vs Randy Orton

This match was built as being ""15 years in the making"", playing up Orton and Lesnar being members of the OVW Class of 2002 and having never fought each other before (not counting their one time encounter on a 2002 episode of Smackdown). Many were expecting something big to happen (like a Goldberg return) since this match went on last, but nothing big really happened. What did happen was seeing the same tiring formula every Brock Lesnar match has consisted of since the 2014 SummerSlam: endless German suplexes. We got a short toss into the crowd and an RKO through the table and Orton's second rope DDT; but other than that, Lesnar was in control the entire match with his suplexes. Lesnar drops Orton with an F5 and begins pounding him in the face and head, causing Orton to bleed a great deal. No one really knows if it was a bad blade job or a legitimate cut from the hits but the crowd went silent after getting sight of the blood quickly pouring from Orton's head to the mat. Orton is unable to continue and Brock is awarded the match via TKO. Shane McMahon tries to check on Orton after the match but gets F5'd for his efforts to close SummerSlam. The match had promise but WWE let that go to waste. It was an unsatisfying end to the PPV that left a bad taste in the mouth of a lot of fans

Overall: I'm not really sure how to feel about this year's SummerSlam. The show overall reminded me a lot of how Wrestlemania 32 was. The build-up was great and looked to make for a promising show but by the time the PPV rolled around, the card didn't live up to the hype. I'm not sure if it was the PPV being 4 hours or the format of the show or the way certain matches played out, but the hype didn't stick around long for SummerSlam. AJ Styles vs John Cena unquestionably stole the show and had the best match of the night. Overall, the 2016 SummerSlam was a bit of a letdown in some aspects. Again, similar to Wrestlemania, it wasn't bad or good but somewhere right in between",1471824000,2,10241,5.133933933933934

7767705,4,B01GU35K8W,"The Enzo Amore & Big Cass vs. Chris Jericho & Kevin Owens tag match was a competitive tag team match between two teams that know how to get a great reaction from the crowd. It followed the same formula of every E&C match with Enzo getting worked over for it, hot tag to Cass and then it led to a loss, which is a bit of a surprise. I thought E&C were going to win since they're the younger team and the more permanent team, but I certainly don't mind my fellow Canadians Owens and Jericho getting the win. Im interested in seeing whats next for all of them. The WWE Womens Championship match: Sasha Banks vs. Charlotte was another really good match from these two women. The result surprised me even though I was aware of the betting odds with the big shift towards Charlotte. Its just a surprise from a story-line perspective because I expected Banks to hold the title for more than a month. Im not sure why they would take the gold off her so soon unless its because they want them to have more matches and keep the rivalry going for the rest of the year. As for the match, I liked the psychology of working on the back of Banks through much of it. Then Banks tried to work on Charlottes back. Banks came close to winning by submission a few times, but Charlotte kept finding a way to escape. Some big spots in the match like Banks hurricanrana reverse off the top rope, which was very impressive. Charlotte winning with a counter is fine for a heel. The Intercontinental Championship match: The Miz vs. Apollo Crews was a short match to put over Miz as the champion. Crews is not getting over with the crowd and part of that is because of the booking. The booking prior to the match was poor. There wasn't much of a crowd reaction for anything that Crews did. I thought that maybe Miz would retain by DQ and keep the feud going, but it was a fairly clean win for him. Hopefully the next IC Title contender is built up better than Crews was. The AJ Styles-John Cena match was a great match. Wow. That was very impressive. They only had one televised match two months ago, but they have wrestled at live events too. Clearly they have built up an amazing chemistry together. So many believable near-falls for both guys. I thought Cena had it won a couple of times and then I thought Styles could have won multiple times as well. What a great build up to a big moment at the end. I liked how Cena reacted in a big way when he didn't win after the middle ropes AA. He was shocked it didn't win, which cost him because it allowed Styles to come back. Im glad that Styles won because it makes sense to give him some momentum heading into a possible feud with Dean Ambrose. Cenas off to film the American Grit TV show soon. He deserves credit for putting over Styles over again and this one was better than their Money in the Bank match. One of the best matches this year. I think its my only match with that rating with Nakamura/Zayn at five stars, which is the leader for M.O.T.Y at this point. This is second place for me at this point. If I watch it again I may change my mind. The WWE Tag Team Championship match: Kofi Kingston & Xavier Woods vs. Luke Gallows & Karl Anderson was an okay match designed to set up the return of Big E even though he was the reason the team actually lost the match. They are still champions, though. I expected a title change, but that didn't happen. Using that match to bring back Big E made sense. I still think G&A win the tag titles from them. Its just not happening yet. The WWE World Heavyweight Championship match: Dean Ambrose vs. Dolph Ziggler was a decent match, but a little disappointing because I expected something better. The crowd never seemed to get into as much as they should have. Thats what Ill remember about this match more than anything, which sucks for the talent because these guys busted their ass. It just didn't click for some reason.  Its an example of why you shouldnt book shows where the crowd is supposed to be there for six hours counting from the time they get into the building until the end of the show. They didn't build up Zigglers near-falls enough. He nailed some big moves, but it just didn't have the near-falls that a match like Cena/Styles did. Ambrose winning is no surprise. Hes done a good job as champion. AJ Styles should be his next challenger. The Becky Lynch, Naomi & Carmella vs. Natalya, Alexa Bliss & Nikki Bella 6 Diva tag match was a solid match that the crowd wasn't into that much except when Nikki was in there. Its encouraging that they got 11 minutes, but there were a few minutes that were boring. Nikki looked pretty good for somebody that has missed about six months with a serious neck injury. I doubt shes going to be teaming with the heels very often because the crowd likes her and wants to cheer her, so shell probably be a face. The WWE Universal Championship match: Seth Rollins vs. Finn Balor was a very good match from two of the best WWE performers in their first match together. Theyll probably have a lot of matches over the years.  Im not surprised by the outcome because its a way to put over Balor huge as well as the new title. It would have been nice if Rollins worked as more of a heel because he really isn't cheating in matches or acting like a heel very often. Balor showed good baby-face heart the whole time. Balor did a lot of dropkicks like he usually does and finished it off clean. Impressive win for Balor, who wins his P.P.V debut. If Rollins won it would have been fine because hes such a good performer, but this win elevated Balor immediately. As I said, Cole immediately calling it a World Title is weird when they tried to differentiate it with the Universal Title name. The Rusev vs. Roman Reigns-US Title match was an angle, not a match. They had the long match on Raw because they planned on not doing a match here. It keeps the feud going. Reigns is getting cheered against Rusev because of the cheap heat tactics that Rusev uses to get the crowd against him. Its simple, but it works. For people complaining about match order, it made sense now to do the long Balor/Rollins match, then do this angle and go into the main event from there. The Randy Orton vs. Brock Lensar match was a unique finish that I wasn't really expecting, but it put over Lesnar as a violent man that absolutely decimated a WWE legend in Orton. I liked the story of the match with Lesnar dominating the first ten minutes, Orton hit that RKO and I thought they would build to a competitive match from there. Instead, it just ended soon after with Lesnar cutting him open with those elbows. I get that it puts over Brock and theres nothing wrong with that, but I think it would have been better with an ending that was booked better. I give this PPV a 7 out of 10.",1475193600,,6773,4.34913112164297
7767706,5,B01GU35K8W,Best summerslam yet!!! Including not having Seth win the new WWE title,1473379200,,70,4.916666666666667
7767707,4,B01GU35K8W,"Enzo & Big Cass vs. Chris Jericho & Kevin Owens - Jericho & Owens attacked from behind before the bell only for Enzo & Cass rebounding with Cass using Enzo as a weapon himself as the match went back & forth with one team singling out one of their opponents continuing to mock him while the action as both teams hit some big double team & unique offense in a fun opening contest.

Womens Champion Sasha Banks vs. Charlotte - Both women started this match out with a bang as Sasha attempted a Bank Statement in the opening minute only for Charlotte to dangerously drop her from the top rope & heavily focus on an area of the body to the point where Sasha was visibly in pain but still kept fighting including a unique reversal to an attempted top rope maneuver as both women turned up the intensity trading slaps & fist taking bigger risk either off the top rope along with counters to each other's signature offense delivering maneuvers & variations not previously seen from each other in what was a highly competitive encounter from both women.

Intercontinental Champion The Miz vs. Apollo Crews - Miz started attacking right at the bell being able to keep staying ahead of Crews shrugging off his offense & keeping him grounded before Crews was able to utilize his power & athletic ability such as catching Miz into executing his own offense on more than one occasion as it ultimately came down to one man being able to use his opponents momentum against him.

John Cena vs. A.J. Styles - Both men were evenly matched as Styles was able to score with a simple offensive maneuver only for Cena to response with a punch to the mouth as both men continued to trade big maneuvers against each other from inside the ring & apron to having counters for each other's signature moves while executing their own including some unique combinations that are rarely seen from each other as they continued to go back & forth executing submissions & aerial offense from the top rope & springboard positions in what was a highly competitive contest from bell to bell with neither man having a distinct advantage for a long period of time.

Tag Team Champions New Day vs. The Club - It should be noted that with Big E injured by the club weeks earlier, special guest John Steward was made an honorary member of New Day for the match.  New Day started off in control with Kofi showcasing his athleticism including executing an aerial move posing in mid-air while Woods utilized strategy to neutralize his opponent's power & strength advantage only for The Club to resort to various dirty tactics & double teaming in a solid contest that was more of a backdrop to the aftermath.

WWE Champion Dean Ambrose vs. Dolph Ziggler - SmackDown Commissioner Shane McMahon & General Manager Daniel Bryan were at ringside & got physically involved separating both men from each other during the introductions while you should pay attention as J.B.L. on commentary had a remark towards a certain MMA fighter.  Both men traded slaps in the opening moments only for the fight to get taken to the outside with one man utilizing the environment to his advantage while his opponent utilized a variety of suplexes from different positions of the ring as they went back & forth using strategies such as using their opponent's momentum against them & catching them in mid-air to offense coming off the top rope in a competitive match.

Becky Lynch, Carmella, Naomi vs. Natayla, Alexa Bliss, Nikki Bella - It should be noted that Eva Marie was originally scheduled to be a participant only to go on ""vacation"" being replaced by the returning Nikki Bella.  This multi-divas match featured such highlights one woman showcasing her athleticism from a unique variation to the legdrop to even a page out of her in-law's playbook only for that to top that with another doing a familiar move from a member from her legendary family, one woman using her gymnastics background, various women showcasing their educated feet including one team lined up in the corner for series of maneuvers, and eventually the action breaking down with all six women in a good solid match.

WWE Universal Championship Match: Finn Balor vs. Seth Rollins - A couple of notes here in that RAW Commissioner Stephanie McMahon & General Manager Mick Foley were at ringside while this match could only be won by pinfall or submission with the crowd making it clear how they felt about the physical appearance of the new championship.  Balor came into this match as ""The Demon King"" as he was able to deliver an impactful maneuver launching Seth into the corner & go aerial while Seth took the match to the outside utilizing the environment to his advantage only for Balor to do the same as the action as the action returned to the ring as both men targeted different areas of the body with various combinations & submissions utilized along with maneuvers not seen by them in WWE in an encounter so physical that one man didn't walk out unscathed.

Right around here was suppose to be United States Champion Rusev vs. Roman Reigns but the match never got started with both men brawling before the bell around ringside using whatever they could get their hands on with no one being able to break up the fight until one man was unable to compete while the other made sure he got the final word.

Brock Lesnar vs. Randy Orton - This was hyped as ""15 Years In The Making"" based off both men breaking into the business & arriving onto the main roster at around the same time as Brock came out very dominate brushing off Orton's offense taking him to ""Suplex City"" & over-powering him on the outside while Orton was able to capitalize on an opening taking Brock to ""Viperville"" with some of his signature offense before one man was able to take the other down & continue to dominate until he was unable to continue resulting in a result & scene afterwards not seen in WWE in a very long time as more than one body was left laying as this was very similar to Brock's SummerSlam match with Cena two years earlier where outside of a few offensive maneuvers from Orton that it was a very dominate performance of Brock's that didn't go long instead of being a more competitive encounter the match was hyped up to be.

(Kickoff Show) American Alpha, Hype Bros, Usos vs. Vaudvillians, Ascension, Breezango - SmackDown's tag team division faced off here in a rematch from the previous week with both teams trading momentum & having an opportunity to showcase themselves with the action eventually breaking down with all the teams & sequences of one big move after another from both the ground & air with the bigger story of not which team got the pin but how it happened.

(Kickoff Show) Sami Zayn & Neville vs. Dudley Boyz - Zayn & Neville used teamwork to get the advantage early on before the Dudleys used dirty tactics to get the advantage back attempting to single out one opponent from their partner & focus heavily on a specific area of the body in a solid encounter that came down to one team taking advantage of miscommunication.

(Kickoff Show) Cesaro vs. Sheamus - The first match in their ""Best Of Seven Series"" with each man attempting to go for a big signature move of theirs in the opening moments with both men trading strikes & countering the other's offense as both men continued to beat on each other with impactful offense that even hurt both men including taking risk not previously seen from them as it took one man resorting to certain tactics to get the victory in a physical match.

WWE has been attempting to make SummerSlam a ""WrestleMania"" of the summer which in this case delivered overall as superstars stepped up their game with strong performances utilizing offense that has been rarely if not ever seen by them before with some disappointments (quality of the main event, the U.S. Title match turned into a segment, John Steward's involvement in the Tag Title match) but overall enjoyed the show & recommend it for a viewing.",1472342400,2,7971,4.674037089871612
8763511,5,B01GU35K8W,"Maybe better than the 2017 Slam--maybe. At any rate, another 4-hour extravaganza with Jon Stewart talking about ""old man belly"" (Very funny). KO and Y2J as a curtain-jerker may be a shocker, but it was Enzo and Cass, so no big deal. Charlotte and Sasha had a great showing; and AJ and Cena stole the show.

No shocker for Cena to put AJ over 2 shows in a row--I guess Cena may still be dead after Mania '34. Anyway, I heard the good folks at the WWE may have piped in some crowd noise for the Universal Title match,. Hard for me to tell, but it was a great match, regardless.
