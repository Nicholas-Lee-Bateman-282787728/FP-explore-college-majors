There was a ""Megastructures"" episode on the National Geographic Channel shown on December 20, 2015, which was superbly done, totally complete, and much better in terms of information for the curious armchair traveler.  I do not recommend buying this Discovery Channel DVD unless one is satisfied with a partly-told bare-bones story.",1433894400,,443,5.391304347826087

8156509,5,B000KGGNSC,"If you are interested in Bridges and engineering in general, this is a must see DVD.
The way they constructed this bridge really pushed the engineering ""envelope.""

The final result is not only an amazing engineering feat; but one of the most aesthetically designed bridges I've ever seen.  It blends in perfectly with its environment; no easy task since the bridge (i.e., viaduct) spans an incredibly beautiful valley.  To all the men and women who had anything to do with the project, well done!",1281744000,,497,4.892857142857143
