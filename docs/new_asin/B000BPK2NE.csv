2436037,5,B000BPK2NE,"This is a great american band (one of the finest)

at their peak!

To me, Journey will never be the same, without

Steve Perry.

I have all their cds up until Steve left (or was fired).

The ""new"" Journey just does not & never will, live

up to those early days.

This is a real treat!

Now I hope  they release ""Frontiers & Beyond!""",1131580800,6,333,4.078125
2436038,4,B000BPK2NE,"I just happened to come across this disc recently and I have to say it's about time Journey released this show from 1981.  I thought I would go to the ""official Journey site"" and get some more information about this release.  Unfortunately there is no mention of this disc.  That's too bad.  I guess the riff between Journey and Steve Perry continues.  It will be interesting to see of this disc outsells Journey 2001.",1131580800,3,418,4.594594594594595
2436039,5,B000BPK2NE,"Journey, Live from Houston 81' was made in the infancy of MTV and at the pinnacle of Journey's success.  This is a highly anticipated release that will be a wonderful addition to any Music Video Libary.  Whether you are a seasoned Journey fan or just jumped on the bandwagon recently, you have GOT to get this DVD.  It is one, if not, the best concert that Journey (with Steve Perry) ever performed.  Journey, Live from Houston is a Get it now DVD!!!",1131494400,11,450,4.451219512195122
2436040,5,B000BPK2NE,"I have been waiting forever for them to get around to releasing this concert on DVD. We had a copy, taped from MTV, and played it until it was worn out. This is a great concert, by a great band.  If you love Journey, you won't be disappointed.",1130976000,5,243,4.0625
2436041,5,B000BPK2NE,"I heard about this yesterday on the radio and there was no doubt I would be ordering it.  I saw Journey several times during the 80's, so this is sure going to bring back some memories.  Journey is NOT Journey without the man and the voice...Steve Perry!",1130803200,5,254,4.382978723404255
2436042,5,B000BPK2NE,This is a definite MUST HAVE.  I ordered it a few days ago and am waiting for this must anticipated music event paitently.  A wonderful gift for Journey and Steve Perry fans.  The Houston concert was one of the best if not the best. So don't be sorry that you didn't order it. Do it now!,1130630400,7,287,4.089285714285714
2436043,5,B000BPK2NE,"I have the original on Beta tape. I played this over and over. Sure it is dated but this concert was excellent. Now in 5.1,even better.

Now if they will re-release Frontiers and Beyound.",1130284800,7,187,4.5

And for those who weren't there, and are still missing the one and only *VOICE*, Steve Perry, this is sure to be your favorite early Christmas present to yourself!!",1129420800,34,285,4.461538461538462
2436045,5,B000BPK2NE,"This is Journey at their finest with the classic Escape line up.  Its so awesome this concert exists so that many of us that didn't get the chance to Steve Perry with the band get to see him in his prime.  Journey just hasn't been the same since he left, the songs and albums are just not as good as when he was in the band.  I have seen Journey within the last two years, they sound fantastic but it still feels so incomplete.  Perry, his voice, his songwriting was an essential aspect to the success of the band and this concert is a great live documentation of that.  If Journey never tours again with him, and/or Perry never goes back on tour as a solo artist this may be one of the only full concert performance we get from the man, and that's okay.  Its always nice to be able to remember someone in their glory days.  Hope the rumors are true & you are coming out with new music this year Steve, we fans miss you!",1518566400,,920,4.134831460674158

2436048,4,B000BPK2NE,"Fine collection of Journey songs in concert on DVD, while Steve Perry was the lead singer.  The video quality is good, but not terrific, perhaps because the technology in 1981 wasn't what it is today.  Still, this is probably as good as can be purchased, and for Journey fans, you won't be disappointed.",1516838400,,303,4.69811320754717

2436066,3,B000BPK2NE,"It's just ok. The version of ""Wheel in the Sky"" is irritatingly fast. It sounds like it was sped up in the recording studio like info-mercials are so you have to listen to more information in the same amount of time. It is not anywhere near my favorite of the Journey albums. Most of the album feels as if the timing is off. I feel like I'm being rushed. Also, I don't care for any of the solo's. Captured is a better ""live"" album. I would recommend the original Escape album over this one.",1495756800,,490,4.223404255319149
2436067,5,B000BPK2NE,A group of very talented musicians who put on a great concert.  This is probably Journey at their best!  Highly recommended.,1494201600,,124,4.857142857142857

2436071,5,B000BPK2NE,"This is certainly a classic!  It brings you back to a time where music was pure and not fabricated.  Nobody had heard of Autotune yet and elaborate stage shows with back up dancers and props were still yet to come.  This captures the pure essences of the musicians, THE VOICE, the talent and the energy that we still lives on over 35 years later!.  If you are a Journey fan or just even like a few of the songs, this is a must...nobody in this day sounds like this LIVE.  Today, when you go to a concert, you almost expect a band to sound different that what you hear on an album...not on this DVD....I sear they sound as good, if not better live than on an album. I have and will be watching this over and over...I highly recommend adding to this to your collection!",1481500800,12,767,4.226027397260274

2436081,5,B000BPK2NE,"I am rediscovering Journey and so miss this time in my life when music was really music. Steve Perry...what can you say that hasn't already been said about this man. Very few artists are better live than recorded. Steve Perry is one of them. If you love real music with real singing and real instruments and  without all the modern distractions, this DVD is for you.  The quality of this DVD is terrific and you can feel the energy from the music and audience.  I was too young to appreciate this band when they came out in the 70's and grew up on their 80's staple so when I bought this DVD I was so impressed and went back and bought all their albums and could not believe how much I had been missing. I cannot believe this band has been snubbed over and over by the music establishment. But then again, I don't often agree with critics. Steve Perry and Journey at their absolute peak!",1469664000,20,887,4.331325301204819

2436094,5,B000BPK2NE,This may be the best live concert ever captured in rock & roll. Amazing vocals and nearly flawless guitars. The band sounds amazing and the setlist is powerful. Some of Journey's best. Don't Stop Believin' alone is so amazing live on this DVD that it's worth having for that. This is the best you will ever hear a lead singer capture their original recording sound. Steve Perry shows he can do nearly anything live. Amazing to think he was not their original lead singer. 10/10. A must DVD or download for ANY Rock Fans. Amazing. (Eagles in Melbourne and Van Halen Live Without a Net are also 10/10 live concert videos.),1455321600,9,620,4.594594594594595

2436096,5,B000BPK2NE,Great concert. Wish when they put it to DVD it would of been real nice to have it remixed to have Dolby 5.1 Surround sound to it so to enhance the sound quality and the performance of the show when you have a 5.1 sound system where for me here I have a 7.1 to bring out the concert sound quality but I am enjoy it as I type this review and glad I got it here and sure brings back some awesome memories of my childhood when I was young. Thanks so much!!!!,1454803200,,454,3.8404255319148937
2436097,4,B000BPK2NE,"Steve Perry is unbelievable! The guy's voice is phenomenal. The video quality is just ok. The version I got is not wide screen and is an old video format, so is not anywhere near HD quality.

Frontiers, Raised on Radio, etc. to add to our library of Journey with Steve Perry.",1453593600,,331,4.610169491525424
2436101,3,B000BPK2NE,"I was in high school in 1981 and although I own most of Journeys albums, its this incarnation of Journey to which I relate the most. As this is a review of this performance I have to say that although ostensibly at the top of their game, their performance was rushed.  It was like they were flying through their set to get to another gig or perhaps keep the concert under an hour and a half to appease the MTV producers.  I realize that to some this is considered the high energy behavior of the concert venue, but it looked to me like the band might have done a little blow before the show.  After all it WAS the 80s Just sayin.
Regarding the sound and visuals:  The 5.1 is what prompted me to get this because I wanted to better experience the concert venue through a high-end A/V system. Sadly, its nothing special.  Its a lean and shrill mix with little mid to low end warmth.  The disc notes say Spectacular new sound and picture and that this was a Brand new stereo and 5.1 mix from the original tapes.  If thats true, I really wonder what the original looked and sounded like!
 Visually the new picture is fair to poor.  I realize that it was done several years ago and its in no way high definition, but there are other 80s concerts that fare better visually than this one.  It appears to be a straight VHS tape to DVD transfer complete with mis-tracking and visual tape noise.
Regarding the extras, although short and choppy the interviews are a real blast from the past.  Interesting to see Neil and the others so young.  The couch they are sitting on in their interviews looks like something straight off the set of the Brady Bunch!  The Escape TV promo is quintessentially 80s and Im not sure I needed the crowd noise with the slide show or the original aired closing credits but they're there anyway.
A nice trip down memory lane but not one Ill take too many more times because to me sonically and visually this is just fair.",1450656000,6,1939,4.367688022284122

2436103,5,B000BPK2NE,"Ive been a journey fan since the early days, but never got to see them in concert. Boy, did I miss something incredible. There are lots of bands that sound good on recording, but don't have the same ability or punch live. That does NOT describe Journey. The guys in the band are incredible, especially Steve Perry. His abilities and range live are just amazing.

The only complaint I have is when it came out. There are songs from later albums I would have loved to have included on this DVD. But, oh well, you cant have everything.

If you own only one concert DVD, this should be the one!",1446854400,,590,4.3545454545454545

This is the full concert they played in Houston in '81 - all the big hits are played as well as some of the lesser known, very nice songs.  (Mother, father comes to mind).

It is a classic, cheesy, delightful romp through the early 80s.  Steve Perry is simply beautiful in his nut-busting Levis, leopard wife beater and tux jacket.

2436147,5,B000BPK2NE,"I wasn't even a big Journey fan back in those days, but I was familiar with their music and liked them well enough.  Lately, I've been buying concert DVDs from different eras, including those good ol' days, and it made sense to include Journey, especially since their recent 'rebirth' with Arnel Pineda at center stage has caught my attention.  Well, the verdict is that I really like this DVD, the songs are great and the band performs them with an abundance of energy.  Some things that stood out for me:

- The video quality isn't bad, and the sound quality is even better.  Quite acceptable for a concert of this vintage.

- The stage show is pleasantly simple and pure, not even much change in lighting.  Just a bunch of great musicians wearing jeans and jumping around with enthusiasm as they play their music for a large live audience.

- Steve Perry's voice sounds like it comes from heaven, absolutely soul-stirring.  Yes, Pineda is great too, hat's off to him, but Perry still has an extra something special.

- To my ear, from today's vantage point, many of these older Journey songs have a strikingly operatic quality.  And of course, Perry's singing is a big part of that.

- I was really impressed with Neal Schon's guitar playing (and I'm a guitarist myself), he's better than I remember.  He makes that guitar sing!

Overall, a very enjoyable performance.  Recommend to fans of 80s rock music, and especially to Journey fans.",1390262400,,1441,4.708

2436155,4,B000BPK2NE,"I was like many of my peers growing up in the 80s/90s music scene... mostly into hard rock, and was somewhat turned off by the overly 'pop' bands of the same period. So like many of us, I probably thought deep down that Journey was a quality group, and the music was good, but refused to acknowledge it. Now that we're all older, wiser (right...), and at least somewhat 'matured'... I have found listening to the 'classics' on vinyl, has me reforming my preheld notions.

I wanted to try and capture/listen to the group in their prime, and based on the many Amazon reviewers, I picked this as the best resource to relive it. With the focus on hard rock growing up, many interested in the said genre were impressed by the better vocalists: Dio, Halford, Cornell, Geoff Tate (when we had time to consider anyone beyond the guitar heroes); but those guys are put to shame when you hear someone like Perry singing live as captured in this DVD - a truly, superlative vocal talent. It's a must-have for all appreciators of the 80/90s music scene, just do your best to ignore the wacky fashion sense of the time. (it's bad...)",1377216000,13,1119,4.53960396039604

Who else has typed in ""blu-ray live"" and any other host of keyword combinations here at amazon, only to find the same tiny list pop up? I mean, it's Journey in 1981, right? Why isn't this available on blu-ray?

Well, having caved in and bought the DVD, I can affirm that this is one instance where blu-ray might actually have diminished the viewing experience. I'm fairly certain that people are taking better concert footage with their cell phones these days. This concert looks like it was shot as an after thought to fill up the empty video cassette that was left over after someone's wedding. Sometimes, it's almost painful to watch. And the band members' jeans, along with flashes of high school talent show stage presence, don't help.

Steve Perry is amazing, though. If nothing else, this video confirms that he is the heart, soul, and most awesome talent of the band.

The mixing of the music is just about as bad as the video, but I suppose that, on a Trans Am's 8-track, this would've sounded just fine. All-in-all, this video captures the era during which it was made--the bad, the ugly . . . and the epic radio passion.",1348963200,,1204,4.564814814814815

2436201,5,B000BPK2NE,"If you have ever enjoyed even one tune by Journey, do your ears a flavor and check out this live show from probably the best month of their entire career.

Recorded in Houston on the Escape tour in 1981, three weeks after that classic album hit number one, this show is just flat out smokin' from moment one (a killer version of Escape) all the way to the final Perry wail. They are all obviously super-duper-psyched to achieve every rock band's wettest dream: touring behind the number one record on the planet. And man, are these guys happening on this night. Of course, it's all about That Voice.

Steve Perry! The dude was a vocal GOD. As a teenager at the time I liked a lot of their tunes, but Journey was lumped in with Foreigner, .38 Special, REO and other ""corporate rock"" bands as just too commercial to be cool. Zeppelin, Sabbath, Beatles, Stones, Who: that was still the stuff that ruled the high school parking lots. Only chicks listened to Journey...which the smart guys took note of, hanging out at the shows and meeting endless girls, while the guys at the Rush and Sabbath shows banged their heads while occasionally noticing the absence of said babes.

The girls knew what guys like me passed by way too fast: Journey had the best lead singer, musically, since the mighty Zep itself. Plus Perry knew how to write ultimate chick ballads (Open Arms is STILL the top AOR song), could rock hard when he wanted to, was always musical and really understood how to use his crazy huge voice.

Watching this 30 years later, having sung and played guitar for a living for most of the '90s, I can only marvel at Perry's staggering abilities. Not only his range and power, but his incredibly reliable ear. This guy ain't NEVER pitchy, dawg! How do you go for that many soaring notes way up there and never dump one even a quarter tone? Only this guy and Dio seem to know, and Steve uses so little vibrato that he blows even Ronnie James away for sheer technical perfection and tonal intensity.

Watch him here for a master class in rock singing; seriously, there's a ton to be learned from this show for any singer. First thing I noticed was how straight his back always is, and how he really opens his throat up at almost all times....hence that seemingly easy power and accuracy. He works the entire stage, almost DLR-style, and hits every dang note dead on even while running. He also anticipates the lyric and puts himself in the right place in the right time, by the drums, keys, etc. The man paid serious attention.

Steve is a true vocal artist, and even if you don't dig his music watch how he hits those notes with his whole body; he's as operatic in the best ways as no other rocker except maybe Freddie Mercury. And the aggressive, intense apporach to every note, plus the soaring swoops and runs, make me think of a truly great lead guitarist as much as a singer. Perry's best vocals sound at times to me like a classic David Gilmour solo, tone and all, and that's a supreme musical compliment.

Steve was a straight-up professional, and I also love how un-wasted he and the boys are here. Ain't it nice when a band gives you more than your money's worth?

Anyhow, enough marveling at Perry. Everyone else in the band is in fine form, especially drummer Steve Smith, whose propulsive groove and tight pocket really make things pop. Schon plays his recorded solos mostly note for note, for better or worse, and while to me he's a little too predictable and generic at times (and nowhere near Perry's level), he still delivers the intensity.

Even though Neal was a founding member of Journey, by 1981 this was clearly Perry's band, and he sings so insanely well on this show, with so much passion and precision, that to have it in this quality with nice slow camera work and near-perfect remastered sound is as close to heaven as any hardcore Journey fan could ask for. And even I, a mere Journey enjoyer, must admit that any band would kill to have been in that magic place, on top of the rock world when it still rocked, and to have played a show for posterity that's as tight and crisp as this.

Maybe the best thing about this dvd is that the picture and sound are A-1, with almost no quick cuts from one shot to the next to the next, every second. We get a shot of Perry or Schon or whomever for ten or even thirty seconds. Yes!! I want to watch a musician working his ax for a while; I don't want to see how many cuts an editor can make with his. This very early MTV production displays all the right things they would stop doing a few years later, helping kill the art of live rock video in the process. Now it's all nausea-inducing one second cuts.

But this near-perfect filming is just the music, with a few nice cheesy screen effects, and that's all we need, and want.

If every band had a dvd this perfect, the world would be at peace and we would all be living in perfect harmony.

Ok, maybe not, but Steve Perry is still the best lead guitarist to never pick up a guitar.",1312588800,6,5002,4.435729847494553

Take a trip back to 1981 and enjoy the show.",1312156800,3,383,3.7974683544303796

Some of Journey's best songs are included, sung by Steve Perry, such as:  Who's Cryin'Now, Don't Stop Believin' and Anyway You Want It.",1309996800,2,420,4.4868421052631575
2436204,5,B000BPK2NE,"For anyone who grew up listening to Journey this is an awesome DVD!  It brings you back to the days of the early 80's and gets you reminiscing about a time when the world was a little less complex, a little simpler.
The music is powerful and Steve Perry's vocals are at times spellbinding.  There will never be another Steve Perry, and Journey was never and will never be the same without him.  This DVD capture Steve and the band in their heyday, and you can tell they were having a lot of fun performing.
I have also seen the ""new"" Journey performance, ""Live in Manila"" with Arnel Pineda. Although he has a great voice and one that closely resembles Steve Perry's, he is not Steve Perry, and although one can enjoy and appreciate their music, us Steve Perry loyalists just cannot accept this band as being ""Journey"".
That distinct sound of Steve's vocals, together with Neil's guitar, Ross' bass, Jonathan's piano/keyboard, and Steve Smith's drums created a kind of musical magic that in my opinion will never be (and CAN NEVER BE) replicated, and will live on in musical history to become legendary.
Seeing this Escape Live DVD made me yearn for a Journey reunion with Steve Perry.
Unfortunately, it seems this will never happen.  Can you imagine the worldwide response if it did??  I believe it would become the biggest selling reunion tour in history.
Bottom line is:  If you like the Journey of the 70's, 80's and early 90's, then you must have this DVD!  For less than $12.00 it's a steal!",1307923200,5,1496,4.622641509433962

2436207,5,B000BPK2NE,"Journey's Live in Houston 1981 : The Escape Tour CD and DVD was released in November of 2005.
The year 1981 was the year the rock band Journey (based in San Fancisco, CA) ruled the American rock music landscape as their then-latest album Escape hit #1 on the Billboard album chart and they were possibly, aside Canadian rockers Rush and the Chicago based rockers Styx, the best concert act from the US and Canada touring the United States in 1981. In fact, Journey were so big that they opened a few shows for The Rolling Stones (whom retured to the road in 1981 in support of Tattoo You (Journey opened up for Mick and Keith and the lads in 1978 for a few shows as well)) before embarking on the tour in support of their Escape album.
This 1981 concert was recorded and filmed at The Houston Summit in Houston, TX that November (with Canadian rockers Loverboy (who had just released their Get Lucky album) opening up for Journey) and this Journey performance originally aired on MTV (when it stood for Music TeleVision, not REALITY TV like it is now).
For years, this classic Journey concert was not available on either DVD or VHS nor even on an audio format but it is now. This Journey concert features the classic line up with lead singer Steve Perry, guitarist Neal Schon, then new keyboard player/occasional rhythm guitarist Jonathan Cain, bass player Ross Valory and drummer(and my fellow Bay Stater (Massachusetts) native) Steve Smith.
The Escape Tour sees Journey at the top of their game.
On this CD and DVD set, the band played eight of the Escape album's ten tracks (the set opening title cut (with a killer fanfare riff to begin the tune), ""Open Arms"", ""Mother Father"", ""Who's Crying Now"", ""Dead or Alive"", ""Don't Stop Believin'"", ""Stone in Love"" and ""Keep on Runnin'"") as well as songs from 1978's Infinity (""Lights"" and set closer ""Wheel in the Sky""), 1979's Evolution (the first encore ""Lovin' Touchin' Squeezin'""), 1980's Departure (""Line of Fire"", ""Where Were You"" and the final encore ""Any Way You Want It"") and the studio track from 1981's double live album Captured (""The Party's Over (Hopelessly In Love)"" which is on the CD only) plus solos from messieurs Cain on the piano as a link between ""Mother Father"" and ""Who's Crying Now"", Smith (who does a superb drum solo which starts at the end of ""Where Were You"") and Schon (whose solo serves as a link between ""Keep on Runnin'"" and ""Wheel In the Sky"").
The sound quality of the CD and DVD set is incredible (superbly mixed by Allan Sides and wonderfully remastered by Bob Ludwig) and the digi-pak type packaging, which includes a 16-page booklet is excellent as well.
The extras on the DVD portion are interviews filmed during the 1981/82 timeframe with Journey's calssic lineup, the ending credits from when MTV aired the show in 1982, the Escape album promo commercial and photo gallery and all are top notch.
Overall, Journey Live in Houston is a great value for your buck. Thank you to Steve Perry for helping restore the true Journey legacy.

2436227,3,B000BPK2NE,"Mainly based upon an American Journey's Tour (culminating into a couple of concerts in Houston and Cleveland) supporting the hit album ""Escape"" on 1981, you can find some other sessions within a 4 months effort at MTV, inside the present DVD live (dated 2005). But of course their main show- taken on November 6, 1981 and featuring the most famous line up with Neal Schon, Steve Perry, Jonathan Cain, Ross Valory and Steve Smith- is not always on the most inspiring side of AOR rock. Nevertheless there are always their biggest hit singles...even though- apart from the passion and strong vocal interpretation as well by S. Perry- I'm a little bit disturbed when I listen to a kind of ""boogie rock"" entitled ""Line of fire"" and sometimes tired too, owing to their usual ballads, such as ""Lights"", ""Stay Awhile"", and ""Open Arms"".
Anyway- fortunately- ""Mother/Father"" is one of the most ""convincing"" and heavier songs from ""Escape"", and above all it's not a commercial hit!! Then I like the guitar solo by N. Schon within ""Who's Crying Now"", this latter being a ballad in the opening section, but growing by means of the emotional feeling expressed in the guitar line of the following section...at the end I wait for ""Wheel In The Sky"", probably the best example regarding the style of the guitarist; nevertheless the easy melodic soloings by Neal have been often appreciated also in the pop hits. Moreover I like to mention the excellent production quality (if you consider the record dated 1981!!), with the support of MTV, performing a very good job here- as long as you find an additional song, ""The Party's Over"" , combined with the Escape TV Promo (this latter enriched by means of the interviews) , which all together make this product of ""AOR"" music quite an important event. In fact They were able to witness the most melodic moments, according to the typical mood of the early eighties, in the Golden Age of such an interesting American simple rock (however equal to Styx and Boston, just to mention a couple of bands with the same style within that period...).

An interesting film for an easy melodic rock-I mean, from a shrewd ever-green band! You know that I prefer the effective prog music genre, in comparison to the world of prog related or AOR music but- talking about Journey- I recognize their importance inside the world of pop music... at the end- for me- it could be enough to think of giving it over an half star in the evaluation, at least!!",1275782400,,2463,4.7546728971962615

If there is anything less than perfect, it is stage presence.  Steve Perry was one of the top 10 male vocalists of the rock era.  On the other hand, when it came to stage presence, he never could produce the charisma, the outrageousness, the excitement, of other lead singers.  As a result, when you see the album, you will say, wow...what a great voice...but not sense anything more than just hearing the same piece on radio.",1272931200,,542,4.336633663366337

Pretty much if you read my Live in Houston CD review...here's a link ([...]) you know this was taken at the height of their popularity with the Escape album. The CD was an amazement on it's own because it gave me a feel for live Journey but listening only scratched the surface, this completely blew live Journey out for me. Considering that before I got this, I have never seen Journey live except for in videos on the internet but the quality wasn't like this. The video quality is still amazing for something that was recorded almost 30 years ago and the sound quality is better than the CD's quality but that's understandable. Speaking of the CD, the quality on this CD might be better than the individual CD that came out a year later but I think that's only because I stopped listening to my individual CD. The DVD contains lots of Extras such as a slide show, the original credits from the broadcast, a band interview, and the promo for Escape which was pretty cool to finally watch. This concert was recorded for the fledgling MTV and for awhile it was unavailable for the longest of times up until a few years back and now it is.

Other than that this is the perfect concert for Journey fans.  It is Steve Perry at his finest and his finest was something to hear.  Can any man alive today hit notes like that?

I've since seen live Journey with the faux Steve and still enjoy but if I could only go back or possibly convince Steve Perry to tour once more for my sake I would.  This was the next best thing.  I viewed on a traditional DVD system but put headphones on for the full stereo affect.  I enjoyed it from start to finish and enjoy the extras as well regarding the start up of the legendary band, where everyone came from, it was very enjoyable.  Today, Live, Neal will drive you insane with his 15 minute solos, his solo in this was tolerable and very good.  Steve Smith I have not seen live, he's impressive.  I highly recommend this to anyone who was deprived of Live Journey as a child as I was, I was 10 when I got my first album and I'm so glad I did.",1178668800,3,842,4.005988023952096

2436315,3,B000BPK2NE,"I got this DVD because I love Journey and the ratings given were very good.  The song selection was perfect and the band sounded great, but......Steve Perry found it necessary to demonstrate that he could run and I mean RUN from one side of the stage to the other while singing and still have enough wind to finish the song.  He could do it; however, while it was a novelty on the first two songs it became a real distraction after doing it for the entire DVD.  I don't see the problem with standing relatively still and singing a song.  Apparently, that was just too much for Perry to handle.  It became such a annoyance that I cannot watch this stupid DVD any more.  The only saving grace is that his running around could become a great drinking game.  Every time he takes off, everybody take a drink.  There would be nobody standing by the end of the DVD.",1172102400,9,858,4.352201257861635

I don't really consider the second DVD release (Journey 2001) without Steve Perry, because in my opinion it's not the original Journey that I grew up with. Considering the age of this show, you get an amazing 1981 concert DVD from their Escape Tour with an impressive picture and excellent Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound.

The transfer to DVD from the original MTV concert release is pretty good. The 5.1 mix isn't all that impressive, Steve Smith's snare sounds like it's sitting on the couch with you, but hey, whaddya want from a format that was 2 channel from inception. I'm rarely ever impressed with 2 channel to 5.1 channel mixdowns. The stereo mix is great, and actually trumps the 5.1.(That's funny, I don't remember the performance from the middle of the stage). Everything sounds so much more natural in stereo. More like I remembered. I had to give this 5 stars just because of the nostalgia factor, but realisically I think I'd have given it a 4 had I not actually been at the show. The performance was great, and the work transfered well, but 5 stars represents perfection to me and the whole package is far from perfect. Presentation in the original aspect ratio would have been nice, as well.

Journey gives a fantastic concert performance for Houston along with solos of Steve Smith, Jonathan Cain, and Neil Schon.

2436333,5,B000BPK2NE,"I can only add to the good things said about this DVD - it is a joy to have this professionally produced, crisp-sounding production available. This is a classic performance and a tour de force for Perry - hearing this only shows, again, how good a vocalist he really is - from powerful to haunting to tender to rocking out.  I am very happy Perry worked on the production and that all the band gave permission for this - I continue to wish that hidden gems of footage would be made available (such as a little-known early Largo, MD show w. Greg Rolie) or some of the early TV work - remember the Midnight Special with Wolfman Jack?

Say what you will about the 80's, the arena shows, the ""hair bands"", the music, was a blast - and I cherish this classic footage from my favorite singer/band - wish they would release more (don't make us wait 20 years more for some Time-Life collection!!!)  10 stars ********************!!!!!!!",1157500800,9,927,4.538922155688622

The recording is pretty clean: Steve Perry's incomparable vocals cut through the music pumped out by Neal Schon and the rest of the band. The remastered music lets you hear how special Steve Perry's voice is and how much of master Neal Schon was/is on guitar. One criticism: The drums are a little lost in the mix, but the amazing setlist (primarily made up of songs from Escape), the vocal harmonies (from the whole band), and the blistering solos make up for it. It's a great look/listen back at one of the most influencial---and exciting---bands from the 80s. Let me write another cliche for you: This is a must-have for all Journey (new and old) fans!

2436338,5,B000BPK2NE,"Journey's Escape Tour came to the Cleveland Coliseum just a few weeks after my 14th birthday.  I had no car, no money and parents who suspected that things went on at rock concerts that they had to protect me from.  It seemed like the entire neighborhood was going, and at school it was the only thing anyone talked about for the next week.  The girls all had magazine pictures of Steve Perry taped inside their lockers.

All I had to sustain me was the ""Escape"" album in LP vinyl, and my friends and I literally wore it out over the next several years, with all of us coming of age in what seemed like months, all to the soundtrack of Journey and a few other bands.  By the time the ""Frontiers"" tour came to town, I was old enough to go but I had moved on to other bands, and besides we all sensed that ""Escape"" had been the pinnacle, and that Journey was morphing into a band for girls.

So I am grateful beyond words that MTV happened to capture this night in Houston with such high quality video and sound.  The band is simply at their technical and spiritual peak, and they are riding a wave of unbelievable power since, as Steve Perry mentions during the concert, the ""Escape"" album had gone number one just three weeks earlier.

Disco had ended, Progressive was still coming, MTV had arrived but hadn't figured out quite what it was yet, and Journey was the biggest thing in America in 1981.  This DVD captures that moment, and what's truly amazing for us rock connoisseurs is how sparse and basic their stage show is here.  The musicians stand on stage with their gear, they blow our minds out with their playing, Steve Perry runs around and some primitive pyros explode at the beginning and the end, and aside from that, pretty much nothing else happens except that everyone in the audience goes nuts and most of the girls probably wet their pants.  It's a basic, fundamental, unbelievably well played and well sung rock concert by a band that was on the rocket ride they had worked towards for years.

If you missed this concert too, this DVD will almost make up for it.  It certainly stands up to time, and they play and sound better than you would think was humanly possible.",1148774400,94,2187,4.451127819548872

2436351,5,B000BPK2NE,"while reading Sarita's review, i could tell she is a true fan, even though some of the items stated are not quite factual.

i saw Journey on that tour.  it was my second concert with the amazing mr. Steve Perry fronting a great rock band.  i was very pleased to know that i had also seen them while recording the live album on May 22, 1980 in Cincy.  on the first show, there was the great Greg Rolie who had done a lot of the lead vocals for Journey in the early Pre-Perry album offerings.  and Greg was a pretty good vocalist, having sung ""Black Magic Woman"" with Santana where he got hooked up with Neal.

on the Escape tour, we were introduced to Jonathon Cain, formerly of The Babies (who opened for Journey on the Captured recording tour).  JC brought a new flair to Journey in that he could also play guitar and got into the writing effort that helped make Journey more hits.  (He wrote Faithfully)  he's also got a decent voice on him as his solo projects show.

I've seen the new Journey and while Steve A. is a very good vocalist that sustains the Journey sound we old timers have become used to, he's not even close to the performer that Steve Perry was in his time as front man.  Steve A. looks the same leaving the stage at the end of the show as he did in the first song.  SP was covered in sweat 3 songs in.  and he never stopped moving while the music played.

i recently bought the new cd, Generations.  it's good. so was Arrival, Steve A.'s first full length cd with the boys.  but if you want to see GREAT Journey, this Houston show is the one to have.  I recorded it in 1982 on vhs when it ran on tv one night.  i've since lost the tape, but the show was almost as good on tape as it was in Cincy.  NOBODY sang with as much energy at a full run as SP could.  Nobody holds a note like Steve Perry.

It's rumored that Steve A. had also given up on getting into the music business because he was continuously told he sounded too much like Steve Perry and we already had one of those!  as they say, close but no cigar.  I'll still go see them when they come around, no doubt about it.  But if you are a recent fan of Journey, do yourself a favor and see where they come from, the foundation that this kick ass band was built on.  Neal is one of the greatest guitar players ever in the history of rock n roll as far as i'm concerned, but Steve Perry made the band great.  i can still remember the first time i heard the Infinity album and heard Steve Perry sing ""Lights"".  I was blown away.

by the way, ""open Arms"" reached number 2 and was as close to a #1 hit as they got.  The did get a Grammy nomination for ""when you love a woman"" off of the ""trial by fire"" cd.  what a nice piece of recognition after a 10+ year absence.

no matter what problems they had that caused them to part company, Steve Perry was the heart of Journey and there will not be another one like him ever.  often imitated, never duplicated.  get the DVD, see the real deal.  see why they have ""Generations"" of fans.",1144886400,5,3005,4.115318416523236
2436352,5,B000BPK2NE,"I grew up listening to Journey as a child. One of their songs from the ""Frontiers"" CD called ""Troubled Child"" saved my life as a teenager. The words from that song reaced out to me, set me on a different path away from destruction. These 2 DVD's

'Journey Live in Houston 81-82-Tour & Journey Greates Hits 1978-1997' are a magnificent history into the band, veteran's like myself and new fans of Journey have come to know and love. I've read many reviews about this and other Journey DVD's, some good, some bad, and some I asked myself ""why would someone be so

mean and point fingers and write something so unkind and untrue?"".

To my personal opinionated, knowledge, I do not feel Steve Perry put out these 2 compilations just to remind everyone as to what an amazing singer he is. Or to remind anyone of the fact that he was lead singer, or to tout his own horn. I personally feel Steve's motivation was to let new fans of Journey see the group, for what they originally started out as. And to give a musical, visual, history of Journey. Everyone,

veteran fans and new fans alike have their opinion as to who, what and why Journey broke up. But I've yet to read anything close to the truth. Rather just mean-spirited comments aimed at either Neal or Steve. When in truth it was neither gentleman's

fault, that the band departed without Steve P. It was time and circumstances that severed the Steve P. and Journey relationship. So here is the real history: Neal Schon is the FOUNDER of Journey. Originally Journey was SUPPOSE to be an

ACOUSTIC/INSTRUMENTAL type band, the way of Santana. Neal Schon at 15 was given the chance of a lifetime to play in Santana, he later would also play with Eric Clapton's then band ""Derek and The Dominoes. Neal did not see the latter band lasting too long and decided to branch out and form a band of his own JOURNEY.

They got medicore reviews and some gigs here and there but the acoustic Journey band thing was just not happening. Neal held on to his dream for the band, like a pitbull, full steam ahead, playing acoustic gigs until his manager Herbie Herbert informed Neal, that Columbia, their current record company was going to drop them unless they started turning out a profit. As they were, the acoustic Journey thing, was losing the Columbia record company money, poor sales and low to no fan base. The company told Herbie to do something to ""turn the band around"" or they'd be dropped immediately.

Sometime later Neal tried a lead singer for the band, their first time performing with the guy, the entire band was booed from the stage. The new ""lead singer"" thing did not gel well with the band or Neal's vision of Journey. Neal went back to his

original acoustic format of Journey. He did not care if the company dropped his band, he'd carry on. However his manager Herbie ""Love Bug"" Herbert saw greater potential in Journey beyond Neal's vision of it. He also had a demo from a virtually

unknown singer, who was amazing, but in a band falling apart. That person was Steve Perry, the band he was in were on the verge of falling apart. The band's drummer had recently been killed in a car accident. It took the wind out of Steve Perry's sails, so to speak, upon learning about the death of his band mate. Steve was close to the deceased drummer and the band was on the verge of being signed before the death. It was too much for Steve, he swore off music and got a job working for his uncle repairing Turkey coups on a local farm, swearing to never sing again. Meanwhile an unknown angel, thought Steve had far too much potential to not be big in the music business, by throwing it away to be a turkey coup repair man, so this unknown angel sent a demo tape of Steve singing with his previous defunct band, to Herbie Herbert.

Herbert was looking for the right man to be lead singer of Journey, against Neal Schons wishes and stubborn protestions of NO LEAD SINGERS in Journey. Thank God Herbie the manager knew better. He listened to the demo of Steve Perry singing and decided then and there that Steve would be the new lead singer of Journey. Neal was not open to the idea but he had no choice, it was either try another lead singer, or lose your record contract. Not to mention oweing the record company millions of dollars in loss profits that acoustic Journey did not make. Though Neal did not make it easy or pleasant for Steve Perry. He became an intrical necessary part of Journey. In time, as Neal saw how the live audiences responded to Steve Perry as lead singer, he felt ""this just might work."" As time went on Journey with their new lead singer became a major force in Rock and Roll. Steve Perry as front man started to attract something new in the Journey audiences ""females"" where as before the

'acoustic Journey' had a male to female audience, with the ratio of males out numbering the females. Steve's amazing vocals turned all that around. Perry's voice and unmatched

vocals were so overpowering, that when written about in music trade papers and reviews, the critics and fans alike were calling it ""Steve Perry & Journey"" or ""Steve Perry's Journey"". Naturally this caused bitterness in Schon towards Perry,

he felt Perry was taking credit for a band he Schon created. But Steve could no more control what people wrote about the band or how they wrote it, no more than he could avoid not being the amazing singer he was. Feeling uncredited and pushed out of the spotlight, Neal made it tough for Steve in Journey, especially when it came to songs. Steve Perry and Jonathan Cain had worked on a song called ""Open Arms"", Cain had the song for years but was unable or too unsure the song would ever become anything. Steve heard the melody of ""Open Arms"" and encouraged Cain to come to his home, where the two collaborated and reworked the song, which became one of many of Journey's #1 hits. Not only that, but Open Arms was also a crossover success. It started to get airplay on black urban radio. Which was unheard of for a white rock band, at that time. It was a first in the history of Rock and Roll. A rock group had broken through to the R&B market, gaining not only a new audience of fans but a black audience fan following. Open Arms became a requested favorite on many R&B radio stations, especially on the ""midnight love"" hour. Neal, who felt the song was too sappy, highly protested the group even recording the song,

and did not want it to be on the album Escape. Finally Steve had proven himself to be a formidable collaborater and song writer within the group. Neal had to give Steve credit and Cain, for giving the band their first crossover #1, which gained the group Journey an even larger fan base than ever before. Although he still gave Steve a hard time, and their relationship as band mates, would always be 'rocky', Neal finally accepted Steve as an official part of the band. By the time the Frontiers album started coming about, the band had already been through some heady and internal changes. But as brothers in music they stuck it out and stayed together playing on. Then Steve Perry's mother was stricken with Cancer, she had been fighting the disease for years and had recovered. This time she was losing the fight, this affected Steve's ability to perform. He separated himself from his bandmates while on tour, and with every chance he got, he flew back home to be at his Mother's side. Steve had a helicopter waiting at every recording session for the Frontiers album, in case his Mom's condition took a turn for the worse. This caused considerable upheavel among the other band members. Steve chose to keep his pain private and shut out his bandmates and in doing so the riff between him and the others began to grow.

It would be a riff that would only get stronger, by time and more uncertain circumstances.

After his Mom's passing, Steve pulled it together and focused on Journey again, but the others especially Neal, never forgot how Steve acted or treated them. The other bandmates experienced life changes as well, divorces, etc, but Journey always stayed together. Eventually Steve P. Neal S. Steve S. and Jonathan C. would all go on to do or work on solo projects during breaks from Journey. These solo projects would also be the start, of rumours that the band was breaking up, but to the chagrin of many critics and other hard core rock artist, who didn't consider Journey to be Rock and Roll sounding, Journey reunited and continued to run circles around many. Breaking record sales, live stadium attendance records, and making critics eat crow, by putting out albums that fans snatched up like hot hams at Christmas. During that time, some felt Steve was taking too much control in Journey. Steve's side was merely, he wanted more input and producing control, over and on the songs he had to sing as front man. He didn't think it was asking too much, but as he probably did not recall, Neal and others in the band, still held it against Steve for what they deemed 'snotty' behavoiur towards them when his Mom died. So Steve had to fight for writing credits and song control, which he eventually won because the songs he wrote for and with the band are the ones that sold the most records. Time and circumstance. The band had taken a long break, then came back together to try to give it a shot after many years apart. The album would be titled Trial by Fire, an ironic, if not aptly titled CD especially for Steve P. Old wounds had been healed and the past forgiven, so they thought. During a break in the recording sessions for TBF, Steve took a short vacation in Hawaii where he made the decision to go rock climbing. Something he'd always done before a tour, to unwind and relax. It would prove to be the catalyst to the ending of his career with Journey. During the climb Steve P. fell and injured his left side, mainly his hip. When he got back to the states he was already in excruiating pain. He checked himself into the Hospital. He was told that he had to have hip-replacement surgery, and that it was not to be entered into lightly. He was told that he could die on the operating table. The news hit Steve and the band real hard. What was harder was the fact that the band had been informed through their manager that the record company wanted them on the road ASAP! Also many in the band were going through financial hardship, so sales from a huge tour was to serve to be a saviour for many in the band. Ross Valory in particular had gotten himself into a bind financially, with his home about to be foreclosed on, this tour meant a way out. By providing him with an income he so desperately needed. The others had obligations to family, and child support, to deal with. the Trial by Fire Tour, was just that. A Trial! Steve, after talking it over with the doctors, and family, decided to forego surgery until later. The band felt however, that he should have the surgery, get healed, go through rehabilitation and get his butt ready to get on the road. Steve felt the band was being unreasonable and didn't care about his 50/50 chance on the operating table. The band in turn felt it was awfully selfish of Steve, to make everyone wait until HE decided to have surgery, while financially their lives fell apart. No one was willing to compromise, although Steve P. tried, by doing one video for the TBF CD. While filming the video, inbetween takes, Steve would hobble back to his trailer and be packed in ice up to his hip. Which was swollen from him standing on it, yet from watching the video you'd never know what overwhelming pain Steve was in during the making of that video. For everyone's sake Steve did try, but his body, time and circumstances were all saying no. When time rolled around for the band to take the Trial By Fire Tour on the road, Steve decided he would not rush into surgery. The band had already gotten together as a group, without Steve, and decided that if Steve told them ""no"" as to surgery, that they would vote him out of the band. It was painful for both parties, but time and circumstances, had already decided Journey's fate. In the end, the band carried on without Steve. The band felt he was wrong to not do the surgery to help save the members financially, by getting on the road sooner than advised after such a serious surgery. Steve felt his bandmates were being unreasonable and uncaring for his health and well being, by asking him to rush into an operation that could very well take his life. After the split, neither party looked back or ever spoke directly to each other again.

So Steve did not break up Journey.

Neal did not kick Steve out of Journey.

Time and circumstances separated a great band, period!

The band with the original lineup did get together, informerly, when they were finally honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for music. Steve Perry merely put together this DVD and the subsequent Greatest Hits DVD as an education into the making of Journey. If he had done this DVD just to show

off his amazing voice, then why, in this DVD does he take special care to see to it that the NEAL SCHON, JONATHAN CAIN & STEVE SMITH solos are well highlighted. As some other reveiwers have accused him of, if Steve had such a big head, he could have easily left those visual solo performances on the cutting room floor! But he didn't, Steve as producer of this DVD showcases all the band members performances, solo and together, with great care, quality and equal time!

This DVD showcases the band at their peak, at their best as brothers in music! It has always been about the music and still is! I would seriously advise new fans of Journey, starring Augeri, to buy the DVD's featuring Steve Perry. Otherwise you're really cheating yourself out of an education and insight

into the making of Journey and how they came to be.

As for Veterans that are still, after all these years, taking Neal's or Steve's side and using a review to spew out hate for one or the other bandmember. Stop the hate!

Journey was NEVER about dissension! They were about faith, hope, love, courage, perserverance and the will to get back up, dust yourself off and carry on. Furthermore your unkind venom only serves to rob new Journey fans, from seeking out an education and understanding of what it means to be part of a fanbase, of a band that has an amzing musical history such as JOURNEY does! You Veterans who have used this music review to be so unkind (and you know who you are) ought to be ashamed of yourselves!

In closing, to all, don't forget the good times. The past is always to be remembered, never forgotten. As long as you never forget, Journey will always live forever. I recently saw a live performance of Journey with Augeri, I was very pleased. As a

verteran I'm use to hearing Perry's astounding vocals. And you always think, nobody can bring that kinda flavor to Journey like Perry did. But you know what, Augeri works, he flows well with the ""new"" Journey lineup I saw. I got goosebumps, which is a strong indicator for me that this Journey is a WINNER.

To veterans still fighting about the riff, LET GO OF THE GRUDGE! The members have all moved on, its time you do the same. Even old dogs learn new tricks, so they don't get put to sleep, get my point? Get with the program! And stop adding

to the negative energy of this already damaged universe.

But it was never about this lead singer, or that lead singer, or who's better to head the band, will it be the same, etc, etc, etc. Initially it was, and always has been about

the almalgamation, of the forming of 5 men to come together, to create an amazing band called JOURNEY!

So new Journey fans (who only know of Augeri as lead singer and never heard of Steve Perry), don't be afraid, or let a negative review about this oldie but goodie material on this DVD turn you away. Don't be blind sided by someone else's negative words. You will surely miss out on a valuable musical educational history, if you pass up this DVD and the GREATEST HITS 1978-1997 DVD on JOURNEY!

Ladies and gentleman we still have JOURNEY, and in the end isn't that what matters most?(smiles)

2436353,5,B000BPK2NE,"I discovered Journey for the first time sitting in the back seat of a friends car way back in the early '80's as he blasted my ear-drums with ""Don't Stop Believin'"" . I then found out it was the same band that had had a hit with the ballad ""Open Arms"" and I wanted to find out more. By this time ""Frontiers"" had been released and I caught the film-clip to ""Seperate Ways"" (as cheesy as I now know it to be). I immediately bought both ""Frontiers' and ""Escape"" on record and the very first CD I ever bought was ""Frontiers"". I have been a fan for over twenty years and regret never being able to see the band live. I realise Steve Augeri is doing a great job with the band and I'm loving their new stuff but it would've been nice to see Steve Perry and the band at the peak of their popularity. This DVD shows just how good a live band ""Journey"" were and the wonders of modern technology gives us a sound that is beyond belief. The CD is an extra added bonus and the original band interviews a nice extra but put the DVD on your 40"" widescreen with the sound up LOUD and witness the band that represents the truest example of rock that America has ever produced.",1144281600,4,1159,4.155555555555556
2436354,5,B000BPK2NE,This is what you hope for when you buy a concert on DVD.  I saw Journey on this tour in Knoxville.  Outstanding live and the DVD is just what I saw back in the day!

2436355,5,B000BPK2NE,"What a great, FUN DVD of what was obviously a terrific live show. I was only 2 at the time, but with the great sound and visuals, you feel yourself being sucked to 1981 Houston.

With Journey at their commercial and musical peak, all 5 guys look they are having the time of their lives. Steve Smith's drumming is electrifying. His drum solos are a highlight. New guy Jonathan Cain, on his first tour as a member of Journey, looks thrilled to be there, and his songs were already becoming classics (""Open Arms"", ""Who's Crying Now""). Especially at the extended instrumental ending of ""Crying"", all 4 musicians tear the roof off the place.

Of course, in the middle of it all is the man, the voice, Mr. Steve Perry. Listening to and watching ""Open Arms"" as performed live was incredible. From the rousing opening number ""Escape"" to the encore ""Any Way You Want It"", this DVD is a treat from start to finish. From the vintage interviews, visuals, the sound mix, the concert on CD (GREAT to listen to in the car!) and a great band at the peak of its career, it's worth every penny.

On a side note, I certainly wish the band well in its current incarnation. BUT...

To me, Journey without Steve Perry is like Bewitched without Dick York, Christy (TV show) without Kellie Martin, or New Coke instead of Classic Coke.

Enough said!!!",1143244800,4,1326,4.554621848739496

2436357,5,B000BPK2NE,"Back in 1981 (before Escape), Journey was at the cusp of going from good to great.  Their fan base had grown immensely after Steve Perry joined.  Music critics had taken notice of something special, with this band from San Francisco.  And then ... Escape was launched.

Journey went from good to great overnight.  Magic.  Passion.  Emotion.  It was what music should be, what music could be, and Steve Perry lit the fuse, along with Neil and Cain.  Wow!  Could music be this much fun?

'Live in Houston 1981' was recorded right after Escape was born.  Could ya tell from the fans screaming at the concert?  Nope.  These people acted as though every Escape song played was something they had heard 1,000 times already, and they loved every minute of it!

Steve Perry demonstrates effortlessly a voice that no one could touch.  Hearing 'Don't Stop Believin' from Steve Perry seems like its his first time singing the song.

Magic. Passion. Emotion.

Everyone has a Journey song related to some memory.  This DVD lets you drift back to those days, and remember.  If only for a moment .... you are taken back to Houston in 1981.  You are taken back to a day when Escape was just released.

2436358,5,B000BPK2NE,"This is the quintessential Journey line-up, the one that brought all those hits in the late 70's and 80's. I remember seeing this particular concert on M-TV in 1982, that's when M-TV actually played rock videos, I'm sure the 40 something crowd remembers these days with fondness, I know I certainly do. The band was at their peak during this period of their career, the songs were so memorable and the performance was simply amazing. That's the one thing that in my opinion always separated Journey from the other bands in that genre, it was their extremely high musicianship, they simply were the best musicians in that arena and coupled with the fact that they wrote such great songs, they had all the bases covered. The sound on this DVD is amazing, it's been remixed and is in 5.1 so it actually sounds better today than it did when it was first aired. The DVD also comes with a CD of the entire concert so you can listen in your car or on your home stereo. I strongly recommend anyone who appreciates Journey to purchases this package, it will bring you back to a time before the kids, the bills and life being so complicated and Steve Perry's performance will remind you why he was the best singer on the planet back then.",1142640000,,1228,4.511210762331839

The lineup you see in this DVD is the lineup that most think of when you mention Journey. What is truly amazing is what they were able to do with footage 25 years old. The picture quality is phenom and the sound quality almost Studio good. Most people have no idea just how good Journey was live. This will prove it once and for all. While chided for being overly commercial....Journey still rocked in their live shows. This performance gives you the very real essence of Journey. I would highly recommend this collection to ANYONE! Yes, you will like this even if you were not a particularly big fan of Journey.

2436403,4,B000BPK2NE,"Although I remember the many wonderful songs of Journey from back in the day, I did not become a true fan until recently.  It was so much fun to see this incarnation of Journey just pound the stage from start to finish. So many people swear by Steve Perry, and from this dvd it is easier to understand their point of view.  His human pinball approach to commanding the stage was a sight to behold.  Never still a moment and never missed a beat. WOW! Neal Schon only proved then what we now accept as gospel, he is the guitar god.  A badly shorn Ross Valory was every bit as impressive as he remains today. Jon Cain was the breath of fresh air this band needed at that time and his presence is a powerful force in the band.  Steve Smith?  The man is a drumming animal.

From a technical stand point Steve Perry did a good job of showcasing his former band mates. (Although he introduced everyone on stage except Ross.  hmmm a sign of things to come?) The sound is better (according to SP) with the Dolby turned off.  I'll take him at his word, but haven't tried it.

The special feature interviews were somewhat interesting, but nothing new.

Overall it is a must for any Journey fan or fan of good 80's music.  It will definitely hold you over until the Generations tour dvd comes out at the end of the year.",1136851200,2,1308,4.293877551020408

I like the fact that you also get a CD so you can enjoy this in the car too.  Admittedly the CD and DVD are not 100% identical but they are close enough.  I like having the bonus live version of ""The Party's Over"" on the CD to enjoy in the car.",1136160000,2,491,4.170212765957447

At last I can put the tracks into my ipod without sitting in front of the TV just waching.  Hope the Eagles do the same to their Farewell Concert I.",1136160000,,443,4.1647058823529415
2436406,5,B000BPK2NE,"This is the valid lineup of Journey.  Steve Perry is at his finest.  The control of his voice is quite sensational.  I recently read an interview with him and and he mentioned that working on the post production of this DVD was very challenging from an emotional standpoint especially since the band has now went on without him.  It was also interesting to note Steve's view of his vocals from that period.  He was surprised of his voice during this concert and how he was able to hit certain notes, nuances without realizing it.

Steve has gone on to live his life as he sees it now.  The distance gives even more curiosity and examination into the Journey Band that he was a apart of.  Also, I listened to Trial By Fire recently, (Last Journey Album with Steve), and there are again some brilliant moments on that as well.

But as we say in Spanish 'Del arbol caido todo el mundo hace lena' or 'From Dead tree everybody makes wood'.  People, This concert is Journey at the peak with Perry singing as his best.  His intervention in Mother, Father was really increadible.  Valory's playing is very good, punch, making the right notes.  Neal playing as awesome as always, Smitty did an incredible solo, and Cain was fabulous on the piano.  We will love JRNY for ever.  Thanks Steve Perry, for producing this material.

Steve Perry did a EXCELLENT job of making sure that everyone had some time to shine on this dvd.

It shows why this was the BEST BAND of the 80's. The engery of LIne of Fire, DSP, LTS and the Power Ballands Faithfully, Open Arms. Takes us back to the day when things was simpler. The only thing I had to worry about was passing my senior year of high school.

The dvd quality is the best. Perry did a terrific job of using the best equipment and engineers to make this a treat to have.

My deepest thanks to Steve for this work of art.. Waiting ever so paiently for more dvds and cd from the very talented person.

Hoping that someday there will be a new release of Steve Perry music. So a new generation and the last can enjoy the magic of

2436409,5,B000BPK2NE,"I bought this DVD yesterday in New York City, at that Virgin Records store. I was looking around, so I bought the Def Leppard ""Rock of Ages"" DVD also. See, they had many DVDs of bands, like Rainbow, Van Halen, Black Sabbath, etc. Except, I didn't find a Kiss DVD......... Did they not release one? I mean comon..... it's Kiss.

So, I got home very late, and I watched this DVD. Lemme tell you this my fellow reviewers. This is a great DVD. Journey is a kickass live band. Jonathan Cain is great at the piano, When ""Don't Stop Believin'"" came on, he had the piano covered. It was quite enchanting. Steve Perry had it down. He danced alot. I don't mean to be insulting, but his dancing was pretty funny. Hey, atleast he had some moves. You can tell Journey is a great live band, since Steve's vocals were exactly like the studio albums. Steve Smith(drummer) and Ross Valory(Bass) also did a great job.

But, we forgot someone. We forgot Neal Schon. Starting at age 4, he really knows how to play guitar. All of his riffs were great. He played them with ease. In ""Anyway You Want It"" (On the Departure album, released in 1980 I believe) he played the guitar solo with his eyes closed. He uses a Les Paul guitar. I've tried one of those guitars, and believe me, there not that easily. I'm used to Fenders, so it feels different. This guy has it all good.

Neal Schon Was only 17 when he debuted with Santana's band in 1971. He was world famous. He proved that he could kick some butt. So, he broke away from Santana's band, and formed Journey. And now, Journey is one of the most famous bands of all time in the genre of rock.

Steve Perry would eventually break away from the band, because he didn't want to go to that ""pop"" direction. David Lee Roth left Van Halen for the same reason. So, they replaced him with Steve Auguari (I think that's how you spell his name). So, Journey eventually broke up. Neal Schon and Jonathan Cain went to join Bad English (a term relating to pool)with Jack Blades (Night Ranger) and John Waite (The Babys). They were the ""supergroup"". Jack Blades eventually went and joined ""Damn Yankees"" with Ted Nugent and others, and they were another supergroup. Bad English did fine with their self-titled debut, but broke up after their 2nd album.

So, Journey got back together, came out with ""Arrival"" in 2001, and is now out with their new CD, ""Generations"". They have a new style, but it's pretty good. They still have that awesome sound. Neal has a part in ""Self-Defense"" of ""Generations""

Basically, this DVD brings back the olds days with Journey, before they broke up, or when Steve Perry left. Good times, huh? (It was November 6th, 1981).

By the way, you get the CD along with the DVD. You get the CD to go in a stereo, and a DVD for a DVD player or a computer. Get this DVD/CD and have some fun with the old days of Journey.

This is Charles Passantino, Peace everyone, and have a happy holiday, no matter what you celebrate. There is always a reason to celebrate.",1134864000,7,2997,4.4363636363636365

Being a die-hard Journey fan for many years, I supported the band even in the latest years, with their new lead singer and fine stage show.  Now this show is finally released in November 2005, without acknoledgement from Journey's own website (they were all smiles to accept the star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame, however), it really confirms that this was Journey's true incarnation.  Steve Perry is simply irreplaceable, as this time capsule clearly shows.  Produced by Perry, these tracks were only previously available in audio-CD only as ""Journey's Greatest Hits Live.""  Now in Dolby 5.1 surround with laser sharp picture and sound quality, this is the one to have, or discover Journey for the first time.  Everything was so much better for the band then.  Perry's soulful and powerful vocals (left off MTV's ""25 Greatest Voices"" list in favor of Kurt Cobain; go figure), Jonathan Cain's melodic piano (wonderful solo), Nein Schon's guitar (real seriously great guitar solo, too), Ross Valory's bass (just the same as today).  You really have not heard a drum solo, or drumming throughout, until you've heard Steve ""Machine Gun"" Smith tear through his routine.  This two disc set is clearly the best that Journey ever offered.  The Journey is complete, as far as this reviewer is concerned.

For all you record execs reading this, please get off your arse and release the many other shows that have been locked up and haven't seen in years.

There's not alot of flash here and they play 8 songs from Escape, 3 from Departure, a few solo's, 2 from Evolution and a couple from Infinity (which has to be their best from the Rolie period and most creative and most towards the progressive side leaning towards their previous 3 albums before Perry).  With that said, the 5.1 sound is great and offers something that you couldn't get from the VHS tape or cd.  And, of course, watching it and hearing it is incredible.  It's interesting to note that on the inner sleeve the only albums that are mentioned from Journey are the Steve Perry colaborations, which excludes Dream after Dream from 1981.  It doesn't mention their very first 3 albums or anything from the current Augeri era.  But I guess the fued goes on and it will interesting to see where Perry goes from here.  He is on the new David Pack cd singing back-up, but it is hard to find him out there.  Oh yeah, the tribute to Journey cd was a nice touch with him singing one of Augeri's songs.  That's a twist.  If you loved Journey with Perry, then this is a must have.",1133222400,37,1457,4.395522388059701
2436415,5,B000BPK2NE,"Like another reviewer I was also lucky enough to be at this very show, I still have my original concert shirt and ticket stub!. You couldn't imagine how tough it was to make it through school on that Friday especially when you saw nothing but Escape tour shirts on everyone that went on Thursday night, it was all I could do to not stop everyone I saw and ask about the show, and of course everyone said it was fantastic!! (like thats a shock?!).....it just made the adreniline flow even faster, man that was a looong day. Once at the show and as you will see on the DVD, the band was as crisp and as potent as anything I've ever heard. Steve has done a superb job of capturing the night in perfect digital clarity and sound, if you are even just the slightest fan of Journey you will not be disapointed. The addition of the audio CD is nice especially since it has the ""party's over"" which kicked ass live as you'll hear, the interviews are exellent (they all look so young), the slide show is nice and the promo film is perfect just like I remember at the end of the show. What a great nite it was here in Houston, this was my very first Jouney show, I later saw them another 3 times on the Frontiers, and ROR tours, and Steve on the FTLOSM tour too, but as you've heard before, there nothing like your first time....and now everyone gets to feel just like myself, and 20,000 Houstonians did that night too!!....now my memories will be digitaly perfect, FOREVER!!....",1132790400,6,1469,4.364963503649635
2436416,5,B000BPK2NE,"This DVD+CD set of Journey live in Houston 1981 is simple the most unbelievable concert DVD ever!!!  This is the band as Journey was meant to be experienced in 5.1 Dolby Stereo Surround Sound.  What can I say about this group that has not already been said.  Steve Perry is the BEST vocal performer and there is NONE that compare to him, he is The Voice.  Neal is a total master of the guitar.  Smitty is the ""Machine Gun"" like no other.  Ross is great bass player.  Jon is the keyboard master.  The production on the DVD and CD is set top notch.  You will enjoy listening to this again and again of the greatest band ever.",1132617600,5,623,4.256410256410256
2436417,5,B000BPK2NE,"I can vouch for the incredible energy displayed in this concert - I was lucky enough to be at the Houston Summit that night!  It was one of the last shows of the Escape tour and no one really knew that it would be filmed for MTV (and we probably wouldn't have cared since MTV was just starting out).  I had the good fortune of seeing MANY great concert tours during the early 80's in the Summit, such as Survivor/REO Speedwagon and Billy Squier/Queen.  But without a doubt my fondest concert memory is of this show which had Loverboy as the opening act!  They just don't put together groups like this anymore unless they are on a ""nostalgia"" tour - an incredible night with two rock acts at the height of their abilities!  Now I can show other people at least part of what they missed!!!",1132617600,4,787,4.363013698630137
2436418,5,B000BPK2NE,"Awesome! Journey at their best - live!  What a wonderful year it has been for Journey fans! The Hollywood Walk of Fame with so many members attending including our beloved Steve Perry, ""Don't Stop Believing"" as a top 10 download, The new Journey Generations CD and tour, Steve Perry at the World Series and now to top it all off a wonderful DVD and CD to relive the Houston concert. Perfection! The video is crystal clear as Steve Perry's voice soars & Neal's guitar rocks! The solos of Jonathan, Neal, and Steve Smith are a tremendous reminder of the musical talents of this band. Ross's bass and wonderful voice are likewise a part of the musical tapestry that made and makes Journey the best band ever. The interviews are very nice and a special treat to Journey fans. I enjoy hearing about what inspires these talented guys and how they are able to create such classic songs which have proven to be timeless. Many Thanks to Steve Perry and all who worked so hard to produce this gem of a performance DVD and CD. Thanks too for making it a two disk set and not a combo disk. It is a tremendous gift to all Journey fans. Merry Christmas a little early!",1132617600,6,1154,4.443396226415095
2436429,5,B000BPK2NE,"The DVD has an extra Steve Smith drum solo & the song Dead Or Alive that wasn't shown during the original MTV broadcast. The original broadcast has Steve Perry saying ""we are recording an album movie for M television"" & the new DVD has been corrected to have him say ""MTV""",1132531200,5,272,4.352941176470588
2436430,5,B000BPK2NE,"This is by far one of the best concert videos out there. Just from watching the DVD you can feel the pumped and energetic crowd. This DVD particularly shows Steve Perry's close connection with the audience and has such emotion to each song. Journey fans you will not be dissapointed in this DVD, I would pay much more for a great concert like this one.",1132444800,3,352,4.430769230769231
2436431,5,B000BPK2NE,"Finally, Journey's 1981 concert that was originally aired on MTV has been released on dvd. With there being a dvd of the current lineup of Journey, it is good to see the release of a Journey concert dvd featuring the classic line up with Steve Perry, Neal Schon, Jonathan Cain, Ross Valory, and Steve Smith. The Escape Tour dvd captures Journey at the top of their game. Prior to Escape, Journey had been quite popular, but with the release of Escape their popularity soard to new hights. Much of the material on the Escape album is played, 7 of its 10 songs, as well as the hits from Infinity, Evolution, and Departure.

 The Sound quality of the dvd is very good. I also like the packaging, having a booklet instead of having a one page chapter sheet. I also enjoyed the extra's, such as the interviews, and I especially liked that, included was an audio cd of the concert with the bonus song ""The Party's Over.""

 Overall, Journey Live in Houston is a great value. Many thanks to Steve Perry for being involved with the release of the dvd. If you can only own one Journey dvd, this is the one too get.",1132272000,7,1104,4.4236453201970445
2436432,5,B000BPK2NE,This is simply the best Journey concert DVD ever. I'm echoing alot of what has already been said but it's all true! A good concert even if you aren't a Journey fan.

2436433,5,B000BPK2NE,"...to a time when Journey ruled the concert stages and radios of America. I've been a fan since 1980, but didn't get to see them live until 1998, so this is a great addition to my Journey collection. I would have liked to see a longer set, but it could be short due to MTV time constaints at that time. The sound and picture quality is excellent and I like the fact that the CD and DVD are on separate discs (not a fan of dualdisc). My concern is that this takes away what the current/active Journey is doing- the 30th anniversary tour continues until December and the current lineup (the longest in Journey history) has released 3 CD's (Arrival, Red-13, and most recently, Generations)+ the Journey 2001 DVD not mentioned on the catalog list. Yes, Steve Perry was awesome, but current front-man Steve Augeri has allowed the Journey to continue. Buy this DVD and give the current Journey a chance too.",1132185600,6,901,4.567901234567901
2436434,5,B000BPK2NE,Here it is.  The Journey Houston 1981 DVD from the MTV coverage of the Escape Tour.  It is the long awaited holy grail of Journey concerts on DVD.  And it has been enhanced with a new stereo mix and 5.1 channel sound by Steve Perry and Allen Sides.  Not only did we receive a great new DVD from these masters but we also get a great CD for the car.  It is awesome.  It is the concert DVD and CD that I have been counting down the days to on the Journey Back Talk Forums [...] since the beginning of the month.  It is awesome.  If you are a Journey fan you will not be disappointed.  If you are not a big Journey fan we might convert you with this DVD. ~ JourneyRocks/ThisMusicRocks - Ken ~,1132185600,3,689,4.007352941176471

2436437,5,B000BPK2NE,"I too had this on video and wore the tape out!  This is by far the best example of how great Journey was!  I went to the Dallas concert which was 2 days after this particular concert and it was great as well!  All of you are right, Journey is not journey without the great Steve Perry!  I think he might have kicked up a stir when he appeared at the Chicago White Sox World series game!  Hopefully, he will make up with his former bandmates and do a ""real"" reunion tour.",1132012800,5,470,4.065217391304348
2436438,5,B000BPK2NE,"It would appear by some of the comments in the Amazon Editorial review that Mr. Hilgendorf was never a real fan of Journey. So why have him review this release? It's like having someone who does not like Italian food do an Italian restraunt review...it's of use to noone.

People who never liked Journey are not likely to be looking to buy this DVD and they don't need Mr. Hilgendorf to tell them that. On the other hand those of us who are real fans of Journey don't care that the stage didn't have enough gizmos on it. Journey was never about having band members flying about suspended from wires or fog machines and wierd elaborate stage productions (although later, they did pioneer the use of large video screens).

No, what people came to see and hear in those days was Steve Perry at the limits of his incredible voice performing ""Mother Father"" or Niel's fingers flying in a blur over the strings of his Stratocaster at the end of ""Line of Fire"" it was about the MUSIC!

With this DVD you'll get all that and more. Mr Hilgendorf seemingly laments the fact that this was an optimistic time for the band and that all the controversy that befel the band later in it's life escapes mention on this DVD. Well, if that's what your after, go watch the VH1 BTM special that aired last year.

Yes, this was about the MUSIC and a time when the magic that was Journey was at it's peak (no disrespect to the current line-up) and this DVD delivers that magic IN SPADES!!! If your a fan of Journey and Steve Perry this is your holy grail...don't pass it up.",1132012800,9,1551,4.4125874125874125

For me, it was still worth the price and fun to watch.  I just wish it was mastered and upscaled professionally to today's quality.
