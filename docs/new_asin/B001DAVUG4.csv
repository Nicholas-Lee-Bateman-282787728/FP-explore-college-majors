8292508,4,B001DAVUG4,"This is a movie that I watched a few days ago, and I am still thinking about it....which says volumes! Out of overwhelming grief, a young woman finds her life purpose. She, as well as her twin sister and her husband, leave their lucrative careers, to make a difference in the world. Her grief did not go away magically, but the healing occurs slowly over time, as she realizes her purpose is to give hope to impoverished women on another continent. Truly, a moving and unforgettable film.",1371859200,,488,4.620689655172414
8292509,5,B001DAVUG4,"Well done, a personal search for a way to continue to live without the one you love, not just exist, but by working toward something that has relevance. The quiet beauty of the support provided by family during an extended period of grief is also clearly and honestly shown. In today's world of disillusionment, it was very moving to see one family face uncertainty and yet with gentleness and day-by-day determination, find a way to make so much sense out of a senseless death.",1301616000,,478,4.7023809523809526
8292510,4,B001DAVUG4,"Tamara made a fair trade of life for death.  I suppose it wouldn't really be a spoiler to tell you that the movie concerns a young woman who works with Robert Zemeckis in Hollywood until her life turns upside down when an elderly woman kills her bearded boyfriend, Matt.  In an instant Tamara goes from being full of life and full of fun to a state of catatonic depression.  She sees no point in living any longer now that her precious Matt has left this world, the victim of an elderly driver who slammed into him as he was parking.  This tragedy haunts the movie, though for some reason we the audience never get to know Matt well.  I wonder why there was so little film coverage of him, though a lot of different photos show him experimenting with different hair and beard stylings.

We do get to hear one song Matt wrote though, part of an eclectic soundtrack that deserves its own release.  The song--well, it's ok, and it must have meant a lot to Tamara.  She tries to go back to work, but instead just sits there and when the pain gets too much, she resorts to deadening her feelings with alcohol, cigarettes, and cutting herself.  Co-workers notice and before long she is living alone in the apartment she once shared with Matt, death tempting her.

Luckily the Fair Trade movement was underway and her twin sister, sensible Shelby, and the sister's husband, brainiac Steven, talk her into helping them import shea butter from Togo, and eventually she goes to Togo and talks to native women.  I was reminded of the documentary CRAZY SEXY CANCER, another one my wife made me watch.  If you have seen both films than you will be astonished at the amazing similarity the two docs share, especially at the ending of each, for they have the exact same romantic denouement.

Some aspects of the doc confused me.  Apparently Tamara and Shelby are super close, but what about the rest of their family?  Never seen!  Film-maker Lauralee Farrer, who narrates the show, makes some cryptic comments about meeting the twins when they moved in next door to her, a pair of troubled thirteen year olds.  One feels like there are vast areas of Tamara's life that are left in shadowm perhaps for good reason?
A side benefit of watching this movie is that we started our own fair trade company.",1255996800,,2283,4.583743842364532
8292511,5,B001DAVUG4,This movie demands the viewers to absolutely re-evaluate their lives.  'What is it worth?' What keeps us going?  What are we doing?  So many questions that stir the soul.  Tamara is truly inspirational; a brave lady who shares with the world her story.  This is a movie I want to share with many a people; to open their eyes and help them see an example of a real person who actually HAS to live an honest and true life.,1226793600,3,420,4.265822784810126
8292512,5,B001DAVUG4,"This movie touch me so much and gives one the encouragement that even in the midst of the darkest times of our lives we not only have hope for ourselves, but we have the ability to bring hope to others and actually do something worth while in life.  Very deep with charming parts to lighten the load.",1226188800,,300,4.2631578947368425
8292513,5,B001DAVUG4,"Brave Tamara extends to us the priviledge of sharing in her journey through catastrophic grief to the ultimate triumph of recovery as she discovers a life that is not only well worth living, but a life filled with surprises and profound purpose.  The Fair Trade is not only a film for those interested in fair trade products, but it is a film for anyone who has suffered loss or longed for a life of meaning.  I cannot recommend this film highly enough.  It is beautifully crafted in every way and you will never be the same for having watched it.",1224547200,,547,4.45
8292514,5,B001DAVUG4,"This movie is one of those rare things that come around in life that truly makes you change your perspective, and I believe makes you a better person in the process.  I cannot say enough how much I appreciated the openness of Tamara in sharing her life experience.  This movie is not only enjoyable but it serves the ultimate purpose of art which is to make the world a better place by example.",1224460800,4,394,4.383561643835616
8292515,5,B001DAVUG4,"This is a story of courage and hope. Anyone who has ever lost a loved one will identify with Tamara's struggle with depression, and search for purpose and meaning after the loss of her fiance, Matt.  Her persistence to push through the darkness towards hope is inspiring.  It is one of the most moving films I've ever seen. It will challenge you to look at your own life, once you realize that one person really CAN make a difference in this world.",1224460800,4,448,4.451219512195122
