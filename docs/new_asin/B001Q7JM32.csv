3762815,5,B001Q7JM32,"An extremely well done documentary that relates the World's 3 great religions, Judaism, Christianity and Islam to Jerusalem.  Numerous key figures in the history of these religions and Jerusalem's history are examined in sufficient detail to provide a rich understanding of the people, places and beliefs covered.

3762833,5,B001Q7JM32,"The best part of this documentary is how well-balanced it is.  You get to see artistic renderings of Jerusalem from the many centuries, and current cinematography, and the documentary also gives a deep understanding of why it has such a mystical aura to many religious people.  I learned much about why Muslims have strong interest in the city.  Whoever researched and selected information from such a variety of sources did a good job, incorporating into the narration quotations from various written accounts and focusing in on specific places and theological traditions.  If I were teaching a class of students, I would eagerly show them this documentary.  Even though the stuff after the Crusades gets far less time on the documentary than any previous era, it didn't feel incomplete to me except regarding the 20th century conflicts, which I'm sure would be quite complicated for a documentary of this predetermined 2-hour length to include.  It's got an excellent presentation of the sites that are holiest to different faiths, and explains the Jews' expulsion and readmittance to live in the city, something I would have had some trouble finding elsewhere.  They were kicked out by the Romans after the 70 AD conquest of the city and were treated the same by the ""Christian"" crusaders (who were completely violating the teachings of Christ), and it was the Muslims who treated them better.  Ray Suarez is an excellent host for the documentary, too.

If I went to Jerusalem, I would find it a strange experience, knowing that so much blood had been shed over what was the true religion.  My own faith depends on teachings of Jesus rather than a specific destiny of the city of Jerusalem, but it's sure a strange phenomenon that a city which inspires so many people can be in such constant tension among religious and political groups.  It's a place of peace and festering tension at the same time.  Since European maps put Jerusalem at the center of the 3 continents they knew, which were Europe, Asia, and Africa, I think it's likely that the western and eastern hemispheres were established after the discovery of the New World with the map still being given that same orientation toward the ""holy land"".  If you look at a current map of the world, Jerusalem is still in the center, because of where they chose to cut off the ocean on the western and eastern edges of the map.",1438128000,7,2384,4.828009828009828

3762840,2,B001Q7JM32,This PBS Home video was a bit of a disappointment!  More like a Sunday school narrative about the early Jewish and Christian history.  I believe anyone who went to Sunday school up to 7th grade had an equal knowledge of what this video put out.  The narrative and people giving it were quite boring!  The only good part of this video was the part on Islam.  I did get some new insights on the history of Islam and the history of Jerusalem and Islam.  Besides that the history given in this video is on a pre high school level.  I would rate this video a dud!,1429228800,,558,4.2075471698113205

finding it recently.  It's narrated by Jewish, Christian and Moslem academics
each presenting the perspective of Jerusalem's importance to their faith.
I was moved at seeing some scenes I wasn't able to see when I was there
before--particularly the main church in Bethlehem (OK, that's not Jerusalem--still
it was interesting) and the interior of the main mosque on the mount---stunningly
beautiful.  Worth watching.",1403395200,2,498,5.358974358974359

3762856,4,B001Q7JM32,"This 2-hour documentary on the archaeological roots of Jerusalem covers its history as a Jewish, Christian, and Muslim religious center. Like most PBS documentaries, it is richly produced and beautifully filmed, being flawed only insofar that it is tremendously boring. Ray Suarez (""The News Hour"") is a good host as he addresses the camera during the film's journey through the city, including some lovely camerawork. The scholars are on-target and insightful.

But boy oh boy, is this video dull! It's like PBS dopes its programs with a special chemical that induces sleep. I love this material, but PBS turns it all into a monotonous drone, and I'm afraid public television still hasn't learned the tricks of digital special effects and cinematic editing employed by National Geographic and History Channel. The style here is a classic documentary approach, interlacing thoughtful interviews with static photography and location footage, without any stylistic flair at all. The problem is that this film is a 2009 documentary using 1979's videography techniques. I strongly recommend this video for its content, but not for its style, and I would caution anyone against using it with young students accustomed to modern visuals. Older adults and people with a special research interest in the topic will enjoy it, but younger people will either zone out or bang their heads against a wall.",1399075200,8,1392,5.242152466367713

3762864,4,B001Q7JM32,"The author or producer of this DVD about Jerusalem did a splendid job. It is indeed fascinating as well as educational. It also appears to many of us as a significant work because we think it is very related to Biblical history as told in the Old and the New Testaments. The conquest of this city by the empires of Egypt,Assyria,Babylon, Persia and Rome are described. It has become the center of Christianity,Judaism and Mohammedanism. As Christians we find this DVD about Jerusalem as extremely interesting and worth learning or re-learning. The birthplace of Jesus in Bethlehem not far from Jerusalem is described as well as his life and death as written in the Gospels of Luke,Matthew, Mark and John in the New Testament. How the city fared in ancient times, and the Diaspora, the Jewish resistance of the Jews against the Romans,etc, is vividly told. Today the problems it faces and how it manages to solve them if possible are mentioned and well worth understanding.
  4 stars instead of 5 is probably because we hoped that it included more of its history. But at any rate we think the DVD is very good and really worth purchasing, owning and learning more about Jerusalem,the Center of the World.",1381795200,2,1203,4.778846153846154

3762866,5,B001Q7JM32,"For a young couple who enjoys History Channel and Discovery Channel documentaries, this was a great addition to our collection.

While it may not be deep enough for scholars and true historians, it was an entertaining way for a busy couple to learn more about another culture without enrolling in a class.  The intersection between these three religions is really interesting, and this is a good introductory lesson into how closely tied we are with people we consider to be ""different"" from us.  This won't add anything to someone who already closely studies religious history, but it gives a good overview for someone looking for educational at-home entertainment.",1371254400,2,666,5.148148148148148

3762871,5,B001Q7JM32,"This panorama documentary was outstanding; saw it last night.  The interviews with historians, clerics, Christians, Jews and Muslims were wonderful.  A little long but in one evening it was like going back there.  And, once you've been to Jerusalem, you will always want to go back.  This work explains why this city is considered to this day the Center of the World, as it appeared on many early maps so noted.

I thought this work fair to all three World Religions and fair to Christians, which was refreshing.  Those Christians depicted--Orthodox, Catholic, and some Protestant--each got pretty much equal play.  And I found that the project, funded by various charitable foundations and individuals, wasn't preachy.  It seemed to have no axe to grind.  The message was simple: for thousands of years this city has been at the forefront of human history.  Politics, religion, peace, war; it's all there.

I once asked my mom the year before she died if she missed the opportunity to travel.  ""Why?  I can sit here in front of my TV and go anywhere.""  The pilgrims of old might have agreed with her...and skipped the price tag of risk and danger and expense of such a pilgrimage, had they access to this DVD.

From Abraham, to Jesus, the Crusades, to recent wars...the story is all here but not laboriously so.  Well done.  My favorite part is where a Muslim family a couple hundred years ago I think was entrusted with the keys of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.  Muslims have the key to the most holy site of all Christendom.  Gotta love that.  Why?  To keep the followers of Jesus from killing each other over which part of the church and which day or hour is to be shared by whom.  Awful but nice. Sort of.

When we were in Jerusalem in May of 2010, bullets and guns were everywhere.  Some shots were fired. Not a few were killed in the weeks before and after our twelve day stay.  Some pilgrims were kidnapped, too.  Very common events through the centuries as this film explains.  After seeing this video, I have a greater understanding and context for why.  Jerusalem is the only city I know of that has a disease named after it: Jerusalem Disease: a certain kind of madness.  Passions run wild in this town, drive people crazy in this city.  For centuries.

I came here last year with a monk who said he made the journey to get to know Jesus better.  Whatever your reason, if you simply love history or the human story, make a pilgrimage to this Holy Place--regardless of your faith practice.  Failing that, see this documentary.  You'll get chills at the end.  I did.",1339804800,,2580,4.607929515418502

A great collection of pictures to be watched more than once.  The second DVD ""Walking the Bible"" unfortunately did not come close.  Primarily because of the quality of the DVD.  The journey is well done and the pictures would be fantastic - except - that my DVD was of poor quality.  I got a lot of ""snow"" on the left side of the screen which made it difficult to look at. I had hoped that its quality would improve through the different sections, but unfortunately it did not happen.  I purchased these DVDs together and had to wait a few weeks before being able to watch them.  By the time I did, I felt perhaps it was too late to send the one back ..

If you already have a basic understanding of Jerusalem's history, there won't be much new for you here.
Ray Suarez's enthusiastic and measured presentation prevents this from being completely didactic, which it tends to be.

It covered the entire history of the city and its significant sites. I would highly recommend this one. I purchased this as a pre-trip source of information and it gave me great background knowledge. It was totally worth the time to watch. Buy this one and skip all the others...,1275091200,71,431,4.538461538461538
3762886,5,B001Q7JM32,"This DVD provides extensive coverage of the history of Jerusalem, including the relationship of the city with Jews, Christians, and Muslims. It seems appropriate for those of any faith. There is a wide range of material included and it has been thoughtfully put together.

The material is more informational than you would find in a travel video. I'll have to say that there is so much included that I will have to watch it more than once to absorb even a fraction of what is there. I found that it required more focus than I was able to give it as I watched the first time, because I was tired. This one needs more attention than just a casual viewing, in my opinion.",1269734400,47,668,4.430894308943089
8335100,4,B001Q7JM32,"This shares the history of the city from its earliest possible noted time on through to King David making it the capital and King Solomon building the temple. Then other countries invade and the location is degraded. Eventually it is rebuilt and renewed. Jesus spends time there and then the Romans reek destruction in the area driving out Hebrews, just in time for Christians to lay claim to the location.

Eventually it is determined that The Prophet of Islam wants to lay some claim as he said he visited there so eventually believers aspire to make it part of their kingdoms.

Crusaders are dispatched and dispense absolute violence which is eventually turned out with not nearly as much violence. Eventually the area becomes a back water area until much later and once again interest in renewed.

Told with interviews and artwork this is an interesting telling of the location with many sites visited by the host showing the modern day results.",1524873600,,949,4.881987577639752
