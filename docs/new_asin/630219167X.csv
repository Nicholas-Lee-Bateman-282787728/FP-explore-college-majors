7822193,5,630219167X,"""The Insect Woman"" is a classic film from Shohei Inamura, one of Japan's greatest directors--which begs the question, where is the dvd that should be so readily available?

This is a stark, black and white movie which opens with close-ups of a weevil negotiating its way up a hill of dirt.  The musical accompaniment is macabre.  These shots of the isolated and alien world of the insect pave the way for a harrowing, unsettling look at human perversity and lives mired in frustration.

Tome (Sachiko Hidari) is born out of an uncertain relationship.  Her father (""Chuji"") is prouder of her as an acquisition than as a daughter, since his wife has been unfaithful and he is doubtful of his paternity.  All women are the same to Chuji, and he comes to expect the same servicing from her as he does from other women.  Like insects, at birth the behaviors are predetermined.  Chuji even suckles at his daughter's breast, and she is not repulsed.

As a female member of the impoverished rural class, when she leaves home, Tome can advance herself only through menial labor, or by attaching herself to a wealthy male patron.  She becomes a kind of geisha, working for a hard-hearted madam, and she learns the ropes well enough to become a madam herself.  She longs for her daughter to escape the cyclical nature of oppressed poverty (because ""Grandpa Chuji"" is also treating the granddaughter as he did his daughter), but Tome knows that ""between men and women nothing changes"" and a trap has been prepared for all women.  She watches helplessly as the rich businessman who favored her now turns his attentions to her daughter.

""The sins of the father are to be laid on the children"", Shakespeare wrote, and that is the theme of this movie.  Inamura was obsessed with showing the underside of Japanese society, and he didn't believe that his films would translate well into the world at large.  But these themes are universal.  Inamura is a master storyteller, and this film moves easily, with many memorable sequences (especially one in which a young child that Tome is babysitting is badly burned, resulting in a guilt that Tome bears for the rest of her life).  At times, Inamura halts the film with freeze frames, to emphasize that life is made up of moments, and to highlight the emotions playing on the characters' faces.

This is really an important and remarkable film, focusing as it does on the hardships borne by Japanese women as portrayed in the decades of one woman's life.

There really isn't any other film like it.  I give it five stars.",1382659200,,2550,4.752272727272727
7822194,3,630219167X,"Sachiko Hidari gave one of the most overwhelming performances of that decade about the in and outs of an impoverished country girl who flees Tokio to become a successful madam.

Once more, Shohei Imamura directed this emotive and harrowing drama around the hard times the Japanese women had to face since the second decade of the century until the sixties. Over the years Imamura would build an ambitious and successful career with Japanese films that certainly would surpass its own boundaries (The Ballad of Narajama - his masterpiece and possibly the most shocking film of the eighties, true winner of Cannes Festival  The eel, Black rain and Eijanaika) and turned the whole attention of the world about him spite of the fact the presence of the master of masters Akira Kurosawa was giving the world films like Dodes Kaden, Dersu Uzala , Kagemusha, Ran or Dreams for instance that literally dazzled the world due its overwhelming and intense emotional burden and spiritual intensity.

One can note the undeniable influence of two giants of the Japanese cinema who exerted on this promising director by then: Kenji Mizoguchi and Yasujiro Ozu. The first of both in which concerns the thematic of the play and Ozu due its horizontal and fixed camera angles hovered of incisive realism and visible theatrical feature.

A must-have and a must see for all these hard fan lovers of the cinema.",1260748800,,1389,4.948497854077253
7822195,2,630219167X,"There wasn't a whole lot I liked about this film and yet I can still recognize it as an honorable failure. ""300"". . .that, on the other hand, was a shameless failure. This movie wasn't in it for box office glory, but rather it exists to show the dark side of a woman who lived in the very patriarchal Japan in the first half of the last century. Tome (Sachiko Hidari) is a girl who is born into a profoundly sad situation. Her father has eyes for her pretty much since birth (maybe she reminds him of her mother) and quickly thereafter an incestuous relationship is born. The first half of the film sticks closely to the ""More pain! More suffering!"" formula. We watch as Tome is taught some tough lessons in Man Hating 101, and in the future when I hear girls complain about having daddy issues I'm going to think of Tome. Throughout her life her father uses her as one of two things: a punching bag and an inflate-a-mate. As she grows up and gets older the sexual aspect of their relationship is not abandoned. He becomes jealous and possessive when she threatens to leave and even fakes sickness in order to lure her back into his snake pit. The other men in her life are no more romantic. One uses her for career purposes and then leaves her in his dust. All of this leads up to her becoming a prostitute which is to be expected, I guess, given the circumstances. The problem, from the viewer's standpoint, is that once the pain and suffering stops the boredom sets in. The second half of the film dares you fall into a deep sleep as the story engine, which was less than healthy to begin with, putters to a standstill.

The film is filled with sex, but it is never any fun to watch. Shohei Imamura, the director, uses jarring techniques to destroy any mood you may be working up towards. There are freeze frames and extreme close-ups and all the while everything is shrouded in darkness. Also, most of the second half takes place in a brothel, but when I'm hanging out with a bunch of prostitutes the last thing I want to be thinking about is business and politics. Yet here Imamura is here, focusing in and just those things. The obvious point here is that men are evil, and I'm OK with that, if I were Tome I would feel the same way. It is men who exploit her for sex and then it is men who pass religious judgments on her for having ""carnal desires."" Her transformation from prey to predator is not one she accidentally stumbles into but one that she was forced into by the corrupt world around her. Time passes quickly and decades pile up. Her father makes the smooth transition from dirty man to dirty old man. Tom has a kid who also has nothing to look forward to in life. One thing I truly appreciate about this film, and it is this way with lots of older foreign films, is their ability to not give into their ADD. They hold shots longer than 3 seconds and it is a beautiful thing to watch. The film is filled with stunning, contemplative shots that do not get interrupted out of fear that the kids might get bored (ever wonder why it is that they get bored so easily?). But still I got bored. I couldn't keep up with the twisted family tree and the lessons they were trying to hawk (everything comes full circle) were somewhat obvious. An honorable failure indeed, but not one you should rush out and see. **1/4",1174608000,,3324,4.361290322580645
