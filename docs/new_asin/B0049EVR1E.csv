4288221,3,B0049EVR1E,"Well, the actress that played Maeve supposedly had some attitude and personal problems that clashed with the production.  That's too bad, because she was a fun character, and I was sorry to see her go.

But, the other reason this show was just okay was because it was just that.  An okay show.  It was aimed at pre-teen boys, but apparently preteens to 20-somethings of both sexes liked it.

The other thing that held it back (and probably helped torpedo the thing) was introducing ""space aliens"" about half way through the second season.  The original show was about Sinbad gallivanting around in medieval Arabia, and sailing to distant shores.  There was magic, there was adventure, there were sword fights, there were some dangerous monsters of all kinds.  But, the psychological gist of the show for the viewers is that you can't stay wedded to adventure stories for children young and old alike, and that magic has to be pushed out in favor of science and understanding.  Ergo we get the aliens in season two.

That kind of message is not bad in and of itself, but this is a children's show, and as much as you want your child to grow up and realize that stories about wizards and dragons are ultimately fiction, do you really need to put that into a TV adventure show?  I liked the TV show for its simple adventure stories, but to inject this high minded psychological manipulation?  It's just condescending.

And, for the record, the space alien episode was one of the hokiest ever.  In fact it was down right stupid, even for a series aimed at the young at heart.  And, if that was the direction the show was ultimately headed for a Third Season, then I'm glad it was cancelled.

Otherwise it's entertaining for what it is.  Don't expect a whole lot of deep stories nor great acting.  A lot of the money went into the sets and CGI, and the direction its given is pretty basic.",1421280000,,1884,4.573134328358209

4288227,5,B0049EVR1E,"The Adventures of Sinbad, Complete Second Season was a television series and is among my favorites.  Sinbad and his crew take voyage to many diverse places, encounter giants, villains, wizards; guarding creatures and the mystical and the magical. There are people of cultural and ethnic diversity presented in this series, so don't let the jacket cover mislead you. The land and seascapes in this film series are simply beautiful and good editing. Lots of adventure and enough variety for the whole family!  A good add to the Sinbad collector's library.",1376352000,2,553,5.133333333333334

8419020,5,B0049EVR1E,"Have not watched this yet but I plan to soon.  I bought it because when they came out in the mid 1990's some 20 years ago now I loved the show and tried never to miss an episode.  I love these types of TV shows based on Greek myths and legends.  This show garnered popularity and a cult following due to hugely successful Hercules and Xena TV series at the time, along w/ other shows like Beastmaster and Roar, which btw I also have ""Roar"" the complete series too.  Anyway, Amazon had the second season super cheap so I bought to add to my collection.  I also bought season one of this series as well from Amazon.  Sure the special FX are somewhat cheesy compared to the shows we see today (i.e. Flash, Arrow, Agents of Shield, etc ) but hey so were Hercules and Xena!  Lol!  And look how popular they were! The Adventures of Sinbad was not half bad for a Canadian produced TV series shown in the US.  Zen Gesner portrayed a good Sinbad and I liked the close comradery of the entire cast too.  Alliance gave us several great TV shows many I wish had not ended early before their time.  Oh yea one last thing -- I hated the departure of Maeve at the end of Season 1, and I wished she had stayed on.  I believe some sort of financial or other dispute w/ the shows producers kept her from renewing her contract for season 2.  But Brynn filling in as the lead female costar wasn't half bad (and not bad eye candy either!) and the show was still enjoyable to watch overall.  Sure I was somewhat disappointed they ended it w/ season two but it was apparent the ratings had gone down since the start of the first season...  Anyway, I do highly recommend getting this TV series if you were a fan or enjoyed watching it even remotely.  It's too cheap to pass up!  Thanks Amazon and Alliance Canada for releasing this on DVD!",1493424000,,1815,4.260233918128655
8419021,5,B0049EVR1E,Season One and Two were released in Canada and not the US. I liked the series. So I purchased both seasons from Amazon Marketplace. They play fine.,1493164800,,147,4.481481481481482
