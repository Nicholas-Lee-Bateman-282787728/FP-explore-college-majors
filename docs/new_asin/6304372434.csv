7868936,2,6304372434,"A pretty weak tape. WHOOPS, I'M AN INDIAN is too boring for my likes. The short goes into too many different plots. The only highlight for me is the scene where the canoe appears to be jet propelled. ROCKIN' THRU THE ROCKIES was actually pretty good. The scene with the bear was funny, and so was the fishing scene. A funny short. CACTUS MAKES PERFECT was just too slowly paced for my likes. The scene where Moe is stuck goes on too long.
Notice that all three of these shorts take place in the forest, where the Stooges meet indians.",1011312000,,534,4.35
7868937,4,6304372434,"WHOOPS, I'M AN INDIAN! (1936) - A great short, with the Stooges as outlaws in a Western town, disguising as Indians to fool the sheriff. The first half is pretty good, especially Curly's fishing scenes, and the second half is ever better, when Curly dresses up as a squaw, and Pierre, a French trooper, falls in love with Curly. Bud Jamison is hilarious as Pierre, and I love the way he does the accent.
ROCKIN' THRU THE ROCKIES (1940) - The Stooges are leaders of ""Nelle's Belles"", a traveling entertaining female group, and get stranded in a cold, snowy old place. They are threatened by Indians to leave in 24 hours, or they'll get scapled. A pretty good short. Curly scaring the bear by barking is the best part.
CACTUS MAKES PERFECT (1942) - Curly's gold finder is proven successful by the Inventors Association, and the boys decide to go out west to search for gold with it. A hilarious short with a lot of great scenes. Best scenes include the scene with the mother (played by writer Monty Collins...yes, a guy!) trying to wake the Stooges up, the Stooges shaving, Moe and Larry's attempts to get Curly's head unstuck from a hole, and the hilarious ending.
Interestingly, a common theme is shared amongst these shorts, with the boys out in the woods and wilderness, and encountering Indians (a bit un-PC today, but who cares?).",994550400,2,1334,4.680851063829787
7868938,5,6304372434,"This tape has three of their better shorts. In particular,i like how BUD  JAIMSON got alot of screen time in this one. If your like me,you'll know  that bud jaimson is one of the best stooge supporting players along with  VERNON DENT.Also,if your a true stooge fanatic like i am you'll know who  these fine actors were.",969062400,,319,4.543859649122807
