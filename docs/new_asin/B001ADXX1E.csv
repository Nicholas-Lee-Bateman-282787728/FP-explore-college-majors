3447180,5,B001ADXX1E,"This contains the best acting I have seen in an Irish film in many years. It is a reworking of a play, and the adaptation preserves all the intensity and intimacy which is usual within a theatre production. It is a dark, brooding and menacing work which does not belong in the category of light entertainment, but rather, a higher art. If you are prepared to go on the journey, you will find it has rewards. But be warned that there is no compromise here to easy access for English only speakers - it is predominantly in Irish with English subtitles. If you like the theatre, you should find this a real treat. Forget Hollywood, or indeed Fair City, this contains the best ensemble acting by an Irish cast since the best of the Roddy Doyle films.",1221782400,38,746,4.452554744525547

3447195,5,B001ADXX1E,"I bought this because it was in Irish. I thought it was very cleverly done; the main spoken language is Irish but they're in England, and the viewer understanding was supported by visuals such as newspaper headlines, signs etc. as well as the English people speaking English. Great blend of both languages. A kind of depressing story line on the surface, but very realistic and powerful, and very, very well done. Thoroughly enjoyed this. A great work.",1346976000,4,452,4.883116883116883
3447196,5,B001ADXX1E,"From its opening seconds, this film is remarkable, though wrenching and difficult.  It is a pleasure to hear the Irish spoken, and Rosin Elsafty's singing is a gorgeous touch.  It is ""must"" viewing for anyone interested in the lives and dreams of emigrants.",1299715200,5,257,4.953488372093023

3447198,5,B001ADXX1E,"I knew nothing about this film -- found it online -- and it is quite remarkable. Based on a stage play, with I gather, all the original cast (except Colm Meany?), it has been translated to film with intelligence and deep feeling. It was my first time to watch a film that is almost entirely in Irish (with English subtitles), and the story is both wrenching and touching. It does, as one of the actors says in the special feature section, which should most definitely be watched, speak to the issue of emmigrants/immigrants from any country. Beautifully done.",1285200000,5,559,4.714285714285714
3447199,5,B001ADXX1E,"I love the Irish language.  I only have a working vocabulary of about 30 words but I love every one of them! And I love to listen to spoken Irish.

Don't get much opportunity in the USA, do I?

Frankly, I only bought this movie because it's in Irish and for that reason alone I'm glad I did.  But it is really a VERY fine film!  The acting is extraordinary, there's no one in it who isn't excellent beyond any reasonable expectation -- they're AMAZING!  And -- I don't know what the writer and director and producers intended -- but to me, it is a compassionate and yet completely unrelenting presentation of the price a people group will pay for accepting a culture of alcohol addiction.

The story takes place in the present day, showing the current lives of five men of Connemara who emigrated to London as youngsters, for work.  All of their lives have been influenced by addiction in one way or another, to greater and lesser degrees of devastation.  The film isn't without hope, nor without the possibility of restoration, but it doesn't pull any punches either.

I like it very very much and I'm glad I invested.  BTW: The Irish is GREAT!!",1270598400,17,1146,4.514563106796117
3447200,5,B001ADXX1E,"This a movie not to be missed.  Powerful...pure and simple.  Brings us on a journey thru the eyes of men who wanted it all when they were younger and then shows us what they have years later...or lack of what they have years later.  It is in the Irish language so you need to watch subtitles but that only adds to the atmosphere of the movie.

Again powerful!!",1233014400,24,360,4.25

8277110,1,B001ADXX1E,"Please note that most of the 5-star reviews mention 'it was in Irish' - so how much of a plot/dialogue would be required for them to like it since 'it's
in Irish'.

I'm not Irish and maybe I just didn't get it. MINOR SPOILERS FROM HERE. What I got out of this film is:

Six guys leave Ireland 30 years ago to move to the UK. Five of them end up totally useless drunks while one guy makes it by moving away from that nonsense since they were all living in the same room.

It seems the guy that made it betrayed his friend/friends because he did NOT keep them on the payroll of a company he built. What was expected was for him to support the men who were drunk all day, didn't show up for work, but they should get a full day's pay so they can meet their bills and stay drunk 24 hours a day. Seems to be a truly entitled attitude to me. Nice work if you can get it.

Like I said, maybe I just didn't get it.",1468886400,,906,3.907608695652174
8277111,1,B001ADXX1E,"Didn't watch it because it isn't in English.  Please Amazon, give us a way to filter out non-English titles.  Really maddening to choose and then start a movie only to learn that it's a foreign language.",1466899200,,203,4.611111111111111
8277112,5,B001ADXX1E,"Colm Meaney (""Star Trek"") stars in ""Kings,"" a remarkable Irish drama (primarily spoken in Gaelic with English subtitles) about coming to terms with death and life's disappointments. However, Meaney is really one among many fine Irish actors in this complex ensemble piece (winner of five Irish Academy Awards) that manages to transcend the sum of its parts.

Like many modern European films, ""Kings"" starts out slowly and a bit confusingly in the middle of the story, as characters are introduced without any context. Despite this slow start, the film gradually builds into a story of startling emotional honesty. The story concerns a group of young friends who in 1977 emigrate from Northern Ireland to London, where they take construction jobs in hopes of escaping poverty back home. Years later, in 2007, one of them dies and his father travels to London to bring the body home. Reunited for the funeral, the now-distant friends gradually come together in a painful and powerful nightlong wake where old wounds gradually surface and are reconciled.

Essentially, this is a melancholy Irish movie about a group of friends who come together to fulfill their Catholic duty (corporal work of mercy) to bury the dead. The dramatic highpoint of the film is its extended ""Irish wake"" sequence in an old Irish bar, where alcohol and emotional honesty lead to several deep self-revelations and painful confrontations among the friends. But it's also a story about the failed dreams and disappointments of the immigrant experience in a new land, where the displaced persons never feel entirely at home. Astonishingly, the film manages to hold together a number of apparent Irish cliches (alcoholism, profanity, brawling, Catholicism, guilt, interrupted friendships, impossible promises, broken families and dreams) in a seamless tapestry of human feeling that resonates with authenticity. Despite the heavy subject matter, ""Kings"" never takes a false step or descends into melodrama, but always remains ""real.""

While the film is a downer in spots, it also manages to affirm healthy human relationships and the difficult choices they demand of us if we are to mature and grow. Meaney's character Joe Mullan, who feels guilty for not being there for the dead friend, was the first to abandon the circle of friends when he had a job opportunity in Manchester and saw that he couldn't go on living forever with 5 grown men in a small flat. He refuses to feel guilty for making money as a construction firm owner, but snorts cocaine to cope with the phoniness of his existence and can't bear to face the dead man's father. Meaney, the film's best-known actor, gets some of the showiest bits later on in the story as he accepts the painful necessity of entering the lives of his old friends one last time.

The friends, while as emotionally incomplete as Meaney, have achieved far less in life. Jap Kavanaugh, once the group's emotionally unstable ringleader who led the exodus to England as a young man, has become an unemployed wino completely lacking in mature human resources. The worst influence of the group, Jap rooms with Git, a co-dependent alcoholic who has nowhere else to go and fears abandoning his friends. Git, the only man among the friends who never outgrew the need to be in the orbit of Jap's controlling narcissism, is also the only friend who was with the deceased right before he died. Two other friends, who separated from Jap and Git many years before, are still struggling for emotional wholeness. One is Martin, a married man who abandoned the friends because they fed his alcoholism, leading his wife to make him promise to stop drinking or else end the marriage. The questions of whether Martin will drink again at the wake, whether he will continue drinking after it, and whether he will throw his family under the bus for his friends are treated compassionately in the film. The other friend, a fruit stand vendor, is the least well-developed character but also seems to be the best-adjusted of the group: He isn't as wealthy as Joe Mullan, but he appears to have accepted reality and his place in the world a long time ago. Meanwhile, the dead man's aging father plays an ambiguous role in the story, simultaneously guilt-tripping the boys with his unrealistic expectations while also demanding their respect as a good man who cares more for his son than for material possessions. In a relatively small role, the father emerges as one of the film's most vivid characters.

The film is subtitled in English, with very little native English dialogue spoken despite being set in England. Some of the more amusing scenes in the film occur as this group of strange and obsolete Gaelic Irishmen interact with bewildered modern Londoners. There are no memorable special features on the disc, but the film itself needs no sideshows to justify a purchase: It's as real as the sod that birthed it.",1430524800,3,4906,4.963503649635037
