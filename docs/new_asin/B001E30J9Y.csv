3545544,5,B001E30J9Y,"While this first volume focuses on Anime, this is definitely a must see.  As a brand new voice actor, I was fascinated to see the variety of working voice actors interviewed.

In particular, I really enjoyed the Extra where it simulates an actual recording session.

Highly recommended and worth the money.",1229472000,2,306,4.96078431372549
3545545,5,B001E30J9Y,"Whether you're a veteran voice actor or someone just starting to dip your toes in the voice acting waters, this is the DVD to buy. It provides sage advice about the business of voice acting, gives you behind-the-scenes access to some studio sessions so you can see what it's like behind the mic, and provides dozens of interviews with current voice actors, both new and seasoned, to give you all the motivation you could possibly need.

I highly recommend this DVD. Oh, and for all you Crispin Freeman fans out there... Yes, he's on the DVD, too!",1228435200,2,546,4.628865979381444
3545546,5,B001E30J9Y,"Whether you want to get into voice acting or are just curious about the faces behind the voices, Adventures in Voice Acting is a fantastic behind-the-scenes look into the voice-acting industry. The documentary is very fun to watch since it is split into five very informative sections. The questions were well thought out and very helpful. Watching my favorite actors' personalities in real life (hehe) was also a blast. I highly recommend this DVD for anyone who may be curious about voice acting for any platform. Waiting until next year for the game DVD is going to be difficult!",1228348800,9,582,4.888888888888889
3545547,5,B001E30J9Y,This is a great DVD.  It gives excellent insight to the Voice Acting world from the voices that we've come to know and love.  It's a great first step for anyone who is aspiring to being a voice actor.,1228262400,,200,4.102564102564102
3545548,5,B001E30J9Y,"Hey catz and kittenz, I love me some anime from way back. But this DVD is the first time I've gotten the skinny on what it's like to be in the industry from the people who know. Seriously, I went to school for acting and have been in a few major motion pictures, but this is the first time I had heard what VA is like from the horses mouth. Unfortunately I don't live in one of the 3 major anime VA cities (NY, LA or Houston), but it has really given me some ideas about moving. BTW if anyone is near Pittsburgh and going to Tekkoshocon be sure to hit up the Pittsburgh Anime Club!",1228262400,3,581,4.017241379310345
3545549,5,B001E30J9Y,"well maybe not everything but this provides a lot of information for fans who have always wanted to know more about how it works

especially great for anime fans (like myself) since it has interviews with voice actors like Steven Blum and Crispin Freeman",1228262400,,254,4.7727272727272725
3545550,5,B001E30J9Y,"For anyone who has wanted to get into a very lucrative business, this DVD is nice for knowing the basics and what it's like to be a voice actor, as well as what it takes to be one. It's fun to watch, especially for anime fans.",1228262400,,226,3.9347826086956523

8296172,3,B001E30J9Y,"If your interested in animation, it's really interestin. I was looking for something that covered other aspects of voiceover, like radio, IVR, Internet, podcasts, audiobooks, etc.",1444608000,,179,5.923076923076923

8296174,5,B001E30J9Y,I bought this item for my son who is early into the industry of Voice Over Acting.  He found it especially inspiring and a good guide to some of the things to look forward to.  He recognized some of the names from conferences he has attended.  I was so pleased with his reaction. I felt great about my gift and so did he!!,1390262400,,322,4.079365079365079
8296175,4,B001E30J9Y,"I rarely write negative review but the problem is, I got the dvd but the case it came in was of shoddy make and was broken.  The dvd likely was bounced around inside the broken case quite a bit because when I took it out for the first time, one, the part the holds the dvd in place fell to pieces (literally) and second, the dvd itself was scratched so much it wouldn't play...at all.  I'd love to give a good review but the product wasn't watchable and I'm afraid to get another because I'm afraid will be of no higher quality.  I've had a desire to learn about the business to maybe even some day get behind a microphone and be able to voice act.  This dvd said it would give some good first steps...well it didn't even make it to the introduction...I'm very disappointed.

Alright let me start out by saying that all the above is still true, I'm still mad about the product and how it arrived to me, but that being said, I did get to watch the show, turns out a friend bought a copy and it was not screwed from the get-go.  So I watched the show, and I found it very enjoyable, it wasn't pandering to anyone, it wasn't saying that getting into voice acting would be any easy thing to do, in fact it said quite the opposite.  The stories told here are unique, genuine, and mostly tell tale so caution, hard work, and learning to relax, let things slide.  If you're like me and have this amazing fantasy about voice acting...well that's what it is a fantasy, very few will ever really know your name nor are they willing to pay big money for a singular project that would make someone live the Hollywood lifestyle as it were.  The show basically says you need to be willing to sacrifice to succeed, willing to work hard and be constantly learning, and most importantly of all, be able to handle rejection and keep your nose to the grindstone looking for work, constantly.  Not something you're going to able to quit your day job for.  Not at first anyway.  This particular lesson in ""volume 1"" which assumes there will be a volume 2 and 3 is about Anime and acting with the timers, lip sync, etc.  Looks tough but practice makes perfect.  Based on the cover of the box (and the intro) volumes 2 and 3 (likely assuming volume 1 will be successful) will be about voices in video games and voices in general animation respectively.  When those may come out?  Who knows?  But if they are informative as this first dvd they will get high marks in my book, which is why I came back to apologize for giving the product itself a crap rating when the product itself is good stuff.  The product packaging on the other hand leaves something to be desired.  Then again, maybe I got the one defective package in the whole shooting match.  Either way this is the first time I've ever come back to take a product from a low rating (1 star) to a higher rating and explain why.  So, to end like I do many of my other postings:  Thanks for reading and have a nice day!",1366588800,,2951,4.307971014492754
8296176,4,B001E30J9Y,"""How are you doing everybody, life treating you good""?!?! I have many reason that I've bought this product beside just loving the anime of course. I am not really good with words, but will do the best I can.. It all started when I was in college and there was this particular anime I fell in love with, but anyway, years passed by and have many choice of what I wanted to do. After carefully watching and listened to people who've made great sacrifice to do, and getting the job done... My eye's was just in awww, and thinking to myself that - there was no waaayy I can compete with many talented people in the DVD, but they did gave some good advice if or when I or other people decide to start this cool career. This DVD was, and still is worth buying - thank you.

8296177,5,B001E30J9Y,"My nine year old son is a big fan of all things related to Japanese animation otherwise known as anime. Since anime is more complex and thought-provoking than typical cartoons I preview material to keep us both out of trouble. My son is also interested in HOW anime is created.  This DVD provides information on how actors use their voices to develop characters for anime. The DVD is divided up into stand alone chapters explaining aspects of the creative process as well as the realities of the industry. Each chapter uses voice actors to explain a process or skill required for success. Several chapters also allow the audience to interact and practice as if they were an actor. At the end of each chapter parents can review and explore main ideas with the child.  It was delightful to watch my son suddenly recognize an actor by their voice, ""DAD! That's Nagisa's voice!"" Watching him begin to understand the difference between an actor, with a distinct personality, from the anime voice he hears also prompted multiple discussions. If your child watches anime and is interested in learning more about the process I would endorse this DVD. It would also be a good introduction for new drama students.",1314576000,2,1203,4.834951456310679
8296178,3,B001E30J9Y,"This is an excellent, enjoyable, and informative DVD. However, for someone who is not particularly a fan of Anime but is an aspiring voice actor, I thought that more of the nuts and bolts of the business of voice acting would have been most helpful, with less emphasis placed on Anime. Most, if not all, of the VAs on the disk are Anime actors. I also would have liked to see exploration of the audition process in greater detail. If you're interested in working in Anime, this DVD is a great choice; it's also worthwhile as part of the learning journey for any aspiring VAs, even with the emphasis on Anime.",1296259200,3,608,4.486486486486487
8296179,5,B001E30J9Y,"This documentary is billed as a tool for aspiring voice actors, but is a great watch for anyone. The show interviews many voice actors, dialogue directors, casting directors, etc. The focus here is on people involved in anime, but most, if not all, of the people interviewed have had experience in many different VA fields. The documentary flows well with wonderful camera work and editing. The stories told by everyone are fun and insightful. The whole thing is a blast to watch again and again. Way to go, Bang Zoom. If you ever decide to make the other 2 documentaries in the series(voice acting in video games and American animation), go ahead. I will be first in line to buy them.",1275264000,,685,4.669421487603306
8296180,5,B001E30J9Y,"If you've ever thought about getting into the field of voice acting, this is a great DVD to have. It will make you think a bit...""do I really want to do this?"" Well worth the money.",1244160000,,181,4.055555555555555
