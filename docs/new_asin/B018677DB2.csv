7540898,5,B018677DB2,"Anna Yorks third DVD is a perfect complement to her first two DVDs. I have Parkinsons disease, and I use all three to help improve my symptoms and keep myself feeling good.

Parkinsons causes my joints and muscles to tighten up, and the warm-ups help me loosen up and get moving in the morning or other times during the day. I have always had a tendency to move too quickly. Now that I have Parkinsons disease, I need to learn to move more carefully. Anna has worked with neurologically challenged clients for many years. Her approach to Tai Chi focuses on moving all the body parts with deliberate, smooth motions. My balance has also become unstable. The warm-up exercises help me improve my posture and gait so I can avoid falls and move with more confidence. As always, Annas instructions are easy to follow and given in a calm, soothing voice. The format is divided in such a way that I can jump around to work on specific movements or go in order for a full body workout.

 Learning Tai Chi with Anna is fun and spiritually fulfilling. I highly recommend it.",1449792000,18,1064,4.53125
7540899,5,B018677DB2,"As a sufferer of osteoarthritis in both knees, lower back and neck, I wanted a movement exercise that wouldn't put too much strain on my joints. I wanted to strengthen my core, improve my balance and overall health. Enter Anna York and her great dvd's, Tai Chi-Qigong has really helped me with my strength, mobility, balance, and even my reflexes. The bonus  is the inspiration of Anna's story, the stunning scenery and view along the coast, and the music. This dvd will help me to continue to improve my health, my foremost wealth. She explains each exercise in a clear and concise manner, even the birds understand. I have all of her dvd's in my toolbox, right next to the cane that I used to use everyday, now not so much. Instead of investing in gym memberships that you will probably never really use. Invest in Anna and her wisdom, I can arrest to the benefits she has brought into my life with this ancient practice Tai Chi-Qigong. Enjoy!!!",1448928000,29,947,4.603550295857988

I found it extremely helpful to follow as a daily practice to loosen my spine, neck, back, and knees! The buyer need not be intimidated by Tai-Chi Qigong, if not familiar, for it is fun, relaxing and  a great way to get the energy flowing in the morning and starting the day at the top of the world.

7540901,5,B018677DB2,"For the past 25 to 30 years I had lower back pain and my knees were killing me as well.  After following the DVDs by Anna York for a couple of years, I suddenly realized that I no longer suffered from that back pain plus I had no need for the prescription that I had been taking for my knee pain! It was truly wonderful to the awakening of my own body and discovering that I could handle and change things in my life. Anna's DVD is good not just for the body but also for your mind and soul as well.",1448668800,15,499,3.892156862745098
7540902,5,B018677DB2,"I bought this for my 89 year old mom. She had seen something about Qigong on TV and wanted to try it. I ordered several dvds for her to try out, and this was her hands-down favorite. I have watched it and done it with her, and I agree. It's gentle, but thorough, and the scenery is beautiful- she says the scenery makes her look forward to doing it. She also likes that it shows older people doing the routines.",1503187200,4,411,4.15

7540936,5,B018677DB2,"While Healing from Foot Surgery, Anna's DVD,"" Muscle, Joint and Fascia Warm-ups"" was so helpful in moving my body  and getting circulation going.  I was missing my YMCA  classes so I was grateful for body movement on a very limited basis.  Being able to stand a few minutes then sit through most of the video  while getting my hips, torso, joints active made each day better.  Even my grandkids like the shaking, the lion and the Charleston.  Since I have a second foot surgery  soon, I  will count on this video and the first of Anna's videos to keep me in  good condition as I heal and get ready to ""dance"" once again.",1457481600,15,620,4.407079646017699

7540940,4,B018677DB2,"This video is a little too easy for me, but does provide a good stretching workout.  It would be particularly useful for older adults - I am only in my early 60's - who need to work on strengthening the lower body to improve balance, who need to increase their flexibility, or improve their overall range of motion.  It is very, very easy to follow, even for beginners. And the ""seated version"" is a plus for those who can't stand to do this sort of workout.",1451865600,40,458,4.313953488372093
7540941,5,B018677DB2,"I would like to highly recommend Anna York's newest DVD, ""Tai Chi-Qigong Muscle, Joint and Fascia Warm-Ups"".  This beautiful video is the latest of four DVDs in which Anna York instructs, demonstrates and makes it possible to help us heal and care for ourselves.  Each previous video has been excellent and I personally know many with varying diseases such as MS, Parkinson's, Fibromyalgia and stroke survivors, who have greatly benefitted from Anna York's videos that are designed to be easy to follow and use at your own pace.  I  have been able to postpone knee replacement surgery because the exercises in this video are so effective at helping me greatly reduce my knee pain.

The "" Tai Chi-Qigong Muscle, Joint and Fascia Warm-Ups""DVD, makes it easy to experience more mobility, range of motion and lessen pain and inflammation.  The video is just as effective for those who need to remain seated as it is for those who are able to stand and do the movements.  It addresses our fascia, which have not been taken into consideration in other videos as contributors to our pain and discomfort when they lock up and stop the flow of energy.  As usual, Anna York proves to be an amazing teacher as we learn additional information about our bodies and how we can take care of them.

This video literally ""soars"" as Anna York takes us on a new journey towards healing and comfort. Please take this journey with her and amaze yourself at what you can achieve.",1449964800,54,1457,4.7272727272727275

Not too bad for the price but I've found other DVDs I much prefer. Donated this one to the local lending library so I certainly won't buy any of her other DVDs which are more expensive.
