5509417,3,B00ATDEI3S,"Well I was asked to review this film.  Don't expect much and you won't be disappointed was all I was thinking while watching this brassy sassy un-Christian movie that may have been Dove approved but I threw it away.  I don't like ""attitude"" especially among ""so called"" Christians.  I didn't like the characters and found them to be too spoiled for my taste.  A lot of people who say they love God don't seem to love anybody.  This movie, apparently trying to get that crowd to buy, proved that to me.  I gave it 3 stars because the seller was prompt and courteous.  As for the film, no no not that!",1448755200,3,599,4.342342342342342
5509418,1,B00ATDEI3S,We turned this off after 5 minutes.  The acting is so bad.  The positive reviews lead me to believe they were written by friends and family of the cast.,1447804800,2,152,4.206896551724138

5509424,5,B00ATDEI3S,"So many times we complain about the ""junk"" out there to watch.  This is a movie with a good, positive message that everyone is valuable and everyone has issues...some are more easily seen and some are very hidden.  Every New Day Pictures and Brittany Goodwin do a great job with the cinematography.  They both have a bright future in movies.  The story is about a group of high school students stranded in a school after a large snow storm moves in and puts an unlikely bunch of students trapped inside to endure the bad weather.  Sometimes in life's storms we have an opportunity to learn a little more about ourselves.  In the movie the characters bond in an unlikely setting and you get the feeling they will be changed for the better...forever...together ;-).",1357862400,6,763,4.6992481203007515
5509425,3,B00ATDEI3S,sweet movie -- great for teens if they would sit still through it,1483660800,,65,4.076923076923077
5509426,4,B00ATDEI3S,It was a good movie . It reminded me a little of the movie Breakfast Club.,1483660800,,74,3.6875
5509427,3,B00ATDEI3S,"A Christian message movie that isn't too heavy handed.  Kids stuck in snowstorm try to understand and reach out to each other.  When one student  reveals that his dad was just killed in Iraq the student ""preacher"" thoughtlessly says that this was part of ""God's plan.""  Other than that the movie was enjoyable.",1483228800,,310,4.7924528301886795

5509429,3,B00ATDEI3S,The development of the different student was well done and the added storm gave some drama. At the end the director really blow it. You had a raging snow storm most of the night. The next day only a couple of inches snow on the grown really. That blow the hole movie.,1482883200,,267,4.153846153846154
5509430,1,B00ATDEI3S,It took me  two minutes to realize this movie is populated by terrible actors. Enough of a reason to seek my luck somewhere else.,1482710400,,129,4.375
5509431,5,B00ATDEI3S,"An enjoyable film with themes of gratitude, leadership, teamwork, mutual acceptance, unification and connectedness.

5509436,4,B00ATDEI3S,I read the reviews and expected it to be super cheesy and predictable and it was.  but it was nice to watch a clean movie dealing with real issues in a not negative way.  I would recommend it but also say it's a low budget film that did ok.,1482019200,,240,3.877551020408163
5509437,2,B00ATDEI3S,"The positive message is about all this film has going for it. There were a few times the actors and actresses got into their roles (mostly during the upbeat, fun scenes); however, most of the time they sounded as though they were simply reading lines from a script with no emotions (especially in the serious scenes or the scenes wherein the characters were supposed to be surprised or scared or upset). I put more emotion into a dry read for an audition and managed to get a role after reading 2 lines. Why, oh why, do ""Christian"" films end up being the cheesiest films on the market? Where is the dedication to the art of film-making and acting? While I'm sure the actors and actresses are good-hearted, loving, Christian people, and we do need more wholesome films, my kids and I kept saying this film is borderline humorous.",1481932800,2,828,4.601351351351352

Secrets are revealed and new unlikely friendships are forged. The kids learn a lot about each other and themselves, and learn compassion for others.

5509448,3,B00ATDEI3S,Typical teen movie where there are snobby kids and the other kids; they have to spend the night together at school and end up becoming good friends.  Acting is kind of lame and the actors seem to forget their lines.....or it's just very long pauses that don't make any sense.  Good for whole family to watch.,1469404800,,308,4.482142857142857

5509452,5,B00ATDEI3S,"This was a really cute, enjoyable film, with a subtle message woven in between the lines. If you are looking for something clean, entertaining, and positive to watch, you just might really like this.

I was originally hesitant to view it, as another reviewer had compared it to a Breakfast Club rip off, and gave it only three stars. I had also read a few other poor reviews, and was a bit turned off. However, I am glad that I watched it anyways, because while it does have SOME things in common with the Breakfast Club, and has its share of faults too, it is entirely its own film and a nice movie to watch that does not have a bunch of deep, sordid garbage to deal with.
,
Yes, it is a high school flick. Yes, that means it is light, airy, and everything wraps itself up neatly in the end. But sometimes, it is a reprieve to watch a film like that. The pace moved along really well, and I did not find it slow at all (as one other reviewer had suggested).

However, I do have ONE complaint - and this is a SPOILER ALERT from here on out: the scene at the end, when they go outside after this supposed ""record breaking,"" terrible blizzard that has locked them all inside the school overnight...they wander out into snow that is so shallow their shoes do not even really sink into it! Terribly unrealistic, by a long shot. If that was all they were dealing with, they could have all easily found a way home.

But strange snow scene aside, this is a great film for anyone looking for something clean, light, airy, enjoyable, and with a positive message woven in between the lines.",1465689600,3,1580,4.331081081081081
5509453,3,B00ATDEI3S,"Slow moving, horrible acting and I kept thinking The Breakfast Club rip off. Same # of students stuck in school overnight, the rich brat, the goody-two-shoes, the weird girl, the angry boy, etc. Lessons learned, secrets shared, teens figuring things out, a lot of apologizing and a lot of walking around the school in the dark. I did watch the entire thing but was so tempted many times to end it. Pretty much wish I had before the end. This horrible, treacherous, close-the-roads and -send-the-students-home-early in the day wretched winter storm that took the power out ends up being, at the end of the day, about 2"" of snow. As the camera pulls away at the very end before the credits, the roof of the school is seen with hardly any snow on it. So stupid.",1461456000,2,758,4.580882352941177

8557509,5,B00ATDEI3S,"Really great movie.  I watch a lot of movies of this genre, and I have to say this was one of my favorites.  The story is simple but but has depth that can appeal to most people.  I liked the premise of very different teens being stuck together in a snowstorm.  Throughout the day and night they learn about one another and see that everyone has imperfections and faults.  Each begins to see themselves as more ""normal"" and like everyone else.  My favorite character was Mary Jake, who really changed from the snooty rich popular girl that we all hated in high school to a really nice person once she realized the true meaning of friendship.  The teens were very insightful and introspective, which was a refreshing change from most movies that depict youth as just egotistical jerks that are incapable of thinking about anyone other than themselves (which sadly in our culture is becoming more common).  The christian message was present, but was very subtle.  Overall it was a feel good movie that was entertaining.  Clean, fun, and perfect for a family movie night or a night of good entertainment.  Highly recommend.
  Many of the negative reviews center on the lower budget filming and acting.  I really didn't see that as much in this film as in others, but I know what to expect from these types of movies- you are watching for content not high end special effects or actors.  I thought it was believable and realistic.",1486339200,2,1426,4.670682730923695
