7989959,4,B000093NUC,"I decided to buy this package rather than just getting ""Angel Sanctuary"" by itself, and I think it's a great deal. I'd never seen ""Harlock Saga"" before, and this DVD gives you the entire series here, which is quite long and definitely gives your money's worth. It's a slightly different style of anime than Angel Sanctuary, looks like it's a bit older; also by contrast, there's no real blood or nudity or incest or tribes of warring archangels. However, there are space pirates, mysterious pipe-organs, and tribes of warring gods and ancient creatures-- it's like a space-pirate version of the ""Ring of the Nibelungen"". Classy. And Captain Harlock has some incredibly stylish scars to go with that foxy pirate outfit.
As for ""Angel Sanctuary"", what can one say that everyone else hasn't gushingly said before? It's the most eye-hurtingly beautiful, wild, erotic, daring girl-anime out there today. Those mentally-imbalanced angels, those multiple dismemberments and decapitations, those long-legged schoolboys with the dewy eyes, yoicks!! Sadly, the end of the story leaves you hanging almost in mid-action.... Those of us who can't read Japanese (so as to get the printed manga for the whole story) are all praying anxiously & patiently for more of the series to become available.
The only faults I can find with this DVD issue (both disks) is that the chapters/programs in the menu are each too long... It could use finer separation, so that you don't have to scroll forward & back to find the point within the chapter you want. They also left the beginnning & end credits for all of the separate episodes, which is an annoyance to fast-forward through. However, that's only a minor annoyance. Great deal in general.",1066780800,21,1719,5.035087719298246
