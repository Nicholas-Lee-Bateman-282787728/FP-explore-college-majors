3829406,5,B001Y44DW2,"My daughter loves to sing and dance along with the Hi-5 crew. There are hours of entertainment on this 3 disc set. A great value for the price. My only (personal) dislike is that each disc has all of the same music on it. The episodes are different, but the opening and closing song are the same for each episode on the disc. Monotonous though it may be, repetition is a great way for kids to learn. I look forward to the release of season 3.",1254700800,,442,4.151162790697675
3829407,4,B001Y44DW2,"Grandchildren love this DVD.  Upbeat and educational, lots of variety yet stays on theme until songs and dances can be memorized. The only problem is that the DVD is continuous, so the 20 shows cannot be called up individually.  I bought both the 1st & 2nd season which were well received.",1252540800,,289,4.647058823529412
3829408,5,B001Y44DW2,I use this product for my kindergarten and 1st grade students at school and they LOVE Hi-5!  It's very hip and educational and every student I have is enthralled by the show!,1252195200,,174,4.4375
3829409,5,B001Y44DW2,"I have three kids...a 12 year old son, and two daughters 6 and 3.  They ALL enjoy Hi-5. This show which we first started watching on TLC Discovery for Kids morning programming...has been much beloved since my son was about 5.  I purchased Season One and Season Two and they are a hit in my house.  I would recommend, if you are looking for other TLC morning shows: Peep and Todd's World... these, also, are great educational programming for young children.",1251676800,,456,4.604938271604938
3829410,5,B001Y44DW2,I purchased this for my 15month old son. He has loved this show since forever... We used to watch it (my huby & I ) when we feed him so now he recognizes the voices and songs. I love to watch him dance and get so excited!,1251072000,,221,3.723404255319149

8347900,5,B001Y44DW2,Kids love this. Even babies!,1407542400,,28,4.8
8347901,5,B001Y44DW2,"I am very pleased with the singing, dancing and animations of the HI-5 DVD. I have two grandaughters, a two and a four year old, and they both seemed to be magnitized to the screen whenever this DVD is playing. It definatly holds their interest. I would recomend this to anyone needing a ""Free Baby-sitter""! I plan on buying other seasons.",1287792000,,339,4.573770491803279
8347902,5,B001Y44DW2,"I bought this dvd for my son, he's two. He loves it and watches it almost everyday. It's educative and entertaining. I recommend it!!!",1279497600,,134,4.625
8347903,5,B001Y44DW2,My daughter and I watch these shows at least once every week. She loves to sing and dance with the show. The picture quality is better that the TV shows.,1273968000,,153,4.133333333333334
8347904,5,B001Y44DW2,"My daughter is 16 months and absolutely loves this show!  Whenever I put it in, she is right there to watch.  It comes with three discs and there are maybe two themes on each disc.  The songs are, I hate to admit, quite catchy.  I find myself humming them at work.  It teaches colors and shapes and even emotions and problem solving.  My daughter is too young to realize that she is learning by watching this, but she loves to dance when the music comes on.  I'll keep on buying Hi-5 until she stops watching it.",1267920000,,512,4.270833333333333
8347905,4,B001Y44DW2,"My kids ages 6,4 and almost 1 have enjoyed Hi-5 shows as well as I have.  When you purchase this season (although I am only stating from what I've seen, I have not seen the whole dvd set but my kids have), they will have a specific episode theme...let's say ""animals"" for example, they will have the theme song before and after an episode show and it may have different segments from the animals theme multiple times so therefore you will hear the same theme song more than you can handle.  It does not show the ""whole"" episode of a theme.  When looking at reviews I would like to know about the actual product.  So I hope this helps someone.",1264204800,,642,4.325
8347906,3,B001Y44DW2,"My daughters love this show, but this is the third go-around of releasing the same material, this time with worse sound quality.  Also, my set only came with two of the three discs.",1261785600,,181,4.484848484848484
8347907,5,B001Y44DW2,My two year old girl loves this video.  Lots of dancing and music.  Excellent interaction.,1261526400,,90,4.933333333333334
