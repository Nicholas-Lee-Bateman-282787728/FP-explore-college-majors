4495829,5,B004XK933I,"Recently, I've tried several chemistry books and DVDs, and I believe this one is the best!

The series is structured logically and each one builds for the next.
I highly recommend this series for anyone who wants to get a handle on chemistry and go on to ace the class.",1353628800,,269,4.38
8447021,4,B004XK933I,Great presentation- it just doesn't follow my son's curriculum.  Different arrangement of subject matter and a wide range of difficulty compared to my sons course. Great for a basic review if you have the time.,1491091200,,210,5.0
8447022,5,B004XK933I,Jason is a superb teacher. Bravo!,1484956800,,33,4.666666666666667
8447023,5,B004XK933I,"Jason Gibson is a genius!! I ordered all of his chemistry, his calculus and all of his physics!! So far I have just completed the chemistry and I have such a greater understanding because of this man.  He breaks everything down to such a simple easy to understand format. Please, Jason Gibson, come out with an organic chemistry tutor DVD set!!",1423008000,,344,4.639344262295082
8447024,5,B004XK933I,"I used this to prepare for my first Gen Chem course ever! College courses are of course more detailed, but this helped me get a prior understanding and made everything clear in the course!",1401926400,,188,4.5588235294117645
8447025,2,B004XK933I,"I was really hoping for something more than a lecture. I'm still searching for a program that contains illustrative graphics, maybe computer animated. I don't understand why someone can't develop a visually appealing tutorial for chemistry. This is only good for people who learn well by listening and watching, which does not include me or my son. Please, someone develop something more appealing for people who struggle in science.",1391817600,,433,5.2898550724637685
8447026,5,B004XK933I,Great informative educational DVD. This is helping with my studies. Just what I needed. Would recommend this product to others.,1384041600,,127,5.4
8447027,5,B004XK933I,"I got these dvds for my husband, who is going to nursing school.  He watched these before his chemistry class, and he said it made a huge difference.  Jason Gibson makes everything easy to understand, and is not at all boring.  Get these for any class that you need to take - you won't regret it.",1371600000,,296,4.25
8447028,5,B004XK933I,"This volume of Jason's Chemistry DVDs picks up where his first one leaves off.  Going into chemical equations, chemical reactions and Stoichiometry.  If you are taking college level General Chemistry I it will, depending on how your book is laid out, cover about another 1.5 to 2 chapters of material.  Jason gives a lot of examples of how to solve problems, but just as useful he gives you a ton of tips on how to approach the problems.  In some instances that stuff is just as useful, if not more so, than going through the problems themselves.

The information Jason gives on balancing chemical equations, and a simple tip he gives (that apparently not all books and teachers tell you) for situations when you get all but one part of the equation balanced and the unbalanced part is not a clean even multiple of any others is worth the price of the set alone.  And keeping true to the style of how he goes through the math and physics and circuits DVDs he always tells you why he is doing what he is, and walks you through step-by-step.

Whether you find this helpful or not will depend in large part to how you learn.  If you are a book learner or need to interact with a tutor/teacher this will not help you much.  If you are a visual or audio learner and the thought of a marker board lecture does not bore you to death, then this is a great investment.  The thing that sets Jason's DVDs apart from some of the web based material you can find is that is goes in order, and combines a lecture with problem solving examples.  He teaches you enough theory and background that you can understand the subject, but then gives you a lot more examples than you are likely to get in a traditional class. He shows you the kind of problems that you are most likely to encounter on a quiz or test (depending on your teacher), but usually not the hardest problems you might get as homework.  I have most of Jason's material (aside from the basic math DVDs) and they have helped me get through all levels of math and physics with a 4.0 average.  I still had to put in a lot of hard work of my own, but I would recommend his DVDs to anyone having trouble with the material or anyone who is looking for self-study material to get ready for a class.",1370822400,2,2238,4.338129496402877
8447029,5,B004XK933I,"I am beginning to find out i am an audiovisual learner, I love the video so helpful than fliping through the Chemistry pages..lol",1367452800,,129,4.6521739130434785
8447030,5,B004XK933I,"this will without a doubt clear up the subject without question.
Jason Gibson is without any doubt a fantastic teacher,concise ,clear,and enjoyable.
thank you amazon",1365638400,,165,5.64
