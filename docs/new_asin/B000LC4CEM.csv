8160798,3,B000LC4CEM,"Too much explanations before execution of barre and center works. It could be great for some viewers. Given I am taking Ballet as alternative workout and after work leisure for stress relief, I reckon Dmitri Roudnev's DVD series are much better for my own enjoyment.",1229904000,3,266,4.933333333333334
8160799,3,B000LC4CEM,"This DVD is not what I was hoping for.  I was hoping for more tips, common mistakes to watch out for, and simple exercises that I could do at home to help me with my turns.  Instead, it's basically a pirouette class with a minimal focus on tips and exercises.  This isn't to say that there isn't a lot of instruction, there is, but it's basically just describing the steps.  So if you're not familiar with the steps, the DVD would be instructive.  But because there's so much talking, and the combinations take up so much floor space, it's not even serviceable at home as a substitute for a pirouette class.  So I've watched it once, and will probably watch it again to see if I can catch anything I might have missed the first time, and then it will no doubt start collecting dust on my shelves.",1214784000,3,796,4.344594594594595
