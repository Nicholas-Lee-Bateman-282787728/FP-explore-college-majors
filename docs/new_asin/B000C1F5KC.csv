8111025,5,B000C1F5KC,"Great DVD! The methods are simply laid out, it's entertaining, and all around easy to follow.

I also recommend Ike's book: Fishing on the Edge.",1238716800,,144,4.76
8111026,2,B000C1F5KC,"Ike's video was very dissapointing to me. He only covers very basic informantion and not much of that for the price.  There are many better and less expensive videos available.
Shop around and save money and get more information!",1208736000,,229,4.871794871794871
8111027,4,B000C1F5KC,Great for Begginers. It does have the key general issues for Bass Fishing which was very helpful to undestand that it takes a lot more than buy a rod and go fishing. I have not gone fishing yet after viewing the video.,1179187200,,218,4.214285714285714
8111028,3,B000C1F5KC,"Ike is very enthusiastic, especially when he turns from the camera and speaks to a tree or bush. Ike likes lists. (Reminds me of ROTC class in college.) Ike says if I want to catch bass, I should read lots of fishing magazines. We learn to buy TOPO maps and draw circles on them. (Was this guy in ROTC?) But the map class was actually useful, because we learn how to track the migration of bass during the seasons. Don't know that it was $20 useful, but I have to say I hadn't thought of that before. Ike tells you how to pack the boat. (More lists, this guy must have been in ROTC). Anyway, Ike's DVD does have information - unlike that Crappie DVD by Visual Films.",1167436800,3,666,4.2109375
8111029,3,B000C1F5KC,I found this dvd very slow moving with very basic info... if you already bass fish then you know most of this information any way... unless you have never fished your wasting your time.,1163462400,,185,4.470588235294118
8111030,4,B000C1F5KC,This video has some of the best information for finding and locating bass on new lakes. He goes into detail on how to approach a new body of water,1143331200,5,146,4.068965517241379
8111031,5,B000C1F5KC,Ike's video is a great introduction to taking your bass fishing skills up a notch. Good resource for having better success on the water without spending thousands of dollars on equipment and tackle. He does a great job breaking it (seasonal patterns / presentations) down and giving you the tools and techniques necessary to have a better than average day on the lake. The graphics and presentation of the video really adds to the quality. No cheesy video transitions or lame 80's music here. Git some.,1142899200,5,502,4.848837209302325
8111032,5,B000C1F5KC,this was one of the better videos i've seen on fishing. most videos just show you someone fishing and talking but not really showing you how. ike really explains it and demonstrates it well. i hope he puts out more.,1141689600,8,215,4.4
8111033,5,B000C1F5KC,"I often thought about the mystery of Bass Fishing's popularity. I now know what it's all about. Ike is a consumate salesman for his sport. The content, the graphics,the sound and instructional quality make this teaching DVD a wonder!!! EVERY fisherman should have one if only to understand why millions love this ""crazy"" sport. P.S. I fish in Long Island Sound.

8111034,5,B000C1F5KC,"I'm no kid, and this is the best bass fishing video I ever saw.  It's got all kinds of good tips, and it's even fun to watch. That Ike is a real character! Like the two movie guys used to say, two thumbs up.",1132012800,9,207,3.7045454545454546
