8595571,5,B00DOZNJCY,"This is a well researched and produced documentary, well worth watching. It brings light to an area of the armies, both North and South, that is not mentioned in most if not all books on the Civil War.  What we tend to forget is horses and mules ""served"" and were rightfully ""soldiers"" and ""veterans"" of that war, and were thought of that way by the majority of the men that served with these animals.
What is staggering too is the logistics of keeping these animals fed and cared for while on the march and how much hay and grain they required each and every day. Do you know how many horses were used to pull and serve the 6 cannons in a federal artillery battery?  Watch this video and you will find out. Think of this for a moment too: the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, when it invaded Pennsylvania, the length of the train of supply wagons was 57 miles! Think about how many horses and mules were involved in that. This documentary is worth viewing to expands one's knowledge and scope of this war. The information that is presented requires multiple viewings to absorb it all. This IS a video worth watching.",1494547200,,1123,4.5
