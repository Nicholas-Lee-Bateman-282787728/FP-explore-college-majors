8146627,5,B000IOM2CC,"One of my favourite actor is Kenny Doughty, as he played a 'double role' I loved the film twice as much!",1399161600,,104,4.0
8146628,5,B000IOM2CC,"I first saw this movie on Netflix and I loved it so much I bought it from Amazon.  This quirky little movie was so outlandishly funny that it caught me by surprise.  If you are in the mood for a goofy, laugh out loud situational romantic comedy then this movie is definitely for you!",1364342400,,283,4.222222222222222
8146629,1,B000IOM2CC,"Watching the movie, I was struck by the lack of emotion the Rachel Leigh Cook had at cheating on her fiance, the day before their wedding, with a man she thought was a priest.
Then I realized, ""The 'priest' has been lying to her from the beginning. And has no remorse about it and only is concerned with breaking up her possible marriage, even trying to pimp out his so-called best female friend to seduce the fiance (which doesn't work).""
So it became obvious to me: the two lead characters are PERFECT FOR EACH OTHER. They're both liars without any regret over who they hurt in their pursuit of ""love"".
This movie isn't particularly funny or even amusing. The plot and characters are completely unbelievable.
But the love story between two people lacking common sense or a moral compass? Is perfect in every way.
One star for the beautiful city the movie was filmed in and the physical attractiveness of the cast.",1297555200,,915,4.654320987654321
8146630,1,B000IOM2CC,"This movie is just plain awful.
The entire 90 minute torture-session is predicated on one big misunderstanding that could have easily been remedied if either of the characters were remotely deep. Ultimately, the heroes antics, designed to be ""cute"" are actually just stalkerish and weird...and I'm not entirely certain why we as viewers should believe that the heroine falls for him whatsoever.
There aren't even any decent secondary characters to carry this atrocious plotline.
Big, big miss.",1257465600,,493,5.415584415584416
8146631,2,B000IOM2CC,I found myself waiting for the end.  The characters weren't very enduring and the plot was pretty boring.,1206403200,3,105,4.833333333333333
8146632,4,B000IOM2CC,"This movie is not ""deep"" on any level..It is predictable and pretty hard to believe, but come on..It's cute.  The leads are cute, the supporting actors are cute and the plot is cute.  No one i the cast is taking their part too seriously.  Guys, don't watch this without your sweetie nearby...Makes it a pretty good movie.  The whole thing is one implausable act after another, but this film is not trying to take itself seriously and I don't see how a viewer could either.  This one is worth a look.  Speaking of cute..How about that Rachel Leigh Cook?",1172793600,6,552,4.525252525252525
8146633,1,B000IOM2CC,"The premises is fairly weak to start with, you should be thinking alone the line - yeah right, that's going to happen, the product description pretty much sum up the whole movie.  However, hopeful, you want to get some good laughs from the various tricks the guy used to get the girl within the 96 min runtime.  Unfortunately, those schemes are not very funny, nor smart, fairly off the wall.  Not much chance for acting from Rachael Leigh Cook, and Kenny Doughty, very plain silly expressions throughout, just shots after shots of young and pretty smiles.  The supporting actors/actresses didn't add much either.

Note that the DVD has no subtitle also, sometimes can be hard to make out what male lead said with his British accent.",1167609600,3,733,4.785714285714286
