7490372,5,B0176SAQIY,"Excellent resource for beginner and experienced student alike.  The full form and individual movement demonstrations and instructions are clear, easy to understand, and rich in detail.  A section on general guidelines is included and I found this section very helpful not only with this form but with other forms I practice.  Helen's instructions are very approachable and her conversational presentation will put students at ease while also conveying the detail and insights of a master practitioner.

What was most surprising about this video is the excellent photography and soundtrack in both the outdoor and studio settings.  I've viewed many such videos and the quality of the camera, lighting, and sound work is some of the best I've seen and heard.  The overall tone and pace of the video captures the spirit of tai chi very well.  I'll be referencing this resource often.

The 24 form is a great starting point for new students and a smart part of an experienced students portfolio.  As the mostly widely practiced form of tai chi you can find fellow students to practice with anywhere.  It is simple enough to learn the movements fairly easily but rich enough to always find more to learn.  I learned this form late in my martial arts ""career"" and find it a wonderful form for refining fundamentals and working the internal elements that make tai chi such a great health practice.",1451174400,38,1390,4.948275862068965
7490373,5,B0176SAQIY,"Being a long-time student of Tai Chi, I really enjoyed Simplified Tai Chi for Beginners. In this film Miss Helen LIang teaches, demonstrates and explains the art of Tai Chi. She does so in an easy to follow, beautiful to watch and learn the twenty four long form of Tai Chi.

First, Miss Liang does a walk-through of the movements where she explains and shows how each movement is done. She performs slowly and points out the little moves which might be overlooked by the viewer. She does the Basic Guidlines with an explanation and importance of posture as well as the movements.

In the following chapter the instructor, Miss Liang, does the actual forms which are shown in detail and all the while giving a talk through of the movements. Miss Liang goes through the exercises in such an effortless flow that she makes the viewer want to get up and start practicing immediately. The forms are done in real time and once learned are easy to follow along. Views of the forms are shown in front, side and rear so they are easier to learn and show how they should be performed properly.

This interesting and entertaining DVD is more than worth the money and would lay an excellent foundation for anyone who desires to learn Tai Chi. The serious student could use this as a learning tool while studying under a Tai Chi instructor or to try to learn the basics on his/her own.

Miss Liang also explains that the student should practice several times a week over a period over several months in order to become more proficient. As she says, it cannot be learned overnight but it is worth the effort to gain the knowledge of beginning Tai Chi.

Highly recommended for the beginner student and an excellent tune-up for the Intermediate.",1450569600,162,1730,4.62214983713355

I am a tai chi instructor and I highly recommend this DVD, Simplified Tai Chi for Beginners -24 form.  Master Helen Liang does a great job in instructing and introducing beginners to this 24 form.

I actually have a condition with coordination that my doctor wanted me to take expensive classes for. (I had no desire to crawl around on the floor like an infant.) I didn't know if I would be able to do this. While it is difficult and time consuming for me to learn; I'm finding that I can do it. I enjoy it and will do it in the future as long as I'm able.
I would highly recommend this for anyone with chronic illness. I can truly tell a difference in how I feel. The help with my coordination problem feels like a bonus compared with the health benefits I'm experiencing.",1510099200,6,728,4.170212765957447

7490396,5,B0176SAQIY,"Instructor Liang is inspiring and a great motivator. I like the way the video series is ordered because I can meditate and listen to her explain the reciprocal physiological operations of the body that interrelate and build strength and vitality in the body before practicing. Her teaching about posture and form is extremely informative. I trained in kungfu and can appreciate the discipline that her lessons instill.
I decided to train in Tai Chi to strengthen my leg and ankle after it was injured and required arthroscopic surgery. I know I cannot return to kungfu training until I strengthen my leg, ankle and body. So I decided to study Tai Chi. As a single parent, time is limited, so I needed to be able to study at my own pace. I'm so delighted that after reviewing several titles, I selected this one. I am a female and was delighted to see a female instructor. I'm evem more delighted that I selected her video because she's so awesome and resonates with me.

In this video, the instructor faces you. You spend so much time trying to allow your brain to figure out how to flip what you see, you get all kinds of confused. I can't do it. I've been trying long enough that it's too late to return. So, I guess I'll muster up some effort and try again.

7490457,5,B0176SAQIY,I am a longtime Martial Arts practitioner teaching my 1st Tai Chi Club.  My teachers are all long distance and I found Shifu Liang'a 24step dvd an excellent supliment to my training and teaching.  There are clearly shown and demonstrated details with basic applications.  I look forward to introducing to my students before the 108 Step Form.,1468627200,2,342,4.964912280701754
7490458,5,B0176SAQIY,"I have some background in martial arts (Tae-Kwon-Do) but very limited experience with Tai Chi. I learned the 8 Brocades several years ago to help with sore muscles but that has been my only real foray into Tai Chi. That said, Helen Liang's teaching was pretty fast and I found myself stopping and backing up the DVD quite a bit to make sure I had the movement correct. This form also requires a certain degree of balance.

What I absolutely loved about it was that she brings in an assistant after each move and shows the martial application. Coming from someone who practiced a hard form martial art it was very helpful to see why the move was being done rather than just ""follow this pattern"". That alone made Helen's teaching stand out to me. It was exciting to see how the gentle, flowing movements translated to blocks and throws against an opponent. For me, it really brought Tai Chi to life and got me interested in learning more.

So to summarize, it is a bit quick to follow and may be difficult for someone who is completely new to martial arts or Tai Chi but at the same time it offers a view of Tai Chi as a martial art. Helen also does an excellent job of explaining/showing how to perform the 24 form for those who want to learn it.

I can say that this DVD is true to the way Helen instructs her students, so it's like being at the school, albeit in a more personal setting. Helen reviews all the movements in a clear and concise manner, pointing out details for how and why particular movements should be done.  This is a great DVD for both the beginner learning Taiji for the first time as well as the advanced student looking to refine their style.  The DVD is about 2 hours long and covers the international standard 24 form Taiji, the entire routine can be practiced twice in about 15 minutes.",1468368000,3,760,4.573529411764706

7490463,3,B0176SAQIY,I have taken one intro to tai chi qigong class and bought this DVD to learn the specific moves before my next class. The instructor is good and easy to understand. Her voice is calm and she describes not only the moves but the metaphors for what the moves are designed to achieve. The only thing I'd change is that she's on white and the background is white. Hello!?  Hard to distinguish the subtleties of the turns and positions. Should be contrasting background or close up shots of some of the quieter moves.

7490480,3,B0176SAQIY,"I have to admit, this video is beautifully done. I've been doing exercise videos for about 15 years, stuff like P90X and Janis Saffell. My first intro to Tai Chi was when Janis and Scott Cole got together and did a mix of Tai Chi and Kickboxing. Since then I have done many of Scott Coles Tai Chi dvds. I know they are not super advanced Tai Chi, but he makes it easy to learn. I wanted something a little more advanced, so I tried this.

For people who have done dvd workouts, you know how the instructor facing the camera will usually move the left side of their body and call it the right side? Because of the mirror image. A very simple thing that makes following a workout so much easier. The biggest problem I have with this video is that the instructor does not do that. I guess I am spoiled from years of right=left and left=right, but this video hurts my head. She moves her right side and says move right, but of course on the TV it is to your left, so it is backwards. If you DO make the mental switch and move left when she says right, then you are in effect doing the workout backwards. I don't know how much that matters, but it makes me feel I am doing everything wrong.

7490487,5,B0176SAQIY,"This is a wonderful resource for anyone beginning to learn basic Tai Chi forms. The 24 Form was developed by the Chinese government in the 1950's as a way for the general public to quickly learn an exercise that would bring better health. The form has it's roots in traditional Yang Family tai chi martial arts . I have taught this same form for more than 20 years and will recommend this DVD to my students looking for a way to review and practice what they are learning in class.

Master Helen Liang is very clear, precise and detailed in her instruction. She is easy to understand and a joy to watch. The form is filmed in multiple directions so you can see her hands from the front and follow the flow of the form from the back. Instruction is given on how to stand properly so that there is no pressure on the back or spine, how to breathe and relax so that the lungs are fully free to function properly and there is even some insight in to how to raise the spirit and use intent of the eyes to meld with movement. My particular favorite form of instruction is to point out common mistakes that beginners make and to show how these mistakes look and ways to correct them. Master Liang uses this technique in her teachings. Stance work and stepping is an important part of any style tai chi. This DVD shows a few basic stances, Bow, Empty, T and how they are used in the form.

The staging and filming of this DVD, as with all others that I own from YMAA is excellent! They are some of the best produced in the business of martial arts instruction. Some scenes are done outside for when you want to follow along and practice with music and a natural setting. Other teaching clips are always done against a plain, clear background with great lighting and instructors wearing simple gear and having excellent posture and stances.

Tai Chi is a life long learning process and a player can learn many levels from practicing simple forms. This DVD is made for the beginner and those looking for a way to do gentle exercise, moving meditation or to just enjoy simple movement. Once you are comfortable with that, be sure to check out more advanced material from the YMAA and find the deeper meanings in the forms. Deep meditation, intense healing, self defense applications and body conditioning and strengthen methods. All can be found in tai chi if you practice long and diligently enough.",1461888000,8,2389,4.5

I've read some reviews that some seniors found it to be to advanced. First I should say, I'm in ""descent"" shape and feel that I will be able to do all of the 24 forms. (I'm on form 5 at this time from this DVD). I believe that the people rating this DVD low didn't know what they were getting themselves into. The 24 form is the 24 form, meaning there are 24 different forms to learn, and yes, standing on one foot is one of the forms. They should try the simplified ones first, like the Tai Chi for Arthritis as an example, which by the way, aren't that easy, (to do them right).  Over a couple of years, I have tried a couple different Tai Chi beginner DVD's, neither one was anywhere near as good as this one. Read any of the 5 star reviews and they say it all.

7490505,5,B0176SAQIY,"Excellent class on DVD. Not everyone has access to classes, this DVD gives the class at your home. The teacher goes through the forms outside in yard environment, then inside in a all soft-white room for perfect clarity of the movements. After a brief explanation on Tai Chi, she takes you through each form separately before moving on to the next one. She explains each step and movement like one is attending her class. She repeats the movement while being filmed from different angles, including from behind. She ends each movement with a brief demo of the movement's application for self-defense against another person, a bonus. Some of the movements that may be a problem for beginners and older folks can be slightly modified, which the teacher mentions if applicable when the movement is being discussed. Her ""physical"" class takes 24 weeks, 1 hour a week. She suggests learning each movement (or two) before learning the next one in a similarly patient manner This is not meant for those who want to be shown and then do it without an explanation of positions and placement of your ""parts"", common mistakes of same, or want instant results.

This pertains to how the 24 form was filmed (front and back views), but also to teh discussion of qigong and martial aspects of the form. No, this DVD does not teach you martial applications; but it certainly demonstrates the martial INTENT of each movement, which helps with understanding the form.
Qigong aspects are discussed in the ""Guidelines"" section (along posture and movement guidelines), which is not the section to skip, especially for beginners. It is obvious that Helen Liang possesses a wealth of knowledge on qigong and conveys it to the audience as much as possible on this non-qigong-specific DVD.

Each movement of the form is described in great detail and shown from different angles. Hand movements and stepping for each movement are introduced separately (which is super helpful for an uncoordinated person like me) and then they are combined.

7490515,4,B0176SAQIY,"As DVDs for self instruction go, this is about as good as they can get in this format, and in this amount of time (2 hours, 20 minutes). Being a tai chi student for some years now, I am more ""dry and clinical"" in my preferences for learning material, so the opening footage of Ms. Liang performing in a flowery park was not what I was after.  (For the newcomers to TCC, this may be inspiring. So I give that a by, and no problem.)
  But I should not have been worried. Nearly all of this DVD is devoted to thoroughly teaching the movements of the form - no long lectures, no promotions for other products, etc. There is a short intro segment, with some background and history. She shares a little bit of the theory. Then right onto the form.
  Her breakdown and explanations of the movements is very good, there is sufficient repetition of key points and fundamentals, and a very minimal touching on the martial applications.
Why did I not give this 5 stars? My personal prejudice. Note: This is in no way a PRACTICAL APPLICATION DVD - it is strictly for health and fitness. My concern is that some of the movements, (done merely as an exercise here, granted), seem to me to be done counter to effectively defending yourself. I feel that if one is not teaching tai chi with both the martial and therapeutic values observed (and some argue that they are actually one and the same), then the subject of martial application should not even be brought up. This could conceivably cause confusion for some students.
  The above notwithstanding, I probably could give it 4 1/2 stars - it is a fine tool for those interested in learning tai chi for health.

I bought this and tried to use Handbrake to convert it to a portable digital file, but the DVD is conversion-locked so now I'm stuck with a DVD that is massively inconvenient to use (none of my laptops have DVD players anymore - you too, right?).

Fortunately YMAA offers an app which can be ""unlocked"" for $9.99 and it contains the same materials. Note that the app is free to download, but if you don't purchase the ""unlock"" as an in-app purchase for the aforesaid $9.99, the app will be totally useless. It's not exactly a scam, they are apparently afraid if they tell you up front the app really costs $9.99, no one will buy it.

So don't do what I did and buy the DVD, then later have to buy the app anyway. Go straight to the app! (Which doesn't run on Fire tablets, btw).

In terms of content, I much prefer the Kung Fu Tai Chi magazine rendition of the 24 Form (the national standardized form) by Sifu Zou Yunjian on YouTube as uploaded by kungfumagazine dot com on May 16, 2013 (there is also a rear view by the same professor but the moves aren't as beautiful).  BUT I can't download YouTube videos and carry them around, and there is no breakdown of the separate moves to help me catch the details. There is no doubt that Helen Liang is terrific and I think this (the YMMA app or the old-tech DVD) is the best reference for the 24.

You probably can't learn the form on your own if you are new to tai chi unless you attend a class. You CAN learn if you have some prior experience. And if you are attending a class in the 24, this is a perfect supplement.",1526601600,5,1630,4.245161290322581
