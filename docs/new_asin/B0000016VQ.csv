7901931,5,B0000016VQ,"I have been watching this ballet since I was a little girl.  I have several comments about it.  First the principle dancers are of course the GREAT Nureyev who does a fabulous job as Romeo and Carla Fracci who is one of the best ballerinas of the previous generation as Juliet.  The other solo roles are cast very well.  Fonteyn is Lady Capulet and she is still draws the eye as a very regal and elegant mother.

My second point is about the choreography.  I have seen many different productions of Romeo and Juliet and this is by far the best one (not just because it is the one I saw in childhood).  In fact I also had the older version of Romeo and Juliet with Fonteyn and Nureyev in the title roles and I could never sit through the whole production.  In this production the fight scenes are very well choreographed to the music.  The most moving scene is the death of Mercutio and Tybalt.  In this scene Nureyev makes Juliet's grief the center instead of Lady Capulet as in the McMillan production.  I actually prefer this.  The love scenes between Nureyev and Fracci are highly energized and show the dynamic range of the two dancers.  And the acting and dramatization of all the players is crutial to the total production of the ballet.

This is a must see especially for Nureyev lovers.",1196899200,2,1294,4.4743589743589745

7901933,5,B0000016VQ,This time Romeo and Juliet is choreographed by Rudolf Nureyev to the Prokovfiev score.  This time it is Carla Fracci to Nureyev's Romeo. Margot Fonteyn once Juliet to Nureyev's Romeo is now the Capulet mother of Juliet. The action is very verismo and rough. But in those times life was not easy.,1134172800,2,295,4.673076923076923
7901934,3,B0000016VQ,"Mr. Maltin's review obviously refers to the film starring Leonardo di Caprio ""Romeo + Juliet"" and not to Mr. Nureyev's production of the celebrated ballet to Prokofiev's music.
This production, staged in Italy is very similar to the one mr. Nureyev staged for the Paris Opera and should not be confused with MacMillan`s version for the Royal ballet.",1003104000,6,349,5.0344827586206895
