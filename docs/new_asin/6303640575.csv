8215471,5,6303640575,I enjoyed this movie Man In Uniform. I just love Kevin Tighe that played in Emergency and had to check out this movie and also keep you guessing what was going to happen next. I would recommend this to anyone.,1315872000,,209,4.25
8215472,5,6303640575,"Tired of watching dishonest suspense? A MAN IN UNIFORM will restore your faith in the fine art of mystery.  It is an honest psycho-drama.  Why is it that Canada is able to give us good movies in B packages?  The script was excellent. The writers were faced with a problem of writing a script withing a script.  They did a banging good job.  The ""cop"" lead by Tom Mc Camus was played superbly.  Five stars for Brigitte Bako's stupendous performance.",988156800,6,448,4.5375
