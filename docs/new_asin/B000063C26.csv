8698773,5,B000063C26,"Originally ordered in January but never arrived. As a result I got a refund, purchased from another seller, and I am very satisfied with the purchase! Includes the entire first season of the series, consisting of the first 13 episodes. The bonus feature is some bumpers for the show from back when it aired on Kids Station in Japan. Make sure you can view region 2 discs before purchasing. As long as you aren't too bothered by the cartoon violence, I highly recommend!",1521244800,,469,4.662650602409639
