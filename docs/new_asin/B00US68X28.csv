I have always loved Barbara McNair and am greatful that these shows are available. I would reccommend them without hesitation.",1445817600,2,273,4.591836734693878

7070680,5,B00US68X28,"The Barbara McNair show was very well done. It's mostly music with musical guests and the occasional stand-up comic (the less said about them the better). Barbara sings the hits of the day but also some standards. For the most part the guest stars are not good but Barbara more than makes up for that. She had a very good and distinctive singing voice and should have been more famous. Barbara McNair had a unique gift and now, because of these DVDs, more people will get to experience it.",1436313600,5,489,4.50561797752809
7070681,5,B00US68X28,"Barbara McNair Box Set is wonderful. With episodes of her television variety show of the 1970's you can;t miss with this one. Guest stars include Debbie Reynolds, Della Reese, Vicki Lawrence, Johnny Mathis,Freda Payne, and many others. The singing of Barbara is sublime, and you will have a gret time enjoying these shows. Fans of Barbara McNair, and lovers of television variety shows of the 1970's will like this the most.",1433203200,2,424,4.985915492957746
7070682,5,B00US68X28,"The songs are there!  These shows appear to be UNCUT, however the run times vary from a full 49:00 to 47:45.
This syndicated Canadian produced musical variety show supposedly ran for 3 seasons, but this set has only 4 shows from season 1 & 14 shows from season 2.
Season 1 has a very intimate Night Club feeling, the audience is seated around multiple round tables with drinks as the performers entertain them on a small Night Club like stage.
Season 2 got a bigger budget as Canadian television network CTV picked up the show.  Unfortunately gone was that intimate Night Club setting, now the audience is forced to sit on what looks like incredibly uncomfortable bleacher seats.  A live band has been added to the show.
Season 3, well I have not found any information of this season existing other that the mention on the DVD case that the show ran from 1969 to 1972.

The video quality varies from show to show, lets remember that these are 1969 analogue Quadra-Plex 2"" reel to reel video tape masters.  We are very lucky that these even survive and are playable.

There is so little information about this show, I will go into detail on just what is on these discs.

It is a pleasure to get to see these RARE almost forgotten shows!

ONE COMPLAINT:  The packaging is very cheap!  A flimsy cardboard box held together by tape.  You have to cut the tape to open it and find a cardboard booklet inside with the discs inserted into cardboard sleeves.  VERY EASY TO SCRATCH THE DISCS!

7070684,5,B00US68X28,"Finally, I've waited years for this. Althrough it's not complete it's still a winner. The print is great and so is the sound.
Barbara was a dear friend and very much missed. She spent the holidays with us. She comes across sweet and beautiful.
And that  was exactly how she was. Do yourself a favor and buy this wonderful show.
