He is great with kids and at creates stories and situations that makes Bible stories come to life and the biblical principals can be applied to everyday life, even understandable to a kid.  He is very playful, spontaneous, silly and kids go nuts over his teaching style. He is a great puppeteer as well. If you want to the bible to be fun for your kids, get this DVD.",1380931200,,408,4.368421052631579
8588422,5,B005GR1G82,"Boys love trucks, girls love dolls but both love puppets and stuffed animals. If you have a child, this is the video for you because your kids will watch it over and over and not get bored.

The man, Billabong Brad, is really, really good at making his animals come alive with voices and stories that are presented on a very simple and easy to understand level. Great, positive messages. Fun illustrations.

If you are looking for something for a church resource in a children's setting, get this because you will teach as well as have something that will keep them quiet and focused. The same for a home. Why expose your kids to violence and stress when you can put this DVD on the TV and know your kids will be taught lessons that will make them happy and smiling.

I wish there were more of these but get them while you can.",1380326400,,827,4.357142857142857
