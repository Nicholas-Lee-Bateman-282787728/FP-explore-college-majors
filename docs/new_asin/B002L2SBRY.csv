8372358,1,B002L2SBRY,"Too much unnecessary dialogue, and not enough real information/ on the life-cycle of the salmon. Loud background noise. This video had the potential to be much better, but it was boring, and to wordy. sometimes the video clips did not match the content spoken. I purchased this for my students because we were studying the Chinook salmon. It was a bit of a let down.",1382918400,,366,4.6461538461538465
8372359,5,B002L2SBRY,"This is an excellent video. Very informative and interesting. Great footage of salmon and bears, eagles and other predators, as well as interviews with fisheries experts. Highly recommended! Our little boy loved it, and we enjoyed it as well.",1297123200,,242,5.230769230769231
