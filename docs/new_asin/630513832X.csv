7884390,3,630513832X,"Filmed on an obvious shoestring budget, director Fiona Cunningham Reid does the best she can with the hand with which she has been dealt. The premise of the film is simple. Steffi, a dynamic, bi-racial, lesbian ice skater, is dumped by her skating partner and lover, on practically the eve of the Gay Games same sex pairs ice skating competition for which they had been training. Steffi urgently needs a new partner, if she is to enter.
Enter shy Natalie, naive and unsure. She hasn't had a date in a long time, if ever. Living with her sister and her family, Natalie's home life is hell. Her older sister nags her and uses her as a maid and babysitter, while her brother-in-law slaps a make on her. They disparage her love of ice skating. Life is sure uncomfortable for Natalie, and skating seems to be her only solace.
Steffi and Natalie meet and beging skating together. Natalie becomes aware of her own budding sexuality, as she finds herself attracted to Steffi. They become lovers and seem ready to skate away together into the sunset, when Natalie discovers that Steffi has not been straight with her (pun intended). It looks like Steffi's dream of a gold medal at the Gay Games in New York in the same sex pairs ice skating competition is destined to remain just that. Does Natalie wake up and smell the coffee in time to skate back into Steffi's life? Watch the film and find out.",1015632000,18,1389,4.582329317269076
7884391,4,630513832X,"Despite a microscopic budget, former cinematographer and documentation  Reid has succeeded in creating an amazingly believable and angst-less  lesbian coming out story.
When black photographer and amateur skater  (Williams) loses her bed and skating partner shortly before competing in  the 1994 Gay Games competition, she begins a desperate search for a  suitable replacement. She thinks she finds one in Nathalie (Avery), a young  ""straight"" woman and skating novice.
While the two fine-tune  their technique on the ice, they also begin a romance that proves to be  just as difficult to master. A heart-warming romantic comedy on ice skates.",961891200,30,643,5.489795918367347
