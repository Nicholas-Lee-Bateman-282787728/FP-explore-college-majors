I love the last work out, it is pretty killer and that's what I wanted.",1262217600,,147,3.7419354838709675
8146110,1,B000ILYYEY,"This 5 CD workout series is garbage. Some levels are horribly basic and others are extremely taxing with no sets - just straight 2 minute repetitions. No warm ups or cool downs. The instructors themselves seem lost and uncertain on what to do next. The cardio/kick-boxing section is by far the worst and least challenging of all - the instructor keeps making coreography mistakes and repeats ''Sorry, I messed up'' over and over again.

Very low quality filming, very boring, no editing and no music. This is hands-down the worst fitness DVD I have owned.",1224288000,4,555,4.842105263157895
8146111,4,B000ILYYEY,"I like this box set because it has various types of exercises from pilates, yoga, strength training, cardio to kickboxing. It's a little low budget as it is simply people in a gym and appears to be slow and not as upbeat as other cardio workouts. However, it surprising really works you out, espeically the kickboxing one. My entire core and back were sore the next day. My only negative comment is that it didn't specify certain equipment was necessary which disappointed me as I do not have all they used in their videos. They use a medicine ball, a step and 3-5lb dumbells in various videos. I still have not done them all but personal in-home training, kickboxing and the cardio workout all are fantastic!",1178409600,7,709,4.634920634920635
8146112,5,B000ILYYEY,"I was waiting for there to be a complete workout dvd that delivers weight training, stretching, abs and cardio, and these dvd's do just that. For only $[...] you get close to 5 hours of workouts seperated on 5 discs. (There are 10 workouts in all)

Disc 1: Personal Training 1 and 2
Disc 2: Yoga 1 & 2
Disc 3: ABS Butt and thighs 1 & 2
Disc 4: Pilates 1 & 2
Disc 5: Cardio and Kickboxing

Setting: These all take place in a gym, so there aren't any beautiful oceans in the background, or some fancy studio...it's pretty simple.

Instructors: There is a different instructor for each workout, (except for pilates 1 & 2- the same person instructs both of those)and they act very normal when working out. They aren't all smiles and inspiration speeches, they pretty much just do their job- cue you decently-and that's it.

Production: The production quality is not excellent, but for the price of this collection and what you get from it, it's a pretty good deal. If you are the type of person that needs your workout dvd's to be filmed with the best equipment possible and need your instructors to be dressed in designer exercise apparel, then I don't recommend these dvd's to you.

Beginners to advanced could use these dvd's because there is a good variety of workouts in this collection ranging from easy to difficult. When I pop in one of these dvd's I feel like I am taking personalized classes at the YMCA. I recommend this set because it is an excellent buy and will satisfy all your fitness needs. Enjoy! :)",1162512000,22,1513,4.487272727272727
