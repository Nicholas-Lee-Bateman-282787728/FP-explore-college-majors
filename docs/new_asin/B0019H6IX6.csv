8274010,4,B0019H6IX6,"Blue Seed was one of my favorite anime back in the 90's. Sadly though ADV's dub and subtitle translation was patchy at best. Momiji is portrayed as a high school girl in both English dub and English subtitle. She's actually a middle school student. Also the TAC was actually called the Governmental Office of the Country. Which makes more sense if you are trying to hide a secret organization taht fights monsters from the public eye. I mean come on ADV, ""Terrestrial Administration Center""? That name so screams occult right there. The dub wasn't bad and the subtitles weren't bad either. If this ever gets re-licensed I hope to see new subtitles. This series being redone would be better.

But enough about nitpicking. Is this a show to watch? Yes it is. It's one of the few classic Japanese occult anime out there on Japanese folklore. We don't see much of that anymore. Everything is moe/cutesy type anime with bright colors and low quality stories. Blue Seed while not to series can attract A type(type who like deep story) watchers and B type(type who like moe) watchers being a classic show but having tasteful brief moments of the other stuff keep the range of audience in.",1494892800,,1181,4.733009708737864
8274011,4,B0019H6IX6,"I do not want to spoil the surprises but will tell the basics. It's a solid old style anime with very few flashy effects with some pretty nice artwork considering the age. The story revolves around a young girl who seems normal enough, but suddenly she begins getting attacked by monsters and now her hometown is overrun with monsters and mysterious overgrowths of plants that wreak havoc on her city. An ancient deity has been reborn and plans to turn all living things into plants!",1449014400,,483,4.694117647058824

8274015,5,B0019H6IX6,"Blue Seed is my favorite anime ever.  I've seen all the Hayao Miyazaki films, I've seen other anime series good and bad, and I'm a fan of Cowboy Bebop.

But Blue Seed is my favorite.  Why?  Because of the creativity of the show, loveable characters, my favorite anime heroine ever:  Momiji Fujimiya, and the fact that the last 6 episodes of the series always keep me on the edge of my seat and bring tears to my eyes.

There are other flashier shows, more famous shows.  But this one has more heart than many.  Unlike crap like Neon Genesis Evangelion, you actually care about the characters and the plot, and by the end of the series, you feel like you've been rewarded for watching all 26 episodes.  With Evangelion, you felt like you were being punished by the last 6 episodes.

Momiji Fujimiya is my favorite anime heroine, because of her selfless courage, she's not a superwoman warrior but she doesn't let that stop her, her believeable insecurities around her crush Kusanagi and she is voiced by the greatest female voice actor on Earth: Megumi Hayashibara.

The 13 omakes that come with the tv series are by and large priceless and worth watching again and again.

I wish I could say that Blue Seed Beyond was more of the same, but it wasn't.  The characters were the same and it was nice to see them in action together again.  But the plot of the first two episodes was too rushed, and the third episode had nothing to do with either the series or the first 2 episodes of Beyond aside from the characters.  It was worth getting with the rest of the series though, because of the 14th omake that was included as an extra on the Blue Seed Beyond disc.  For a Momiji and Kusanagi fan like me, it had all the heart and soul that Beyond should have had.

It pains me that this series isn't better known and appreciated.  Hopefully someday there will be a big revival of interests in this show and other works by creator Yuzo Takada.",1300060800,4,1936,4.451704545454546
8274016,4,B0019H6IX6,"The life of a teenage girl can be stressful enough, but Momiji Fujimiya is a bit more stressed than usual -- it turns out that evil plant monsters are out to get her. Yes, evil plant monsters.

Fortunately if you can swallow that, most of the rest of this series will be a pretty entertaining ride. While it starts rather shakily (and with a very patchy dub), ""Blue Seed: Complete Collection"" unwinds into a complex anime full of grotesque monsters, teen romance, blam-blam action and international strife as the whole world is threatene, et cetera et cetera. It's fluffy fun, but what sets it apart is a heavy dose of Japanese folklore. The sequel's a bit of a dud, though.

One day on the way to school, Momiji Fujimiya is confronted by two bizarre creatures -- a young man (Kusanagi) with seven ""blue seed"" mitamas embedded in his body, who tries to kill her; and a serpentine plant monster (Orochi). Turns out she's part of an ancient family line, the Kushinada, that can destroy the aragami (sort of plant monsters).

But then Orochi invades Momiji's high school to destroy her, and is barely stopped by the Terrestrial Administration Center (a motley band of scientists, soldiers and government officials). Before Momiji knows it, she's been handed over to Mr. Kunikida of the TAC, and Kusanagi has changed his mind about killing her -- now he wants to protect her, no matter what. Oh yeah, and the Kushinada before her was a twin sister named Kaede, now presumed dead.

And life with the TAC is rarely boring: they fight a bizarre jellyfish, a giant water blob, a grotesque crow, a tree aragami at an idol show (where Momiji song-duels with an American Shinto priestess), mutated dogs, a fire-breathing frog, a building-sized centipede, and a bloodsucking creature that can control people. Then a new trio of enemies appear -- a treacherous Kushinada thought to be dead, a sinister man with eight mitama, and the reborn god Susano-o. As the aragami grow in power and number, Momiji becomes plagued with doubts... and the fear that she will lose everything.

And then there's the OAV, which takes place a couple years later -- a mad scientist is creating his own brand of aragami, and assorted TAC members are having romantic woes of one kind or another (Momiji has a love rival). It's a totally extraneous story that feels like it was whipped up for a few extra bucks and some random fanservice. And it doesn't make much sense either (a bomber in a hot spring? That's it?).

""Blue Seed: Complete Collection"" starts off a little wobbly. Initially the stories are geared towards fighting the aragami-of-the-week, and a some episodes are just ridiculous -- a couple of them actually hinge on a pop idol competition and PANTY-PREDICTION software. Seriously. But the series starts to flower when it returns to the roots of Japanese folklore and legend, complete with kappa, an immortal woman, and a reborn god.

Additionally, as the story becomes more complex and darker, it also brings in an overarcing storyline that stretches all the way to the end. But the writers also keep the main storyline saturated with lighter fare, to remind us that these are people with ordinary lives to live -- a cute little romance between Momiji and Kusanagi, and some fun glimpses at how the various TAC members act around one another. And of course, plenty of explosions, gunfire and messy splattery action scenes.

In the first three episodes, Momiji is as endearing as a cat ice-skating on a blackboard -- she whines almost continuously. Fortunately she becomes a far more likable heroine as the series goes on, grappling with insecurities and worries that seem all too realistic. Kusanagi is a likable counterpart for Momiji: strong, powerful, but still relaxed enough to tease her about her underwear whenever he gets a chance. Of course he's also utterly socially inept, which makes their budding romance a bit more difficult.

And unlike many an anime show, the supporting cast is pretty colourful, even if they sometimes come across as stereotypes (the Genius Loser-Nerd, the Gung-Ho Gun Girl, the Scientist immersed in her work, etc). Fortunately each character is explored lovingly and given their own quirks and weaknesses, making them seem quite real and endearing.

It's worth noting that the English dub for this series isn't of great quality. In fact at the start of the series, it's pretty awful -- Momiji's whine, Kusanagi's toneless yells, and Matsudaira's scratchiness. Fortunately the voice actors get the hang of it a few episodes in, and they're doing a pretty decent job by the middle of the series.

""Blue Seed: Complete Collection"" starts off wobbly in many ways, but it also serves up plenty of monsters, mayhem, and Japanese folklore. Worth seeing, and actually goes from mediocre to brilliant in a short time.",1247961600,6,4824,4.8995098039215685
8274017,4,B0019H6IX6,"Blue Seed is a good series. It begins with a mysterious glow-girl talking to one of the cast members in the beganing, in which she then disappears after everyone has ran-away. Afterwards, the story begans with an ordinary school-girl name Momiji who is suddenly attacked by a gigantic 7-headed dragon inside of her school!(After she meets a mysterious young-man with a red jacket that is trying to rid of her...) She tries to escape from this treacherous beast, not knowing or understanding what it wants from her! Blue Seed has fanservice in it, so be warned of pantie-shots, wet clothes exposing the shape of momiji's chest, and her skirt being ripped by the aragami monster in the begining. Kusanagi will also refer to/lift Momiji's skirt for her panties time and time again as a joke, in which she will yell ""pervert!"" and try to slap him. Other than that this is a pretty clean anime. There are a cast of supporting characters whose personalities support the backbone of the main characters. This is a story of the sacrifice of love. How far will you go to sacrifice those who you love? Will you choose between yourself, or for others? Blue Seed ask this question, with a very interesting twist. A must see for anyone that has watched ""Slayers"" or OutLaw Star. The voice of Momiji is the popular J-Pop singer Megumi Hayashiba",1237680000,,1330,4.737068965517241
