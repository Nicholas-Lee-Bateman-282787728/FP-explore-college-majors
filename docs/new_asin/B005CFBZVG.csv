4652944,1,B005CFBZVG,"Just like the Hellraiser collection, this one also does NOT come with part 1. I don't understand why not. If you want to put together a collection, then the beginning of the series is a must. Part 1 of every movie should always be included. Its the main reason why people liked the movie to begin with. I won't buy it, if its missing the most important part.",1329350400,7,358,4.279411764705882

4652970,5,B005CFBZVG,A small town in the U.S. Midwest is investigated for a series of horrific murders and the investigators find a cult of possessed kids killing all the adults! The cult is busted up after one heck of a night! Some kids are adopted but the new parents find that the kids are not quite rehabilitated. A medical student takes on the issue of the children and is thrown into a nightmare world! Some college students go back to the town where it all began and find that the cult has restarted the mass murders. These are just some of the stories you will view in this collection. Very scary collection!,1407715200,,595,4.418181818181818
4652971,4,B005CFBZVG,It was a gift for someone who loves this type of movie. I personally don't usually pick this type of movie.  The person I purchased them for loved them.,1404000000,,152,4.241379310344827
4652972,4,B005CFBZVG,"One thing to note, the original film is not part of this collections, this only contains the first six sequels (2 more have been made since ""Revelation""), so if you pick this up looking for the Linda Hamilton film, you'll have to grad that movie on another disk.

I had bailed on this series after seeing part 2 in the theaters, but I love horror, and I love Stephen King, and at this price, I figured that even if I only found one or two films I liked, then it would be worth it. I have more thorough reviews posted under the single titles compiled here, but figured I would toss out a quick review for the collection as well.

Children of the Corn II: The Final Sacrifice - Taking up right after the events of the first film, we see what happens when a neighboring town takes in the kids who worshipped He Who Walks Behind the Rows. I didn't really care for it back in the day, but have to say I enjoyed it more with this second viewing. There is a streak of black humor that funs through this one and it's a lot of fun.

Children of the Corn III: Urban Harvest - Two brothers escape from an abusive father and are adopted by a young couple living in Chicago. The older brother begins to make friends, and starts coming out of his shell. The younger brother turns to He Who Walks Behind the Rows. I thought this one was going to be awful, but found myself really having fun with this entry. I thought the dynamic between the two brother really carried the film, and the performance were much better than expected.

Children of the Corn IV: The Gathering - A young woman (Naomi Watts) returns to the family farm to help take care of her aging mother (Karen Black). Strange events begin to grip the town after an evil spirit is released from a well. This is hands down my favorite film in this collection. While this was the first direct-to-video film in this series, you can tell the people involved wanted to do the most with the meager budget they had. Full of atmosphere and scares, and featuring two Academy Award nominated actresses, this movie is worth the price of the disk alone.

Children of the Corn V: Fields of Terror - A group of kids set out to scatter the ashes of a friends who had recently died, and get stuck in the corn with murderous kids. This one is bad, there are some fields here, but no terror. If you want to see Eva Mendes in an early role, have at it, but there is nothing here to recommend.

Children of the Corn 666: Isaac's Return - A young woman returns to Gatlin to find her biological mother, and discovers that she was the first child born of the murderous corn cult kids. Isaac, the boy preacher from the first film, has been in a coma since the original movie, and he wakes up wearing green contacts. Unfortunately, there is no menace to Isaac, at one point they show him in a bathrobe, using a walker to get around?? I liked that they brought back John Franklin from the original movie, but wish they had given him something to do.

Children of the Corn: Revelation - A young woman travels to Nebraska looking for her missing grandmother. Staying at her grandma's run-down apartment building we meet a bunch of weirdo tenants, and there are some weirdo kids handing around, and somehow this may tie back to the events of Gatlin, even though the main focus is on a tent revival that burnt to the ground?? We do finally get some killer corn stalks and this was the first film in the series to have nudity....but it's painfully dull.

For this price, this is a solid little collection, the first three films on the disk are well worth the price, and consider the other films as ""bonus"" material, if you've got nothing else to do, they make for good background noise.",1403136000,,3702,4.362844702467344
4652973,5,B005CFBZVG,some great movies they take you on trip about children each film does not have to watched in order to enjoy them because other than the fact kids do the killing there is no reference to any other film in it except for the 6th one where isac returns. the first disc is opposite the way it reads the fourth movie is on side a not b.,1400112000,,330,3.9402985074626864
4652974,4,B005CFBZVG,"ENJOYABLE AS HORROR FILMS GO.  THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE MUCH CONTINUITY BETWEEN THE MOVIES, BUT MAYBE THAT IS WHAT MAKES THEM FUN TO WATCH.  EACH ONE IS DIFFERENT.  MOVIE 2 WAS A BIT TOO CAMPY FOR MY TASTE, BUT THE REST WERE OK.",1394928000,,228,4.136363636363637
4652975,1,B005CFBZVG,"I was looking for a movie that either starred Crawford or Davis.  It was a gruesome, bloody, go no where thing.  It was a story based more on the tradition of witch craft people of the corn and their yearly festivals.  It was cleverly done with more emotional  provocations and behaviors than this one.",1388620800,,302,4.537037037037037

4652977,4,B005CFBZVG,"This is a great way to catch up with the Children of the Corn series. You get 6 of the films. You get one double-sided DVD, and one single-sided DVD. I hate double-sided DVDs. I find them terribly confusing, and its easy to ruin them by accident. I usually ""rip"" my DVDs so I can watch them in iTunes on my Macintosh computers or AppleTV.

It's a nice set, the price is right.",1384128000,3,376,4.1506849315068495
4652978,2,B005CFBZVG,"I always thought to myself I would never buy any of these past the first and the tv remake (which for a SyFy original wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.) Yet here are movies 2-7 in one set for a really low price so I figure why not, it almost finishes off a series. I've seen the first 4 or 5 movies years ago and the only thing I remember really is from the second movie, the hero and heroine go into the corn to make out and as they're rolling around in a cleaning one of them pulls a severed hand out from under them. To me that's the only memorable moment for this series.

  Some reviews on here have quoted outrage at not having the first movie in this collection. I felt the same way with the Friday the 13th collection till I realized that after Jason Takes Manhattan, Paramount sold the rights to New Line so those last 2 movies were never going to be in a box set with the others. The same is true with Children of the Corn, New Line did the original 1984 movie and Dimension took over in 1993 with Children of the Corn II The Final Sacrifice. So, chances are you will never find the complete series in one set because there were made by different companies.",1380844800,7,1173,4.11353711790393
4652979,3,B005CFBZVG,To me the story of the children of the corn is just worn out. Like the first one is great but these are simply just a repeat.,1379894400,,125,3.6666666666666665
4652980,5,B005CFBZVG,The Children Of The Corn 1 Was The Best To Me Of Course Since Its The Only One That Is Based After The Children Of The Corn Short Story Bye Stephen King.

4652991,5,B005CFBZVG,"For those of you who are looking to polish off and complete your collection..this dvd is for you. So you bought the first movie..well there are a bunch of sequels... heres a good way to get them all without crowding up your shelf space. The movies themselves are decent enough if you like those sort of movies. Though I feel after part 3 they kinda went on a tangent with the story lines and every movie seems to be a story in itself having nothing to do with the original story line other than a stray kid from the original town seems to spread the lunacy some place else. They seem like alternate reality fan fiction made into movies to me. But they aren't that bad, though some of the actors could be better. All in all for the price and the way its bundled. If you want to finish off the collection, its a great deal.",1353196800,,821,4.235668789808917

4652994,3,B005CFBZVG,"Although I have just watched the first two of the seriers, (as well as the first, not part of this series). I felt that the movies had it's moments of jumpyness, but I still felt that they were corny.

I did enjoy them, but I felt it was hilarious when the corn started to kill people. I also felt that how people died was completley unrealisitic. I mean I didn't expect it to be completely realistic obviously. But it was so unrealistic, it was almost humourus. And as well as the monster in the end. I was like, ""that's it"" I felt it looked like a really angry big booger. I laughed.

Not a fav series, at all. But so corny, it's intertaining. Fun to watch every once in a while. But not on my watch regular list",1340236800,,714,4.166666666666667
4652995,3,B005CFBZVG,"So here I am, a fan of Karen Black, who has done some pretty wacky roles (one of the reasons I like her). And she is in Children of the Corn. Imagine my surprise to find out there are 3 movies before and 3 movies after the movie she is in. I am about to forget it when I find out I can get the whole series for less than the price of one new release. Movie #1 is for whatever reason not included in this set, but I got that for $5 on eBay.

Since this is 6 movies and they all have their own detailed reviews on here, I'll be brief. Although I wonder: how did a short story end up being a movie series consisting of over 10 hours? It's usually Stephen King's incredibly long books that end up being miniseries. (One I really enjoyed was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stephen-King-s-The-Stand/dp/B003O434GG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stephen King's The Stand</a>.)

Movie #2 was good. #3 was good... until the end. That big slimy monster was just weird. They used monster technology that was just not perfected yet. And even if it had been, it didn't make much sense. Before that, the evil force had simply been that subtle wave beneath the dirt in the cornfields. Simple yet scary. Not to mention the cornstalks that can strangle people. #4 was the movie that included Karen Black. Her role was appropriately weird. #5 and #6 were OK. #7 would have been fine except... it really didn't make sense as an end to the series. There were barely any cornfields. The grandmother was supposed to be the only child worshiper of ""he who walks behind the rows"" who survived. But then, why did it not take place in the year 2050 or something? Apparently, because it explained the beginning of everything. But if all the children died off 75 years ago, then where did all the children in the first 6 movies come from? I guess what irritated me was all of the not-quite-endings in all the movies that were never tied up in the subsequent sequels. But, it does seem that it is finally over.

Overall, not a bad set. Horror is not one of my favorite genres, but as a series, it did pretty well. It probably went on too long, but many series do! It would have been better if ANY actors had continued from one movie to the next. (We finally got a repeat in movie #6.)",1335571200,11,2294,4.549636803874092
8465313,5,B005CFBZVG,A lot of suspense but to unrealistic at the same time but like science fiction so I think the unreal will come real some day! ;),1520121600,,128,3.9615384615384617
8465314,5,B005CFBZVG,"The Children of the Corn is an institution in itself. I love all of the COTC movies. Actually, 2 &3 are some of my all-time fav movies. The quality of the sequels are great and the slight change of stories to mix it up while still maintaining the original premise is good. I'm so glad that Stephen King wrote that short story in Night Shift. Otherwise, these would never be in my life.",1518912000,,385,4.287671232876712
