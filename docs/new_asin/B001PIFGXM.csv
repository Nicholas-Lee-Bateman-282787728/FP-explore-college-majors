3747261,4,B001PIFGXM,"This is not a history of the war, one would need to look elsewhere for that. But it does give what the title suggests, which is what life was like in Nazi Germany. The destruction of the German cities is thought-provoking indeed. Then the remarkable footage of Goebbels revealing his thoughts, taken from his diary. He comes across as a thoroughly dislikable person but he was a twisted genius. When Hitler hid himself away running the war, we see it was Goebbels that kept the people going with visits to the bombed cities and with stirring speeches.
Then the article on Television was an eye opener revealing how advanced the Germans were in this sphere.
Lastly, something I never knew about, were the vast underground tunnels used to keep production going despite the air raids. One of these underground complexes is still being used by the present German army!",1361664000,8,864,4.805369127516778
3747262,5,B001PIFGXM,"Unfortunately, people are so busy trying to make a living in this driven, fast paced, complex world we live in that relatively few either have the time, or take the time, to read books, anymore.  Anyone who really wants to know the truth about who is running the show should read this book . . . before it is too late.  This is an important, highly informed expose of what is really going on in our country.  You can stick your head in the sand if you want to and pretend that all is well; you can listen to and parrot the cliches of the detractors who tell you that all of the conspiracy theories"" going around are nonsense, or blatant lies: or,  you can begin to try to wake up.  If you want to wake up in order to become a responsible, thinking, informed member of the human race, using the brain you were given when you got here for something more elevated than fantasy, wishfull thinking, and watching TV . . . then start by reading this book.

3747263,5,B001PIFGXM,"A lot of footage I've never seen before. Firestorm was especially interesting, for me at least. Loved the footage taken from the bombers. Also I was not aware we had actually made such an effort to target and kill so many civilians. SO MUCH footage of the aftermath of those bombings. Definitely an eye opener, but also not aimed at attacking either side as being ""Evil"", just putting the facts out there for the viewer to make their own conclusion. All the other DVDs also had a lot of footage I've never seen. Very happy to have this in my collection.",1340582400,11,553,4.485148514851486
3747264,4,B001PIFGXM,"There are 4 DVDs in this package and the ones that contain the ""Firestorm"" documentary and the documentary on Joseph Goebbels seems to be very interesting and good. The one on Goebbels shows quite a bit of extra footage & information that helps understand better Hitler and the nazi parties rise to power. The one on the undeground tunnel system.....I don't know how much I believe the story on the underground tunnels, etc..but I guess it is something don't hear much about and altogether,,,if you can get this DVD set for around $20- $ 25 you might feel it was worth it. But again I think it is a bit over priced on Amazon. at ""$35 or more.",1339718400,6,642,4.4491525423728815
3747265,2,B001PIFGXM,"The biggest revelation contained in (or more to the point, censored from) the carefully written and edited video titled the ""Goebbles Experiment"" is the use of the film itself as a Pro-Homosex Propaganda Tool.

 While it has been clearly established that the Nazi Party was created and led by Homo-Anal Coprophile Ephebophiles such as founder Ernst Rohm and his protg Hitler, this fact as well as the purge known as the ""Night of the Long Knives"" have been completely censored from the video.

 Ernst Rohm is Never mentioned once, despite his central role in forming and leading the Nazis and their homosex terrorist Storm Troopers during their rise to power. The facts of the purge of 1934 and Goebbles thoughts on it are completely omitted and the story simply skips over those central events as if they never happened, which is good propaganda if not good historical documentary ethics.

  The use of scenes from the notorious propaganda film ""Triumph of the Will"" - without mention that its immediate predecessor 'Triumph of Faith"" (the two - by the same director Leni Riefenstahl, are eerily similar) was recalled and almost all copies destroyed - because it showed Rohm and his Protege Hitler as Equals in the party, is a serious breach of Documentary Integrity - in a film alleging to be about Nazi Propaganda.

 In propaganda trick that even Goebbles would approve of, the only mention of the Homosex Perversions that pervaded the Nazi movement is in Goebbles lamentations that he is being unfairly labeled as one of the same. This `unfair' characterization is handled deftly by the editors focus on Gobbles eventual marriage and children, which by inference discounts the facts about his boy raping comrades like Rohm and Heines.

 Brief mention is made of Goebbles unhappiness with his early work in Munich, but nothing of the conditions that led to this - despite the fact that Munich was a nexus for the pervasive endemic Homosex Ephebophilia that truly characterized the Nazis and particularly Rohm's Storm Troopers.

 Thus in the end a rather slick hollyweird documentary about a propagandist, becomes in itself Propaganda - carefully sanitizing the ugly truth of the rank perversions that made the Nazis what they were, because it suits a more modern agenda of the hollyweird homosex lobby.

 Beyond that - there are a few good quotes, particularly those about ""Change"" - which could have (and perhaps were) recycled by the next generation of fascists for the 2008 Presidential Campaign.

 I recommend that those interested in the deliberately `missing' pieces to the puzzle - read a copy of ""The Pink Swastika"" by Abrams and Lively, as well as view the History Channel documentary titled ""Night of the Long Knives"" and the first five episodes of the Military Channel documentary ""Hitler's Bodyguard.""

 Because only by augmenting the `Goebbles Experiment' with outside sources covering the Censored material - can one understand the propaganda experiment that is the video itself.",1290470400,26,2996,5.077551020408163
3747266,5,B001PIFGXM,"Excellent film footage seldom seen and then footage seen often blended together with a fresh view. Excellent narration. The focus of this series of DVDs is on topics usually explored briefly in other documentaries. This series serves to focus and then present an indepth representation.

For those interested in something more than an overview of isolated topics. The Goebbels Experiment is a narration developed from his diary. The focus on Goebbels helps in placing the Reich players in their respective hierarchial order. Notwithstanding none of this history needs repeating, the study of the Third Reich remains a confusing abomination and each perspective adds information albeit no additonal understanding of why enough never seems to be enough.",1275350400,35,751,5.474137931034483
3747267,4,B001PIFGXM,"While I was disappointed that this was not the ABC Circle Films mini series, ""Inside the Third Reich"", the story of Albert Speer's role in the third reich, I was pleasantly surpised by the four documentries that were included in the set.  I would have been even happier had it been the Rutger Hauer mini series.  I guess it pays to wait for the description before ordering.  I'll have dig out my laser discs and player and make my own dvd version, until Disney decides to issue the mini series on dvd.",1240444800,18,501,4.423913043478261

8333315,3,B001PIFGXM,"I had thought I ordered the film based on the autobiography of Albert Speer which is entitled Inside the Third Reich.  There must of  been a mix up, as I received documentaries of personalities, places and other aspects of the Third Reich.  It is such a hassle to return the product or to ask for an exchange for the right DVD, that I'll just keep it and be more careful about ordering in the future and hope I get the DVD based on Speer's autobiography the next time I order.
