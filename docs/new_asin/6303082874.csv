556718,5,6303082874,I actually purchased this for a friend who works in the golf industry.  He told me about this movie years ago and has not been able to find it.  This is a surprise for him!,1358553600,,172,3.8857142857142857
556719,5,6303082874,"I had recently read the book about the bio of BEN HOGAN. Seemed only natural I would want the movie. Amazon had it, price was good, so I bought it. Got a e-mail to confirm, and anougher saying it be shipped. About a week later, got the movie. Watched it next day, and it was really good. I am not displeased with any part of this transaction, will do so again.",1356825600,,360,4.084507042253521
556720,3,6303082874,"When I first saw this movie I was in the most intense phase of my golf obsession; I would've watched a Hogan movie if it was made with stick figures on a flip pad.  I'm guessing that most thoughtful golfers ""liked"" this movie but hungered for something more.  Hogan was a complex, fascinating character who deserved a more nuanced portrait.  Why no one has ever attempted such a movie escapes me.

The movie is pleasant enough and Glenn Ford was certainly an accomplished actor but he was the wrong choice for the Hogan role.  I don't know too much about all the actors of that day but a character actor who could convey subtleties might have created a more memorable movie.

The previous reviewer mentions the book ""Hogan"" by Curt Sampson and I also highly recommend that book if you want a deeper, more complex look at Hogan, both as a human being and as a golfer.",1284681600,2,866,4.484076433121019
556721,3,6303082874,"Being a golfer and a fan of the sport for many years, I was very interested in seeing this, which I did when the VHS first came out. Later, I saw it again because of the same reason plus I usually find Glenn Ford's films entertaining.  Also, Ben Hogan was a fascinating man and incredible golfer. The things he accomplished after nearly dying in a horrific car crash and are amazing and inspiring.

The only probleml I had with the film was showing what a nice guy he usually was, and someone cared lot about what the public thought.  That's not true; he could care less. Anyone who knew Hogan, or competed against him, will tell you that. This is like the hokey William Bendix movie on Babe Ruth.

I don't need all of Ben's faults pointed out, but went overboard in the other direction.  Even the great Hogan would tell you that. I've read where this film embarrassed him.",1147219200,3,873,4.43125
556722,4,6303082874,"I recently had the chance to see this film again after many years and once again enjoyed it possibly even more than the first time. Glenn Ford plays pro golfer, Ben Hogan and as usual with most of his films he fits the part perfectly. A reliable actor like Ford can make even a simple little film very entertaining. Anne Baxter as his wife, is too very good in her part. They have a very nice chemistry, and they are very believable as a married couple. One might notice that the prize amounts paid to the winners is very different from the millions paid today. A nice piece of nostalgia-",1128816000,2,588,4.3545454545454545
556723,5,6303082874,"This is a good biopic about golf immortal Ben Hogan, master of the repetitive swing and accurate beyond belief.  It reflects the dramatic standards of 1951, however, and you just have to know that Ben and wife Valerie CRINGED when they saw some of the onscreen exchanges between Glen Ford and Anne Baxter.
Hogan himself hit the golf shots for this film, and you can easily see how masterful he was.  The Beatles later wrote a theme song for ""Follow the Sun,"" but there was never enough demand to substantiate a re-release of the movie updated with that musical addition.",1035504000,22,570,4.69
556724,4,6303082874,"Hogan is such a mysterious man.  Ford tells an adequate job of portraying him, aloof and intense, always polite and maticulously dressed.
The coverage of the accident and rehab is great.  Thought maybe the opening of the caddie segment of his life could have been done with little more ""up close and personal touch,"" since this seemed to affect Ben so much.
Sampson's book ""Hogan"" provides a worthy reference to read along with this video.  Heard that there was to be a new attempt at Hogan's story with Kevin Kostner playing Ben.
Neat to have one narrated by Crenshaw or Kris Tschetter and those who actually knew the guy (for sure, Venturi!)  Done right, could be great!",988675200,6,672,4.717948717948718
556725,3,6303082874,"It has been many years since watching Follow the Sun. This is a motivational movie for any young golfer to watch.  It is about faith and persistance.
As a young man this picture had a major influence on my  life.  When it is available for sale again, I will be the first to buy a  copy.",947894400,18,286,4.053571428571429

556792,4,6303082874,"A wonderful movie with great performances by Glenn Ford and Anne Baxter.  It follows the career of Ben Hogan faithfully, with the fictional parts blending in nicely.  It helps of course that Hogan himself had a hand in the making of this film and I think makes it more believable.  A good gift for the film buff and golf fanatic alike.",1443312000,2,335,4.459016393442623

556896,1,6303082874,"I LOVE this movie, but I am rating this VHS tape, and what I received for my money.  As soon as I opened the package the tape rattled, while it played OK the first time when I went to rewind it, it would NOT rewind all the way to the end, at the end of the tape, it looked almost square, rather than round, I then shook it and could see where a piece of the clear reel of the tape
had chipped off and was what was rattling around inside.  I should have tried to play it as soon as I got it, but did not so now I am
stuck with it, shipping to send it back would be more than I paid for it.  Do not use this Vendor for any VCR purchases!",1413936000,,635,3.6544117647058822
556897,5,6303082874,"I bought this DVD mainly for my husband who is an avid golfer and a follower of Ben Hogan's method. I didn't know all the challenges that Ben Hogan went through. It was a well-done, well-acted movie and we both enjoyed it very much and I was so glad to find it on DVD (I've been looking for it for several years). It was well done and my husband said it did a very good job of showing Hogan's life. I know you'll enjoy it as much as we did.",1413417600,,440,3.9

556995,2,6303082874,"Entertaining and very definitely reflective of the time the movie was made - it actually looks old and, to tell you the truth, I found it a bit slow-moving. But as I understand it, Ben Hogan was a consultant so it's probably a pretty good portrait of the man. I purchased it because of the memory I had of going to see the movie with my father when I was about ten years old and him explaining the game of golf to me because I had no clue what it was all about. I don't know how I felt about it when I was ten but, looking at it through 73-year-old eyes it's more the memory I enjoy than the movie.",1409616000,,598,3.950413223140496

556999,5,6303082874,"Glenn Ford as Ben Hogan , this is his story. The legendary Ben Hogan who loved to play golf, and was a champion, only to suffer in a car accident. Near death, and requiring life saving surgery which impeded his abilty to walk and play the game he loved. Hogan endures a remarkable comeback, not only to life, and walking but playing golf again..As a champion. Definitely worth watching..",1399248000,2,387,4.6231884057971016

557001,4,6303082874,"I gave it four stars because I liked the story, but some of the story is left out.  His early childhood is amazing and should be told in another movie.  This movie is about a shy guy who becomes a very good Professional but it doesnt explain WHY.  The facts are known but not included in this movie.  The acting is good but the story doesn't go into detail.  I guess I'm one of thoses who says the book was better.  Anyone interested in Ben Hogan should read ""Ben Hogan's secret"" by Bob Thomas",1387411200,,493,4.191489361702128
