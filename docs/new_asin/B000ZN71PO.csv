8236047,4,B000ZN71PO,great way to learn signs with the whole family . my kids loved it . a little bit more signs would have been nice though .,1415059200,,121,3.6923076923076925
8236048,1,B000ZN71PO,"I'm a huge fan of the Series One Signing Times (we own and love all of them), so it's with great disappointment that I give this product a one star.  WE ALREADY LEARNED MOST OF THESE SIGNS IN SERIES ONE!  I'm furious, because these are pretty expensive.  There are so many signs that she could have taught kids in this episode; I have no clue why she would choose to just go over ones that we already paid about $20 to learn in a prior episode.

Sadly, the music in Series Two is just as disappointing -- and that's in all of the Series Two episodes that we purchased, not just this one.  You only get one unique show-related song during each episode and it's horrible.  To make matters worse, you have to listen to it over and over throughout the episode.  Then they have similarly chant-like songs to introduce these so-called ""learning modules"" that they repeat in each episode.  The learning modules really just take up time with more repeated material so that they would have to create LESS fresh material in each episode.

We made the mistake of buying five of these Series Two episodes at one time -- trusting that it would be up to their usual standards based on our experience with Series One -- and the quality of the music is abysmal in all of them.  I feel like they churned this out over a weekend of work.

Please let me reiterate that Series One is fabulous.  I have even given it five star reviews on Amazon years ago.  Rachel and her team are exceptionally talented and that is why this stuns me.",1293926400,7,1513,4.399280575539568
8236049,4,B000ZN71PO,"This video is very entertaining and children are delighted by it.
However, why would anyone buy it to find only a handful of new words?
If it was offered less than $10, okay, but this feels like a waste of money.
At this stage, if children have been through all the first series,they should sign all the words in story time and while singing. There is no decision to teach complete sentences. The first series was doing this beautifully, but now they should try to teach us how to communicate.",1292976000,,493,4.488888888888889
8236050,5,B000ZN71PO,"I have 21 month old twin daughters, and they started watching these videos with extreme excitement and interest ever since they were 9 months old.  Because of these videos and my help of course, they can sign over 60+ signs, which has definatety helped the communication barrier.  If they can't say it, they sign.  They know their colors, they can count to 10, and they know their ABC's.  I highly recommend all of the videos.  The music is fantastic, and they are just short enough with enough information to hold their interest.",1232323200,,530,4.717391304347826
8236051,3,B000ZN71PO,"I am disappointed with this, my first purchase of the Series Two DVD's.
There are more words that were already covered previously than there are new words.  The sign for rain, in this DVD is different than the sign shown earlier. Ok, so apparently there are 2 signs for rain. If you knew 2 signs for rain, would you use 1, one time and the 2nd another time?  Or would you use the one you prefer all the time?  As an instructor, wouldn't you teach both at the time that word was introduced?

This is not a logical progression from series 1.  As I stated before, more of the words shown in this DVD have already been covered with only a few new words.  Would you keep buying new, say for example, recipe books if there were only 5 new recipes and the rest were repeats from the old book, or tv show DVD's where there were more repeat episodes from the previous DVD with a few more new episodes?

There is a lot of time spent on singing and much less time showing the signs. It isn't nearly as easy to learn a sign from this format as it was from the series 1 format.

I really wanted to learn sign language enough to be able to hold a conversation. It doesn't seem possible via DVD ... yet.",1203033600,7,1188,4.157205240174672
8236052,5,B000ZN71PO,"This volume includes a collection of some signs that are available on previous volumes as well as some new signs such as 'thunder' and 'sky' and new songs putting them together in a different way.  We love the incorporation of 'Hopping Time' which gets the kids up off of the couch and 'Story Time' which introduces a bunch of new signs and vocabulary words and rhymes. We really enjoy the new concepts introduced in all of the Series 2 volumes which are more interactive and build on each new sign to put the song together. As always, the music is fresh and we don't mind watching and listening to it over and over again!",1200528000,2,622,4.456140350877193
