8568329,2,B00BGWDYNQ,"I ditto this review.  I just wish I had seen the review before I bought it.  Great concept, terrible instruction.

Very poor instruction. Tracy gives very little to no instruction. I am relatively fit and when I saw her infomercial I thought it might be the right program for me because I wanted long, lean and toned not bulk muscle which is what normally happens to me in the gym. The cardio CD which you do for 6 days a week for a half an hour I found to be pretty good but only after getting the moves down or at least anticipate the next moves because there are no instructions, meaning she dances around not explaining how to do the moves you just try to copy her moves but this took about 5 to 6 days just to become familiar with it.

In conjunction with the cardio, you do a workout program for another half hour six days a week. The workout program changes every 10 days. The first 1-10days took me a bit of time to get the exercises down especially the arm portion because once again she does not explain the exercises you just copy her moves so at first the whole program is frustrating but at least the first 10 days of the workout was at a moderate pace so I was able to keep up with her after a while and around day 6 I felt ok, I can do this program.

Lets move on to the start of day 11. I was excited to put in the new workout program because yes, I started seeing results especially with the cardio but just like the first workout program there are no instructions, no count (at the beginning of the cardio she does mention that MOST moves will be either 2, 4 or 8 counts) there are no counts though when the actual work out programs are in progress so you have to try and keep count yourself so you can do the same count on the other leg/arm etc. Anyway back to day 11, I pop in the CD and low and behold more of the same 'no instruction', just copy her but not only that, it's in double time and if you have seen her arm workouts, they are not 'normal' workouts, you are moving your arms at different angles up, down, back forth... ARE YOU KIDDING ME???? OMG it would have taken me the whole 10days of this program just to get familiar with the moves. At first I found myself not wanting to quit the program so I watched a bit, rewind, watched, rewind and watched again to try and keep up but this was just not working and made me even more frustrated. All this to say, the program is now back in the box from where it came and I am back in the gym lol. The cardio I will continue to do since I have gotten familiar with it and it never changed. So, if you are not in good shape or are just starting out, this program is not for you because it will take you double time of the program duration just to learn the moves. If you are in excellent shape, this program is not for you because it will probably take you just as long to learn the moves lol. If Tracy Anderson is your physical personal trainer or you are Tracy, this program is for you. If more instructional thought was put into this it might have been a good product for me.",1392768000,,3052,4.088480801335559
8568330,2,B00BGWDYNQ,"Buyer beware - if you have had any knee problems, I would not recommend buying this product. I didn't even have knees problems before, and now I do from the Transform dvd Days 1-10. You have to put all of your weight on one or the other of your kneecaps for about 15 mins. straight and it's painful! Eight days into the 90 day program, I could barely even walk for almost two weeks after, let alone do my regular workout. Also, the dance cardio dvd is intense. I'm in pretty good shape but even I know it would take me probably six months to be able to complete it. And furthermore, the diet plan, although it sounds ""great"" to want to eat a pure ""liquid diet"" for every other week for 3 months, that's something that's just not practical for my lifestyle or health. And so when I wanted to return this DVD set, Amazon of course wouldn't let me because I had already opened it, surprise, surprise. I had liked Tracy's mat workout DVD but this one will have to go in the ""when I feel crazy over-anxious to over work myself"" kind of category... kind of a waste!",1385337600,5,1059,4.27363184079602
8568331,5,B00BGWDYNQ,"A lot of people are complaining about Tracy's program because it has no cueing and it in small part is silly dance moves that's of no benefit, and probably too because the lower body toning is done on the knees and lacks stretching afterward.

But here's what people are not mentioning: The fact that this program strengthens the body like magic. That is, if you're doing it everyday for six days a week as instructed. For instance, on day one I was like: Aw man, what have you gotten yourself into now? And I was very sore everywhere, but it was that soreness that made me determined to stick with it because as an experienced exerciser I know that effective workouts makes the muscles sore at first.

And then on day two, I felt the intensity of the soreness easing down and I was able to do like 50% of the reps without rest, whereas I hardly pulled off 30% the day before. Then on day three, the pain was almost gone, and I pulled off 60% of the reps. On Day four, the pain was completely history, it was like it never happened, and I was able to pull off 80% of the reps without rest, and then by day nine, I could do 100% of the reps with just a few seconds of rest! So I went from a flat out weakling to remarkably stronger in just nine days! And lost an inch off my butt and thighs!

But what about day 10? Okay, I admit that I didn't do it. Don't ask me why because I don't know. The best I can tell you is that I'm a screw up. And skipping a day made me feel guilty, but I felt strong enough to forget about it and move on to 11-20, and I pulled off about 80% of that off without rest. It's a lot tougher than the 1-10.

Now look, I screwed up again and skipped 5 days in a row. Now please, don't ask me why because I don't know. But all I know is that I can't blame it on Tracy. I've been a screw up with exercise before she was born. But I got a grip and pulled myself together, and I'm back on the ball. I'm making up those skipped five days, made up 3 with just 2 to go. So let me tell you that skipping a day is not worth it, it's only a 30 minute workout so do yourself a favor and do it and get it over with. You'll be so glad that you did. Don't be the epic screw up that I've been.

Okay, and now for the complaints about Tracey's aerobic portion:

I agree with those and don't do it, because I found myself concentrating more on following her moves than getting the exercise, which was very annoying. But any aerobics will do because it's the body toning that delivers the results, the aerobics helps to burn calories so you can loose weight. Tracy loves to dance and effective aerobics doesn't have to be her fetish for dancing. I do a 30 minute jog on my treadmill with a great treadmill DVD I found on Collage Video called Runerval 1.0, everybody with a treadmill should grab a copy of it. It has a group of runners including a big lady who looks over 400lbs, but she's jogging! And it has a coach who tells you when to run, slow it down, and walk. And it has an on screen counter. It's a super cool workout for treadmills, and I'm jogging now. I can't believe that! And I'm crediting Tracy's program for it, for the strength I've built from it in just the first few days.

Or I'll do Debra Mazda's Let's Get Stepping, a 20 minute spin on my elliptical or a 30 minute spin on my stationary bike. Or I'll do something else like Leslie Sansone's walk, Kathy Smith's low impact, etc. I have a vast assortment of workouts, so I do whatever I feel up to on that day.

Okay, and now for the knee part: If your knees are jacked up like mine, you can still do this program. Just get you a nice thick knee cushion. Here's the one I got from Amazon:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/YogaAccessories-TM-Supportive-Rectangular-Bolster/dp/B002RC39ZW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">YogaAccessories TM Supportive Rectangular Bolster</a>

I highly recommend this program for the toning portion that's ironclad guaranteed to strengthen you up like crazy. For that alone it's worth the money, and I'm planning to do either Glute or Hip Centric after Omni is finished, because I've never experienced anything like this, not since Joanie Greggains. Remember Joanie? Tracy reminds me a lot of her, but she's like Joanie to the nines! And I still got Joanie's old stuff, so if I want to do high impact aerobics Joanie's old school stuff is more doable than Tracy's.

And if you're morbidly obese, over 200lbs, you can still do this! But you may need to modify some of the moves in 11-20 which is what I'm doing now. You'll still feel the burn! Believe me!

I look at this way: We all want to get in shape and feel great and want to do it is quickly as possible, we don't want to be exercising for an hour or longer on one workout. Those eon workouts are playing out. Even Shaun T came up with a 25 minute version of his Insanity. We want it shorter and more effective now. So grab this program and DO THE 30 MINUTES EVERYDAY. Do it as early in the day as possible, and then decide on what you want to do for aerobics. Or if you like Mexican jumping bean hopping, then Tracy's aerobics will suit you.

Metamorphosis is the best 30 minute total body exercise I've ever seen.

Now look,

If you won't do 30 minutes of effective work a day, then I don't want to hear you.

You need to be lined up against a wall and shot! Tee Hee.. Just kidding.

Oh and I almost forgot, about Tracy's diet plan:

Some people feel that it's dangerous but it's not. It's stringent but not extensive beyond one week at a time. The first week is drastic in calorie reduction but come on, a week won't kill you. It's more of a body detox, with the removal of excess salts, etc. Now I can't follow it to the letter because of the expense of the daily fresh ingredients, being that I live on a fixed income and the time I started it was at the same time I needed to buy a new Mac system, so I'm wiped out at the moment and can only eat some of the items. And I found that the recipes are really cool. I can eat it. Like with the tuna mixed with mustard and celery and cauliflower. I couldn't do the fresh cauliflower today but I never had tuna with mustard before, never even heard of it, but it's pretty good. I can eat it and enjoy it wrapped in lettuce.

And her recipes shows some great things to do with apples and other fruits. So I'm trying some of the recipes out and finding that this diet is certainly doable. I consider my weight watcher turkey chili recipe to be better than her beef chili recipe, but all in all, I like her diet plan and giving it a test run. Pretty soon I'll ease into it full force.

One thing I can tell you about weight loss from experience is that muscle building plays a key role in burning fat. This is a scientific fact. Muscle building naturally tames the appetite. I found that after a vigorous weight training session, that I can't over eat after that. I simply can't pull that off, and my body starts burning fat immediately after. So with some stretch band work and this Omnicentric program you can naturally reduce your appetite to stick to Tracy's diet plan without appetite suppressants. Diet pills is a very bad idea for your body and your wallet. It's only a good idea for the doctor collecting your fee for the pills. Stretch some bands and kill your tapeworm the natural way. In fact, a jog on the treadmill will kill your tapeworm.",1383523200,20,7394,4.295046661880833
