7894482,3,6305608245,"Gabriella is taking a shower and the camera captures her full nudity. She is spectacularly and enjoys sex. However, catching her true husband in sex, she runs away blaming herself for inexperience. Finding a guitar guy on the road, they make love in a motel. Then she learns about the chance to earn big money stripping. Lots of frontal nudity. During her first strip solo, a full-figured Asian lady gives her a $$$ offer just for
dancing at a guy's mansion.  As she is dancing nude, the lady is devoring
the guy. Then the two ladies touch each other and the lesbos begins.
Returning the next night, she is invited to stay. But he plays it cool,
giving her a full body massage with warm sensual oils. Of course she
repays him in kind. After some sharing, she asks him to love her.
They get intertwined. Gabriella has awakenend to the joys of sex and is
fully satisfied.  The plot isn't. There is a lot of female nudity
although not male. Gabriella is lucious. If you want some fun, perhaps
with a lover, this is a good film. Enjoy yourselves afterward.  I saw it on a VHS copy which was very vivid.  Good too is you are lonely & hot.",1216252800,,1133,4.380952380952381
7894483,3,6305608245,"Gabriella (Susan Featherly) is an innocent, naive, young girl living a simple country life with... ah, forget it! She's stupid white trash! She catches her husband cheating on her, so she leaves for LA. She picks up a hitchhiker and has sex with him. When she gets to LA, she becomes a stripper. This catches the attention of some rich guy. She ditches the hitchiker and goes to live with the rich guy where she achieves her lifelong dream of being a trophy wife. Ten years from now Gabriella will REALLY be awakened when her sugar daddy dumps her for another 20-something bimbo.

Unfortunately, the pain I endured watching this was not adequetely offset with hot sex scenes. There are seven sex scenes, two strip scenes, a nude massage scene, and a non-sex girl/girl bath scene. Five of the sex scenes are boy/girl and two are girl/girl. Only four of the sex scenes were decent. Two of them went by too quickly, and the other one consisted almost entirely of the girl's head bouncing up and down on my television screen. The only memorable one was the lesbian scene between Susan and Jeannie Millar.

The women are all beautiful. In addition to Susan and Jeannie, there is also Taimie Hannum and two other women that I didn't recognize. But what's the point of beautiful women if the director just wastes them?

This wasn't a total bomb, but could have been much better. Do I recommend this? I think it all comes down to how badly you want to see Jeannie Millar, since she's super hot, but not in much stuff. If that isn't important to you, look elsewhere.",1108080000,14,1557,4.593525179856115
7894484,3,6305608245,"This is a late-night, softcore erotic drama, similar to stuff being shown on Showtime or Cinemax.  There are quite a few skin scenes here, with a few girl-girl scenes that get a little steamy, but end relatively quickly.
Most erotic movies of this type tend to have maybe 2 or 3 major love scenes, but this one has about 8 or 9 scenes total, some as short as 2 minutes, others as long as 5 minutes.  Nothing raunchy, but some scenes do fall into the ""unrated"" category.
The story is relatively boring and uninteresting, about a smalltown girl who visits the big city for the first time, but the beautiful lead actress, Susan Featherly, who is on the cover, reminds me of an Americanized version of supermodel Elle MacPherson and simply captures my attention.
The DVD itself is a barebones DVD, with just a chapter selection menu.  The video transfer is pretty clean, but the colors are a bit dull. There are no subtitles or captions, just a 2-channel stereo sound signal.
In comparison to regular movies, this is a weak unoriginal movie. However, in comparison to other late-night softcore erotica, this is actually one of the better ones I've run across, as most everything is done with taste.",1020124800,15,1194,4.70334928229665
7894485,4,6305608245,"I've kind of become a fan of these Playboy/Image Entertainment films. The girls are always achingly hot, and generally the acting and the plot is acceptable. This film may be one of the best of the bunch. In it, you have  a gorgeous girl-turned-dancer-turned-voyeur-turned lesbian. What more do  you need? The two girls in the lead roles are exceedingly gorgeous. I do  think it could have pushed the envelope abit more--especially the scenes  with the women. Too often the action in these scenes seems forced, and  scripted. Just once I'd like to see two women really getting into it  (without the XXX rating). Worth a look. Good couples viewing.",954288000,6,647,4.889908256880734

Throw this one in the machine and get busy!  -OR- Your girl want to try to get turned on by video... watch it together...for LOADS of fun!  Don't get me  wrong...there's no story line worth following but you don't buy movies like  this for the story line....do you!",952560000,,311,4.5
