Benigni is like an Italian Jerry Lewis, with English subtitles, or dubbing. Many of the sight-gags are pretty good.

706389,5,6303614280,"Incredibly funny movie, perhaps one of  Benigni's all time best films.  It's mistaken identity plot provides hilarious scenes that had us literally falling out of our chairs with laughter.  As one reviewer on IMDB put it it is like kind of a mixture of  Charlie Chaplin, Rowan Atkinson (Mr. Bean),  Buster Keaton, Woody Allen, at their best.

Not only does Benigni play both the goofy innocent but also the ruthless Mafioso boss, but he also directed and co-wrote the screenplay. This movies is a masterpiece of comedy even for those us who do not know Italian and have to make do with subtitles.

Why this doesn't seem to be available for the American market I have no clue but then again why can't I get a copy of Yellow Submarine.
I'm a big fan of Roberto Benigni, I don't know if that says something about me or not, but who cares, I find him to be a cross between Chaplin and Keaton only with sound and in colour.
His role as a taxi driver in Night on Earth is still one of my favourite movie moments.

706547,5,6303614280,This movie is typical Benigni.  He is without a doubt the Charlie Chaplin of Italian movies.  His ability to squeeze a laugh out of thin air is the thing of legends.  This 'mistaken identity' movie is funny and has all the pratfalls and laughs that you will be able to handle for an evening.

I never thought that I could laugh so hard at a movie that was subtitled (I don't speak Italian), but this is the single funniest movie I have ever seen. When you read the lines and you hear Roberto Begnini's inflection - it works.

The only reason I own a VHS machine anymore is because of this movie. When are they gonna release this on disk?",1271894400,2,375,4.267605633802817

706551,3,6303614280,"Roberto Benigni, who went to achieve international stardom with ""Life Is Beautiful,"" plays two roles in this comedy. The story is about an innocent man who is dead ringer for a gangster-informant-in hiding. Benigni plays both roles.

It's a decent movie, a low-key comedy that has some funny moments but would have been much better had it been chopped down about 15 minutes. It tends to drag a bit during the second half. Benigni, as the ""wimp,"" is a very charming guy and one that's easy to root for, but the rest of the characters in the film are just so-so. It's odd to see the usually high-strung Benigni as a lower-key person, but I like it.

Surprisingly, this is an ""R"" rated comedy, and that's because of the language. I rented this once, but would see it again on a Region 1 DVD.",1235865600,3,788,4.465277777777778

706553,5,6303614280,"Jim Carrey has nothing on Roberto Benigni. As an actor whose facial expressions and body language speak volumes, Benigni is a riot. This story of Dante (Benigni) posing as a mob boss all the while unbeknownst to him is hysterical. Dante is sweet and naive which has the audience in love with him in minutes. The film possesses a good story to go along with the comedic elements. You really must see this.",1173657600,2,404,4.5479452054794525

706555,5,6303614280,"This is a wonderful comedy from the actor of ""Life is Beautiful.""

I could sit here and write about what happened in the film and try to explain why it was hilarious, but the truth is that it's something that simply needs to be experienced, you can't be told about it. All I can tell you, the movie watching public, to do is to see this movie in the original italian with subtitles. It is true that even if you don't understand italian, you need to hear Roberto's voice for it to work. Never get a dubbed copy of ANY of his films. The dubbing is always crap. He is the funniest man alive and this film showcases the best and the most purest version of his comedy of any of his work. It's over the top, yes, but it's splendid good fun and it'll put a smile on your face for hours after.",1083974400,21,809,4.0625

706611,5,6303614280,"Before Roberto Benigni's ""Life Is Beautiful"" Oscar triumph, his movies were slapstick-style vehicles suited to the man's style of physical comedy.  You see muted shades of that style in ""Life Is Beautiful,"" but it's in full force in the excellent comedy ""Johnny Stecchino.""
The mistaken identity plotline is a staple of many of Benigni's films.  Here, he carries on as unsuspecting bus driver, Dante, and duplicitous Mafioso, Johnny 'Toothpick.'  As usual, Benigni is great at both roles.  You know immediately - through mannerisms and body language - whether it's Dante or Johnny on the screen.
Benigni's wife and frequent co-star Nicoletta Braschi is excellent as well as the Don's plotting wife.  Braschi is her usual luminous, beautiful self.
The third star is the city and outskirts of Palermo, Sicily, where most of the action takes place.  It's depicted by director Benigni as stark and deserted.  Like a city under seige. It's the perfect backdrop to this funny, engaging tale.",1063756800,,985,5.1572327044025155
706612,5,6303614280,"I watch this movie EVERYTIME it comes on cable even though I have it on video. The police station scene, the opera house scene, the cardinal and the coke, and my husband's favorite ""Scusate, ma si po sapere chi michieva deve fare il tacchino, eh?"" Mi fa schiantare da ridere. This is wet yourself funny.

YOU MUST SEE THIS MOVIE, then learn italian, THEN SEE IT AGAIN!",1059955200,3,368,4.492537313432836
706613,5,6303614280,"I can't recall if there is a more talented physical comedian than Roberto Begnini. He is gifted with comedic looks, the lean body, the child-like mannerism, and mostly, he has what it takes to make people laugh. The only person who, in my opinion, comes close and that is ""Barney Fife""

The English subtitles are very easy to read and keep up with. Note: Don't ever see English voice dubbing of his movies. You have to HEAR his own voice!

The premise of the some of his movies is a case of misidentity and yes, although that humor is not new to comedy, Benigni brings that freshness to American audiences.

Begnini plays a dual role, Dante, a meek school bus driver and gangster Johnny Stecchino. His real-life wife, Nicoletta Braschi, joins her husband again. The meek and mild Dante is mistaken by townspeople for the gangster Johnny Stecchino. It isn't difficult to distinguish between the meek Begnini and the gangster Begnini. He clearly plays each role with precision.

The dialogue is well scripted and the plot is equally entertaining. The story moves on quickly and never is there a dull moment.

I go to a boarding school, so I had quizes to study for, papers to write, delayed English books to catch up on. So I was reluctant...but it was a good thing I gave in, because I love this movie!
Today's comedies rely on slapstick humor that is neither intelliegent nor amusing. The flatulent anti-hero slips on a banana peel, the canned laughter sounds, and it's all over. But here Benigni's gift lay: his humor may be slapsticky and physical, but it's SMART. That's whatmakes it funny: the humorous bits are intricate and well-planned, which marks it as different in the world of cinema,
Benigni's movie is hilarious, fun, and extremely worthwhile. Just trust me- buy it, and you won't be sorry!",1041033600,3,785,4.614285714285714

Well, it's not terrible, in fact, it is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen, and the fact that some of the schtick is kind of cliched didn't matter, Benigni is a comic genius, and I highly anticpate his Pinocchio!",1037836800,3,493,4.2

I saw this for the first time with my cousin in Italy and apart from her intoxicating and contagious laughter that I'm sure contributed to the effect, I was in tears and laughed so much my face hurt. having watched the film countless times and even memorised much of its dialogue (In Italian it's even funnier given the variety of accents and untranslatable jokes.  I find the secens with 'Lo Zio' the uncle and the insurance fraud inspector the funniest.  I can'r stop eminding my friends that sicily has 3 plagues and that the Mafia does not even enter the picture.  I also like to shake my arm about after I get hurt in front of someone to generate fellings of guilkt and comapassion.  But the scene that really had me was 'La Cena di Bobby' that is Bobby's (the dog) dinner, complete with mayonnaise.  The humor is universal but it reflects the Italian love and tendency to defy authority at all costs.  Therefore the banana scenes, the insurance fraud resonate very well with Italians; in so doing he also echoes the best moments of Chaplin films.  I think Stecchino is superior to Life is Beautiful - which i think was made with an oscar of sympathy in mind - as it its global reach was unplanned.  There are other Benigni films like that, but only in italian. I'm thinking of an exceelnet Non ci Resta che Piangere with the eqully comical and sadly missed Massimo Troisi.  Don'e be fooled by Begigni's deliberate clowning around in American venues; he's quite genial.  In irtaly he's famous for giving a very funny interpretation of the Divine Comedy by Dante and sevarl other comic adaptations of classics.  He also takes risks and anyone who witnessed his thesaurus list for the feminine intimate parts on Italian national TV Live with the frumpy Raffaella Carra' will understand.
And now it's time to play The Minister's Wife who's presently cooking some fried Sicilian Bananas.  hopefully she won't require all that Colombian medicine for her diabetes!",1007164800,,2137,4.774456521739131
706702,5,6303614280,"A must buy!  This was very entertaining - my Italian parents were hysterical!  This and Benigni's other movie ""The Montster"" are a must for your collection!",980640000,2,156,4.961538461538462
706703,5,6303614280,"Benigni is so extremely funny that uncontrollable laughter is a serious  possibility, when watching his movies. Johnny Stecchino is also  educational. For starters, I learned a new game, ""the cabinet  minister's wife."" To think I spent so many hours learning and playing  chess! Also, there were some good tips from Benigni: ""the healthiest  fruit is the one you don't have to pay for."" And of course, I learned  to be very, very careful with bananas, while on a visit to  Palermo.
Almost every minute of the movie is funny. The scene where  Benigni is trying to convince the cardinal to take ""medicine"" and  the scene in the opera are the most hilarious things I have ever seen.  Somehow, the movie also manages to deliver a moral message. And so the  beautiful Maria (Santa Cleopatra!) who brings Dante to Palermo with a full  intention to have him murdered redeems herself by making her difficult  moral choice.",961718400,8,914,4.819354838709677
706704,5,6303614280,"Who cares about reviews? Roberto Benigni warms my heart and makes me laugh!  I would rate Johnny Stecchino as highly as  Life Is Beautiful,although it falls into the light comedy category. The chemistry  and interaction between Roberto Benigni and Nicolleta Braschi is touching  and genuine. I highly recommend this film to Benigni  fans.",953424000,2,338,5.30188679245283
706705,5,6303614280,"This is a wonderful light comedy!  The characters are likeable, the situations hilarious if not believable. Benigni is a cross between Charlie Chaplin and Peter Sellers.  Enjoy!",952214400,3,177,5.518518518518518
706766,5,6303614280,Roberto Begnini as Johnny Stecchino couldn't have been better!  He really knows how to capture his audience.  The movie made tons of laughs for my Italian class and myself.  We all enjoyed it greatly!,948844800,2,200,4.823529411764706
706767,5,6303614280,"This was the first Italian movie I have ever seen and now I haunt the video stores for more of Roberto Benigni's movies! My husband, who is from Italy, loved this movie even more than I did! The ability of Roberto  Benigni to convey so much in just an expression or a glance is very  impressive. I am hoping that his recent success in this country with  ""Life is Beautiful"" (which I plan to buy as soon as it is  available), will bring more Italian movies to this country.",934675200,4,472,4.269662921348314
706768,5,6303614280,"See it. If not for the Italian backdrop, then for the opera scence. I had to watch that scene three times beacuseI was laughing so hard. ""Sante Cleopatra""!!!",925344000,,157,4.642857142857143
706769,5,6303614280,"or come from an italian family with all the baggage that comes along with that...however, the mere idea that so much could happen to one person and him just 'not getting' it is incredibly hilarious.",923011200,,198,4.685714285714286
706770,5,6303614280,"This film is really quite a gem. Benigni's comic genius off-set by Nicoletta Braschi's demure charm is the film's centrepoint, and is the stiches that hold the unbelievable yet cliche' plot together. The comedy is  surprisingly international; non-Italians agree that it is incredibly  hilarious. Also *highly* recommended: Il Mostro (The Monster) and La vita  e' bella (Life Is Beautiful).",918864000,,389,5.559322033898305
706771,5,6303614280,"Benigni's ""Dante"" is always on the outside looking in, yet believes he is at the center of, and manipulating, everything. This perspective gives the comedy a glorious wobble from beginning to end. A  classic physical comic, Benigni is reminiscent of Chaplin or Keaton. As  with many of Benigni's portrayals, just beneath the surface of this  character is a sad and lonely soul, pathetic and vulnerable, yet full of  life, dreams and self-confidence. Blundering from one misperception to the  next, determined to be dignified at all costs, he can barely keep up with  unfolding events. His best - and only friend and confidant, is Lillo, one  of the kids on the school bus Dante drives. Seeing himself as a man of the  world, Dante's infatuation with the scheming Maria takes him to Sicily,  where he is in his element as the unwitting dupe in her plot. Benigni's  dual role as the gangster, ""Johnny"", is brilliantly played. The  film is loaded with unforgettable lines and gags. It is easy to understand  why this film was so popular in Italy, where people can laugh and cry and  laugh again in the same sentence. This is one of those rare films which can  be watched many times and each viewing will reveal new facets of comedy,  psychology and human nature. While the story may not be new, this may be  the classic interpretation. Totally enjoyable!",918864000,3,1351,4.783549783549783
