Presented without commercial interruption, this is JEFFERSON PILOT TELEPRODUCTIONS' complete telecast of the November 10, 1984, Maryland@Miami(Florida) football game. Pregame, halftime, and postgame are not included in this production. Actually, the dvd starts with the opening kickoff and ends with the teams coming onto the field at the game's conclusion. A very abrupt beginning and ending. The picture quality is excellent. Keep in mind though, this game is from 1984. Excellent carries a different perspective today than it did back then.
Classic game. Excellent quality. Own this.",1490227200,,675,5.627450980392157
