5413672,5,B00AENNHOE,"I looked up yesterday at my AA in-flight movie and saw that they were screening 'Robot & Frank.'  I immediately began buttonholing my seatmates: ""This is a really good movie."" I had the good fortune of catching it during its August 2012 big screen debut and thoroughly enjoyed it.

We sought it out for two reasons.  First, my wife and I love Frank Langella.  [Pro tip: Check out the vastly underrated&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Starting-Out-In-The-Evening/dp/B0019ZO7OU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Starting Out In The Evening</a>.]

Second, I'd caught Mr. Langella talking most informatively about the film - and about his career on stage and screen - in an interview with Fresh Air's Dave Davies.  The best part: when asked why he chose to participate in the film, Langella told a fascinating story about getting sent the script, liking it, but feeling it didn't fully depict the challenges facing a man in his eighth decade.  He said that he asked for a meeting with director Jake Schreier and writer Christopher D. Ford (both 30-ish) so he could tell them ""what [my seventies] feels like.""  Armed with that knowledge, they retooled the script to his liking and he took the role.

The supporting casting is as good as Langella.  I like James Marsden in everything he does.  He and Liv Tyler make a very believable brother-sister pair.  They could be real-life siblings...and imagining them as the offspring of Langella isn't a stretch either.  I can't delve any further into their on-screen parentage without ruining the movie's last-reel reveal.  It's well worth 89 minutes of your day spending time with this family.

One final word: seen, but not heard, is Peter Sarsgaard, voice of Langella's servant/robot.  He's not just reading words: he inhabits that robot.  It's a brilliant vocal performance.",1355529600,69,1852,5.3310344827586205
5413673,5,B00AENNHOE,"This movie is the perfect blend of comedy, drama and suspense. The acting is spot on and the pacing, energy and flow makes it so easy and fun to watch. Buy this film and share it with a friend, it's the best i've seen all year.",1355270400,11,227,3.9565217391304346
5413674,4,B00AENNHOE,"I saw the movie ""Robot & Frank"" in the theatre here in Cincinnati in early September. It's taken quite a long time for the DVD release to get listed on Amazon, but here we are finally.

""Robot & Frank"" (2012 release, 89 min.) brings the story, set in upstate NY ""in the near future"" of Frank (played by Frank Langella) who is an ex-con (a ""cat burglar"" as Frank puts it) in the latter stage of his life when his memory fails him at times. Living alone has become a challenge and one day Frank's son buys him a robot who can be a do-it-all butler for Frank. Then a strange thing happens: after initially resisting the robot as much as possible, Frank discovers he actually likes the robot's help and, even more important, its companionship. Soon thereafter, Frank concots a plan to commit one last heist, with the help of the robot. At that point we are not even half-way into the movie, and to reveal more would certainly ruin your viewing experience. You'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: (i) the movie is a strange mix of a bitter-sweet family drama, character study, buddy movie, and comedy (of course not all at the same time), but the movie finds its own pace and somehow it all works; as a result, and knowing the general premise of the movie going in, I couldn't wait to see what would happen and how it would all end; (ii) speaking of the end of the movie, it came as quite the surprise, and certainly too abrupt for my liking; (iii) this is another great, great performance from Frank Langella, who seems to be getting better with age; (iv) on the contrary, most of the supporting cast, in particular Liv Tayler, felt forced, the one exception being Susan Sarandon as the local librarian. If you are in the mood for something a bit deeper and more personal and human than the latest Avengers or Dark Knight Rises, I would recommend this in a heartbeat. In fact, I'd classify this as just ""another little movie that could"". The movie ""Robot & Frank"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1354752000,29,2020,4.486413043478261

5413711,5,B00AENNHOE,"Frank, a retired cat burglar, has two grown kids who are concerned he can no longer live alone. They are tempted to place him in a nursing home until Franks son chooses a different option: against the old mans wishes, he buys Frank a walking, talking humanoid robot programmed to improve his physical and mental health. What we get is, initially, Frank rebelling against the robot even though at times he realizes that his mental health is going downhill. He finds common ground with the robot and plays his crusty old man part to the hilt. He is from a bygone time. The chemistry between the Robot and Frank is charming and inevitable. This is a slow paced movie that you need to be patient to watch it grow, and grow it will. Frank Langella, James Marsden as his son and Susan Sarandon as the librarian ore all spectacular.  I fell in love with the Robot too.",1476489600,4,861,4.484076433121019

Frank is an elderly gentleman who is losing his memory.  His children live far away and can't really give him the help he needs.  Frank is also rebelling against losing his place in the family hierarchy as head of the family, and resists doing as he is told.  When his son gets him a robot ""butler"", Frank is outraged.  However, Frank has a very interesting past that he has all but left behind...until now.  You will love this film.  Its a little slow, but worth every minute.",1476057600,3,602,4.418181818181818

5413743,4,B00AENNHOE,"Who knows what the future holds?  Picture your ailing parent is living with dementia, you have a busy life and you do not want to have your parent live in a rehab or nursing home, so what would you do?  This scenery is the story of Robot & Frank.  Frank (played by Frank Langella) previously lived the life of a burglar but one day his ex-wife (played by Susan Sarandon), son (played by James Marsden) and daughter (played by Liv Tyler) saw that his behavior began to seem bizarre and unusual.  Instead of having Frank live in a traditional nursing environment his son decides to try something more futuristic and non-traditional, have a robot, be Frank's companion and to help Frank live a normal life as best as possible.

I find that this is a great idea in having robots possibly help our elderly or the sick, however, this scenery will displace many people and begin to tap into their cost of living; causing the crippling economic effect.  While this idea is great due to our lives being so busy which causes us the inability to pay more attention and time with our aging parents there has to be some sort of solution to give our parents the help, comfort, and companionship that they need and desire.  Maybe that calls for us to stop, take the time to be there as much as we can and forego some of our own needs remember they sacrificed for us.",1456531200,,1351,4.445344129554656

The supporting cast is just as wonderful, if under-utilized--with the exception of the first-billed ""Robot"".  This film is a terrific story taking place in the near-future, showcasing technology believably based on current robotics research specifically as used within this film.  Ironically, robotics and artificial intelligence researchers are hoping that these ""companions"" WILL be able to learn and transcend their initial programming--as depicted in the film, though I suspect they would NOT be pleased with the direction this particular robot takes.  In this aspect, the film ably enters the realm of science fiction, but make no mistake, this is a film about humanity, and human frailty.

to see a heart warming comedy that is a bit dialogue based and plenty situation based

An excellent ensemble cast movie with much good acting. Very slow moving.  If you can accept the pacing, perhaps by enjoying the acting; the several endings will reward your patience.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Frank Lengella plays Frank an aging, early stage Alzheimer victim. He is also a convicted ""second story man"", divorced and almost estranged from his two adult kids. His life has become center around a near flirtation with the town librarian Jennifer (Susan Sarandon) and his occasional shop lifting of small animal shaped bars of soap.

His son, Hunter ( James Marsdon) will force into reclusive dad's home a Robot. This is the near future when such robots commonly serve as helpers. This one is a medical helper. Its job is to help Frank find an interest and regular habits. Any ideas for what might energize the failing mind of a burglar?  For a hint, Robot is very handy at jimmying locked doors and forcing safe combinations.

Frank Lengella has been a favorite of mine going back to a long ago Public broadcasting Dracula miniseries. This performance is in every respect better. His gentle chemistry with Susan Sarandon is beautiful. The rest of the cast works together seamlessly; from the too ultra-hip and not really that cool Jake (Jeremy Strong) to the wise from the beginning Sheriff (Jeremy Sisto). The feel of a small town world slightly in the future is maintained.

This is a movie about an older person; a slow moving old person. The pacing has been set to uphold this model. Everything will happen in its time- Too slow an in too much time. The movie is less than 90 minutes, but it feels needlessly heavy and too deliberately paced. There is some lovely, dark humor. Some lovely unspoken sly commentaries about people and causes we know. Some of this makes it hard to be sure what the movie is about.  If you've the patience, and get to the real end, all, including what this movie is about will be revealed.",1417132800,3,1986,4.8753709198813056

5413882,4,B00AENNHOE,"The movie is very enjoyable, entertaining and often, very touching. It covered several areas--some are eternally humane and some are futuristic. It shows us a future world where we see quite a few lives affected by non-human companionship. In many ways, some of us are already having non-human companionship. Facebook interfaces, other social networks' and chat boards' application softwares are so advanced now that we can hardly differentiate a person behind the monitor or an AI based system on the motherboard. The movie also shows generations' separation--inevitable as technology and pace of life push us randomly, scatter us away from our closed ones and we still try to find and maintain bonds. In the end, the movie leaves you with nostalgia about family and loving connections that we all seek, but just don't do enough to find what we seek so much.",1414713600,,859,5.056338028169014

5413888,5,B00AENNHOE,"I don't say this very often when reviewing a movie, but when I do say it, I mean it- just watch Robot and Frank. Watch it without reading any reviews, and even without reading the plot synopsis. Ive had this movie in my queue for over a year, and I just watched it the other night, out of the blue, not even remembering what it was about. This is one of the sweetest, most touching movies Ive seen in years, and its sure to put you in a better mood after watching it. If you know anyone with Alzheimers, or anyone who has suffered a stroke, you know how difficult it can be to be around someone who doesnt remember you, or is asking you about things that happened 10 years ago as if its the present. Robot and Frank handles this without getting too heavy handed, and manages to be charming at the same time.

Set in the not-too-distant future, Frank is an elderly man with Alzheimers who lives by himself. He has a daughter and a son, with the former traveling for her job and the latter coming to visit once a week to make sure hes doing ok. The thing is, he isn't doing that well. Frank keeps trying to visit his favorite restaurant, which closed a long time ago, and shoplifts soap from a bath/beauty shop. He doesnt even recognize his kids when they call, and it takes a few minutes before he realizes who hes talking to. The age they're living in has a lot of advanced technology that were on the road to- video phone calls pop up on the tv when you answer, phones are essentially pieces of glass that display everything, and the biggest advancement is that robots are becoming a common sight, as they help humans with their tasks. Franks son sees that he isn't doing well, and gets him a robot to help out around the house. At first, Frank doesnt want anything to do with it, unhappy with how the robot tries to get him to eat better and makes suggestions that would be a big benefit to his health. But when Frank shoplifts soap one day, and puts it back before hes caught, he discovers that the robot took it back for him once they get home. Frank sees that the robot doesnt really abide by our laws, and has a plan. Oh, did I mention that Frank was a big time jewel thief in his early years?

I loved everything about this movie. Setting it in a future that you can believe seems like it might have been hard to do, but they pull it off, keeping things very close to the time we live in, only showing select advanced technology that you could see becoming normal 10 years from now. The cast is very small, with Frank and the robot getting the majority of the screen time, followed by the always lovely Susan Sarandon (hey, I won't argue with her showing up in any movie). Everyone does a great job with their roles, and Frank Langella is convincing in his portrayal of an Alzheimers patient. My great grandfather had Alzheimers, and this is exactly how I remembered him acting (save the burglary). Franks a lovable character, and I never wanted anything bad to happen to him. Sure, hes a jewelry thief, yet when you see how uppity his first target in years is, you cant help but want him to succeed. Sentimental moments really got me, especially one near the very end, as well as certain conversations he had with the robot. The robot emphasizes several times that he isn't a person, and that if needed, his memory can be cleared. Frank is very uncomfortable with this idea, and the moments of silence after the robot mentions this are all you need to let Franks reaction set in. Again, nothing here is forced, and no moment is drawn-out. The movies an hour and a half, and it goes by very quickly.

Theres nothing bad I can say about Robot and Frank. Its touching, funny, moves along at a good pace, has great performances, and even had me wondering how the heck things were going to resolve a couple of times given the messes Frank gets himself into. This is one Im going to be buying just so I can let other people borrow it.",1413504000,,3936,4.330623306233062

5413915,4,B00AENNHOE,"Who says movies set in the future have to be bleak, dystopian killjoys? Robot & Frank is the antithesis of those films, an unconventional and quirky crowd-pleaser of a buddy comedy that makes some heavy points without being heavy handed.

It helps that Frank Langella is in the lead as Frank, a grumpy and tired old man slowly wasting away on his own in an otherwise empty house. His wife left him thirty years ago, and Frank only has the bare minimum of contact with his two kids(James Marsden and Liv Tyler), who are on totally opposite ends of the political divide regarding human/robot relations. In this case, it's Frank's son who buys him a new robot out of concern for his worsening memory loss. Frank's daughter disagrees, but since she's traveling the world on some sort of humanitarian mission she's hardly in a position to argue.

A Luddite of epic proportions, Frank despises Robot from the moment its powered on. He swears the ""death machine"" will murder him in his sleep, and argues with it over his Captain Crunch breakfasts and lack of motivation. Frank welcomes his freedom, his long walks to the library to visit with Jennifer(Susan Sarandon), the librarian who watches over the increasingly marginalized books as they are replaced by a digitized ""library experience"". Frank watches the world changing around him, one of the old guard left behind in evolution's wake, and he doesn't like it one bit.

It's one thing to watch the world leave him behind, but Frank won't stand for it in his home as Robot cooks, cleans, and looks out for his general well-being. None of this pleases him, not the attempted hobbies to keep Frank's mind occupied, not even the lavish meals Robot prepares. It's not until Frank discovers that his mechanized pal could be the perfect accomplice to commit a little grand theft that he starts to warm up. At the height of his career, Frank was a cat burglar of some renown, and he sees Robot as a chance to get back into the game and strike back at the society he feels has gotten too smug for its own good.

Thus begins the strangest heist movie ever as cranky old Frank and Robot painstakingly case their eventual targets, with the old guy finding a new twinkle in his at the thought of his latest caper, along the way forging a bond with the Robot that would have been previously unimaginable. Christopher D. Ford's script juggles some weighty issues, like Frank's worsening Alzheimer's and spotty parenting skills, with humorous banter between the old guy and his Robot companion, making for a delightful sci-fi take on The Odd Couple. Ford, who based the film on his his student short film, has something to say about our continuing reliance on technology and how it softens us in a way most don't quite grasp, but he never lets the message become a burden on what is generally an easy going charmer of a film. Jake Schreier's direction lacks a noticeable fingerprint, but is serviceable for such a low wattage indie.

Langella is the key, however, and he's so good it'll be a crime if he's not at the top of the list for Best Actor, even at this early stage of the year. Langella has been so good for so long that he's become someone we take for granted. With a movie as strong as this, Langella is virtually untouchable, capable of saying more with a simple look than most can with their entire bodies. He makes Frank's budding friendship with Robot utterly believable every step of the way. Langella ups his game even further when opposite Sarandon, and the two have an ease about them that comes only with experience. Peter Sarsgaard voices Robot, imbuing him with just enough humanity to make you wonder if perhaps there's more going on in those circuits than meets the eye.

Sony Pictures may have made the steal of the year by picking up the rights to the film after it proved to be one of Sundance's biggest successes. They might just have a hit on their hands, the type that should make a lot of noise come this awards season.",1407974400,,3983,4.63456090651558

I suppose the point, was that the robot, who was more human than the man, was finally able to reach him through friendship, and instill some compassion and morality in him.

The part that I liked about the DVD, was that it portrays a reality, that is not very in the future, where robots are helpmates for children, the elderly and infirm. They make good companions for people that need friendship and companionship.

His adult son decides he needs a robot in-home helper, who Langella quickly co-opts into being his assistant in crime.  Many of the situations and secondary characters are painted with a too broad brush, but Langella--like Clint Eastwood and a few others, keeps you going with his crusty old man shtick.",1399593600,,414,4.9
5413966,3,B00AENNHOE,The movie was ok.  I thought it was going to be funny.  It was funny in some parts of the movie.,1399507200,,96,3.5238095238095237

5413970,4,B00AENNHOE,Excellent acting. Interesting and unusual (in a good way) story. The only reason I knocked off one star is because the movie is a bit slow and could have been 15-20mn shorter.,1398643200,,175,4.5

5413974,5,B00AENNHOE,"I've always liked Frank Langella. He has proven himself to be an actor's actor. He started out as a handsome young man and he's still going strong playing an older man with a memory problem. He and the robot helper make a cute pair and Frank proves his reasoning and memory are all intact as he inveigles his robot to help him carry out a job he plans. There's a bit of sadness in his memory problem with his ex-wife, but there is also a sweetness. I could see a sequel to this if one were ever made.",1398038400,,500,4.112244897959184

And what an interesting concept to have a robot care-giver! He shows more patience and compassion than his own children. Not a really bad movie but the writing was poor at times. The ending was not what I would have expected considering the earlier expressions of disapproval of the father by his son; a little hard to believe, not consistent, but convenient for the story teller. They must have really wanted a happy ending!",1397433600,,545,4.571428571428571
5413976,5,B00AENNHOE,I would recommend this to everyone.  This movie was nominated for Best First Screenplay by the Independent Film Service.  Frank Langella was great as was the person inside the robot.  Susan Sarandon helped make the film very watchable.  Very entertaining and deserving of five stars,1397347200,,282,5.2

5413986,4,B00AENNHOE,"This movie has a little of everything ...humor, warmth, mystery, sadness.  Not a movie for kids! We enjoyed it and it is a movie I would watch again.  Frank does a great job being a jerk but also showing other sides of himself, like vulnerability, confusion, tenderness - he's a fine actor. And the cast is good too with several other well known figures.  If you're on the fence about watching it, just do it. It's 100 minutes of delightful.",1396137600,,441,4.4875

5413994,4,B00AENNHOE,"I like Science Fiction and I am a sucker for any film about robots.  Based on the trailer I thought this would be a cute story about an old man and a robot having some kind of relationship.  When I watched it I found that the robot is a bit different than any robot I have seen in other films and books.  Robot seems to have some latitude in how he interprets its prime mission, and some wiggle room in how it assists the human in remaining interested in life.  As the story progresses you begin to see that there is a much deeper and much more touching human drama being played out.  By the end, I was very emotionally moved in a way that surprised me.  Watch this and see if you do as well.",1395705600,,692,4.051470588235294

Frank, played by Frank Longello, who proudly proclaims himself a retired cat burgler, has a fondness for books and likes to visit the library and the lovely librarian, Jennifer, played by Susan Sarandon. Frank's son, Hunter, played by James Marsdne, is concerned about his father living alone and brings him a robot to help around the house.

Frank is very resentful of the robot until he makes a discovery which changes everything, a way in which the robot can be very helpful in the implementation of some of Frank's plans. The movie is entertaing and well done.",1395705600,2,864,4.640522875816994

5414083,4,B00AENNHOE,"In the hands of another director, ""Robot and Frank"" might be a hilarious caper about a retired crook looking for one last score and his unwitting robot accomplice.  But the reality is that this tidy little film has much more important things to worry about: aging, death, and the little indignities that happen with each lost memory.

Frank Weld (Frank Langella) is slowly losing his mind.  He also happens to be an ex-con with a criminal past and a propensity for breaking and entering -- the film begins with him breaking into a home, only to realize that it's his own.  That one scene perfectly sums up Frank's dilemma as a man whose only hobby is a crime that he can no longer remember.

Frank's son and daughter Madison (Liv Tyler) have taken this road with him many times and are now so tired of the routine that they have little time for him anymore.  His son Hunter (James Marsden) gives him a robot companion (Peter Sarsgaard).  It is never given a name.  It walks like the Honda ASIMO, but -- as fitting its near-future setting -- is more advanced, capable of everything from gardening to picking locks.  It's the latter skill that finally charms Frank and gets him to accept the robot, an artificial intelligence that amorally sees any activity Frank enjoys as critical to his rehabilitation.

Back to that comic caper. Frank discovers his favorite local library is being replaced by yuppie jerk Jake (Jeremy Strong) more interested in converting documents to digital than reading books, and the symbolic struggle between the physical and the electronic centers on an antique copy of Don Quixote.  There's even a maiden in the tale, pretty librarian Jennifer (Susan Sarandon). And so, accompanied by his dutiful companion, our errant knight jousts at windmills for his fair lady.

But the truth is much more prosaic. Frank's reality unravels slowly at first, and then snowballs into a series of lies he's told himself and his children, betrayed by his own faulty memory of who he was and who he hoped he would be.

This is a deceptively complex film that offers no easy answers, even if its ending is a little trite.",1389916800,,2127,4.747282608695652

This movie is much more than I expected. The description is correct and you really don't need to know a lot more than that.

This is not a face paced movie. No big action sequences nor great robbery scenes. In fact, robbery takes a back seat in this movie. This movie is about relationships, especially friendship.

An exceptional and moving performance by Frank Langella.

First, this character really felt like he had a past, present, and future beyond the limited details in the script.  Second, I will definitely want to watch it multiple times down the road to notice details I will have forgotten or never even noticed in the first place.  There is a genuine warmth between this confused retiree and his clever robot that develops naturally and credibly.

It's usually billed as 'science fiction', and while there are some aspects of a near future scenario in it, it's really a story about people and the nature of identity. The tone is a lot closer to The Straight Story than to Enders Game or anything that you would look for if you felt like a sci-fi flick..
For my money, this is the best screenplay of 2013, and Frank's little adventure is a parable to pick the lock of what it is to be human.",1389744000,2,483,4.148936170212766

5414091,3,B00AENNHOE,"I discovered this movie purely by chance while browsing Amazon one day, and being a rather stupidly big robot fan I decided to give it a look.  It looked like it had the potential for a lot of cuteness and humor by the premise alone, and even if I had to suspend my disbelief a bit to accommodate for such an advanced robot wandering around the movie I figured it would be worth it.  I was rather surprised to see that this movie had quite a few big names for being an indie movie (or at least names that were big at one time), but I've seen some very good indie movies over the years and figured that this one would be worth a shot.

I wish I'd read some of the reviews for this before diving in.  Because while it's a touching story and is indeed humorous in places, it wasn't what I was expecting.  And I think advertising it as a comedy on the back cover is rather misleading.

Frank (Frank Langella) is a retired cat burglar who lives alone -- divorced, bitter, cantankerous, and his memory slowly degrading with time.  While his activist daughter (Liv Tyler) worries about his welfare from a distance, his son (James Marsden) gets tired of having to check up on him all the time and gets him a robot assistant.  At first Frank resents his new robot companion, and resists all its efforts to improve his life and get him healthy and active.  But when he discovers his mechanical companion has a knack for thievery, he decides to make good use of its talents, and soon he and the robot are planning and executing heists together, especially targeting a yuppie tech-head with plans to revamp the local library.  His schemes end up getting the two of them into trouble, however... and his burgeoning relationship with the local librarian further complicates things...

I really wanted to like this movie.  It does have humorous moments, the robot is quite likable, and the acting is generally strong.  The sci-fi elements in the film, such as the robot assistants and the telecommunications screens, feel a bit out of place (there's sort of an '80s vibe to the rest of the setting), but they're nothing outlandish compared to today's technology, and I was willing to accept them as part of the story.  And it's a thoughtful, if heartbreaking, look at dementia and how it impacts families.

But... again, I feel like I came into this movie expecting something different than I got.  The back of the DVD suggests a comedy, and while the film has its humorous moments, the rest of it can come across as sad, even bleak.  Frank is so bitter and cantankerous it can be hard to like him, and his son's bitter disdain toward him makes him even more unlikable.  The daughter is a generic activist sort who has little impact on the movie, the town librarian is a bland character, and the tech-head who's the target of one of Frank's heists is a one-note character who seems to have been written as unsympathetic solely so this movie can have a villain.  When the most likable character in the movie is the robot -- and not even a sentient one like in ""Short Circuit"" or ""WALL-E"" -- you know you're in trouble.

There's also a sudden twist that comes along in the last ten minutes of the movie that feels incredibly jarring to me.  I won't spoil it, but suffice it to say that it came on rather suddenly, seemingly without foreshadowing, and far too late in the movie to have any real impact on the story.  Perhaps I was simply oblivious and didn't see the foreshadowing, but still, the twist felt like a weird gimmick instead of something genuinely affecting.

The ending for this film is also somewhat depressing, a bleak note in what was trying to be an uplifting story.  Again, I won't spoil any more than I already have, but it certainly won't leave many people with warm fuzzies.

I guess a lot of the problem is me -- I went into this movie expecting something different than I got.  But still, the back of the case had me expecting something funny and cute, and I got something depressing instead.  I'd recommend it if you want something thoughtful and honest rather than comforting and heartwarming, but if you're looking for a cute movie about a robot companion, go for ""Short Circuit"" instead.",1389657600,,4196,4.545212765957447
5414092,3,B00AENNHOE,"Robot and Frank is a sweet story of age and friendship. Although it's a little slow, and doesn't have a great score, it's very endearing.

5414094,4,B00AENNHOE,"When it comes to robot or android in the even lazier future, morality is an over-rated issue. Can a robot learn and tell what's right and what's wrong? The answer is definitely No because their creator humans are incapable of telling right from wrong. How can human program robots with a moral standard? It's intriguing that the robot answer Frank when being questioned if he will betray - ""I'm programed to build trust."" What is trust? I think a better word is ""to obey"". That robot is pretty much a baby, and a baby does what we teach. Teaching makes culture to live on, even what the culture is really teaching the virtue of anti-culture, i.e., anti-establishment. That is the irony of this human culture.

On a bright note, to social (even with a robot), keep using mind (even on stealing), and garden while Frank likes to watch can slow down Alzheimer. That is a no-brainer.",1389484800,,879,4.634615384615385

His son, gets him a robot to look after him, see that he eats, clean the place up, etc. The kicker is that Frank is a retired thief, second-story man who resists the robot's help until he discovers the robot's ability to learn and retain everything, so Frank cons the robot in restarting his robbery career.

When Frank's son sees that his father is suffering from mild dementia and can no longer take care of himself, he wants to put him in a nursing home for his own safety. However, the old man vehemently refuses so his son gives him an ultimatum - nursing home or helper robot. Frank chooses the helper robot as the lesser of the two evils. The interplay between the aging thief/jailbird/second-story man and the helper robot is just delightful, starting with an antagonistic man and a, shall we say, stubborn humanoid/robot, and evolving to what could only be called a partnership that segues into a friendship of sorts.

In my view, it's more interesting to think about how technological evolution might create positive possibilities. Almost unique in contemporary cinema, here is a sly piece of early-career, almost tongue in cheek film-making, that recaptures the feel of the 50s, without talking down to us, preaching to us, or losing a contemporary feel. And these young filmmakers, not that long out of film school, somehow managed to score Frank Langella, Susan Sarandon, Peter Sarsgaard, Liv Tyler and more. And a robot that is not evil.

The acting, locales, script, direction, and premise of this film are just grande. And there is a totally brilliant twist centered on the librarian and Frank that was just magnificent.

Every actor in this film was superlative except for the VASTLY over-rated, Susan Sarandon who brought NOTHing to the role of the librarian.

Also, the advertised ""dancer Rachel Ma"" brought COMPLETE ZERO to the characterization of ""Robot."" I mean she stank. stunk, stinked---a girl in a robot costume walking. Also the robot costume was an abortion; I can just see some ""genius"" saying, ""Make it look like a refrigerator."" It was pathetic.

5414171,4,B00AENNHOE,"' Robot & Frank' is a film of quiet understanding and under statements. Frank, played by Frank Langella,is a retired burglar and lives by himself in upstate New York. He seems to have some form of dementia, but just how much is a secret from us all. His son comes to visit once a week to clean up and bring groceries. During the week Frank walks to and fro to the library for books. He keeps in touch with his family via FaceTime on his big TV. His son needs more time with his family, so he brings Frank a robot who cleans and cooks and looks after Frank. Much resistance from Frank at first, but soon they are a pair. The robot keeps him on a low sodium diet and plans activities, like a garden and walking in the woods. An idyllic existence, until Frank decides to go back to his old profession.

I have to say I will be first in line for this robot, cleaning and cooking, wow! The robot has to remind Frank that he is a robot with no feelings, programmed to help out. That said, a relationship of sorts seems to develop. Frank visits the library often, and limes the librarian a great deal. Now, that relationship is weird. You will see what I mean.

Frank fools us in many ways, crafty fella that he is. Frank seems pretty much together many times, but then he forgets easily. A remarkable bit of acting by Frank Langella. This film is really a fun and emotional film. I enjoyed it, but it seemed far fetched to me in many ways. However, an entertaining film and well acted.

Recommended. 11-22-13",1385078400,,1502,4.30035335689046
5414172,4,B00AENNHOE,"This modestly budgeted, limited release caught me by surprise. I had little expectation going in so it turned out to be a touching yet fun time.

Here's the scoop. Set in the future, Frank (Frank Langella) is an aging cat burglar living in upper state New York. His mind is going so his son (James Marsden) buys him a robot to take care of him. Frank soon realizes he can use the robot to help him pull off jobs. This leads to some interesting revelations.

This has a good plot where the old is balanced with the new. Frank is an incessant reader and borrows books from the local library regularly. But the library will quit loaning books because they are converting all to computer files. He's attracted to the librarian (Susan Sarandon), another book lover, but is having a hard time making the connection. Then there's the robot. Most son'e would have hired a human caretaker. He's unwavering in his duty to make certain Frank eats right and does things that will help him live longer and happier. Franks hates him right off the bat but, as the robot is with him 24/7 Frank cannot help but build a relationship with him. He might not want to but it builds slowly over a long period of time.

I like the setting. Upper state New York is pretty. There's a lot of green and rain so it has a good look to it. The actors must have wanted to do this project because the reported budget was $2,500,000. Langella, Sarandon, Marsden, Liv Tyler and Jeremy Sisto could easily have eaten that much up by themselves in a bigger project. The music score, written and performed by Francis and the lights, also had a nice ring to it. It sounds vaguely futuristic but not conspicuously so. This is also something I liked. Yes. It is set in the future but things looks as they do today with only a few robots and odd looking cars tipping things off. This is not the future of ""Minority Report.""

There were a few things in the script I simply didn't believe, but overall this is a fine and touching film.",1384992000,2,1990,4.4289617486338795

This movie hit very close to home subject wise, but kept it light so as to stay within the comedy genre.

5414185,4,B00AENNHOE,"Frank Langella is amazing in ""Robot & Frank,"" a well-made indie film set in near future, about a 70-year-old senior citizen Frank, who has grown forgetful and disorganized. His concerned son Hunter (James Marsden) purchases a humanoid-type robot (that looks a bit like Asimo) to take care of his father living alone. Frank, at first offended, reluctantly starts living with this unnamed ""robot helper.""

To his surprise, life with a caretaker robot turned out not so bad. Frank gets better and more energetic because, well, Frank, a former jewelry thief, finds himself a new partner.

Liv Tyler plays Frank's daughter Madison. Susan Sarandon is Jennifer, a librarian Frank is attracted to. Peter Sarsgaard provides a voice for the robot.

Like any great sci-fi work, the seemingly simple story of ""Robot & Frank"" makes us ask some intriguing questions, in this case questions about aging. Without revealing much about the story, the concept of memories plays an important role in this bitter-sweet tale. To make the film more effective, perhaps director Jake Schreier and writer Christopher D. Ford could have focused more on Susan Sarandon's character.

The idea of robots designed to make the elderly's life happier is nothing new in real life. A robotic seal ""Paro"" is a good example. What makes ""Robot & Frank"" special is the brilliant performance from Frank Langella, who makes his character convincing and touching.",1378252800,,1421,5.165217391304348

This movie was well written, by someone who's interested in asking meaningful questions about human relationships and the role of technology in our society.

5414210,4,B00AENNHOE,"This is a low budget film, the core part of the plot isn't affected by the lack of budget but you couldn't help thinking, especially when Frank left the house (assuming he's the sort of person who simply rejects change so doesn't have any mod cons at home) that in a future where the existence of the robot that was so high functioning, especially with mobility (the old guy lives in a house with stairs) was somewhat implausible when the rest of the world hasn't changed at all (in fact the cars, shops and everything seem a little dated, especially the library (I know it's more of a functioning museum but still, libraries haven't been like that for quite a few decades, certainly not in my lifetime).  The robot itself is simple, yet plausible.  It's obviously a short person in a suit but I did buy that it was indeed a robot when watching the film.

The movie revolves around the relationship between an elderly man who probably has Alzheimer's or Dementia or something like this who doesn't really want to accept or believe his condition, and his adult children. They want to do what's best for him but simply don't know what to do being he won't let them move him to a nursing home.  So his children are constantly worried about his safety and welfare and the only solution the son can come up with is to buy him an expensive care Robot (which he tells his father is a butler).  The robot knows his medical history and monitors his current state. It follows him everywhere in the house and out of it and also pesters him to eat right and to do things for his own good that the elderly man doesn't want to.  It also cleans the house, makes meals, phone calls and does daily task things.  Frank doesn't like the existence of the robot in his life, so therefore doesn't like it.  However eventually it becomes somewhat of a comfort companion wise, and when it steals something he had ditched when accused of shoplifting (something he does every time he goes into town) as it didn't understand the concept of theft, Frank knows the robot may be quite useful and convinces it a more productive hobby for his mind would be to plan a heist.

5414215,4,B00AENNHOE,"Frank Langella is an actor whose talents are rarely noted it seems. Some folks don't even know who you're talking about when his name is mentioned and that's a shame. Those of us old enough to remember will think of him as Dracula. A younger generation might consider him Nixon. The thing is he's been around turning out great performances for years and doesn't get the recognition that he deserves. His latest out on DVD proves that.

In ROBOT & FRANK Langella stars as Frank, an ex-jewel thief in the near future when things are changing as they always do. A cantankerous sort, Frank has been left by his kids to fend for himself away from family. They still try to make his life as comfortable as possible but at the same time have little to do with him. Case in point is the new item Frank's son Hunter (James Marsden) has brought to him.

To make sure that he's taken care of Hunter has just purchased a robot to be Frank's companion and caretaker. The robot has numerous responses programmed inside of him but at the same time develops his own somewhat personality the more time he spends with his new owner. At the same time he has a moral compass installed that makes him unlikely to be a partner should Frank ever decide to return to his old profession. At first confrontational Frank eventually accepts the little guy and they become friends of sort.

Frank spends his days doing little but he does enjoy the walks he takes into town especially to the local library. This partly involves his respect for the books on hand there but more to do with the local librarian Jennifer (Susan Sarandon) he takes a liking to. That will soon change as the young generation is dispensing the library of all its books to be replaced by computerized editions on hand and available at work stations. These people are interested in Frank only because he actually read a book.

Angry at the way things in his life are going and angrier still at the elitists' attitudes of this new generation, Frank decides to steal Jennifer's favorite book from the library to give to her. He recruits the robot to be his wing man. This will be no easy task as he not only has to teach the robot how to become a thief but has to convince him it's for the better as well.

Frank uses the robot to help him co-ordinate things in his goal of returning to a life of crime. They begin by taking on a small project of stealing something from the snobby head of the group determined to change the library. As Frank teaches the robot the finer skills involved in timing, lock picking and breaking and entering we're given a humorous look as he corrupts the robot that has no clue. At the same time we witness the human connection between the two that Frank doesn't share with his kids.

Problems arise when Frank's daughter Madison (Liv Tyler) arrives. Where Frank at one time wanted his daughter to be there now he wants her out so he and the robot can get back to business. But Madison is here after being plagued with guilt for not taking care of her father. Then again she also returns because it is convenient. Until she is gone Frank can't move forward with his plans.

What makes this film so interesting is the skill shown by Langella as Frank, a man who is lost in a new world that doesn't seem to have time for him any more. He does regret parts of his past, mostly the fact that he wasn't there for his children when they were growing up which is being reciprocated by their not being there for him now. It's not a matter of no love, just anger at the past. But the true emotion seen in the film isn't between one human and another but between Frank and the robot. A defining moment between the two comes towards the end but I won't ruin the surprise of it here. Watch and see.

The quality of the production values in this film are well accomplished and all involved turn in true to character performances. The photography is well done and the direction brings the most out of each actor as well as the completely unemotional robot. If you're getting older (like me) then you'll relate to many of the scenes here. This is an enjoyable film that only gets better as it moves forward.",1372118400,14,4163,4.4255874673629245

Well, I'm fortunate that I didn't wait that long to see this one.

This reminds me of my grandmother who suffered from alzheimer's and didn't even recognize me any more. We need this technology now, because like Frank, my grandmother benefited from having a routine and interaction from others. She resisted being sent to an institution until ultimately no one on the family or an aid could keep her sane at her home.

I really liked the dialog and the setup for the scenery. The shocker and pivotal point for me was the Librarian's role in Frank's life.

5414243,5,B00AENNHOE,"The trailers for this film give a decent sense of what it's about -- a retired cat burglar trains the domestic robot given to him by his son to assist in a series of crimes. There's much humor in this, and the film quickly crosses the boundaries of several genres. It's a heist film, a buddy film, a family drama, and the story a crotchety old person finding his place in a new age. However I had not expected from the trailer that more than anything else, this is a film about dementia. How does Frank deal with his gradual loss of memory, the denial and the coping mechanisms?

And just days before my father died, he had a moment when he could see it, too.

Frank (Langella) is showing signs of dementia but refuses managed care even at the insistence of his two grown children (James Marsden and Liv Tyler) neither of whom live nearby.  Hunter (Marsden) provides Frank with a robot (voiced by Peter Sarsgaard) that is never named.  Frank reluctantly agrees.  Soon he realizes that the robot can help him revive his career.  The two become friends.  Frank's only other friend is the town librarian, Jennifer (Susan Sarandon).

Director Jake Schreier and writer Christopher D. Ford provide an honest look at aging that is light enough to not get bogged down in sentimentality.  The relationship between Frank and the robot is never quite human, but the ability to exchange ideas and converse create a bond different than with a pet.

I am sure the other reviewers have mentioned the story and plot so I won't go into too much detail with my review.  This movie didn't hold my husbands interest, but he does not like independent films, so that wasn't surprising.

5414271,4,B00AENNHOE,"From former film school students at the New York University Tisch School of Arts, director Jake Schreier and writer Christopher D. Ford have said to each other that they would work on a project.  And  in 2008, the two would collaborate for the  film ""Robot & Frank"", the winner of the Alfred P. Sloan Prize at Sundance 2010.

Inspired by a story from Japan about caretaker robots being produced in Japan and the rapid development of technology, Schreir had started the story for ""Bob & Frank"" as far back as 2000.  In order to make the technology work for the film, the two would work with the company Alterian for the use of an actual robot for the film and smartphones and tables for the future were design by Tumblr's Justin Ouellette.

With only 20 days to shoot and 2.5 million dollars for the budget, the film received positive reviews from film critics and now ""Robot & Frank"" will be released on DVD courtesy of Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.

VIDEO, AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Robot & Frank"" is presented in 2:40:1 anamorphic widescreen and audio is presented in English, Portuguese and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  Picture quality is good, while most of the film is shot indoors. Lighting is well-done and no low level noise is seen, which is good.  But overall picture quality for the film is good, no major artifacts or visual problems during my viewing.  Dialogue is clear and understandable.  The main soundtrack is center and front-channel driven which is appropriate for this type of film. For the most part, video and audio are very good as one can expect on DVD.

Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French, Portuguese and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Robot & Frank"" comes with the following special features:

  Audio Commentary - A fascinating audio commentary featuring director Jake Schreier and writer Christopher Ford who discuss the casting of the film but also how they came up with the concept and more.
  Robot Poster Campaign Gallery - A gallery of posters promoting ""Robot & Frank"".

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Robot & Frank"" is a clever film and an interesting take of the not-so-distant future of robotic caretakers and a bond between an elderly and a robot.

We have seen film about the disconnect between families, especially children and their elders.  Especially those who can't deal with the pressure of having a sick parent who is suffering from Alzheimer's, especially dementia.

But this is not one of those film's that tries to drive morality or immorality to audiences.  It's a heartfelt film about an aging father who knew he wasn't their for his children because of past mistakes.  He was a famous cat burglar who served his time, missed out on his children's years of growing up while incarcerated.  And now he's an old man that is suffering from dementia, but part of him feels there is nothing wrong.

His children are now older, have busy careers, have their own families and they can't be with him 24/7 but knowing his condition, they want to put him in a nursing home, which Frank refuses.  So, for Hunter, the only son, he decides to purchase a caretaker robot for his father.

But the robot is programmed to keep the father, Frank and his health and happiness as a priority.  The robot can learn and adapt to what Frank teaches it, but when Frank wants to feel relevant in this world, he goes back to wanting to steal.

And when Frank realizes that he can teach his new friend, a robot, to take part in crimes, but for a lonely man, he realizes that this robot is his only true friend.  One that will not hurt him intentionally, one that is not human, so it really doesn't understand the conundrums that humans may face.

But we see Frank being dependent on his new friend and what happens when his daughter Madison stops by to stay with him and deactivates the robot, especially during a time when Frank and his robot have planned a major heist.

Frank Langella does an amazing job of playing the character of Frank.  A man who feels he is perfectly fine, but deep inside, he is a man full of regret, lonely and feels that his life was exciting when he was a cat burglar.

Susan Sarandon also plays a pivotal part in the film and we eventually get to see the importance of her character right at the end of the film.  But as always, a talented actress and both she and Langella are great in the film!

And we also have James Marsden as the son who wants to get close to his father, but at the same time, isn't so close because of his father's past incarceration.  While, Liv Tyler plays the caring daughter who wants to see her father happy but without the use of a robot.  And last, you also get Peter Saarsgard as the voice of the robot.

For the most part, everything works well with this film.  While the robot was created for the film, the movements internally were done by a dancer named Rachel Ma, who had to be fitted inside the robot.  And for the most part, the movements seemed right and believable, not fake.

While some parts of the film, may seem a bit farfetched (especially when it comes to the police who suspect Frank for the thefts), fortunately those scenes are small enough to not distract from the film.  It's a cleverly written film about aging, life's regrets and friendship.  And director Jake Schreier and writer Christopher Ford manages to pull things off!

The DVD for ""Robot & Frank"" looks good as one can expect from a DVD, but no worries of major artifacts or any picture quality or audio problems. Dialogue is clear and the DVD comes with an audio commentary by director Jake Schreier and writer Christopher Ford plus a robot poster campaign gallery.

Overall, ""Robot & Frank"" is a film that is touching and also fascinating.  It's a film with a story that depends on its talent to make the film seem believable and fortunately, Frank Langella's performance makes this film worth its while.

""Robot & Frank"" is recommended!",1364601600,,5898,4.632947976878612

5414274,5,B00AENNHOE,"Standout, hilarious, touching, and thoroughly engrossing indie gem. A wonderfully rich film exploring the nature of companionship and the essential spirit of humanity.

It's the near future and Frank is suffering with Alzheimers. As his life closes in on twilight, his mind begins to betray him - forgetting a favorite restaurant having closed years ago, an ex-wife he no longer has, a middle-aged child he thinks still attends college. His one sole solace and anchor to the real world is the old bookshelf filled library; a place of continuity that is unceremoniously swept away under the guise of progress by the self-absorbed pretentious prigs of the world. Unsurprisingly, with so-called Millennials aka Generation Me, growing up in the sick social experiment of inflated and unearned self-esteem; unapologetic arrogance having sadly supplanted genuine self-confidence. We're now stuck with an astounding and frighteningly large glut of these types today.

Now, with nothing to impede the terrible progress of the disease, Frank slowly rots in a world growing less recognizable with each passing moment.

His two children try their supportive best, but they have their own lives to lead. A daughter, constantly traveling the world chasing her various causes and charities, berates a stateside sibling for not taking more time with their dad. And a son whose frustration boils over when his old man refuses to entertain a suggestion of relocating to a ""rejuvenation center"", a blend of med facility and retirement community/hospice; anything closer in proximity to his own home and family.

No thanks. Frank's not having any of that. As the stalemate worsens, his son brainstorms an idea. A robot. Around-the-clock care and he doesn't have to make the weekly ten hour round-trip journey to fulfill his filial duty. Perfect.

Or not.

Obviously, Frank's not a happy camper. Quite the curmudgeon - the thought of living with a walking, talking, overgrown microwave oven with arms has no appeal. In fact, he's insulted. But left with no choice, he's forced to take it on. And after repeated attempts to mock, humiliate, and crush the animated assistant - even he recognizes that his life and memory are improving under its care.

Their time together paralleling each others lives; of selective memories and the choice to meet one's final on your own terms. Simultaneously exploring the depth of friendship; the factors of what makes up being a buddy - a true friend. To me, there was an echo of '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cast-Away/dp/B00003CXRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cast Away</a>' in the script - a lonely soul whose desperate need to socialize overcomes his better sense, coalescing into an imaginary bud whose physical essence is a deflated volleyball. This film takes a similar idea and brilliantly expands on it.

Then, just when you have the screenplay all figured out - a twist. A most delicious surprise occurs midway through the screenplay. I won't spoil it.

Sincerely one of the most tender and soulful films I've screened in a very long time. And, for a cinephile, one of the greatest joys one can receive is a completely unexpected experience.

Absolutely five stars.

Personal Notes:

- Why this wasn't noticed by the big award committees is a mystery - a pathetic one. Because this was a subtle and powerful film filled with genuinely amazing performances. It and Frank Langella honestly deserved much more recognition.

- It was only after the film had concluded that I was stunned to learn the voice of Robot was not John Malkovich.",1364256000,,4122,5.581730769230769

5414283,3,B00AENNHOE,"**SPOILERS BELOW **

This is a sad movie that tries to be a comedy even while it focuses on the effects of dementia.  It is a story about a former cat burglar (Frank) who is increasingly showing signs of dementia and Alzheimer.  His son, who lives 5 hours away, gives his father a robot that functions as a butler/cook/housekeeper/medical assistant.

The robot is adorable and his voice and logic reminded me of the computer, Hal, on ""2001 A Space Odyssey"".  The interaction between Frank and the robot are great.  At first Frank hates the robot, but soon Frank becomes dependent on the robot and thinks of the robot as his only friend.  Sad, sad, sad.  But there are some funny moments too.  Like when Frank teaches the robot how to pick locks and open a safe, and when Frank tells the robot about the jewelry heist he has planned.  The robot goes along with the heists because the ""planning"" is stimulating Frank both mentally and physically and the stimulation is keeping Frank's dementia at bay.

If the movie had just been a story about a doddering old man planning a jewelry heist with his robot, it would have been an enjoyable caper.  But toward the end the movie started to focus more and more on the progression of Frank's dementia and the light-hearted charm of the move started to fade.  In the end I just found it sad, very very sad.",1363219200,9,1346,4.535269709543568

5414286,3,B00AENNHOE,"This movie just doesn't hang together.  There are too many missed opportunities when the director could have really explored what it means to have a human and not a robotic brain.  And there were too many times when the son and the daughter in the movie wouldn't have responded to the situations in the ways that they did.  All the actors were wonderful as expected.  It's just that the script or the director or the editor...something just limited them.  Plus, it was like the director did too much editing.  Plus, it was $12.99.  Way too expensive for anything other than a really great experience.  But, Frank Langella was great in this movie just as he is in everything he's ever done.  I wonder if he's a really nice person in real life.  I bet he is.  Also, a troubling character in the movie was the character who was taking over the library by digitizing everything.  He was just not a very literary type guy, which doesn't jive with the hard-working folks who try to keep America's public libraries up and running.  Someone like him would never be hired in the first place to work in any aspect of our library system.  Finally, our culture is stored within the physical walls of our nation's libraries.  Yes, we can digitize them; but we need the physical reminder of a physical building called a library that will continue to house the physical artifacts of civilizations' achievements and failures...and those artifacts are called books and are all stored in the library...alphabetically and by the Dewey Decimal System.",1362873600,,1531,4.768060836501901

5414293,5,B00AENNHOE,"Look up the background of writer Christopher D. Ford and director Jake Schreier and be surprised that in many ways this beautifully sculpted little film is a first serious outing.  The story is so well crafted, the direction so beautifully underplayed that this becomes an instant cinematic masterwork - albeit of the quiet, soulful, ruminative nature. The fact that it just happens to be populated with a brilliant cast who care more about being immersed in their characters than in the spotlight adds to the fact that this is a film everyone should experience.

The place is upstate New York, the time is in the near future. Frank (Frank Langella, utterly luminous in this role) is a retired, independent but brain aging (read encroaching dementia) thief/catburglar living alone in a cluttered little house while his successful son, Hunter (James Marsden), tries to care for him from afar (it is a 10 hour journey for Hunter to look in on his father every week). Hunter finally gets Frank a robot caretaker - an interference Frank loathes. Frank also has world traveling and anti-robot daughter Madison (Liv Tyler) who moves in when she discovers that a robot is running her father's life. Frank's only area of peace is the little public library run by a compassionate librarian Jennifer (Sarah Sarandon) who understands Frank's growing senility and his robot caretaker as she is facing the closure of her `book haven' by the new Internet advanced cold company headed by Jake (Jeremy Strong). Frank may not be able to communicate well with his blood family, but he grows into a relationship with his robot (voiced to perfection by Peter Sarsgaard) and soon confides his past as a jewel thief who only stole to get back at crooked insurance companies. Frank soon learns that his robot comrade is useful as a burglary aide. As Frank tries to restart his old profession, the uncomfortable realities of a changing world and his worsening dementia threaten to take beyond what any reboot can do for him. The plot is gently complex and how the film plays out is the beauty of seeing the film firsthand.  Suffice it to say this is a film about the variations of family and how plausibly aging and caregiving may be changed in the next few years, with the influx of technology and the possibilities for in-home care with robots.

The cast is strong (including a minor role by Jeremy Sisto), but the performances by Frank Langella and Susan Sarandon are especially rare and transcendent. This little unknown film is the kind of parable that allows us to see life as it is and could be in an intelligent and thoughtful way. Grady Harp, February 13",1361145600,3,2639,4.818984547461369
5414294,4,B00AENNHOE,"Susan Sarandon and Frank Langella are really up for this project which is a very nice treat. I enjoyed the film very much and the screenplay although not original on the part of the Robot what he and Frank get up to is. I watched this film and will watch it again as it is very subtle. The ending is great and that does not mean I did not enjoy the beginning or the middle.

5414298,2,B00AENNHOE,"Can't recommend it...the problem is there are so many possible interesting directions this film could go, but it never follows any one and so left me confused...what was the director, the writer -- what were they trying to convey? I kept hoping that at the end of the movie the loose ends would get tied up together but it doesn't happen. I still don't know if Frank, the character Langella plays, was really going senile...His character is a problem, he comes across as a grumpy old man, nothing endearing about him at all, I couldn't empathize with him: he's a con man, a crook and he uses his children, the robot, everyone for his own entertainment, to keep himself from being bored. So, there's no real connection with him.
The film makes a stab at being futuristic with transparent cell phones, flat screen phone technology that's really not so far out, one weird looking futuristic car amidst many other 2013 ish looking cars, and there's a theme about books disappearing and libraries digitilizing, another theme about ""human movement"" in reaction to robot helpers (while watching I thought I'd like to have a robot helper to do my errands and housecleaning!)...all of this is jumbled up with other sub-themes about dysfunctional families, youth vs. age, Robin Hoodism...I could go on. The weirdest part came toward the end when it's revealed (spoiler alert) that the librarian who Frank has had a slight flirtation with turns out to be his ex-wife. Duh?

5414300,4,B00AENNHOE,"ROBOT & FRANK is a dramedy with a slight nod to science fiction.  But its really an examination of a dysfunctional family.  Frank Langella is superb as Frank, a retired ""cat burglar"" burdened with senility and a fading memory, plus two selfish children.  Son James Marsden is tired of his weekly commitment to check in on dad so he buys him a robot to act as caregiver.  Frank initially resists the practicality of the robot's influence, but ultimately succumbs to the automaton's charms.  He enlists robot to help him pull off one final heist, developing an even stronger bond between the two.
ROBOT & FRANK is paced lethargically and methodically, but I found it engaging and involving.  It's Langella's film, but the vocal performance of Peter Saarsgard as Robot is quite impressive.  Susan Sarandon, Marsden, Liv Tyler, Jeremy Strong and Jeremy Sisto round out the effective ensemble.

Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0

'Robot and Frank' takes place in the 'near future' in Cold Spring, New York (actually shot around Rye, New York). Everything pretty much looks the same except for an occasional futuristic car passing by and Skpe- like video phone messages coming through large screen TVs inside the home. One other thing: there are now sophisticated but small robots available to perform household chores and act as home care attendants.

When aging ex-con and petty thief, Frank (played by Frank Langella), begins exhibiting signs of dementia, his son Hunter buys him a robot to take care of chores around the house and put the old man on a new healthy regimen consisting of good diet and exercise. Perhaps the best part of the film is how the curmudgeonly Frank adapts to the robot--at first he resents its presence but when Frank discovers that the robot is not programmed to have a moral conscience (an unlikely twist!), he begins training it to pick locks and join him in his reinvigorated life of crime. Frank even begins not to mind the healthy food the robot has been preparing for him.

Just as Frank is becoming obsolete, so is the local library run by Jennifer (Susan Sarandon) who sadly is forced by a local developer to dispose of their entire print collection; with all the books being transformed into digital copies. Frank gets the idea that if he steals a rare copy of Don Quixote and ultimately returns it to Jennifer, that will please her. This is the first rather unfunny scene involving a burglary.

Things pick up a bit when Frank's daughter, Madison, an activist who believes humans shouldn't rely on robots, gums things up when she arrives at the family home and insists on caring for Frank, herself. She turns the robot off which interferes with Frank's plans to commit burglary #2. When Frank intentionally turns the house into a pigsty, she's forced to use the robot for cleaning and eventually agrees to allow her father to use the robot, but only periodically during the day.

One gets the feeling that screenwriter Christopher Ford runs out of real creative ideas to move the plot along in the second half. The plot is rather silly, with Frank targeting Jake, the developer responsible for renovating the library. Jake is a cartoon bad guy and we're not supposed to feel bad that Frank burglarized his home. Frank and the Robot end up swiping some expensive jewels belonging to Jake's wife but he convinces the police to put Frank under 24 hour surveillance. It's all very awkward with a bunch of cartoon cops waiting outside in a van, who eventually are able to gain entrance into the home (I can't recall if a warrant was actually revealed but I believe Frank invites the police in).

Before you know it, Frank realizes that all the evidence is on the Robot's hard drive and he must wipe it clean before the police access it. The wiped hard drive is equated with Frank's growing dementia as his memory is 'wiped clean' too at film's end. This becomes apparent when his adult children visit him at a new fangled 'memory center' and we see Frank's dementia is now full blown.

There is also another revelation before Frank loses all his marbles: Jennifer the librarian is actually Frank's ex-wife. It's supposed to be poignant but since Susan Sarandon is given so little to do beforehand, the little surprise hardly makes a mark.

The one big saving grace for 'Robot and Frank' is Frank Langella's assured performance as the determined curmudgeon. His surly relationship with the robot provides enough entertainment for most of the film. The narrative falters when Frank commits the pair of unfunny bumbling burglaries, suggesting that the screenwriter was not up to the task of finding a truly clever ending for this lightweight property.",1359590400,5,3818,4.799086757990867
