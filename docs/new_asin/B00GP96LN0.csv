8626048,5,B00GP96LN0,"Very powerful review and expose of corporate-controlled media.. the massive influence on people's thinking and perception, also how much news is withheld from our awareness (for so many years now).. Film is well done, and recommended to anyone who tries to follow the news.. I've tried to find more and more alternate, independent sources of news.. that helps some, but these independents are struggling to survive, in our current environment..  I'm glad to have an opportunity to praise this work and all who were a part of it.. Thanks.",1471392000,2,537,5.033707865168539
8626049,4,B00GP96LN0,"Fascinating, well documented coverage of the influence of government, corporate and organized crime over the media and how it shapes what journalism actually makes it to the page/on air in the U.S.  Covers very controversial investigative reporting that has been attacked and derailed by the powerful people and organizations it threatened to expose.  Great teaching tool for courses on civics, ethics, journalism, social studies and history, as well as homeschooling, for high school level and above.",1412812800,8,501,5.578947368421052
