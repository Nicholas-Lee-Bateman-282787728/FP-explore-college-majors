8205735,5,B000SKX0NG,DVD is excellent.  The book was not so good.  There seemed to be a lot of filler in the book.,1400371200,,93,3.6
8205736,5,B000SKX0NG,"this will not help you play drums better..........but it will make you look cool while doing it ......... what it seemed to me is someone wanted to make a lil money and tried to set up a profesional dvd with tricks you can do with drum sticks...... recording is not good bad not horrible... its slow.......but some tricks are unique will build up hand and finger muscles and are cool and even though it doesnt seem profesional the teacher does try to spend as much time teaching you in many different ways giving you multiple examples and practice routines.......

i could of made this dvd myself ....
if you have a few bucks and want to add some flare to your playlist then this is a good dvd",1236211200,4,693,4.4140625
