5091829,5,B007JTNJUI,I just love Mrs Browns Boys and the live tour was not a disappointment. It was funny and kept you laughing the whole way through.,1367452800,2,129,4.2
5091830,5,B007JTNJUI,"It's pretty much most of the stories from season one, but there  are changes which helps keep the material fresh! new jokes, new situations, and Buster in a diaper!

It's worth the money!

What is neat is that some cast member have dual roles, and I didn't realize it until part way through the show.",1364601600,,300,4.418181818181818
5091831,3,B007JTNJUI,not quite the same as the tv show even tho it was basically season 1 condensed. Still good to watch,1362528000,,99,4.0
5091832,5,B007JTNJUI,"This is one of the funniest skits/shows around.  You must have a DVD player that will play European DVD's or adjust your computer, but it's really worth the trouble.  The BBC series is quicker, quirkier, and paced faster, but there's nothing better than a stage and a live audience.  Worth every laugh- eliciting penny!",1359158400,,319,4.87037037037037
