2509615,4,B000E8NRBM,"Based on a true story, THE STAIRCASE is one of those uplifting Christian movies heavy on morals and faith, and thanks to an intelligent script and very good performances, it works.

Barbara Hershey gives a smooth and touching performance as Mother Madeleine, a dying nun who wants to see the completion of a chapel in the Santa Fe territory before she dies.  This seems impossible when the architect ""forgets"" to put in a staircase to the choir loft.  Without the funds necessary to complete the staircase, that dream seems unlikely...until a mysterious stranger named Mr. Joad shows up out of nowhere and offers to build a spiral staircase with no charge.  CSI's William Petersen gives a strong understated performance as Joad, whose mission becomes both a blessing and a curse as the original contractors (David Clennon and Justin Louis) don't want Joad to do the staircase.  It may all play out with predictable results but it's sincerity is so genuine, it's a fine little film.",1158710400,80,981,4.921212121212121

the acting was a too dramatic for my taste, so the director made the story more of a melodrama, and inserted a trend toward romance  which is unnecessary and untruthful.  so I give it 4 stars",1450310400,2,400,4.391891891891892

2509665,5,B000E8NRBM,"This is is a special little movie, it is my favorite William Peterson film. He plays a mysterious character called Jode. Jode is a traveling carpenter, seeking to help people wearever he is led. Barbara Hershey is at her best as Mother Madeleine, she plays the head Mother of the order of the Sisters Of Loretto who is dying of cancer. Mother Madelaine has a painful and scarred past. Many of the main characters have skeletons in their closet's and pain that masks who they really are. When the mistake of forgetting to build a staircase to the choir loft at their newly built chapel is discovered the ""sisters""pray for a miracle. Jode rides into the town and comes up with a brilliant idea of building a circular staircase. This movie is truly a beautiful story about faith and healing. Jode is a miracle worker but his special gift of seeing into men's hearts.",1430179200,,863,4.6103896103896105

2509709,5,B000E8NRBM,"This 95-minute film on a bare-bones DVD aired on CBS in 1998. It's an uplifting feel-good movie that recalls the style of Hallmark and Lifetime made-for-TV films, but ""The Staircase"" has an unexpected spiritual depth that puts it a cut above those other productions. Barbara Hershey plays an ailing Catholic mother superior whose only wish is to see the Sisters of Loretto chapel in Santa Fe completed before she dies. Diane Ladd is a sympathetic nun and William Peterson of TV's ""CSI"" is the mysterious carpenter who volunteers to build a spiral staircase after the original builders forget to provide access to the chapel's choir loft.

Based on the real-life Loretto chapel, now a museum attached to a hotel in Santa Fe, this film excels at suggesting the miraculous in everyday human qualities rather than hitting the viewer over the head with special effects or heavy-handed allegory. The relationship between Hershey and Peterson, despite Hershey's inconsistent Irish accent and Peterson's sometimes too-relaxed performance, grows unexpectedly poignant as the film progresses. The human relations in this film are so perfectly observed that even a potentially melodramatic subplot gets resolved in a satisfying way before it derails the film. These are signs of unusual quality in the production.

While the movie starts out on a nondescript footing, giving hints of Western cliches that recall old ""nuns in the Wild West"" films, it gradually accumulates power after Peterson finds his way into the story. Honestly, I didn't expect to be moved so deeply by this film, as the story in itself didn't suggest much in the way of originality. But you really have to see this film to believe it: It's one of the most mature, spiritually rich, and humanized portrayals of religion on film that you will ever see. It's also one of the few films where you're not entirely certain just how it will end, other than expecting the staircase to be completed. The plot is simple, but the depth of relationships are deep. I highly recommend it.",1398816000,12,2034,5.032640949554896
2509710,4,B000E8NRBM,"If you are a Christian and want a great movie this is one for your collection. There is a murder scene and a little blood, but I think that is the worst of it.

2509711,5,B000E8NRBM,"I remember when CBS first aired this back in 1998. I fell in love with it instantly. Hershey and Peterson are superb in their lead roles as Mother Madalyn and 'Joad'. Originally titled 'The Spiral Staircase', this is the true story of the legendary spiral staircase built for the Loredo Chapel in Santa Fe NM, by a mysterious drifter. After original contractors 'accidentally overlooked' the actual staircase while remodeling the old chapel and its choir loft, ""Joad"" arrives on-scene as the answer to their prayer, and coincidentally armed with fine carpentry skills, builds the sisters their wooden spiral staircase entirely without the use of nails.

Diane Ladd also costars as Sister Margaret, Mother Madalyn's right-hand.",1398211200,,726,5.3130434782608695

The staircase [the actual staircase (or lack thereof)] in the movie is given an inordinate amount of attention and imbued with a sense of importance that is just not believable. They even go so far as to shine a heavenly light on the floor where the staircase is destined to be while playing divine choir voices in the background. For me, that is where the movie completely jumped the shark. I had to stop watching. If you are buying this only because William Peterson is a great actor, think again.

The two of them share a great chemistry (they acted together in Return to Lonesome Dove in 1993) that leaps off the screen.  This is a true story of a mysterious carpenter that showed up out of nowhere to create this spiral staircase without the use of nails then disappeared once it was done.

Out of no where a man comes and builds a beautiful staircase without any nails or supporting columns. William Petersen plays this part beautifully, as if he has been sent from god to answer the sisters prayers. He portrays a warm, loving and almost spiritual character.

2509822,1,B000E8NRBM,"I haven't seen this movie in a long time, but I recall having three major complaints.

The first complaint, which is fairly minor, was the way they portrayed Hershey's character. In the beginning of the movie, she was very crabby and irritable.

The second complaint, which I dealt with, was the casting of Barbara Hershey (of all people) as a nun. I respect and admire nuns and what they stand for. They could have at least gotten a respectable and decent woman to play the nun. Instead, they chose a woman who has given public scandal and publicly exposed herself on many occasions -- and without the slightest bit of repentance (that I'm aware of). I'm pretty sure she was in an X-Rated movie as well. This is not the woman who should be cast in this role. I find it insulting and I wouldn't be surprised if all nuns felt the same.

The third, and this is what made me decide never to watch it again, was the strange and uncomfortable sexual tension between Hershey's nun character and Peterson's character. It was highly inappropriate and made me sick to my stomach watching it. At times I was just waiting for the ""nun fallen in-love"" angle. Thank God it never happened! Even so, her physical expressions (the way she looked, stared, smiled at him etc.) suggested she had some sort of feelings for him and was enough to ruin the movie. This seems to be a common occurrence in movies about nuns (I can name at least 3 other films off the top of my head). Do not watch this movie!",1253404800,9,1483,4.464944649446495
2509823,4,B000E8NRBM,"I'm not Catholic, but I think anyone who enjoys movies of faith will like this one.
The story is about a group of nuns who have traveled from Kentucky to Santa Fe, New Mexico Territory, circa 1876.  They are led by a general-like Mother Suuperiior, Mother Madelaine(Barbara Hershey).  Through hard work, she and her group are able to build a convent.  All it lacked was a chapel.  Using her forcefull personality, she is able to get a local contractor, Mr. Philger(David Clennon)to accomplish the goal. In the process of building the chapel a mistake is made wherein the stairs to the choir loft are forgotten.  Madelaine cannot get money to fix the problem so she prays for answer to her problem.  In the process of the story, a man rides out of the desert on a mule.  He claims to be a carpenter and offers to build the stairs.  The man Joad(William Petersen) and Madelaine develope a deep affection for one another as they both put their hearts into building the staircase.
At the end Joad disappears into the desert in the same abrupt way he arrived.
Although this story has been embelleshed by writers it is based on the true story of the ""Sisters of Our Lady of the Light"" in Sante Fe, New Mexico.

Madelaine is supported by what could only be described as her conscious, Sister Margret played by Diane Ladd.

Petersen played his role of Joad with sensitivity and humility as one would expect from a man of faith assiting the nuns.  Diane Ladd was given a small part in this movie, but being the professional she is, she took it and made it her own.  I loved her portrayal of Margret.  I was definitely supprised by Barbara Hershey's performance of Mother Madelaine.  I was disappointed, her performance was flat, with little genioun emotion.  She played the character as a one-sided person and even my untrained eye could tell there were more layers to the character than what she brought across.

All in all, I really like this movie and do recommend it.",1244246400,,1962,4.610951008645533

It was believable which is a good thing since the Staircase is a true recollection. I was immediately drawn to it when I was flipping stations one day. I was instantly involved in the storyline though I hadn't seen the beginning on that particular day. Ever since then I have desired to see the movie in it's entirety and now I can proudly say I own it and it is just as inspirational each time I watch it as it was on that first time.

2509838,5,B000E8NRBM,"This is one of my favorite movies. It is a drama based on a true story. It is a legendary story in Santa Fe New Mexico. There is a church there that was built in the early 1800's. The place for the choir was built on the second floor but the architect and the builder forgot to build a staircase to get to it! The Architect dies and leaves the nuns(Barbara Hershey)with a dilemma and no more money to fix it. When things couldn't get any worse Barbara Hershey's character finds out she is dying of cancer. All seems hopeless and after much prayer by the nuns a stranger (William Peterson)rides into the town. Challenged by their situation He agrees to help them build a staircase. The true story and quite a mystery is stranger didn't use one nail to make a spiral staircase that stands to this day. William Petersons character becomes good friends with Barbara Hershy and does more then just complete a church He also helps the nuns and other characters face their deepest wounds held in their souls by holding up a mirror of unconditional love and showing them there is a way out of their pain. By the end of the movie your left wondering who William Peterson character truely was. He didn't ask for compensation or recognition for the work, and when he finished, he slipped out of town quietly. I was thrilled to find it out on dvd.",1208563200,6,1335,4.453061224489796

2509842,5,B000E8NRBM,"The other reviews outline the plot, so I won't retell it.  I'll just tell you what I like about it.

What is interesting to me, is that the staircase is really there and it really was built by a mysterious stranger with technology and techniques that were rarely practiced at the the time.

I don't know if it was a miracle, or just a kind man that wanted to help those in need.  Either way, it is an inspiring story.

On the question whether or not it was a miracle, there is something that took place historically that doesn't appear in the movie.  The nuns had been praying to St. Joseph the carpenter for nine days.  On the ninth day, the stranger showed up and subsequently started working on the mysterious staircase.  This ""coincidence"" has caused many people to believe that the mysterious stranger was St. Joseph himself.

The movie is very inspiring because, whether you believe there is a divine or saintly intervention or not, it is refreshing to see people help each other.  If there is one thing that I love to see, it is the charity and care that some people glady give to their fellow human beings.  It other words, whether divine or humanistic, it is a tale of kindness.

It is nice to see something like this on your television screen and a great family movie.",1184716800,20,1278,4.484848484848484
2509843,5,B000E8NRBM,"This movie would be good for everyone to see. It was about a spiral staircase which was built by a stranger. There were no nails used and the type of wood was a pine that only grows in about 10 locations on the Northern continent. The construction of the staircase was that of a helix design. This means the steps revolved around and around a single core (helix)which also was springy vertical depending on how much weight was on the staircase. The staircase was completed many years ago in Santa Fe, New Mexico and still stands today,and maybe visited. A real good movie.",1182902400,36,572,4.563106796116505
2509844,1,B000E8NRBM,"That's all I could think of when my family and I sat down to watch this movie together.  We had told the story to our children about the miraculous staircase built without nails in a small chapel in Santa Fe.  The story itself is so powerful and moving. Built in the 1870s, the chapel was nearly complete when it became apparent the choir loft stairs would not fit. The sisters' prayed a novena to St. Joseph and on the ninth day their prayers were answered when a mysterious carpenter arrived, built the ""miraculous"" staircase, and then disappeared without being paid. The staircase is a double helix with no visible support. It's 23 feet tall and makes two 360 degree spirals, and the wood used is not a known wood in any area near Santa Fee!

This movie however is about a mother superior who has faith but harbors real resentment towards Indians and also likes to curse (how this has anything to do with the actual story I still have no idea!).  At one point when a nun is ""shocked"" to hear mother curse mother surperior responds ""Oh Margret get off the cross and get down here with the rest of us"".  When the mysterious carpenter shows up and starts to build the staircase, the architect and the contractor decide that this is a bad thing and threaten to kill the carpenter.  Meanwhile this carpenter who is sent by ""God"" builds the staircase with wood that doesn't work, is arrested after being falsly accused of attempted murder, and leaves everyone to believe vandalls destroyed the staircase when in fact he originally destroyed it before rebuilding it better.  In the end the staircase is built and this mother superior (who is on death's door) is so moved that she literally crawls up the staircase in a very ""weird""/""uncomfortable"" scene until she reaches the choir loft and dies.  Wow, inspiring.

The best thing I could think of is this director and writer took a wonderful and moving story and turned it into a Hollywood flop. This was obviously written, directed, and produced by people who have no idea how the staircase was built but are pretty darn sure it wasn't a miracle because hey, miracles just don't happen. The acting was pretty good but the story was junk.  Unfortunately I bought this movie.

If you are looking for a true inspirational movie that you can watch with your family, rent or buy Mother Theresa with Olivia Hussey.  Hands down the best Saints movie every filmed.  Half way through the movie my 5 year old says out loud ""Wow, she REALLY cares about everybody!""  Inspirational movie, compared to this disappointment.",1176076800,15,2555,4.686800894854586
