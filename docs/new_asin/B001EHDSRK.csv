3554278,5,B001EHDSRK,"Best show that ever ran on Nickelodeon. Their decision to cancel it was a shame and a true loss for both the network and us viewers.  Maybe if enough of us fans write to Nickelodeon, they will change their minds and put it back into production. In the meantime, thank goodness for these new DVDs.",1220140800,3,296,4.381818181818182
3554279,5,B001EHDSRK,"NOT A REVIEW. Very good show, its just such a bummer it was canceled.  Maybe if enough people buy the DVD's they bring it back.  This was like the last good cartoon on Nickelodeon.  Now all they have are those damn teen shows.  But whatever, I guess you have to pander to the majority.",1219881600,,285,4.222222222222222

3554375,5,B001EHDSRK,"I love Danny's in your face attitude in this season. He knows what he's doing he just doesn't know how to get people on his side. This season holds epic battles such as the one with Pariah Dark and Danny's ""jerky older slef."" Although I love just about every episode in this season you cannot forget about The Ultimate Enemy we get to see just how powerful Danny actually is. My favorite charater is Clockwork though we do get to see some pretty neat characters and have episodes spotlighting ones we already know, Clockwork stood out to me the most.
If you can only get one season get this one.

3554377,4,B001EHDSRK,"My 6 (almost 7) year old son was obsessed with this show.  We let him watch 1-2 episodes every night until he burned through the entire run of the series and then he was sad it was over.  It is actually pretty cute and entertaining enough that it could entertain an adult if one had time to watch it.  So, I caught a couple of the shows.  The themes seemed similar to Phineas and Ferb where the parents look silly and unaware, and I do not really like that, but it seems to be a common theme in kid's shows.  Unfortunately, It did not have any educational value of which I was aware.",1386979200,,583,4.123893805309734

3554396,5,B001EHDSRK,This show is from the same creators of Fairly Odd parents and TUFF Puppy. One major thing about this is the issues it deals with regarding teens and their high school encounters.

3554417,3,B001EHDSRK,"Reading over the reviews, I was worried that I would drop $30 on Season 2 and not get all the episodes. Following another user's suggestion I ordered part one from Route 66, and then ordered part two from Amazon. Route 66 shipped very quickly and I received both DVDs around the same time. I double checked and all of the episodes are there, but there are multiple duplicate episodes and they are all out of order. This doesn't bother me too much; I just wanted a physical copy of the show and I wanted to make sure all of the episodes were there.

Both DVDs include the double episodes Reign Storm on Part One and Reality Trip and The Ultimate Enemy on Part Two. The quality of the videos is very good. The only real problem, like mentioned before, is the fact that the episodes are out of order and there are duplicates. Really, whoever put these two DVDs together did a pretty awful job, and it's kind of silly to have to buy two separate DVDs for the complete season. There are no bonus features and the menu in the beginning is very simple; it just loops the theme song over and over again (which gets a bit annoying after awhile, so I would recommend trying to not fall asleep while playing the DVD.) However I'm honestly not too picky about it-- I only really cared that the episodes were intact and they are. If you grew up watching Danny Phantom like I did and aren't too concerned about the ordering of the episodes, then I suggest trying this out.",1369180800,,1458,4.380073800738008

3554430,3,B001EHDSRK,It seems ridiculous to have to pay for two DVD's for one season.  They also have some of the same episodes from the first DVD.,1357430400,2,126,4.04
3554431,4,B001EHDSRK,"I've loved Danny Phantom forever, and I was really excited to get these DVD's.  I didn't, however, want to pay $45 for both, so I ordered Part 1 from Route 66 and Part 2 from another company.  I got Part 1 first, and the episodes were in this order:
Reign Storm, Part 1
Reign Storm, Part 2
Doctor's Disorders
Identity Crisis
Fenton Menace
Pirate Radio
The Fright Before Christmas
Micro-Management
Masters of All Time
Beauty Marked

Part 2 came a few days later, in this order:
Memory Blank
Double Episode: The Ultimate Enemy
The Fright Before Christmas
Secret Weapons
Flirting With Disaster
Micro Management
Beauty Marked
King Tuck
Masters of All Time
Double Episode: Reality Trip
Double Cross My Heart
Kindred Spirits

So I checked and I received all of the episodes, but 4 of them were doubled.  I'm fine with this, but I read a review and the person said they got all of Season 2 on the Part 1 DVD when they bought it from Amazon, in the correct order, and I wonder if I just bought Part 1 and got all the episodes if it would have been less expensive.

Anyway, love the show!  Can't wait till Season 3 is out!",1357257600,2,1113,4.426470588235294

We had checked all of the local stores -- including those that only sell videos -- and none of them had this in stock...on the day it was released! Some stores said they could order it but their prices were all much higher than the cost at Amazon. I ordered through Amazon since this was the only place I could find that had this in stock. I knew we'd have to wait for delivery but at least I knew it was on its way, and I was able to track the package. When it arrived early, my son was really happy...and so was I!

Now unlike some people I won't give this one a 1 star, I have loved this show ever since Invader Zim went off air (I think that show is fine now but I was 8 years old at the time and the show was targeted to 10 year olds apparently.) but I just hope that in the next dvd, for Shout Factories sake, they better well put in ""The Ultimate Enemy"" or someone will minus well be a ghost. Overall I give this show a 10 but for the dvd a 6.5.

Because this was taken off the air, my girls never really got to experience the series, but in watching this collection of episodes, my girls enjoyed them and kept asking me to share more with them (which I was happy to do)!

Danny starts worrying about the big C.A.Ts coming up. He starts getting freaked. Especially when new ghosts start showing up from the future. Danny stumbles upon the test answers to the big test and starts wondering if he should use the sheet to ""study"". Following his nasty encounter with Skulktech, Danny meets Clockwork the master of time. Danny sees a glimpse of his future, which includes him becoming evil and destroying Amity Park. Attempting an escape, he goes to the future, where he meets his older self. After Tucker and Sam find a way back, older Danny makes sure Danny cant leave the future and throws him into the Ghostzone and takes over as regular Danny in the present to make sure he cheats on the test. While floating helplessly in the Ghostzone, Danny comes across his foes in older form. During confrontation, Danny blasts them with a power he's not supposed get for twenty years : ghostly wail. Danny meets older Vlad, who tells him about what happened to him to make him mad. Danny requests help from Vlad to remove the time medalian from him so he can return to present time and save his family and friends and even Lanser. Danny returns to defeat dark Dan but not in enough time to save his friends. However, due to the circumstances,  Clockwork helps him go back in time to make things right. In the end Jada reveals she knew Danny's secret for a while and it ends with Clockwork and the observants discussing the responsibility for Dark Dan now he is out of his time era.

3554442,4,B001EHDSRK,"Danny Phantom is back!

Shout Factory! has now released the second season (ala part 1)  on DVD and that can only mean more adventures with Danny Fenton, Tucker and Sam!

Before Nickelodeon's ""The Fairy Odd Parents"" and ""T.U.F.F. Puppy"", in 2004, American animator and series creator Butch Hartman had created the animated series ""Danny Phantom"". Aired on Nickelodeon in 2004-2007, the series was produced by Billionfold Studios.

""Danny Phantom"" is a series that focused on the adventures of a teenager named Danny Fenton who has parents who are well-known ghost hunters. His parents created a Ghost Portal which would bridge the real world with the Ghost Zone but when Danny tried to use it, the Ghost Portal didn't work. But while inside the portal, he turned on the ""on"" button (which his parents forgot existed) and it activated the portal.

Because he was inside of the portal, the portal fused with his DNA with ectoplasm and now he has been transformed into Danny Phantom.

The only one that knows his secret is his best friends Sam (a goth vegetarian) and Tucker (who is a technophile and a meat-lover) but somehow Danny's parents have an inkling that one of their children may be a ghost but instead of think Danny is the ghost, they think it's his older sister Jasmine.

But Danny now has these powers that allow him to be a ghost which allows him to fly, be invisible and eventually through the season, learns that he has other powers. And now, Danny uses his powers for good against bad ghosts that are plaguing his hometown.

While the series has been released on DVD before (albeit not including all episodes which frustrated ""Danny Phantom"" fans), the license for ""Danny Phantom"" has been acquired by Shout! Factory and fortunately, the secnd season, part one of ""Danny Phantom"" will feature the 10 episodes on DVD.

Episode listing on ""Danny Phantom: Season 2, Part 1' DVD are as follows (note: these are spoilerless summaries):

NOTE:  It's important to note that the episodes featured inside the DVD cover are incorrect (as confirmed with Shout! Factory).  The correct episodes are as featured:

DISC 1:

  EPISODE 24 - Reign Storm, Part One - Vlad frees the evil ghost king Paraiah Dark, now the city of Amity Park is in trouble.
  EPISODE 25 - Reign Storm, Part Two - Danny, Valerie and Vlad must work together to stop the evil ghost king Paraiah Dark.
  EPISODE 22 - Doctor's Disorders - Ghost bugs have invaded Casper High.
  EPISODE 26 - Identity Crisis - Danny wants to prioritize his life and so he uses Fenton Ghostcatcher to split his alter-ego.
  EPISODE 27 - The Fenton Menace - The young pirate Younblood continues to bother Danny.

DISC 2:

  EPISODE 23 - Pirate Radio - Danny encounters a bratty ghost known as Youngblood.
  EPISODE 30 - The Fight Before Christmas - Danny behaves like a grinch during the holidays.
  EPISODE 33 - Micro-Management - Jack's new invention accidentally shrinks Danny and Dash.
  EPISODE 36 - Masters of All Time - Vlad (who is suffering from ecto-acne) infects Tucker and Sam, now Danny must find a cure.
  EPISODE 34 - Beauty Marked - Sam signs up for a beauty pageant.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Danny Phantom: Season 2, Part 1' is presented in full screen (1:33:1) and presented in Dolby Digital. For those familiar with this animated series, ""Danny Phantom"" uses strong lines around the characters and bold colors. In fact, the series is quite vibrant and colorful and looks great on DVD.

Dialogue, special effects and music are quite clear coming through the center and front channels. I chose to watch the series via stereo on all channels for a more immersive soundscape but for the most part, picture and audio quality for this series on DVD is very good.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Danny Phantom: Season 2, Part 1' comes with no special features.

JUDGMENT CALL:

More fun and action with Danny, Tucker and Sam as they encounter Vlade, pirates, ghosts and more in this latest DVD release!

In our household, Butch Hartman animated series reigns supreme. Every morning, my young son must have his dose of ""The Fair Odd Parents"" or ""T.U.F.F. Puppy"" and before these two series, he was all about ""Danny Phantom"".

If anything, it was an introduction for him as a young child to watch a series that brings a ghost hunter taking on bad ghosts in a hilarious and fun way.

And many times I have watched this series with him and what I liked about it is that it was a series crafted not just for the kids but also for teens or adults. These were continuous storylines that feature a young teenager with his powers and also dealing with high school bullies, being unpopular but enjoying life by hanging out with friends but taking on bad ghosts. So, in a way, it has a similarity to popular superhero storylines such as Spider-Man and Superman (but in a more Dr. Strange meets Ghostbusters kind of way). And also, he is a character that is not perfect and that many kids probably can relate to.

Also, the artistic look of the series, especially with its character designs and its bold strokes will no doubt capture your attention and it's a visual style that continues today through Hartman's latest animated series.

But the series has a lot of factors that make is so accessible and entertaining. From Danny's family to his best friends but also the other characters that he meets through school or the ghosts that he encounters, there's always something new in each episode and not rehash of the same stories over and over again.

As for the DVD release, you get ten episodes from the first season.  I know a few fans have complained that episodes are missing but having spoken to Shout! Factory, the problem stems from the episode listing which were incorrectly printed in the inside cover.  The episodes featured on the DVD (and featured in our episode listing is correct).  I did ask if there will be a reprint of the cover and was told by the rep that he would be looking into it.  I know a lot of people were expecting the release of ""The Ultimate Enemy"" as stated in the DVD insert, but hopefully we will see the episodes in season 2, part 2.

Although I do wish they followed the first season DVD release and included four DVD's and 20-episodes, you do get 10 episodes with this season, part 1 DVD release and of course, the price is much cheaper.  As for the episodes, not sure if the episode listing is based on production number but I do know it is different from air date.

Still, ""Danny Phantom"" is an enjoyable episode that many fans love.  While I hope the typo doesn't upset too many fans, it's still a DVD worth getting if you are a fan!

Overall, if you were a big fan of ""Danny Phantom"" back then or just a person who is young at heart and want an animated series with a ghost-busting storyline, definitely give ""Danny Phantom: Season 2, Part 1' a try!",1335571200,3,6824,4.648580968280467
3554443,1,B001EHDSRK,"When I first preordered this DVD, I was very excited to finally be able to watch The Ultimate Enemy, because I'd only seen it once when I was younger and can only remember bits and pieces of it. The shipping was fast (only two days after it came out) and the second it got here I rushed to my room to watch it, only to be disappointed.

On the case, the episodes included were listed as follows:
DISC ONE:
Memory blank
Doctor's disorders
Pirate radio
Reign storm part one
Reign storm part two

DISC TWO:
Identity crisis
Fenton menace
The ultimate enemy part one
The ultimate enemy part two
The fright before Christmas.

In reality, the episodes on the actual DVD are:
DISC ONE:
Reign storm part one
Reign storm part two

As you can see,  both ""The Ultimate Enemy"" and ""Memory Blank"" are missing entirely, while micromanagement, masters of all time, and beauty marked aren't even on it!!

So yeah, if you don't care about quality, go ahead and buy this DVD.

Throughout the series he gains more control, and takes on the roll as a superhero fighting ghosts.  I really love this series and wish that it lasted longer than just three seasons.  Honestly the first episode is a bit hokey exaggerating the personalities of his friends Sam, and Tucker. After the first episode it calms down, and works out very well.  Again my only real problem with the series is that it only lasted three seasons, definitely worth a watch.  Also heads up if you plan to watch this through streaming!  Some of the two part episodes that are considered movies can be placed out of sequence.

For someone who is an avid fan or very typical on the order of things: You may find one episode out of place.

After looking at a season guide, it appears to be only the season 2 episodes and they're all there.  But oh my god are they all out of order.  They put ""Memory Blank"", the one that kick starts the season and explains the new logo on his costume, at the end of disc three.  They put the two double episodes, ""Reality Trip"" and ""Ultimate Enemy"" on the last disc.  And of course, they screw up the order of just those two and put ""Reality Trip"" first.  My recommendation, if you got my version and want to watch them in order, put them all in a DVD changer.  That way you don't have to take out and put in a disc every time to you want to watch the next one.

Oh, and for those who got the other incomplete version of season 2, return it and buy this one.  It may be out of order, but at least it's all there as far as I know.  Here's what's on it (and yes, they are in this order...).

3554464,4,B001EHDSRK,"Season Two, barnone, is my favorite season of ""Danny Phantom"". After the first season established the characters and stories, this one takes them further and creates a deeper, more complex offering that culminates in a satisfying season finale.

The season starts of perfectly with a large tribute to the first 20 episodes by telling Danny Phantom's origin and large continuity nods to past episodes. Outside of a forced Danny/Sam romance (and a haphazard way of throwing in his ""DP"" logo), the episode wonderfully starts off Season Two. ""Doctor's Disorder"" presents a nice boost for Tucker and a mysterious plot centering on Spectra remains engaging, but is nothing to speak about. ""Pirate Radio"" is an excellent character development story for Danny who takes full responsibility by concentrating on the weirdness going on with the adults' sudden disappearance despite his friends and peers partying away. ""Reign Storm"" continues forth by wrapping up what ""Public Enemies"" started as Danny risks his very life to save his town despite their constant accusation. Along with it, the romance plot moves and Sam has a rival in the form of Valerie. There's also a keen team-up from friends and foes alike to battle a powerful enemy. Under slightly different circumstances, I would have liked this to have been the series finale then the mixed, abysmal ""Phantom Planet"".

""Identity Crisis"" provides a lighthearted breather with antics from two split Dannys - one fun, the other all hero - in all its Looney Tune-ish glory. ""The Fenton Menace"" isn't the best Jazz-episode, but it again supports her character growth and lets her know she doesn't have to be such an uptight ""adult"" all the time, as well as realize her younger brother is growing up. He doesn't need to hold her hand anymore. ""The Ultimate Enemy"" is an excellent look at the kind of person Danny can be if his powers got out of hand. Starting from ""Splitting Images"", Danny's struggle over the darkness inside him over his ghost powers ends in full when he refuses to give in to it. It's a roller coaster ride into time with the only major problem being that it should have been half an hour longer; some plot holes could have been answered better, especially why Danny Phantom overshadowed Vlad Plasmius in the alternate timeline. Either way, it's one of the biggest highlights of DP.

""The Fright Before Christmas"" is typical holiday nonsense complete with peace and love and all that corny fluff. It's nothing bad, but I can't say it's good either. ""Secret Weapons"" may have turned Jazz into a total goof, but it otherwise does an excellent job wrapping up her character. Incidentally, it's also my favorite animated of DP, the ending battle between Danny and Jazz are beautifully-colored. ""Flirting With Disasters"" is an emotional battle between Danny and Valerie's feelings as well as their unintentional conflicts as enemies from their alter egos. An epic battle in space is made all the more better when Danny accidentally hurts her; a rare powerful scene for this show. Too bad they don't last beyond this, I would have liked to have seen more romantic bond between the two before they caved in with the predictable Danny/Sam.

""Micro Management"" would have worked better as a Season One episode, this felt too much Aesop then I wanted, Danny Fenton, even as a human, should not be this weak after months of fighting (and after showing he CAN fight ghosts as a human in the earlier episode ""Pirate Radio""). Along with needless abuse for Tucker, Sam herself comes off as a severe Mary Sue here. ""Beauty Marked"" continues the Mary Sueish path for Sam by making Danny degrade in personality (him surrounded by girls an episode after his feelings for Valerie? Bah!), but at least they show off her beliefs and actions very well, proving she isn't the damsel in distress type. ""King Tuck"" is a continuous of Tucker's inferior complexity first seen in ""What You Want"", but it's a poorly made episode with a boring villain whose betrayal I saw coming a mile away and Tucker again getting the short end of the stick despite the Aesop of the day being, ""listen to your friends."" ""Masters of All Time"" is an excellent ""What If"" look if Vlad had married Maddie. The fact that he behaves exactly the same as his canon counterpart is chilling and makes him, ironically, more sympathetic and complicated.

""Reality Trip"" makes a good summer action flick as it boils down to a nice 45 minute chase scene, but they don't take advantage of the key plots as Danny erases his parents for no reason (grr) and Valerie remains absent despite such a plot begging for her. I liked ""Double Cross My Heart""...back when it was called ""Flirting With Disaster"". It's essentially the same as that, only role reversed, this time Danny being the jealous one as Sam dates someone else. It isn't a bad episode, but it's got nothing on ""FwD"" outside of establishing that Danny finally realizes he likes Sam. Again, I wished Sam had continued dating Gregor (despite who he really is) to add some form of ""oomph"" in the weak love triangle. ""Kindred Spirits"" host a pointless Tucker and Sam subplot that makes Danny come off as an unnecessary jerk and Danielle Phantom is a useless, pointless, unforgiving plot device, but Vlad's emotions and insanity after months of rejection and fear of loneliness drives this episode as one of my personal favorite, if not my all-time favorite episode.

Now that the DVD contains all 20 episodes, there's no excuse not to grab it. However it'll be a frustrating endeavor. The series has continuity and story arcs - especially this season, so it's preferable to watch in chronological order (though there's a few episodes you can watch standalone), however the DVD boxed set made the tremendous error of putting the episodes in random orders. It's an absolute mess and inexcusable that they got so careless to just stuff them in without checking how it properly goes. People not as familiar with the stories may be confused watching it, wondering what plot point they missed because of this. Despite it, a simple research online on what the right order is can save a lot of hassle and if you don't mind switching disks back and forth, then I recommend this. At least all the episodes are there. Again, do not expect any extras or subtitles; the DVD only contains the episodes, but with clear DVD-quality images.",1226534400,9,6377,4.856617647058823
