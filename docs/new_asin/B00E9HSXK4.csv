8603001,5,B00E9HSXK4,"I found the techniques mentioned in ""Guerilla Filmmaking with a Hollywood Flair"" to be thoughtful, well described and demonstrated. It was easy to put the suggestions into practice. I am using the techniques to create brief informational marketing videos. The DVD has changed the way I think and see any subject I consider filming or photographing. I'm having a lot of fun with friends and colleagues working on these projects.

The projects mentioned in the DVD were touching and inspiring. The filmmaker creates an avenue for young people to see themselves in a different light. Our love for the screen makes learning through watching a powerful tool. Great Work!!",1379203200,,666,5.110091743119266
8603002,5,B00E9HSXK4,"Guerilla Filmmaking with a Hollywood Flair provides a wealth of practical information, not only about the ""how-to's"" of low-tech filmmaking, but also about the learning process. This video offers a valuable assist to the teacher and community activist looking for creative ways to engage a wide variety of students. Connie Butler, PhD",1378857600,,334,5.4423076923076925
8603003,5,B00E9HSXK4,"This video was split into two pieces - the first being practical instruction on how to shoot good video using nine different angles, heights, and movements, along with how to interview and ""freeze"" your subject to make interesting and professional looking videos. This portion of the DVD was short, to the point, and explained very well.

I work for a small non-profit and am responsible for our marketing effort. This DVD really helped me feel comfortable with my camera and I plan on using what it taught me to make some short PSA's for our website.

The second part of this DVD is a case study with the charming Brianna. I tried to mostly pay attention to the technical parts of this documentary style case study (noticing the things I learned in the first part of the video) but found the story so interesting that I found myself swept away by the story.

I would recommend this video to anyone who has a camera and wants to create videos that are more interesting and professional-looking.",1378425600,,994,4.668571428571428
8603004,5,B00E9HSXK4,"I am a Feldenkrais Method teacher/practitioner, meaning that I help people to improve their movement and comfort by teaching them to sense/feel themselves at a deeper level and to develop new, more effective movement options.  More and more of my colleagues are using film to illustrate how this occurs in Feldenkrais.  Since film-maker Linda Flanders also happens to be a Feldenkrais practitioner, I went to her dvd to discover whether or not I felt I could do this effectively  too, or would I remain one of those 'video challenged' people?!

Linda completely exceeded my expectations in every way.  Her manner of teaching us about filming possibilities was simple, logical and easy to follow and I could even imagine myself using these techniques.  She teaches the practical elements AND the tricks of how to create interesting and successful videos.  She also clearly shows us a whole range of unexpected results that come from the process of creating the videos themselves by working with other people. And finally, we end up with a wonderful result-- a well-crafted video teaching tool that really has a professional look and feel.

Her illustrations include difficult subjects like working with teens on issues of drug, alcohol and even sexual abuse, as well as children and adults with autism  or other conditions that sometimes isolate them from the so-called normal world.  I came away with everything I wanted to learn and understand, and felt prepared to undertake doing a first approximation of video work on my own.

As a human among humans struggling to communicate meaning in an increasingly complex world, Linda has taught me to create an effective, punchy and interesting video tool.  Most important she teaches us how to use ourselves and everyday objects as our 'special' equipment, and to include the people in our world as our subjects, material and interactive collaborators -- and recipients of these lovely gifts -- working creatively together in a meaningful way.  Thanks Linda!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Guerilla-Filmmaking-with-a-Hollywood-Flair/dp/B00E9HSXK4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Guerilla Filmmaking with a Hollywood Flair</a>",1378166400,,2210,5.6006006006006
8603005,5,B00E9HSXK4,"This DVD is amazing! It covers a broad range of subjects that helps guerilla filmmakers learn creative filmmaking, such as camera angle, camera heights, camera movements, and interviewing. I believe a beginner can benefit from some great tips on how to maximize each area, and some pitfalls to watch out for. Anybody who might be afraid to start a film project will be encouraged to begin his or her own work.
As a cinema therapist (see: cinema therapy.com), I appreciate the impressive demonstration of using this digital technology to work with atypical children successfully. I learned from this DVD how communal art can become a fun project in the service of humanity.",1377216000,,672,5.008928571428571

I was fortunate to take a wonderful workshop with Linda on video production. This video is a fabulous opportunity to capture all the concise ideas and maker a helpful structure to make videos. I am now feeling better about bringing the ideas and concepts to life with the power of video for my work, clients, websites and general family fun.
Thank you for all the information in a manner that I, the amateur can be thrilled with the outcomes!!",1376265600,,505,4.872093023255814
8603007,5,B00E9HSXK4,"This DVD taught me a lot about making my home videos look really good!  I learned a lot about different camera angles, how to balance different views and about the concept of actors ""freezing"" for a change in camera angles. When I put it all together, and then added music, the video became an adventure.  No more of my boring, ""let's capture everything in real time"" videos.  I'm good to go!!",1375574400,,393,4.507042253521127
