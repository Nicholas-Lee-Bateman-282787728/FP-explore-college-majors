8262186,5,B0016DY1U0,"Extremely informative and interesting dvd, complete with great interview with The Aga Khan. Totally clarified for me the differences between the Ismailis and other Islamic sects, and a great way to learn more about Ismaili beliefs and the behind the scenes achievements of the Aga Khan Development Fund.",1322611200,2,303,5.333333333333333
8262187,5,B0016DY1U0,"Finally we can watch this wonderful film via streaming! Not normally one to agree to interviews, the Aga Khan opens up to the filmmakers in this documentary that looks at his 50-year history and the 1400-year history of his community, the Shia Ismaili Muslims. Since 9/11, Islam is often associated with extremism; it is nice to see a film that shows the other side and of Muslims doing positive and good work to bridge divides but at the same time is honest as to the schisms within the Muslim world itself. If you have ever wondered who is the Aga Khan or who are the Ismailis, this documentary is for you!

Great film! And congrats to the filmmakers!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aga-Khan-and-the-Ismailis-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B0016DLT3C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aga Khan and the Ismailis: Collector's Edition</a>",1296172800,,866,5.818897637795276
8262188,5,B0016DY1U0,Well researched and well directed video. Covers overall aspect of the Ismaili tariqah of Islam. It seems impossible to ever come across this great man and at the same time he hardly speaks. For that reason I am most thankful for the interview by the Aga Khan which includes in this video. I am truly inspired by the work of Aga Khan Development Network. Hope one day we will have a DVD on Fatimids.,1206576000,3,398,4.391891891891892
8262189,5,B0016DY1U0,"What I found most interesting, and refreshing, about this film was the attention paid to the Aga Khan's relationship to the Ismailis, rather than focusing solely on theology. The focus on the story of Prince Karim allows for an informative and accessible means of learning more about both the Aga Khan himself and the tradition as a whole. The film is very well-organized and does a nice job of detailing the development and history of the Ismaili community, especially through the discussions from professors and other speakers. Overall, it is very easy to follow while simultaneously raising complex discussions.",1206316800,6,614,5.212121212121212
8262190,5,B0016DY1U0,"I thoroughly enjoyed ""An Islamic Conscience"" and greatly benefited from its depth of factual information as well as its fresh perspective on the challenges and strengths of the Ismailis, especially since I hadn't encountered as comprehensive material on this subject before. The film kept me engaged as the story of the Ismaili community as a whole was intertwined with the very human and poignant history of the Agha Khan himself. At a time when the media generally shines its light on those elements of the Muslim community, like those found in any community, who act in violence and hate, I thought ""An Islamic Conscience"" provided important counter-example of Islam in action.",1206316800,5,680,5.135135135135135
