4436069,5,B004NJC0J8,"This movie brought back the memories of my youth, sneaking in to the drive-in on Saturday night what fun. This is kind of movie we need today simple story, fast action, cars and crashes, and no CGI!!!!!!! A flick that relies on the talent of the person not the computer...",1357430400,,272,4.46
4436070,5,B004NJC0J8,Ron Howard in two action-packed movies was totally awesome.  What more could they think of in movies like those?  Probably a lot,1353369600,,128,4.7727272727272725
4436071,4,B004NJC0J8,"This isn't a great set but interesting because it shows the embryonic stages of a great filmmaker.  Ron Howard spent most of his life on film and TV sets.  He came from an acting family.  He had a burning desire to be a director.  At the time he was playing second banana to the Fonzie fad.  He approached Roger Corman about his dream and Corman of course was willing to abide...with conditions.  He had to first star in ""Eat My Dust"" which is an OK but not really remarkable car chase flick.  About the best you can say about it is his co-star, Christopher Norris, is a real stunner in her white Daisy Dukes and thigh high go-go boots.  Corman let Howard direct ""Grand Theft Auto"" with the prerequisite that he do it on the cheap and he have a couple shots of things blowing up real good.  Despite a certain sitcom feel to the enterprise Howard demonstrates a real assuredness behind the camera with crisp storytelling and pacing.  He stages a demolition derby sequence at the end of the film that's out of this world.  Not classic but goes down smooth like an ice cream cone on a Summer day.  Look close for Howard's ""Happy Days"" director Garry Marshall as a mobster.",1309651200,11,1169,4.436619718309859
4436072,5,B004NJC0J8,"Just gotta say, they don't make cheap movies like this anymore! These two Ron Howard vehicles (pun intended) are fun from a bygone era. Grand Theft Auto being my favorite of the two, but Eat My Dust is hilarious also. Shout! has done another fantastic job on these anamorphic widescreen transfers. They don't look the greatest, but this IS the best they have ever looked on home video. Hell, listening to Ron Howard and Roger Corman commentary is worth the price alone! And to see Ron becoming the great director he is today...WOW!
This is truly my favorite double feature that perfectly compliments one another.
This is a two disc set with each movie on a disc with its own special features.
I am so happy to get these drive-in classics in anamorphic widescreen instead of full frame.
Thanks again to Shout! for putting this double feature together as they did.
Enjoy and hang on...it's a fun ride!!",1307491200,11,900,4.7025316455696204
4436073,1,B004NJC0J8,"Took a girl to the drive-in to see this one(GTA)and we couldn't believe how bad it was, so we did what we came there for anyway. But I remember us commenting on how terrible it was. You would be better off buying ""Hot Rods To Hell"". Its terrible too but its still cool.",1307145600,4,269,4.09433962264151

4436081,4,B004NJC0J8,"While the 2 movies starring Ron Howard in typical '70s car action are ok, the commentary with Ron Howard & Roger Corman in ""Grand Theft Auto"" is the main reason to enjoy this double feature (No commentary for ""Eat my Dust).",1419638400,2,223,4.463414634146342

4436094,4,B004NJC0J8,"I like both of these movies because they are decent car crash films.  I remember seeing Grand Theft Auto at the drive in.  Yes, these were never nominated for an Oscar or Academy award, but they are just fun to watch.  Just check reality at the door and enjoy.",1415836800,,260,4.26530612244898

4436102,5,B004NJC0J8,"Both of these movies feature Ron Howard and a lot of car stunts/action, believe it or not. Both movies also come with more extras and details than I expected. There are some cool interviews with Ron, his brother Clint and father Rance (both were in both movies), and Roger Corman. It was really interesting to hear how and why these movies were made and Ron using them as a launching pad for his career as a director.

Both movies are light, fun, and well made. I won't pretend that either one has incredible depth, but that isn't what you're buying a ticket for. Eat My Dust has a lot of fun stunts even though you can tell it was made on a shoestring budget. Grand Theft Auto has a lot of laughs, with some great performances by the uptight fiancee and the increasingly nutty radio DJ.",1369008000,2,787,4.390410958904109
