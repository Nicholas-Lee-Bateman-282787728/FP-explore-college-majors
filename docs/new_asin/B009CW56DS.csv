5315533,5,B009CW56DS,"WHAT GOD HATH WROUGHT is an outstanding documentary about the ""The Jesus Movement"" of the 1970s and Chuck Smith, the pastor of Calvary Chapel. Any person interested in revival should see this video that thoroughly explains how God began a revival that's still impacting the world today. The many fascinating interviews deal as much with how to please God as with the story of the revival.
Chuck Smith was raised studying the Bible and was dedicated to God by his mother. His preaching career began like many young pastors. He led several churches with some success and some failure, as measured by church growth. Chuck says God had a plan for his life and that included showing him that, without God, he could do nothing.
The Jesus Movement began with Chuck's wife not wanting to move where God desired, and Chuck not wanting much to do with ""dirty hippies."" God changed both of their hearts. Chuck wound up welcoming hippies and his message of humility and obedience captured their hearts. Soon, Chuck had a number of hip musicians creating the first contemporary Christian music. Out of this came Maranatha Records.
Calvary Chapel's style of ministry welcomed people regardless of their dress or appearance. This was not common at the time. Calvary Chapel wound up creating churches across the country and around the world to serve those who wanted sound biblical teaching and a more welcoming church
For those who lived through the 70s, this is a fascinating look at a part of their lives. For those younger, this documentary explains the origins of many of America's largest churches. Debate still rages over the change in Christian music and ministry style, but there is no debate that the Jesus Movement has brought many people to Christ and impacted the whole world.
This outstanding documentary gives tremendous insight on the history and philosophy of the Jesus Movement. This movement not only affected nondenominational churches, it also had a great impact on denominational churches, from many Baptist and Presbyterian churches to Pentecostal churches. The title WHAT GOD HATH WROUGHT aptly expresses the heart of the story, namely that this movement is a work of God more than the work of any single man or woman.",1379808000,5,2226,4.986559139784946
5315534,5,B009CW56DS,"I actually sought this out because I have a deep interest in how the church has changed its format in recent decades, rather than because I knew much about Chuck Smith or the Calvary Chapel movement.  I really appreciate Chuck Smith's heart as revealed in the in-depth interview he gives on this documentary.  He describes his years of numerous pastorates as a training period for him in learning humility, learning that he doesn't have any special secret to building a church, by seeing at least one church he pastored diminish and others expand.  He puts high emphasis on teaching through books of the Bible and on orthodox doctrine, and describes how he came to appreciate an ""expository"" (through-the-text) approach to preaching.  His ministry blossomed in Orange County, California (and an added bonus is that I currently live there and thus know the geography of the places he's talking about).

There are some issues with the movement's organization, leadership structure, and quick restoration of pastors who have been in sexual sin, which I've read about on Christianity Today on the internet, but are not covered on this documentary.  I also don't think it's been good for the church that decorum in appearance and music has been eroded as the result of this movement.  I do think that it was very wise of him to let hippies come as they were to church, but that he should have established higher standards for leadership.  I think standards have been lowered for worship around the world because he welcomed new Christians who wanted to help lead worship to dress and perform as casually and loudly as the hippie visitors who would show up.

In spite of my disapproval of some of the effects of the Calvary Chapel movement and its less than perfect accountability system, Chuck Smith clearly is a very godly person, as the in-depth interview on here strongly demonstrates, and God has really worked through the movement he began in spite of its flaws.  I enjoyed a story near the end about God opening opportunity for the Calvary Chapel movement in eastern Europe about 1990, right as the ""Iron Curtain"" was opening up.  Last of all, I enjoyed Chuck Smith's attitude about the secret of his preaching, and his attitude about the Holy Spirit.  He said his preaching is down-to-earth because he can't understand theologians' explanations, so he's just preaching in a way HE can understand!  He also says, as quoted on the back of the DVD and by his daughter, ""I didn't want to direct the Holy Spirit; I just wanted to find out how the Holy Spirit was moving and get in the boat and move with Him.""",1378339200,7,2606,4.790178571428571

5315537,5,B009CW56DS,Very fast paced and compelling. Absolutely amazing what God has done through this whole Hippie-Jesus Movement. I didn't realize that so many things that define Christianity today in terms of music and worship and dress had it's roots in this Movement. Lots of archival footage.  I especially loved all the bands from the 60's and 70's. Very well done!,1356480000,4,351,4.9491525423728815
