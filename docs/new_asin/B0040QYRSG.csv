4240741,5,B0040QYRSG,"**may contain spoilers**

One of the things I enjoyed about this obscure gem is that it avoids much of the formulaic characteristics overused by similar genre films in recent days. Even though within the narrative there clearly *is* a supernatural element at work (established early on, in fact) the film does a good job of twisting it all around by likewise establishing doubt, making the viewer question which reality is occurring: is David delusional, as his friends sort of suspect, or is he, and subsequently them as well, actually being menaced by a sinister entity?

The story unfolds as David arrives unannounced and out of sorts at his friend's apartment house, seeking comfort upon discovering that his longtime girlfriend is cheating on him. If the viewer is following closely, clues are provided suggesting David knows he's being followed by ..something unknown. Ambiguity is used effectively as there are several cryptic, yet essential bits of information the viewer is given at the onset, including erotic photographs of David's girlfriend and her lover that he finds, and the demonic unease that proceeds to overwhelm him.

What might one have to do with the other? Why is David suddenly 'seeing things' that may or may not be brought on by paranoia and psychological breakdown? How did David know to use salt in front of the doors to keep...what exactly(?)...from crossing over? Phantom noises, knocks and rappings begin to manifest, and David exclaims, ""not here,"" indicating that the presence has followed him from his home to theirs.

Wisely, more questions arise than what are ever answered throughout the totality of the film, serving to further heighten tension, anxiety, and ultimately all-out horror as David and his friends spend the night fighting off and fleeing from demons.

The Possession of David O'reilly is a genre film that fans either seem to love or hate. If you're seeking a traditional Possessed Young Girl movie, replete with a foul-mouthed, nightgown sporting teenager gnashing her teeth, growling, writhing and gesticulating wildly (I always suspected that genuine evil would be more intelligent and far trickier than wasting time with such nonsense, but I digress), than The Possession of David O'reilly may not for you. To be fair, there are a few missed opportunities. The film's makers maybe could've fleshed out a few of the background and peripheral bits of mysterious data to slightly better effect...although really, it's because the viewer is left only knowing David's side of the story that contributes to the sense of unease and dread.",1357862400,5,2587,5.164677804295943
4240742,2,B0040QYRSG,"No ""possession"" in this film and the first 30 minutes are pretty good. However, you should NEVER show ""the evil thing""--that's why BLAIR WITCH and PARANORMAL ACTIVITY remain so successful/creepy--like them or not.

And when men ""scream"" or ""cry out in terror"" it sounds pretty lame. Better to let the ladies be terrified or tormented.",1320537600,,334,5.072727272727272
4240743,1,B0040QYRSG,"This move doesn't compare to Paranormal Activity or even anything on the Sy-Fi channel. It was simply an awful movie, doesn't anyone put any effort into horror films anymore what a waste of time.

This shouldn't even rate one star",1317427200,,230,4.75
4240744,1,B0040QYRSG,"Movie was horrible.  Got sucked in by the description on the DVD box.  It's been a very, very long time since I saw a movie that I actually hated and yelled at while watching it.  Acting is fine, but the whole build to the climax is maddening because the people in the film are complete idiots.  In one scene, creepy noises and visuals freak them out of their flat into the hallway.  The front door to the OUTSIDE is five feet away, but instead they hightail it upstairs where it is dark and vacant and hello?.... what scared moron would choose to run up the stairs deeper into the house instead of outside?  Even better---after a night of terror that they survived, you'd think the first thing they want to do is GO OUTSIDE away from the creepy house.  But no.  They go back into the flat, hang out and then the next thing you know it is night again and more crazy stuff happens.  Idiots.  Couldn't stop myself from yelling at them for their stupidity.  Don't waste your time unless you want the challenge of trying to sit through the film without making a comment!",1308787200,,1066,4.387755102040816
4240745,4,B0040QYRSG,"The movie slowly builds up. It starts out with a young couple Alex and Kate watching TV. She talks in her sleep, ""Don't open it."" Alex wakes her and they laugh about it. Then the doorbell rings. It is quarter past midnight...as it turns out it is their friend David O'Reilly who brings no luggage, but a lot of emotional baggage. His girlfriend Sarah has left him. He had found some photos of her posing on a bed. Who took them? It must be her lover. David and Alex stay up talking. David is very annoying with his cigarette puffs, long pauses, rocking motion, and dowdy appearance. David doesn't want to sleep. He sees glimpses of demons in the corner of his eye. Later the visions become more pronounced as David starts acting more psychotic, having flash backs. Eventually the whole household is in an uproar as David sleep walks and now is carrying around a knife. Soon Alex starts to see glimpses of the creatures that David now sees plainly while Kate still sees nothing. David shows all the signs of a psychotic who just murdered his girlfriend and is dually suffering from sleep deprivation, who has sucked in his friend Alex with the power of suggestion. But is that the case? I watched the whole thing and I still don't know.

I thought the movie was better than Paranormal Activity, but then what wasn't. It is not filmed as a documentary type film, although much of the scenes take place at night and in poorly lit areas. I am not sure what these people did during daylight hours as it they must be living in the part of England that gets only one hour of light a day (similar to vampire films). The acting was better than most with Giles Alderson giving us a convincing performance as David.

No sex. No nudity. This is a great movie to watch in the dark right before bed time.",1290211200,17,1790,4.454268292682927
4240766,2,B0040QYRSG,"I'm going to give it one extra point for the acting which was fairly good and the camera work which gave it almost a documentary feel.  However, as the badass ninja master of horror film watching, I was less than impressed.  There were so many disparate elements that never came together.

Flashes of newspaper articles relating heinous crimes - check.
Ouija board style communication - check.
Fat dude in a rubber demon suit with lots of blood - check.

None of it seemingly related to the other.  They had phones.  It is also my understanding that they have a police force in England.  You use one to get the other when your friend is in your apartment ranting about THEM and sleepwalking with a kitchen knife.

If you want to see a really good horror movie, check out ""Babadook"".  Now THAT is the way horror is done.  Also for a darker take on the genre please see ""Lovely Molly"".",1462579200,,883,4.49685534591195

4240768,2,B0040QYRSG,Watched this based on the reviews.  Major disagreement.  Bad movie.  Why the hell didn't they just call the police?  Leave two nights earlier when David was acting batsh*t crazy?  Why didn't they just go outside the first evening or the first day and yell 'Help!'?  Stupid movie.  Liked their apartment though.  Nice place.,1451347200,2,323,4.962264150943396

4240770,5,B0040QYRSG,Excellent movie. Great concept and different take on a simple idea. Highly recommended to movie buffs that enjoy a scary/make you think-kind of movie.,1436659200,3,150,5.291666666666667
4240771,5,B0040QYRSG,"I really like this movie because it is absolutely unique in its story telling, granted it is a ""found footage"" style horror film, but this aside it is absolutely original. I am not surprised that this movie got so many negative reviews, I can honestly say is not for everyone, this film in many ways has a style of horror, which is similar to Lovecraftian Horror. Its about those things that exist alongside us unseen, and did long before we crawled out of the evolutionary goo, and once you see them they see you.
The imagery in this movie, simply, is unsettling in a very ""Unnatural way"", again much like in Lovecrafts description, or not descriptions in his stories, it is not so much the accuracy of what is being seen by the protagonist, but how unnatural, strange and absolutely bizarre the entity actually is, as far as what exists in our normal world.
This film, has a pretty complex idea, as well as synopsis, which may take a second viewing to pick up on. Though don't get me wrong, it is not as obtuse and confusing as lets say ""Enemy"" or ""Under the Skin"", but it may not be obvious to most viewers, which is why I think it has gotten its fair share of negative reviews.
This is a hard movie to describe without giving something away, and quite honestly it is a movie, which you should go into with only the knowledge you get from the trailer. If you are a horror fan, especially the kind which likes more cerebral, lovecraftian, or perhaps even Asian style horrors, I will be surprised if you don't at least like this movie let alone find yourself pondering over it after you have watched it!
Give it a watch see what you think!",1426723200,4,1640,4.433774834437086
4240772,1,B0040QYRSG,Not a very good movie. It as nothing to do about demon,1409097600,,54,3.5833333333333335
4240773,5,B0040QYRSG,"I first saw this film on one of the cable channels, but only the last 30 minutes of it, and could never find it again. But, it intrigued me enough to want to purchase it.  Now that I have it in my collection, I can say I'm not at all disappointed I did. It is not one of those exploitation films with blood and gore. I would say it is more on the creepy side. At first, you think the main character, David, is slowly going insane. You only see glimses of the ""monsters"" David is so afraid of and the other two don't ever really see them. Plus, all of the hysteria created by David, causes two of the three people to kill each other.  But by the end , it made a believer of me. It is one of the most creepy and scary films I've seen in a long time; and I've been a horror fan all my life. I highly recommend this one; particularly on a rainy night, in a dark room, with a couple friends and a large bowl of popcorn!!",1362873600,4,915,3.913978494623656
4240774,4,B0040QYRSG,"The movie was weak, and sometimes confusing and hard to follow.  Was the images of shadows only in David mind, or did his friends actually see these images of shadows too. Persuasive thought implemcations.",1361923200,,205,5.029411764705882
4240775,5,B0040QYRSG,"""The Possession of David O Reilly"" has to be one of the most effective low budget movies I have ever seen.  Giles Anderson, director of ""Taken"" and a few other blockbuster films gives one of the most convincing (and brave) performances from a male actor that one could hope for.  If you've ever wondered why films about demonic possession almost always feature young girls as the vulnerable, soon-to-be-possessed vessels of the demonic, this movie is your antidote.

David, a tall and looming young man, shows up at his two friend's houses (Alex and Kate) distressed about recent (perceived? real?) developments in his relationship with a girl named Sarah.  He has, apparently, discovered photos of her naked with another man.  The couple are sympathetic to him and offer him a room for the night to recover from his romantic fallout.  Big mistake.

For reasons that are never made clear to the viewer, David notices a slight sound in his room and says emphatically, ""Not here, please.""  This is the start of either some vicious possession or, most likely, the most convincing nervous breakdown I have ever seen on camera, as David finds himself unable to sleep and is absolutely convinced that he and his friends are under attack from some invisible entity.  The power of suggestion (or a real presence?) is enough to make his friend Alex follow his lead in absolute panic, turning off the lights and even allowing David to run amuck with a large butcher knife in his hand.  While some of this sounds unrealistic (why don't they subdue and drive him to the nearest psychiatric hospital?) you can actually see it occurring if two people were unprepared for a seemingly normal man to lose his s*** in the scariest way possible.  If he never had problems like this before, where is it coming from and why?  The viewer runs from room to room with David and the hapless couple, seeing either his hallucinations or what is actually a demonic presence.  Needless to say, really, this does not end well.  David's notebooks, filled with scrawls of demons and other languages, suggests that this might have been going on for longer than one night.

This is like a hyper caffeinated madcap rush of ""Paranormal Activity"" without the pacing.  In contrast to most viewers, I found this viscerally terrifying and would recommend it to any fan of the horror genre.",1361318400,5,2349,4.835

It feels great to find something not found footage! No contrived reasons for everything being filmed. No night vision. No sitting through a spread out hours worth of kevin smith style, everyone just hangin out scenes, to get ten total minutes of huge fail at movie making.

This gem has done what ive seen in only one other film, another kind, and might have even done it better. ""Flashlight mode"". Mostly pitch dark screen with a small amount of moving light. What those two films did that actually made it special was that you kept waiting for a jump scare that never happened. It really cranks up the tension for me. Where this did it better, ""another kind"" the characters were actually using flashlights. This flick used the camera light so YOU could see, but it wasn't part of the characters world. They were in pitch black. So when the focus is on a character and you see something creeping in the background, they only hear it.

Pretty original and creative story. The acting was good. As i expect from non found footage. I was pretty impressed by the realistic panic and wailing of all three main actors. The creature effects ranged from really good for what was probably a low budget to whoa i don't know if ive ever seen anything that creepy. Some of the sound effects were awesome as well. All elements combined makes for good immersion.

SPOILER TALK**************

I like that the title is misleading. I expected the usual, hit all the same beats, possession movie. The only reason i even watched this is because i couldn't ever remember seeing a possession movie where a man was the victim. Turns out i still haven't seen one but im glad i got this instead. The only complaints i have are that they never showed the laptop security programs footage, they couldve at least shown it during the credits, and the final scene. If it were my film, i wouldve had her walk into the hallway to find several different of the monsters, not clearly visible but the best view you ever get, just standing there, poised to attack. As opposed to just showing her dead and her failure to unlock the door. So yea, good flick for me.",1473465600,3,2143,4.584856396866841
