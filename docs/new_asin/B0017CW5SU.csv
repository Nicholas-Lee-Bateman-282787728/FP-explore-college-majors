8265743,1,B0017CW5SU,The video was not even the right one.  The one that did come in the package was not even playable.  It was a different movie all together and had a scratch on it.,1385510400,,162,3.878787878787879

It reminds one of sleeping with the enemy.  The plot was great.",1306886400,,165,4.466666666666667
8265745,3,B0017CW5SU,"These films are not great by any means.  They are not excellent thrillers, they are not free from cliches, they are not good movies, but that doesn't mean they can't be enjoyable.  Enjoying trash has a validation for great films and even good films.  But what these two films are entertaining in their way.  Though Jade is accredited with fall of David Caruso's acting career and reduced him to CSI: Miami.  And Bless the Child did nothing for Kim Bassingers career.  Jade was written by pulp writer Joe Eszterhas and Bless the Child was written by three writers one of which was probably more known and stays better known for his television writing.  For the low price that Amazon is offering these two movies, the offer is wonderful, and you shouldn't hesitate in grabbing them up.

But, because the movies aren't great, I couldn't bring myself to give the films five stars.  However, the price is definitely a five star price for what you get.  You can enjoy these products, and have fun with them.",1267488000,2,1001,4.668571428571428

8265747,3,B0017CW5SU,"I was dissapointed when the DVD came in the mail. It was listed as widescreen, but when I got it open, I found out that the film I wanted, JADE, was fullscreen and the other film was widescreen. Just a heads up for others that are going to buy this. On the other hand, this is the only copy of JADE I can find that you don't have to pay an arm and a leg, so it's okay for now. Still a bit dissapointed though.",1250121600,20,409,3.823529411764706
