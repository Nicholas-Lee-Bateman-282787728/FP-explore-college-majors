1711615,5,B000066735,Dragon Ball Z is the best. I t has the best Graphics and the best animation. The fighting is the best and It really pumps you up!!!,1034035200,,131,3.888888888888889
1711616,5,B000066735,"This is one of the best releases for Dragonball Z's Buu saga.  Featured is the fusion of Goku and Vegita into Vegito.
This release features 4 episodes.  All four of them have the clash between Majin Buu with absorbed powers vs. Vegito.  Eipisode one features getting to know Vegito/his power.  Episode two is more like a definition of supremecy.  Episode three features Buu finding a ""tactic"", and episode 4 has Buu's tactics backfiring... well... sort of.  THe final episode takes an ""unlikely"" turn as well.
I recommend picking this one up.  Of all the releases and features, this is definitly a DBZ that you will want to own and watch again and again - if anything, for the hilarious one liners.",1032134400,5,698,4.7190082644628095
1711617,5,B000066735,"Chances are this DVD will be the only one with Vegitto.  If this is the case you must pick it up.  After evil Boo absorbed fat Boo, Piccolo, Goten, Trunks, and Gohan he appeared to be unstoppable.  Now Goku senses Vegita's energy, and he wants to use the Potera earrings to fuse!  Unlike the fusion dance this is permanent, and Vegita tries his hand at Boo first.  After failing he gives in and Vegitto is formed.  The imbalance of power caused is comical.  Boo's bottomless energy is useless against the combined strength of the two most powerful beings in the universe.  He's beating Boo and he's not even a Super Saiya-Jin yet!",1019088000,3,630,4.5625
7961846,5,B000066735,"I am glad to see that the 4:3 or original version of DBZ is still sold.
Here the english voices are not re-dubbed ( they re-dubbed the voices of majin buu in the orange brick version which is cropped, etc), and the disc offers the original japanese cast.",1392940800,,254,4.3125
7961847,5,B000066735,"After merging, Vegeto is able to go toe to toe with Buu. Buu uses his candy beam to turn Vegeto into chocolate. This seems weird, but just wait until they get swallowed.",1355702400,,169,4.3125
7961848,5,B000066735,"HE'S HERE!  One of the coolest Dragonball Z characters arrives, and is about to kick some major pink monster @$$!!  Goku and Vegeta have fused, and now Vegito is born!  I only have one thing to say, Buu's in deep saiyajin doo-doo!  Of course, the battle hardly ends here, and the ending takes a shocking turn for the worse.... let's just say that the tide seems to turn in Buu's favor!  Oh, and the last episode is hilarious!  Vegito gets turned into a piece of candy!  But he still keeps on fighting Majinn Buu!  I have one thing to say, Mr. Toriyama has a weird sense of humor!  Weird, but good!  So, all DBZ fans really need to check this volume out, because Goku and Vegeta's other fusion, Gogeta, won't show up until about 2005(in DBZ that is, he'll show up in DBGT probably soon)!",1067904000,3,786,4.358620689655172
7961849,3,B000066735,"We finally get to see Vegetto, it is okay, he is pretty powerful and theres some action, but there is one big flaw.
Vegetto needs to stop playing around with Buu and just destroy him. Every episode is Vegetto saying some stupid catch phrase and then waiting for Buu to attack. Akira Toriyama really should have ended this series with Vegetto, and not have Vegetto just play around for tons of episodes. I mean cmon, one kamehameha or spirit bomb could have killed buu in seconds, but instead Vegetto had to ruin that by just do nothing. He did some stuff, there were some cool explosions, but nothing serious really.",1042070400,2,616,4.609090909090909
7961850,4,B000066735,everyone who have seen dragonball Z up to this point know that Goku and Vageta are one of the most powerful fighters in the known universe. or course this is besides Buu. now imagine the fused Goku and Vageta fighting BUU. Vegeto instantly proves that hes powerful before he even goes SSJ. anyone who has been following the eposodes needs this one. there is only a few left till the whole series is over. if you are a newbie...start from the begining because you will be confused.,1040169600,3,480,4.528735632183908
7961851,5,B000066735,"These Majin Buu episodes are the latest Funimation dubs being aired on Cartoon Network as of November 02.  Anyway in these episodes Vegeto is born.  He becomes Saiyajin and puts up a great fight.  Then he gets turned to candy and gets absorbed.
  I love DBZ.  I can't wait to see the end of the Kid Buu saga!  :)",1037232000,2,312,4.186440677966102
