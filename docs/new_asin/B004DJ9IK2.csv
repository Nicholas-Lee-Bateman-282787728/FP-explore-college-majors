4332577,5,B004DJ9IK2,I watched this video with my family.......And almost shed tears from wonderful memories........as a child in the lower east side of NYC...it was almost like re-living those wonderful times...with all the street games that we all played..and it didn't cost us a nickle...Only our time...and ripped jeans at our knees..........,1303948800,,325,5.52
4332578,5,B004DJ9IK2,"No matter where I live, I'll always and all ways be a New Yorker. I lived in the Bronx on a street with about 30 kids. These are the games we played until the summer light failed or our mothers called us in from the street. I bought 5 copies of this wonderful piece of nostalgia to give to my siblings. The price was right and amazon has proven again that it offers what I want to own.",1302134400,3,385,3.948717948717949

4332580,5,B004DJ9IK2,"I bought this documentary called Steet Games for my husband for Christmas. We both grew up in Brooklyn in the 70's. This movie brought back alot of great memories. It was a wonderful movie, even my kids liked it. I don't think we'll ever see kids play outside like we did. The transaction was great with this seller, Thank You",1293667200,,326,4.45
4332581,1,B004DJ9IK2,"I purchased this item because I grew up in the Bronx and was anxious to see some of the games I played as a child. Unfortunately, I didn't play this disc before I invited people over from my old neighborhood to watch it. It would skip, freeze, skip and freeze at the same time and as a result the night was ruined.",1292284800,,314,4.080645161290323
4332582,5,B004DJ9IK2,"Being a Native New Yorker who was a child in the 50's, I thoroughly enjoyed ""New York Street Games"".  The video is excellent, the commentaries by all my fellow ""New Yawkuhs"" are so familiar.  I'm thankful to be have been able to enjoy my childhood playing street games and getting plenty of good exercise and having good, clean fun.  Jumping double-dutch was it for me and my friends.  Hopscotch, skellys, red light green light 1-2-3, Spaldeens, etc.  Kids today, unfortunately, have no idea what real fun is.  Hey, New Yawkuhs, buy this video--you will love it!",1284768000,3,562,4.802083333333333
4332583,4,B004DJ9IK2,"As an old New yorker who played most of these games, this was a great trip down memory lane.
They were so much fun it's sad to think today's kids are missing out on the fun.

4332585,5,B004DJ9IK2,"It brought back so many memories of how we lived, laughed and played as we grew up.  No tv, video games, cellphones, etc.  We played outdoors all day and created so many wonderful games, interacting with other kids of all ages instead of a TV robot. We did not walk around with earphones stuck in our ears.  We were involved, but I was never able to conquer ""double dutch"" jump rope!  I brought this DVD in to the local assisted living facility.  Since their attention span is not long enough for the whole movie, I broke it up into parts, and were they delighted! When I would turn it off, they began talking and laughing about the places they recognized as where they grew up, and told stories of the things they did and the games they played.  What a wonderful gift for anyone older than 50/55, especially if they grew up in NYC.",1278547200,2,832,4.37012987012987
4332586,5,B004DJ9IK2,"Anyone who grew up on or near urban streets in the northeast will really relate to this movie. Most people who grew up before video games, cable TV, and computers will probably relate to this movie. This would probably prove to be boring to younger viewers (too much black and white video), though it would give them a good look at how kids played long before technology. Usually, a pink Spalding ball was involved. Or bottle caps. Or tops. We gathered together with no umpires or referees. We agreed upon rules. We played with whomever was available and everyone played. As a group, we didn't tolerate cheating. We learned how to win and we learned how to lose. We got sweaty and dirty and bounced from one game to the next. We reported home for meals, then went back out again. We didn't worry about child molesters because we played in packs.

We talked trash and related events while we played and rested. We made fun of each other and laughed.

All this without any parental involvement.

This video will either remind you about those times or teach you about them.",1277424000,10,1070,4.591623036649215

4332592,5,B004DJ9IK2,"As a native New Yorker I consider this documentary an essential gift basket of memories. I played those street games every day of my childhood, and they were building blocks of a life I'm proud of. I've found that you may leave New York at some point, but New York never leaves you. New Yorkers, all of us, have something in common that we may have overlooked all these years. In every neighborhood, on every block, we played Street Games. And we are the better for it.",1427328000,4,469,4.402298850574713
4332593,5,B004DJ9IK2,What a wonderful film!  I am so lucky to have grown up in NYC during the 60/70's and this relived lots of wonderful memories for me.  I highly recommend this for anyone growing up during that time.  What a shame kids nowadays can't play like we did.,1425686400,2,249,4.25531914893617
4332594,5,B004DJ9IK2,A must for anyone who grew up in the northeast. Also something to show your kids and grandkids how we amused ourselves. Thoes were great days which will never be repeated.,1423267200,,171,4.548387096774194

4332597,2,B004DJ9IK2,"This had some interesting material about games like stick ball, and NYC versions of tag and hide-and-seek. It shows a boy's world, though, and throughout most of the documentary the girls stay on the sidelines. Not all of it, but the vast majority. I would have liked to hear more about variants on hopscotch and jump rope, especially Double-Dutch.

There's also a lot of pompous moralizing about ""Kids These Days,"" rehashing the stereotype that modern children are too addicted to their electronics to do anything but stare at a screen. The video wants you to come away with the idea that in the good old days when kids played on the street, they got plenty of exercise and social engagement, while nowadays kids do nothing but sit. There's something this, but reality is a little more complicated than that. Kids now have all kinds of organized activities they didn't have fifty years ago. No, it's not quite the same thing. But if I remember correctly, taxpayers and charities have been funding after-school activities for decades because of the perceived need to ""keep kids off the streets."" Yet this documentary so dewy-eyed with nostalgia, you could almost forget the charming street urchins it shows are the same boys who would later become famous for their street gangs.

In all, I found the games themselves interesting. But the content leaned too heavily towards boys' games, and I could have done without the finger wagging.",1420761600,,1435,4.925619834710743

4332602,5,B004DJ9IK2,"Every New Yorker who was a street kid in the 50's or 60's needs to own this blast of nostalgia. It's true, childhood will never be the same. The rough and tumble life of us 'Gutter Urchins' can hardly be explained in this molly-coddling time when a child can't be allowed to play at anything that might result in the use of a band-aid. Maybe this DVD will inspire some parents who remember how much fun there was to start up a stick-ball game with their kids. Right out in the street where it belongs.",1390867200,3,501,4.28421052631579
4332603,5,B004DJ9IK2,"I played every one of these games growing up in the 50's and 60's (Coney Island Ave). I have tried
to explain games like stoop ball, box baseball and skelsy to non New Yorkers and they look at you like you're crazy. Brought back a lot of memories and helped to show my friends what I was trying to explain to them. They couldn't envision
stoop ball cause they don't know what a stoop is. Anyway, I really enjoyed the
DVD.",1383177600,,421,4.209876543209877

4332609,4,B004DJ9IK2,Realistic for the times. Some games were widely played and some were specific to the neighborhoods (speaking as one who grew up in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn in the 40's).

4332618,5,B004DJ9IK2,"I grew up in the Kingsbridge neighborhood of the Bronx, and playing games in the street was a part of my everyday life growing up.  From Skelzes, to off the point, to handball, and slugs(ACE KING QUEEN), stickball, and stolen bases.  Kids these days just stay home with a video game controller in their hands.  It's just not the same.  I had the honor to go to the NYC Premiere of the film and everyone for Dr. C. Everett Koop, to Rosie Perez gave it a standing ovation.  Great film.  Thanks to Matt Levy and the rest of the folks involved in this film.  I took my dad to the Premiere and he absolutely loved it.  I wouldn't hesitate to pick this up.

8425388,4,B004DJ9IK2,"Fails to mention that kids would search for used brooms and mop sticks in the garbage to make them bats for stickball.  Black tapes was used on one side of the bat to get a better grip.  If brooms and/or mop sticks were too long we would utilize the round sewers to cut them shorter.  The chips on the ball was 25 cents.  From the bronx I never noticed the word hi-bounce written below Spalding.  The game ""Down the river"" Off the wall, Errors, was not mentioned.  Had former actor/director Gary Marshall (father of Actress/director Penney Marshall) been alive he would have alot to contribute since he resided on 207th street in the Bronx.  Today you go to the Bronx and people are playing handball with a blue ball,  Big mistake. I gave it 4 stars not 5.  Please correct  your error.  David.",1474761600,,793,4.475524475524476
