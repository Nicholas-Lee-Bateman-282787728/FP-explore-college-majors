8207100,5,B000SZ92PQ,"Sri Siva's personal transformation program touches sound ancient techniques that work rapidly to bring about a change in the person's life.
His method of teaching is parallel with others from ancient cultures, which were never before made available to the public. I hope he will continue to share his knowledge with people, and create smaller programs, such as CD's and booklets at reasonable prices. The draw back of this course, is its price. Being an author and teacher myself, I fully endorse Sri Siva's work.
