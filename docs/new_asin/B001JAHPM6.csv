8312620,5,B001JAHPM6,If the two previous posters would have read the description before ordering they would have realized that this particular DVD would not play in DVD players in the US or Canada unless it is a region free DVD player. Amazon does have  Black Sheep Squadron/ Baa Baa Black Sheep DVDs that are made for US and Canada DVD players which I have and they are wonderful quality.,1463616000,,368,4.492537313432836
8312621,1,B001JAHPM6,"It would have been nice if I could have wached the video on one of my devices.  The video I was sent came from over seas, and would not play in this region.  I would like to order Black Sheep Squadron volume two from amazon, but not if it can't be played on my devices.

8312624,4,B001JAHPM6,"I am wondering when Universal Studios is going to release Black Sheep Squadron - Season 1, aka Baa Baa Black Sheep - Vol 3?? I already own Volumes 1 & 2 and I would love to see the rest of the series, sooner then later. So Universal Studios if you are reading this, please pull your finger out, because I am not getting any younger!!",1255910400,18,333,4.138461538461539
