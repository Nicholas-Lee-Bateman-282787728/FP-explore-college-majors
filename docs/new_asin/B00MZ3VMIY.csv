After getting it in the mail I couldn't wait to watch it. Was a bit disappointed that this DVD set was recorded 20+ years ago. A lot of the information can still be applied to parenting but I was looking for guidance on electronics, etc. Still worth watching but an updated version would greatly appreciated. The package was delivered quickly and was in great condition.",1503360000,,537,4.434343434343434
