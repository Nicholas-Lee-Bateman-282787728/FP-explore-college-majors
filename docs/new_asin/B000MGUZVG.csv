8169074,5,B000MGUZVG,Jay is an icon in bodybuilding.  His well mannered attitude and honest feedback is much appreciated and it shows in this video.  His story is unique and his drive is unmatched.  If you like bodybuilding you will like this DVD even if you think jay cutler is a football player!,1504742400,,276,4.48
8169075,4,B000MGUZVG,"This is a cool first DVD from Jay Cutler - you get 80 minutes of footage showing his workout splits (nice nostalgic late-90s clothing including the spandex pants and the boxer boots made by Otomix), with a lot of voice-overs that detail other info about his cycles of diet on and off season, and a lot of other info about himself and his background.  It amazed me to hear how much protein he eats (300g per day and on up to 600g) and how the carbs fluctuate (he does low days of 50g or less or high days of 1000g...) and it was also interesting that he prefers what he calls shock training or ""sloppy training"", which explains why he seems to like cheat reps quite a bit.  Whatever gets the work done on the muscles and makes them grow and develop.  I also have the 2004 Ripped To Shreds DVD which is 2 discs, definitely enjoy that one but he didn't mention the ""sloppy but controlled' there.

I also like this DVD since it is a time when he still had a more ""aesthetic"" look with a good V-shape and hadn't yet developed that HGH-gut that so many bodybuilders seem to have these days.  I also kind of miss the way gyms used to look back then, and as much as I like the granite palaces we train in today, it's nice to see the more cozy atmosphere that Golds gyms had 15 years ago.  The only thing that can be annoying is some of the music that suddenly punches in here and there (although a lot of incidental noise in the gym during filming includes whatever music was playing naturally at the time, too).  But overall it's a good DVD... I guess I just kind of wish it were a bit longer considering the $40 price.",1429920000,,1612,4.214285714285714

8169077,3,B000MGUZVG,"Oprah once said that Brad doesn't like to talk about his looks.  He stays focused on promoting a film or a cause; he never says, ""Look how hot I am!""  Similarly, here Jay Cutler talks about his gym routine.  He never once says, ""Look at how hot I am!"" even though surely that's what many viewers are thinking.  He spends the first 8 minutes fully clothed, so he does tease you a bit.  I'm so used to seeing bodybuilders posing onstage that to see one practicing in a kitchen was unique.  Jay has a low, manly voice to match his Herculean body.  There is an extras section that is nothing but an imitation of MTV's ""Cribs.""  Although his house looks huge, he showcases only about 3 rooms which make it seem like he's in an apartment.  This DVD was probably designed for people who want to bodybuild, rather than people who lust after bodybuilders.  Still, Mr. Cutler is delicious eye candy and I was entertained watching this despite being more likely to lift a doughnut, rather than a barbell.",1259884800,,993,4.4972067039106145
