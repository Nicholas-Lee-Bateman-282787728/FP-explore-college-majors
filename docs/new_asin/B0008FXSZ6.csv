2259207,5,B0008FXSZ6,"I just suggested this to another parent, and when I saw the reviews had to add that I think its excellent.  My 17 month old loves this video and I do as well.  Lots of well known artists reworking their hits around the letters in the alphabet, but the really fabulous part is the classics included as a bonus.  Parents may remember the wanted M who tries to mascarade as a W to avoid the fuzz, the zippy, zippy zing, zing Z, Darling daughter (do daisies have feet? ducks do have ears but they don't do the dishes), and the aforementioned we all live in a capital I song.

Steven Colbert is hilarious as the depressive, angsty letter Z.  This is an all around great dvd.",1137628800,3,669,4.277777777777778
2259208,4,B0008FXSZ6,My 21 month old son is a huge Sesame Street fan.  He loves letters and numbers (I'm sure it is due to Sesame Street).  I was kind of shocked when I saw that this video didn't have very good reviews so I decided to share my opinion.  My son absolutely loves this video.  He puts it on several times a day.  It may just be because he loves letters but he really enjoys this DVD!!,1132876800,2,377,3.973333333333333
2259209,1,B0008FXSZ6,"I have a 16 month old and a 6 year old.  At the beginning of the DVD it is quite boring and the kids have no interest at all.  The letter A starts with Elmo singing a song and the kids are interested again.  I guess because it says ""All Star"" in the title, I assumed it would have more actors/Sesame Street characters in it.  The Special ""All Star"" guests were only on 6 of the letters (Sheryl Crow, Melissa Etheridge, Norah Jones, Larry King, Martie Maguire, Natalie Pasdar and Emily Robinson- I don't know who the last 3 even are).  The Sesame Street Characters were on about 5 of the letters and some with hte actors.  My kids had no interest and both love watching Sesame Street videos all the time.  My 16 month old loves watching the ""Sing Yourself Silly"" DVD over and over.  I think this DVD was thrown together and didn't have much thought put into it at all.  I know I wish I could return it at this point because it was a waste of money.  Nobody wants to watch it.",1127865600,15,974,4.188172043010753
2259210,3,B0008FXSZ6,"I rated this video three stars, which is amazing because I generally want everything from Sesame Street to have 5 stars!  We bought it today in hopes that it would be a good way to introduce the alphabet, and I must say I was very disappointed that we chose this for our 16 month old.  It isn't a bad video, but it is best suited for older children - maybe 3 and up.  There isn't that much Elmo, which would be okay. My child will sit and watch most Sesame videos from start to finish, but understandably he began wandering away after the first 15 minutes and continued to do so throughout the show. Mostly there is the letter ""A"" and ""Z"" doing interviews and some celebrities adapting some of their songs to the letters (ex. ""I wants to soak up the sun"").  No Sesame Street video is ever a bad buy, but just beware it isn't typical video and isn't really geared toward toddlers.  The songs they put together were really catch, but I would be a little concerned that some of the sarcastic humor of ""A"" and ""Z"" would be lost on little ones.  Then again, if you are looking for an out of the ordinary Sesame Street video, this might be for you.  If not, I would suggest the Sesame Street Anniversary Video or Elmo's World - The Street We Live On.",1127692800,6,1244,4.268085106382979
2259230,5,B0008FXSZ6,My 4.5 year old stepson asks to watch this video all the time. I thought he might get bored of it eventually but he continues to love it. It has helped him to advance his knowledge of the alphabet tremendously as well.,1420329600,,218,4.214285714285714
2259231,4,B0008FXSZ6,My son (2 yrs) loves the overall story. The cartoons/songs in between introducing each letter was a little boring for him but he will likely appreciate when he's a little older.,1419724800,,177,4.741935483870968

2259234,5,B0008FXSZ6,This was a DVD that our son and daughter  (who are now 9 and 7) loved when they were each 2 years old. We wanted it for our other children who are now tht age. We love the music and fun that this DVD brings with learning the alphabet!,1410134400,,234,3.7755102040816326
2259235,5,B0008FXSZ6,Both of my kids love this! My older one loved it as a toddler and my one year old watches it intently and is starting to sing his ABCs,1387065600,,134,3.6551724137931036
2259236,5,B0008FXSZ6,"My son absolutely loves this video, he's probably watched it 50 times!  A nice variety of guest performers are used.",1370649600,,116,4.8
2259237,5,B0008FXSZ6,"This is a great video and as a mom who has listened to it hundreds of time (literally over the past 8 years) I could still listen to it. ( I bought it in 2005 for my eldest and now my youngest still loves it)  All 4 of my kids love the songs (Ages 9-3) I can play it in the car without fights. -  their favorite ""jumping J"" mine- ""BBB"" by the Dixie chicks and ""Y"" ( Norah Jones).  Be warned- not all letters get the same treatment-  some have great songs, some have muppet skits and some just get a short mention/ sesame street clip.  The movie is hosted by the Letter A (Nicolle Sullivan) and the Letter Z (Stephen Colbert- yes) who interview kids in our local NJ mall. Poor Z is feeling unloved as her realizes A is much more popular until A points out his strength as ""a great closer"".  A nice little message.  Adults will recognize some of the tunes from Sheryl Crow (Soak up the Sun) and Norah Jones, Melissa Ethridge & Dixie Chicks. And my kids have totally learned the ABC's to Elmos Alphabet rap tune.  Overall a great addition to your DVD library.",1366675200,,1056,4.193069306930693
2259238,5,B0008FXSZ6,"Thanks to this video my 2 yearl old son, knows his letter and recognizes them. He can't get enough, he watches it at least once a day",1360713600,,133,3.962962962962963
2259239,5,B0008FXSZ6,We had this on DVD when my son was little and got it on Instant Video for my 2.5 year old daughter.  THEY LOVE IT!!,1354147200,,115,3.6
2259279,5,B0008FXSZ6,My 22 month old LOVES this! The stars in it make it enjoyable for me to watch! This is a great purchase!,1332374400,,104,3.772727272727273
2259280,4,B0008FXSZ6,"We were introduced to this video when my 22-month-old was in the hospital.  He was on nonstop Elmo videos during that time to keep him from messing up his IV.  He LOVED the All-Star Alphabet video-- it turned out to be his favorite, despite the fact that there was very little Elmo in the video.  He was especially fond of the letter Z (played by Stephen Colbert) and now points out Zs whenever he sees them.  He learned a couple of other letters from the video as well.",1330992000,,470,4.306818181818182
2259281,5,B0008FXSZ6,"My son started reciting his alphabet at 11 months. And then writing them at 1 and half. We thought he had autism (doesn't)so ED came in and worked with him. They were in shock that a little guy his age could write and read. He is obsessed with the alphabet. A little more then dad and I would like but hey if that is his passion then that is his passion. We are always buying alphabet dvd's and toys for him. He loves this dvd because of the music. Another passion of his. The music is easy on the ears and fun for kids. I like how they go over each letter and make it special. Plus the dvd is kind of funnny with the constant battle between A and the letter Z.  Other alphabet dvd's that are good are Inky Star alphabet. Which is really good for kids under two or even small infants kind of like baby einstein. It has music and goes over each letter. Also Elmo has another with grover and they go over each letter too. Another fun one is Blues Clues Alphabet Power(older kids may like). Tips: my husband starting singing the alphabet to my son since he was born. Every night before bed. He did it to get him to fall asleep because we thought it was a boring monotone song. But over time it just sort of stimulated his brain keeping him awake. He is now obsessed. I believe any child can learn early with determination just like reading. It's not something I push on my child, if anything he pushes it on me. LOL But kids can get discouraged if pushed too hard. And it may not be their passion. I love kids and believe everyone is good at something. I believe God has gifted every person with something their good at. Never get discouraged just keep searching for that passion.",1329091200,,1677,4.240625
2259282,5,B0008FXSZ6,"This dvd is great! It's not too long, and not too short. Best part is it has music that the adults will like (hopefully). I personally loved the Letter U song with Melissa Etheridge. Nora Jones and Sheryl Crowe are also in this. Good stuff!!",1327622400,,241,4.377777777777778
2259283,5,B0008FXSZ6,"This is a great DVD with very great singers. I'm particularly drawn to the letters B, U & Y - I'm only sure about Norah Jones doing Y. :) This is good to add to your collection if you have small children. Elmo also makes an appearance.",1291939200,,235,4.0212765957446805
2259284,5,B0008FXSZ6,"I know that parents brag all the time about how smart their kids are, so please excuse me for a moment while I brag on mine. :)  My son, who is now almost 3 years old, was given this DVD when he was about 16 months old.  He LOVED it and wanted to watch it all the time.  Here's the bragging part.  We were out in the car one day, about 2 months after he had started watching the video, and he said ""O"".  Sure enough, there was an ""O"" on a sign that he was pointing at.  This continued over the next 2 months until he was pointing out every letter of the alphabet on signs, in books, on labels at the grocery store, etc.  Now, I am an elementary school teacher, so everyone thinks he knows his alphabet because I have drilled it into his little head, but I promise I have not.  He is just really smart, and I believe that my child knew his alphabet at 20 months, in large part, because of this video.  The songs are even catchy enough for me to often be caught singing them around the house.  We love learning, and we LOVE Sesame Street!",1290038400,,1036,4.034313725490196
2259285,4,B0008FXSZ6,My son had this dvd but we lost it somewhere in our home. I ordered this dvd cheaper on amazon than the first dvd I bought from babiesrus. My son already loved this dvd. The one issue I had was the delivery time. It took about a week before I got the dvd. I ordered 2 seperate dvd's on the same day yet the other came faster.,1271376000,,325,3.8656716417910446
2259286,5,B0008FXSZ6,I ordered the DVD after a visit to see family and my baby really liked it. She now watches it at least two times a day and just can't get enough of it. She still can't talk but can sing along with the tunes to all the songs and the alphabet song. It's a huge hit in our house.,1270684800,,276,3.694915254237288
2259287,5,B0008FXSZ6,"I have a 17 month old who has never been interested in TV/videos, and this is the first one he requests (pointing to the TV) and will sit for it's entirety. I'm not a fan of putting kids in front of the tube, but you can feel confident that the content is at least academically focused, fast paced, and entertaining!",1263772800,,316,4.283333333333333
2259288,5,B0008FXSZ6,"The kids can't get enough of this one.  They watch it a few times a week.  I like it because it helps them learn all the letters.  Also some famous musicians make appearances like Dixie Chicks, Melissa Etheridge, Sheryl Crow, and other make it bearable for adults.",1256342400,,264,4.574468085106383
2259295,5,B0008FXSZ6,Our little 20 month old grandson loves this.  We get a kick out of it too.  It is definitely his favorite.,1247529600,,106,4.0
2259296,5,B0008FXSZ6,A great way for my daughter to learn the ABCs and I enjoyed watching it with her.  I think the hosts are really fun.,1243641600,,116,3.8333333333333335
2259297,5,B0008FXSZ6,"At first, we thought we had been fooled into buying something that didn't have Elmo in it at all.  But after several viewings, we realized that it's a perfect way to introduce songs/sketches for each letter.  Elmo is in several of the sketches, and the whole thing keeps our baby's attention.  Our baby is 22 months, and she can't yet sing the alphabet song because she just doesn't have the language to string through all of the letters.  But she is able to identify 13 letters when they are shown to her, and I think this video has a lot to do with it!  I know Kindergarteners who don't know 13 letters.  We're very impressed with the video and enjoy watching it as parents too.",1241222400,,680,4.4
2259298,5,B0008FXSZ6,"My 19 month old has been watching this DVD since he was 16 months old and he's always loved it. He doesn't find the beginning boring at all; he loves the people dressed as letters and shouts out ""A"" and ""Z"" everytime he sees them. Between this DVD, Here Come The ABC's from They Might Be Giants and Leapfrog's Letter Factory he has learned the entire alphabet and the phonics for each letter!",1231372800,,392,4.383561643835616
2259299,5,B0008FXSZ6,"I rate this DVD a five because it has served it's purpose for my child.  She will be two years old (on September 29, 2007) and she has known her alphabet since she was 20 months, thanks to ALL STAR ALPHABET.  Yes, the music is corny at first, but after hearing the songs everyday I found myself singing right along with her.  If you show intrest in the DVD, then so will your child.  Everyone is amazed at how my daughter can identify EVERY letter of the alphabet on our refrigerator or when we write it on paper.  I would recommend this item to anyone who wants a smart baby like mine ;-)",1190851200,2,589,4.176991150442478
2259300,5,B0008FXSZ6,We love this DVD (my wife and I) - and we are buying it again because we lost it moving to Europe.  Our son really loves it - and the songs are really good.  This is not an annoying Barney tape.  We can all listen to this one w/o going crazy.  5 stars all the way.,1190419200,,264,3.6607142857142856
2259301,2,B0008FXSZ6,"i bought this for my two year old baby, but she gets bored with it maybe because she is not familiar with the songs and people here like norah jones or any other artists so she doesn't like this and its hard for her to watch movie like this with lots of adult artists singing their popular songs and yet those songs obviously are not popular for the kids...",1184025600,,357,4.188405797101449
2259302,5,B0008FXSZ6,My son can't get enough. He watches this over and over. We sing the songs and have a good time with the letters. I am glad I brought this dvd it's the best thing since Brainy baby...,1179792000,,182,3.945945945945946
2259303,5,B0008FXSZ6,"I was also surprised by the poor reviews - both my two year old and one year old are riveted, which is fortunate as it's one of the only children's videos that doesn't make me want to gouge out my own eardrums. I will say that for actually learning the alphabet I think the Leapfrog Letter Factory is better, but there again you have the super annoying Professor Quigely - who I must say is no Stephen Colbert.",1176508800,,410,4.269230769230769
2259304,5,B0008FXSZ6,"My kids love this, and as an adult who has to sit through it, the banter and dry humor between A and Z is hilarious.  They dropped and scratched it when it fell out of the car on a family trip and I'm buying it again for my youngest who misses it so much.  The kids didn't seem to mind the less overwhelming presence of Elmo and really appreciate the great music. It's a nice break from Elmo and I was surprised that they picked up on the great underlying lesson about not boasting (A), and not not always being the most popular (Z).",1170806400,,533,4.115384615384615
2259305,4,B0008FXSZ6,"My kids are only 6 months old and this video holds their attention more than Baby Einstein and other dvds.  I'm surprised at the poor reviews, but all kids are different and don't like the same things...",1166486400,,203,4.486486486486487
2259306,4,B0008FXSZ6,"I give this video 4 stars.  I think it needs a little more Elmo and company to get 5 stars.  My daughter is not so stingent on rating her vids.  I think she would still give it 5 stars.  It keeps her attention, in spite of the fact that there are not enough muppets utilized in this video.  I definitely prefer (and so does she) the video called Seaseme ""Do the Alphabet.""  This video is good for variety though.",1162512000,,412,4.151898734177215
2259307,1,B0008FXSZ6,"Too much talking, boring actors, not something that holds children's interest. I should have never bought this.",1150243200,,111,5.588235294117647
2259308,5,B0008FXSZ6,"My 22 month old son absolutely LOVES this video.  He has watched several Baby Einstein and My Baby Can Talk videos, but once we got this one, he only wants to watch it.  He was very interested in the alphabet, so I bought this for him and he jumps and dances with the songs and shouts out the letters.  He is even singing the alphabet song when he isn't watching the video.  I highly recommend it.",1149033600,3,397,4.184210526315789
2259309,5,B0008FXSZ6,"My 2 year old loves this video, and watches it straight through.  She already knew her alphabet, but this video is helping her make more word connections.  She sings all of the songs, and talks about the letters and words at other times, so I see that she's learning from it.  And like all Sesame Street products, I enjoy it too.  One of our favourites!",1146528000,2,353,4.384615384615385
2259310,5,B0008FXSZ6,"I bought this on impulse because I saw Stephen Colbert on the cover and I think he is funny.  We have so many Sesame Street dvds and I knew the kids would love this, which they did.  All three of my children enjoy this dvd, even my 10 year old, who loves to see Sheryl Crow.

I must say, I grow weary of people who complain that Elmo is not in every skit of every dvd on the shelf.  While Elmo is a wonderful addition to the cast of characters, Sesame Street was thriving long  before the red monster arrived and the older, classic characters taught a whole generation of children, the very ones who are parents now.  Elmo is fine, but give the other characters a chance to grow on your children too.

This is a fun dvd, just as I expected it would be...fun for ALL AGES!",1146441600,3,771,4.134228187919463
2259311,3,B0008FXSZ6,"One of the things I love about the Sesame Street DVDs are the songs and the liveliness of the characters.  This video starts off REALLY boring with the A and Z walking around the mall talking to people about the letters.  My son wants to see characters and singing.  The parts with the Sesame Street gang and the songs are fun, but the rest is boring.  He lost attentinon with this video and normally he is enraptured by Sesame Street videos.  I might have to try another alphabet DVD.",1145404800,3,485,4.404494382022472
2259312,5,B0008FXSZ6,"I was surprised to read so many reviews saying that this video is not for toddlers.  My 21 month old is addicted to this video.  The first time we put it in, she watched it all the way through and wanted us to start it over again.  Unfortunately for her, it was bath time.

This is a DVD that I don't mind watching with my daughter.  So far it hasn't gotten on my nerves like so many other children's videos do.  The celebrity appearances are really sweet.  My daughter's favorite is the Dixie Chicks singing about the letter ""B"", but I think Larry King's interview with the letter W is pretty special too.

As a first alphabet video, this is fairly sophisticated, but the music and fun make it something we can all enjoy.  It might also help if your toddler/preschooler is already familiar with the alphabet before watching this, as it is more of a ""fun with letters"" than a ""learning your letters"" type of DVD.",1141776000,6,912,4.413173652694611

She's learned the words to the Dixie Chicks' letter B song and Sheryl Crow's letter I song, and sings along with the video. She also now likes listening to the original songs from the Dixie Chicks (I Can Love You Better), Sheryl Crow (Soak Up the Sun), Melissa Etheridge (Like the Way You Do), and Norah Jones (Don't Know Why).  My 17-mo old could care less about this video.",1141603200,,505,4.43010752688172
2259314,1,B0008FXSZ6,"I bought this sight-unseen at the store because I teach English to kids in Mexico and I figured it had to be better than the earlier Do the Alphabet release.  To my complete disappointment, this is EVEN WORSE than than the prior release.  The songs are a total bore (save the Sheryl Crowe number which is quite nice) and all seem to follow a very similar country/folksy rock format.  Usually they do a better job of mixing it up.  The two people who play letters A and Z and narrate this whole mess have all the flavor of carboard crust pizza with ketchup for sauce.  Do yourself a favor and avoid this video at all costs; I feel sick for having wasted money on it.  There isn't even any scene worth cutting to and showing my students.  The ""special features"" are totally worthless animated cuts...  they have way better vintage stuff they could have used.  The earlier reviewer from Mass. must certainly work for PBS; I had never seen them so desparate to resort to those types of tactics before.  I gave Do the Alphabet three stars and sadly this really can't even merit two.  You can't say you haven't been warned now so buy at your own risk!",1138665600,4,1145,4.430622009569378

The scenes are witty, and it's a good, entertaining teaching tool. The celebrities and cast seem to really be having fun doing it. Some (maybe all?) of the start segments are from other Sesame Street episodes, but they are good. I enjoyed it for the first 20 plays!",1469664000,,409,4.189873417721519
