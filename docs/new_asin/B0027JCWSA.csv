3867807,5,B0027JCWSA,This documentary addresses an alarming health issue in the USA. Every week (yes WEEK) 28 teens die by suicide in this country yet we try to ignore mental illness due to the stigma attached to it. Imagine if 28 teens died a week from the H1N1 virus!? It would be all we would hear on the news.,1267660800,19,292,4.140350877192983
3867808,1,B0027JCWSA,"I thought this was The Tracy Thurman Story, A Cry For Help.",1432166400,4,59,4.0
3867809,4,B0027JCWSA,Very informative and helpful.  Does not just apply to teenage suicide so it could be helpful for all ages.  Reaching out to people was the theme through out the whole documentary.,1425600000,,179,4.741935483870968
3867810,1,B0027JCWSA,"I was very disappointed, you showed this as a Nancy McKeon movie and when I got it, it was a documentary, not the movie.  My friend said she had the same thing happen to her.  She looked for Nancy McKeon movies and Cry for Help is the 4th movie listed.  But it is not the movie either of us wanted.",1425427200,15,298,3.933333333333333
3867811,1,B0027JCWSA,this is not a good deal.  they place it under a cry for help the tracy thurman story and send you this,1416182400,6,102,3.6363636363636362
3867812,5,B0027JCWSA,"I am an adolescent therapist.  I've used this video with multiple groups during therapy, and have only heard positive reviews.  Even this far out from these events, which were ages ago to most of the kids I work with, the things said still resonate as true.  There are plenty of facts in here, as well as personal experiences kids can relate to.  I wouldn't recommend it for much under the age of 13, but it is very effective to start a discussion about suicide and school violence with teenagers.",1383004800,3,497,4.550561797752809
3867813,1,B0027JCWSA,"During the video the director reads an essay from one of the children, but even though the essay is on the screen she fails to read words that indicate the essay is about a real or imagined military battle scene, not a  proposed school shooting. I am a mental health counselor at a school and was looking for something to possibly show students or parents on this important subject. However, the director makes a glaring mistake with this embarrassing example of ""agenda,"" even for the ""right"" reasons. Not one to lie to children, and even one to demand critical thinking skills from them, what do I say if one of them catches this BS and questions it? I would have to say that it is indeed BS and apologize profusely for my attempt at cognitive subterfuge. Then tell him or her to never, ever trust an adult, even on vital matters of life and death. This video is worthless to me because of the director's overreach.",1382313600,2,917,4.524096385542169
3867814,5,B0027JCWSA,"My 16 year old son, T.J. died by suicide on December 1, 2010. T.J. was an out-going, intelligent, funny, athletic boy who was struck with depression when he reached adolescence.  We didn't understand what was going on. We didn't see sad, we saw mad. I have since learned that 1 in 8 teens will suffer at least one depressive episode by the time they reach adulthood.

This video helps parents to understand what depression in teens looks and acts like. It is critical to understand the signs and symptoms because as in my case it can be a matter of life or death. Suicide is the 3rd leading cause of death in teens.

This video is a must see for all parents of teens.",1375142400,2,667,4.362903225806452
