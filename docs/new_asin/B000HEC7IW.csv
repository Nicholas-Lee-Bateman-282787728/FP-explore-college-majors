The songs that were used for examples were not really any of the songs tht we use at our church and there were not very many songs at that.  Guess that's why they are being sold by the Salvation Army Surplus Store. :(",1380499200,,355,3.971830985915493
8139031,5,B000HEC7IW,"Excellent DVD and helpful booklet! The material assumes you are not a complete beginner on the drums used (djembe, dumbek, bodhran). All of those instruments have their own detailed instructional materials (including DVDs) available through Amazon and elsewhere. So once you become reasonably proficient on the instrument's techniques,  Anderson's materials will specifically guide you into making musical choices as you incorporate them into a church service. Anderson has played on many recordigs of Christian artists on GIA Music, and demonstrates his percussion arrangements on some of those songs on this DVD. (GIA Music also carries this DVD.) This Marc Anderson is indeed ""the"" Marc Anderson who has played incredibly great percussion on the Steve Tibbetts recordings - regarded by professional percussionists as highly inspired. This is not a guy who picked up a djembe last year, he is a top-tier percussionist who studied in Africa, Brazil and elsewhere. You can trust his musical instincts.

from website:

Drums in the Church is a hands-on guide to the effective and creative use of percussion instruments in the context of Christian worship services. This essential DVD covers fundamental rhythms and techniques for a wide range of musical styles.

Marc Anderson, accomplished performer and instructor of percussion, has traveled the world teaching and worshiping in hundreds of churches, temples, and synagogues. This wealth of life experience provides the foundation for Drums in the Church.

Using the songs of the church, Anderson teaches Latin and African styles on hand drums, American folk style on the dumbek, and Irish or Northern European styles on the bodhran. Experienced percussionists, choir directors, and music ministers can all benefit from the easy-to-follow, step-by-step instructions on the DVD, which are reinforced by the accompanying 24-page booklet.

The Drums in the Church DVD features a picture-in-picture window for a front-row view of the different drumming techniques, which are demonstrated from several angles. Finally, church musicians everywhere have a helpful tool to encourage the joy and spiritual energy realized through the proper and tasteful use of percussion instruments in worship.",1172707200,,2237,5.603550295857988
