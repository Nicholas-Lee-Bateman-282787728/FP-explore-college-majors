4907220,4,B005Z9MHE8,"I had been waiting for this to be released and saw it on demand on Fios so I rented it and I'm very glad I did. I don't know which genre it actually fits in but I would put it under thriller/Mystery seeing as there is a mystery involved and it does thrill.
Sam Worthington and Jessica Chastain are great as ex spouses who are both detectives  working on murder cases but work in different jurisdictions,Worthington's partner played by Jeffery Dean Morgan is much more sympathetic to Chastain's character 'CSI Det,Pam Stall' and starts to help her work the killing fields while still trying his best to help Worthington in there jurisdiction. Chastain gives a tough as nails performance that is both believable and fun to watch.
Everyone is amazing in this film including Chlo Grace Moretz who plays the  daughter of a poverty stricken mother who likes to party and pleasure the local men  so her daughter has to roam the streets most of the time. There are some disturbing scenes and images but nothing over the top or gory.
I don't want to give anything away but it's very riveting and memorable.",1328140800,7,1097,4.644329896907217
4907221,2,B005Z9MHE8,"Got this BluRay to review for my site before it was released on DVD. While the quality was fine the movie was a mess.

First of all either bad editing, or bad writing made this movie super confusing. Characters popped up out of nowhere and they were spoken about like you were supposed to know what was going on with them. Same with the victims.

The descriptions of the movie made it seem like a cat and mouse game between cops and a serial killer and it really just wasn't ""cat and mouse"". I was thinking it would be something along the lines of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Seven/dp/B00464AVXW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Seven</a>&nbsp;but not even close.

Had this been a cut and dry cat and mouse chase with cops vs. serial killer it would have been a decent movie. But all the bouncing around and not making much sense made this brutal to watch even with the decent acting and budget. Quite frankly, I wouldn't bother with this one.

I don't know what the other reviewers here are thinking but if you check out reviews on IMDB, almost ALL of them mention how confusing it is due to editing/writing.",1327536000,9,1150,4.94300518134715
4907222,5,B005Z9MHE8,"I am not certain what the other reviewers saw. I was deeply engrossed in the film. The actual events are plain and simple. There are alot of missing young ladies along the highway systems in Texas. Many have been discovered as murdered. Some have been solved, others are in the cold case files.
The film plays out a few scenarios that might explain the disappearances. I would suggest that you rent the movie first. I did and I am buying it.",1327363200,,441,4.45679012345679
4907223,4,B005Z9MHE8,"Loosely inspired by actual events, TEXAS KILLING FIELDS starts off rather slowly, but evolves into an engrossing crime drama with some excellent, shocking action sequences.  Its major problem is that it presents viewers with more questions than it ultimately answers.

Apparently, over many decades, there has been a series of unsolved murders on a large piece of swampland, located between Houston, Texas and the Gulf Coast.  The killings remain unsolved, in part, because police departments in different jurisdictions, for whatever reasons, did not share information.  [I gleaned this data from the Internet, because it is not made clear in the movie.]

In this fictional screenplay, written by Donald F. Ferrarone and directed by Ami Canaan Mann (director Michael Mann's daughter), small town Texas cops Sam Worthington, Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Jessica Chastain are after a serial killer who is murdering young women and dumping their bodies in the swampland.  Unlike with the real life homicides, they do solve their case, but there are a couple of intriguing, quite surprising ""red herrings"" along the way.

The performances in TEXAS KILLING FIELDS are first-rate, even if some of the character's motivations are not apparent in the script. What the film really lacks is some backstory, particularly for the detective played by Morgan, as well as a scene in which everything is put into context.

The DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment contains audio commentary by Mann and Ferrarone.

4907224,1,B005Z9MHE8,"I thought the whole premise of this movie to be mis-leading. As a cop movie, it was OK. As a more factual movie, (based on fact) I thought it was bad. I live about 2 miles from the ""killing fields"" and know a bit about the history of these crimes. The movie was far from being factual.",1325030400,4,285,4.017543859649122
4907225,3,B005Z9MHE8,"""What you have now is a missing person, if you find a body call me right away."" Detectives Heigh (Morgan) and Souder (Worthington) are investigating a series of murders. A number of women are showing up in the marsh known as the Killing Fields which is outside their jurisdiction. The killer begins to lead the detectives on the wrong track with false clues. When a young local girl goes missing time is running out. This is a movie that started off strong and gradually slowed down until the ending. To me the biggest problem with movies like this are that although they are good and worth watching they play out like a TV show episode like a CSI or NYPD Blue or Southland. Those shows work because they are 45 minutes long. When you take a 45 min show and stretch it out an hour forty-five it loses the tenseness that it needs. Although it doesn't sound like it this is a good movie but should have been a TV show. Overall, fans of recent movies like ""Small Town Murder Songs"" or ""River Murders"" will really like this. Others like me will think it's just OK. I give it a B-.",1324598400,3,1076,4.358208955223881

4907227,4,B005Z9MHE8,"The film opens with the over used phrase, ""Inspired by true events."" Sam Worthington and Jeffrey Dean Morgan play two detectives in Texas City, Texas. They are investigating a murder of a young female while having to take care of domestic cases as a subplot. Jessica Chastain (The Help) plays CSI Det. Pam Stall. She is the ex-wife of Sam Worthington and investigating a disappearance in the ""Killing Field."" She requests the assistance of our two Texas City detectives who initially refuse because it is out of their jurisdiction. She is a ""Dirty Harriet"" type. Jeffrey Dean Morgan is from New York and plays the ""good cop"" as opposed to Worthington's ""bad cop"" role. Later we see their roles reverse. There has been 50 unsolved murders involving the Killing Field. Once a girl goes missing there, they are never found alive.

Chlo Grace Moretz plays a young troubled teen, taken in by Jeffrey Dean Morgan. When the killer decides to play a cat and mouse game with the cops, Chlo Grace Moretz becomes a missing pawn. The acting was excellent, even Worthington who I don't normally like. I enjoyed the steel guitar soundtrack. The plot lacked a good twist and needed a little more depth. If you enjoy a police crime drama, check it out. As a mystery... there are not enough characters for that.

Even before the character was created for ""The Walking Dead"" comic series, Negan proves to be very difficult to keep down!

Jokes aside, I really enjoyed this movie. Acting performances were well executed, even if a few minor plot points went a little off the deep end. I agree that a misdirect is sometimes used to provide a smokescreen for the viewers in determining guilt, but it felt a little flat, with no real development aside from a few key scenes with regard to said misdirect. It was diluted a little with filler plot points that didn't really add much in terms of cohesion with the main plot, but were brief enough to not oversaturate the entire movie with non-essential story arcs that have weak resolutions.",1491696000,,763,4.816793893129771

4907302,3,B005Z9MHE8,"I just recently got this movie because the true crime lover in me was watching Investigation Discovery and one of their shows did an episode around these cases and mentioned it had a movie made around it. Well, I want to say while the acting is really amazing and I love all the actors in here and have watched many of their others movies and shows they've played in. This movie isn't as much about the cases as it is about the detectives lives. I had hoped it would focus a bit more on the cases and the like but it's too character heavy for me to be centered around the Texas Killing Fields murders.

If you are looking for someone closer to the crimes this isn't for you. If you are looking for a mystery and thriller this would be a great movie. It's not heavy on any blood or gore so it's nothing crazy either. For those that don't like blood in movies and over the top killing. It's maybe 5% murders and the rest is all about the characters and chasing someone they believe to be the murder. Sometimes I was confused where the direction of the movie was going but it ended up where in the beginning I had predicted.

Had this movie been more around the killings I would have enjoyed it because I like the closer it is to the actual events and more about the crimes it's more interesting. Knowing about the detective and his partners ex-wife isn't something I needed to know. That's just me.",1455580800,5,1396,4.304182509505703

4907359,3,B005Z9MHE8,"Texas Killing Fields is a crime film that focuses on several killings along Houston's I-45 corridor between Houston and Galveston, in and around an area known as ""the killing fields""; the crime investigators on the case; their sacrifices and personal mission to protect the innocent; plus their stakeout to find the killer of the fictional character or victim in the movie. It was loosely inspired by true events surrounding the murders of women kidnapped from cities spread along 30 plus miles of I-45 corridor and dumped in many areas to include numerous bayous surrounding the oil fields of Texas City.

A local homicide detective and his partner, a transplanted cop from New York City as they track a sadistic serial killer dumping his female victims' mutilated bodies in a nearby marsh dubbed The Killing Fields. The killer changes the game and begins hunting the detectives, teasing them with possible clues at the crime scenes while always remaining one step ahead. When a local girl goes missing the detectives find themselves in a race against time to find their killer before she is murdered.

The film is a decent crime thriller, brewing up characters and plots used in better films. But the story simply doesn't stand up, with its combination of well-worn plot elements and confusing details that don't add up. Scenes do not always necessarily follow one another. Also,it was sometimes unclear who some of the characters were. The only notable element of this police procedural is that director Ami Canaan Mann, daughter of filmmaker Michael Mann,who produced here, appreciates dad's art in doing films but could only turn up an average crime thriller. Too bad that a competent cast was somewhat misused in it.",1416096000,,1722,5.03859649122807

4907363,2,B005Z9MHE8,"Texas Killing Fields is a movie that should have been a TV series instead. There is way too much going on here for a simple two hour movie, leaving things confusing and unsettled. Based on a true story, Texas Killing Fields tells the story of an area outside of Texas City known as the highway to hell. Since 1970, more than 60 bodies have been found dumped in this desolate area and most of the crimes have never been solved. This film follows the arrival of a New York City Homicide Detective, who has moved to the area and starts investigating a recent series of crimes. If this film had stuck to the story, it would have been terrific, because there was a lot to work with. Instead, the film jumps between three different crimes, in two different jurisdictions, which leaves a team of detectives separated and working on their own things. There is absolutely no background story on the detectives, the victims, the suspects, or the fields, and when the cops are talking to people, it feels like you've missed a whole lot of background information. Everyone knows everyone in these small towns, but the writers seem to have forgotten that we don't know anyone and were left extremely confused. There are a dozen suspect and a new victim every half hour. With each cop working on his own, we are thrown back and fourth to the point where the film becomes unwatchable. Avatar's Sam Worthington stars and as with that film, he's really nothing special. The guy is an interesting side character at best, but definitely not ready to be starring his own film. His partner is played by Jeffery Morgan, who eerily looks like he could be Javier Bardem's twin. Morgan was somewhat better than Worthington, but again the performance was uneven and hard to judge, because it was simply impossible to keep up with what was going on. Texas Killing Fields had a real life story to play on, but too many good ideas for it's own good. The producers try to pack in as much as they could into 105 minutes, which wasn't enough time to tell the story, and left the audience scratching it's heads.",1414281600,,2078,4.60377358490566

I needed a little bit of help with that, which is something that I wish had been more important to the makers of the film.  When I am working at keeping track of the threads and characters, it helps to have some moments be magnified, giving the viewer the opportunity to form a reaction to a number of moments or vignettes.  It seemed as if many important scenes were often filmed in the dark, making it harder for me to know who various characters are in a given scene.  More light would have really helped.",1405900800,,649,4.466101694915254

Even though it was based on true facts of the cases, it lacked any sort of cohesiveness and consistency in the story-telling.  Great performance by Sam Worthington and the rest of the cast, but very disjointed in the presentation.  The truth is that there were a number of killings by a number of people that placed the bodies in a number of places.  The story should have had more focus and not go off in different directions.

Worthington and Morgan are excellent as two small town detectives trying to run down a killer who preys on young women.  I have seen some reviews which said Jessica Chastain's part was more or less superfluous to the story, but to me she is such a fine actress that she only adds to anything she appears in.  There are also those who said the direction was weak or uneven.  I felt just the opposite.  But one of the strongest points going for this story, in my opinion, are the actors cast as villains in the piece.  They are so realistically frightening in their parts they almost made my skin crawl.  And, another huge plus in this film is you have another chance to see a wonderful young actress who is just starting to come into her own and that is Chloe Grace Moretz.

Forget the forgettable female cop: I don't see the point of even having her in the movie except to show off her looks. The victims' lives were not touched, there were loose ends with the two guys who were in the green car, there was not enough development in the religious cop and the bad Texas accent of the jerky cop obliterated everything he said.

The location shooting was done in a dusty back country area of Texas, and the area came across as a place you would not want to live  A  drive through town to get somewhere else, maybe.  The movie was low key, depressing, and gritty with very few high points.  But, as I said the acting was excellent and the story good.

Also conveying the reality that law enforcement officers live with everyday...seeing wrong on both sides of the law; their career choice hanging on them even at home in the dark hours; doing what they can with one hand tied.

The slow pace in the movie seems to be by design and lends to the overall atmosphere. The acting is excellent and the story is pretty well written. While not really promotes as such, I think the term ""psychological thriller"" fits this movie to a T.

The movie's interesting cast includes Jessica Chastain, Jason Clarke, Annabeth Gish, Sheryl Lee and Chlo Grace Moretz.

A major problem about the film is that the plot itself is not as interesting as the names of the cast. The subject matter (""inspired"" by the true events, the film says) is intriguing, but the storyline is disjointed. I thought at first the incoherent narrative is intentional on the part of director Ami Canaan Mann, and each piece eventually would fall into place as the bigger picture emerges. But that didn't happen.

I also thought that the film's story was more about the psychological aspect of those who were desperately tracking down the elusive criminal, like William Petersen's detective in ""Manhunter,"" directed by Michael Mann, father of Ami Canaan Mann. But I was mistaken as stock characters are unappealing, even the one played by Chlo Grace Moretz.

On this level, TEXAS KILLING FIELDS works quite well.

The biggest problem is that the whole storyline is a complete disaster. A number of characters who we're led to believe will play pivotal roles turn out to be completely unnecessary and just drop into nowhereland somewhere in mid-film. The scenes are jumbled, and there's no real sense of closure at the end. Decent acting, cinematography, and dialogue help a little, but not enough to redeem this mess.

4907410,5,B005Z9MHE8,"*-I decided to watch this movie as I am a big fan of Jessica Chastain, who emerged last year in three quite prominent movies: The Help, The Debt and Tree of Life.

Even though she gained an Academy Award nomination for The Help, in my opinion the movie that showcased her best was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Debt/dp/B003Y5H4Y8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Debt</a>, and though she did not get top billing, she was the lead actress.

Some of the movies in which she stars have taken a long time to go on release if at all. Wilde Salome, based on Oscar Wilde's play, her first movie directed by Al Pacino has yet to make an appearance.

Something about TKF lifts it above the ordinary, and makes it authentic. Perhaps, because it's based on a true story of a string of unsolved murders in Texas, where the bodies are occasionally found out in the oil fields, among large expanses and marshes where a body might never be found.

At the beginning the body of a young girl aged 15 is found, She looks like a girl played by Chloe Moretz, who has a bad home life. She is not the victim though, and we wonder as the movie progresses and the bodies accumulate if she will become a future victim. As we get to know the character it stirs our empathy. We sense the frustration of the detectives, who are taunted by the perpetrators.

The movie has the feel of a police procedural such as Law and Order SVU, yet has it's own distinct slow moving vibe. Sam Worthington and Jeffrey Dean Morgan, are the detective partners, and Jessica has a more supporting role as a detective in a neighbouring jurisdiction who used to be married to Sam Worthington's character.

The murders happen over a wide area and a long period of time and jurisdictional lines get blurred. The scenes are well put together and the movie is stylish, and several of the scenes are quite tense and gripping.

I think you will like it, and I hope this was helpful.

Another movie I recommend starring Jessica Chastain is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jolene/dp/B003Z8ZC2A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jolene</a>&nbsp;based on the story by EL Doctorow, but it's not for children.

4907418,3,B005Z9MHE8,"There is an area known as the ""killing fields"" in Texas, where 30 girls and young women have turned up dead since the 1970s. This stretch of land runs along I-45 between Houston and Galveston, Texas and is the bloodiest stretch of highway in America. Here are the basics on the murders that have haunted the area for decades. Just 50 miles long, over the past 38 years nearly 40 women and young girls have been murdered or vanished along this highway. Their bodies have been dumped in fields, parks and the many bodies of water in the area, usually in a sickening state. As of today, the killer is still on the loose. And detectives admit, they're no closer to catching him--although scientific advances could finally end the macabre dance of death. He first struck June 17, 1971. Colette Wilson, 13, had been dropped off from school band practice by the conductor at a bus stop. The young girl seemingly disappeared from the face of the earth. Five months later her nude body was discovered 40 miles away. She died of a single gunshot wound to the head and her flute was never located.

The story is grim and unfortunately so is the film version written by Don Ferrarone, a federal agent who investigated the slaughters, who has said  `If you can just imagine having one of these little girls out here...one of these young girls out here...and there's no chance for them to be rescued, to be helped. And they're on they're own.' It was the haunting faces of the lost that inspired Ferrarone to write the screenplay for the film.

The story for the film changes the names of everyone. Mike Souder (Sam Worthington), a homicide detective in a small Texan town, Texas City, and his partner, transplanted New York City cop Brian Heigh (Jefffrey Dean Stanton), track a sadistic serial killer dumping his victims' mutilated bodies in a nearby marsh locals called 'The Killing Fields'. Though the swampland crime scenes are outside their jurisdiction, Heigh is unable to turn his back on solving the gruesome murders. Despite his partner's warnings, he sets out to investigate the crimes. Before long, the killer changes the game and begins hunting the detectives, teasing them with possible clues at the crime scenes while always remaining one step ahead. When familiar local girl Anne (Chlo Grace Moretz) goes missing, the detectives find themselves racing against time to catch the killer and save the young girl's life.  That much of the plot is linear, but the sidebars of the local cop (Jessica Chastain, in a completely unnecessary tiny role) who happens to be the ex-wife of Souder, the stopover in a house of prostitution for young girls, the smarmy family of suspects, and other incidentals simply clot the plot and make the dark film (mood as well as lack of light) even more difficult to follow. Worthington and Morgan offer good performance with the poor script they are given, but in the end nothing is resolved and the director finds the need of adding a happy-wappy resolution which is completely out of place.

4907419,3,B005Z9MHE8,"Producer Michael Mann hires his daughter, Ami Canaan Mann to direct this well done crime film.  In what I think is Jeffrey Dean Morgan's best performance, the film revolves around 2 detectives working in Texas City, Texas an oil town near the Gulf coast.  Brian (Morgan) is a New York transplant working with a younger local (Sam Worthington) investigating a series of murders of young women.  The trail leads to a couple no-good creeps who are involved in child prostitution among other things.  Most of the murders are believed to have been committed in a remote swampy area called the Texas Killing Fields.

In that the case leads outside the city limits, a county investigator is also part of the team.  She is Pam (Jessica Chastain) who is also Mike's (Worthington) ex-wife.  Chloe Moretz is also along for the ride as the neglected teen daughter of another set of no-good crack-heads.  When she goes missing the drama intensifies leading to an unexpected but satisfactory conclusion.  Written by Don Ferrarone, the film is nothing special and certainly breaks no new ground, but is enjoyable if you like mysteries and police procedurals.  There are a few incoherent scene changes and I had a hard time understanding Worthington's mumbling attempt at a Texas accent, but otherwise worth a look.

The Blu ray is a 1080p transfer with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  It is very good, consistent with what Blu ray has to offer.  The Dolby TruHD 7.1 soundtrack is fine as well, but nothing special.  I had to crank it up a bit to understand some of the dialog.",1339200000,,1553,4.7894736842105265

4907421,2,B005Z9MHE8,"Transplanted policemen have been a staple in movies for years. Take JAWS for instance. So it's not often that these sorts of films offer us little in the way of surprises when the theme is chosen. Such is the case with TEXAS KILLING FIELDS.

Brian Heigh (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) is the relocated police detective in question. Having moved to Texas several years earlier he is teamed up with local hot shot Mike Souder (Sam Worthington). The pair are asked to be involved by the local sheriff (and Mike's ex-wife) when it seems a serial killer is on the lose.

The area in question is a matter of debate as far as jurisdiction is concerned. But killers never seem to worry about jurisdiction, they just find a place to dump a body and carry on. This seems to be the case as the bodies keep appearing and police keep investigating.
Even though it isn't in Heigh's area, he continues to look into the gruesome murders which weigh heavy on his mind.

Mike has a different attitude. He advises Brian to ignore the murders and concentrate on problems in their own back yard. But when the killer sees Brian taking notice he takes the murders to the police, leaving them clues and taunting them so that they'll stay on the case.

While all of this is going on a young girl in the area becomes a problem as well. Her mother dumps her outside while she ""entertains"" some of the local fellas. Brian and Mike both show some concern for the young girl and take her home giving her mother a warning. But if she did that where would the movie go?

The cat and mouse game back and forth between the killer, the police and the young girl is slow moving at best. The terrain is boring beyond belief to look at. And the mystery isn't all that complex that we can't figure out who's behind it all with little exertion.

All of the main actors involved in this film deserve better material and fortunately they have been getting it. This may not be the worst movie ever made but it's not one that most people would seek out and rightly so. There are far more interesting and entertaining films and mysteries that offer clues in with better methods. If the shelves at the local video store are bare, then perhaps this movie would be worth checking out. Otherwise let it slide.",1336953600,4,2251,4.464720194647202
4907422,5,B005Z9MHE8,"This is a truly brilliant film, it is based loosely on the case of women who were picked up in the I-45 and dumped in an oil field in League City Texas. It opens out at a crime scene where a girl's body has been found the two homicide detectives turn up to secure the crime scene. Brian Heigh played by Jeffery Dean Morgan (`Watchmen') he prays over her, his partner is less close to god and decidedly the bad cop of the pairing. He is Mike Souther (Sam Worthington), he is divorced from Detective Pam Stall (Jessica Chastain) who works in the adjoining jurisdiction and seems to rely quite heavily on their support. Only she has a corpse too, and then they find that strangled phone calls are being made from the bayou area; a place known as the Killing Fields.

As the suspects mount so does the body count. The personal riffs in all of the players lives often get in the way and there are so many ambiguous characters that you are kept guessing for a time. We also have child drug addicts, pimps and some trailer trash low life that all add to the mix. There are moments that are truly scary and not a single performance is in the foothills of bad. Jeffrey Dean Morgan does a magnificent job of the Catholic racked with guilt trying to do good in a very bad world and finally cracking in an absolutely convincing way.

The music sounded very Tindersticks and actually is in the form of erstwhile member Dickon Hinchliffe, and as expected is bloody marvellous and gets the atmosphere smack on. The framing of shots is superb and the pace is perfectly timed to keep the tension up without giving you the vapours. This was supposed to be directed by Slumdog tedium maker Danny Boyle, but he dropped out saying it was too dark to ever be made. Well his loss is our gain as Michael Mann who produced this got his daughter to do the project Ami Canaan Mann, and I think she has shown that genius can be in your genes.

This did not make a killing at the box office but has had wide distribution so I am hopeful that it will get the attention I feel it rightly deserves, this is a smouldering movie with just about all the right ingredients to become a classic, not a typical Hollywood film but it is all the better for it, if you are an indie film or even World cinema fan I think this would be right up your bayou - just brilliant.",1335657600,2,2329,4.300683371298406

The actors did a very good job with the necessary accents and body movements of the persons the film was based upon. The story was a composite of the various cases worked by the two detectives. The story was suspenseful, frightening and kept my attention throughout. I will watch it again and again to gain more of an understanding of the characters and their story. An excellent movie.",1330560000,3,628,4.566371681415929

4907432,4,B005Z9MHE8,Everything in the movie was well done and the story flowed nicely. My only beef is if Sam Worthington's character is supposed to be the Texas local why he had no Texas accent like every other 'Texan' portrayed in the film? Due this flaw it was difficult to discern which of the detectives transfered from New York. Other than that is a superior suspense based on true events (not sure how loosely though).,1329436800,,405,4.561643835616438
4907433,5,B005Z9MHE8,"When I bought Winter""s Bone I didn't have a clue how it would be and then found I bought a real gem. This one I feel the exact same way about. This movie should well have made theatrical viewing and right now it remains where I will view it for 4th time soon. Excellent cast, story. I am most pleased I purchased and I buy a lot that I watch one time and forget but not so with this. It well deserves far more recognition than it has received. A way of life most can't relate to but in parts of the Country exactly how it is and as Winter's Bone. It exists today. After writing I read a ""top reviewer"" slamming the movie. Oh was I irritated as cast, storyline was wonderful and no, you can't tell entire story in one movie since the killings have gone on so long BUT recently I was watching ID TV and the detectvies in it said the movie, yes, THIS movie, motivated them to go back and take another look at old cases, ending up 3 solved to grateful parents. THIS MOVIE did that, it is GREAT!",1329350400,2,990,4.082051282051282
4907434,3,B005Z9MHE8,"I selected this movie because I am from the area of Texas where it was filmed, and also I happen to like Jeffrey Dean Morgan.  The movie starts out rather slowly and stays that way through almost half.  The way it was edited left the audience a bit confused as to where we were and what was happening in the scene.  I gave it 3 stars mostly because of JDM, but I'm not sure I would recommend it to someone who isn't a fan of his or Sam Worthington.",1328572800,4,448,4.01123595505618

 Writing and directing are really inspired. This movie is NOT fact based, it is absorbing as a serial killer thriller however.",1328313600,35,365,4.703125
4907436,3,B005Z9MHE8,"I have to admit that I'm a sucker for atmospheric settings which is why I was drawn into liking Texas Killing Fields even when the movie itself wasn't living up to the premise. It is by no means a great movie but bolstered by a decent cast giving it their all I'm not one to write it off as a misfire.
The idea of the story is intriguing. In a small stretch of land through Houston to Galveston there have been a string of unsolved murders involving young women who's bodies are dumped in what has become known as The Killing Fields. This has been going on for the past thirty years adding up to about thirteen unsolved homicides. Thats an interesting story that unfortunately is muddled by a by the numbers script that takes every serial killer cliche it can and throws it in with a handfull of scenes based on true incidents.
The script as its presented is a bit of a mess in the long run involving two cops played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Sam Worthington investigating the murder of a teenage girl. Morgan is a honest cop, a family man from New York with a dark past and penchant for religion while Worthington is the young hothead with an ex-wife who keeps stealing Morgan from his jurisdiction to investigate another murder which may be related to their killing. Or maybe not as the movie seems to drop this plot point after a pivotal scene involving two killers in a car. Theres also young Chloe Grace Moretz put into mortal danger and the daughter of a town floozie who has a nurturing relationship with Morgans policeman and soon of course finds herself in the sights of the killer.
I can understand the idea of the split case issue but the way in which one construction of the plot is dropped is just jarring taken with a reveal of the killers thats left a little on the wanting side as far as motivations go. The film then unfortunately throws in little scenes involving a late night phone call from the killer or an early attack on a single mother which look good but don't really add anything to the question of why or how the killer is operating in the first place.
The story is truthfully better when it sticks with the procedural aspects of the story following the two cops around as they interview suspects, search for clues and simply follow the threads of the mystery to solve it. The moments of character buildup are decent and well acted by the cast. Its always great to Jeffrey Dean Morgan utilized in more humanistic role outside of some of the jerk characters He's portrayed in film. Sam Worthington criticized for his blandness does create this sort of quarterback detective thats interesting to watch. Moretz continues to shine as rising starlet with the thankless role as victim, and in his few scenes Stephen Graham is excellent as a creepy live in boyfriend to Moretz's mom. All of it held up in an atmosphere thats undeniably gritty but picturesqe, reminiscent of films like Fargo or Blood Simple in making the setting just as much of a character.
Director Ami Mann is if you haven't read it the daughter of Michael Mann and while her debut feature doesn't equal up to his work on similar films like Manhunter, it didn't feel to me like the drab subpar execution its been made out to be. With a little more focus on her next feature where story is concerned she could be a talent to watch.
In all Texas Killing Fields is a flawed film thats worth a rental at best
The Blu-Ray is a minimal affair at best. The image is good but nothing spectacular keeping the gritty view of the story's realistic ambitions with a good audio track to compliment it. The only extra is commentary with director Mann and the writer who give a good overview on the case but again is nothing I found totally mesmerizing. If you like the film there's nothing to really appreciate on the disc especially at a twenty dollar tag most retailers are offering the disc at.",1328227200,,3873,4.502840909090909
4907437,3,B005Z9MHE8,"""Inspired by true events,""  TEXAS KILLING FIELDS boasts a strong cast in a muddled, incoherent script.
A serial killer is on the loose, amassing a total of 50+ victims whose bodies are discovered in the titular fields.  Two detectives--one, a local whose ex-wife is a cop in a neighboring county, and the other is a transplant from NYC---join forces to find the killer.  The transplant cop also takes on aiding a young girl whose mama is a prostitute with thuggish boyfriends.
Amy Mann (daughter of acclaimed director Michael Mann) is heavy on atmosphere, but sparse in creating a cohesive film experience.  AVATAR's Sam Worthington is effective as the hotheaded local cop, but SUPERNATURAL's Jeffrey Dean Morgan is listless and phones in his performance.  Oscar nominee Jessica Chastain (THE HELP) steals all her scenes, once again proving what a versatile actress she is...she could be our next Meryl Streep!  Chloe Grace Moretz (LET ME IN) is virtually wasted in her role as Little Anne.  TWIN PEAKS' Sheryl Lee is quite chilling as Anne's drug-addled mother.
