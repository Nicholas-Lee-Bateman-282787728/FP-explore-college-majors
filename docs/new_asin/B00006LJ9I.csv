7971617,4,B00006LJ9I,The concert footage is good but the sound quality seems a little off. There are some great scenes w/ Slash. The backstage footage is great and so is the song selection.,1170892800,,168,4.451612903225806
7971618,4,B00006LJ9I,"Ron Wood, excellent guitar player, big heart, not much throat.  What you see is what you get.  This DVD may disappoint the general public, but it is good entertainment for Stones/ Faces/ Woody fans.  Youngsters in the band are quite good.  Andrea Corr adds a nice touch.  Slash can really play, duh.  If you like Ronnie's eclectic tastes in music, art and life, and enjoy loose jams with a lot of hammers, bends and slide guitar, this film is for you.",1156723200,,451,4.506172839506172
7971619,2,B00006LJ9I,"Ron Wood and Family for 1 hour, Live on DVD.

I have been a Ron Wood Fan since the Faces days. Still am.

For this DVD, 1 Star goes to Ron Wood and for the songs that are initially great; Another Star goes to the great Guitarist Slash who adds some perfect guitar sounds to this bad concert.

Nothing else worth mentioning other than the bad filming, sound and lighting, through out all the duration of this DVD.",1144800000,3,412,4.256410256410256
7971620,2,B00006LJ9I,"I've been a fan of Ron Wood from his days with Jeff Beck, to Rod Steward's solo recordings, to The Faces, to Woody's solo records, and to the Stones, but this is a disappointing DVD to me. Ron shouldn't be singing at all, as his voice is gone. Nor should he be playing harmonica.  The band doesn't have any passion and fire. And Slash's appearance was puzzling to me. He didn't add anything worthwhile at all to the concert.

I give it 2 stars because I like most of the songs. If you want to see Woody in his prime, hunt down the Faces ""Bad-n-Ruin"" DVD bootleg.",1141084800,2,562,4.242990654205608
7971621,5,B00006LJ9I,"Ron Wood takes the stage after a spirited introduction as ""The Sultan of Swag"" and launches into ""So you Want to be a Rock and Roll Star"". It becomes immediately apparent that Wood and the remarkable band that was assembled for this concert are in top form. Drummer Martin Wright is a great world class drummer and also really shines on vocals. Wright is one of the many unexpected and very pleasant surprises on this fine DVD.

 Ronnie Wood's family is well represented here by his brother-in- law Vinnie Karslake and daughter Lea Wood who are superb as back up vocalists. (The very capable and confident Karslake sings lead on one number) His son Jesse is on guitar and does a fine job. The rest of the band, all young and talented, are Tramper Price on keyboard, Frankie Gavin on violin and Mark Wells on Bass. Irish songstress Andrea Corr also appears on this show. (Wood lives in Ireland) And of course, last but not least Slash guests and plays on most of the DVD. I have never seen him looking uglier or playing better. ""Paradise City"" is a real rocker.

 The DVD is dedicated to Wood's friend the late George Harrison with whom Wood wrote the haunting ""Far East Man"" which is beautifully done here. ""Ooh La-La"" is also worth a special mention. All of the songs on this DVD are well done. It was filmed in a small venue called The Empire Theater and the joy felt by the audience is apparent.

 Extras on the DVD include a nicely done backstage documentary and a section that showcases some of Ron Wood's wonderful art. Look for hidden tracks here.

 A great DVD by one of Rock's great pros. A must have for any serious music fan.",1114905600,8,1636,4.484848484848484
7971622,5,B00006LJ9I,Ronnie shows why he has been a mainstay of the British and World rock community for the past four decades. A featured member of the Faces with Rod Stewart and for the past 28 years or so the Stones. His guitar playing doesn't have the finesse of a Clapton or the inventivness of Jimi Hendrix but it's right in the pocket and the rhythm is rock solid much like his bandmate Keith Richards. His vocals remind me of Bob Dylan a little rough hewn but very effective. Slash makes an appearance and adds a lot of fire to the event. Ronnie is your quinessential 60s 70s rock star. He still has the haircut from that period. He plays and sings like he's having a great time and letting the audiance in on the fun also.,1074902400,6,710,4.266666666666667
7971623,4,B00006LJ9I,"This is a great concert DVD.Woody,Andrea Corr,Slash, Woody's family. One of the best guitar shows I've seen. I just wish something this terrific could have lasted longer. Good Behind the Scenes features, and good audio and video.",1047168000,5,229,5.216216216216216
7971624,5,B00006LJ9I,I bought this DVD mainly because of SLASH but i really like the whole thing.  Wood and Co. really do rock the house.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone who likes SLASH of Ronnie Wood.  SLASH play on over half the DVD and really steals the show.  ...,1045008000,4,252,4.081632653061225
