7903000,4,B000003KAD,"Synopsis:
A space anomaly generates a parallel universed U.S.S. Voyager and crew, but only one ship can survive an assault by Vidiian invaders.
As the U.S.S. Voyager enters a plasma cloud to evade approaching Vidiian ships, Ensign Wildman goes into labor and delivers a baby girl. But as the crew emerges from the cloud, a series of astounding events occur: the warp engines stall, the antimatter supplies drain, and proton bursts cause a hull breach. What's more, Kim is sucked out into space, Kes vanishes in a mysterious void, and Wildman's baby dies.
As the hull breach widens, the ship is forced to run on emergency power. Another proton burst hits and Chakotay orders everyone off the bridge. To her surprise, Janeway sees herself walk across the bridge, which she assumes is a spatial fluctuation caused by their passage through the plasma cloud. Janeway visits Wildman in Sickbay and admires her newborn baby, who appears to be fine. The crew also beams aboard an unconscious patient who's identical to Kes.
This Kes ""double"" reports the same series of astounding occurrences, which leads Janeway to speculate that there's another U.S.S. Voyager nearby. Apparently, a divergence field has caused all sensor readings and every particle on the ship to duplicate. Unfortunately, there isn't enough antimatter to sustain both vessels. Janeway alerts the other U.S.S. Voyager crew, led by a duplicate Janeway. After a merger of the ships fails, Janeway decides to go over to the other ship through the void Kes disappeared into.
The two Janeways meet and strategize their options. The captain of the more heavily damaged U.S.S. Voyager proposes to self-destruct her ship and crew to save the other U.S.S. Voyager. With the Vidiians closing in, the two captains know they must act quickly or both ships and crews will be destroyed. Meanwhile, the Vidiians board one of the U.S.S. Voyagers.
Desperate to steal healthy organs to help battle a plague known as the Phage, the Vidiians begin attacking crewmembers. One of the Janeway captains decides to act. She sets her ship on self-destruct and orders the duplicate Kim to take Wildman's baby through the void. The Vidiians are destroyed when the duplicate U.S.S. Voyager explodes, while Kim, the baby and the other U.S.S. Voyager crew are saved.",1058054400,,2296,5.076719576719577
7903001,5,B000003KAD,"This is one of the better Voyager episodes I have seen, very intriguing and thought-provoking, with non-stop action.  The concept of space-time is explored, along with the possibilities of parallel universes.",1024272000,,208,5.709677419354839
7903002,5,B000003KAD,"This episode of Voyager is perhaps one of the most interesting and thought-provoking of Season Two.  In it, the viewer will see lots of action, an interesting and suprising storyline, and many of the neat ""twists"" that have made Berman and Co. into a legend.
The basic storyline involves the ship entering into a plasma cloud, then duplicating itself unbeknownst to the crew of either ship...at least initially!  However, because of the actions of one of the Voyagers, the other is severely damaged and a decision must ultimately be made which involves the sacrificing of one Voyager and crew in order to save the other.
Outstanding performances by Kate Mulgrew, Robert Picardo and Garrett Wang further enhance the viewer's enjoyment of this episode, and I give it 5 stars and call it a ""must see"" from Voyager Season Two.",996624000,3,822,4.906474820143885
