8047110,4,B0007G8FO0,Very good coming of age film that translates well into any language.  Mild nudity and some strong language but certainly PG-13 material as a whole.,1381363200,2,147,4.88
8047111,5,B0007G8FO0,"Loved it from the begining to the end , go and purchase it now.
One of Kusturica's Best Movies in my opinion.",1375401600,,109,4.0
8047112,5,B0007G8FO0,"I'm really surpised to read the luke warm reviews of this film.  It is an enchanting, intriguing story, extremely well written and the acting is some of the best I've ever seen.  (Although I think many of the actors were not ""professional"", at least at the time the film was made).  That coupled with its setting in per-war Sarajevo makes it a film not to be missed.  This film is not showy but it is deep, politically and emotionally.

The problem seems to be that EK's later films are so frenetic and fabulous that the reviewers just can't see the excellence of this seemingly simpler film.  The cinematography is mind blowing.  Watch it again, watch it slowly, see how the camera is used, how the scenes are constructed in space and over time.  EK clearly knows the history of film.  Beyond brilliant.  That coupled with the superb script makes this a movie to buy and keep close to the DVD player and your heart.

And finally, I think it is almost impossible to understand Underground, While Father Was Away and Black Cat/White Cat completely without seeing Dolly Bell.",1189814400,6,1073,4.654255319148936
8047113,3,B0007G8FO0,"You get a slice of life in Sarajevo (before war broke out in the early 90s and destroyed the place.)

Not a great film, not bad either. Entertaining and thoughtfully put together. Worth getting if you like this director's work.",1181606400,,227,4.675
8047114,3,B0007G8FO0,"Three stars is about right for this film.  Kusturica has become a phenomenal director, and while some of his more familiar tropes are present here--the anti-hero, extreme zaniness, gypsy music, etc.--this film doesn't compare to his later films, especially Time of the Gypsies and Underground.

That's not to say this is a bad movie; quite the contrary.  It's just that Kusturica's later films are so good that this one seems disappointing by comparison.

However, it's worth watching if for no other reason than the interview with Kusturica that's one of this dvd's extras.  Kusturica tells about his filmmaking style, his ethos, and how he was influenced by studying at the Prague Film School, as well as by Hollywood pictures from the 1940s to the 1970s.  It's very informative, and goes a long way toward helping one understand his later movies.",1148688000,10,849,5.0285714285714285
8047115,3,B0007G8FO0,"""Do You Remember Dolly Bell?"" is Kusturica's first feature film. His talent for telling a story and for seamlessly composing multi-layered scenes is apparent, as are his sincere depictions of humanity. The movie as a whole is quite enjoyable, but unlike some of Kusturica's later works, it is not a must see film.

The image quality of the DVD is very poor. To my eyes it looks like that this is mostly due to the condition of the original film material, not the quality of the DVD transfer.",1129680000,,491,4.579545454545454
