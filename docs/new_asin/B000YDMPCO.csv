Rather than rehash the excellent history of the Chan movies as given by other reviewers, I'd like to share a couple of personal experiences.

I was born in 1939, almost the same time as Sidney Toler's Chan character. Most of the movies I saw as a child were Toler movies, and I loved them all, and he remained my favorite Chan.

Being from small town America, I didn't see a Asian in person until after WWII.  The Japanese, of course, were always vilified in the movies of that time.  Charlie Chan showed my young mind that all Asians weren't villains and Chan and his sons and family became apart of my fantasy family.  I dreamed of growing up and portraying him in movies.

When I hear Asians talking about the harm the Chan movies did, I can only think about the love that they instilled in me.  As an adult, I have spent several years in Asian countries, enjoying the people and cultures of each country. I think that my love of the Chan movies made it very natural.

Further, this is great family entertainment, and when my youngest daughter arrived when I was in my late forties, we soon began sharing the Chan adventure via VHS and a LASER DISC collection.  Mantan Mooreland's ""Birmingham Brown"" made us laugh and we even worked up his famous routine that finished each other sentences!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Charlie-Chan-Chanthology-The-Secret-Service-The-Chinese-Cat-The-Jade-Mask-Meeting-at-Midnight-The-Scarlet-Clue-The-Shanghai-Cobra/dp/B00020X87A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Charlie Chan Chanthology (The Secret Service / The Chinese Cat / The Jade Mask / Meeting at Midnight / The Scarlet Clue / The Shanghai Cobra)</a>

It also upsets me when Mooreland's character is accused of being offensive for about the same reason as Chan's.  I was raised in the segregated South. Mantan and Steppin Fetchit not only made me laugh, but showed me the warmth and humor of blacks that I couldn't get in daily life.

So far, I have every Chan collection offered, and will continue buy all the collections.  I love the characters and the movies as good, clean, family entertainment.

3026531,5,B000YDMPCO,"I've been a Charlie Chan movie fan for many years.  I used to prefer the Oland movies; however, over the years I have come to appreciate how entertaining the Toler Chans are.  While Toler undoubtedly does less ""analytical detecting"" in these films than Oland in the earlier ones, the pace and plot of the later films have much to offer.  I own the six Toler Chans released prior to this date on DVD, and I have enjoyed watching them over and over again.  I intend to buy this collection--and any new future Toler Chan releases--to include in my Charlie Chan DVD library.  Die hard Oland Chan fans take note:  Give Toler a chance.  These movies are good, solid entertainment.",1203206400,6,674,4.61344537815126
3026532,5,B000YDMPCO,"Charlie Chan was originally created by novelist Earl Derr Biggers (1884-1933), who very loosely based the character on Hawaii's legendary police officer Chang Apana (1887-1933.) Biggers wrote six novels in all, and after several false starts 20th Century Fox (then simply known as Fox) hit on the right combination of actors, mystery, and comedy. The result was perhaps the single most popular film series Hollywood ever created.

Between 1931 and 1938 Chan was played by noted character actor Warner Oland.  When Oland died, 20th Century Fox scrambled to find a new actor for the role--and ultimately assigned the part to Sidney Toler, who was well-regarded on stage but little known through films.  In Toler's hands the character became less formal and the films began to emphasize comedy to a degree not previously seen.  Some fans rebelled at the change, and even today fans continue to argue the merits of Oland vs. Toler.  Even so, most fans would agree they enjoy both actors in the role.

The fourth installment in Chan film releases to DVD, this particular includes the first four films made by Toler: CHARLIE CHAN IN HONOLULU (1938), CHARLIE CHAN IN RENO, CHARLIE CHAN AT TREASURE ISLAND, and CHARLIE CHAN IN THE CITY OF DARKNESS (1939.)  Fans will find all of them enjoyable, and two of the four easily rank among the finest films in the series.

Producers felt it would be wise to ""ground"" the newly cast Toler by having his first film set in Hawaii.  Directed by H. Bruce Humberstone, who had done several of Warner Oland's most successful films, this entry finds Chan sent aboard a ship to unravel theft and murder among the likes of George Zucco and Phyllis Brooks--while coping with the unhelpful aid of newly cast Victor Sen Yung as son Jimmy.  Although enjoyable, this film has a faintly cautious feel, and certainly Humberstone adds little of his famous touch to the efforts.  With RENO, however, Toler hit his stride, and the result is a fascinating, witty, and clever murder mystery set in what was then the ""divorce capitol of the world,"" with actress Pauline Moore suspected of murdering romantic rival Louise Henry.  Actors Slim Summerville and Eddie Collins provide memorable comic relief!

TREASURE ISLAND is generally regarded as the best of Toler's Chan films, and with much good reason.  Although the plot has quite a few holes, it is quite fascinating in its tale of a phoney psychic who blackmails clients to suicide; unlike many Chan films it has impressive production values, particularly re lighting; and the cast is superlative, with Cesar Romero and Pauline Moore standouts.  In terms of plot, CITY OF DARKNESS is somewhat routine--but in terms of context it is astonishing, one of the first Hollywood films to take an open stance against Nazi Germany in this tale of espionage and murder on the eve of a possible German invasion of France.

As in previous DVD releases, the remastering of the films is quite good, if not entirely pristine, and the various DVDs come with numerous bonus features.  Unfortunately, however, these are not always as interesting as they have been in the past, with the audio commentary re TREASURE ISLAND tiresome at best and the audio reconstruction of CHARLIE CHAN'S COURAGE (a lost film) little better than what you might expect of Ed Wood.  Even so, there are numerous items of interest: a brief bio of Toler and of actress-writer Kay Linaker; items on Reno; and items on the real Treasure Island of San Francisco, among others.

Contemporary audiences tend to view the films as politically incorrect, but the fact remains that Chan and his family--most often personified by Keye Luke as son Lee and Victor Sen Yung as son Jimmy--were among the very few positive Asian characters on American movie screens at the time; as such they were particularly popular with Asian-American audiences of their day. Like all other films, Chan movies must be seen within the context of their times, and as such offer a frequently entertaining and often fascinating window in time.  Recommended.

Fox has once again delivered four perilous challenges---Charlie Chan in Honolulu, Charlie Chan in Reno, Charlie Chan at Treasure Island and Charlie Chan in the City Of Darkness---all restored, and all available for the first time on DVD.  What continues to make the Chan adventures so delightful is the tightly-wound, delightful combination of steely fortitude and lighthearted fortune-cookie wisdom. The blend of enlightened wit and jovial counsel in the face of treacherous situations still works in all its black-and-white glory.  The bonus features are top-notch, especially Sidney Toler: The Man Who Became Chan featurette.",1202774400,6,739,5.770642201834862

3026535,5,B000YDMPCO,"After Warner Oland's untimely death, Sidney Toler took over the reigns of playing the uncanny oriental sleuth. Keye Luke was very close to Oland and did not resume his role as #1 son. Victor Sen Yun (of Hopsing fame on Bonanza) took over Luke's role. The first Toler outing, IN HONOLULU is one of the best. The pre-war Chan movies (featured here) are some of the best work. WWII brought a more cautious series of Chan outings and they were not very entertaining. They were filled with patriotism (too much at times) and  followed a ""set"" formula (Chan working for the US government).

The flicks in this great box set filled with extra goodies, are terrific. Only one does not feature the energetic #1 son, THE CITY OF DARKNESS and is the weakest of the entries.

I won't go into plots, they have been adequately reviewed. The transition from Warner Oland to Sidney Toler, I found very easy assimilate thanks to great scripts. Toler is more acerbic in his role then Oland. But underneath his snippy barbs towards his children, he smiles in delight. In order to enjoy the Toler Chan, one must not compare the two different incarnations or it will spoil the continuation of this great series for you. Enjoy them for what they are, very well made B flicks filled with humor and mystery. A standout is TREASURE ISLAND and one of the best in the Toler series.

Thanks to Fox for releasing these hard to get Toler outings that were previously only available on poor bootleg copies. Keep up the good work. And enjoy these films and the many bonus features.

There was also a short-lived third Charlie Chan (Roland Winters in 6 movies). Toler made more Chan films than Oland and Luke and Sen Yun does return for the Winter's outings. They are not available at this time and Winters was not a very credible Charlie Chan but worth a watch if you can catch it on TV. For now we have more great Chan movies to enjoy.",1198800000,41,1904,4.539358600583091
3026536,5,B000YDMPCO,"I'm honored to be included in two special features made for CHARLIE CHAN IN RENO --  ""RENO MEMORIES"" and ""WELCOME TO RENO! AMERICA'S DIVORCE RESORT"".

The producers were looking for someone who could give a firsthand account of life in Reno during the 1940s, the heyday of the Reno six week divorce. I was working then as a dude wrangler on the Flying M E, an exclusive divorce ranch outside of Reno that catered to wealthy divorce seekers.

As the movie opens, the Mary Whitman character, in a cab on her way to a swank Reno hotel, could have been any number of divorce seekers who came to the Flying M E. She looks the part, believe me. The dialogue for the Cab Driver is pretty authentic, too.

Both special features are illustrated with photographs from my book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Divorce-Seekers-A-Photo-Memoir-of-a-Nevada-Dude-Wrangler/dp/0970167814/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""The Divorce Seekers: A Photo Memoir of a Nevada Dude Wrangler""</a>.

3026537,5,B000YDMPCO,"Warner Oland, not the first actor to play the great detective Charlie Chan on the silver screen but the man responsible for creating his look, demeaner and countenance in some sixteen Chan films, died in August of 1938.  Mr. Oland's health had been slowly declining and he reportedly walked off the set of ""Charlie Chan At The Ringside"", (eventually completed as ""Mr. Moto's Gamble"" with Peter Lorre,) to eventually return to his native Sweden where he passed away in Stockholm.  Meanwhile executives at 20th Century Fox had no intention of letting this most successful film series, (Chan movies reportedly earned over one million dollars each for the studio,) slip away and the great Charlie Chan casting call was announced.  The man eventually selected to replace Warner Oland was the relatively obscure non oriental actor, Sidney Toler of Missouri.  Fortunately with the release of Mr Toler's first Chan film in 1938, ""Charlie Chan in Honolulu"", it quickly became obvious that the film series was in good hands for what patrons wanted most was to see their favorite detective Charlie Chan's further adventures.  Which brings us to this wonderful fourth DVD release in the Fox collection of Charlie Chan films.  With the passing of Warner Oland, studio executives decided to take a fresh look at the Charlie Chan series.  Keye Luke, who had performed most admirably as Number One Son - Lee, would be replaced by Number Two Son - Jimmy, played with great panache and vigor by Sen Yung.  Mr. Oland's somewhat introverted Chan character became more extroverted in the capable hands of Sidney Toler.  With the 1939 production ""Charlie Chan in Reno,"" the series hit its stride with well acted, written and  directed productions.  Following Reno is perhaps the most interesting Chan film of all, (IMO,) ""Charlie Chan at Treasure Island.""  With a splendid cast to include Cesar Romero as The Great Rhadini and the exquisitely lovely Pauline Moore as his assistant Eve Cairo, this 1939 production uses the ""Golden Gate International Exposition On San Francisco Bay"" as the backdrop for one of the cleverest Chan mysteries of the entire series.  The fourth film in this box set serves in a way as a Charlie Chan wake-up call to a 1939 world on the brink of war, ""Charlie Chan In The City of Darkness.""  Having already visited Paris in 1935, this Chan adventure finds Mr. Toler in the company of the great character acter Harold Huber.  Paris is now a city in blackout and the race is on to prevent a weapons cache from falling into the hands of ?????  All the more reason to enjoy this fourth set in the continuing Charlie Chan series rom Fox.  Best regards, Hal Owen.",1196640000,183,2661,4.864745011086474

3026560,5,B000YDMPCO,"It's funny how your tastes in movies changes over time. Sixty years ago, my favorite in this collection would have been 'Treasure Island' because it's about a magician. And it still holds up with a good performance by Cesar Romero. Historically in this movie, we get glimpses of the World's Fair in Treasure Island which was built in the late 1930's and destroyed by the US Navy so that they could defend the harbor of San Francisco against the Japanese in WWII. Well worth watching. 'Honolulu' was Sidney Toler's first venture out as Charlie Chan after the untimely death of Warner Oland, so Toler's take as Chan had not solidified into the excellent performance he would give later on. You see the large Chan family, but some of this movie is just plain silly.  'City in Darkness' is another historical gem, written by European refugees who had fled Hitler and then wrote a warning of what was to come. It's an odd tale that does not seem to fit in the rest of the Chans, but it describes Paris before the German invasion in WWII by writers who had been there. So it is worth seeing. However, now that I am (much) older, the movie I like best in this collection is 'Charlie Chan in Reno' which was Toler's second outing. Like the others, the mystery is well written, with lots of suspects. But it has the added advantage of Slim Summerville ( who learned his comedic timing from Max Sennett) and Eddie Collins (without lion - see 'Honolulu') in a part well suited to his talents. Ricardo Cortez gives a good performance - he's a familiar face to those of us who love 'B' mysteries and we've seen him in  leading roles in the early thirties. Iris Wong who had played one of the 13 children in a very bit part In 'Honolulu' is now the maid and a love interest for Jimmy (Sen Yung), a part she would also play in 'Rio'. And Kay Linaker is another plus in this movie (Kay was in other Chans - 'Rio' and 'Treasure Island' - but she is most famous for being the creator and writer of the movie 'The Blob'). With the humor provide by some good comedians (Sen Yung included), the historical glimpse of the early Reno in 1939, the 'divorce capital', the ghost town sequence (my cat is frightened by the coyotes howling in the distance), and a very good mystery,  'Reno' has become my favorite in this set. If you like the older 30's mysteries and have not seen these you have a treat in store for you and I envy you not knowing 'who-dun-it'.",1498003200,5,2434,4.428571428571429

Earl Derr Biggers was born in Warren Ohio in 1884. In high school he founded a monthly magazine and went to Harvard. After graduating he became a newspaper reporter, then turned to writing novels. While on vacation in Honolulu he learned about the exploits of Chang Apana, a Chines detective on the Honolulu police force. Biggers wrote six Charlie Chan novels that were successful. His death from a stroke in 1933 ended his career. Over forty popular movies featured Charlie Chan. Werner Olands Chan movies were popular in China and in areas with ethnic Chinese populations. Movies that portrayed Chinese in a negative manner were banned in China, such as the Fu Manchu movies.

Warner Oland was the first actor to play Charlie Chan. Sidney Toler replaced him after Olands death. Tolers movies had more humor. This volume contains four movies plus background information. The Charlie Chan movies used to be shown on local television stations decades ago but today TV prefers films in color. You should enjoy these as examples of mystery movies with a recurring detective. See the individual reviews for more details. For background information read the books Charlie Chan at the Movies by Ken Hanke and Charlie Chan by Yunte Huang.

Disc 1: Charlie Chan in Honolulu - Chan investigates a murder on a boat; there are complications but Chan figures it out.
Disc 2: Charlie Chan in Reno - Chan is called to help a lady facing a murder charge, he deduces the name of the murderer.
Disc 3: Charlie Chan at Treasure Island - Chan travels to San Francisco and learns about a mystic; is he a blackmailer?

Sets, filming, scripts, acting.... have a much more professional appearance.

Later films with other sons and daughters as sidekicks give the films a more 'high school production"" tone to the film. All films with Roland Winters have a decline in quality.

Character Birmingham Brown of the later films is an insult to African Americans. A cheap stereotypical shot at developing ""loyal"" employee to Chan household.

The first disk, ""Charlie Chan in Honolulu,"" has an extra on it that explains why the studio picked Toler to take over as Charlie Chan.  The movie itself was not one of the better Charlie Chans, but it wasn't the worst, either.  The next one, ""Charlie Chan in Reno,"" was a much better effort, and you could tell that Toler was gaining his stride as Charlie.  It was reasonably well-done.  The third offering, ""Charlie Chan at Treasure Island,"" was interesting in that it had a overtone of the occult, and was nicely handled, too.  The fourth film, ""City in Darkness,"" had a grim foretelling of the impending war, namely WWII.  Charlie Chan's closing line was prophetic, as it was supposed to have been.  All told, this is a pretty good collection and shows Sydney Toler successfully coming up to speed as Charlie Chan.

With Warner Oland's sudden and unexpected death in 1938, 20th Century Fox were presented with the same problem Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli would face three decades later when Sean Connery decided he'd had enough of playing 007 - how to continue a huge moneymaking franchise without the star responsible for much of its success. With the Chan films instrumental in keeping the studio in business, there was no question of dropping the series, and after a whirlwind search Sidney Toler got the job and Charlie Chan in Honolulu was rushed into production. His tenure would see the series move from A to B pictures at Fox and even lower once he took the initiative, bought the rights and shopped the series round to other studios before finally finding a taker with Poverty Row outfit Monogram, but while his start in the role was somewhat awkward he did manage to prove there was still box-office life in the character even without Oland, eventually making 22 Chan films, eleven of them at Fox.

Sidney Toler's take is slightly different, generally being more decisive than Oland (perhaps to compensate for occasionally finding himself on the sidelines of the plot) and increasingly sharper with his Number Two Son, played by Victor Sen-Yung after Fox neglected to renew Number One Son Keye Luke's contract. In his first outing he's still trying to capture some of the warmth that characterised Oland's films, something the film helps along by introducing him in the bosom of his family as he is about to become a grandfather. Naturally it's not long before he's dragged away from the maternity hospital to solve a murder on board a ship newly arrived in Honolulu, but not before Number Two and Number Five sons (Sen-Yung and Layne Tom Jr.) have spent a couple of reels blundering in his place. As if two junior Chans weren't enough, additional comic relief is provided by Eddie Collins and Oscar the Lion, Collins providing the kind of exaggerated cowardly jabbering schtick that some modern commentators would be fast to label racist had it been given to a black actor.

Among the suspects are George Zucco's very odd doctor (who naturally keeps a murderer's living brain in his trunk), Marc Lawrence's hood (with Richard Lane's cop in tow), Phyliss Brooks' courier and Claire Dodd's fellow passenger with a secret. It's not a particularly compelling mystery and there's one nonsensical moment where Charlie allows a suspect to pull a gun on him for absolutely no good reason, but while it does threaten to outstay its welcome it does offer a decent if slightly bumpy introduction for the new Chan on the block.

Fox's DVD offers a respectable transfer, a good brief featurette on Sidney Toler - who was quite the Renaissance Man in his now all-but-forgotten stage career - and an excellent one on the search for a new Chan and the reinvention of the series in the wake of Oland's death. Also included is another reconstruction of a lost Chan film using extensive stills and actors reading the script like a vintage radio show, Charlie Chan's Courage, and stills gallery.

""I want a lawyer!""
""That won't be hard. Half the population of Reno is lawyers.""

It was with his second outing, Charlie Chan in Reno, that the Toler films really hit their stride, in no small part due to Norman Foster, who had steered the Peter Lorre Mr. Moto films to success and took the series into slightly darker and certainly seedier territory to reflect pulp crime fiction's move away from the drawing room. It doesn't exactly have Charlie pounding the mean streets, but the choice of the biggest little city in the world, where everyone makes their living from other people's misery n the divorce capital of the USA, is a perfect setting for a slightly more lurid tale. Set largely in a hotel catering to men and women waiting the mandatory six weeks for their divorces to become final, Chan is called in by an old friend to prove his wife's innocence when she's found over the body of the woman he's divorcing her for. Naturally as the most obvious suspect she can't possibly be guilty, which is probably good news for the second most obvious suspect, Ricardo Cortez's lounge lizard hotel doctor, the kind of part that allows cinema's first Sam Spade ample opportunities to demonstrate his own brand of seedy charm opposite Phyllis Brooks' perky hostess, Kay Linaker's hotel manager and Pauline Moore's just-asking-for-it murder victim.

Although Number Two Son is along for the ride again, with Slim Summerville's lugubrious sheriff and Eddie Collins cabbie thrown in to the mix as well, the film surprisingly doesn't overdo the comedy and gets the balance just right. Indeed, it often goes out of its way to undercut Collins' shtick when it turns out that not only can Charlie Chan uncover the murderer but he can also get cabbies to shut up. The film looks great with some atmospheric night work, the writers and Foster turning in a terrifically pacey number that's among the best in the series.

Along with a couple of featurettes on Reno and the divorce laws of the day, trailer and stills gallery, Fox's DVD also includes an interview with Kay Linaker - but be warned, right from the start it includes spoilers not just for this film but the other Chan films she appeared in as well.

""If befriend donkey, expect to be kicked.""

Sending the honorable detective to the San Francisco World's Fair rather than on a voyage on the Hispaniola with Long John Silver, Charlie Chan at Treasure Island is a thoroughly enjoyable Sidney Toler entry once again ably directed by Norman Foster that sees Charlie on the trail of a psychic who blackmails his clients. Aided and abetted by Number Two Son, Douglas Fowley's reporter, Pauline Moore's `genuine' mind reader and Cesar Romero's dashing magician who is on a Houdini-like mission to expose fake psychics, the surprisingly short list of suspects includes Douglas Dumbrille's suspicious insurance actuary, Romero's knife-throwing wife June Gale and Billie Seward's shill for the elusive Dr Zodiac. You won't need a degree in criminology to guess the guilty party pretty early in proceedings, but the film zips along in highly enjoyable fashion with surprisingly little in the way of comic relief en route to its lengthy onstage conclusion, Charlie even making a few minor errors along the way and getting to show a lot more warmth and compassion in his earlier scenes than in later Toler efforts before taking a well earned bow.

Fox's DVD offers a nice transfer with audio commentary, stills gallery and featurettes on the World's Fair and the possible influence the film had on San Francisco's notorious Zodiac Killer in the 60s as extras.

""Everyone we questioned said they left at the stroke of midnight. I never saw so many Cinderellas!""

City in Darkness is in many ways the most daring of the Fox Chan films, defying the Production Code of the day to criticise Hitler's warmongering before the war had even started in Europe. Beginning with a montage recounting the growing belligerence of Gemany and Italy and set in a panic-stricken Paris going through a crime-friendly total blackout in the anticipation of war breaking out at any minute, it sees Chan visiting old friends in the European intelligence services to reminisce about one war while waiting for the next to start. And when murder finally strikes, it's not the usual crime of passion or profit but part of a Nazi scheme to smuggle munitions out of France to be used against the French with the help of Douglas Dumbrille's big-time profiteer.

It's at times a surprisingly unflattering portrait of France, especially compared to the more inspiring ones in wartime propaganda films: even before a crime is committed, profiteers like Leo G. Carroll are making a small fortune out of selling steamship tickets and false passports while hotel owners gleefully inform on their guest. There's little bravery on display and much fear as conversations and even part of the final confrontation with all the suspects are stopped dead in their tracks by the sound of planes overhead. The danger is fairly palpable throughout, with the customary failed attempt on Chan's life the threat of torture and disfigurement with nitric acid at the hands of Carroll and his faithful thug Lon Chaney Jr. And when the murderer is finally unmasked, they are met with the promise of a medal rather than punishment because ""In humble opinion, murder is harsh word for act committed in defence of country."" Even Chan's final epigram is a rather stark and chilling dismissal of the Munich Peace Accord that gives other characters the momentary illusion of a happy ending.

Not everything is so successful, with Harold Huber overdoing it this time as the comic relief in the kind of performance that's like a 1930s template for Tim Curry at his hammiest, though it's easy to see why the studio thought they needed some release from the pressure for the audience. Ably directed by Herbert I. Leeds, it's one of the best and most striking of the Chan films.

Fox's DVD includes an excellent featurette on the making of the film, covering its origins as a non-Chan play by writers Gina Kaus and Ladislas Fodor, themselves refugees from the Nazis who found themselves in Paris before moving to Hollywood and the way the studio used Charlie Chan to get it to the widest possible audience who would have avoided an obvious `message' movie. There's also a second featurette on screenwriters Robert Ellis and Helen Logan, stills gallery and original trailer.",1345507200,6,9681,4.890310786106033

Later Jimmy Chen points out that if one commits suicide because of blackmail that this is murder. Now Charlie Chan must ferret out a notorious mystic named zodiac protecting his friend's reputation and other potential suicides.

He is helped in this endeavor by his son Jimmy, a professional magician Fred Rhadini (Cesar Romero), newspaper reporter Peter Lewis (Douglas Fowley), among others.

This is an excellent movie for Charlie Chan (Sidney Toler) fans. The opening scene of the clipper was interesting as they didn't have one going that way at that time, and one of the things that you notice that the clipper had these large windows. We also get a great look at the International Expo at ""Treasure island."" Another added plus is seeing a young Cesar Romero.

3026795,5,B000YDMPCO,"This 1938 Charlie Chan film made just before World War II is a significant film because unlike all other Charlie Chan films, it was made as a propaganda movie to warn people about the impending war and the horrors of Nazi Germany, events that will change history. The film was originally written as a play by a Jewish woman who escaped just in time from Germany and a Hungarian man. It was sold to the movies and the officials decided to make it into a Charlie Chan story because the Charlie Chan films were very popular and more people would come to see it. The movie warned about German spies and it mocked the Munich Conference and Neville Chamberlain's assurances that he was acquiring assurances from Adolph Hitler that there would be peace. The film has typical Chan statements such as him saying, ""I was not prepared for an emergency, like a man who bought a new suit with only one pair of pants."" The story occurs in Paris and focuses on the murder of a man who had charged his associate with a crime. The charged man claims that the murdered man was involved in espionage. Although the message is important, the film has very many comic parts and is fun to watch.",1308009600,3,1172,4.481308411214953

Your ship anchors, the man boards, but as you are about to hand him the money, he is shot dead.  Charlie, and two of his sons, investigate.  This was Sidney Toler's first Chan movie.

""Charlie Chan in Reno"" - If you are Mary Whitman, you have left Honolulu for Reno to get an easy divorce from Kurt.  Once there, you are accosted by the sexy Jeanne Bently, who laughingly crows that she is going to marry Kurt!  Later that night, you are found beside her body.  When Kurt learns of your arrest, he gets Charlie to find the real murderer.

""Charlie Chan at Treasure Island"" - If you are Jimmy Chan, you can't wait to see the San Francisco World's Fair and you can't wait to get off this airplane; flying in a thunderstorm is dangerous!  Everyone seems so calm; even Pop's author friend, Paul Essex, jokes about death.  Later, when the fairgrounds are in sight, you discover Paul has typed his last page.

""Charlie Chan in City in Darkness"" - It's 28 September 1938.  Fear runs rampant in Paris; Hitler is threatening France over its support for Czechoslovakia.  That night, a man is murdered in his study.  The person, who finds the body, flees into the night.  By morning, the murder is solved and peace is apparently at-hand with the announcement that France's Daladier and Great Britain's Chamberlain are going to Munich to negotiate with Hitler.

3026823,3,B000YDMPCO,"Chinese Americans often object to the Charlie Chan movies, but i think the early ones can be defended. Warner Oland looked a bit Chinese & had spent much of his career playing Oriental characters. He hardly required any make-up at all. The crafty Chinese detective was the hero. Keye Luke, who played #1 son Lee was Chinese.

But, with the Fox-produced Sidney Toler Chan movies (which begin on DVD with this collection), the complaints really gain substance. Toler didn't look remotely Chinese & a lot of make-up was required. Jimmy Chan, #2 son (played by a young Chinese actor) is an annoying, bumbling fool whom Charlie Chan often treats with contempt. Fox studios never even considered casting a Chinese actor as Charlie Chan. Toler was a very fine actor, but his portrayal of Charlie Chan was based on the Warner Oland character, more than the original Charlie Chan character of the books. Toler's Chan doesn't have a gun and seems to often shrink from physical violence or even physical contact.

I MUCH prefer the Oland films!

However, on the ""up"" side: the production values in these films is better than the earlier ones, the writing is good, the acting is good. For some ""Charlie Chan at Treasure Island"" (included here) is considered a high point in the entire Chan series.",1211155200,,1285,4.831818181818182

Warner Oland is the original Chan, but Toler was an inspired replacement.  His Chan fit the more streamlined look and feel of the post-Oland Chan series.  WW II was looming and the films became more glossy, more formulaic, and more light hearted.  The films move at a lightening pace, and the comedy is stressed, unlike the more serious Oland films.

Fox and then 20th Century Fox made 28 Chan movies between 1926 and 1942. Four of the earliest ones were lost in vault fires in the 1950's.

These four films are the first Chan mysteries made with Sidney Toler playing Chan since Warner Oland died in 1939.  Simultaneously, Sen Yung (#2 son - Jimmy) replaces Keye Luke (#1 son - Lee) as Chan's sidekick.  Keye Luke did not want to continue the series after Warner Oland died.

These are not the best of the series, but are still very entertaining.  ""Charlie Chan in Honolulu"" is the transitional movie and is rated by Leonard Maltin as the best of this quartet. It is one of the few times in the series that Chan is in Honolulu and you get to see his massive family (11 children). My favorite is Treasure Island because of the fun plot with Cesar Romero playing a magician.

One of the benefits of the restorations is that 20th Fox loads each disc with featurettes that give background information about the movies locale or the actors.  Also, there is a reenactment of ""Charlie Chan's Courage"" (one of the 4 lost films) using the script, voice actors and production still photos.

As usual Chan solves each mystery, uses lots of old Chinese sayings, doesn't take itself too seriously, plus gives you a  peek at what life was like almost 70 years ago.

Rather than rehash the excellent history of the Chan movies as given by other reviewers, I'd like to share a couple of personal experiences.

I was born in 1939, almost the same time as Sidney Toler's Chan character. Most of the movies I saw as a child were Toler movies, and I loved them all, and he remained my favorite Chan.

Being from small town America, I didn't see a Asian in person until after WWII.  The Japanese, of course, were always vilified in the movies of that time.  Charlie Chan showed my young mind that all Asians weren't villains and Chan and his sons and family became apart of my fantasy family.  I dreamed of growing up and portraying him in movies.

When I hear Asians talking about the harm the Chan movies did, I can only think about the love that they instilled in me.  As an adult, I have spent several years in Asian countries, enjoying the people and cultures of each country. I think that my love of the Chan movies made it very natural.

Further, this is great family entertainment, and when my youngest daughter arrived when I was in my late forties, we soon began sharing the Chan adventure via VHS and a LASER DISC collection.  Mantan Mooreland's ""Birmingham Brown"" made us laugh and we even worked up his famous routine that finished each other sentences!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Charlie-Chan-Chanthology-The-Secret-Service-The-Chinese-Cat-The-Jade-Mask-Meeting-at-Midnight-The-Scarlet-Clue-The-Shanghai-Cobra/dp/B00020X87A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Charlie Chan Chanthology (The Secret Service / The Chinese Cat / The Jade Mask / Meeting at Midnight / The Scarlet Clue / The Shanghai Cobra)</a>

It also upsets me when Mooreland's character is accused of being offensive for about the same reason as Chan's.  I was raised in the segregated South. Mantan and Steppin Fetchit not only made me laugh, but showed me the warmth and humor of blacks that I couldn't get in daily life.

So far, I have every Chan collection offered, and will continue buy all the collections.  I love the characters and the movies as good, clean, family entertainment.

While Toler undoubtedly does less ""analytical detecting"" in these films than Oland in the earlier ones, the pace and plot of the later films have much to offer.  I own the six Toler Chans released prior to this date on DVD, and I have enjoyed watching them over and over again.  I intend to buy this collection--and any new future Toler Chan releases--to include in my Charlie Chan DVD library.  Die hard Oland Chan fans take note:  Give Toler a chance.  These movies are good, solid entertainment.",1203206400,6,674,4.61344537815126
3261029,5,B000YDMPCO,"Charlie Chan was originally created by novelist Earl Derr Biggers (1884-1933), who very loosely based the character on Hawaii's legendary police officer Chang Apana (1887-1933.) Biggers wrote six novels in all, and after several false starts 20th Century Fox (then simply known as Fox) hit on the right combination of actors, mystery, and comedy. The result was perhaps the single most popular film series Hollywood ever created.

Between 1931 and 1938 Chan was played by noted character actor Warner Oland.  When Oland died, 20th Century Fox scrambled to find a new actor for the role--and ultimately assigned the part to Sidney Toler, who was well-regarded on stage but little known through films.  In Toler's hands the character became less formal and the films began to emphasize comedy to a degree not previously seen.  Some fans rebelled at the change, and even today fans continue to argue the merits of Oland vs. Toler.  Even so, most fans would agree they enjoy both actors in the role.

The fourth installment in Chan film releases to DVD, this particular includes the first four films made by Toler: CHARLIE CHAN IN HONOLULU (1938), CHARLIE CHAN IN RENO, CHARLIE CHAN AT TREASURE ISLAND, and CHARLIE CHAN IN THE CITY OF DARKNESS (1939.)  Fans will find all of them enjoyable, and two of the four easily rank among the finest films in the series.

Producers felt it would be wise to ""ground"" the newly cast Toler by having his first film set in Hawaii.  Directed by H. Bruce Humberstone, who had done several of Warner Oland's most successful films, this entry finds Chan sent aboard a ship to unravel theft and murder among the likes of George Zucco and Phyllis Brooks--while coping with the unhelpful aid of newly cast Victor Sen Yung as son Jimmy.  Although enjoyable, this film has a faintly cautious feel, and certainly Humberstone adds little of his famous touch to the efforts.  With RENO, however, Toler hit his stride, and the result is a fascinating, witty, and clever murder mystery set in what was then the ""divorce capitol of the world,"" with actress Pauline Moore suspected of murdering romantic rival Louise Henry.  Actors Slim Summerville and Eddie Collins provide memorable comic relief!

TREASURE ISLAND is generally regarded as the best of Toler's Chan films, and with much good reason.  Although the plot has quite a few holes, it is quite fascinating in its tale of a phoney psychic who blackmails clients to suicide; unlike many Chan films it has impressive production values, particularly re lighting; and the cast is superlative, with Cesar Romero and Pauline Moore standouts.  In terms of plot, CITY OF DARKNESS is somewhat routine--but in terms of context it is astonishing, one of the first Hollywood films to take an open stance against Nazi Germany in this tale of espionage and murder on the eve of a possible German invasion of France.

As in previous DVD releases, the remastering of the films is quite good, if not entirely pristine, and the various DVDs come with numerous bonus features.  Unfortunately, however, these are not always as interesting as they have been in the past, with the audio commentary re TREASURE ISLAND tiresome at best and the audio reconstruction of CHARLIE CHAN'S COURAGE (a lost film) little better than what you might expect of Ed Wood.  Even so, there are numerous items of interest: a brief bio of Toler and of actress-writer Kay Linaker; items on Reno; and items on the real Treasure Island of San Francisco, among others.

Contemporary audiences tend to view the films as politically incorrect, but the fact remains that Chan and his family--most often personified by Keye Luke as son Lee and Victor Sen Yung as son Jimmy--were among the very few positive Asian characters on American movie screens at the time; as such they were particularly popular with Asian-American audiences of their day. Like all other films, Chan movies must be seen within the context of their times, and as such offer a frequently entertaining and often fascinating window in time.  Recommended.

Fox has once again delivered four perilous challenges---Charlie Chan in Honolulu, Charlie Chan in Reno, Charlie Chan at Treasure Island and Charlie Chan in the City Of Darkness---all restored, and all available for the first time on DVD.

3261032,5,B000YDMPCO,"After Warner Oland's untimely death, Sidney Toler took over the reigns of playing the uncanny oriental sleuth. Keye Luke was very close to Oland and did not resume his role as #1 son. Victor Sen Yun (of Hopsing fame on Bonanza) took over Luke's role. The first Toler outing, IN HONOLULU is one of the best. The pre-war Chan movies (featured here) are some of the best work. WWII brought a more cautious series of Chan outings and they were not very entertaining. They were filled with patriotism (too much at times) and  followed a ""set"" formula (Chan working for the US government).

The flicks in this great box set filled with extra goodies, are terrific. Only one does not feature the energetic #1 son, THE CITY OF DARKNESS and is the weakest of the entries.

I won't go into plots, they have been adequately reviewed. The transition from Warner Oland to Sidney Toler, I found very easy assimilate thanks to great scripts. Toler is more acerbic in his role then Oland. But underneath his snippy barbs towards his children, he smiles in delight. In order to enjoy the Toler Chan, one must not compare the two different incarnations or it will spoil the continuation of this great series for you. Enjoy them for what they are, very well made B flicks filled with humor and mystery. A standout is TREASURE ISLAND and one of the best in the Toler series.

Thanks to Fox for releasing these hard to get Toler outings that were previously only available on poor bootleg copies. Keep up the good work. And enjoy these films and the many bonus features.

There was also a short-lived third Charlie Chan (Roland Winters in 6 movies). Toler made more Chan films than Oland and Luke and Sen Yun does return for the Winter's outings. They are not available at this time and Winters was not a very credible Charlie Chan but worth a watch if you can catch it on TV. For now we have more great Chan movies to enjoy.",1198800000,41,1904,4.539358600583091
3261033,5,B000YDMPCO,"I'm honored to be included in two special features made for CHARLIE CHAN IN RENO --  ""RENO MEMORIES"" and ""WELCOME TO RENO! AMERICA'S DIVORCE RESORT"".

The producers were looking for someone who could give a firsthand account of life in Reno during the 1940s, the heyday of the Reno six week divorce. I was working then as a dude wrangler on the Flying M E, an exclusive divorce ranch outside of Reno that catered to wealthy divorce seekers.

As the movie opens, the Mary Whitman character, in a cab on her way to a swank Reno hotel, could have been any number of divorce seekers who came to the Flying M E. She looks the part, believe me. The dialogue for the Cab Driver is pretty authentic, too.

3261034,5,B000YDMPCO,"Warner Oland, not the first actor to play the great detective Charlie Chan on the silver screen but the man responsible for creating his look, demeaner and countenance in some sixteen Chan films, died in August of 1938.  Mr. Oland's health had been slowly declining and he reportedly walked off the set of ""Charlie Chan At The Ringside"", (eventually completed as ""Mr. Moto's Gamble"" with Peter Lorre,) to eventually return to his native Sweden where he passed away in Stockholm.  Meanwhile executives at 20th Century Fox had no intention of letting this most successful film series, (Chan movies reportedly earned over one million dollars each for the studio,) slip away and the great Charlie Chan casting call was announced.  The man eventually selected to replace Warner Oland was the relatively obscure non oriental actor, Sidney Toler of Missouri.  Fortunately with the release of Mr Toler's first Chan film in 1938, ""Charlie Chan in Honolulu"", it quickly became obvious that the film series was in good hands for what patrons wanted most was to see their favorite detective Charlie Chan's further adventures.  Which brings us to this wonderful fourth DVD release in the Fox collection of Charlie Chan films.  With the passing of Warner Oland, studio executives decided to take a fresh look at the Charlie Chan series.  Keye Luke, who had performed most admirably as Number One Son - Lee, would be replaced by Number Two Son - Jimmy, played with great panache and vigor by Sen Yung.  Mr. Oland's somewhat introverted Chan character became more extroverted in the capable hands of Sidney Toler.  With the 1939 production ""Charlie Chan in Reno,"" the series hit its stride with well acted, written and  directed productions.  Following Reno is perhaps the most interesting Chan film of all, (IMO,) ""Charlie Chan at Treasure Island.""  With a splendid cast to include Cesar Romero as The Great Rhadini and the exquisitely lovely Pauline Moore as his assistant Eve Cairo, this 1939 production uses the ""Golden Gate International Exposition On San Francisco Bay"" as the backdrop for one of the cleverest Chan mysteries of the entire series.  The fourth film in this box set serves in a way as a Charlie Chan wake-up call to a 1939 world on the brink of war, ""Charlie Chan In The City of Darkness.""  Having already visited Paris in 1935, this Chan adventure finds Mr. Toler in the company of the great character acter Harold Huber.  Paris is now a city in blackout and the race is on to prevent a weapons cache from falling into the hands of ?????  All the more reason to enjoy this fourth set in the continuing Charlie Chan series rom Fox.  Best regards, Hal Owen.",1196640000,183,2661,4.864745011086474

3261057,5,B000YDMPCO,"It's funny how your tastes in movies changes over time. Sixty years ago, my favorite in this collection would have been 'Treasure Island' because it's about a magician. And it still holds up with a good performance by Cesar Romero. Historically in this movie, we get glimpses of the World's Fair in Treasure Island which was built in the late 1930's and destroyed by the US Navy so that they could defend the harbor of San Francisco against the Japanese in WWII. Well worth watching. 'Honolulu' was Sidney Toler's first venture out as Charlie Chan after the untimely death of Warner Oland, so Toler's take as Chan had not solidified into the excellent performance he would give later on. You see the large Chan family, but some of this movie is just plain silly.  'City in Darkness' is another historical gem, written by European refugees who had fled Hitler and then wrote a warning of what was to come. It's an odd tale that does not seem to fit in the rest of the Chans, but it describes Paris before the German invasion in WWII by writers who had been there. So it is worth seeing. However, now that I am (much) older, the movie I like best in this collection is 'Charlie Chan in Reno' which was Toler's second outing. Like the others, the mystery is well written, with lots of suspects. But it has the added advantage of Slim Summerville ( who learned his comedic timing from Max Sennett) and Eddie Collins (without lion - see 'Honolulu') in a part well suited to his talents. Ricardo Cortez gives a good performance - he's a familiar face to those of us who love 'B' mysteries and we've seen him in  leading roles in the early thirties. Iris Wong who had played one of the 13 children in a very bit part In 'Honolulu' is now the maid and a love interest for Jimmy (Sen Yung), a part she would also play in 'Rio'. And Kay Linaker is another plus in this movie (Kay was in other Chans - 'Rio' and 'Treasure Island' - but she is most famous for being the creator and writer of the movie 'The Blob'). With the humor provide by some good comedians (Sen Yung included), the historical glimpse of the early Reno in 1939, the 'divorce capital', the ghost town sequence (my cat is frightened by the coyotes howling in the distance), and a very good mystery,  'Reno' has become my favorite in this set. If you like the older 30's mysteries and have not seen these you have a treat in store for you and I envy you not knowing 'who-dun-it'.",1498003200,5,2434,4.428571428571429

Earl Derr Biggers was born in Warren Ohio in 1884. In high school he founded a monthly magazine and went to Harvard. After graduating he became a newspaper reporter, then turned to writing novels. While on vacation in Honolulu he learned about the exploits of Chang Apana, a Chines detective on the Honolulu police force. Biggers wrote six Charlie Chan novels that were successful. His death from a stroke in 1933 ended his career. Over forty popular movies featured Charlie Chan. Werner Olands Chan movies were popular in China and in areas with ethnic Chinese populations. Movies that portrayed Chinese in a negative manner were banned in China, such as the Fu Manchu movies.

Warner Oland was the first actor to play Charlie Chan. Sidney Toler replaced him after Olands death. Tolers movies had more humor. This volume contains four movies plus background information. The Charlie Chan movies used to be shown on local television stations decades ago but today TV prefers films in color. You should enjoy these as examples of mystery movies with a recurring detective. See the individual reviews for more details. For background information read the books Charlie Chan at the Movies by Ken Hanke and Charlie Chan by Yunte Huang.

Disc 1: Charlie Chan in Honolulu - Chan investigates a murder on a boat; there are complications but Chan figures it out.
Disc 2: Charlie Chan in Reno - Chan is called to help a lady facing a murder charge, he deduces the name of the murderer.
Disc 3: Charlie Chan at Treasure Island - Chan travels to San Francisco and learns about a mystic; is he a blackmailer?

Sets, filming, scripts, acting.... have a much more professional appearance.

Later films with other sons and daughters as sidekicks give the films a more 'high school production"" tone to the film. All films with Roland Winters have a decline in quality.

Character Birmingham Brown of the later films is an insult to African Americans. A cheap stereotypical shot at developing ""loyal"" employee to Chan household.

The first disk, ""Charlie Chan in Honolulu,"" has an extra on it that explains why the studio picked Toler to take over as Charlie Chan.  The movie itself was not one of the better Charlie Chans, but it wasn't the worst, either.  The next one, ""Charlie Chan in Reno,"" was a much better effort, and you could tell that Toler was gaining his stride as Charlie.  It was reasonably well-done.  The third offering, ""Charlie Chan at Treasure Island,"" was interesting in that it had a overtone of the occult, and was nicely handled, too.  The fourth film, ""City in Darkness,"" had a grim foretelling of the impending war, namely WWII.  Charlie Chan's closing line was prophetic, as it was supposed to have been.  All told, this is a pretty good collection and shows Sydney Toler successfully coming up to speed as Charlie Chan.

With Warner Oland's sudden and unexpected death in 1938, 20th Century Fox were presented with the same problem Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli would face three decades later when Sean Connery decided he'd had enough of playing 007 - how to continue a huge moneymaking franchise without the star responsible for much of its success. With the Chan films instrumental in keeping the studio in business, there was no question of dropping the series, and after a whirlwind search Sidney Toler got the job and Charlie Chan in Honolulu was rushed into production. His tenure would see the series move from A to B pictures at Fox and even lower once he took the initiative, bought the rights and shopped the series round to other studios before finally finding a taker with Poverty Row outfit Monogram, but while his start in the role was somewhat awkward he did manage to prove there was still box-office life in the character even without Oland, eventually making 22 Chan films, eleven of them at Fox.

Sidney Toler's take is slightly different, generally being more decisive than Oland (perhaps to compensate for occasionally finding himself on the sidelines of the plot) and increasingly sharper with his Number Two Son, played by Victor Sen-Yung after Fox neglected to renew Number One Son Keye Luke's contract. In his first outing he's still trying to capture some of the warmth that characterised Oland's films, something the film helps along by introducing him in the bosom of his family as he is about to become a grandfather. Naturally it's not long before he's dragged away from the maternity hospital to solve a murder on board a ship newly arrived in Honolulu, but not before Number Two and Number Five sons (Sen-Yung and Layne Tom Jr.) have spent a couple of reels blundering in his place. As if two junior Chans weren't enough, additional comic relief is provided by Eddie Collins and Oscar the Lion, Collins providing the kind of exaggerated cowardly jabbering schtick that some modern commentators would be fast to label racist had it been given to a black actor.

Among the suspects are George Zucco's very odd doctor (who naturally keeps a murderer's living brain in his trunk), Marc Lawrence's hood (with Richard Lane's cop in tow), Phyliss Brooks' courier and Claire Dodd's fellow passenger with a secret. It's not a particularly compelling mystery and there's one nonsensical moment where Charlie allows a suspect to pull a gun on him for absolutely no good reason, but while it does threaten to outstay its welcome it does offer a decent if slightly bumpy introduction for the new Chan on the block.

Fox's DVD offers a respectable transfer, a good brief featurette on Sidney Toler - who was quite the Renaissance Man in his now all-but-forgotten stage career - and an excellent one on the search for a new Chan and the reinvention of the series in the wake of Oland's death. Also included is another reconstruction of a lost Chan film using extensive stills and actors reading the script like a vintage radio show, Charlie Chan's Courage, and stills gallery.

""I want a lawyer!""
""That won't be hard. Half the population of Reno is lawyers.""

It was with his second outing, Charlie Chan in Reno, that the Toler films really hit their stride, in no small part due to Norman Foster, who had steered the Peter Lorre Mr. Moto films to success and took the series into slightly darker and certainly seedier territory to reflect pulp crime fiction's move away from the drawing room. It doesn't exactly have Charlie pounding the mean streets, but the choice of the biggest little city in the world, where everyone makes their living from other people's misery n the divorce capital of the USA, is a perfect setting for a slightly more lurid tale. Set largely in a hotel catering to men and women waiting the mandatory six weeks for their divorces to become final, Chan is called in by an old friend to prove his wife's innocence when she's found over the body of the woman he's divorcing her for. Naturally as the most obvious suspect she can't possibly be guilty, which is probably good news for the second most obvious suspect, Ricardo Cortez's lounge lizard hotel doctor, the kind of part that allows cinema's first Sam Spade ample opportunities to demonstrate his own brand of seedy charm opposite Phyllis Brooks' perky hostess, Kay Linaker's hotel manager and Pauline Moore's just-asking-for-it murder victim.

Although Number Two Son is along for the ride again, with Slim Summerville's lugubrious sheriff and Eddie Collins cabbie thrown in to the mix as well, the film surprisingly doesn't overdo the comedy and gets the balance just right. Indeed, it often goes out of its way to undercut Collins' shtick when it turns out that not only can Charlie Chan uncover the murderer but he can also get cabbies to shut up. The film looks great with some atmospheric night work, the writers and Foster turning in a terrifically pacey number that's among the best in the series.

Along with a couple of featurettes on Reno and the divorce laws of the day, trailer and stills gallery, Fox's DVD also includes an interview with Kay Linaker - but be warned, right from the start it includes spoilers not just for this film but the other Chan films she appeared in as well.

""If befriend donkey, expect to be kicked.""

Sending the honorable detective to the San Francisco World's Fair rather than on a voyage on the Hispaniola with Long John Silver, Charlie Chan at Treasure Island is a thoroughly enjoyable Sidney Toler entry once again ably directed by Norman Foster that sees Charlie on the trail of a psychic who blackmails his clients. Aided and abetted by Number Two Son, Douglas Fowley's reporter, Pauline Moore's `genuine' mind reader and Cesar Romero's dashing magician who is on a Houdini-like mission to expose fake psychics, the surprisingly short list of suspects includes Douglas Dumbrille's suspicious insurance actuary, Romero's knife-throwing wife June Gale and Billie Seward's shill for the elusive Dr Zodiac. You won't need a degree in criminology to guess the guilty party pretty early in proceedings, but the film zips along in highly enjoyable fashion with surprisingly little in the way of comic relief en route to its lengthy onstage conclusion, Charlie even making a few minor errors along the way and getting to show a lot more warmth and compassion in his earlier scenes than in later Toler efforts before taking a well earned bow.

Fox's DVD offers a nice transfer with audio commentary, stills gallery and featurettes on the World's Fair and the possible influence the film had on San Francisco's notorious Zodiac Killer in the 60s as extras.

""Everyone we questioned said they left at the stroke of midnight. I never saw so many Cinderellas!""

City in Darkness is in many ways the most daring of the Fox Chan films, defying the Production Code of the day to criticise Hitler's warmongering before the war had even started in Europe. Beginning with a montage recounting the growing belligerence of Gemany and Italy and set in a panic-stricken Paris going through a crime-friendly total blackout in the anticipation of war breaking out at any minute, it sees Chan visiting old friends in the European intelligence services to reminisce about one war while waiting for the next to start. And when murder finally strikes, it's not the usual crime of passion or profit but part of a Nazi scheme to smuggle munitions out of France to be used against the French with the help of Douglas Dumbrille's big-time profiteer.

It's at times a surprisingly unflattering portrait of France, especially compared to the more inspiring ones in wartime propaganda films: even before a crime is committed, profiteers like Leo G. Carroll are making a small fortune out of selling steamship tickets and false passports while hotel owners gleefully inform on their guest. There's little bravery on display and much fear as conversations and even part of the final confrontation with all the suspects are stopped dead in their tracks by the sound of planes overhead. The danger is fairly palpable throughout, with the customary failed attempt on Chan's life the threat of torture and disfigurement with nitric acid at the hands of Carroll and his faithful thug Lon Chaney Jr. And when the murderer is finally unmasked, they are met with the promise of a medal rather than punishment because ""In humble opinion, murder is harsh word for act committed in defence of country."" Even Chan's final epigram is a rather stark and chilling dismissal of the Munich Peace Accord that gives other characters the momentary illusion of a happy ending.

Not everything is so successful, with Harold Huber overdoing it this time as the comic relief in the kind of performance that's like a 1930s template for Tim Curry at his hammiest, though it's easy to see why the studio thought they needed some release from the pressure for the audience. Ably directed by Herbert I. Leeds, it's one of the best and most striking of the Chan films.

Fox's DVD includes an excellent featurette on the making of the film, covering its origins as a non-Chan play by writers Gina Kaus and Ladislas Fodor, themselves refugees from the Nazis who found themselves in Paris before moving to Hollywood and the way the studio used Charlie Chan to get it to the widest possible audience who would have avoided an obvious `message' movie. There's also a second featurette on screenwriters Robert Ellis and Helen Logan, stills gallery and original trailer.",1345507200,6,9681,4.890310786106033

He is helped in this endeavor by his son Jimmy, a professional magician Fred Rhadini (Cesar Romero), newspaper reporter Peter Lewis (Douglas Fowley), among others.

This is an excellent movie for Charlie Chan (Sidney Toler) fans. The opening scene of the clipper was interesting as they didn't have one going that way at that time, and one of the things that you notice that the clipper had these large windows. We also get a great look at the International Expo at ""Treasure island."" Another added plus is seeing a young Cesar Romero. Actually the whole bevy of actors from that time made this a double plus good movie.",1316736000,,987,4.975757575757576
3261292,5,B000YDMPCO,"This 1938 Charlie Chan film made just before World War II is a significant film because unlike all other Charlie Chan films, it was made as a propaganda movie to warn people about the impending war and the horrors of Nazi Germany, events that will change history. The film was originally written as a play by a Jewish woman who escaped just in time from Germany and a Hungarian man. It was sold to the movies and the officials decided to make it into a Charlie Chan story because the Charlie Chan films were very popular and more people would come to see it. The movie warned about German spies and it mocked the Munich Conference and Neville Chamberlain's assurances that he was acquiring assurances from Adolph Hitler that there would be peace. The film has typical Chan statements such as him saying, ""I was not prepared for an emergency, like a man who bought a new suit with only one pair of pants."" The story occurs in Paris and focuses on the murder of a man who had charged his associate with a crime. The charged man claims that the murdered man was involved in espionage. Although the message is important, the film has very many comic parts and is fun to watch.",1308009600,3,1172,4.481308411214953

Your ship anchors, the man boards, but as you are about to hand him the money, he is shot dead.  Charlie, and two of his sons, investigate.  This was Sidney Toler's first Chan movie.

""Charlie Chan in Reno"" - If you are Mary Whitman, you have left Honolulu for Reno to get an easy divorce from Kurt.  Once there, you are accosted by the sexy Jeanne Bently, who laughingly crows that she is going to marry Kurt!  Later that night, you are found beside her body.  When Kurt learns of your arrest, he gets Charlie to find the real murderer.

""Charlie Chan at Treasure Island"" - If you are Jimmy Chan, you can't wait to see the San Francisco World's Fair and you can't wait to get off this airplane; flying in a thunderstorm is dangerous!  Everyone seems so calm; even Pop's author friend, Paul Essex, jokes about death.  Later, when the fairgrounds are in sight, you discover Paul has typed his last page.

""Charlie Chan in City in Darkness"" - It's 28 September 1938.  Fear runs rampant in Paris; Hitler is threatening France over its support for Czechoslovakia.  That night, a man is murdered in his study.  The person, who finds the body, flees into the night.  By morning, the murder is solved and peace is apparently at-hand with the announcement that France's Daladier and Great Britain's Chamberlain are going to Munich to negotiate with Hitler.  Chan has a great last line ...

3261320,3,B000YDMPCO,"Chinese Americans often object to the Charlie Chan movies, but i think the early ones can be defended. Warner Oland looked a bit Chinese & had spent much of his career playing Oriental characters. He hardly required any make-up at all. The crafty Chinese detective was the hero. Keye Luke, who played #1 son Lee was Chinese.

But, with the Fox-produced Sidney Toler Chan movies (which begin on DVD with this collection), the complaints really gain substance. Toler didn't look remotely Chinese & a lot of make-up was required. Jimmy Chan, #2 son (played by a young Chinese actor) is an annoying, bumbling fool whom Charlie Chan often treats with contempt. Fox studios never even considered casting a Chinese actor as Charlie Chan. Toler was a very fine actor, but his portrayal of Charlie Chan was based on the Warner Oland character, more than the original Charlie Chan character of the books. Toler's Chan doesn't have a gun and seems to often shrink from physical violence or even physical contact.

I MUCH prefer the Oland films!

However, on the ""up"" side: the production values in these films is better than the earlier ones, the writing is good, the acting is good. For some ""Charlie Chan at Treasure Island"" (included here) is considered a high point in the entire Chan series.",1211155200,,1285,4.831818181818182

Warner Oland is the original Chan, but Toler was an inspired replacement.  His Chan fit the more streamlined look and feel of the post-Oland Chan series.  WW II was looming and the films became more glossy, more formulaic, and more light hearted.  The films move at a lightening pace, and the comedy is stressed, unlike the more serious Oland films.

Fox and then 20th Century Fox made 28 Chan movies between 1926 and 1942. Four of the earliest ones were lost in vault fires in the 1950's.

These four films are the first Chan mysteries made with Sidney Toler playing Chan since Warner Oland died in 1939.  Simultaneously, Sen Yung (#2 son - Jimmy) replaces Keye Luke (#1 son - Lee) as Chan's sidekick.  Keye Luke did not want to continue the series after Warner Oland died.

These are not the best of the series, but are still very entertaining.  ""Charlie Chan in Honolulu"" is the transitional movie and is rated by Leonard Maltin as the best of this quartet. It is one of the few times in the series that Chan is in Honolulu and you get to see his massive family (11 children). My favorite is Treasure Island because of the fun plot with Cesar Romero playing a magician.

One of the benefits of the restorations is that 20th Fox loads each disc with featurettes that give background information about the movies locale or the actors.  Also, there is a reenactment of ""Charlie Chan's Courage"" (one of the 4 lost films) using the script, voice actors and production still photos.

As usual Chan solves each mystery, uses lots of old Chinese sayings, doesn't take itself too seriously, plus gives you a  peek at what life was like almost 70 years ago.
