8306152,4,B001GMH8X8,"Dora embarks on a super sized fairytale, adventure,along with her Monkey Pal Boots, and Swiping Fox Swiper. They must return the items Swiper took in the story book village. Most importantly,the group needs to get to the Three Little Pigs, who need their bricks back, to protect them from the Wolf.
Dora and friends use the map,as they move through the different fairytales. As they pass, and complete tasks they move closer to their detestation. A little bit of Spanish,and other educational elements are used to complete their mission.",1240617600,,537,5.044943820224719
