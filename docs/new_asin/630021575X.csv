251891,5,630021575X,"Olivia de Havilland's performance in LADY IN A CAGE, like the film, was one of the truly Oscar-worthy performances of the 1960's which has remained underacknowledged, much less underappreciated. As is often the case with groundbreaking, visionary works, LADY IN A CAGE was difficult for audiences of 1963 to accept as something worth their time and money. Too often what shocks us is that which MAKES us have to THINK (which too often people don't enjoy because it takes effort).
But LADY IN THE CAGE was truly a hint of the increasing violence and growing state of social isolation in the United States in the 1960's and 1970's, and on to the future. Really, the film has to be seen to be appreciated. Instead of describing the plot for you, let me just suggest you watch the plot unfold without reading up on the plot before watching the movie. Ms. de Havilland's character survives, but the slow, creeping terror builds from the peacefulness of a beautiful, pleasant, sunny holiday to a psychotic's circus, all due to a few small coincidences that happen everyday. The real horror is psychological because this film reminds of us of how vulnerable humans are in general, and how vulnerable we are to the dependency on and failures of technology and industry, which can put us in danger. This film could be considered one of the early disaster films (on a very small scale), because like so many disaster films, some little situation starts small and slowly builds to a terrifying crescendo. As well, just like disaster films, the character(s) have to learn how to be shrewd and resourceful in order to survive...
Hopefully, Paramount Video will re-release this title, since having been out-of-print for some time has left the number of copies in the world greatly diminished. ""PLEEEEEEEESE! Paramount! PLEEEEEEEEEASE!""",1004400000,7,1821,4.973770491803279
251892,4,630021575X,"I finally found out what the name of this film is- After about 3 years of not knowing the name, and viewing it once, a long time ago on the late night classic movie channel. When I first saw it I was really surprised by the content, it being from the 60's. An interesting thriller to say the least, leaves one with an un-easy feeling after watching. This film must have some serious cult cred.- after all these years, and it being so violent for it's time. I enjoyed the film's intensity, and didn't even know that one of the thugs was a young James Caan??",995846400,,556,4.254716981132075
251893,1,630021575X,"Although it can probably be traced back to Billy Wilder's Sunset Boulevard, the 60's saw the advent of the Grand Guignol genre where venerable ladies whose box office potential outran their looks, were used in low budget camp comic-horror films. The most famous makers of these were Robert Aldrich and William Castle, with Whatever Happened to Baby Jane probably the most notorious, and the nadir being the execrable Angel, Angel Down We Go with Jennifer Jones. (If she hadn't been fired from the production, Judy Garland in Valley of the Dolls may have been the topper). Lady in a Cage was made in between Baby Jane and it's follow-up Hush, Hush Sweet Charlotte, so while this means it is a product of the period when these films were most popular, that doesn't mean it is of any greater quality. The screenplay by producer Luther Davis presents cliches of the wealthy and youth, with the only witticism being someone is subsequently referred to as ""the human being"" after they talk about the behaviour that separates humans from animals. There is a queasy assumption of something unhealthy about Olivia de Havilland's love for her son, who is her companion, with the suggestion that his implied sexual preference is a result of her smothering, and her being wealthy extends this to a limitless indulgence similar to Violet Venerable and her son Sebastian in Tennessee Williams' Suddenly Last Summer. de Havilland being a widow allows for the compensatory absent father, and being wealthy also means she deserves to be punished by robbery, according to Davis' thinking. He has de Havilland set upon by 3 groups of thiefs, to hammer the point home. The mother/son relationship is paralled with de Havilland and James Caan as the leader of the three kids who terrorise her, with Caan intrigued by de Havilland's cleavage, and a reference to Oedipus Rex. The hoodlum kids are like a parody of the trio from Rebel Without a Cause, with Jennifer Billingsley as a feral Natalie Wood, latino Rafael Campos as Sal Mineo, and Caan doing a Brando-imitation (with burping) in lieu of James Dean's Method. Davis presents these kids as pre-hippie soulless, without any imagination (as they intrude upon another thief's territory), or loyalty, but the indifferent passing traffic to de Havilland as she writhes on her front driveway also indicates that the kids lack of morality is representative of the general alienated impersonal society. de Havilland has an outdoor alarm for her malfunctioned home elevator that no one takes any notice of. So much for neighbourhood watch! This role is probably as significant to Caan's career as The Silver Chalice is to Paul Newman's, since it doesn't allow him to show any positive qualities, apart from his thick chest hair. By a perverse twist of empathy, de Havilland's casting somehow is less embarassing than either the more charismatic Bette Davis or Joan Crawford in their respective efforts in the genre. It's hard to know whether Grauman wants de Havilland to be deliberately awful when she recites poetry, or whether this is just an indication of his heavy-handedness. That this film has been banned is inexplicable since it's violence isn't unprecendented, and that it is considered prophetic the naive posturing of those who romanticise the past.",992390400,7,3286,5.031192660550459
251894,4,630021575X,"Only recently has the British film censor lifted the ban placed on this film in 1964, and even then, it can only be supplied to persons aged 18 or over. It is however quite a moral film showing how, as we become more and more ""caged"" in our own little egos, we become indifferent and hardened to the plight of others. The pursuit of materialistic consummerism results in a loss of human empathy as all values are reduced to mere commodity. Good acting and production values, as well as a score which also unsettles and disturbs, this film shocks and may offend, but it has a message we must all respond to, sooner or later.",988156800,5,623,4.426086956521739

Unfairly underappreciated psychological thriller was way ahead  of its time, but today it serves as a painfully accurate depiction of the  senseless violence that exists in our society. Acting, writing, direction,  and cinematography all achieve consistently high standards; Hollywood  legend Olivia de Havilland is perfection in one of her best latter-day  screen roles. Ann Sothern steals just about every scene she's in as an  overweight hustler, and James Caan effectively displays the animal  magnetism that later helped to make him a star.",968803200,14,631,5.43298969072165

A dead dog lays across the side of the road as passing cars stop momentarily and go their merry way once they've digested the grotesque sight.  These are the stark images shown over the opening credit preceding the film's horrific narrative. The main story as I see it serves as a metaphor for humanity or, if you will, inhumanity.  The film is a continuous nightmare demonstrating that as a race we are not very nice to one another.  Even the imperiled title character played by Olivia de Havilland is guilty of some sort of monstrosity consciously or unconsciously.  My quibble with the script devised by Luther Davis is it may be a tad heavy handed and somewhat mean spirited.  Regardless it is a riveting cinematic experience with terrific performances by de Havilland and a debuting James Caan as a sadistic punk.

252066,5,630021575X,"In Lady in a Cage, Olivia de Havilland (who was Errol Flynn's Maid Marion in The Adventures of Robin Hood) is teamed in this 1964 lurid thriller with James Caan, who leers and sneers and burps with disgusting energetic bravado in one of his first major roles. You get to see two performers from different eras acting together, in what some would find a repulsive narrative, both making the most of the over-the-top antics.

Warner Archives have preserved this film (which some might wish had remained forgotten) in a sharp widescreen print that captures the stark black and white images. As with most of the Warner films released on the Archives, the DVDs are essentially bare-bones discs, with only the original trailers on them, but the prints are often beautifully presented for people who love the art of films.

As a lover of movies or old TV series, it thrills me that they have managed to find a way to preserve films and performances that would otherwise be lost, and that they have taken the time to present the films in their original aspect ratios.

It isn't long before three young thrill seekers, whose leader is a young and angry James Caan, crash in and take over the pilfering of the house.

There are films that I've seen once and know I'll never bother with again.  [""Sleeping With The Enemy"" with Julia Roberts is one example].  ""Lady In A Cage"" exploits an invalid which is hardly a laughing matter.  True...Olivia's performance is a bit over-the-top, but imagine yourself trapped in a confined area watching goons invade your house.  James Caan is convincing, but I found myself getting a little twichy after the first 30 minutes.  Ann Sothern's appearance as ""The Goodyear Blimp"" made me wish she was doing her own TV shows instead of this mess!

Perhaps the definition of a good actor is his or her ability to make a thin plotline look better than it actually is?  But if you honestly need a sick horror movie to complete your day, there are certainly better films to watch!",1355097600,,909,4.672955974842767
252102,5,630021575X,"Luther Davis wrote and produced this dark, doom-laden 1964 movie.  For me it works on two levels.  In many ways it resembles a Hitchcock suspense movie.  Will the wealthy widow, trapped in a stalled elevator in her home during a long weekend, survive the confinement and the violence and threats she receives from drunks, thugs and hoodlums that invade her home. Watch Olivia de Havilland's face in the final fade out, however, and you'll realize that these events represent a woman being forced to re-evaluate her life.

Previously the focus of her life had been the adored, pampered, 30 year old son who lived with her.  During her caged ordeal she learns that her son wants to leave home, taking half the contents of the safe.  If his wishes are not met, he will shoot himself.

Hitherto, the woman had been living in a kind of enclosed world, unchanging, suspended between two levels of reality.  Now, however, miraculously freed from it, is the world outside the ""cage"" a better one?  Her home is trashed, she has been beaten up by a thug, and her son is threatening suicide.

I believe the final fade out poses this question.",1348358400,,1131,4.695431472081219

252104,4,630021575X,"We have all heard the phrase ""Man's inhumanity to man.""  It is one of those expressions that causes most of us to stop in our tracks and ponder how cruel people can be to each other.  Open any newspaper or listen to any newscast and you are constantly astonished at the lengths to which some individuals will go to injure other people.  ""Man's inhumanity to man"" is also a phrase that neatly sums up the theme of director Walter Grauman's eerie 1964 feature film ""Lady In A Cage"".  Screen veteran Olivia de Havilland stars as Cornelia Hilyard, a wealthy widow who is recuperating from a devastating injury and is still struggling to regain her mobility.  Unable to negotiate the stairs Cornelia must rely instead on a recently installed cage-like elevator to transport her between the two floors of her rather plush urban homestead.  Cornelia is a conniving and domineering woman who has succeeded in smothering her only son Malcolm (William Swan).  We learn that Malcolm is at his wits end and has finally summoned up the courage to request his share of the estate in a note to his mother.  He intends to strike out on his own and leave his mothers clutches once and for all when he returns from a business trip.  As the film opens, Malcolm asks his mother not to read the note he has written until after he has departed.

Through a rather unfortunate confluence of circumstances Cornelia is suddenly thrust into a disconcerting and potentially dangerous predicament.  The power line leading into her house has been damaged and the electricity cut off.  Our heroine suddenly finds herself trapped in a tiny elevator that resembles a prison cell roughly nine feet above the ground. To make matters worse it is going to be a hot and humid day in the city. At first Cornelia is not too concerned because she assumes that the power is out in the entire neighborhood and will be restored in short order.  But as the hours pass she comes to the frightening realization that this is not the case at all. She is reluctant to use the emergency alarm for fear of making a spectacle of herself but as the temperature continues to climb she finally decides to trigger it. The problem is that no one responds to the alarm.  The camera pans the street. We see a group of teenagers passing by in a convertible and workmen going about their daily business. Pedestrians walk by and a steady stream of traffic passes. Yet the alarm continues to clang and no one bothers to respond.  Are people deliberately ignoring it or are they just so wrapped up in whatever it is they are doing? No matter. Now Cornelia is becoming increasingly desperate.  Finally, she hears footsteps. Someone has come to rescue her!  Not so fast. The person who has invaded her home is not there to help her. He is there to take advantage of her rather unfortunate situation. He is a derelict named George L. Brady Jr. (Jeff Corey) and he intends to scoop up as many of his victims valuables as possible. Cornelia is positively petrified.  George ignores her impassioned pleas for help.  Instead, he grabs a toaster and a couple of other items and makes haste for a nearby hock shop.  But George has a big mouth and three punk teens led by one Randall Simpson O'Connor (James Caan) overhear him describing the situation at the Hilyard home.  Sensing an opportunity to wreak havoc the teens follow George back to the house.  These youngsters are bitter and violent and full of hatred and are seeking to wreak vengeance on someone, anyone.  Spotting the terrified Cornelia in her cage they merely snicker at her predicament and threaten to kill her. Cornelia is flabbergasted at the events that are unfolding in her own home in front of her very eyes. ""What kind of animals are these?"" she wonders aloud. Be prepared to have your own faith in humankind challenged as you watch this film.

""Lady In A Cage"" is a splendid psychological drama that features a compelling performance by Olivia de Havilland. Her role in this film would remind you a lot of Jimmy Stewart's character in Alfred Hitchcock's classic ""Rear Window"".  With the camera fixed on her for a substantial portion of the film viewers are afforded a unique opportunity to examine up close and personal  her facial expressions and body language as she reacts to what is taking place.  We are all eyewitnesses to the full range of her emotions.  Meanwhile in what is the first significant role of his motion picture career a very young James Caan is thoroughly convincing as a badass teen who has spent most of his life in state institutions.  Devoid of love and people who really care about him Randall Simpson O'Connor is lashing out at everyone and everything around him. It just breaks your heart to see what has become of the lad.  Just before the conclusion of the film one of the other teenagers discovers Malcolm's letter and reads it aloud to Cornelia.  Confronted with her own egregious sins she suddenly realizes that in many ways she is really no better than the individuals who have invaded her home.  I must warn you that ""Lady In A Cage"" contains several extremely disturbing scenes and can be quite depressing at times. But on balance ""Lady In A Cage"" is a film well worth seeing and was certainly way ahead of its time when it was first released back in 1964. Highly recommended!",1292889600,6,5312,4.666309012875536
252105,5,630021575X,"In the early 60's hollywood churned out films that would fall under the title of ""hag-horror"" or older women-in-peril films. The genre's explosion began with What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? and most of those films starred the aged and heavy handed Joan Crawford. Lady in a Cage was the lesser known of the genre but the social commentary that it held then, still holds an impact now. The violence in Lady in a Cage is exaggerated for the time period but is commonly read about in today's newspapers. The old woman in peril (DeHavilland) viciously battles mental and physical attacks from a preaching wino, a aged prostitute and three grimy hoodlums all while trapped in her own house, in an elevator (the cage) on a hot summer afternoon. Films like these spawned into a more bizarre type of films in the late 60's called ""roughies"" in which the damsel in distress became a young beauty instead of easy targeted elderly. I highly recommend this movie for the fans of the above mentioned genre's or even for fan's of Lynch and Cronenberg.",1266192000,2,1037,4.7032967032967035
252106,5,630021575X,"After the success of ""Whatever Happened to baby Jane?"" movie studios were falling over themselves to find a film similar in story and acting content. Suddenly it was in for films to feature former movie stars in situations of peril, as both Joan Crawford and Bette Davis, stars of ""Baby Jane..."", proved bankable at the boxoffice. The most successful and best film in the ""older lady"" genre that came out after ""Baby Jane"" was ""Lady in a Cage"" starring Olivia DeHavilland who plays an older woman trapped in her elevator, a cage if you will, on a hot summer day. Her performance is excellent as Olivia expresses the pain her character faces while being trapped in a human coffin. Her nightmare is just beginning, as a homeless man and former prostitute break into her home and try to steal her possessions. Just when we think things couldn't get any worse for the DeHavilland character, three more thugs come into her house, shattering the older woman's life and belongings to shreads. The violence and the graphic scenes are extremely well depicted, and it is hard to believe a movie like this was actually made in the early '60's. The film explores the human need for material things, and its ultimate destruction of those people who prove so greedy.
 I came across this film on-line one night and watched it on Youtube and couldn't belive how great it was. The writing and direction by Luther Davis is first-rate, and the acting ensemble is the best Hollywood has to offer. Olivia is superb, and look for a very sexual and young James Caan, from ""Misery"" and ""The Godfather"", who plays Randall, the mastermind behind the animal orgy! Ann Southern has a supporting role as the hooker, and acting teacher Jeff Corey, who trained Cher, plays the wino.
 Joan Crawford was the original choice to play the DeHavilland role, but turned it down reasoning that she had already played a character whose life was in danger at the hands of others in ""Baby Jane"". ""Lady In A Cage"" marks the second time in movie history that Olivia DeHavilland took over a role from Miss Crawford, with the other being Miriam in ""Hush, Hush...Sweet Charlotte"".
 The ""Lady In A Cage"" DVD is now out-of-print and is very hard to find, but the high cost that sellers are asking for it is worth it.

252107,3,630021575X,"Even for today's standards, this film does a rather decent job of realistically portraying a home invasion burglary but without resorting to gratuitous violence. The films' intruders are as savage as we expect them to be and partially what makes them so frightening is their lack of empathy and decency. They terrorize the sole inhabitant, played by de Havilland, who is stuck mid-air in her private elevator. Due to a prior hip injury, she cannot escape from the elevator and has lost the ability to communicate with the outside. She can only watch as vagrants and intruders plunder her home, verbally abuse and try to attack her. What makes this film compelling is how this useless woman is able to survive with all these creative obstacles in place. James Caan, the gangs' leader, is the most convincing of all the characters and gives this film it's strength. The weakest part of this film is unfortunately the one character we're supposed to care about: the lady in the cage. At times, her intellectual rambling and overly dramatic delivery was irritating and her actions were equally ridiculous. It must have been difficult for a veteran actress like de Havilland to justify her characters' ineffectual behavior. In her defense though, it could be argued that her actions mirror those of people who are continually subjected to chaos or extreme terror; not knowing how to react or if they should get involved. Probably one of the biggest themes supported in this picture, especially in the beginning and end sequences, is the trait shared by the lawless and the law-abiding: the perversion of watching someone in pain and the inability or unwillingness to act. Overall, this film had a good, suspenseful pace and combined with a realistic setting is one of the better cult classics.",1231632000,2,1788,4.963333333333333

I instantly loved it and it became an instant favorite, even though I had only seen the last half of it.

I had tried to get it on DVD for a while, but found out that it had been discontinued, and had to buy it on ebay. A great movie with excellent acting, and a wonderful script. Olivia de Havilland plays a handicapped woman who broke her hip recently and has to resort to going up and downstairs in her small private elevator. Her grown son (who lives with her) goes away for a holiday weekend, but shortly after he leaves, there is a mysterious power outage and she is trapped in her elevator. She then sounds her emergency alarm bell, but only to attract a group of thugs who break into her house and vandalize her stuff. This was one of James Caan's first movies (here he plays the nasty guy named Randall). Jeff Corey is brilliant as George L. Brady, Jr., who is the ""old wino"" or also known as ""Repent, Repent, Repent"", because he has the word stamped on his hands several times. Ann Sothern's performance is brilliant, as well. It saddens me that this movie is no longer on DVD, but if you want a copy, just get a used one.

The scenes at the end (which I won't reveal for spoiling them) are laughable.

The rest of the characters in the cast are throughly unlikeable!!  You long to see them all dispatched.  All in all this is a twisted film....especially the allusions to deHavilland being in love with her son (who is obviously gay and dominated by him).

252150,4,630021575X,"LADY IN A CAGE is a thriller that exploits the very subject matter it is trying to expose in such a grim manner. A wealthy lady (OLIVIA DE HAVILLAND) is recovering from a hip operation that forces her to use a self-operated ""lift"" in her home where she is surrounded by luxury items and a self-absorbed but orderly existence. She is exactly the sort of person unprepared for the invasion of a group of thugs who make her life a living hell when they intrude upon her household in the crudest possible way.

When the film first opened, it was received poorly by the film critics of the day who lambasted it for its graphic depiction of senseless violence and viewed it as no more than a cheap horror flick. However, the years have been kinder to it than anyone could have expected. Perhaps de Havilland was right when she judged that the film was ""way ahead of its time"" in dealing with this sort of subject matter because today it is much more highly regarded for what it is trying to say beneath the graphic brutality.

JAMES CAAN is the ruthless leader of the pack, obviously a delinquent of the first order who enjoys humiliating and playing mind games with the victimized woman in the cage. It is he who exposes her as a not very sympathetic woman who has smothered her son with affection to the point where he has left a suicide note addressed to her as ""Darling"". Caan's frank dialog is particularly rough here and his shoving around of the defenseless woman is not a pleasant sight to witness.

JEFF COREY overacts mercilessly as a vagrant with a thirst for any liquor he can get his hands on and ANN SOTHERN does an effective supporting role as a blowsy prostitute not above taking advantage of what looks to be a good situation. The less said about RAFAEL CAMPOS and JENNIFER BILLINGSLEY the better. Their overripe work is almost embarrassing at times.

It's obvious that Luther Davis was exposing the flaws in society that certainly came to the surface during the '60s, shortly before the Manson murders became widely known. The baby boomers of the drug generation certainly get their share of blame here.

Summing up: Not for the faint of heart, but a searing expose of certain societal ills in a not-too-subtle way. Olivia at least is highly convincing in what must have been an exhausting role to play and a most unusual one.",1180828800,3,2338,4.583732057416268
252151,4,630021575X,"An intense and unnerving movie experience, LADY IN A CAGE is not for the faint-hearted.  The story revolves around Mrs Cornelia Hilyard (Olivia de Havilland), a woman trying to peacefully recover from a hip-replacement within the confines of her home.  On a very hot day, she becomes stuck in her elevator, and is terrorised by a group of criminals and hoods who break in.

Ann Sothern turns in a fabulous performance as Sade, a hard-bitten prostitute; whilst James Caan--in only his second film--seems to be channeling Brando as he plays the menacing gang leader Randall Simpson O'Connell.  Jennifer Billingsley plays the vile gang moll, Elaine.

Olivia de Havilland is heartbreaking as the terrorised Mrs Hilyard.  This was the second 'scream queen' role which she played in 1964 (the other is ""Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte"").  In the wrong hands this material could have become melodramatic, but de Havilland always was a very truthful and instinctual actress, and the same is true for her performance here.

Whenever I watch LADY IN A CAGE, I'm always struck by the notion that it's the clash of ""Old Hollywood"" and ""New Hollywood"".  By that, I mean that you have two of the great Hollywood women--Olivia de Havilland and Ann Sothern--clashing literally and physically with much younger actors for whom their movies and work would have meant absolutely nothing.  This film was made on the cusp of changes within Hollywood, too.  Shortly the MPAA ratings system would be set into place, allowing movies to go further than they had ever been allowed to in the past.

So much of this film is completely unsettling, particularly as this pre-dates the Manson killings (and this film features scenes which would eerily echo in reality).

Certainly no feel-good movie, but worthy of any classic film collection.  The DVD sadly does not feature any extras.",1177804800,4,1852,5.0493421052631575

into the B&W horror genre of the 60's.

I've always been a fan of Olivia de Havilland

so as I was reading the description and reviews

I wasn't sure if I really wanted to see this film.

Even while knowing that she's a great actress

it was hard for me to imagine her in such a bizarre role.

I was happy to see that she gave an excellent performance.

Unlike other movies of the genre, ""Lady in a Cage"" comes

off classy and refined, in spite of the violent subject matter.

There are no unconvincing actors to be found and the

suspense level puts this movie right on par with Hitchcock.

In fact, I was most suprised at how suspenseful this was

because the general plot description sounded so basic. Great

acting and creative cinematography puts the movie at the

helm of the genre.

The movie begins with a deceptively wholesome opening reminiscent

of a 1950's family sitcom and it actually never loses that feeling;

however, characters enter, plunder, and exit the home, thus providing

the action and suspense.  At times, De havilland's overly

dramatic acting delivery seems a little contrived, but it's

the same style that won her two Oscars. Upon closer

examination one can see how her Puritan

character creates a glaring contrast to the

brutal juveniles, the repentant alcholic thief, and

the opportunistic female hustler. It's this contrast

that sets the scene for a heightened suspense factor.

This movie is great for purchase or rental.  It's guaranteed

to provoke an endless range of emotions in the viewer.",1172534400,3,1572,4.757462686567164

""Lady In A Cage"" is clearly the vision of its producer/writer, Luther Davis. He has an agenda the size of Los Angeles, and he piles it on high, for nerve-wracking, disturbing effect.

I haven't seen a movie in a long time that disturbed me like this did. And it's symptomatic of a number of downright-sick and mean films from the early '60s. It's much like 1963's ""The Sadist"" in its unremitting anger, violence and hopelessness.

The performances are caricatures, and all are dialed up past 11. The leering, mugging and telegraphing of the actors are all in accord. Olivia DeHavilland's performance, ironically, is the most low-key in the entire film.

One weird thing about the film: what happens to Ann Sothern's character? She's locked in a room by James Caan, and that's the last we see or hear of her. Presumably, she survives... or did I blink and miss something?

This Luther Davis cat must have had one chip on his shoulder. ""Lady In A Cage"" is fascinating, absurd, sickening and highly anti-social filmmaking.",1169510400,4,1213,4.926470588235294

It is indeed like an extended episode of 'Alfred Hitchcock Presents' or 'The Twilight Zone', or even more like 'Night Gallery' for the 'horror' aspect of the story.

De Havilland is trapped between floors during a power outage, and a number of low-life characters enter her home to steal, terrorize and make our caged lady's life a living hell. The young James Caan is one of the really bad guys, and the wonderful Ann Southern is one of the exploiters who ends up being terrorized by Caan and company.  The titles are 60's brilliant and the film score does the suspense proud. De Havilland is over-the-top hammy in many scenes and quite good in others;  that's the beauty of these shockers when they have serious performers of a certain age and era doing a little Grand Guignol number. This one runs a tight 94 minutes and the time really flies, which is a tribute to the skill of director Walter Grauman. Here's a wonderful black and white camp shocker that is quite creepy in retrospect. De Havilland, who is around 88 today, is the only surviving female lead of the four films I mentioned above.

 The story is in black and white, and this adds to the mood, like in Alfred Hitchcocks ""Psycho"".  Sure, they could've used color for this 1964 film, but you'll see for yourself why the lack of color, matches the noir and bizarre mood here.

 DeHavilland is over-dramatic, but superb too, as the ""Lady"" of the title, her facial expressions are so fitting of her consuming exasperation at the frustrating situation.  You can feel the sweat as she swelters in the summer heat, trapped helplessly.  DeHavilland also has her son Malcomb,  from whom she ponders a letter while trapped.  She finds out that sonny boy,  whom she idolizes with a devout reverence, hates her.  She agonizes over his plea ""Release me from your love"", leading to the great exclamation ""I AM a MONSTER!""Wait, it gets even better.

 As DeHavilland rings her alarm relentlessly, hoping someone will save her, she attracts the attention of an old pathetic semi-mute wino, wandering around the neighborhood.  He comes into the house, ignores DeHavillands' pleas, and steals her wine cellar contents instead.  He leaves, and comes back with a shady lady played by Ann Southern, who further ransacks the house.  DeHavilland can't believe what's happening.  That's just the start.

 The nerve jangling intensity increases, upon the arrival of three beatnik punks, one geeky weirdo clownish guy, a positively filthy looking girl, and her abusive group leader boyfriend, an early role for a then 26 year old future star, James Caan.  When this trio of trouble enters, the real show begins, as they let Southern and the wino know, they're in charge.  All sorts of games begin, especially wild, is the psycho-sexual headgames an insidious Caan inflicts upon DeHavilland, as he enters the ""cage"" and starts in on her son, and the kind of mother he speculates she is.  Caan is slimy, sinister and completely lacking in moral compunction, as are his two cohorts.  You will watch this with a very uneasy feeling and you will be left with that feeling after viewing this as well.  For a movie that was released in 1964, it is even shocking by TODAY'S standards.  Way ahead of it's genre in that era, it stands up to the test of time quite well as a high quality, unique suspense thriller.

 ""Lady In A Cage"" is a sad social commentary about isolation, cruelty, and dysfunctional sociopaths that is so far ahead of it's time,  it must be seen, to be believed.
