2326863,5,B0009WFFPO,"Great production quality on this dvd. Bright set, good music, and excellent instruction. Chris Frytag had perfect cuing which made the workout very doable. There was a great deal of variety in this workout and my muscles were challenged. A perfect intermediate level cardio and toning workout. Good job Prevention magazine!!",1128988800,15,324,5.372549019607843
2326864,5,B0009WFFPO,"It's fun and great workout!  It's 100% satisfaction after 45 minutes of workout.  Within two weeks, I already start seeing result :)

It contains 6 circuits, and each circuit has 3 minutes of cardio workout, 2 minutes of strength work, and 1 minute of abs exercise. Each circuit has theme such as dancing and boxing, which makes this workout very much fun.",1128643200,12,356,4.709677419354839
2326865,5,B0009WFFPO,"Wow, I've done this workout twice and love it.  It combines it all, aerobics, strength training with weights and core work (abs).

It's called 3-2-1 because it has 6 circuits comprised of 3 minutes aerobics, 2 min strength and 1 minute floor work focusing on core and abs.  Each circuit has a different theme and works a different body part.  Themes include dance type aerobics, tae-bo style kicks and punches, and an absolutely beautiful power yoga sequence near the end.

It's great to get the aerobics and strength and abs all in one 45 minute or so workout and you WILL be sweating and feel you had a great workout by the end unless you take it down a notch. (They do suggest beginner modifications if you are not up to full throttle just yet).

I'm a loyal Prevention mag. reader and that's why I ordered this video and I'm not disappointed.",1127692800,147,846,4.532894736842105
2326892,4,B0009WFFPO,I love Prevention and their workouts but this one was just ok to me.  Not sure why.  The instruction is ok but maybe its that I don't like her style or something. It is an effective workout but its not one a do a lot.,1415491200,,217,3.8

2326895,4,B0009WFFPO,"The circuit structure really works for me. I don't get bored by too many reps of any one exercise, but the six circuits get my heart rate up and I feel like I've worked pretty hard. Of all my workout CDs, this is the one I pick up first.",1401753600,,237,3.857142857142857

2326897,4,B0009WFFPO,"I like it. I have been using the Leslie Sansone DVDs for a few years and wanted to change my workout a little so I tried this circuit dvd and I can see a difference already, it helps tone your muscles and gives you cardio all at the same time.  I also like that you can do just a couple circuits or all 6 at once, depending on how much time you have.  I would recommend this to anyone that wants to change there routine or would like to lose a few inches.",1395360000,4,455,3.881720430107527
2326898,5,B0009WFFPO,"I love this workout!  You get both a strength and cardio workout in at the same time in about 40 minutes.  I am in very good shape and still get a great workout from this video, but I also do it with older women from my church and they are able to modify the intensity and get an appropriate workout as well!  Love it.  Anything Chris Freytag is amazing.",1393027200,2,354,4.086956521739131

2326912,5,B0009WFFPO,"I have two of her DVD's from Prevention and I love them both.  Very motivating and easy to get through, and then feel VERY good about it.

2326913,4,B0009WFFPO,"This dvd does several short sessions of cardio, strength training, and abs exercises.  Each three minute session of cardio is followed by a two minute strength training session and then a one minute abs session.  i believe there are eight complete rounds for a total of 49 minutes.",1378771200,,281,4.833333333333333
2326914,3,B0009WFFPO,I liked the instructor. She was very motivating and keeps things moving. Easy to follow and just the right amount of time in each exercise so you have a chance to do it well but you don't get bored. I thought it was low intermediate so I agree with the reviewer that it was hard to feel like I got a good workout.,1378166400,2,313,3.984126984126984

2326916,5,B0009WFFPO,"It is a great workout DVD, with clear instruction and modification for beginners. You can get a great workout in 30 minutes or more if you choose. The only thing that I don't like is there is not a clear 5 minute warm-up even though she states it. The workout starts off at a high pace and for me it is too much too soon in the workout, but once I get warmed up its great, Lots of Fun.",1366588800,,385,3.8860759493670884
2326917,4,B0009WFFPO,"Fairly easy to follow along, but sometimes if you're in a downward position, the vocal queues to change position aren't as fast as the physical movements.  Overall a good routine to fit in two to three times a week.",1366156800,,215,4.512820512820513
2326918,5,B0009WFFPO,I have several of the prevention fitness workouts. I love them all and when I keep up on them my legs look fabulous. They work. Made for real people not celebrities that have personal trainers and chefs dictating their lives. You'll start seeing results in about 2 weeks. After a month you can start buying new clothes...,1365638400,,321,4.649122807017544
2326919,5,B0009WFFPO,"This workout had me laughing and smiling the whole time! More fun than any workout I've done and easy enough that I could work out for the full 45 minutes, much longer than my usual 20 minute workout. I admit I didn't feel any ""burn"" the next day, but I think that is b/c this DVD is mostly cardio. It definitely had me sweating. I usually do Jillian Michaels, who makes my whole body hurt, but her workouts are so hard and painful that I DREAD doing them. The ""Prevention"" DVD is one that I can see myself doing every day, and it actually makes me look forward to my workout!",1364601600,2,576,4.198198198198198

2326964,5,B0009WFFPO,"Sometimes I have a short attention span when it comes to workouts, so this one is perfect for me.  In case it isn't obvious, the 3-2-1 part refers to the minutes it takes for each segment: 3 minutes of cardio, 2 minutes of strength training, and 1 minute of ab work.  The ab work is a little advanced for me at this point, but I do what I can.  It's a total of 36 minutes, not including warm-up and cool down.  A great way to get up and get your body moving!  Also, Chris Freytag doesn't annoy me like a lot of workout hosts do.",1312502400,,528,3.9904761904761905
2326965,5,B0009WFFPO,"This 3-2-1 workout has 6 sections of 3 minutes of cardio, 2 minutes of strength training and 1 minute of core work. It works upper and lower body, core and gives enough cardio to get your heart rate up and keep it up throughout the entire workout. This is a very well thought out workout with modifications for more advanced and easier exercises. The cardio can be all low impact if you want and you will still get your heart rate up. This is a workout anyone can do.

Setting: The DVD is set in an open workout room.

Music: The music is instrumental and not exciting nor irritating.

Crew: There are 2 people working out with Chris. One lady demonstrates more advance moves and one shows easier modifications.

Equipment: Hand weights and a mat.

Instructor: Chris is nice and easy to work out with over and over. She cues well and is easy to follow.",1278979200,,852,4.435897435897436
2326966,5,B0009WFFPO,"I just have to say I get bored easily with work outs however this is so entertaining and the workout really - Works you out-
 I am completely satisfied with this and will continue to use for many years to come.",1266019200,2,210,4.121951219512195
2326967,5,B0009WFFPO,"I admit, years ago, I couldn't warm up to Chris Freytag. I was too stuck on Cathe and didn't give her a fair chance. However, recently, I'm discovering that she has indeed some really good, challenging and fun workouts that make very good use of your time and this is one of those. I completely disagree with some of the reviewers here that say it's for beginners. While a beginner can modify the moves, overall this is an intermediate workout that gives you very good cardio and weights intervals. To make it harder for me, I used 10 to 12 lb. dumbbells and sometimes added a few more compound moves and high impact to this routine and got an awesome challenging workout. Time just flew by and it felt great.",1255219200,7,709,4.461538461538462
2326968,4,B0009WFFPO,"Fifty minutes flies by with this workout because of all the variety. In addition to the targeted toning sections, each cardio interval has a different theme: classic aerobics, ""ball games"", dancing, kickboxing, bootcamp, and power yoga. The yoga doesn't really get your heart rate up, but it's in the last circuit so I think of it as the prelude to the cool-down. As always, Chris is excited, inspiring, and genuine.",1252800000,4,416,4.957142857142857
2326969,5,B0009WFFPO,"This is my favorite all around workout DVD. I enjoy a variety--from hula to kickboxing, but this is the one I recommend to those who ask me what first exercise DVD to buy. It has a great balance of different types of exercise and best of all, everytime you think you don't want to go on--because of being tired or bored--it switches. The segments are bite size and it's easy to convince yourself that you can do just one more. Highly recommended. I wish Prevention would make more of these 3-2-1 workouts on DVD.",1250294400,9,512,4.457446808510638
2326970,5,B0009WFFPO,"This work out covers it all for me, if you have time and energy, you can do all the segments together, if you're running, you just do your one 6 minute workout!",1247702400,3,160,4.03125
2326971,4,B0009WFFPO,"The moves are easy to follow, time goes by fast. I think a beginer would enjoy this workout, intermediate and experienced can use this as one of those lighter workout days. As with any exercise if you bump it up a bit you can get more out of this DVD.",1242345600,2,251,4.04
2326992,3,B0009WFFPO,"I was excited to get this dvd, thinking it would be a powerhouse of a workout in a short amount of time. The variety of each segment is great, you won't get bored with the routines buts it certainly isn't very challenging. I did the entire workout without ever breaking a sweat. For a more challenging circuit workout try Jillian Michael's 30 Day Shred, it is a grueling 20 minutes that goes by fast but you will feel it.",1242172800,3,421,4.341772151898734
2326993,2,B0009WFFPO,"I enjoyed this video the first few times I did it when returning to working out after an absence.  It does have some fun segments such as the salsa dance but overall it is not challenging for me after working out at the gym for a few weeks and my fitness has improved.  I pulled it out today because I needed a quick workout but after doing other things my opinion of it has changed.  I didn't feel that the cardio or strength intervals were long enough to do much good, I'd just be getting into it and the instructor would move on to something else.  Also, the weight repetitions are done too quickly; I had difficulty keeping up with the tempo without swinging the weights and compromising good form.  Many of the weight exercises are isolation moves instead of compound, there are more effective ways to strength train.  This is definitely a beginner workout and one that anyone who is serious about getting fit will quickly outgrow.",1240099200,3,936,4.541666666666667
2326994,5,B0009WFFPO,"I rented this video from the library and as soon as I was finished, I came onto Amazon and ordered it.  I like Chris Freytag, she is a good instructor and she is upbeat.  I like the different combinations(I especially like playing catch in one of the segments)  I worked up the sweat that I am used to working up.  Great video!",1239667200,2,327,4.225806451612903
2326995,4,B0009WFFPO,"Although I do not find myself using this video very often, I'm still giving it four stars because I believe that beginners could benefit from it.  I exercise regularly and am already in good shape, so I didn't feel that it gave me as good of a workout as I wanted.  That being said here are the good things about this DVD.

Circuit training is great because you don't get bored.  There are six circuits and each one focuses on a different muscle group for the strength-training section of the circuit, and you also get a different style of cardio each time.  But, as mentioned before, I'd really only recommend this to beginners because the cardio is so short that you really don't have a chance to get your heart rate up.  Also, if you're the type who doesn't really look forward to excersising this workout seems to go by very fast, probably due to the circuits.  The production is good, and the instructor gives decent instruction.  The only real problem I have with this video is that, to me, Chris Freytag is pretty annoying.  One of those overly-perky, ""Come on!  You can do it!  Don't stop now!  Keep going!!"" types.  But a lot of people who've written reviews haven't seemed to mind that, so perhaps it's just me.",1236729600,,1221,4.52054794520548
2326996,5,B0009WFFPO,"Love, love, love this workout DVD.  Have been using it for 2wks, combined with the companion 3-2-1 Weight Loss Plan, and have already seen some great results.  Very easy to follow along and a challenge for every level. I'm recommending it to my friends.",1231632000,3,253,4.7272727272727275
2326997,5,B0009WFFPO,"I enjoy Chris Freytag as an instructor as she always cues you on the next move. I like the variety and the switching between different routines. This workout was moderate but, not overly intense, keeping you aerobic to burn fat. Having purchased several workout dvds, this is another keeper for my collection.",1231632000,2,309,4.961538461538462
2326998,5,B0009WFFPO,"circuit workouts give maximum results by both burning calories and building muscle (so you also, then, burn more calories even at reast via boosting your metabolism and caloric needs). I, therefore, lean towards the videos that follow this as every current medical conditioning study shows it's the optimum way to get into shape in the least amount of time.

But a bad circuit workout does no one any good...and, thankfull, this one is a GOOD one with great firming moves and excellent cardio.

The instructor is excellent with cueing and ensuring you do each move correctly and smoothly, my Polar Heart Rate monitor is an F11 so it tells me not only how many calories I burned, but what percent of those calories were fat...and this video delievered both according to my monitor in burning the cals, as well as my enjoyment of doing it and ease of which I could.  A fave.",1228953600,4,872,4.686274509803922
2326999,4,B0009WFFPO,"This is a great video if you want a really quick workout that gets your whole body.  Unfortunately, it really isn't that difficult and there is a lot of time swithching positions for each segment.  If you're in a hurry it gets the job done but I wouldn't depend on it for really getting in shape.",1226793600,,296,4.267857142857143
2327000,5,B0009WFFPO,I absolutely love this dvd.  It gives me the interval training I desire.  It works every muscle in your body.  I am moderately active and trying to lose some weight---this dvd is definately going to help.  Try it!,1221955200,,213,4.526315789473684
2327001,5,B0009WFFPO,This is a really good body sculpting workout.  It breaks things into different body parts with a short cardio in-between each weight lifting set.  It works the entire body and makes it fun in the process. Chris is a very good instructor and easy to follow. Recommend to anyone wanting to get started with weight training or wanting to get back into weight training.  I had been away from it for awhile and found it to be very effective.,1220832000,,436,4.493670886075949
2327028,5,B0009WFFPO,"I loved this workout. It's a good all round workout. I read a lot of reviews and wanted to use a video to do the workouts instead of reading them (I own this book Prevention 3-2-1). I own a lot of workout videos because I get bored easily.

At first it doesn't seem like a lot of work, but about 2/3 of the way through the sweat is dripping off me.  I find the toning segments for the lower body to be a good challenge.

2327030,5,B0009WFFPO,I love all the work outs by Chris Freytag and Prevention.  What I really like about this one is it is broken up into 6 minute workouts for specific ares.  You can do them all or just a few if you don't have much time.,1213488000,,217,3.8

It's a bit of a fooler since it isn't crazy intense but it does get you moving and sweating.

Not only am I getting great results, but I love the fact that it moves through each section so quickly I don't have time to get bored.  It consists of 6 circuit workouts for 6 different areas of the body.  The moves are easy to follow from the first viewing and they're pretty enjoyable.  There's a yoga-inspired segment, a kick-boxing segment, a ""basic training"" segment and a sport segment and some standard aerobics.  Each cardio segment lasts 3 minutes and the strength and ab circuits complement the aerobic routines quite well.

2327063,5,B0009WFFPO,"I agree with most of the other reviewers, this is a good DVD, especially if exercising isn't your favorite part of the day!  It is broken down into 5 minute segments with 3 minutes of cardio, 2 minutes of weight resistance and 1 minute of ab work.

The segments focus on various parts of the body: legs, chest, arms, etc.  You can do the whole thing or whatever you have time for and in one routine you get a little bit of everything.  You don't have to shuffle DVDs around to get a complete workout.

The other thing that I like is that the only equipment required is a pair of light hand weights and even that is optional as one of the participants does a modified version of everything without weights.

This is probably not for hard core exercise fanatics but again, if you don't look forward to exercising this DVD is for you.",1181520000,,831,4.329032258064516

True, I am a senior citizen, but have been exercising regularly for a while.  My husband thinks it's a good workout also.  The only part I don't like is the yoga circuit at the end.

(great if you don't have much time to excersice) DVD includes cardio, toning for arms, shoulders, back, thighs, butt, abs and some nice cooldown excersices. Chris Freytag is real good on keeping you motivated without being annoying. I've had it for about 5 months and haven't gotten bored yet, since each circuit lasts for so little and then changes to a different section of the body, you don't get the feeling that you're doing the same thing over and over again.

Even 2 months ago as a beginner I was able to do the whole thing, and now that I'm more advanced, I follow the instructor in the back doing the advanced workout.

2327093,3,B0009WFFPO,"I was excited to do this workout given the other great reviews here.  Going into it fully expecting to love it, I was a bit disappointed that it was not more intense.

I like the idea of the ""circuit training"" aspect, but unfortunately there was too much time in between each piece, and I felt that my heartrate dropped back to normal after each section.  I thought the whole point of circuit training was to keep your heartrate up the entire time while moving continuously with very little pause between one exercise and the next?  This DVD had too much time in between for the ""graphics"" showing what was coming up in the next section (assuming this is because the DVD is intended to be viewable as a complete 49 minute workout session or as individual sessions targeted for each body area if you have less time).

The workout runs as follows: Each body part is targeted in its own circuit - Six complete circuits - and each one has three minutes of cardio, two minutes of toning and one minute of corework (abs).  The toning sections are each individually targeted: legs, chest, butt, back, arms and shoulders.  Sounds good, right?  In theory!

On a positive note, I DID find that this 49 minute workout seemed to go very quickly - not sure if that was because of how the format was much less repetitive than most workouts (each section is different, with different music and exercises), or whether it felt quick because it just wasn't vigorous enough to make me feel like I had done anything too difficult or strenuous by the time it was over.

I am NOT really at an advanced or intermediate level as far as working out goes, and I am definitely used to more sweating and moving than I got from this workout.  I'm going to give it a few more run-throughs (a week or so, once a day) to see if I end up liking it better. (Everyone else who reviewed it here seemed to, so I am thinking I'm missing something and will glady give it another chance!)  We'll also see if it passes the true test and produces results: weight loss and increased fitness level.

I'll report back after a bit more of a trial period. Stay tuned....",1163030400,16,2123,4.454780361757106
2327094,5,B0009WFFPO,"This is such a fun workout. At first I didn't like it because the format is different that many other workouts I have, but after doing it a few times it's become one of my favorite programs to use on days when I have more time. What's nice about it, too, is you can only do 4 of the circuits if you don't have time for the full program. There's a lot of energy in the ladies leading it and there are variations for those who can't do high impact, straight leg pushups or don't want to do all of the circuits, for example. If you are a moderate level exerciser, this is a good program. It's not intense, but makes you feel you worked out when you're done.",1162080000,7,654,4.077519379844961

2327121,5,B0009WFFPO,"This workout is really great.  With the different circuits the time goes by quickly because you don't feel like you are constantly repeating the same steps over and over again.  I don't generally like the workouts that start out slowly then work up to a long routine since I tend to get bored easily.  After completing this workout for the first time I felt great!  I have done this workout several times since then and still enjoy.  I just don't get bored.

I also like the fact that this workout circuits through each part of the body.  I don't feel like anything gets overworked even if I do the workout more than two days in a row.

The instructor is great, enthusiastic without being overbearing. Get this DVD is you want something that is fast-paced but easy to do.",1158796800,5,771,4.496402877697841

2327125,4,B0009WFFPO,I think this is a wonderful workout.  It works absolutely every area of the body so you get the benefit of a complete workout.  The only problem I had with the video is that there isn't a section in the beginning describing the movements they're going to use.  I tried doing the workouts along the first time I put the video in and couldn't keep up b/c I didn't know which movements they were going to do next.  I ended up sitting down and just watching the whole thing once all the way through so I knew what to expect the next time around and that was a big help.  The second time was much better.  It really is a powerful workout and I'm already seeing benefits from it.  :-),1144454400,9,678,4.1692307692307695
2327126,5,B0009WFFPO,"I really like this video, and here's why:

Chris Freytag is a great instructor. She keeps the energy up without being obnoxious or overly peppy.

The variety of the sections is great, different music and moves that are fit to real life exercise (basketball, dancing, etc.).  Each section ends on the mat, incorporating abs into all sections so that it is thorough but not overwhelming.

The 3-2-1 format keeps things moving quickly. I don't ever get bored during the workout, and if I get to an exercise that I don't like to do, I know it won't last long and I can stick to it.

Based on this one video alone, I am going to buy more Prevention DVDs and maybe even Chris' own series.",1142380800,13,682,4.424
2327127,5,B0009WFFPO,"I was pleasantly surprised with this workout! I was skeptical as to how effective a 3-minute aerobic, 2-minute weights, and 1-minute core workout would be... but it was great! I was sweating, my heart-rate was escalating, and by the end, I felt energized and strong! The instructor is delightful (very encouraging and fun), and the mood and music are upbeat. There are even tips that scroll at the bottom of the screen to help make it the most effective (breathing, positioning techniques, etc.) After the workout, one of the women demonstrates other useful relaxation and massage techniques. I am very happy with this purchase, and will use this circuit often as part of my workout regime!",1141776000,23,690,4.956896551724138
2327128,5,B0009WFFPO,I've done all the videos and very few are at the level of this one.  The instuctor gives excellent cueing and the movements are well choregraphed.  This is the first video in a long time that I found the pace to be correct for me.  It has a suberb mixture of strength and cardio.  I can't wait to do it again!!,1141689600,2,310,4.032786885245901
2327129,5,B0009WFFPO,"I love reading Prevention magazine!!  It is always so interesting, entertaining, informative, etc.  When I read about the 3-2-1 workout, I was intrigued and wanted to find out more.  I read the reviews on Amazon and thought, why not give it a try?!  I always feel more energetic when I workout, but because of my busy work schedule, I can't always make it to the gym.  I really prefer to workout at home with videos anyway, so now I have no excuse not to get out of bed!!

 This is a good workout for your whole body incorporating weights and cardio.  The cardio intervals are just long enough to get your heart pumping without leaving you feeling like you will pass out or have an asthma attack.  The intervals using hand weights are short and sweet, getting right to the point for those who are bored with weights or just don't like them.  And you get a good workout for you abs as well.

I recommend using 2 to 3 lb hand weights for beginners.  Work your way up to 5 lb, 8 lb or higher.

  I gave my review 4 stars for two reasons.  There is no guidance on what weights to use for which exercises.  In my experience (granted it is not much!), I feel one could strain his or her back/shoulders using too heavy a weight.  Use your best judgement knowing your strengths and weaknesses.  Also, I dislike the cool down routine.  I feel it is too short and some of the moves put some strain on the knees.  If you agree, just do what I do.  I repeat the warm up at the end of the workout instead of doing the cool down.

 Overall, I recommend this workout for those who want to increase their physical fitness, build muscle tone, or just look and feel better.  Enjoy!!",1140998400,13,1664,4.273311897106109
2327130,4,B0009WFFPO,"I have lots of exercise DVDs and this is quickly becoming one of my favorites for two reasons:

1. It has aerobics and body sculpting. Aerobics alone can't provide upper body toning.

2. This workout has a great mix of styles - there's some kickboxing, some dance, some yoga, some sports training moves - but not too much of each. You don't have a chance to get bored and the different styles work the muscle groups a little differently, providing a great overall workout.

Additionally, they've done a great job of showing lower and higher intensity modifications so you can use this DVD for a long time.

Lastly, the instructor is great. As others mentioned, she's energetic without making me want to hit the ""mute"" button (I'm pretty picky in this department).",1140825600,4,763,4.757575757575758

The work out is very good and a lot of fun.  The instructor is upbeat, positive and very informative.  Even though I already work out with handheld weights, the upper body moves still made my arms a little sore for two days after I tried them out for the first time.

I have to agree that you don't feel ""the burn"" with the weights and not really sore either but you don't have to feel the burn to get muscle  :)  it's a great compliment to my routine.  I usually do this video, the 8 min video of whatever muscle I am doing that day, my 5-day ab video from ""The Firm"" and a 15 min stretch video rounding out my workout at about 60min.  On my ""off days"" I walk 3 miles.

It is not fast enough to make me break a sweat or make me lose my breath. I prefer DVD's that really get my heart pumping and make me moderately out of breath. This workout was equivalent to me taking lightly paced stroll for 30 minutes. Comfy, relaxing and not too challenging. Unfortunately I am not here to watch the scenery, I want to lose weight.

I did this DVD 2 times this week.  I was very disappointed.  First, you cannot break this video up into sections like other DVD's.  So if you only had the time to do aerobics you can't break this down and just select aerobics.  In this day and age and the way DVD's are made - I should be able to do that.  The aerobics is good but let me tell you the section with the weights is sad.  The 1 minute on the abs is pathetic.  The abs should be done altogether at the end to get a real burn and good workout on them that way they could focus on the weight section more.  They move too quickly through an exercise instead of staying with it and putting more repetition on the move.  I noticed in one of the circuits (weights) about 6 reps on a move and then it was over and onto another move (no burn!)  What I also want you to know is I have ONLY been exercising since the end of November - I am over 200 pounds - so you KNOW I am not a fitness queen.  But quite honestly, I have found better circuit videos - Karen Voight's Burn and Firm.  That would be something I would recommend to anyone who has only a few months into exercising.  The plus is you can pick and choose through this video unlike the Prevention 321.  I also want to mention I use to exercise regularly and though I was up at this high weight I never stopped walking (as a form of exercise)  about 20 minutes bursts 2x a day - so I wasn't completely sedentary.  Meaning: if you are just starting out you may need to work up to the Karen Voight's video and maybe Prevention's circuit is right for you but otherwise I would skip this DVD altogether.  You'll sweat but its not a sweat you'll feel good about.",1137110400,12,1815,4.033613445378151

RESULTS!! I noticed one person said she didn't feel the burn or could she pick and choose parts of the workout. Maybe my dvd is differant, because i do it all time. I just click butten on my remote, and i easily by pass the 2 and 1 min routines, and focus on just the 3 min cardio ones. I do this workout 5-6 days a week. this week, i have started going back and doing some of those now to. if I want to do a bit more of a particular segment, i just use my forward and reverse buttens(dvd's are so much better then vcr, ya can see where your going..lol) i love that by only doing the cardio parts, im done in 20 min and really built up a good sweat, I do this daily and have finally gotten up to speed with the leader, which has really been paying off, i feel the burn and getten the results. I fianlly this past week shrunk out of my ""elastic"" waist jeans, and able to buy a butten up pair. that was such a joy!! especially since i have always been fit and active with sports, but after last pregnancy and a major surgery short time after left me unable to move much, i thought i was doomed with this extra weight, im so glad i found this workout, cuz its working, and I highly recommend it to everyone!! ps, my kids love doing this with me on weekends, it helps them get that all important exercise thats fun in these long michigan winters that keep ya cooped up inside. will check back, cant wait to see who else loves this dvd and found it worked for them!!! take care all!",1136332800,10,1923,4.0498687664042
