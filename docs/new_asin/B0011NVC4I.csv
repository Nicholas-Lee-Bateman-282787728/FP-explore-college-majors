8241963,1,B0011NVC4I,I feel qualified to offer this criticism because I tutor the Reading and Writing sides of the SAT.  This video is mostly fluff.  It offers practically none of the specific strategies with which I helped students get well over two hundred points over their previous and untutored scores.  I suppose of a student knew nothing of the SAT that a few of the general comments might be of a little help.,1408147200,,396,4.549295774647887
