8214836,4,B000UUCSD2,"This was a fun watch.  It was almost more about Iceland than off-roading - but I guess that's more than half the fun of it.
Made me want to go to Iceland.
I would have liked to seen more on the truck and off-roading.",1388707200,,216,3.909090909090909
8214837,5,B000UUCSD2,"Excellent video.

A little outdated, but worth watching for sure.

It is great to see how many placed you can go with a nice truck & a pop-up truck camper.",1274054400,,155,4.133333333333334
8214838,5,B000UUCSD2,"I first found out about the Turtle expeditions with a Google search for reliability of the Chevy 454 v8 engine.  Should have heeded the warnings about Unreliability of this engine before buying an RV with this engine.  But the written accounts of the 4WD travels of this interesting couple sparked my appetite for more.  Had to own this video of travels in their modified Ford 4WD truck w/ camper in Iceland.  A unique view of travels off the beaten path (The Road Less Traveled).

My only wish is that these folks would publish a book about their world travels, much via 4WD on jeep trails.  Their travel logs, and other web research, have made me realize that serious off-hiway travel via 4WD is a science -- not simply buying a stock SUV (CUV?) and thinking that one can go anywhere offroad without any preparation or knowledge of driving techniques and necessary engineering to avoid getting stuck and/or stranded.

For those interested in taking the road less traveled, this video is priceless!",1264896000,,999,4.807017543859649
8214839,4,B000UUCSD2,"I enjoyed the Turtle Expeditions Iceland video. It shows some of the most impressive sights in Iceland (the footage of Gullfoss is particularly impressive). My only qualm with the video is the excessive amount of time spent discussing technical aspects of their vehicle (I didn't need to see the tire changes, etc.) that took screen time away from one of the most impressive places on earth. That is the sole reason that I gave the video four stars instead of the five it would have otherwise merited.
The tour is off the beaten path generally, and shows many of the interior sights that are tough to get to in Iceland due to the lack of roads and forbidding combination of lava, desert and glaciers. The strength of the video is in the unusual areas they choose to show, that most people will never see.
I love Iceland and highly recommend it as a vacation destination. If you can, by all means go on an interior tour, as nothing comes close to seeing it firsthand. If you can't go, then by all means, watch this video, as it takes you as close as you can get without actually renting a Super Jeep.",1062720000,4,1099,4.472636815920398
8214840,5,B000UUCSD2,"This amazing ride across Iceland thrills and educates. Follow along in an adventure with Gary and Monika Wescott in their Super Truck, the Turtle V. I was impressed with scenery, people, and production of this video. Thank you for allowing me to cross the land of fire and ice with Gary and Monika from home. I can't wait for more videos.",996192000,3,338,4.557377049180328
8214841,5,B000UUCSD2,"Journey through Iceland on a Turtle?  Yes, it is possible.  Not just any Turtle but a ultra-sophisticated vehicle modified and souped up to take on the diverse weather and terrain of Iceland.  A spactacularly photographed and produced journey of a land that is a contradiction in terms.  Witness rolling green hillsides, snowy plains, volcanic geyesers, all from the comfort of your home.  As close as you can get to the real thing without going there yourself.  Interesting stories, interesting locals, fantastic adventure.",985824000,6,524,5.329268292682927
