A kindergartener could have drawn Shaggy and Scooby-Doo better than the cartoonists did in this version. Save your money and purchase a ""real"" Scooby-Doo DVD.",1238889600,3,279,5.043478260869565
3411796,1,B00186DF4S,"My daughter loves Scooby and the gang, and when she saw this, she was horrified. This looks nothing like the Scooby gang that Hannah/Barberra created! Thankfully, she doesn't own this stuff. She figures if it isn't released by Warner Bros. or Hannah/Barberra, and if it doesn't have Casey Kasem in it, then it ISN'T the real Scooby! Get more of the real Scooby shows onto DVD, and not this crap! If I was allowed to, I'd give it a -1 star. That show should not have been created!",1230336000,5,479,4.454545454545454
3411797,3,B00186DF4S,"First off, let me just say that I would give this DVD 5 stars for the content, however, an incredibly lame anti-piracy introduction ruins it for me. The clip features Dorothy, Toto, and the gang as the EVIL DOWNLOADERS/COPIERS and the Wizard as the GOOD CORPORATE GUY!!! All it made me want to do was to find it on Pirate Bay... And for a DVD that's only supposed to be for sale in the US and Canada (Region 1), why is the second language (and subtitles) Portugese? Curiouser and curiouser...",1215993600,6,492,4.477777777777778

8268446,4,B00186DF4S,"I grew up with the original series, and my 3-year old son wore some Scooby-Doo DVDs out over a period of a few months.  We started watching the ""bonus"" episodes on these DVDs of this newer series ""Shaggy and Scooby-Doo Get a Clue!""  Just like the original series, this one uses a formulaic plot that is replicated each time.  My son loved them instantly, and I was skeptical.  They actually grow on you though.  Definitely not for the Scooby-Doo purist, which is probably why this was a short-ran series.",1349654400,,504,4.617977528089888

This review is more of the episodes contained in this Vol. This show continues to be great! After getting over your initial shock of this show, you will be laughing with this show and loving the characters! (Napoleon Dynamite spoof characters are my favorite!!) This disk is very nice with some great episodes with fun characters and a really good plot! Not you're average Scooby-Doo but still very good! If your still not convinced watch episodes for free on Kids WB!.com. They will not disappoint and have you coming back to Amazon to buy these disks!",1272067200,3,810,5.872881355932203
8268449,1,B00186DF4S,"The ""new"" versions of Scooby and Shaggy, that we see in this DVD stinks like limberger cheese after it's been sprayed by a skunk.

Who came up with the stupid ideas to:

1. Change these lovable characters when they were awesome just the way they were?

2.  Put two black dots on their faces and call them 'eyes'?

The animation stinks because it takes away the ""souls"" of Scooby and Shaggy.

It is often said: ""The eyes are the pathway to the soul"". I agree.

Sadly, these new versions of Scooby and Shaggy have no soul. These are Scooby and Shaggy imitators.

 For the past 40 years Scooby and the gang have essentially remained the same and are more popular than any cartoon characters in the history of cartoons. They are already ""hip and fresh"".

The Scooby and Shaggy in this series are nerds, and with their black dots for eyes, they look like they are on coke. They don't come close to capturing the true essense of the characters.

If it aint broke, don't fix it.",1270252800,4,971,4.429378531073446
