6305351,5,B00IYLWV72,"Love Luke Bryan's music but wanted to learn more about him.  He seems like such a nice guy and so down to earth.  The DVD confirms that.  It was nice to hear his story and how he became so famous.  Oh and Zac Brown, quit being a bully and keep your opinions to yourself.",1402790400,5,270,3.9444444444444446

6305354,1,B00IYLWV72,I love Luke but this isn't his.  Someone just made it up. I saw a tweet a while ago and someone asked Black Mike (if you know who that is) if this was real and he said no. Please don't waist your money on this.,1431907200,,210,3.6666666666666665

6305365,1,B00IYLWV72,If you watch when Luke is on TV being interviewed then you've already seen it. I would say it is a waste of money. It kind of looks like an amateur made it and now I'm wondering if Luke even approved it.,1413072000,10,203,3.857142857142857

6305368,1,B00IYLWV72,Don't buy this it's awful. I love Luke Bryan but I could've just youtubed all of this footage. The narrator is the worst. She's so boring. They showed a clip from Ellen that looked like it aired in the 80's. They didn't even play any of his music. Could've been in the background or something. I got this as a gift. Completely disappointed.,1411171200,11,340,4.412698412698413
