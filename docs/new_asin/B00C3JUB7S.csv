I had to dock a star because the subtitles are atrocious. They are presented in a huge yellow font that is too high up from the bottom of the screen. The show is presented in its original 4:3 aspect ratio and the subtitles serve to remind you of that as frequently as possible by flowing over into the black bars on the sides of the video. I prefer that they keep the show in 4:3 of course as you can generally forget about the blank spaces to the sides, but the ugly subs stick out like a sore thumb. I have some hope that this will get better as the releases go on. It's just an unfortunate blemish on an otherwise great if bare-bones release.",1492992000,4,784,4.130718954248366

8577133,5,B00C3JUB7S,"This is the first part of the famed show that brought giant robots, cops, and slice of life comedy together in a way that ends up being a real treat.  This collection sees the old show remastered in HD and released on bluray for the first time states side.  This one is a must for fans, for anime enthusiasts, and anyone interested in a fun robotics themed semi-hard scifi cop comedy.  It is an unusual brew, but a good one.  The dub is not one of the best, but it does grow on you if you stick with it, but otherwise you can watch the subs.",1383696000,5,541,4.0754716981132075
