7802319,2,4261404842,"This is a very strange a concert dvd. Barely a minute goes by without any sort of trippy animation or cartoon dancing across the screen. And yes I literally mean cartoon. I have no idea what drugs the director of this Rhythm Devils dvd are on, but I guess they want to make it mandatory for the viewer to partake in his trip!!!

The music here is interesting, and it's nice to see Mike Gordon playing during the Phish hiatus. These concerts were taped in 2006. I wish I could rate this higher, but the stupid animations just kill this movie. It's 1,000 times worse than the Grateful Dead View from the Vault animation sequences.

If you buy this just know that it is basically trippy  music videos and not a concert video. The packaging is the best part. Hard book style with about 10 pages of photos and the complete song lyrics.",1428796800,,830,4.411764705882353
7802320,4,4261404842,"New music by Billy and Mickey- the drumming duo known as the Rhythmn Devils. I wish they would have included one of their shows in its entirity (including their killer Grateful Dead covers & other cover songs) Their new music is groovy but I'm rating it '4' cos I can't rank it higher than my beloved Dead DVDs (Downhill From Here, Truckin In Buffalo, Grateful Dead Movie)",1409011200,,372,4.567164179104478
7802321,5,4261404842,"This DVD is so awesome that I just keep watching it over and over. I love it so much I ordered a 2nd one and gave it to a friend. Every song is enjoyable and the music really moves you. If the song ""YOUR HOUSE"" doesn't make you want to get up and dance then you're already DEAD! Pun intended! I recommend this DVD to anyone that enjoys music. It truly is an enjoyable experience with some nice animation and great music from top notch musicians.  Mickey Hart (percussion) & Bill Kreutzmann (drums) from the Grateful Dead, Mike Gordon (bass) from Phish, Steve Kimock (one of my favorite jam guitarists) Sikiru Adepoju (talking drum) and Jen Durkin (vocals) from Deep Banana Blackout. Check it out for yourself.

7802322,1,4261404842,"Whoever made this DVD must've been doing it for their 8th grade computer art class. Very juvenile production with horrible, I mean HORRIBLE visual effects. Great, you inverted the colors and put some stupid graphic over the band members so we can't see them play.

Nice packaging though.",1362700800,,287,4.979166666666667
7802323,5,4261404842,"The Rhythm Devils: Bill Kreutzman and Mickey Hart of Grateful Dead had a shortlived highly potent band going in '06. With psychedelic guitar maestro Steve Kimock (Zero and countless other projects, quite a legend, at least in jamband circles), Mike Gordon of Phish handling the bass, and actually I've never heard him sound better than in these surrondings. African drummaster Sikiru Adepoju and last but not least the formidable Jen Durkin (Deep banana Blackout) handling the vocals with power and Janis Joplin like sensuality.

A mixture of rockclassics like ""Piece Of My Heart"", Dead-songs like ""Fire On The Mountain"" and ""Loose Lucy"" and a slew of newly composed Mickey Hart songs set to lyrics - poignant as always - by Robert Hunter.

A world music feast for the ears and eyes, reminiscent of Santana or Zawinul Syndicate.

This show filmed in Chicago (10-24) is certainly essential - not only for dead heads.",1249171200,5,915,5.006578947368421
7802324,4,4261404842,"im not sure what to expect with post -GD incarnations, but after a slow start this dvd has some good songs..i give a positive review for jen durkin who does an amazing job on the song 7 seconds..and she is attractive with good energy too...mike gordon on bass does a good job too, but neither mike or steve kimock really stretch out too much..trippy graphics accompany the songs, but they're aren't too heavy and don't take away from the music..all songs but 1 or 2 are new robert hunter colaborations..the packaging is well done as well..check it out for yourself!",1215216000,2,565,4.66
