I got my hopes up when I read several reviews stating that the discs are pan-regional and will play everywhere.  Unfortunately, this is NOT the case (at least, not in my experience).  I tested them in 3 different DVD and/or Blu-ray players, and none of the discs worked in any of the 3 players.  Really disappointing.  I should have believed the initial product description after all.  I'll be returning theses discs to Amazon.  :(

If anyone finds this series available on US-region discs, please let me know!",1515715200,,673,4.928571428571429
8709960,5,B00VFZU9J6,"First off, this IS the series seen on American Heros Channel (formerly the Military Channel), so if that is what you are looking for (I was), you've found it.  It is 10 discs, and appears to be the entire series.

Second, the package is clearly marked ALL Region (and does not indicate NTSC/PAL or anything else).  So it should play no matter what/where you are.  That being said, my old Sony DVD player would not play the discs, but my 2010 MacPro had no problem, so I am guessing the problem is with my very old DVD player.  YMMV.

Very pleased to have found the series in one package.",1493769600,5,587,4.339449541284404
8709961,5,B00VFZU9J6,"This was exactly the product I expected; one of the best WWII documentaries around.  One added bonus that I discovered when the product arrived (a couple of weeks early by the way) is that the DVD set is Region FREE, not Region 2 as described.  t can be played on any DVD player.",1493337600,5,279,4.245283018867925
8709962,5,B00VFZU9J6,Excellent presentation.  One of the best I have ever seen.,1470096000,3,58,4.8
