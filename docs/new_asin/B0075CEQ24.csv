8510538,5,B0075CEQ24,"I participated in a performance of this operetta while an undergraduate, many years ago. I never expected to fine a performance on video, and was somewhat apprehensive. However, I discovered an amateur performance ranking with anything I might have hoped for. Certainly, Utopia does not rank with G and S gems such as The Gondoliers, which preceded it in the canon.. I have an audio recording, which I played before viewing the video. My evaluation of the piece is that after a rather perfunctory first act, the second act contains a few gems---especially the opening  tenor aria. .(Incidentally,, my group also performed the final G and S operetta; which was a disaster for all involved, cast, crew and audience. I strongly advise the performers in this group, to avoi any attempt to complete the canon.)",1502755200,,805,4.962962962962963
8510539,3,B0075CEQ24,"For a community, single camera production, this wasn't too bad.  It begs the question as to why a company like this would find it important to market a DVD of their performance, but there are other concerns.  The production is generally quite silly; ""slapstick"" is an understandment at times.  One can't help thinking of Monty Python, the resemblence is striking.  If you like that sort of treatment of G and S, this might be the production for you-  I am not a fan of anything that clouds the simple elegance of the music and Gilbert's brilliance.  To pause and wait for a laugh is to show that the original Gilbert is just not understood.  Gilbert doesn't need any help, let alone from mugging and silliness.  The staging is often confusing, I don't know if there are too many people in the cast, or it was simply confusing.  The huge set pieces were funny, for about a second, the space they took up was hardly worth the titter of laughter.  The music was well treated, the orchestra fought the score a bit, but this is quite difficult playing and most orchestra players have never done it before.  Some nice vocals from the leads singing  Princess Zara and the King, and several of the ""Flowers of Progress"" had very nice voices. The cast was a bit uneven and even the best singers would have trouble being heard over all the running around they must do.  The gem of the show is the second act's ""Society has quite forsaken."" One thing was done in a style that emulated most traditional G and S productions, anyway.",1374364800,2,1519,4.540441176470588
8510540,4,B0075CEQ24,"I have long been a fan of Utopia Limited, as I'm a fan of all Gilbert & Sullivan.  This particular play is unique in so many ways, and this production was quite interesting.  It is made to look like a comic book or a cartoon, with crazy stage sets and mostly good singing on the part of the principles.  It is not without problems.  The photographer was not very good, the sound was often muffled and difficult to hear, and a lot of the original dialog was considerably edited down, and the villains continue to fight another day.  But aside from these shortcomings, the cast was likable and appealing.  King Paramount, who in this version has five kids instead of the traditional three, and he's the star of the show, as was intended.  He a tallish, slightly paunchy man with a jolly, round little face and a big, booming laugh, and fancy tennis shoes - and he's a great Dad to his kids.  The really surprising bunch of characters were to so-called ""Flowers of Progress"" from England, who are full of fun, and full of ideas big enough to match the King's.  This is an imperfect production, but its plentiful positives far outweigh the negatives.  If you like Gilbert & Sullivan but have never seen this particular operetta, you won't be disappointed.",1373500800,3,1251,4.594594594594595
8510541,4,B0075CEQ24,"Any new recording of Utopia Limited is an excuse for cheering.  This story, woefully underrated, probably because of urban legend within G&S circles, is charming, fresh and funny, and in some ways more timely today than since its original showing in 1893.  This production may not be as slick and professional looking as some other versions, but it still has a lot of charm of its own, with a great hero, and is worth seeing.  Yes, there are some technical issues, but they are not insurmountable.",1369958400,2,497,4.755813953488372
8510542,4,B0075CEQ24,"This is a complete performance, very well done, and very enjoyable.  The story is  interesting, and deals with an Island country, and romance, power structures, and party politics.",1358985600,,180,5.392857142857143
8510543,1,B0075CEQ24,"Where to start?  Since the show wasn't miked, the voices were fuzzy.  There was only one camera, which didn't move through out the entire show.  No cuts, no close ups.  Also, they one showed the first half of the show.  The second act was nowhere to be seen.",1333670400,12,258,4.291666666666667
