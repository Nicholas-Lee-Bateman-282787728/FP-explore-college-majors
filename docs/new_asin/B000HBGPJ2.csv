Much speculation is based on ""Higher Criticism"" found in the JEPD theory as well as a Quella document.  It reduces the Bible to a bunch of peace-meal speculative stories and fables.  For the novice theologian it really need the balance of ""Textual Criticism""  I used it for a Bible class as and example of our haywire modern Biblical scholarship.  The Christian faith is based on faith, and there appears to be little faith that God would preserve His Word for us today.",1490400000,,604,4.537037037037037

Definitely recommend it",1239321600,,127,4.565217391304348
8137952,5,B000HBGPJ2,"I thought this was a wonderful documentary on who wrote the bible.  As some of the other reviewers state, this was done unbiased.  They present information for and against any hypothesis they present.  It should give one a clearer idea of where this wonderful book came from.",1198972800,,275,4.808510638297872
8137953,5,B000HBGPJ2,"I find this product fascinating. Compared to most of these types of programs on A&E and History Channel, this one was free from the usual liberal bias. It was fairly presented with guests ranging from the late Jerry Falwell to John Dominic Crossan (the Jesus Seminar fame). It is a comprehensive investigation into the authorship of the Bible. It presents a simplified and clearly explained view of the Documentary theory of the Pentateuch. It is not a propaganda on either the right or the left. It is vey informative and balanced.",1198800000,2,532,4.857142857142857
8137954,4,B000HBGPJ2,"After watching the videos I still don't have a clear understanding who wrote the bible. However, the video did make a very good point at the end. It is not important who wrote the bible, but know and understand what the bible offers. If the bible can make a difference in your life, the bible did what Jesus has been telling us for centuries.",1166572800,2,342,4.359375
