633079,3,630338630X,"Indian Paint is almost unique among Westerns in that it is wholly populated by Native American characters -although most are played by white actors. The movie contains only Native Americans and there are no references anywhere to white leaving me to speculate it may be set at a time before the opening up of the West .

Native American life in this picture does have a timeless quality and feel -as if the rituals and observances we see have been going on for generations and will survive into the future .There is a strong reverence for tradition in the feel of the picture which is in essence a ""rites of passage "" tale .Nichko (Johnny Crawford )is the son of the chief (Jay Silverheels)and the movie is about his growth to manhood ,partly through rituals such as the Sundance ceremony(much less graphic here than when shown in A Man Called Horse )but mostly through the learning of responsibility and the importance of sacrifice and the community values of the tribe .

The bulk of the story deals with Nichko'd taming of a colt who he marks out from childhood as his own ;there are battles with nearby tribes and the usual slew of perils in such movies including wild animals (coyotes and mountain lions )and natural hazards like fire .

It is good to look at with some fine location photography but the storyline is a bit thin and only Silverheels give more than an adequate performance

Its still a good movie with its overtones of other horse themed pictures like Seabiscuit or National Velvet ;a minor pleasure but nonetheless still a pleasure",1114560000,16,1552,4.673992673992674

633503,4,630338630X,"A unique movie like no other.  Filmed on location.  What makes this movie so ""watchable""  is that it was produced at a time when movies of the ""western genre"" were almost always about the Cowboys and Cavalry against the Indians when Indians were in the screenplay. On the other hand this movie is just about the Indians.  The approach to casting is interesting too with so many Caucasians aspiring to be Indians.  For a movie of its time period, the storyline is more than adequate.",1453507200,3,482,4.623529411764705

633505,5,630338630X,"This movie is dated, uses mostly white actors in face and body paint, and the characterizations are sketchy and sometimes odd.  THAT SAID, it's absorbing to watch- really a complete pleasure- because the horses are exquisite, the young men who ride them are so light and skillful, and there are NO cowboys or cavalry.  It's an entirely 'native' story, with a minimum of violence (one skirmish with a neighboring tribe).",1452816000,4,419,4.9714285714285715

I liked Silverheels as Tonto in the Lone Ranger, and Crawford at the Rifleman's son, but as soon as the credits began to roll it appeared to be a movie put together by the Crawford family. Robert Crawford Senior as an Associate Producer, and Film Editor, Robert Crawford Junior as one of the actors, and of course Johnny Crawford, and Jay Silverheels as the main characters.  From Senior to Sons, I wondered if it would be any good. I couldn't get more than a few minutes into it when the acting and story line got boring.  It was like they were reading from a script.

633574,4,630338630X,"Actually I liked this movie but in terms of ""great western movies"" I would only rate it 4 stars. It does have a lot of action and intensity at times but does not quite come up to the standards of other westerns of that time period (1960s) such as John Wayne and Randolph Scott movies, etc for example. The film does feature a story-line told from the Native American Indian point of view, however, not all actual Native Americans were used in every role in the film. For example, Johnny Crawford, a non-native American (from TVs RIFLEMAN) plays a lead Native American character in the film and had to go through heavy make-up changes daily in order to make his skin darker. However Crawford's character's father, a strong Chief leader, provider and warrior for his tribe, is portrayed by Jay Silverheels, a full-blood Mohawk Indian and well known to the ""baby-boomer generation"" as TONTO, from the TV series, ""THE LONE RANGER. As a member of that generation myself, I enjoyed seeing two of my favorite western actors in roles other than they portrayed on their TV shows plus the movies was made in my native state around the Brazos River area in Central Texas.",1440374400,5,1160,4.6911764705882355

633670,3,630338630X,"It's okay, but I couldn't get that into it (and yes, I watched it all the way through while sitting at my ""office"" desk).

The main reason I watched it was because brothers Johnny Crawford (from Rifleman) and Robert Crawford (from Laramie) were both in this film.

The movie could not steal my attention away from the computer long enough for me to be able to tell you the plot, other than bits and pieces. That is one of my criteria for giving a 4 or 5 rating. If I don't stop watching the movie in the middle, I usually give it at least a 3, though sometimes only a 1 or 2, depending on why I didn't bother clicking STOP.

I'm not going to try to predict what kind of viewers would like this film, except to say that if you're a woman (or someone) who loves seeing young male adults not wearing shirts, and often wearing not much more than whatever they call those waist outfits), then you'll love the film.

But if you prefer an engaging plot that steals your interest away from whatever else you're doing, then you might want to look for other movies.",1406073600,2,1055,4.28643216080402
633734,2,630338630X,"I watched this movie mainly out of curiosity to see Johnny Crawford in something other than his most famous role as the Rifleman's son, Mark. (Crawford plays the lead in the movie, not Jay Silverheels, so I don't know why the listing mentions only Silverheels.)  Although I wouldn't say the movie was terrible, Crawford's acting ability (and that of some of the other actors) was subpar.  Crawford was OK in a supporting role on the Rifleman, but at this young age did not have the chops to pull off a leading role very well.  The cheap black wigs and brown make-up they put all over the actors to try to make them look like native Americans didn't help either--it was definitely NOT done by any of Hollywood's better make-up artists.",1398038400,,734,4.630769230769231
633735,3,630338630X,"Both these movies are part of the ""Rare Cult Cinema"" DVD series of 12 films offered by Amazon for $9.43 as of 2/22/2014, compared with $45.00 for the cheapest used copy of the duo.  Not a tough decision if you want these two.

""Indian Paint"" is a corny flick from the 1960's that is likely a waste of time unless you love looking at the appealing physiques of Johnny Crawford and Jay Silverheels, in which case this is a fine movie.  ""African Safari"" by contrast is a terrific sleeper: an often riveting documentary of an incredibly skilled and fearless adventurer whose encounters with wild animals, African natives, glaciers, and deadly volcanoes is well worth the cost of the entire (otherwise usually dismal) set.  One scene alone in this movie -- the charge of a wounded lion at the hunter-filmmaker -- will stop your heart and stay in your memory for a very long time to come.  Ron Shanin walked the walk.

The larger cheaper collection has another advantage of having a couple watchable entries like ""Road to Nashville,"" a showcase for leading country-western stars of the 60's, some legendary, and ""Santee"" starring Glenn Ford as a bounty hunter avenging the death of his young son by gun slinging outlaws.",1393027200,2,1214,4.784688995215311

633737,5,630338630X,I would recommend this movie for all to see. This gives many lessons that are in good taste as it keeps a wholesome perspective and the reference to the Great Spirit (Yahweh) and his part in the learning process. In today's world we could use more of that. Johnny Crawford does a great acting job in this most of us remember him in the rifleman. This may be classified as a western but it is not your typical western. I am not that much into westerns but this one is a must see.,1387843200,2,478,4.150537634408602
