8326008,4,B001252DC0,I managed to get this elsewhere really cheap but I would deffinately have paid the Amazon price for it also. this is a boxed set that includes ALL of Larry Boy's greatest.  My son LOVES this set and watched at least one of the DVDs a day. This helps me by having a choice for him to watch than just watching the same one over and over. This has a DVD with the short cartoons on it also and that is his favorite. The only complaint I have is that it does not just play through all the shows on that DVD at once. You have to put the remote on each one and select play and do that each time one is over. Thats why only 4 stars. Our DVD player does not let us select from the machine itself and the remote to it was so small that it has been missing for a long while. SO we have no way to see ALL the short cartoons on the DVD.  Hopefully we will find that remote someday. LOL.,1228608000,2,873,3.8444444444444446
