7431161,1,B0158XOLI0,"History this isn't, and if you're buying it for anything other than edification or to support the K of C, it's not worth your time. The only real authority cited here in Miguel Leon Portilla who kind of sort of said on the basis of nothing at all that Juan Diego really existed. And then we get the Bishop of Phildelphia (what does he know) telling us how moved he was by the story, and all the rest. If you're really interested in a serious treatment of this supposed apparition, you're going to have to read Stafford Poole's excellent book on the subject. Or go back and read Joaquin Icazbalceta published in the 19th century. Actually, this is terrible, but charity compels me to say it's watchable for a few minutes.",1448064000,3,720,4.5038167938931295
7431162,5,B0158XOLI0,Excellent quality and value. You will be amazed by the science behind the image. It is a true miracle within a miracle.,1447804800,2,119,4.454545454545454

I'M so happy that all these movies are been done, not like hollywood CRAP! (sick & tired of so many stupid & meaningless movies)!!! (I don't waste my time watching hollywwod crap anyway!). You won't regret it.

7431166,5,B0158XOLI0,"I saw this on ABC and want to watch it again. It was like a refreshing of my faith in the Blessed Virgin. I did not feel that it was espousing Catholicism for all, rather that we can all pray to her in times of need and she will hear us and pass our request on to her Son. It also explained in an understandable way that there is no way that this cloth could be a fake or reproduced by human means. I highly recommend it to all Catholics, and to those wanting to know more about how they can ask Mary to protect them under her mantle.",1444694400,60,534,3.908256880733945
7431167,1,B0158XOLI0,"Imagine my excitement when I heard about this documentary.  OL of Guadalupe!  Her Tilma rivals the Holy Shroud in scientific amazements.  And narrated by Jim Caviezel?  This should be outstanding, right?
Wrong.  The trailer illustrates the agenda:  one world religion propaganda, using the Holy Mother of our Savior as bait.",1444694400,2,324,5.38

7431185,4,B0158XOLI0,"The first 20-30 minutes reenacts the miracle itself but, it really is poorly done.  Get past that and it does become very interesting.  I spent my first eight years in a Catholic school, named Our Lady of Guadalupe to be exact and was never instructed with this kind of information and background; not even the real miracle being the uniting of the Indians to the universal Catholic church.  We were only told of the ""vision"" and it was left at that.  The Guadalupanas were always a mystery to me and the kids in school.  We thought it was a group of widows who took care of the altar flowers and cooked for fund raising bazaars! What a wealth of information; even though I am no longer a Catholic.  I did buy copies for a friend of mine who is a nun and for my sister and her husband who consider themselves devout in the religion.  Too bad about that first 20-30 minutes.....",1477008000,2,877,4.3765432098765435

7431204,3,B0158XOLI0,"This is good as far as it goes, but it leaves out a lot of the story.  For example, it says not a word about the fact that the flowers on Our Lady's robe are identical to those in the area.  It also says nothing about the arrangement of stars on her robe, which show the constellations visible to the Aztecs.",1456617600,2,308,4.032786885245901
7431205,5,B0158XOLI0,"I love this documentary. It brought tears to my eyes at times. It does not push the Catholic Church on people, as one reviewer suggested. It just tells the truth, and all is  fact. The image on the Tilma is still intact and exactly like it was when Juan Diego showed it for the first time, except for a little damage on the right side when a worker spilled some acid on it. It has been through many scientific tests,  and is proven real and authentic!!",1456358400,4,452,4.244186046511628

7431207,3,B0158XOLI0,"This film was difficult to watch even in English because of all the subtitles when Mexican priests or the Bishop was speaking. Jim Caviezel narrates only a portion of it and the rest if filled up with choppy interviews. Unfortunately, my kids won't enjoy it for this reason of having to read subtitles quickly. The film (documentary) also uses some cheesy dramatizations. It shows Juan Diego picking roses the Blessed Virgin told him to pick. The roses are dramatically colorful (in a fake kind of way) and nothing is said about the true indigenous roses that would not have been in bloom at that time, but miraculously were.  I was also disappointed the film didn't address the science behind the tilma: It touches briefly on the fiber content, colorization of the image itself but could have said so much more that would have been fascinating. A scientist explains the advanced techniques that were used when images of people were discovered reflected in the Blessed Virgin's eyes, but then doesn't go on to tell us more about this amazing miracle and possibly who these people are!",1456012800,4,1084,4.859459459459459
7431208,5,B0158XOLI0,"As in-depth a story of Our Lady's apparitions and simple message of how She works to bring Her Son to her children's hearts as can be told.

I like the different aspects covered in this video in a short amount of time (1 hour). I also used it for two youth group sessions, and it gave us a lot of different topics to discuss. I love how it embraces Mexican culture and the culture of the Church -- some interviewees speak English and some speak Spanish (subtitles are used) and viewers hear from a variety of different experts.",1454976000,4,518,4.40625

7431223,5,B0158XOLI0,"An excellent video of the miracle and the continuing message.  I love Our Lady of Guadalupe, and her story is one of the most fascinating in Christendom.  The largest mass conversion in Christian history.  Though estimates of the number of conversions vary widely, the least I've heard is 7,000,000 Aztecs who turned from their pagan snake god worship and beliefs and became Catholic.  If you missed this on EWTN when it was recently shown, it's certainly worth the money to purchase it.  Share it with your skeptical friends.  It's a real eye opener.",1453248000,8,551,4.870967741935484
7431224,1,B0158XOLI0,I returned it because it was nothing original. Much of it you could view on YouTube since it was pieced together from previous videos.,1452816000,2,134,4.625
7431225,5,B0158XOLI0,"I love the story and all the details. It's not a ""movie,"" as I thought, but more of a documentary.

7431233,5,B0158XOLI0,"This beautifully produced hour-long video lovingly tells the story of Our Lady of Guadalupe and Saint Juan Diego, beginning with the history of first-contact Mexico and proceeding to modern times, examining the spread of the devotion around the world. I had originally seen this video on EWTN and was impressed with the production values. The images and music are very nice and the capsule history lesson is excellent. The historical presentation was even-handed and accurate, and I was encouraged to hear the narration present the historical fact that the Spanish conquistadors had vital assistance from neighboring tribes when vanquishing the ruling Aztecs. This is a key truth that often gets lost in the various modern historical and political interpretations of the events.

The video also includes details regarding the apparition and Our Ladys words to St. Juan Diego, a description of the image on the tilma and how it functions as an meso-American codex, and numerous interviews with devotees of Our Lady of Guadalupe from around the world, including Archbishop Chaput of Philadelphia, one of the most brilliant churchmen of our era. If you find the apparition and the mysterious image fascinating as I do, I would encourage you to purchase this video. You won't be disappointed.",1450051200,8,1288,5.222222222222222

7431236,5,B0158XOLI0,"More information about Our Lady's tilma than I had ever found before! This documentary sets up the timeline/history before Our Lady appeared to Juan Diego, making this historical event seem even closer to us. Did you know that 2 other tilmas were commissioned and painted to be put at side altars and both had their fibers break down in a short period of time, as Our Lady's tilma continues to stay intact? SO much information on this DVD. Extremely well done. Very happy I made this purchase. Btw, when they discuss the images in Our Lady's eyes (reflected images of the persons who were standing there when Juan Diego dropped those roses out of the tilma), those images are Purkinje images. As a matter of fact, I had never even heard of Our lady of Guadalupe until we were discussing Purkinje images in medical school. I'm a cradle-Catholic, but post-Vatican II, and had never heard this story before!",1448755200,27,904,4.727848101265823
