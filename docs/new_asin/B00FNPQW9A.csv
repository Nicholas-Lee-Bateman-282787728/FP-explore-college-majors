8617212,5,B00FNPQW9A,"Lincoln@Gettysburg is not a long Program, but it is packed with interesting information -- some of which was new to me.  If you watch Lincoln@Gettysburg, expect to learn more about Mr. Lincoln's life and family, the importance of the telegraph as the new technology at that time, and the Civil War.  I have long been an admirer of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, and the presentation featured in this program lends even more dignity to that simple, yet profound, speech.",1414886400,,468,4.987179487179487

8617214,4,B00FNPQW9A,This is a very good short story of Gettysburg and how the Telegraph was used by Lincoln to direct the war. Some information is not covered well but the story is very good and says a lot for the time and the importance of his Gettysburg address to the future of the country.,1398297600,2,273,4.169811320754717
8617215,5,B00FNPQW9A,"This is an engrossing 60 minute film about Abraham Lincoln. It has English subtitles - always a plus. There are period photos and the talking heads that accompany educational films are kept to a minimum, many times giving their information as photographs are shown rather than just having the viewer watch someone sitting looking at the camera.

The film does not necessarily deal only with what a viewer might expect...the Gettysburg address. Instead it has an emphasis on Lincoln's use of the new communication device - the telegraph. This shows how he controlled and was able to oversee his armies in the field in what could be called the first presidential situation room.

Colin Powell is one of the chroniclers. He speaks regarding being a commander of fighting forces.
We are shown the time leading up to Gettysburg and a well done portrayal of the horrors of the aftermath of the battle...the bodies and the wounded. The film does an excellent job of depicting this and the sadness in a poignant segment of burying the dead and the establishment of the cemetery at which Lincoln spoke during its dedication.
There is an excellent analysis of Lincoln and the writing of his speech, an examination of it and what it truly says. The film ends with the power of the speech in today's world.

This is one of the better educational films I have seen. It would hold the attention of anyone interested in history, the Civil War or Abraham Lincoln.",1391644800,4,1447,4.78
