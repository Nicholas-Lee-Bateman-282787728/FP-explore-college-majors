4987744,5,B006GTG8M8,Shawn & Joanna Trautman's Waltz 101 dance lesson video is perfect for beginners and also for anyone who just wants a review of these dance steps. I especially like the way these instructors actually show you and your partner in close-up view exactly where to position your feet and hands during each step of the waltz. I realized while taking this lesson how important these tips are for the overall gracefulness that you see when you watch people do this dance. The way this waltz lesson is presented makes you feel very confident during the learning process. I truly appreciate this encouragement as a beginner!,1325980800,3,613,4.847619047619047

8497800,5,B006GTG8M8,"This is not our first Trautman video.  We taught ourselves the two-step using one of their videos. Just like the first DVD we used, this one is very well done--easy to follow and broken down into parts so you can soak in a little at a time. We are beginners with very little time on our hands. We are an older couple with no dance experience whatsoever. Shawn's system of instruction really works for us. We went out dancing the other night and I noticed we seemed to know a lot more turns and fancy looking steps than most people out there because the DVD teaches a lot of stuff that looks very fancy on the dance floor but isn't really all that difficult.  Using the DVD is a very good way to learn but we have found that it is important to practice on a regular basis. It doesn't require a ton of time but you have to be consistent. We try to practice about once a week. An hour is about the right amount of time for us. If we miss too many practice sessions we start forgetting what we learned. We don't try to learn everything at once either.  We take on just one step at a time and the video is set up perfectly to do it that way.  For us it takes practice over a period of time before it becomes second nature. Once it sinks in, it's a blast. We are totally comfortable dancing in public now and it's a very pleasant way to get in some moderate exercise and to spent some special time together. Thank you Shawn and your beautiful wife Joanna for making these videos so fun and so easy to follow for those of us with two left feet! We definitely will be buying more of your videos.",1452124800,2,1587,4.142857142857143

8497804,5,B006GTG8M8,One of the first Dance videos I have bought from Shawn Trautman. The video is easy to understand and follow along. He has a way of presenting dance instruction that puts a person at ease. Shawn and his wife seemed to love dancing and doing dance instruction. I am impressed and I am learning the Waltz. Another great thing about Shawn is I emailed him about a question on foot work with the waltz. He answered my email right a way. Of course I didn't explain it well and it took a few more emails to explain my self better. Mr. Trautman treated me with great respect and tried the move with his wife on a Friday evening at his dinner time. That is first class professionalism and the guy really cares about his customers. I would recommend anyone wanting to learn any type of dance to give Shawn's dance videos a try. You won't be sorry..,1361664000,,838,4.343949044585988
8497805,5,B006GTG8M8,I am a beginner. Bought this DVD recently after checking the reviews of many dance instruction DVDs. I found it to be very thorough and well structured so that I could learn at my own pace without rushing. Very well made.,1341187200,,221,4.414634146341464
8497806,5,B006GTG8M8,This DVD gave me sound basics and enough confidence to  get on the dance floor at a social event. It covers all aspects from posture to connection and leading in an easy to follow step by step fashion. A great way to get started.,1338768000,,229,4.204545454545454
8497807,5,B006GTG8M8,"Fun and Friendly! Perfect for all the right reasons! Whether you only have a few minutes a day to learn and polish for a specific event, or you want to invest significant time to build a great base for regular, ongoing dance sessions...Waltz 101 is PERFECT. No matter what your style or reason, Waltz 101 is perfect for Country or Ballroom, formal social events, ""date nights"" out, or intimate evenings at home....  Waltz 101 gradually builds you up AT YOUR PACE from the basics to many of the finer points of posture, position, timing, leading, following, etc., without overwhelming...  I can not recommend this disk enough! I also highly recommend the 2 hour Dance 101 DVD, which shows the basics and beyond of 8 popular dances....learn these and you've got the basics to do it all!

8497808,5,B006GTG8M8,"Yea! Thanks to the Trautmans we can now add another dance step to our growing collection as we climb up the beginning dancers' learning curve.  Waltz 101 is our fifth Trautman Dvd and it is every bit as good as the other four we've used.

I especially like the organization of instruction(intro/rhythm-timing/connection-style/lead-follow/review)that they have employed across all their 101 Dvd's. It makes for a very clear and easy progression to learn the dance step, and it has proven very useful for easy returns to specific sections of the dvd for repeated study.

Their combined instructional comments are extremely helpful for both partners and are well balanced for both the leader and follower.  I enjoy the tasteful decor of their dance studio, the excellent video quality, the nice balance of music audio with their voice instruction, and the excellent camera tracking of their moves with respect to what is being taught at the moment.  View it on a large screen tv and you will almost feel like you are right there with them.

The only criticism I can offer is that the Waltz 101 Dvd may not seem as much ""fun"" as their Swing 101 Dvd that we are concurrently studying.  But, I think that just comes with the differences in the rhythms and tempos of the two dances.  In contrast, if you are more in the mood to learn how to flow gracefully and elegantly to a dreamy, romantic waltz, rather than to learn the fast footwork and turns of the Swing - then the Trautman's Waltz 101 Dvd will definitely fill the bill.  They do their typical great job of teaching all the basics ""plus"" some extra challenges to get beginners confidently out on the dance floor to have both a ""fun and romantic"" time dancing.",1327881600,2,1710,4.730639730639731
