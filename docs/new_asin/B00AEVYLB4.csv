8550683,1,B00AEVYLB4,This 3D DVD requires the red & blue glasses. The 3D effects are poor. If you watch in 2D I'll give it 2 stars.,1454112000,2,110,3.625

8550689,3,B00AEVYLB4,"I was hoping ""America's Best Aquariums"" would be a virtual fish tank but it's more a documentary of five American aquariums, just as the name implies. There is, however, accessible in the disc's menu, a 40 minute SPECIAL FEATURE segment with a pleasant acoustic new-agey soundtrack -- if you're looking specifically for a fish tank on your TV. Unfortunately this clip is not loopable and at the end reverts back to the main menu.

The other five segments feature the amiable but corny narration of Wayne and Lynne as they guide us around the five aquariums. The underwater scenes, unfortunately, are interspersed with behind-the-scenes footage, interviews, historical factoids, etc. so muting the sound and turning off Wayne and Lynne's patter still does not create the 3D fish tank I was hoping for. To be fair, the 3D is superb and kids will probably love this title.

The disc plays OK in 2D on non-3D Blu-ray players.",1417651200,4,921,4.897435897435898
8550690,5,B00AEVYLB4,"My 7 year old grandson loved the different aquariums with all the aquatic animals, it was like having a private tour guide telling us what each one was and looking at them in 3-d was a big plus, thanks.",1364601600,5,202,4.205128205128205
