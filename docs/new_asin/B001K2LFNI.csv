3663002,3,B001K2LFNI,"Although I enjoyed the film's storyline(or re-hashed story line?)I found
some of the casting decision a bit, no, very insulting. Rachele Brooke
Smith may be a good actress on the rise(I hope)but has zero ballet body
requisites: her feet barely arch while on toe shoes, her knees don't straightem and lacks a decent natural line doing arabesques. The blond
actress playing her rival (good performance!)doesn't have the long legged
perfect body for ballet that we see on stages today(even in the chorus, or
corp de ballet members)My question is: Could they not find perfect or close to perfect real ballet dancers(or even advanced students)to play
those parts?. Don't they realize that a lot of the viewers of the film may
have some basic ballet knowledge?. As for the hip hop dance sequences I've
seen better in the local tv channels amateur competitions. Is that why
the scenes in the club were so poorly lighted?.",1240876800,9,914,4.941558441558442
3663003,5,B001K2LFNI,I loved this movie! I know part of it (her ballet training) may not be completely realistic but the movie is so good. It's different in a good way from the first Center Stage.,1240444800,,175,4.176470588235294
3663004,3,B001K2LFNI,"My favorite guilty pleasure movie obsession is dance films.  I will watch pretty much any lousy movie featuring dancing in its main plot, no matter what kind of dancing it is.  These movies all tend to be unimaginative and formulaic, but sometimes they manage to surprise you with decent acting performances and AMAZING dance performances.  One of these surprisingly good flicks is the original ""Center Stage"" -- so when I heard that there was a direct to DVD sequel, I knew I had to rent it.

The plot of this movie is very different from the first one, which is a breath of fresh air.  As fans of the first flick know, Jodi Sawyer made it into the American Ballet Academy by the skin of her teeth, then ultimately proved that by mixing passion and modern dance steps in with ballet, she had what it took to be a star in arrogant ""ballerino"" Cooper Nielson's new company.  This time around, Cooper can't save the star, because his company has run out of funding, putting him right back at ABA as an instructor.  And the girl we follow this time is, like Jodi was, a dancer who lacks technical skill but has lots of passion.  This time, however, she doesn't make it.  Perhaps that's because she auditions directly for (even more arrogant) company director Jonathan Reeves, instead of his representatives.  That's a great scene, because it allows us to see the cold, stark reality of hiring dancers, and keeping a company alive.

This movie is filled with good dance scenes and decent acting, as it melds ""street"" dancing with ballet, and shows us Kate's journey after her devastating rejection.  The director wanted to make the film seem less formal than the first one, so he uses a lot of hand-held camera moves that make the frames off-center, or shows us the dancers in reflection as they perform.  Call me old-fashioned, but I prefer that the camera be left alone during dance movies, so that I can follow the performance in full.

Speaking of performances -- that is where this movie really falls short compared to the last one.  Despite the fact that its only major improvement over the last one is that they hired a full cast of dancers (meaning that unlike the first movie, there's never a need to cut away from an actor who clearly cannot do his or her own dancing) this movie has no GREAT dance performances.  Just good ones.  The finale is especially disappointing compared to finale of the original.  That was a ten-minute, all out, full-on dance spectacular, with great pop music, great costumes, a great story -- and even greater dance moves.  This one is just . . . okay.  Nothing special.  It seems like such a sad waste of such an obviously talented cast.  Perhaps part of the reason is that, according to one of the extras, they only had four days to learn ALL the choreography for the entire movie.  That elevates the dancing in this sequel from good to impressive, but it's still disappointing that they couldn't get enough rehearsal time to really live up to the original.

The extras consist of two making-of featurettes, and an ungodly amount of trailers.  Seriously, I have *NEVER* seen so many trailers included in one movie before.  It's absurd.  Overall, this DVD is worth a rental, and is a must-see for fans of the original, if only because you get to watch Cooper Nielson dance hip-hop!  But I wouldn't recommend that anyone purchase it, because it just isn't the kind of movie you can watch over and over again, noticing new things about the dance performances every time.  Instead, go ahead and pop in the first one.  THAT one never gets old.",1238198400,20,3574,4.6449044585987265
3663005,5,B001K2LFNI,Bought this for my neice and she was thrilled!  Great follow-up to the first movie.,1235779200,,83,4.533333333333333
3663006,5,B001K2LFNI,"I was a huge fan of Kenny's when I watched the TV show on MTV ""Dancelife"". He is an excellent dancer and when I saw him on TV in a movie I had to stop and see what it was about. When I realized it was a sequel to the movie ""Center Stage"" I was excited, but not hopeful for a good movie, because I had seen his talent and had loved the previous movie. However, I was completely surprised by the quality of the pot and the great choreography and the dancers. I loved this movie for the excellent dancing, not to mention the acting was better then that of the first movie. I felt that Tommy's character was intriguing and talented, also believable in his struggle. I also liked the idea of a ballerina without rich parents, Kate, is inspiring and although you want to slap her into giving more of herself to her dream, she is totally relatable. Everyone has had self doubt and in that you relate to Kate in her goals and dreams. This movie is worth a watch if you enjoy movies about dance, there are some great ballet scenes as well as excellent hip hop routines. I am going to buy this movie as soon as it is available. Two Thumbs Up.",1230595200,9,1132,4.17351598173516
3663007,5,B001K2LFNI,"I enjoy dance movies and have the first ""Center Stage"" on dvd. I wasn't sure what to expect from the sequel but decided to check it out when it premiered in Oxygen channel. I found myself hooked within the first 10 minutes. Kenny Wormald and Rachele Brooke Smith are attractive and talented young actors who do a great job of carrying this movie. Both actors are clearly cast for their dancing and athletic abilities, as well as their good looks, and for novice actors, they do a creditable job.

The story centers around Kate Parker (Smith) and Tommy Anderson (Wormald). Kate dreams of attending the American Ballet School in NYC but unfortunately doesn't make the cut at audition. Tommy - a former hockey player turned ballet dancer - gets in. When Tommy spots Kate at the audition, sparks fly. Dejected Kate takes a job at a bar/dance club that is owned by Tommy's friend and Tommy falls for Kate.  Tommy offers to help Kate improve her ballet skills, while Kate helps Tommy improve his ""hip/hop-street dance"" skills. They hit it off and fall in love. Conflicts arise when Tommy's wealthy classmate Suzanne (Sarah Jensen) gets in the way and Kate is torn between her fear of rejection (as she plans to re-audition for ABS) and her dreams of being a ballerina.

If you love dance movies like ""Center Stage,"" ""Step Up"" and ""Save the Last Dance,"" then this movie is for you. The dancing is more of a blend of the first ""Center Stage"" and ""Step Up"" with ballet moves mixed in with hip-hop/street dance. Both leads are very talented and live up to the demands of the complex dance routines. Smith started out as a gymnast and it shows.  She is also charming and lights up the screen with her big smile and gorgeous eyes. Wormald was a back-up dancer for Justin Timberlake and was in the reality series ""Dancelife."" With his brown eyes and intense stare, he is definitely swoon-worthy.

Back from the first ""Center Stage"" are Peter Gallagher (in the same role) and Ethan Stieffel (Cooper Nelson - now an instructor), but don't expect Amanda Schull and Sasha Radensky from the first film. In all honesty, the new leads are interesting enough to hold the story so I spent little time regretting their absence.  The music blends well with the storyline and the dancing is superb.

If you're going in expecting to see a good made-for-tv movie with great dancing, attractive and talented leads and an engaging storyline, then you won't be disappointed.  Think of it as ""Center Stage"" meets ""Step Up"" with a bit of ""Flashdance"" sprinkled in and you're all set. For my part, I enjoyed it and certainly plan to purchase the dvd when it comes out. And if they ever do release the soundtrack, then I'll be in line to buy that, too.",1228176000,29,2718,4.647916666666666

3663059,5,B001K2LFNI,"The main character trains herself to be a professional ballerina.  She is struggling to find her place on a main stage primarily due to her near poverty background in Detroit, and her inability to have afforded herself professional pre requisites, and training, and ultimately a dance resume and portfolio.  She clearly has something, an edge, compared to even the most highly, classically trained dancers.  She has to find work using her skills, and eventually meets a boy dancer who is very gifted and wants her to succeed.  There are some problems with communication and turn down after turn down leaves the main character ready to quit.  Wether she succeeds or not is up to her, and an additional challenge, a twist for the plot;  the main character is determined to be a successful role model for her younger sister, proving that anything is possible with hard work and determination, but you have to believe in yourself.

The acting in this type of movie is usually extremely difficult to cast.  The cast in this movie was great.  Even the romance scenes were acceptable.  There was very little cheese in this movie which is suprising for it's genre.  The other good highlight is that the ballet dancing is nice to see, it is impressive to me, a person not educated in dance.  I at one point in the beginning thought this movie was going to be very boring and a repeat...it wasn't though, and what made me hold on and keep watching was the main character's charisma.  The girl NEVER stopped smiling.  And she was absolutley beautiful throughout the whole movie, and the character strength they gave her was inspiring.  She has an absolutely, gorgeous, breathtaking smile with perfect white teeth, and she moves very very well.  Her casting and performance caused me to give the fifth star.  Her costar worked well with her too.  I would watch this again.  Enjoy!",1451692800,,1868,4.799373040752351

3663061,1,B001K2LFNI,There are many aspects of this movie I found stupid.  The main character acted as though she was still in high school.  Her lack of professionalism shows when she goes off to sleep with one of the school's dance instructors but changes her mind when she finds out her boyfriend (who she would be cheating on) is the one who sent the instructor to check out her dance skills.

3663070,3,B001K2LFNI,"I just can't wrap my head around all of these reviews that rave about the dancing in this movie. One of the things that made the first Center Stage so great was how authentic it was about the lives of dancers all the way down to the intro showing how dancers break in their pointe shoes. Anyone with the slightest bit of ballet knowledge or training will likely find themselves cringing through the dance sequences in this film - most especially those by the lead female. You would think someone in the production crew would have at least taught her to tie her pointe shoe ribbons properly. And that is just the start. Terrible turnout, sickled feed, arms held up by the shoulders, awful feet and on and on.  I could almost forgive this if her hip hop were incredible, but sadly, it is just mediocre.
Yes it's a cute movie, but much like the regurgitated storyline of so many other hip hop/street dancer meets ballet or vice versa. I am always glad when they make any type of movie about dance, as it helps keep the dance world afloat. However, it just maddens me when I think of all the incredibly talented dancers in studios around the country who could have filled these roles. Yet instead a non-dancer is cast who really isn't that great of an actress either.
Overall, watch it on a rainy day, but if you have any dance background, prepare to try to ignore the complete lack of training and technique in the dance sequences.",1447977600,,1428,4.492307692307692

Peter Gallagher was good as always and ""Cooper"", the instructor, is a phenomenal dancer...his rendition of Tommy's solo was definitely the highlight of this film. All in all, though they are cute enough, the main characters kind of ruined the film.

3663097,3,B001K2LFNI,"Timing is what kept this heart-warming tale from being great. The timing should have held a rhythm just as any dance beat. But they missed the mark. The acting would have been ratcheted up a notch better if they had sped up the dialogue. The music was seamlessly introduced and the dance numbers were on par with great choreography. The speaking allowed for ""dumb exposition"" thinking the audience was too slow to get it. We're smart, and in this day and age, we have rewind if we do not hear the dialogue clearly, not to mention Closed captioning.

3663116,2,B001K2LFNI,"For a movie that repeatedly touts the importance of ""fire"" in dancing, it completely lacked any heat.

Dancing:  Most of the dancing was mediocre ballet.  No wow moments.  Flop of an ending.  Best part was hip hop dancing, but that was sparse and reigned in.  I suspect the male lead is a pretty good hip hop dancer, but he never got to completely bring it.

Acting:  In place of acting, the female lead just nervously grinned the entire movie.  Unfortunately, it made her character seem like a teenager, so it was difficult to relate to her as a romantic heroine.  Gorgeous and fit, but she didn't make me feel anything.  Male lead slightly better, but not much.

3663158,3,B001K2LFNI,"So...where do I begin?

The Bad:
-not remotely close to center stage. Despite it being about ballet people.
-there are some rocky spots in the dancing. What made Step Up and all other great dance movies well...great was the smooth and effortless transition in the dances. I felt like some of the dances had moments where moves were forced and/or awkward.
-The acting wasn't terrible, but what really got to me was the main characters voice. It was the same throughout the whole movie, I couldn't tell if she was happy or sad or angry, I had to REALLY look at her face.
- A lot of smiling, I mean....a lot A LOT.
- my gosh...so much grinding and hip maneuvers. Well I guess it all can't be original and unique.
-The tango scene was reallllly random - I mean REALLY.

The Good
- it has potential, if you like dance movies you'll like this one.
-the end is pretty nice....despite the smiling, didn't really fit the mood of the dance.
-It has good moments worth watching.

Do I recommend this? I guess if your a danceflick person. It's not one of my favorites (having seen all of the step up movies, saved the last dance, flashdance, footloose, honey and the real center stage) This would probably be in second to last place. Last being the latest footloose >.>;; which I couldn't sit through.

Some of the dancing is really questionable,especially when Kate does the Hip-Hop scenes. Everyone makes it seem she was so great when the fact was the opposite. And could a UN-schooled Dancer who has only watched videos and learns to mimic the dance moves,really win the top lead in a major Ballet?

Cooper Neilson is a tame tabby compared to the fiery bad boy from the first movie. Sure he throws in a couple of mild, token protests during the film but for the most part just trails along in Jonathan's wake. And the end scene between Suzanne Von Stroh and Kate is laughable. The spiteful girl of the entire film is suddenly like ""Aw yeah, you should have had that part, my bad"" ? I sincerely doubt that actually really happens just about anywhere.

3663212,2,B001K2LFNI,"I was in the mood for a good dance movie and looked at all the stars, the good feedback, and thought I could get lost in this one. So I ordered the DVD.

Well I am a fan of the character development of the original movie, the lovely choreography and the interplay. None of that is in this movie. The choreography - no real attention was given to this. The characters were mostly flat and the lead female really didn't move me when she danced, be it in the club or on the floor. The two male character from the first movie - where pretty much an expanded cameo. The blonde dancer did pretty much the same routine from the first movie...with the same expertise, but seemed to lack passion. I like his new haircut but he appear THIN...like almost anorexic.

There was SO much missing in this sequel that was in the first - the script is quite lacking - that it is best to just skip it or rent the last Step Up movie.",1393632000,,913,4.181818181818182

The story line is trite and predictable, but so what, the plots of most romances are pretty predictable, boy meets girl, something happens, boy gets girl.  It's how we like things.

3663231,1,B001K2LFNI,"I watched this movie expecting something at least half as good as and something like the original.  What I got was the opposite.  The first Center Stage was more of an introspective look at the various types of dancers that attend an academy as prestigious and as pressure filled as The American Ballet Academy.  It also shows to some degree what those dancers go through to achieve their goals and how for whatever reasons they are or aren't suited to be professional dancers.  This film, while the dancing was great, was nothing more than a knock-off of the very first Step Up film and that was all it was.  The only difference is the person that wants to make it is a girl instead of a guy and the dancer wants to get into the American Ballet Academy.  The acting was okay and the choreography was decent, but that is about all this film has going for it.  Unless a person seriously loves the first Step Up film I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone who is expecting a film like the first Center Stage.  Personally I loved the first Center stage film and was seriously disappointed by this film!",1356134400,,1101,4.47

3663245,4,B001K2LFNI,"""Centre Stage: Turn It up"" is a worthy sequel to the first ""Center [i.e., Centre] Stage"" film (the earlier one subtitled ""Life Doesn`t Hold Tryouts""), but not quite of the same level of interest either as drama or as dance. There is more dance of modern pop styles (rap, hip-hop) in this nice sequel than there is ballet, though both are present in the two films, the difference in that regard being one of balance. Ballet (and some glamourous Hollywood/Broadway show dancing, too) is more prominent in the original (i.e., in ""Life Doesn`t Hold Tryouts""), with much more dancing of all styles in that film by the entrancing Ethan Stiefel, who, however, does enough dancing in ""Turn It up"", in classical and pop styles, to justify obtaining the second DVD as well as the first, which had been, however, more of a showcase for him.

The storyline of ""Turn It up"" is not quite so engrossing as that of the interweaving plot constituents of ""Life Doesn`t Hold Tryouts"", but the later motion picture does hold the interest between the dance sequences, which are well integrated into the plot. Kenny Wormald, the the adorably boyish and muscular principal male protagonist in ""Turn It up"", is a fine dancer in his own right; it is his acting that is not quite so up to the level of that of the delightfully insouciant and self-confidently genial Ethan Stiefel, who, fortunately, is in both movies (and in ""Life Doesn`t Hold Tryouts"" as the main male figure of that film).

My recommendation is to buy both ""Centre Stage"" films, if one really has a passion for dance in all of its forms, as I do. If star calibre acting and dancing is the shopper's overridingly chief interest, then the first film is the more essential of the two to purchase for his personal collection.",1325808000,,1764,4.705501618122978
