3102603,3,B00136MBU2,"This is the fifth (count em FIVE) release of this series on DVD and what most people fail to comment on is the actual DVD release itself.  Yes, Victory at Sea was one of the best naval warfare series presented with actual B&W footage with narration by Leonard Graves and the music by Richard Rodgers as in ALL the Victory at sea releases whether it is a DVD or VHS edition.  St. Clair Vision (2007), Mill Creek Entertainment (2005), A&E Entertainment (the History Channel version) (2003), Emson (2004?)  and now St. Clair Entertainment 2008 re-release re-packaged edition, all have versions out and EVERYONE comments on the series instead of the actual quality of the DVD set itself.

Emson is the company that sells 50 movies for $9.95 on 4 DVD and you get what you pay for.  The same goes for their Victory at Sea version- unwatchable as the DVD's lock up or skip like crazy.  Not bad considering I picked it up on a clearance rack for $5 at a discounter that sells mostly clothes.  The audio video quality is better for the others but none have gone through (if any) restoration and one is just as good as another.  A small bonus is the History Channel version that has a Peter Graves (no relation to Leonard) introduction overview for the uninitiated of the proceding episode.  If you can't Peter Graves, then any other version would suffice but stay away from the el-cheapo versions out there as most of older series, movies and shows are public domain for any ""studio"" out there who is willing to put them on DVD and make a buck.  Hence, the multiple versions of the same series of Victory at Sea that are floating around out there.",1219708800,25,1638,4.559726962457338
3102604,5,B00136MBU2,"This ""Victory at Sea"" is an excellent re-mastering of an American classic.  The video and sound quality must be close to the original, considering the extensive use of actual WWII film footage.  The series still captures the immensity of the Nation's sacrifices needed to help win the war.  This is more real history than Hollywood, and it makes one reflect on how relatively secure the United States has been since World War II. The Richard Rodgers soundtrack seems timeless.  One might find oneself humming the melodies days after watching ""Victory at Sea"".
Highly recommended.",1219449600,6,579,5.127659574468085
3102605,5,B00136MBU2,"Of the ""Budget"" priced editions available on the market -the one produced by ST.CLAIR VISION is the best available quality. The transfer of 50 year old film footage to DVD was well done -GOOD picture and sound quality. Complaints from other reviewers about there being only 15 epidsodes on the DVDs are untrue - If you go into the epidsode selection Menu and look for the ARROW icon which is  just to the right of where it says MAIN MENU-and CLICK on the arrow - you bring up another menu page with the ""Missing Epidsodes"" - Problem Solved! If you are a big fan WWII documentaries this DVD set is a ""Must Have""!",1218067200,17,611,4.407079646017699

3102607,5,B00136MBU2,"This complete edition of all 26 hours of Victory at Sea is the first really well done remastering since the original release many years back in Laser Disc. It is superior to the current History Channel release (without the superfluous H-Channel introductions). It brings me back to Sunday afternoons over dinner in our den as we watched the original broadcasts on an exceptional (for its time) 21"" B&W TV. Archival footage is just that, but the presentation appears quite well on a 52"" rear-projection monitor. The music track (Richard Rodgers beautiful music) along with Graves excellent narration is nicely done in Dolby. This was a true pioneering effort in documenting WWII and, specifically, the war at sea. While somewhat dated in production values, the overall product is a must for any serious collector, student or enthusiast.",1209513600,62,835,5.147058823529412

8249363,5,B00136MBU2,"A classic account of  WWII at sea. Amazing footage, excellent writing and Richard Rodgers' beautiful, haunting soundtrack. Television documentary at its best.  I recall watching this with family growing up and over  the years on PBS.  Glad to have my own copy. Played it over Memorial Day weekend.",1498694400,,297,5.125
8249364,1,B00136MBU2,Never received it and the preveyor took a very long time to refund my money and only after I contacted him two or three tines.,1264982400,,126,4.08
8249365,3,B00136MBU2,"This was purchased as a birthday gift for my husband, a retired U.S. Marine.  He had often mentioned his memories of enjoying this series with his Dad.  He was delighted with my gift and could hardly wait for the family celebration to end so he could sit back in his lounger and watch this set.  Imagine mine and his devastation with the poor quality of the visuals and sound.  In this technological age, I see no reason that the audio and visuals of this award-winning, historically-significant series could not be re-mastered and enhanced.  Film makers spend hundreds of millions on pop trite like: Spiderman, Harry Potter, Ironman, etc. Is it too much to ask that a few thousand be spent to make this series enticing to those of us who remember ""The Great War"" and those of this generation who should remember?  I do not regret purchasing this item. Until something better comes along, I urge you to do so too.",1251158400,2,913,4.6397515527950315

8249367,4,B00136MBU2,"I enjoyed the episodes of Victory at Sea when I was a child and looked forward to seeing the complete series on DVD.  Unfortunately, I did not find the footage nearly as enjoyable as I remembered.  My biggest problem was with the music which was more of an annoying distraction away from these great clashes at sea than an enhancement to what is otherwise compelling footage.  The great drama of these heroic sea encounters is also diminished by the ongoing wartime propaganda that, although understandable for its time and is part of the historic nature of the film, unfortunately, is pervasive in this series.  And, too often, there appeares little purpose to the film clips other than to display American sea power and might through a blase of guns and bombs. Beyond this, however, the pictures are historic and, for the most part, quite gripping.",1245110400,,850,4.841379310344828
8249368,4,B00136MBU2,"I have very fond memories of watching this series with my Dad when it was originally broadcast.

The DVDs were well done - good quality video and audio - and as memorable as I remembered from my childhood.  I only wish my Dad was still here to provide his own comments and viewpoint.",1227916800,2,283,4.320754716981132
8249369,4,B00136MBU2,"This was a magnificent achievement in its day. As a teenager I eagerly awaited every episode. Thrilling, especially since much of the footage had been captured from the Japanese and Germans and even images made by Americans had not been seen in the moviehouse newsreels. Seeing it again at age 72 I now realize that it was heavy on atmosphere but short on details. The pictures are still powerful and worth seeing again and again, but this is not really a history of WWII. It is primarily about the men and their day-to-day perils--battles and boredom. Many notable battles are merely mentioned (as if we should know of them, as we did back then) and the few action sequences are severely curtailed (less than five minutes to capture Iwo Jima, for instance). Nonetheless, this is a series that captured the eyes of America and though the focus is on the Navy personnel, every branch of the service has its moments. The price, incidentally, makes this a terrific bargain and a terrific stocking stuffer for veterans of that and future campaigns.",1226966400,3,1044,4.805555555555555
8249370,1,B00136MBU2,"I'm a history fan and I was really excited when I got this set as a gift.  The Series is a collection of footage from different countries that participated in the War.  The idea of presenting the War from different vantage points was appealing, and this approach seemed ideal for bringing together complex naval operations.  The best lessons that the Series presents are probably how not to make a naval documentary.

The starting credits for Victory at Sea is rolling ocean scene, with the camera bobbing up and down and the horizon shifting and tilting.  After about two minutes of this you're ready for a Dramamine.  This seems like a film making faux pas: don't make your audience vomit.

Broadway music and war epics don't mix.  The music and the scenes seem to be mismatched: as German dive bombers are destroying London, the music almost whimsical.  The music is constant, and unrelenting.  Without the footage and the narrative, you could be watching a Looney Tunes cartoon and a chase scene with Foghorn-Leghorn.

If the opening credits didn't make you nauseous, the narrative will.  The narrative is riddled with clichs and hyperbole.  As ships are getting bombed, the narrator seems to compelled to constantly explain: ships on fire, ships sinking and men dying.  Between the music and the narrative, it almost seems like they made the film for radio broadcast.

The biggest failure of this series is that it does a terrible job with explaining history.  There are few maps showing locations and positions of ships.  The maps they do show are vague and not very useful.  The documentary series ""Why We Fight"" does a better job at explaining wartime tactics and the Axis threat.",1224547200,3,1688,4.883802816901408
8249371,5,B00136MBU2,"This is a very good series, BUT there needs to be instruction on seeing all of the episodes.  I found it in another review, click the ARROW next to main menu.  I was some upset to think that I only got 15 of the 26 episodes.",1222560000,8,224,3.847826086956522
8249372,4,B00136MBU2,Seeing the Series Vactory at Sea has returned me to my childhood where we knew that it was the right thing to fight the bad guy. This series presents the events in it's historic proportions.,1221523200,,190,4.457142857142857
