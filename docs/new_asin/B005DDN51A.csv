4657916,1,B005DDN51A,"I purchased this set and found that this set did not contain 5 discs with 10 movies, it only had 4 discs with the first 8 movies.
It did not contain ""The Kettles in the Ozarks / The Kettles on Old MacDonald's Farm"" and therefore not the complete set as indicated.
The outside box is mislabled by saying it contains 5 discs and 10 movies.  The fact is that it is only 4 discs and 8 movies.
Anyone else experience this?",1317168000,5,417,4.148148148148148
4657917,5,B005DDN51A,"This is a very endearing and lovable series which is all about funny things that happen in Ma and Pa Kettle's home and all the mischiefs that their fifteen offspring's are up to.

The series started with The Egg and I (1947) starring my favourite actress Claudette Colbert. Her Husband  Fred MacMurray buys a property in the suburbs which actually is a village with the idea of setting up a Egg Farm and earning profit from it. But all his efforts fall apart as one misfortune after another follows and Claudette Colbert's patience is umpteenth time tested. Ma and Pa Kettle are their neighbour played by MARJORIE MAIN and PERCY KILBRIDE.After this movie Ma and Pa Kettle series started which continued for 9 more movies which still delight audience with their riotous humour and crazy antics.

Marjorie Main is tall heavy built and powerful,she is the brainy and decisive one. Percy Kilbride is thin unassuming,lazy and speaks in dragging voice. Their are two Red Indians too who work on their farm.

Most remarkable is the dinner time when Ma shouts ""come and get it"" and all fifteen kids rush in to the dinner table. There's a old radio which change channels whenever Pa jumps on his rocking chair. Then there are those hens who keep laying eggs in unimaginable places especially in guest's hats. Once they are shown in a really modern house with all kinds of innovative gadgets beating even those new James Bond movies. They keep taking part in various contests and keep winning strange prizes. Once a convict hoodwinks them to stay in the house and look after children while they are gone. But kids prove to be too much for him. A bit of TinTin like adventure here too when a guy a asks Pa to deliver an envelope to himself in Paris but gets killed on arrival in his hotel room. Pa and Ma with their sensible friend manage to outsmart crooks.

Marjorie Main was famous for talking on the set to her dead husband! In some cases, they'd have to re-shoot scenes because she'd just start having conversations with him out of the blue! Apparently she was a very, very eccentric lady!!

Movie of this series are great family movies which you can watch again and again.",1315612800,69,2167,4.64490861618799

4658122,1,B005DDN51A,"Not sure how everyone else found these funny since they were stressful to watch, and I cringed at the stereotyping: Pa is a lazy good for nothing guy, Ma is a complaining, beaten-down-by-life older woman, with wild children running amok. The way the neighbors treat the Kettles is equally appalling.  This ""comedy"" collection lacks the charm of the Beverly Hillbillies, which is a far better poke at cultural/socio-economic differences between people, if you're looking for this sort of fun.

The actress that plays Ma seems to have made a career out of playing this type of character - same character appears in Meet Me in St. Louis and The Egg and I, where she has a more limited role and is amusing I think because of her limited screen time.  Having her complaining as the main storyline is just too much.  My kids hated these too.",1455580800,,835,4.698630136986301

Sure, it's hokey--that was their charm to begin with.  They are also classic comedy characters.  For those of us who are far from young it is a reminder of our childhood, often accompanied by good memories.

It is a fantastic collection to pass on to future generations by making new memories, whether it is accompanied by popcorn, a taffy pull, or a cup of hot cocoa.  It's clean fun, and just hokey enough that nothing is lost despite the decades that have passed since they were filmed.  (All before I was born anyhow.)",1438819200,5,684,4.565573770491803

4658275,5,B005DDN51A,Watched these when I was youngster on Saturday and Sunday TV matinees.  Pa Kettle is a thinking man but not a working one and spends all of his time thinking of ways to get others to do his work!  Ma Kettle is a harried mother of 15 who has deal with Pa's idle ways and watching over her sizable brood.  It makes for many good hearted comedic moments from these films of yester year. I wished the entertainment of today had the same warm clean fun of these forgotten gems.,1421366400,,472,4.222222222222222

4658290,5,B005DDN51A,"Not only a bonus of a complete ten movie series, they are all fun and family friendly. Kilbride (Pa) only stared in the first 8 as he disliked the role. The 9th film only has letters from ""pa"" read and the tenth film has a new ""Pa"". Though it's immediately apparent he's not the same pa, after watching the film I had a hard time recalling the face of Kilbride, so I guess he fit the role. Ma (Main, was good in most of the films, but it was apparent after a while she was now and then hamming it up for the role, but overall her role was consistent.

  The movies are a sort of early Beverly Hillbillies but with more kids (15) To not watch them too fast i spread the viewing over a long time. I re-watched a couple and they were still fun. less than a year later. The humor varies from slapstick and silly to folksy. I enjoyed all of the ten though some were better than others but I would say at least 7 or 8 were just comfy cosey oh goodie another Ma and Pa movie I couldn't wait to watch..sometimes the sillyness was almost too silly, like the 15 kids on a rope in a line being pulled by a single small dog...come on.... Still, though some of the jokes were lame and predictable, yet in some ways that was also part of their charm. If your sick of people getting blowed up real good, and blud n guts and sick icky bedroom scenes and want just some good old fashioned fun, you probably couldn't get a better ten film set.

  I had no trouble at all with loading any of the 5 discs on my cheap $10 excess cargo dvd player and only spotted one tiny glitch in the playing, which might have been a fluke.",1418947200,,1604,4.076190476190476

Even though Ms Main made many other movies, she was never quite able to shake the Ma Kettle association.  She was a great actress and it is a shame she was oft overlooked at award time for her acting abilities in some of her other than ""Ma"" roles.  Mr Kilbride also starred in other movies but never seemed to lose his ""Pa"" stigmatism either.  All in all, the Kettles are timeless entertainment.",1416182400,,583,4.576923076923077

The kettles live just yonder o'er the way, raising their many children. The house is a mess, Pa doesn't care for work but, somehow, everyone is healthy and happy. The epitome of a loving family.

The comedy and antics continue with Ma & Pa Kettle going to town, the Ozarks, and even Hawaii. This is still (classic) family fun for anyone and everyone!",1412985600,,685,4.428571428571429

4658373,3,B005DDN51A,"Ma & Pa Kettle Complete Comedy Collection

Betty MacDonald wrote the book The Egg & I about her experiences as a chicken farmer in Washington state. This was turned into a Hollywood movie that had Ma and Pa Kettle as comic characters. They were popular enough to lead to a series of movies until their audience diminished. These movies were often shown on broadcast TV in the 1950s and early 1960s. Viewing them after five decades you see them as low-budget comedies. How do they compare to the TV comedies of that era, or today? In those days egg producing was a small family-owned business. A local middleman (like Billy Reed) would buy the eggs and transport them to town for marketing. Chickens would be placed into small cages and transported to a local store that would sell them dressed or undressed.

One interesting part is the culture and outlook from these stories. Note the familiarity with firearms. It was never turned into a TV series, unless it inspired Green Acres. Do you know how eggs and chickens are produced today? When was the last time you saw live chickens for sale? These movies are now as obsolete as the popular Westerns of the 1930s-1940s, or the detective movies of the 1940s (film noir). There were two other movies made later with a replacement for Pa Kettle.

Volume 1 has four movies.
The Egg and I (1947);
The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle (1949);
Ma and Pa Kettle Go to Town (1949);
Ma and Pa Kettle Back on the Farm (1951).

Volume 2 has four movies..
Ma and Pa Kettle at the Fair (1951);
Ma and Pa Kettle on Vacation (1953);
Ma and Pa Kettle at Home (1954);
Ma and Pa Kettle at Waikiki (1955).

In the interest of comedy I would like to suggest a final movie to end this series: Ma and Pa Kettle Go to the Big House. Government officials became curious about the expensive travels of the Kettle family. Their investigation showed no unusual buying pattern of items that could be used for moonshine. A visual inspection found a plot of land that had green-leaved plants and a drying shed hidden behind their hen-house. Arrests followed. Ma and Pa Kettle retained the services of the famous trial lawyer firm Dewey, Cheatham, & Howe. They were able to get a reduced sentence. Afterwards the Kettles moved to another state (some said Idaho). Some said they suspected why Pa was so relaxed and laid-back.",1407888000,,2347,4.605263157894737

(A ticket for an afternoon's entertainment was 14 cents, which--having been given two dimes--left enough for a 5-cent drink and a penny in the Boston bean candy machine.)  The movies were hilarious then and still are--good, clean, oddball fun.

4658463,5,B005DDN51A,"These Ma & Pa Kettle films were so enjoyable to see in theaters when I was young. Percy Kilbride was always hilarious. It's my understanding that Percy Kilbride left the filming after eight episodes and Marjorie Main did not have him at her side for the two remaining films.

Sad to see that he was killed as a pedestrian by a speeding car in or near Los Angeles. A friend who was with him died instantly but I believe Percy Kilbride lived a few more weeks. A survivor from World War I, yet this tragic event at or near his home ended his life.

Viewing the Ma and Pa Kettle collection again was delightful as ever. I was recapturing  Saturdays of my youth at home once again, on the couch, with popcorn in a tub.  Like most things from the past, I thought my rose colored glasses would have made it appear better than it actually was. Happily, I was  not to be disappointed in this instance. Each movie was as delightful as the next, and the black and white cinematic filter was still charming and soft, making the world of the  Kettles seem more attractive than life on a real farm.
The quality of the reproduction on CD was excellent. The child - like plots,  like all good stories were gently indulgent to Pa's laziness, and way ahead of their time, the writers indicated with subtle humor, how ludicrous racial prejudice was and still is. Ma, the strong mother figure always knew best, in this make belief world, and was ever the homely lovable character we all perhaps dream of having in a Matriarch of a family. Lovable, wonderful dream world fun!!",1345766400,3,1207,5.35978835978836

4658576,5,B005DDN51A,"Many people have fond memories of Ma and Pa Kettle, a wonderfully hick, but somehow hip comedy team.  Ma (Marjorie Main) and Pa, (Percy Kilbride) were laid back parents of fifteen youngsters.  In 1947 they co-starred with Claudette Colbert and Fred MacMurray in ""The Egg and I,"" the first film in this series.  Their outlandish personalities drew in an audience that launched their careers.  In this particular set there are two movies on each DVD.  If you are old enough to have actually seen them at the movies when you were a kid you'll love seeing them as much as those who saw the reruns every now and then in future decades.

My only disappointment was when Parker Fennelly was cast as Pa in ""The Kettles on Old MacDonald's Farm.""  No doubt his performance was stellar, but the ""real"" Pa was inimitable and somehow irreplaceable.  Regardless, this madcap post Vaudevillian comedy series is great entertainment and I enjoyed going back in time to watch the unforgettable team of Ma and Pa Kettle.

THE MOVIES:

(1) The Egg and I (1 hr. 48 minutes, 1947)

Two newly weds, Betty (Claudette Colbert) and Bob (Fred MacMurray) try their hand at chicken farming.  This is the first time Ma and Pa Kettle are seen on the screen.

(2) Ma and Pa Kettle (1 hr. 16 minutes, 1949)

The Kettles, who live in a dilapidated farmhouse, end up living in a futuristic home when Pa wins the King Henry Tobacco Company slogan contest.

(3)  Ma and Pa Kettle Go to Town (1 hr. 20 minutes, 1950)

Pa simple doesn't settle for winning the ""house-of-the-future,"" he decides to enter another contest held by the Bubble-Ola company.  An all expenses paid trip to New York City is on the agenda, but who will take care of the kids?

(4)  Ma and Pa Kettle Back on the Farm ( 1 hr., 21 minutes, 1951)

Once Ma and Pa get back from New York they find there will be a new addition to the family.  Just who is going to have a new baby?  It's not Ma, but when they have Boston blue blood come to visit, all heck breaks loose.

(5)  Ma and Pa Kettle at the Fair (1 hr. 19 minutes, 1952)

Rosie has to go to college, but somehow Ma and Pa Kettle have to come up with the money.  Ma is going to enter some contests at the fair trying to beat out the old bat, Birdie Hicks.  Pa buys an old nag pawned off to him as a race horse.  Who was going to bring home enough money to pay Rosie's college tuition?

(6) Ma and Pa Kettle on Vacation (1 hr., 16 minutes, 1953)

Ma and Pa Kettle are heading to Paris with their in-laws, Jonathan and Elizabeth Parker (Ray Collins and Barbara Brown).  On the way to Paris a shady character asks Pa to carry an envelope for him and give it back to them at the hotel.  A bit of murder and mayhem await the Kettles in Paris!

(7)  Ma and Pa Kettle at Home (1 hr., 22 minutes, 1954)

Ma and Pa's son Elwin (Brett Halsey) writes an essay about their thoroughly modern farm in order to win a scholarship from a national magazine.  What's going to happen when the judges come and find out the place is a dump?

(8)  Ma and Pa Kettle at Waikiki (1 hr., 19 minutes, 1955)

Cousin Rodney Kettle lives in Waikiki and is having business trouble on his pineapple plantation.  The only one who can possibly save the business is his cousin, Pa Kettle.  (This is the last episode for Percy Kilbride as he became ill during the filming).

(9)  The Kettles in the Ozarks (1 hr. 21 minutes, 1956)

Ma and the kids head out to help Pa's brother, Sedgewick, who isn't a much better farmer than Pa.  He also has that ""don't wanna work"" attitude and when some shady characters want to rent his barn he's all for it.  Just what are they up to?

(10)  The Kettles on Old MacDonald's Farm (1 hr., 21 minutes, 1957)

Ma and Pa (Parker Fennelly) Sally and Brad when they get married.  Sally, who has no idea how difficult farm life can be, is in for one big surprise when everything seems to go wrong.",1324512000,60,3875,4.297783933518006

4658581,5,B005DDN51A,"In 1946 Author Betty MacDonald wrote a Best Seller ""The Egg and I"".  In 1947 Universal Pictures made it into one of the most popular movies starring Oscar Winner Claudette Colbert & Fred MacMurray as a newly wed city folk gone country chicken farmers.  And Majorie Main & Percy Kilbride as; ""MA & PA KETTLE"" the mad cap country neighbors with 15 kids.  ""The Egg and I"" and the Kettles were so popular that Universal Pictures made a sequel starring the ""Kettles"" in ""The Further Adventures of Ma Aand Pa Kettle"" IN 1949. Again so successful were the Kettles 9 more hilarious films followed. Main & Kilbride were the perfect team & the first Beverly Hillbilly type comedies.

All 10 films on 5 disks are Standard Format and in Black & White remastered pisture and sound (Excellent quality even on a blu-ray player).
The original release of the series was released on DVD in 2004 in 2 volumes with 4 films per set.  NOTE: the last 2 films; The Kettles  in the Ozarks and The Kettles on Old MacDonalds Farm weren't included in the original since Percy Kilbride (due to illness he was absent from them). (Kettles vs Ma & Pa).

Summary: Disk 1 ""The Egg and I""* - (1947) has newly weds Bob & Betty MacDonald (Colbert & MacMurray) giving up the city life for the life of chicken farmers ""EGGS"" in the state of Washington.  Their 40 acre run down farm becomes the a real challenge along with their scatterbrained/madcap nighbors the destitute Kettle clan (with 15 kids).This is an Outstanding story, perfect ensemble cast with hilarious results. The perfect launch title for the ""Kettles"". Next came; ""MA & PA Kettle"" (1949) - The procrastinating PA's (Kilbride) obsession to enter contests proves to be a winner. The fun really begins now, the Grand prize is a new hi-tech style house of the future.  Disk 2 ""Ma & Pa Kettle Go to Town""* (1950) - Pa wins another contest. A trip to New York City.  Who will babysit their 15 helluns so they can go?  ""Ma & Pa Kettle Back on the Farm"" (1951) - Ma & Pa are to become Grandparents and the rich high society in-laws are coming to stay with the Kettles to visit their Grand Son.  Disk 3 ""Ma & Pa Kettle At the Fair""* (1952) - Pa enters a harness race.  ""Ma & Pa Kettle On Vacation""* (1953) - The Kettles in Paris, France involved with espionage & Spies.  Disk 4 ""Ma & Pa Kettle At Home"" (1954) - The House of the future is needing repairs from neglect.  ""Ma & Pa Kettle At Waikiki""* (1955) - Pa cons a visit to rich cousin Pineapple plantation. (Kilbrides last appearance as Pa due to illness).  Disk 5 These last 2 films are finally added to complete the Kettles Series Collection.  ""The Kettles in the Ozarks"" (1955) - Ma and the kids visit relatives in the Ozarks.  ""The Kettles on Old MacDonalds Farm"" (1957) - This is the last film and Parker Fennelly plays PA KETTLE. This is kind of an appropiate conclusion to this series since Bob & Betty MacDonald (from ""The Egg and I"") was the introduction of the Kettle clan and now we say good bye.  * Includes Theatrical Trailer.

This Complete Collection is loaded with pure fun and laughter.  Allows us to revisit the comedies of the 1940's & 50's and see how the simplest situations creates the gift of laughter..

4658585,5,B005DDN51A,"Uni's new release of the MA & PA KETTLE films is remarkable for two reasons.  One, the movies are presented on single-sided discs (2 films per disc).  Two, they included the last two films in the series.  Sadly, it took TCM to license the last two films (which they titled THE FURTHER ADVENTURES OF THE KETTLES) for Universal to even have the reason (and the new transfers) to issue this complete set.  The last two films are presented in anamorphic widescreen 1.85:1.  At least 4 of the others should have been, but Universal just lazily used the same full-frame (open matte) transfers from the previous releases.  Those quibbles aside, bravo to Universal for getting this set out at a very affordable price.
