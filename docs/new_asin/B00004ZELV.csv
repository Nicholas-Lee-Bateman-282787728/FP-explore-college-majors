1383786,5,B00004ZELV,"WOW!  This is a stellar disc!  You've never seen Reboot until you see it with the crystal clarity of DVD.  The colors, the details never looked so amazing!  Even if you've seen it on TV, Reboot is definately one DVD to own.  Lots of neat little extras like animation tests and concept drawings make this disc a must buy.  I only wish it had closed captioning.  Check out the trailer section for a preview of War Planets/Shadow Raiders coming soon to DVD too! The only bad news about this series is that another company hold the rights to seasons 1 & 2, so we may never see the entire Reboot series on DVD.  I hope other Mainframe series like Weird-Oh's, Beast Wars and Beast Machines soon follow!  My fingers are crossed!",975888000,19,721,4.442748091603053
1383787,5,B00004ZELV,"I hope that they will eventually put all the episodes of Reboot on DVD!  The episodes deserve DVD because the quality of the whole series is just eye candy!  I wished that they would continue the plot w/ the new Bob and Dot.  I will collect them all!  Please start doing the rest of the seasons, prehaps two on a DVD??  I am certian these DVD's will get a good response!  Please support this show, I know I will do my part :-)",972000000,,426,4.072289156626506
1383788,5,B00004ZELV,"With the departure of the censors, ReBoot defied the odds, and became even better. Without spoiling anything, I will simply state that the characters have to come to grips with some very hard times, and some losses of hope in light of a terribly evil individual, Megabyte. The first four episodes of Season 3 (To Mend and Defend, Between a Raccoon and a Hard Place, Firewall, and Game Over) detail young Enzo's emergency promotion to Guardian of Mainframe, and the responsibility that comes with it. At the same time, Megabyte uses every manipulative trick in the book to make the public hate Enzo. It begins in tragedy and ends in tragedy.
It was about time this Computer-Animated show made it to DVD. Now all we need is for the first two seasons to follow suit.",971049600,20,763,4.659259259259259
1383789,5,B00004ZELV,"This is an excelent cartoon!  Great animation, characture development, and story!  I have most of these on VHS but am gana recollect them on DVD.  Buy these they are Great.",971049600,3,172,4.666666666666667
1383790,5,B00004ZELV,"I've wished for this to be released for AGES!  (Still wishing for the first two groundbreaking seasons, though.)

I'm so excited!  The DVD is just what I expected.  The series itself is as good as I remembered.  As the editor of 80sCartoons.net, I have seen a lot, and I mean a LOT, of cartoons after their time, and this one is JUST as good as the first time I saw it.  I can't say that of many cartoons.  Only a small handful.  The characters, the character development, the storylines, the humor...first class.  Edgy.  FUN.  Yes, that's the bottom line here.  It's a FUN show to watch.  Isn't that the point?",1109289600,3,611,4.445454545454545
1383791,3,B00004ZELV,"I am a HUGE Reboot fan.  It was a landbreaking series in digital animation.  The characters were all well developed and the stories were well written.  I was sad to see it get canceled and only recently learned that it had gone on to cable t.v.  So I jumped at the chance to buy the entire series.  I was so excited!  I am sooooo disappointed that Volume One is NOT Season One.  It is difficult for me to share it with others, as they have no background.  Some of it is hard for me to understand too, since Bob was alive and kicking when I last saw the show.
For all the fans of this awesome series -- I ask the producers to please release Seasons 1 & 2, so our collections will be complete.  This is animation history.",1062288000,20,719,4.115107913669065
1383792,5,B00004ZELV,"The editor of this review is clearly an angry old man with no appreciation for a fun, exciting cartoon.  These take place at the beginning of season three, after the web has invaded mainframe.  The James Bond-style of the Firewall opening is great, as is the episode itself.  ""Game Over"" is the definately one of the best pre-net episodes in the series.  The only thing that upsets me is that there is no ""volume 0"" with the episodes for season one (""Opening Sequence"", ""Racing the Clock"", ""Medusa Bug"", ""The TIFF"", and ""Talent Night"") or season two (""Infected"", ""Painted Windows"", ""AndrAI"", ""Nullzilla"", ""Gigabyte"", ""Trust No One"", and ""Web World Wars"").  However, this DVD gets my thumbs up!",1051315200,13,693,4.939655172413793
1383793,2,B00004ZELV,"As a fan of Reboot I was thrilled that I might see the entire collection. Although DVD's are sold as Volumes they only contain a few episodes.  Not near enough to enjoy the true richness of the series.  When I purchased ALL 4 volumes some even purported to be ""seasons"" I expected to get just that.  Not 4 selected epsiodes from each year.  I would have GLADLY paid more to actually get what I wanted.  ...",1051142400,11,406,4.2894736842105265
1383794,5,B00004ZELV,"Obviosly the person who wrote your editorial has neither an appreciation for good animation nor great storywriting.
Although the [people] at ABC thought Reboot would be a good fare for young children, the writing was meant for older viewers.
Without fans supporting this show and it's type of storytelling, movies like ""ToyStory"" would never have gotten of the drawing board....",1039564800,,378,5.316666666666666
1383795,1,B00004ZELV,"I can't find any other place to ask this except here, but on the season 1-4 on DVD, i see that before I purchase that the lenght is only 90 minutes for each dvd, that is nowhere near the lenght it should be, is it a misprint or did they cut out almost all the episodes from the disc to save money?",1033257600,,297,3.806451612903226
1383796,5,B00004ZELV,"i would give 5 star.. good anime, no regret on the purchase.",1033171200,,60,4.083333333333333
1383797,5,B00004ZELV,"CGI series ever on television. Compelling characters, great stories and breathtaking animation make ReBoot one of the finest shows ever to grace tv. These DVDs are must-own items for any fan of animation, certainly for any fan of ReBoot. I only wish seasons 1, 2 and 4 would also come out on DVD. And should the stars align correctly, maybe even a fifth season! Let's hope. We all know the adventure continues...",1023753600,2,412,4.736111111111111
1383798,5,B00004ZELV,"It is a real shame that seasons 1 and 2 (the first half) were soooo lousy. But these season 3 (and 2nd half of season 2) episodes were excellent. I've heard that they intentionally ""dummied-down"" the seasons 1 and 2 so that they could air them in America without offending anybody or ticking off the censors. This wouldn't surprise me condisdering how American TV has managed to ruin some of the best shows--DBZ and Beast Wars (Beast Machines--the American version--was awefull!)
Anyway, when REboot didn't sell in America the Canadian animators were freed the bonds put on them and really cut loose! The humour episodes were the best, they mocked everything from james bond (best reboot ep. EVER) to the Prisoner, to Sailor Moon, to Xena and Hercules. Definitly check this series out!
THE FIREWALL EPISODE, A JAMES BOND SPOOF, REALLY MUST BE SEEN TO BE BELIEVED",1013558400,2,862,4.870748299319728
1383799,5,B00004ZELV,"The editorial reviews should at least be written by someone who knows at least something about the subject, don't you think?  It's obvious that Charles Solomon doesn't know anything about this kind of animation, or even the series he's reviewing.  By the way, Mr. Solomon, the episodes on this DVD are from 1997, not 1994.
This DVD follows the young Enzo Matrix, now the Guardian of Mainframe, as he struggles against the evil virus Megabyte's conquest of the system.  The animation is excellent, and the story is very fun, dramatic, and clever.  Kids and adults will both find lots to love about this DVD.
A true classic in animation history!",1004832000,4,643,4.818181818181818
1383800,5,B00004ZELV,"It is near criminal that Universal hasn't released the rights to seasons I and II.  This is disc starts with the opener to Season III and gives indication to a bit of the very dark nature of this season (and The Web that follows).
Seasons I and II were much more humor oriented with less of a cohesive story that unfolds throughout the season.  Season III is the beginning of what could easily (and was likely originally intended to be) have been a full length movie.
However, Season III contains plenty of the classic Reboot humor.  Example;  Episode I contains an excellent spoof of Evil Dead II right down to the lead characters over sized chin and penchant for saying ""Groovy"".",999734400,2,681,4.603305785123967
1383801,5,B00004ZELV,"I'm 41 years old and is a big fan of British TV and likes of, The Prisoner, UFO, and even Thunderbirds & Captain Scarlet. I believe that the creators of Reboot (left England for Canada) have seen my favorites and bring that same kind senseabilty to the screen for Reboot the Series. I'm also the guy that watched Tron when it first came out on 70mm three times and once with a small group of fellow geeks at the last showing in Vegas. Tron was made for 70mm large projection. 4:3 on 30in TV, Tron still loses that Spectacle experience. Reboot is a series that clearly doen't take itself too seriouly.. but now that ABC ""the ABC's have turned against us!"" dumped the show. (Wonder why since Reboot was roughly 5 years aheaed of anything Disney had a time!!) The animation continues to improve as do family and adult scripts. American networks are [stupid] for not putting Reboot on Prime Time. First all DDD Weekly Animated TV Series. First all DDD recordings. And still the Cartoon Network only broadcasts the show in mono. Same on them. GENE",998611200,,1042,4.577540106951871
1383802,5,B00004ZELV,"My kids (8 and 10) love this animated cartoon as much as I do! The story line is exciting and the humor, gags, one-liners and cultural references keep it interesting for adults as well as children. We especially enjoy the computer references. The computer animation is still better than any of the animation you see in most cartoons on TV today.
I'm very glad to see that other episodes are now available on DVD. We're just hoping they'll bring back the series to TV or even the movies! WE WANT MORE ReBOOT!!!",985392000,5,509,4.543478260869565
1383803,4,B00004ZELV,"I used to watch this show religiously on ABC Saturday mornings, and I was so excited to see it come to DVD.

The first episode, ""To Mend and Defend,"" was mediocre at best. To be fair, I missed all of season two, so it was sort of like coming in during the middle of a movie. Still, I was left scratching my head, trying to remember just why I liked this series so much in the first place.

""Between a Raccoon and a Hard Place"" was silly and, at times, incongruous with the rest of the episodes. By this time, I was ready to pop out the DVD.

Fortunately, ""Firewall"" caught my attention from the beginning. A clever and hilarious spoof of James Bond movies, this episode made me laugh out loud and reminded me how great this series could be.

""Game Over"" was, in a word, incredible. I can't describe it without giving too much away. Just let me say that the cliffhanger ending was enough to send me running to my computer to order the next DVD in the series.

The last two episodes make this DVD worth purchasing. The series creators really know their characters and understand their world, and are more than capable of making up for the occasional sour note struck by the guest writers.",982540800,,1186,4.372727272727273
1383804,5,B00004ZELV,"Well, finally I can start recycling all those VHS tapes I used to tape the series when it was on.  The DVD is much higher res anyway -- the sound and pictures are just at the upper limit of what you can do with this cateogry of equipment.
There will always be people who just don't ""get it"" when watching this series -- it really isn't for everyone.  But for those who know animation, theater, and computer science this will always be something really special.  If you have never seen these before you are in for a treat.",981244800,3,521,4.295918367346939
1383805,5,B00004ZELV,"Dear Mr Solomon, I'm very sorry you didn't like the ReBoot DVD, luckily for us you seem to be in the minority.  I thought I'd take this opportunity to warn you that we are currently  producing ReBoot Season IV. You should avoid watching it, I'm afraid our ""heavy-hands"" are at work again. And you never know, there may even be a ""Charles Solomon Binome"" featured!
""Stay Frosty""
P.S. By the way NO motion capture was used in any of the 3 seasons of ReBoot, please check your facts before your next review.",980121600,30,504,4.467391304347826
1383806,4,B00004ZELV,out of the three seasons that Reboot was on the air this was the best one. By the time mainframe had reached this season you could see numberous changes in how items were depicted. Little things like eye lashes were added in great detail. this is a great section to start in the seres. the third season is full of action and you get to see a little of what each caracter is about.,978393600,,380,4.148648648648648

7928434,5,B00004ZELV,"Thsi is by far one of the most bizarre, yet unique concepts for a TV show I've ever seen.  The amount of work it must've taken to create a masterpiece of a show like this is just mind-blowing to me.  I can't wait to watch the next season!",1367539200,,238,3.9375
7928435,5,B00004ZELV,"I remem ber watching this when I was younger and enjoying it. Even as an adult rewatching it, I still do.
