8328292,4,B001NY42LU,"I bought this Dvd, based on the fact that B5 is my newest favorite boyband and I was curious to know how they started out. Though, I'm slightly older than the guys, I enjoy their urban r&b/hip-hop sound. The Dvd, its'self, is great to watch if you wonder about the boys' musical background and history; ""no doubt."" On one clip, they discuss how their mother influenced them to become skilled dancers, at one point in their lives.(Since their mother was a dancer, herself, too. I thought that-that was amazing on their behalfs.) The camera guy, who films the group while their on the road, is their manager. He seems to be almost a ""father figure"" and close companion in B5's lives, that is rare when it comes to the Music Industry; especially, with management to clients/staff. He truly believes in pushing his group to be the best performers in any show or event. They have absolutely fun and outgoing personalities. I wish I had of known about them, while I was in my early teen yrs.",1265155200,,985,4.6022727272727275
8328293,5,B001NY42LU,This DVD is definitely worth the money. This DVD is great for B5 fans and also great for people who wish to learn more about B5.,1248912000,,128,3.9615384615384617
8328294,5,B001NY42LU,"As a die hard B5 fan, I absolutely luved this video! Yes, the footage is very home-ish but that's because it was made with a home video camera! That actually adds to the personality of the film which is a personal and intimate account of the evolution of the Breeding brothers. It's great! If you are a B5 fan, you MUST get this documentary for your collection!",1243296000,,361,4.402985074626866
8328295,4,B001NY42LU,"The picture quality isn't excellent, but that's part of the appeal of this DVD.  Comprised largely of home movies and behind-the-scenes footage shot by B5's manager, this is the story of 5 brothers following their dream to become the young men they are today.  We see the transformation of young boys performing on small stages to a group with a major label deal and the potential to become a powerhouse in the music industry along with groups as memorable as B2K, New Edition, NSync and Backstreet Boys.  Fans also enjoy a look into their offstage lives doing things like snorkling, snowboarding and dirtbike riding.  Diehard B5 fans will enjoy this look into the lives and careers of the Breeding brothers, and older fans, moms, and new fans will appreciate their talent, work ethic, and the fact that they are genuinely likeable and warm young men.  Very enjoyable and very memorable.",1235779200,,887,4.886666666666667
8328296,3,B001NY42LU,"No doubt about it,I love my B5 boys and was very excited
when I recieved my copy of the dvd in the mail. although
I have to say that the camera footage wasn't all that great.
but in all I enjoyed seeing my boys blossom from cute little
boys to sexy,fine and very handsome young men. the dvd was
funny despite the camera action, it was worth the buy. that's
if you're truly a die hard fan. I would do any thing to support
my babies. B5 fan for life baby! ONE",1235606400,,457,3.9782608695652173
