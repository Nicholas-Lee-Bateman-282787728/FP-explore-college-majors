 Light, enteretaiing story, (adapted from The Last of Mrs. Cheney) very fun cast, especially the character acters of this era. FMI, See the other reviews, and IMDB site.",1531699200,,263,4.844444444444444

8662242,4,B00KWP6JZ8,"Was I not in the right mood? Certainly I'm a major Greer Garson fan, but though I enjoyed the movie I can't give it quite the ecstatic review that others have. it was nice, it was fun and Greer Garson was excellent, but it wasn't more than a pleasant entertainment for me and with this cast I couldn't help but feel it should have been even better.

This was a remake of The Last of Mrs. Cheyney, made twice before by MGM, once with Joan Crawfoed and earlier with Norma Shearer. at this point in time Greer Garson was considered past her prime by the studio and was not being given the full star treatment she deserved, and so she got a third time around script and an average black and white production at a time when studios were doing most everything but the most dark and serious films in color to lure the public away from their new televisions.

To its credit the script is witty and intelligently humorous in a way you would never find today and the cast does a good job with it. I couldn't help but feel that Greer Garson wasn't the best choice for this role. She was 47 at this time and the role of an adventuress really should have gone to a younger woman who would have possibly done such a thing. Garson also had made a career of playing strong women of the greatest integrity and decency so I had a very hard time seeing her as a con-artist. I know, it's probably just me, but when an actress of the Golden Age plays a certain kind of role consistently, it's hard to see her as anything else (and Hollywood encouraged this). The con itself was difficult to figure out and was never explained as movies usually do. How exactly do you cheat when the cards are in a locked box? Also. being Greer Garson, she's much more of a lady and a natural aristocrat than any other person in the film, perhaps too much for someone who had been in service, despite her saying she had eyes and ears. She even rode a horse brilliantly.

I know this is being a bit hard on a light entertainment, but I just never could see Garson as the character. The cast was good with Michael Wilding his usual good self in a comedy and Marjorie Main even better than she was in The Women. It's still all fun and worth watching. I was happy enough to find a Greer Garson movie I'd never seen or heard of. (I recommend Her Twelve Men if you can find it. She plays a kind of Mr. Chips character at a boys' school). Watch it, enjoy it, just don't expect Random Harvest or Mrs. Miniver.",1472860800,2,2462,4.245202558635395
8662243,5,B00KWP6JZ8,"What a wonderful surprise of a movie. I had never seen it before and it was a delight throughout. A frothy comedy with fantastic writing and performances by Greer Garson - with dark hair no less, TWO Michael Wildings and the irrepressible Marjorie Main. Main almost steals the movie!!
I recommend this as it is just a lot of fun watching Garson and Wilding romp around the world spinning their web. Throw in Fernando Lamas and it's and some rather sketchy relatives/friends and it's quite a romp.",1471564800,,496,4.712643678160919
