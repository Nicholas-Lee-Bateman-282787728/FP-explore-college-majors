8567333,2,B00BENWO42,"I either heavily misinterpreted what this movie was about, or the filmmaker has mislead us into thinking this is something it was not. I was looking for a movie regarding the history of London. This movie is more akin to a documentary regarding social movements and changes within London beginning in 1900 and moving to the present. I wanted something more toward London's history, beginnings, architecture, museums, underground, etc. Instead what I got was essentially a disjointed film about social movements and unrest within London.",1433721600,,536,5.317647058823529

8567337,4,B00BENWO42,"Most interesting. A little disturbing as I did not know a lot about LONDON. I have been there many times, but as a tourist, I was just looking at all the sights. Do read this book if you get a chance.",1382227200,,200,3.902439024390244
8567338,5,B00BENWO42,"I had no idea what to expect when I put this DVD into my player - the packaging doesn't tell you much. All I knew was it was a two-hour ""documentary"" produced, written and directed by Julian Temple  - best known for working on video projects with David Bowie and the Sex Pistols - produced by the BBC and the British Film Institute. But as I watched the TV screen for those two hours I was fascinated by what I saw and heard.  In advance of the excitement of the London Olympics, Temple delved deep into the film archives of the BFI and selected footage going back to 1900 and meshed it with some more modern images to tell the story of how London evolved over 113 years from a fully British city to a melding of cultures, with Jews, Asians and Indians arriving by the scores. He shows that this immigration influx had it's issues but eventually the city became truly ""international"" in nature. It seemed at every decade had its riots and these are shown too. There is no narrator, but none is needed. And, for the soundtrack, Temple used ""period"" recordings - 78s musical hall songs for the 19-teens and 20s, crooners for the 1930s and classic rock recordings (the Rolling Stones and, of course, the Clash's ""London Calling)"" for the later years. The list of song credits at the end goes on for a few minutes. (And don't miss the great footage of a monkey during the end credits - you'll understand when you see it!).

The film was nominated for a bunch of European film awards and I can see why.

The DVD includes a 6 minute ""conversation"" with Temple and the film's Trailer.

This DVD is well worth seeking out.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
