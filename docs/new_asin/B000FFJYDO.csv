as they appear prominently in 4 episodes. Also prominent is the only Care Bear Cousin I like. Treat Heart Pig is a real cutey who
also appears in 4 episodes,love her outfit in The Safety Game! This is an excellent set of stories. For those who collect Care Bear
DVDs this is a must. It is both entertaining and informative!",1294272000,,450,4.294117647058823
8121658,5,B000FFJYDO,"This is so far, the best collection of the Care Bears that I have seen. The seven stories on this disc are the ones I remember so well from my childhood. The seven episodes on the disc are:

Hearts at Sea: Grams tells a story of an adventurous young girl aboard a sailing ship.

Cheer Bear's Chance: Cheer Bear must prove herself when beastly and shreeky attack the S.S. Friendship.

A Hungry Little Guy: Beastly and Shreeky place a alien aboard the S.S. Friendship to create havoc among the Crew.

The Thing that came to Stay: A wild animal Cheer brings aboard the S.S. Friendship creates so much trouble that she soon learns animals should remain in the wild.

A day without Tugs: Tugs is sick and Hugs finds a new friend to play with, her shadow.

The Fabulous Care Bears Safety game: Grumpy hosts a new quiz game where contestants Hugs, Tugs, and Mr. Beastly tell us what they know about safety.

A Rhyme in Time: While Grams read the Cubs safety Rhymes, Hugs and Tugs daydream and act out they have heard.

I personally enjoyed each and every one of these episodes, but the ones I enjoyed the most had to be the 3 about the S.S friendship; but all of these episodes are great for children, (and everybody else too) the last two are great ways to teach your children safety. If you or your children enjoy the CareBears, definetly get this DVD collection, its worth it.",1180396800,3,1372,4.46
