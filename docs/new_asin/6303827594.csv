7854773,4,6303827594,"HABEAS CORPUS (1928) was technically Laurel & Hardy's first sound film, as Vitaphone audio discs of music and sound effects were added to what was originally a two-reel silent comedy (there was never any spoken dialogue on those discs). The short is presented here in its silent form.

This macabre story was directed by Leo McCarey and James Parrott (Charley Chase's brother). In it, the boys are hired by an oddball professor to perform ghoulish work: retrieve a body at night from a creepy graveyard. Most memorable here are several bumbling attempts to climb a cemetery wall and their fright at a drunk wrapped in a sheet.
