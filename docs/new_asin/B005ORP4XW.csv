8587024,5,B005ORP4XW,"As a former employee of a small, family-run airline, I found this a pretty accurate reflection of life in such an enterprise.  The battles with weather, equipment and personalities make the Ground Hog Day experience of doing the same flights each week into a new adventure each day.  I salute the courage of Buffalo Joe and the McBride family in sharing with viewers the ups and downs of their lives.  I also salute the managers, pilots and mechanics who keep these vintage aircraft in the air, doing useful work, fighting fires and feeding people of the Canadian north.  I can't imagine working my way through the rampie experience into the cockpit, and I especially admire the tenacity of the people who do.  The show provides a tremendous window into the struggle with difficult jobs and how some inspiring people manage to find the inner strength to cope.  The folks who produced this series did an amazing job with camera work on the planes, interviews with the staff and explanations of technical issues that underlie the drama.  With all the cold weather situations, not to mention great flying footage, this has to be the coolest show available on DVD.",1530230400,,1160,4.828282828282828
