7860673,1,6304079249,"""American Flatulators"" is a stunning cinematic achievement. Never has flatus and the accoutrements associated with the posterior been so celebrated. In a spoof of a popular 1990's television show, colonic expression is most highly prized. See Dumper Pile (a feminine former Marine from the Windy City) battle to the death with Gaseous Clay and Silent But Deadly. As for me, my money is on Tex ""Air Biscuit"" Fritter. (I made none of this up in case you were hoping against hope that this wasn't real.)

Don your gasmask for intestinal mayhem complete with repulsively relevant ""commercials"" for things like Flatu-Seltzer if you dare. ""American Flatulators"" is only available on VHS, and features the only contests I know of involving balloons of sulphorous emissions and toilet paper guns.

Repulsive at every level, not to mention boring.",1510876800,,838,5.2

7860675,3,6304079249,"The title of this movie should give you a pretty good idea of its content.  If you are easily offended, it is not for you.  Is it gross?  Yes.  Is it stupid?  Well, no more stupid than the program it parodies.  Is it funny and entertaining?  Yes.  There are several funny moments in it, and the takeoff on Marilyn Monroe's most famous scene is a winner.  There are no big-name actors or actresses in it, and it was probably fairly low-budget.  But I have seen much worse movies praised to the skies.  As I never liked American Gladiators, I found this burlesque of it to be on-target.  It's not  the world's greatest movie, but it's not as bad as most of the TV ""reality"" shows!",1341705600,,678,4.328
7860676,1,6304079249,"I found this video in the cheap bin for $4.00, and no wonder. I watched about 5 minutes of it and immediately took it out of the video player and threw it in the trash. Absolute garbage and not funny at all unless you  like the boring sound effects that gets old in a hurry. The only other  idiots who lost out on this movie besides me were the backers in the making  of it.",947808000,4,374,3.96
