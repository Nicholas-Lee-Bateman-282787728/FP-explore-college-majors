7480143,4,B016V3A7A2,Criminal Activities is not perfect. But it is a fast paced mob crime thriller with some young guys in over their head--except for the fact that it's not at all what most of them think. The twist is both sweet and painful to watch. Dan Stevens is outstanding as Noah. Jackie Earle Haley's first directorial effort is worth the look!,1448409600,16,331,4.533333333333333

7480162,3,B016V3A7A2,"Caught a glimpse of this film on TV, and wanted to see the complete film because I was intrigued by the scene in which a boy is saved  from having his ear cut off by the blast of a shotgun from the apartment below.  The boy grows up to be a gangster and rescues his benefactor from being tortured, but that's essentially it.  Neither the grown up boy nor the benefactor play important roles in the film.  No, the story is taken up by four guys having to deal with ways to come up with $200,000 that they have borrowed from a hood to invest in a stock that has become worthless.  Many complications occur, and plot twists occur by the dozen.  I had to replay the last scenes several times to see if I understood all that happened, and even then some mysteries remained.  Violence is par for the course in this kind of crime film, nothing all that remarkable or bloody.  It's maybe a bit too talky and certainly confusing with its improbabilities.  An O.K. time-filler, but nothing special.",1473033600,4,988,4.414364640883978

Not sure if it was a coincidence but there was a scene with some tough guys and a fifteen year old that reminded me WAY too much of a certain scene in Fight Club, to the point of bordering on plagiarism, but I'm willing to give the writer the benefit of the doubt even though it kind of made me twitch.",1466899200,,549,3.954954954954955

7480183,4,B016V3A7A2,"Criminal Activities is somewhere between comedy and mystery/crime.

The movie clearly is trying to blend both genres, as evident by certain characters such as Jackie Earle Haley who goes around uttering hilarious words and sharing stories to the people he's after.  The things he says to a 15-year old kid about forcing him to stay in school is really good writing, as is the story he shares when he was a kid about a divine intervention.  He had chicken pox and a drug user was threatening to cut his ear off, but by some miracle a kid in the apartment room below took a shotgun intended to use on a man having sex with his mom, but accidentally shot it upstairs killing the drug user and saving the kids life/ear, haha.  Jackie's the reason I'm giving this movie a high rating.

Otherwise the story is about John Travolta, who's a ""ruthless"" crime boss, forcing four younger college guys to work for him because of a risky investment.  Well actually the character of Dan Stevens got his friends involved in this mess promising them easy money, so now they ALL have to work for John Travolta as payback.  John wants them to kidnap Edi Gathegi's character because he's apparently involved in the kidnapping of John's niece in some way. Despite how serious this all sounds, there's clearly several elements of comedy throughout this movie.

My biggest issue with this movie is that it's a complete utter confusing mess.  The way these bad guys are all connected might make sense to mob movie lovers and followers, but for someone like me who only enjoys mob films on a much lesser scale and only follows them occasionally, I was *constantly* confused.  The events at the very end try to explain everyone's involvement in the story but unfortunately by that point I was so confused in all the sophisticated twists and turns that most of it went by without me understanding it.  The final minutes *does* reveal just how many elements of this story there are however.

Without spoiling anything major, turns out Edi's character is not who the college guys think he is, and his character is really good because he tries to get inside everyone's head as a way to encourage them to free Edi.  He's hilarious during a certain toilet scene, and the writing's really hilarious when the college guys all want ice cream so Dan's character goes out and buys ice cream for them, only to return with the wrong flavors or melted, haha!  Or how about the guy who was dropped on his head from many floors above?  He fell *right* on his head too!  The reaction from the men who dropped him is what makes this scene funny.  They're like ""Oops... what's wrong with you!""

Anyway when the writing tries to be serious, while the four college guys have Edi Gathegi taped to a chair, they often try to figure out how to get out of this mess.  This is a major part of the storyline.  The other element is Jackie Earle Haley going around trying to track down certain bad guys.  He's so hilarious that it's hard to take his actions seriously. Even when he shoots and kills people it comes off as a comedy movie because of his story sharing.  I was expecting an appearance by John's niece but that never happened.

Despite me not understanding most of the writing, I realize mob film lovers would probably love a movie like this, so I highly recommend it!  The comedy isn't frequent enough to interfere with the serious stuff at least, so for those who'd rather watch a serious mob movie will still get lots of enjoyment out of this.  The acting is solid, the writing has a lot of sophistication to it, the characters are all interesting (especially the reactions of the college guys and the mess they've gotten themselves into) so the movie is enjoyable overall.",1462838400,,3734,4.612708018154311

7480185,3,B016V3A7A2,"For the most part Criminal Activities is a pretty low budget looking, unrealistic character behaviour (well they act really dumb) style movie. We've got four young men not long out of high school who borrow $200 000 from the mob for a sure thing stock investment, that tanks. Now they owe $400 000 to the mob (Travolta), simply because he told them they do, but have been offered an alternative way to pay it back. Kidnap and hold captive a rival gangsta who will be exchanged for Travolta's niece who was previously kidnapped. These ""four musketeers"" clearly are not only out of their depth but don't know what they are doing at all. They talk to their captive a lot, and also without hiding their faces at all is the most obvious one. This could have been one of those what would you do if forced into this situation, but the characters just act too dumb to be experienced as that.

There is a little more going on to what you initially see but the ending is a little complicated in trying to be clever and to show us this cleverness in a minute or so. Criminal Activities is a watchable movie that will pass the time and has a few laughs, some intentional but some that aren't as well.",1461542400,,1188,4.4

7480200,4,B016V3A7A2,"If you can get past the 'f' word being half the script (which is why this only gets four stars from me), you gotta love this story of just desserts and a Marx Brothers version of intrigue.  (Was it an inside joke that the funeral was for someone named 'Matthew'?)  Our 'Matthew'-turned-'Noah', Dan Stevens, plays the brainiac nerd to a 'T', and those playing his peers make reasonably good foils - after all, they still pick on him, particularly the jealous, hot-headed 'Zack' (Michael Pitt).  Apparently thrown into a sticky situation, the 'Four Musketeers' have their mettle tested thereby.  Benign mobster Eddie (John Travolta) seems to leave one guessing, and why are the Feds catching up?  Just watch and see.  Watch and see.

  What do I say about this, it's a plagiarism patchwork that's unapologetic and sloppy, but still manages to be kind of fun due to the actors.

The movie is one part Suicide Kinds, one part Boondock flair, one part oceans 11, and all stupid. There are stolen quotes and scenarios everywhere, the plot is a Frankenstein abomination that will leave you trying to figure out where to start in unraveling all the poorly pilfered ideas and commentary, but Travolta is affable as always and by the time the credits role you wonder if you regret seeing the movie, and most likely settle on ""I could have wasted 4$ in a worse way.""

My wife laughed a bunch, said it was a good enough movie, I reminded myself the divorce papers in the safe are for emergency only. In the end her smiling made it all okay. I can't suggest this movie though, I just can't, it's terrible. If I could do it all over again I would have just watched something I'd already seen a hundred times for the sake of passing time.",1449792000,5,998,4.4021739130434785

I laughed i spite of myself at the total incompetence of the characters. The story was delightfully funny and full of great moments. I won't spoil it for you, but it's a success as an ironic comedy.

7480245,5,B016V3A7A2,"The film starts out with a funeral, followed by four of his buddies having a drink and smoking a doobie. Zach (Michael Pitt) is a portfolio manager and is engaged to Janie (Morgan Wolk). Noah (Dan Stevens) was the class geek. He was bullied and is still a bit socially awkward. Bryce (Rob Brown) has a hot stock tip. And Warren (Christopher Abbott) rounds out the foursome.

It starts out innocent enough as Noah was able to come up with the money for our foursome to invest in Bidexco stock.  As fate would have it the stock fails. Noah borrowed the money from the mob and Eddie (John Travolta) wants his money with interest. Clearly our guys don't have the money, so they reluctantly agree to kidnap Marques (Edi Gathegi) for Eddie so he can exchange for his kidnapped niece.

The film flows in a dark, quirky and sometimes twisty manner.  Then at the very end the film twists in multiple ways which frankly I didn't see coming.

Travolta looked like he is using Botox and his hair looked like it was plastic. Good crime/drama/thriller with some dark humor.
