3962617,3,B002ONC9XM,I loved Jason in Roswell and thought he was a great actor.  I wasn't as in to this movie.  I thought it could have been so much more but it wasn't,1347321600,2,146,3.6774193548387095
3962618,4,B002ONC9XM,"Lots going and didn't quite undertsand the purpose of the topless,nameless odels but overall a good film and not bias because I'm a Behr fan fro the Rosewell days!",1317168000,,163,4.655172413793103
3962619,3,B002ONC9XM,"I bought this Movie after seeing the trailer online, after looking for more Movies with Krysten Ritter (the best friend in Shes Out Of My League) she plays Ozzy a likable drug addict model in this Movie, ironically I just seen Whirly Girl 2 days ago with Monet Mazur a surprisingly good movie (the catalyst for all the drama in this movie), Jack Frost (Jason Behr) a writer nice guy living a charmed life in New York after once writing a book inspired by his childhood friend and love Carolina (Monet Mazur), who is getting married to his displeasure, falls into some self induced melodrama over his heart break, but gets it together with the help of a charming 11 year old neighbor Sophie (India Ennenga) who dispenses the wisdom of a mature adult (yeah we seen this character before in other movies).

The Last International Playboy dvd aspect ratio:1.77:1 stinks, but this movie has a good look visually, good music (I love the Dresden Dolls), If you can get over the believability factor, some good performances by India Ennenga (11 year old), Krysten Ritter (ozzy), Jason Behr (Jack Frost), Mike Landry (Scotch Evans) and Lucy Gordon (Kate Hardwick) in this case the acting was better than the material.

I never believed that a grown single man could have this type of relationship with a 11 year old girl who he isn't related to, who's parents never seem to be around, in this day and age of American heighten awareness of child predators, unfortunately true.

I never believed nice guy Jack Frost would be friends with Scotch Evans (Mike Landry) an obnoxious, chauvinist looser.

I can see how women would be attracted to Jack Frost, seemingly successful, good looking, nice guy, but not particularly charismatic enough to have 5 or so women romping around half naked in his bed.

Last, Its hard to be empathetic to Jack Frosts self induced melodrama when he leads such a charmed life.

This movie is like Prozac Nation for single men, ""boo hoo, I have it so hard"".",1294963200,2,1973,4.72093023255814
3962620,5,B002ONC9XM,"This film was named ""Frost"" at some point.  It's a beautiful gem of a movie in a low budget independent film style.  Illegal gorilla filming in New York City at its best.  Jason Behr gives a beautifully understated and charming performance in the role of the ultimate NYC playboy who spins into a self-destructive cycle after learning that his childhood love and best friend is engaged.  An old storyline that is given a completely fresh rewrite for this movie while avoiding the usual cliche ending.  An especially lovely and endearing performance by his 11-year-old neighbor Sophie (India Ennenga) while helping Jack Frost (Behr), who has been living a Peter Pan lifestyle for 7 years complete with Tinkerbell, overcome the nostalgia and excess that may sink him.  There were cultural and literary references, classic movie quotes that I loved, too.  If that's not enough to pique your interest, then the opening sex romp scene with naked models should do it.  Nothing offensive, just kind of joyful, playful.  Loved the film.",1275782400,4,1028,5.035502958579881
8376228,5,B002ONC9XM,"Of course, I'm a real fan of this artist, Jason Behr.  He tells a story very well.  I love his acting choices, as he becomes his character so convincingly.  Story was a very nice surprise, as Jack seemed to me, to find his self-worth in his relationships.  Whether he was helping someone who needed him, or they were helping him, he seemed to realize his value thru them; which I think is very important, and makes life great..  Film was beautifully shot.  All characters were wonderfully written and acted.  I felt the direction and editing were seamless, and wonderful!  Wonderful story, wonderful film.",1519171200,,605,4.805825242718447

8376230,1,B002ONC9XM,"I bought the movie, because Jason Behr was in it. I was curious if he was anything like his character on Roswell. It's a story that has been told time and time again. Player thinks that his first crush will wait for him forever. She meets someone else. He gets mad. The teenage girl in the movie I didn't understand. I constantly wondered where her parents were.",1490745600,,362,4.417910447761194

The idea behind things his character has to go through are heartwarming and endearing to Jason's trek in life.  WELL WORTH WATCHING!!!  jane a bailey",1356393600,,280,4.872340425531915
