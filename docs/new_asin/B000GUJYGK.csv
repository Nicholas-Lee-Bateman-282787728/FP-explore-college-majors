2619655,3,B000GUJYGK,We have all the DVD's up to and including season 5.  The first couple of seasons were the very best ones.  We love them all.  Keep them coming.,1168300800,,143,4.035714285714286

2619658,4,B000GUJYGK,"I was really looking forward for Season 5 to come out because I think the cast has settled into their roles and have really become seasoned actors by this time. One of their better seasons as far as I'm concerned, and I am happy to have the DVD's to watch regardless. Anyway, as my Season 5 arrived, I read the back, hoping they were just skimping on the written work, and when you pop in the DVD, the menu would have the extras.........NOPE! No Booper Reels, No fun extras to watch. I was quite dissapointed at the lack of extras, and being a '70s Show fan, I personally look for interesting tidbits that you wouldn't normally get on the everyday episodes. I'm hoping that they will make up for the blandness of this set with Season 6. Overall, glad to have it and watch it, but longed for the extras. Aren't we getting close to the 100th episode special? maybe they will have a LOT of extras on Season 6??? Maybe??? PLEASE??????",1164931200,,930,4.412790697674419
2619659,3,B000GUJYGK,"Season 5 is one of the best, so I was looking forward to some of those advertised extras - don't waste your time looking - they are not to be found. There is a dismal lack of any extras which is usually the reason to buy the DVD instead of just watching the umpteen reruns on TV.

At least the first few seasons that were released had commentary tracks (although David Trainer did not quite understand the point as all he discussed was the plot of the show we were watching - hello? we are watching the show - give us some backstory). The commentary provided by one of the producers was much more enlightening and interesting.

This season didn't have any commentary at all. Where are the outtakes, the extra scenes - anything? The ""interviews"" that they did include were short and not very interesting - would it have been so hard to show more of the obviously longer interviews? And why were there only 2? I suppose they kept the interviews from the other cast mates for the next seasons. The promos shouldn't even be considered as extras as we all try and avoid ads anyway - which is all they are. How hard would it be to round up the cast for interviews and insights or find some unused footage to add? If you are looking for any extra insights into the show or characters - don't spend your money.",1164844800,2,1302,4.3539094650205765

2619661,4,B000GUJYGK,"The show is great! I would give it 5 stars, but does anyone else's DVD's seem to have the pictures moving a lot faster than the sound? Like you can see their lips moving but the words catch up like a second later? Im not sure if its just mine and its kind of annoying if its all you can focus on!?",1161648000,,297,3.806451612903226
2619662,5,B000GUJYGK,"Season 5 of That '70s Show will be known well since this is the 1st season when they started to have Song titles in the episodes. The 5th season has episodes with Led Zepplin titles. NOTE: some of the episodes have alternative titles.

The writers must have changed, and I think it's a crime anyone got paid for writing this show after the 4th season.  The good writing was gone.  Fez is now a caricature and everything that comes out of his mouth is obscene but is supposed to be 'cute'.  In place of comedy that arose from the rich canvas of characters we had in the first 4 seasons, we had sexual 'jokes' that were not funny at all.  They were worked in at every opportunity.  I found the menopause side story sexist --- and they gave Kitty a drinking problem which was also supposed to be funny (it wasn't).  I started FF'ing through the episodes because I did still enjoy moments between Jackie and Hyde ---- maybe they had their own writers (!!)

2619704,5,B000GUJYGK,"Mill Creek Entertainment has re-released That '70s Show on DVD at a budget price.

==Packaging==
Season 5 of That '70s Show is spread across 3 DVDs in individual paper sleeves inside a cheap plastic case. I would recommend upgrading to a basic flip-tray case for about $2.

==Audio/Video==
The DVDs look and sound great. The presentation suffers a bit (I'd say 8.5-9/10) due to Mill Creek putting 8 or 9 episodes onto each disc, but it's not a deal breaker (for me, anyway).  This season's release is 100% proper 16:9 aspect ratio!

==Contents==
That '70s Show was actually filmed in 16:9 widescreen, but framed in 4:3 for broadcast. Mill Creek's DVD release of Season 5 contains all 25 episodes in true 16:9 transfers. (I've compared various episodes with episodes posted on Youtube and these are the proper aspect ratio, nothing is stretched or missing from the top).
Below is a list of episodes on each disc.

Disc 1
1. Going to California
2. I Can't Quit You Baby
3. What Is & What Should Never Be
4. Heartbreaker
5. Ramble On
6. Over The Hill & Far Away
7. Hot Dog
8. Thank You
9. Black Dog

Disc 2
10. The Grunge
11. The Girl I Love
12. Misty Mountain Hop
13. Your Time Is Gonna Come
14. Baby I'm Gonna Leave You
15. When The Levee Breaks
16. Whole Lotta Love
17. This Battle Of Evermore

Disc 3
18. Hey, Hey What Can I Do
19. Bring It On Home
20. No Quarter
21. Trampled Under Foot
22. You Shook Me
23. Nobody's Fault But Mine
24. Immigrant Song
25. Celebration Day
BONUS: 25 episode promos; A '70s Flashback: Interview with Wilmer Valderama; A '70s Flashback: An Interview with Danny Masterson; Season 5 Highlights

==Bonus Features==
Season 5 includes the above bonus features.  No audio commentaries this time.

==Bottom Line==
If you don't own the now-discontinued Season releases from years past, these re-releases are worth picking up. They're priced very inexpensively. The picture quality may not be as good as it could be (due to cramming so many episodes onto each disc), but this is a solid release. The proper widescreen transfer is a huge plus for me.",1351296000,2,2071,4.588075880758808

2619711,1,B000GUJYGK,"The picture and the real product DOES NOT MATCH... I found it very disappointing when it wasn't my first time and I learned my lesson. I had to do more work by asking each seller to see if this product has the older design with bigger cardboard box set with 4 slimmer plastic case, because it is what I want. I don't really want the only one newer, slimmer, and plastic DVD case that are recently made. It will not match with my older collection... Other than that, I m pretty sure that this product contains very same TV show and everything but not for me. Thanks.",1277078400,,565,4.289719626168225

This series is great and I would've given this product 5 stars, however I'm disappointed with the DVD packaging. I was expecting 4 dvd's per season, each of which packaged separately in it's nice slim dvd box. What I received is a one dvd box that contains all of the dvd's inside, which completely messes up the looks of my collection. So there you have it. 5 star product packaged into 3 star dvd box.",1269734400,,497,4.297872340425532

Donna and Eric got back together and Hyde and Jackie started dating (who would have thought they could be so cute as a couple!) and Kitty went through the change, menopause that is. I really enjoyed this season, wish I had Laura Prepon's gorgeous red hair. Jessica Simpson guests stars in a few episodes and Kelso's California fling, Annette. I highly recommend season five, happy viewing!",1205193600,,463,4.728395061728395

Jackie and Hyde's relationship is one of my favorite things about the series and this is where it really begins and it's just fantastic to watch. The humor is brilliant from every character, throughout the entire season, and Fez finally gets laid!! Haha. I totally recommend.",1199750400,,427,4.487179487179487

2619726,5,B000GUJYGK,"The season of Eric and Red.  I have watched this series from the start and can say that I think this season has some of the best lines/ interaction between Eric and Red.  You also have Kitty's ""lady parts problem"" and Shotsy the dog, Hyde vs. Kelso over Jackie, and the brief but memorable relationship between Fez and Nina.  As for the DVD's, there is not much in the way of extras, but if you enjoy the show this is something to get.",1174003200,7,435,4.216867469879518

2619729,5,B000GUJYGK,"The irony about ""That 70's Show"" is that it is about people that were teenagers in Wisconsin during the time when ""Happy Days"", another show about teenagers in Wisconsin during the 50's, was at the height of its popularity. For those of us that were teenagers in the 70's, there is a ""creepiness factor"" in the show when it comes to the realism of the popular culture being portrayed. The station wagons, the guys in silk wide-collar shirts, the clogs, the hair that is sprayed stiff and winged - it's all there. Plus it's great to see in this PC era, the non-PC-ness of the late 1970's portrayed so honestly. Parents don't run around in circles pulling out their hair when they discover that their kids might have had a beer, and the show is quite frank in portraying the occasional drug use that was very common among teens of that era.

As for this particular season, the show still hadn't run out of steam. There are some interesting plot lines - Kitty believing she is pregnant and then discovering she is wrong and that it is a whole different kind of beginning she is facing. Then there's the hilarious mismatched romance between Hyde and Jackie and the resulting triangle between those two and Kelso. Also, Eric and Donna finally come to the conclusion they're not ready for marriage, and the whole gang graduates. Plus, Fez has some unexpected adventures of his own. Also, Eric's sister Laurie returns. All in all, a very good season.",1170979200,2,1443,4.658823529411765

That 70's Show is able to avoid that problem with creative writing and some new, temporary charaters.
