3928488,5,B002HFWB3U,"This is an excellent movie that tells a mostly accurate story of John Smith, John Rolfe, and Pocahontas.  This version is 172 minutes which is too long, but if you're not in a hurry, it has some amazing footage to see.  The theatric version was 135 minutes, and there was a Director's Cut that was 150 minutes.",1472774400,,310,4.421052631578948
3928489,1,B002HFWB3U,"After watching the trailer, I expected more from this film. Based on the plot and the cast, one would have high hopes. Unfortunately, I left watching this film disappointed.

Based on the research, post production was the death of this film. The majority of the dialogue was cut, making the film heavily weighed on nature shots and soft-toned narration. Chris Plummer, actor who portrayed Captain Newport, ""vowed to never work with the director (Terrence Malick) again"" (IMDB). Although the style of the final film inspired projects, like The Revenant, the lack of dialogue fogged character development and made a confusing storyline.

On the positive side, I thought the actors selected for each role was perfect. Each one possesses talent and actually ""looked the role."" Plus, the idea to produce a dramazation of Pocahontas was also exciting and anticipated for. However, editing is what killed my fascination.

There are definitely mixed reviews on this film. My recommendation is for the buyer to first rent this film before buying. Of course, that should be the proper thing to do for any film. But, as a movie-fan, this is the first time I have ever purchased a movie spontaneously, and hated it. This is a prime example of ""never judge a book by its cover.""",1461974400,2,1265,4.9575471698113205
3928490,5,B002HFWB3U,"You know whether or not you like Terrence Malick films so I won't comment on that, but the Blu-Ray is gorgeous and works well. Some of the special features are nice but I have only watched a couple.",1457913600,,198,4.2368421052631575
3928491,3,B002HFWB3U,"I'm a big Malick fan, but this is not his best work for me. Too much of the swirling camera that is becoming his go-to style of cinematography in my opinion, but others may love it. That being said, compared to most directors' works this is still a great film!",1457308800,2,260,4.22

3928493,5,B002HFWB3U,"Hadn't seen it in theatres, which I now kick myself for, this is now my favorite Terence Malick film, beautiful and thoughtprovoking masterpiece. I believe in 50 years it will rise to the top 50 all time best classics.",1445472000,3,218,4.615384615384615

3928495,4,B002HFWB3U,Beautifully filmed! Loved the connection with nature and raw beauty of place and period which was enough to override lack of depth of character and frustration of fearful prejudices of period.,1433376000,,192,5.225806451612903
3928496,5,B002HFWB3U,"I'd seen this on one of the movie channels a year or so ago.  We just returned from a 4 day trip to Williamsburg, Jamestown and Yorktown. So I wanted to see it again with everything still fresh in mind.
Much of it was shot on location and there is a lot of detail that I overlooked before our trip, but it's all there. Some/much of the narrative is from the actual characters' Journals, or at least Smith's.  While it's Hollywood, not history, it does a pretty good job bringing history to life.
At 2 hours and 51 minutes the extended cut may make it a little long to watch in 1 setting.  That said, the first time I watched it won't be the last.",1433030400,5,646,4.152
3928497,5,B002HFWB3U,"This single disc Blu-Ray movie, arrived on time and intact, with no damage to either the disc or the case that the disc came in. Picture, sound and features playback is superb.

8370305,4,B002HFWB3U,"First off this movie is underrated and almost unheard of for a big blockbuster epic with big names. Farrel does an excellent job as John Smith, Bale comes in late in the movie around the third act and conclusion.

 The movie is filmed in a very different style and it's really hard to put into words but I found it visually stunning and a little surreal. Inner dialogs seem to be sometimes overlayed on a scene, so we hear what the characters are thinking as the action/story peogresses.

Highly recommend to anyone looking for something long and out of the ordinary Hollywood filming formula.",1517097600,,593,4.6826923076923075
8370306,4,B002HFWB3U,Great movie. Lots of good scenery. Good story line but little bit dragged out. But that being said i still enjoyed it.,1514764800,,118,4.409090909090909
8370307,5,B002HFWB3U,"Cinematography is stunning, acting is superb, script is at once an authentic and surreal account of contact with the new world.  The extended cut is just as good as the theatrical version; just a little more added here and there to scenes.  You really need Blu-ray and a large screen TV to appreciate this movie.",1513728000,,312,4.654545454545454
