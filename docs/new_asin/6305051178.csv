954462,4,6305051178,I purchased this DVD because of Ione Skye and the girls in prison required shower scene. Need I say more? ok,1392336000,,108,4.190476190476191
954463,4,6305051178,"Women's prison movies certainly don't appeal to all tastes, but if a fan of the genre , this one is fine.  Can never go wrong with Anne Heche!",1381536000,,142,4.071428571428571
954464,3,6305051178,"A slightly campy and cheesy made for Showtime movie that takes place in the 1950's when mostly white women went to prison. We initially see two women kill men and go to prison. One  (Bahni Turpin as Melba) used a hammer on a right wing news caster, and the other (Ione Skye as Carol Madison) was able to kill a man with a single blow to the head with a beer bottle. A third girl (Melissa Lahlitah Crider as Aggie) who goes to prison. She was framed and while it is a mystery as to who framed her and why, it is easy to figure out due to the lack of multiple suspects and only one motive.

The film includes the token prison doctor's exam, shower scene, fire hose, lesbians kissing, cat fight/riot, noir detective, and a really bad script.

Shower nudity (Ann Heche plus others)",1325289600,2,777,4.308219178082192
954465,1,6305051178,"I'm a fan of Anne Heche, but found this film weak and poorly done. Seemed to be a Roger Corman type film.",1261958400,,105,3.8181818181818183
954466,2,6305051178,"The Bottom Line:

It's not good as a spoof, it's certainly not good on its own merits, it doesn't offer enough sleaze to be campy fun (like, say, Prison Heat) and above all else it's just kind of boring--stay away from Girls in Prison at all costs.",1241481600,,248,4.276595744680851
954467,3,6305051178,"This is a women-in-prison movie with a slight twist in that it's a period movie.  It takes place during the 1950s, during the height of McCarthyism.  McCarthyism actually has an indirect role in the plot, in fact.

The story details 3 women who are given life sentences for murder.  Two are guilty while 1 was framed (Missy Crider).  Missy's character is a musician who has a song that just might be a ""hit"" (and it's actually a decent song, too!).  Anne Heche plays a sort of sadistic femme fatale who is out to claim rights to the song.

While some of the plot elements are rather contrived, this movie still has more depth to it than most women-in-prison films.  In fact, many times you don't even know what the women are locked up for!  Not so in this flick.  Whether more plot is good or bad in a WIP movie is something you need to decide for yourself.

There are two ubiquitous shower scenes, and that's all well & good.  Those are the only scenes where we get the obligatory nudity that's always featured in WIP films.  Anne Heche looks great minus her shirt, but we only get tantalizing angles of the stunning Missy Crider.  That's too bad.  Kudos to the writers for ensuring there were a few shower scenes, but they should not have underestimated their utility.

If you're into WIP films and / or the 1950s / McCarthyism, this movie might be up your alley.  The McCarthyism angle actually has a resurgence in  relevance these days with politicians being accused of having ties to terrorism.  Sadly, more witch hunts may be on the horizon.",1225238400,4,1547,4.5398550724637685
954468,2,6305051178,"Not too much to be said in a redeeming factor here. I think Ann Heche is a fabulous actor. I think shes even more cuter now, that she's 5 months pregnant..:)
However this movie, was a waste of my time and money. It had one or two shower scenes that lasted a few minutes. It had NO mean bully guards, that did awful things to the woman at night. Has prison reform really been this good.??
Listen rent it if your fan of Ann as I am, but save your money on buying it.",1009065600,13,464,3.9468085106382977
7881361,3,6305051178,This seems to be a spoof on the old B movies of the late 50' early 60's. The acting was a little stiff but the plot line was better than most,1517961600,,141,3.5806451612903225
