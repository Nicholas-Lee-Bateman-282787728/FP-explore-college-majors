8283414,5,B001BKVQ0Q,"Being a big fan of An Cafe.  I really like how this DVD is hosted by the lead singer MIKU.  But if your a fan of Visual-Kei, you'll definitely like this DVD.  The interview with the bands are great, I especially like that part when the band SMILE was eating at the sushi shop, it was pretty entertaining.",1236643200,,304,4.206896551724138

8283416,3,B001BKVQ0Q,"This one was not as good as the first one.  In fact, I skipped through most of it.  It is still worth buying as an introduction to some current JRock/Visual bands, but there is nothing memorable about it.",1235260800,,204,4.342105263157895
