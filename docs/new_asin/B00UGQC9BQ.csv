8706492,4,B00UGQC9BQ,"Come on, how many prime time horror series are there?  This was one of the last gasps of The Golden Age of Television. Ok, maybe thats a little too high praise, but from the solid scriptwriting and storylines, to the great rapport between McGavin and Oakland, to the best dramatic usage of special effects available at that time, on that budget, this is a true gem.  Managed to walk the fine line between creepy and campy like no television series before or after.  I remember recording the tv program onto cassette tape as a kid, and creating my very own first audiobooks.  They stood alone with the audio only very well.  Would have given it 5 stars if not for the cheapness of the DVDs.  Ive had to replace them once already, under no circumstances allow anything to be stacked on them.",1515888000,,789,4.52112676056338
8706493,3,B00UGQC9BQ,"Kolchak the Night Stalker, Season 1

Kolchak the Night Stalker was a newspaper reporter for the INS company in Chicago who investigated weird and mysterious stories that couldn't be printed. The humor was implicit in these horror stories, Carl Kolchak reported the facts as he saw them, although they strained credibility. The interplay between the employees was part of the humor, as was treating fantasy as reality. If you are amused by old horror movies from the 1930's you will like these. There were twenty episodes from the single 1974-75 TV season. The five DVD version is the better one to buy.
