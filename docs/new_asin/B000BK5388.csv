2420886,4,B000BK5388,"I have to agree with the other reviews, this was an interesting, well-crafted version of a fine Handel opera.  One negative in this production is the feel of the set and costumes--very dark and cold.  Perhaps this is a deliberate contrast to the warmth and passion of the music?  For me it didn't work.  However, the singing and acting overcame the stale, morbidity of the set.  Another small negative is that Romilda, played by Isabel Bayrakdarian was, at times, a bit shaky in her voice and not completely convincing with her character.  This is a small complaint considering Bayrakdarian did well enough and the rest of the cast is extraordinary, as other reviewers have noted.  I found the overall production impressive.  Would highly recommend it.",1190592000,6,752,4.96
2420887,5,B000BK5388,"Superb singing, acting, and conducting, a classic. It will be a long time before this production is exceeded on a musical level.  The settings and the costumes make reference to the turn of the 19th century Turkish Ottoman empire.  It works to an extent, although the gray and black tonalities have made the job of the costumer and set designer easier, they do not add anything to the musical work.  And if the sets and costumes are from 19th century Turkey then Serse is not Serse (4th century B.C. Persian) and this is disturbing also.  But there is grandeur (flags waving and triumphal entrance on baby elefant sculpture at the celebration of the battle victory scene)and elegance and interesting movement and certain stage conventions (love letters written on paper, etc. ) are made easier by setting the opera closer to our time.",1189987200,3,834,4.852112676056338
2420888,4,B000BK5388,"Baroque music has a fairly large and enthusiastic following. Anyone seeking to add a superlative Handel to their collection could not go wrong with this one. For those relatively new to clasical music in general and opera specifically,  you might have an adjustment phase to go through. Most of us have seen the period piece movie set in the opulent mansion with ladies in complex gowns doing the minuet with the handsome soldiers...all so regimented and ordered. Meaning, not a whole lot of spontaneity, nor are there any pratfalls, or the striking of awkward positions.

 There is but one actor/vocalist in this one who does preceisly that, for a little comic relief. It is Matteo Peirone who plays the affable, take a sip now and then, Elviro, valet to the jilted brother of Xerxes. He can actually sing quite well; but is required to disguise himself to deliver a letter, at risk of his life - and therefore- disguises his singing voice as well - in a not so melifluous timbre. I have to admire that. One could call it a bad career move; and  thus find oneself forever cast as a buffoon. Nonetheless, he does his part very well, and our hat is off to that devoted player who can take a bit part and do wonders with it. He reminded me over and over of the part of Dr. Dulcamara in the Alagna, Georghiu production of ""L'Elisir d'Amore"" by Donizetti. Handel's music is a generation before Donizetti's exhilirating melodic romps, so it is not fair to compare the two.

The opening score of Handel's Xerxes is just gorgeous. Our attention is immediately drawn to the conductor and the unsung heroes of opera, the musicians. The singers often have at least a break between long arias, but the musicians must work on and on. These do so wonderfully. It is quite amazing to hear what devoted musicians can do with a mere twelve tones. If they were not able to play so expressively , so impressively, I wonder if Baroque  music would have the enthusiastic following it has without them.

On now to the vocalists, who also pull some rabits out of the hat with a mere twelve tones also. It is explained in the liner notes that in those days ""castratti"" played the roles. We are no longer that barbaric, thank God, to require people to sacrifice their sex lives in order to perform drama with orchestral works. It explains further that if the parts were rewritten for a tenor, ""it just didn't come across the same"" - words to that effect. I remain unconvinced. It still makes you wonder. All that upper range just makes me hunger for the male voice. This then, is the reasoning behind casting male parts with female vocalists. To me, this was just so distracting, it was difficult to just enjoy the drama, the orchestra, and the singing.  Singing which was pyrotechnic, to be sure. The primary objet d'amore, Romilda, played by Isabel Bayrakdarian is a case in point. You certainly will find her as alluring as King Xerxes and his rival for her love, Xerxes own brother Arsamene, played by Ann Hallenberg-nor will you be disappointed with Isabel's acting and marvelous quality of voice. A woman two men could easily find themselves fighting over.

Patricia Bardon portrays for us the coquettish Atalanta, who schemes to tangle things up so she can take Xerxes brother away from her rival, Romilda - (the good looking sister). She does a fine and a cutely salacious job of that.

I save the best for last, the role of King Xerxes, and the American Paula Rasmussen who takes on the title role, including the enormous task of dressing, acting, and even striding like  'the man in charge'. But far more than that...her voice. Oh my gosh, her voice. When she does her musical soliloquy, you want to stop everything and just listen. Make a note of the scene number so you can return to it.

I bought this DVD solely on the strength of her performance in ""L'Viaggio a Reims"", the Gran Teatra Liceu production ( one of my top all time favourites, and if you don't have that one yet, you better act fast before it becomes out of reach price wise ). This is the most startling thing of all, I suppose. In L'Viaggio she is nothing less, nothing more, than The most comely and womanly thing on the planet. And my gosh, her voice. I think you will have to agree. In Viaggio, she does a trio with a lover 'wannabe', herself, and the fellow who has ""dibs on her"" so to speak...and all three take turns with a Rossini aria requiring all three to jump an octave again and again, and again. There, of course, you would hear clearly Paula Rasmussen's highly coveted mezzo soprano. Clear as a bell, and when need be, low as a foghorn, and high as a bosun's whistle. Just amazing. But the womanliness. My gosh, the womanliness of her. I can easily imagine her playing Carmen. Someone pour a bucket of cold water on me, please.

I suppose you can understand my difficulty with Paula as King Xerxes. She does a wonderful job. It is said that the violin was an attempt to come close to the human voice, and some violins are indeed, true wonders. But compared to Paula's voice?...it is nooooo contest. Breathtaking.

So please...no more casting of Paula as a male....this was interesting, and a keeper for that reason...but please...is nothing sacred? Look at her some time in a bathing suit ( vis L'viaggio a Reims ).

I have only one serious demerit to register with this production, and that would have to be the set design. Same Mr. Tomassi did the costumes, and they are par excellent - plus magnifique. But the set...oh dear God.

All black and white,(costumes also), all contemporary motif, all hard unyielding stone, all dark, and more foreboding than this libretto requires. If that were not bad enough... there's this ""Erector Set"" look to the cloyingly boring  grid of industrial strength- square  metal tubing all over the set, without relief for hours.  The "" Tree "" in the tale, demands center stage, and it too is a great blob of pewter slag, framed within , you guessed it, the same square tubing framework. A dark, almost black ""marble"" floor.

It just does not work.

For the love of God, please do these devoted musicians and vocalists a huge favor next time, and let them have some say so. This array of talent deserves better than to be framed in by scrap metal. Ye gods.",1161907200,8,6259,4.595515695067265
2420889,5,B000BK5388,"The plot (?) of this piece basically has everybody loving somebody doesn't love them except for one couple who love each other in secret. They fend off advances from another man who loves the secretly loved sister while the jealous and manipulative (but not really bad) sister does her best to split them up; she wants the man her sister is with. There's more but it's even more confusing.

Don't worry about it. This is a great production. The music is great, the staging is great and the singers are great.

It's impossible to pick the best singer from this ensemble. Isabel Bayrakdarian has a great voice, excellent technique and her performances are always tasteful. She gets to sing ""N men combe l'endre"", one of the loveliest arias in the entire opera. Anyone who's not moved by her rendition of this piece is probably already dead. Paula Rasmussen's voice has the lightest tonal shadings of the three mezzo-sopranos in the cast. Her voice is smooth, well controlled and mostly free of vibrato. Anne Hallenberg has a deeper pitch and sings with bell-like tones that resonate through the air. There's a considerable amount of vibrato in her voice but she controls it well. Patricia Bardon has a voice that's powerful and exceptionally deep. And she uses those shadings to convey emotion well. She is one of the standouts of the cast.

The two men in the cast are both bass baritones. Marcello Lippi's voice is deep and commanding but multi-faceted as well. He uses it to convey the thoughtful nature of a philosopher the warmth of a parent and the authority of a commander with equal aplomb. Matteo Peirone has a higher voice and silkier tones but plenty of range and volume. He provides most of the comic relief and he does it well.

Picking the best singer may be impossible but Sandrine Piau is clearly the best actress. It's not because any of the other cast members are weak. They're not. She's just that good. She's physically expressive enough to define her character clearly without dialogue or music. Her timing is fabulous and she plays the role with the glee kittens have when they find a new ball of wool. And her singing is as good as her acting. Her technique is breathtaking. She never sounds strained or shrill even in the most difficult passages. The music Handel wrote for the part of ""Atalanta"" is extremely demanding but Piau navigates the toughest passages with ease. She's a joy to watch and listen to.

There are plenty of highlights. Anne Hallenberg's rendition of ""Non so,se sia la sperme"" is fabulous. The duet between her and (Paula) Rasmussen, ""Io le dir che l'amo""/ ""Tu le dirai che l'ami"" is delivered brilliantly. Rasmussen's performance of ""Ombra mai fu"" is easily on par with the recent version released by Rene Fleming. Patricia Bardon rends the heart strings with her interpretation of ""Cagion son io mio dolore"" and Sandrine Piau shows how to handle vocal acrobatics the right way when she sings ""Dir, che amor per me"". The Sinfonia that opens the third act is three and a half minutes of pure enchantment. The list goes on ...

Christophe Rousset has emerged as a brilliant conductor. It shouldn't be a surprise though. His experience with this repertoire and his credentials as a harpsichordist make him a natural to take this step. His tempo is flexible but nothing ever seems rushed or slow. The balance he maintains between the singers and the orchestra is excellent and he knows when to pull back or add some force. Best of all, he's only going to get better.

The staging is set somewhere between the era of British Imperialism and what looks like a Puccini take on modern day Persia. The sets are extravagant, often bordering on garish but they never overpower the action. Most are glass (probably Plexiglass for safety reasons) or tile in a framework that's meant to look as if it's made of Stainless Steel. The tree set in the midst of most of them sits in a display case of similar design and material. They're colourful and loud but they provide an air of splendour that would be expected in the court of a Monarch. The sound is also good. It's not quite on par with the audio found on many concert DVD releases but it's clear and vibrant. And it's not burdened with the endless line of delay (artificial ambience that sounds as legitimate as a three dollar bill feels) that's finding its way to host of releases these days either. The menus are easy to navigate, the only quirk being that the subtitles have to be activated manually.

There are a few things that make suspension of belief difficult. Sandrine Piau and Isabel Bayrakdarian are never going to convince anybody they're from the same bloodline let alone the same parents. Patricia Bardon doesn't even begin to look like a man. This may be intentional (given the fact that Paula Rasmussen and Anne Hallenberg are entirely convincing) but she still should have to come across as ""masculine enough"" to fool the other cast members. She doesn't. She has too many voluptuously sexy curves that stand out like, well, voluptuously sexy curves. Last (but far from least), the ""instant resolution"" (so typical of Grand Opera once the Librettist and Composer run out of time and music) for the two and a half hours of muddled lust set to song strains credibility as much as the idea of Bayrakdarian and Piau being sisters.

But it opens the door for Isabel Bayrakdarian to sing a great piece of music to close the show with so all is forgiven. And it really is forgiven. The absurdities aside, this is a wonderfully entertaining performance. The story is silly. But the performances are engaging and the music is beautiful. It's great entertainment.

That's what really counts.",1151798400,30,5682,4.753549695740365
2420890,5,B000BK5388,"A hundred and forty minutes of sheer pleasure.

 Excelent singers, all seven singers are perfect both in  appearance and singing.

Perfect orchestra and conductor, not to mention handel's sublime music.",1142640000,10,202,5.633333333333334
2420891,5,B000BK5388,"In the past, to the degree that Handel's 'Serse' ('Xerxes') remained in the memory of the general music-lover, it was for its  opening aria, 'Ombra mai fu' (often simply called 'Handel's Largo' or 'The Largo from Xerxes') that it is remembered. But since the re-examination of Handel's operas of the last thirty years or so, the opera has become very popular, second only to 'Julius Caesar' in its number of mountings. And this one at the Semper Opera from the 2000 Dresden Music Festival is simply stunningly done. It is under the musical direction of Christophe Rousset, leading his 'Les Talens Lyriques' who together have received nothing but plaudits for their presentations of baroque opera. The orchestral playing is simply superb. And the cast! There is not single weak member among the seven principals. Rousset made the decision to have King Xerxes sung by a coloratura mezzo-soprano, the American Paula Rasmussen; the role had originally been written for and sung by the castrato Caffarelli. The two daughters of Xerxes's commanding general, Romilda and Atalanta, are sung by two of the leading young sopranos of our day, respectively Isabel Bayrakdarian and Sandrine Piau. Amastre, a young woman who had been previously jilted by Xerxes and now posing as a young man (don't ask!), is sung fervently by the Irish contralto Patricia Bardon. Xerxe's brother Arsamene, and his  contender for the hand of Romilda, is sung by  Swedish mezzo Ann Hallenberg.  (One is easily able to believe both Rasmussen and Hallenberg as male.) The only two male voices in the cast are Marcello Lippi as Ariodate, the general, and Matteo Peirone, as Arsamene's servant (and the primary comic character), Elviro.

The sets and costumes by Carlo Tommasi are gorgeous. The setting is done all in whites, blacks and grays, with occasional splashes of other muted colors. The superstructure for the first act (and for the finale) is an arrangement of huge metal-framed sliding glass panels - very striking - behind which can be seen a fantastic stylized plane tree - the object of Serse's opening love aria; possibly the only instance of a love song sung to a tree in all of opera. Stage business by Michael Hampe is uniformly interesting and often laugh-out-loud funny. He has made Xerxes's palace guard comic figures whose pomp is played for laughs.

Handel's score, for those of you who don't know it, is characterized by one gorgeous melody after another. Was there any other baroque opera composer whose melodies are so immediately memorable? Aside from 'Ombra mai fu,' (sung absolutely straight and all the funnier for it by Rasmussen) are Xerxes's fury arias 'Di tacere e di schernirmi' from Act I and 'Crude Furie degl'orridi abissi' in III as well as his duet with Amastre in II, 'Gran pena &egrave; gelosia.' Romilda, sung deliciously by Bayrakdarian, gets one of the greatest arias in her angry, comic 'Se l'idol mio rapir mi vuoi' from Act II. Sandrine Piau, one of the current queens (with good reason) of baroque opera, has a hilarious scena ('Un cenno leggiadretto') immediately following Romilda's just-mentioned aria in which she sings extraordinarily complicated (and spot-on) coloratura while getting dressed sexily before going out to vamp the king. I didn't know whether to laugh or applaud; I did both. (It doesn't hurt that Piau is a stunningly beautiful woman, as is Bayrakdarian.)

I had never seen a DVD of an opera Rousset had conducted before. Now I see what all the fuss has been about. He keeps things moving, is extraordinarily in synch with his singers, and gets pointed and glowingly lovely playing from his instrumentalists. From CDs I already knew he was a terrific harpsichordist (and he plays the continuo here).

I must say that seeing this DVD has done several things for me: it has made me a fan of several singers new to me, it has convinced me that Rousset is the real thing, and best of all it has made me watch a Handel opera straight through on DVD, something I'd never done before. I was transfixed throughout its entire 160 minutes.

8087570,5,B000BK5388,"This nitpicky old grouch truly enjoyed the heck out of this ""mild-modern"" production.  One cannot call it traditional, but it's certainly not 'euro-trash'.  It's nothing like Handel would have seen, but still, I can hardly believe he'd object.

I am hard-pressed to find a single weak link here, even including the tasteful updated production.  I did really love everything--the singing, orchestral playing, scenery, colors, stage direction, costumes, subtitles, everything.  The conducting and baroque instrumental work were especially exquisite.

I am afraid this is the new definitive Xerxes on video (or audio for that matter).  It blows the old English National Opera version out of the water, artistically and of course technologically.  (Alas however, no Lesley Garrett singing ""By Stealing Secret Kisses"" here!)  Oh speaking of which, note this is sung in Italian with English subtitles, whereas ENO's is sung in English without any subtitles however frightfully needed.  The point being, the casual viewer, such as myself, could sit thru the ENO video in English with no subtitles, and understand next to nothing.  Or, watch this in Italian with English subtitles and come away with a much better idea of what's going on.

Comparisons to ENO aside ... this is one of the most enjoyable operas I've seen on DVD.",1395273600,,1319,5.258373205741627

8087572,5,B000BK5388,This is an outstanding rendition of Handel's beautiful opera. The singing is top notch with a great lead performance by Paula Rasmussen as Xerses. The staging is very innovative and sure to please. Would love to have a CD version for the car.,1354924800,,242,4.651162790697675
8087573,4,B000BK5388,"This 2000 production of Handel's late comic opera, Serse, is very enjoyable and scores highly on several counts. The setting is in an indeterminate previous age but incorporates some modern props (umbrellas and clothing details) and humour (especially between a very funny Sandrine Piau and Romilda). As the story is one of complete fantasy it seems reasonable for the production to also have elements of fantasy about it. The colour scheme concentrates on monochrome only gradually introducing colour as the opera progresses and this is intended to tie in with the opera moving from dark to light.

The production benefits from fine authentic orchestral support conducted with proper Baroque insight by the experienced Christophe Rousset. This familiarity of style is apparent from the very beginning of the overture.

The comically competing roles of Atalanta and Romilda are excellently portrayed as well as being finely sung. This humour is vital to the success of the story and can be sampled in the sparring (tracks 19-20) between Atalanta, sung by Sandrine Piau, and Romilda, sung by Isabel Bayrakdarian. It would be hard to imagine this being done with more relish or accuracy than here. In particular, Sandrine Piau seems to be an absolutely natural comedienne and her performance here has considerable parallels with her amusing role of Wanda in Offenbach's Grande-Duchesse de Gerolstein. The other lightweight comic role of Arsamene's servant Elviro is also managed well by Matteo Peirone who keeps the humour from dragging and keeps the plot on the move.

The trouser roles of Serse (Paula Rasmussen) and Arsamene (Ann Hallenberg) are also as well sung as can be expected from such experienced singers. The supporting role of Ariodate is also satisfactory.

The non-singing roles of the servants are portrayed in a stiff and stylised manner but the crowd scenes/chorus are a little more animated. To be fair, Handel has given very little to any of these to do other than to be present and provide a backdrop to the main characters so it is difficult to imagine any alternative that would not be distracting to the focus on the main roles. Handel abandoned operas shortly after this and turned his attention to oratorios which proved to be an astute move.

The stage lighting in this production is often very contrasty, emphasising the largely monochrome colour scheme with resultant somewhat severe highlights competing with dark shadows. This caused problems of over-harsh and sharp imaging on the original TDK disc but the imaging has now been successfully re-processed by Euroarts and the problem has been greatly reduced to an acceptable level. The actual image shape is 4:3 which is not in itself impossible, but seems below expectations for the recorded year when a full screen image was becoming more the norm.

The sound is presented in good and clear DD 5.1 and stereo and is fine but with the following proviso: The opening aria (Serse) is impossibly loud if the orchestra's level is previously set normally for the overture. Curiously, by reducing the volume accordingly at this first aria point, from then onwards all is well! This was a feature of the original TDK issue and remains with this re-release on Euroarts.

I still find this an enjoyable recorded experience, largely because of the interplay between the comic characters and the other roles as appropriate. Sandrine Piau rather steals the show as Atalanta and this is reflected in the final curtain call applause. In summary this is a strongly sung and acted performance by the character roles and the production allows the comedy element to be genuinely amusing. The recording is good sonically but it is a shame that visually the imaging is a 4:3 although the small stage and limited lighting makes this far less obvious than it might have been.

My original review of the TDK disc reduced the basic 4 star grade to 3 because of processing problems leading to problems with contrasty imaging reproduction. The new Euroarts issue has resolved these processing problems so I suggest that reverting back to 4 stars is a fair level for the new improved Euroarts disc. For those not bothered by the technical considerations including the 4:3 format, a full 5 stars would be justified.",1341619200,,4267,5.051136363636363
8087574,5,B000BK5388,"The French baroque expert Christophe Rousset contributed much to the 21st century baroque operatic development.
In this performance in 2000, we can clearly understand what a great difference the performance of a revived baroque opera gets from being well-informed historically.
Like the Shakespearean plays, in Xerxes we have women in trouser-roles, woman in feigned trouser-roles. And to be historically accurate, Xerxes was played by a man singing in a woman's voice.
The main attraction, however, comes from the music itself. The pace was exceedingly well brought out by Rousset and his team of seasoned baroque experts, with a top flight team of vocal soloists to boot.
Ann Hallenberg, supposedly the second main 'male' character in the person os Arasmene, is a highly talented and technically astounding baroque mezzo-soprano. Her coloraturas puts Cecilia Bartoli to shame. And she is of great stage presence portraying the Prince Arasmene, the top enemy of Xerxes, King of Persia in terms of affections.
If Ann Hallenberg would fully justify the title role of Xerxes as not to allow any other choice, in utmost disbelief, we have Paula Rasmussen in the title role singing with such beauty and incredible dramatic nuances that one is left with nothing but jaw-dropping admiration. Her focused and rounded tone, plangent yet entirely lyrical, depicts a character not so much as brutally tyranical but suffering fully from narcistic regal superiority complex.
The three major dramatic scenes of Xerxes - the opening Act 1 narcisstic admiration of the 'tree', a symbol in this production; the Act 2 duet with Romilda where Xerxes struggles within in his narcisstic mindframe upon hearing that Romilda would rather die if Arasmene does not love her than to accept Xerxes; and the final Act breaking down outburst of fury and destruction of the symbol of his narcissm - the tree - were all rendered with flying colours.
The two sisters are also tremendous, if only one would swap Atalanta with Romilda, it would be sheer perfection.  As it is, the two sopranos are very fine in their respective roles.
The relatively minor but pivotal role of Amastre was played by Irish mezzo-soprano Patricia Bardon. Her near-contralto tone contrasts strikingly with Rasmussen and Hallenberg, and conjures a pathetic character that was being unjustly discarded.
The final pair of male soloists are nothing but buffo bass/bartiones at their very best.
This Dresden production is not visually grande, but dramatically it is concise and no-nonsense.
For the music alone this would deserve more than 5 stars.
A CD release should be seriously considered, too.",1325030400,2,2639,5.224056603773585
8087575,5,B000BK5388,"Let me confess that the cast, apart from the conductor Christophe Roussett and orchestra Les Talens Lyriques, is virtually unknown to me, though this performance was recorded in 2000:
Serse: Paula Rasmussen, American mezzo-soprano
Arsamene: Ann Hallenberg, Swedish mezzo-soprano
Amastre: Patricia Bardon, Irish mezzo-soprano
Ariodate: Marcello Lippi, Italian baritone
Romilda: Isabel Bayrakdarian, Canadian soprano
Atalante: Sandrine Piau, French soprano
Elviro: Matteo Peirone, Italian bass
Of the entire cast, Peirone and Lippi are veterans.  From North America, we have two lead singers in the respective roles of Serse and Romilda.
The entire cast is very even and highly effective, with Paula Rasmussen standing out in the title role of Serse.
If numerous singers: mezzos, baritones and countertenors alike, have attempted the opening aria 'Ombra Mai Fu', very few countertenors have attempted the entire role of Serse.  And it is easy to see why.
Rasmussen sung the title role heroically, and acted impeccably. Her timbre is full and sweet, and most importantly, possesses a real depth required of this role, and a keen sense of the baroque style.  The final Act and opening Act contrasts greatly in terms of temperament of which she managed with exceptional competence and beauty, and in the middle section, the duet between Serse and Romilda demands a dramatic pull off that Rasmussen tackles brilliantly. In this respect, predecessor Maureen Forrester really failed to score a higher mark owing to innate edginess in the timbre as well as an unidiomaticity in the baroque style, though the size of her voice is equally full and resonant.
As Serse's 'love', Canadian soprano Isabel Bayrakdarian is adequate, but lacks the vocal beauty to convince the audience that she is the person that charms Serse out of his senses (do compare Lucia Popp singing under the direction of Priestman in the early 1960's). The middle and lower range of her voice not being as well-balanced as her upper register.
Another outstanding portrayal comes from the Ann Hallenberg, portraying Arasmene, the brother of Serse and lover of Romilda. Hallenberg's timbre as not as suave as Rasmussen's, yet in terms of expressiveness and agility, she is fully on par.  Her Arasmene is totally convincing both vocally and dramatically.
Sandrine Piau should, as far as the performance here goes, be casted as Romilda for her vocal capability and acting skills.  As Atalanta, she upstages the heroine considerably both by her singing and stage presence.
The two male roles are very effectively tackled, and should under no circumstances be ignored.
Last but not the least, Roussett led a tremendously energised team of musicians, and his pacing is both musically alert and dramatically brilliant.
In short, this is a first class barqoue operatic performance.
A real shame that Paula Rasmussen has since became an attorney in USA and given up operatic performances",1324252800,,2937,5.30752688172043
8087576,1,B000BK5388,"The vocal virtuosity was extraordinary.  These people were extremely talented.  However the plot was tragic, very gloomy, dark, and dreary.  I'm new to operatic dvds as my experience has been only with classical music and operas on cds.  I was enchanted with Die Fledermaus and have watched it numerous times.  Serse depressed me and I'd never watch it again.  I much prefer comic opera - something light and amusing but with all the skill and vocal talent of the best.",1305158400,,469,4.8

It isn't period, or modern, exactly:  it's set in a kind of neverland where the costumes don't matter, and there's no big political message here, thank goodness (don't get me started on my DVD of Theodora that's an allegory about Richard Nixon).

Here it's just glorious music and singing, and if the plot is too complicated to bother trying to follow, it doesn't matter, because it's all about Handel and about wonderful voices. Everyone is terrific. Very highly recommended.",1247443200,3,670,4.859649122807017
8087578,5,B000BK5388,"... but all the wit goes into the music rather than the word play. Shakespeare and the sundry Italian librettists who wrote for Handel had the same roots in Italian Renaissance farces and commedia dell'arte. With the subtitles on the DVD, you'll suffer only moderate confusion, trying to keep the twists of the story straight, but it doesn't matter. Any sprightly acting or artful stagecraft is way secondary to the flow of glorious music, including some of Handel's finest arias and duets. In fact, the very first arioso by Serse is the famous ""ombra mai fu"", which you will find sung by everybody and her brother on YouTube, an excursion I heartily recommend.

In this performance, the role of Serse is sung superbly by soprano Paula Rasmussen, and her ""ombra mai fu"" is the most affectively perfect I've ever heard. Her acting in male drag is nearly as impressive; she's as narcissistic and willful a tyrant as the role requires. Arsamene, the tyrant's brother and rival in love, is a role of comical frustration and impotence, sung and acted ripely by Ann Hallenberg. The woman both brothers love is Romilda, sung richly by Isabel Bayrakdarian, but Imilda has a 'kid' sister, Atalanta, who is set on stealing Arsamene from her sister. Sandrine Piau, as Atalanta, fails to steal a lover but steals the show, acting with coy capricious vivacity and singing at a level few sopranos have ever reached. The smaller role of Amastre, sung by Patricia Bardon, is curious; Amastre is a woman, the rejected fiance of Serse, disguised until the final scene as a man. All of these roles were presumably sung, in the opera's opening in London in 1738, by imported 'castrati' from Italy. In terms of audience, Serse was a dud at the time, and for Handel its failure to earn money put an end to his efforts at promoting opera in England. The opera was first revived in Germany in 1924, and it has been staged more often than any other Handel opera except Giulio Cesare. It's the treasure vein of music that has drawn such attention, but the various attempts to produce it have run into a constant problem: the five principal roles MUST be sung in their original high ranges! Transposition to tenor or bass simply doesn't work musically.

Of the leading countertenors singing opera today, only Philippe Jaroussky could plausibly sing the agitated coloratura required in the arias of Serse. Conductor Cristophe Rousset has chosen the only musical solution by casting women in all five roles, a decision made possible today by the development of ""historical"" vocal technique. Five more 'convincing' and beautiful voices than Rasmussen, Hallenberg, Piau, Bayrakdarian, and Bardon have never shared a stage, I'd wager, not in the 18th or the 20th/21st Centuries! In terms of sheer vocal artistry, this Serse is arguably the best performance of an 18th C opera on DVD. Don't let the quibbles of previous reviewers deter you; this is a MUST hear&see production.",1244160000,5,2943,4.895791583166333

However, I was surprised to find that it did not satisfy me as completely as the old English National Opera production. Rousset conducts an absolutely gorgeous group of early music performers in which many of the string players hold their bows in the manner often preferred by early music proponents.  But the ENO production is almost half an hour longer which suggests that the Dresden performance has been cut...something that we don't expect in newer performances.  Oddly, though we tend to think of earlier performances as stodgy and conservative, ENO's performance is marginally stranger than the new one.
The humor in the Dresden is more heavy handed than at ENO so that the older performance seems to sprint along in spite of its greater length.

Both casts have much to recommend them but for me the ENO cast seems more in control of their roles.  Murray is hammier than Rasmussen but it is an asset in the role.  In spite of occasional shrillness in her voice, Masterson always charms me and I prefer her to Bayrakdarian.  Lesley Garrett is also charming and she but she has strong competition from Piau. Rigby's voice seems better suited to the cross dressing role than the Dresden mezzo for whom the role lies too low.  The king's brother is sung by a countertenor with ENO and its a toss up if you prefer a mezzo in the role.  I find HIM more effective than HER even though I don't really like the countertenor sound. The father of the two sisters is stronger with ENO as is the servant Elvino. The Dresden Elvino is too broadly comic and oafish.

I love Handel's music.  He was a remarkable melodist and his harmonies, particularily in his operatic scores, are wonderfully flexible and chromatic. He was much more ""modern"" than we think of if we only know things like the Water Music and the Messiah.  But his melodies are often subtle and elusive.  In the da capo arias it would be wonderful to hear the opening tunes again.  I feel that the current practice of embellishing the return has gone too far.  The da capos are often so distorted as to be unrecognizable.  This is more of a problem with Dresden than ENO and in many new performances it is becoming more of an annoyance than a delight.  One can only speculate on whether the practice in the Baroque was applied as much as it is today.

The big problems with the ENO performance are that it lacks subtitles and it is in English translation. I do not mind this although some of the words are missed when the singers go to their higher registers.  Human beings do not appear to have changed that much physically in the last few centuries so one wonders how much more understandable the lyrics would have been if the orchestras were tuning at a much lower pitch AND if the singers were not so pressured to develope volume to cope with larger concert venues and louder orchestras.

Of course the over riding problem with the ENO production is that it seems not to be currently available.  As a stop gap, the Dresden show will certainly be acceptable.",1199577600,4,3085,4.625688073394495
