8382508,4,B002VSFCKM,"Good movie. Makes one think about reincarnation and also what Heaven is like. Purchased this movie used and it does tend to ""stick"". Like it anyway.",1299456000,,148,4.730769230769231
8382509,5,B002VSFCKM,"I first saw this movie when I was 16 years old. It transformed me from a troubled, stupid, good for nothing teenager into a lifelong hopeless romantic. At 41 years old, I still seek my girl, ""made in heaven"" for me.",1295654400,,215,4.2682926829268295
8382510,5,B002VSFCKM,"I wonder why this film under rated all this time, of course this is not an A class film, but the cast was just fit, especially the cameo. Anyway, I hope this will on the blu-ray market very soon and satisfy for all who love this movie.",1271808000,,235,4.0212765957446805

It's a wonderful romance, but with several twists and some great cameos.

Here is the kicker - you can get this directly from Warner Brothers ([...] - look through their ""Archives"" ) for about 40% below (shipping was free when I ordered from [...]) the prices listed here.  They put up a disclaimer about not remastering the movie for dvd and you can view a sample clip to check out the video quality.  Looked good to me!

I didn't order the movie for the stunning dvd picture - I ordered it for the moving story and the awesome soundtrack - which will sound good through your stereo even without a 5.1 mix.

I've been on Amazons waiting list for notification if this ever comes up for sale - but received no notice of this.  I think WB is keeping it in house to maximize their own payoff for the costs of putting this out on dvd.  Not that I care - I'm just happy to be able to get the movie on dvd!

If you've been waiting for this movie - I wouldn't wait any longer - I doubt WB will ever go through the expense of remastering the picture and audio - so don't put off enjoying the movie.  If you've never seen the movie and you've read this far than go ahead and order it - you won't be disappointed.",1263513600,2,1251,4.153526970954357
