""Love Means... Bananas""

""Nothing to Crow About""
A killer tornado threatens the wagon train, but the only map that can lead the group to safety is missing... along with everyone's valuables.

""Wizard Of Ooze""
A bubbling volcano is mistaken for a mineral bath by the weary travelers, and amnesia prevents Dusty from warning them of the danger.",1235347200,2,903,5.25
