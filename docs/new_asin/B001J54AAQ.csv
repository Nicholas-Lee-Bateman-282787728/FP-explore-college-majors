8311922,4,B001J54AAQ,"""I Love Trash"" was fun and informative. The movie demystifies a phenomenon that deserves to be better understood by everybody, because it's happening all over North America and yet is hardly ever mentioned in the media. The movie is not an objective, ""detached"" documentary about dumpster-diving, but rather a first-person insight into the world of two people who decided to go all the way with living out of the trash... and the results are quite impressive.
Even as a confirmed dumpster-diver, I learned things about trash by watching this movie (why DO some places lock their dumpsters? How much time is gained or lost by dumpster-diving versus shopping?). While you can tell which side the filmmakers are on from the start, they are honest and inquisitive about the motives and ramifications of their and other dumpster-divers' choices, and raise many interesting questions.
As other reviewers mention, the film definitely has a ""do-it-yourself"" feel (they did it themselves!), which by no means means it's sloppy--you can tell that a lot of work went into it--, but I think it could move faster towards the end, and it did leave me with a couple of unanswered questions. Perhaps in the sequel?",1272326400,,1198,5.025125628140704
8311923,4,B001J54AAQ,"I was completely suprised by the fascination generated by this (very) independent documentary.  These two young gentleman supplied *all* their needs from dumpsters!  And lived quite well, at that.  As an object lesson on the waste in our culture, this film is a wonderful teaching tool.  I've screened I LOVE TRASH for a film group I host here in mid-America, and the entire group loved it.  Really opened some eyes.

The interviews are probing and direct without being overly didactic.  I LOVE TRASH itself is not only informative and well-directed in the main, but is also charming in a way that keeps the viewer drawn in.  It's a funny film! The narrators and the interviewees seem so well-meaning and idealistic that one almost feels a new faith in the future of our consumerist culture.  And you will *love* the fashion show!  And the ""garage sale"" at the end! A unique first effort from a couple of clever & insightful filmmakers.  Highly recommended.",1270512000,,957,4.845679012345679
8311924,4,B001J54AAQ,"Created in this day and age where anyone can pick up a camera and make a ""documentary"", I Love Trash whole-heartedly embraces the DIY aesthetic.  The sound, lighting and camera work have a home-made feel that fits perfectly with the central characters' promise: that everything they partake of will come from dumpsters.  While I doubt that their camera equipment came from the trash (although who knows? They find computer monitors, a full wardrobe and the like!) I do think that the innocent exuberance of their non-professional techniques serve to tie the film together as a whole.  Their espousal of the creed that anything one needs will be provided, if only one can remain open to the possibility that trash might not be dirty, broken or diseased but instead simply stuff that is ready to be reclaimed, is infectious in the best way, and leaves the audience with a broader view of life.  Even if you never climb into a dumpster after watching this movie, you will at least think twice before making assumptions about others who do-- and you'll certainly think about what you throw away.",1270425600,,1091,4.849462365591398
8311925,5,B001J54AAQ,"i Love Trash succeeds in that it offers a convincing and fascinating look into the world of dumpster diving. Yes, I did say convincing. I admit to being a bit squeamish about the concept of dumpster diving before the film, but the amazing success of their ""all-dumpster diet"" speaks to the efficacy of their ways. The defining moment for me came when they interview another diver about their dumpster diving hobby. ""Have you ever gotten sick from eating something out of the dumpster?"" he asks. ""No."" ""Have you ever gotten sick from eating at a restaurant?"" ""Yes,"" the subject replies.

Indeed, this movie reminds us that the idea of ""trash"" itself is something that should be questioned. Remember, the concept did not exist prior to civilization--in the natural world, waste to one organism is life to another. I Love Trash is evidence of this cycle repeating itself synthetically in humanity.",1270425600,,894,4.96
8311926,5,B001J54AAQ,"This movie is original, creative, and inspiring. The two people live in a way that most people would assume is impossible, and so their success is a message about how many ways a person can actually live that would also be called ""impossible"". I disagree with the other reviewer...they don't look unhealthy to me. They look like people who follow their own rules about appearance and hygiene. I came away from this movie with a smile and a renewed interest in living lightly on this planet, without sacrificing FUN! I have screened this movie at my school and it met with very positive responses.",1270166400,,596,4.740384615384615
8311927,4,B001J54AAQ,"I've seen this movie a number of times and it never fails to fascinate, titillate, and inspire me. The scope of the creators' experiment is astoundingly bold, and the results thereof are truly impressive. I haven't been able to walk past a dumpster since without giving it at least a little peek, and many of these casual glances have yielded unthinkable treasures. Sure, the production values are a little DIY, but I think that this fits with the overriding ethos of the piece and only added to my experience of it. A lighthearted perspective on the phenomenon of waste in our country from two people willing to dive right in and get a little bit dirty.",1270166400,2,654,4.646551724137931
8311928,1,B001J54AAQ,"This film is all the reason you'll ever need for not wanting to eat out of dumpsters. The principal characters look extremely unhealthy despite their youth. The cinematography, sound, script,and music seems to have been done by (not very bright)children. I want my money back!",1240099200,,276,5.155555555555556
