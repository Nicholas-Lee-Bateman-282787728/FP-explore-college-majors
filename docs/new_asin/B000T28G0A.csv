Episode 45 Zatch vs Bari
This episode is the continuation of the Zatch and Bari fight from Vol 11 and it's quite action packed

Episode 46 Ponygon's Close Call
In this one Ponygon thinks he found his book reader but there's a twist

Episode 47 Rumble in the Snow
This episode is very good it is a side adventure that focuses on Cherry and Brago (who is my favorite mamodo), but it also reveals a very interesting piece of information that has to do with the people on the cover of Vol 13

Episode 48 The Mystery of the Stone Tablets
This is the comic relief for this volume there's not a whole lot of it, but take it where you can get it",1364169600,,820,4.138364779874214
