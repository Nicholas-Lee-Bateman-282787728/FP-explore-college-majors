708245,4,6303651631,"This is an intimate, detailed look at a woman who feels depressed and alienated in her own marriage in the early 60's.  It's part of a genre of films released in the UK at that time that challenged the conservative establishment coming out of the 1950's. (""Look Back in Anger"", ""Saturday Night, Sunday Morning"").

In this case, it's the woman's turn, played magnificently by Anne Bancroft.  She plays the unfulfilled woman understatedly, but with the subtle nuances that made her a great actress.

For example, she gets a faraway, lost look that captures all that she feels she is missing, while talking to her psychiatrist, which he does not see.  When she snaps back, she is angry, completely inexplicable to the inept male pyschiatrist that can't understand her sorrow.

Anne Bancroft won the Best Actress Golden Globe and Cannes Film Festival awards for this role.  Although nominated, she lost the Academy Award to Julie Andrews in ""Mary Poppins"".

Being a big fan of ""The Graduate"" and Anne Bancroft, I can't help but to see the roots of Mrs. Robinson underneath this role, ready to burst out and turn to alcoholism and have an affair with ""The Graduate"" for fulfillment. If ""The Pumpkin Eater"" ever comes out on DVD, it would make a great double feature.

That said, the comparisons stop there.  This movie is completely different in tone with few, if any, laughs.  Harold Pinter wrote the screenplay, vs. Buck Henry who wrote ""The Graduate"", so that should give you some idea.  However, ""Pumpkin Eater' is an engrossing drama that draws you in with its great performances, and shows the repressed frustrations brewing just before the cultural revolution of the later 60's.  You can also catch a young Maggie Smith in a small role.",1198195200,2,1738,4.870748299319728
708246,5,6303651631,"This is my absolute favorite film of all time, and Anne Bancroft's performance is her best. Made in 1964 and set in London, this film tells the story of a woman who is in the middle of her third marriage, to a screenwriter, played by Peter Finch.  Her character, Jo Armitage, is a woman who truly seems to find her self-worth and happiness only when she is pregnant and raising children.  Once her children become even only slightly older, she seems to lose her sense of purpose, and allows herself to become quite isolated in the world.  Her current husband, the screenwriter, doesn't make matters any better for her either.

This is definitely Anne Bancroft's film all the way, and she is breathtakingly beautiful in it as well.  Her portrayal of Jo Armitage paints a very lonely, depressed, lost, and in many ways pathetic character...but it is also strangely my favorite performance of Bancroft.  Look also for wonderful supporting performances by James Mason and Maggie Smith.  This film weaves a disturbing yet very realistic portrait of a bad marriage (some might just say ""marriage""), and it should be studied for its acting and its writing.  In addition, Georges Delerue's musical score is superb, and I am always searching for the film's soundtrack, but have had no luck.  Thanks to beautiful art direction by Edward Marshall, their home interior is also gorgeous...'60's chic.  I've seen this film at least 60 times, and never tire of it.  It's a quiet little masterpiece.",1101686400,27,1483,4.892
708247,5,6303651631,"Ok, I am biased - she is my favorite actress but this performance explains why she was compared to Magnani!!! I have never been so moved by a film.  Perhaps the subject matter is dated but Bancroft, Finch, Mason , and Joyce make this film so great!  Anyone who has been in an unfaithful relationship can relate to this film!",1099180800,8,324,4.383333333333334
708248,5,6303651631,"Anne Bancroft, in an AA nominated performance, plays a twice-married mother of six. She divorces her second husband (played by Richard Johnson) and takes up with a highly successful screenwriter played by Peter Finch.  After the two marry, it is obvious that her philandering husband will never buckle down to her notions of marital fidelity.  This sometimes confusing, sometimes depressing film is elevated to screen art via once-in-a-lifetime performances by Bancroft, Finch and Mason.  As Jo Armitage, Ms Bancroft is magnificent: giving her role real depth, switching her moods with a wonderfully eerie believability.  Her breakdown in Harrod's Department Store isn't easily soon forgotten. In his supporting role of Bob Conway, James Mason is nothing short of excellent and Peter Finch excels as Jake.  This is a fine film which encompasses the joys and tragedies of life: birth and death, love and hate, marriage and divorce. The direction, slow and even-handed, allows the story to develop at its own pace, but gradually, the pace picks up as the story's intensity grows.  A fine and sensitive work & a truthful portrait of human foibles and complexities, these seem like real people on the screen instead of actors in a drama. A great example of fine sixties British cinema.",1045094400,61,1281,5.164251207729468
708249,4,6303651631,"Positive reviews of this film often refer to it as a melodrama.  It is more significant than that, being a largely successful attempt to create tragedy.  Deeply depressed by her husband's infidelity, the heroine, Jo, finds the priviledged lifestyle he affords her, devoid of spiritual value.  Her pregnancy becomes a pivotal moment in which she must seemingly choose between her core identity and belief, and an alternative offered by her husband. She makes her choice as if it were a pact with him, only to find herself betrayed.  The fight scene that follows is harrowing.  At the film's conclusion, in a gesture both exalted and grimly realistic, Jo accepts her husband's offer to continue their life together.
Thus we have the elements of tragedy:  success that is a fall from grace; Jo's dilemma at the time of her pregnancy; the tragic insight that allows Jo to reconnect with her husband, as he truly is.
I have rarely been so moved by a film.  Surely, this film is unsurpassed in its visual beauty.  The acting is uniformly great, and Bancroft delivers one of the touchstone performances in screen history.  The lyrical nature of the screen writing is enchanced, particularly in the opening and closing scenes, by the exalted music of Georges Delarue.  For me, this lyricism is also the essence of the Penelope Mortimer novel.
Final kudos though must go to Harold Pinter.  His style is peculiarly effective.  It is as if he writes half the scene, forcing the viewer through intuition and interpretation to supply the other half; for example, the scene with the psychiatrist.  This is a most intelligent way to engage the audience.  His treatment of the issue of abortion will probably not win him fans.  He demonstrates how politically correct and fashionable ideas can be used in perversely selfish ways.",999302400,39,1813,4.9372937293729375

Some likened the film to sludge, saying it was painfully slow, and describing Anne Bancroft's character as unrelatable, and alienating to the audience.  Others found beauty, and great depth in the characters and storyline mentioning particular scenes of Ms. Bancroft's as being the most memorable they had ever seen and worthy of her Academy Award nomination.

708444,4,6303651631,"The DVD arrived in the mail in a timely fashion and in good condition.
I had seen this film some time ago and remember how disturbed I was by the character played by Ann Bancroft. This film doesn't seem to be broadcast very often on TCM so I decided to purchase a used version.
She is a woman that keeps having children to try and disguise the fact that she can cannot communicate happily when alone with just her Spouse, sexually or otherwise.
Every man she marries eventually grows unhappy and leaves her or has affairs to fill in the gaps.
Ann Bancroft's character comes from money (it seems) when she visits her mother one afternoon to tell her the embarrassing truth...that she is pregnant AGAIN!
It's a complex and moody film so don't look for any ""filler"" scenes that take a break from the intensity.
Peter Finch, Maggie Smith, James Mason round out the cast....you can't get any better than that line-up.",1389571200,2,912,4.601226993865031

708446,3,6303651631,"As other respondants have perceptively noted, the acting is superb - from the principals to the supporting cast. Anne Bancroft and Peter Finch, via nuanced acting, perfectly express the anomie and even ennui of their characters without resorting to histrionics. Among the supporting cast, Maggie Smith, Cedric Hardwicke, and especially Yootha Joyce indelibly mark their regretfully brief scenes with memorable appearances.

However, the characterization of the protagonist, Bancroft's Jo Armitage, leaves much to be desired. Without very much dialogue, she is passive, enigmatic, and inarticulate. Her limited ability to verbally express her thoughts and attitudes results in a woman who, while obviously feeling deeply, is emotionally disassociative on screen. And she, thus, alienates the audience, as we cannot empathize and even sympathize with her plight - since as she is portrayed, we cannot get to know her at all.

Yet this film can be recommended - not only as a filmic icon, an avatar of the realistic British ""kitchen sink"" movie (those about class, emotional and financial unfulfillment, daily struggle), but also as a presentation of truly fine acting.",1375488000,2,1166,5.5083798882681565

708528,5,6303651631,"Seeing this film again, something like 35 years after I first saw it on TV, I was surprised how well it held up.  It comes from a time when it was perhaps fashionable to make more films for grown ups, and the characters here are not villains or heroes, just screwed up neurotic people banging around in a system that's not very responsive to their inner needs.  Performances are all excellent (including Maggie Smith in a small but important part).  It is a pretty depressing story, but not without comic relief, such as a great piece of business about going 'off liquids' as some kind of remedy for mental illness.",1368230400,,615,4.572727272727272

Viewed from 2012, this film was very ""sixties"" and very ""British"" but the performances by all involved were quite good, and including some pretty harrowing scenes. Others have summarized the plot, so I won't do that again, I'll just say that I'm wondering if they always write in a fight scene just for Ms. Bancroft.

708533,4,6303651631,"I watched ""The Pumpkin Eater,"" the oddly-named 1964 British drama starring Anne Bancroft and Peter Finch, cold one afternoon without a single expectation. While viewing the credits I noted Harold Pinter's name (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Complete-Works-Vol-1/dp/0802150969/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Complete Works, Vol. 1</a>) as the screenplay writer and immediately assumed I would see scenes of actors overcome by depression staring into space (I suffered through several Pinter plays in college). Sure enough, the opening scene has a depressed Bancroft sadly gazing from a window.

It's clear she's a well-to-do housewife estranged from her husband (Finch), lost within a stylish material world. She has a breakdown in the local department store and her past is revealed through flashbacks intertwined with psychiatric sessions. If this sounds morose, well, it is. Not particularly in a mood for this on a sunny day, I grudgingly marched on and discovered rewards en route. Foremost, Bancroft gives one of the great performances of an extraordinary career. Her work in the multi-dimensional role of the mysterious Jo Armitage not only received an Oscar nomination, but was awarded the Golden Globe and the Cannes Film Festival prize. I'm thrilled critics acknowledged her work in a film that could not possibly be made today. ""The Pumpkin Eater"" is anything but a Hollywood production.

To attempt to write a plot overview would require a feature-length article. Based on Penelope Mortimer's novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Pumpkin-Eater-Bloomsbury-Classics/dp/0747518874/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Pumpkin Eater (Bloomsbury Classics)</a>, the film details a woman obsessed with bearing children. She's the mother of eight kids overseeing a loud household ringing with broken dishes and blaring rock music (well, this was the year of The Beatles). Finch is her third husband, the first killed traumatically in World War II, the second (Richard Johnson) with whom she bore the majority of her brood while living a Bohemian life in a converted barn. As Jake Armitage, Finch is a struggling screenwriter when he first meets the lovely Jo and it's apparent they are attracted to one another. Far too abruptly, she's left her second husband and is pregnant with Jake's child. We are introduced to Jo's stodgy parents (Cedric Hardwicke, Rosalind Atkinson), an elderly pair repulsed by their daughter's fertile ways.

Finch's Jake is usually at wit's end with the kids while pecking away on a typewriter and there are signs he's a habitual philanderer. A very young Maggie Smith has an entertaining cameo as young houseguest Philpot who leaves in anger after an affair. Jake hits the jackpot as a writer and is traveling to exotic locales for on-location filming. Jake and Jo have dreams of converting an old lighthouse/windmill into a country home oddly within sight of the barn where she lived with her second husband. Jo becomes pregnant with a ninth child and has an abortion. Jake impregnates a star in one of his films, only to have her husband (James Mason in a nice cameo) reveal the affair to Jo in an ugly scene at the zoo.

Okay, if this all sounds melodramatic, that's because it is. Through emotional mountains and valleys, Bancroft forges a fascinating character. It's clear during her sessions with the psychiatrist (Eric Porter), the death of her first husband has caused her to obsessively give life. She has a strong physical attraction to Jake and while she dumped her second husband, remains essentially loyal during his affairs. When she is no longer able to bear children, there is a brilliant scene on a hospital bed when, with equal parts joy and misery, she embraces a new definition of womanhood.

""The Pumpkin Eater"" is heavy-going, and I was surprised by the glimmer of faded hope in the conclusion. I found Jo's acceptance to be brutally realistic, as we all must come to terms with an imperfect life. Is it sad? Absolutely, but also inspiring. Finch had a nice career playing refined characters during the 1960s (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Flight-of-the-Phoenix/dp/B00008MTVZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Flight of the Phoenix</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Far-from-the-Madding-Crowd/dp/B001B4VXWS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Far from the Madding Crowd</a>) before breaking out with one of the most memorable performances in history in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Network-Blu-ray/dp/B0033AI4CK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Network [Blu-ray</a>]. And then he was gone. Oh well, this is one of his most earnest portrayals.

Bancroft has always been one of the most captivating, if not beautiful, actresses. In a career stocked with wonderful performances (my favorite being&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/84-Charing-Cross-Road/dp/B00003CX8N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">84 Charing Cross Road</a>), it's a joy to discover one of her 2-3 greatest roles. The sporadic though exceptional British director Jack Clayton (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Innocents/dp/B0009X75EC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Innocents</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Something-Wicked-This-Way-Comes/dp/B0001I55U6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Something Wicked This Way Comes</a>) performs a difficult juggling act here. Pinter's screenplay is maddeningly subtle and Clayton, awash in the increasingly rebellious wave of the 1960s, takes on a Bergmanesque tone. He had his hands full with such an awkward narrative, and yet, he elicits brilliant moments of truth.

I'm not sure why these wonderful talents decided to forge ahead with this complicated work, though suspect the taboo themes of abortion and divorce were partially the inspiration. Earnest and thought-provoking, the film achieves what is today a rare level of satisfying art.",1301011200,,6101,6.27326968973747
708534,5,6303651631,"Two years after her Oscar-winning performance in The Miracle Worker Anne Bancroft selected this Harold Pinter script from a Penelope Mortimer novel, directed by Jack Clayton (also a very talented cinematographer). Bancroft plays a much married woman with eight children who takes a chance on Peter Finch. When he starts philandering she begins a nervous breakdown. It's not fun or uplifting but in the hands of these artists it is compelling and the acting is superb. The film also stars James Mason, the fabulous Maggie Smith (in two scenes, curiously unbilled), Cedric Hardwicke, Richard Johnson, Eric Porter and the inimitable Yootha Joyce (check out her scene in a beauty salon). Superior adult fare. Bancroft was nominated for her second Oscar but lost to Julie Andrews as Mary Poppins! Two more different performances cannot be imagined.",1288483200,5,843,5.2518518518518515
708535,2,6303651631,"What I find most depressing about this 1964 film is that it would seem to be an accurate portrayal of a situation that was probably considered believable at the time, as far as the concept of ""family"" is concerned. I was 22 years old when the movie was made and, in my youth, the grown-ups did their thing, and their children were treated as something like a necessary evil, to be dealt with by nannies or shipped off to boarding school. Even for people who couldn't afford those niceties, most families were not of the ""Father Knows Best"" or ""Leave It to Beaver"" variety. ""Children should be seen and not heard"" was more the philosophy of the day. This movie emphasizes that, with a woman who was considered more than a little bit unbalanced because she wanted to keep having more children all the time. Obviously, there was not sufficient communication and cooperation between the wife and husband about family size, etc., but that, too, seems to have been accepted as the norm for the day.

Contrast the whole concept of the story with the present day, with children being treated as an integral part of the family unit, even to the point of being consulted in family decisions. This story is a bleak look back into time. This is not to say that people today aren't cruel to each other, but I would hope that the woman would grow a backbone, take her kids, and get a big divorce settlement from the philandering jackass.",1287792000,,1423,4.580392156862745
708536,5,6303651631,"An intelligent and compelling British film looking at the problems that crop up when a marriage goes on the skids. Anne Bancroft, who is wonderful in the role, plays a woman in the middle of her third marriage who defines herself by having children. In spite of all her children she feels isolated, but so does husband number three, expertly played by Peter Finch. He feels his wife is simply a baby machine who cares more for bearing kids than she does for him. James Mason, Maggie Smith and Sir Cedric Hardwick all give great support to Bancroft and Finch, but make no mistake, this film belongs to Anne Bancroft and is probably her best performance. The fact that Harold Pinter, by then at the top of his game, wrote the screenplay certainly doesn't hurt, but it's still up to Bancroft to make the character more than simply work, but become unforgettable in the viewer's mind. He nervous breakdown in the middle of Harrods in London is one such unforgettable moment, as is the soul searching when confronting Jake on his affair with Smith. `Why did you marry me?' and `What should we do' suddenly become unanswerable due to the surrounding circumstances. We see things from Jake's view also; his desperation and feeling that he was driven into the arms of Smith by Bancroft's compulsion to define herself only as a pregnant mother.",1285545600,,1335,4.733905579399142
708537,5,6303651631,"In ""The Pumpkin Eater"", her first movie role after her triumphant Oscar winning recreation of her stage role in ""The Miracle Worker"", Anne Bancroft cemented her reputation as one of the finest actresses of the 1960's if not of the twentieth century.  Despite an Academy Award, it seemed that Hollywood was unable to provide her with the next screen role worthy of her talent, so she traveled to England to pursue this role.  Ms. Bancroft's instinct was right; both as a showcase for her versatility, and to stretch her acting muscles, Jo Armitage is the second in the trio of Anne Bancroft's greatest screen portrayals, the other two being Annie Sullivan in ""The Miracle Worker"" and Mrs. Robinson in ""The Graduate"".  Even though, she didn't get a second Oscar, she was nominated for Best Actress of 1964, and did win the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress, a Golden Globe, and a British Film Academy Award for this performance.

We first meet Jo, smartly dressed in hat and coat staring moodily out of the front window of her London home as if waiting for something or someone that is late in arriving.  Through flashbacks we get significant glimpses into her past, and clues to her current discontent. Jake Armitage (Peter Finch) is her third husband, and she has perhaps eight children from her marriages.  At first seemingly happy, they begin to drift apart, Jake overwhelmed and irritated by the large extended family that seems to immerse Jo.  A young female friend of Jake's, the oddly named Philpot, (Maggie Smith) stays temporarily with them & disrupts the household in more ways than one.  Jo becomes suspicious that Jake and Philpot have had an affair while under her roof, her mental condition begins to spiral downward climaxing in a nervous breakdown.  While recovering, she reluctantly undergoes analysis, which just seems to stoke her smoldering anger.  Jake has become an increasingly successful screenwriter, but their upward mobility continues to distance them from one another.  He travels to a movie location in Morocco, while she remains at home, feeling increasing isolated despite the brood of children,still questioning Jake's fidelity to her.  Soon after his return, Jo finds she is pregnant again, bowing to pressure from Jake, her doctor and her mother she undergoes a medically approved abortion and is rendered sterile. Shortly afterwards, as Jo is recovering her equilibrium, she is maliciously told by an aquaintance, Bob Conway, (James Mason) that Jake has been having an affair with Bob's actress wife Beth (Janine Gray), and has impregnated her.  This causes the badly strained marriage to finally rupture, and Jo and Jake must each decide if they can salvage their life together.

Although the title, taken from the old Mother Goose rhyme ""Peter, Peter, pumpkin eater, had a wife and couldn't keep her..."" would seem to point to Jake, this is Jo's story and Anne Bancroft rightly dominates the film.  She is extraordinary, beginning with a flawless upper class British accent, from this young actress born and raised in the Bronx, NY.  Jo is a very complicated, intense woman and Ms. Bancroft brings a dazzling range of emotions to the character.  Three memorable moments come to mind: the first towards the beginning of the film as Jo gazes sadly into the camera, her face a sculpted mask, we hear the ghostly sound of a woman's laughter, then on the right side of the screen suddenly appears another image of a younger Jo, radiant, her head thrown back in mirth, both images side by side like the famous comedy and tragedy masks in the theatre.  The second one is when Jo finally breaks down, standing alone in Harrod's Dept Store, her face contorted at first in soundless agony as tears slide silently down her cheeks, then the muffled sobs begin to escape her, getting progressively louder, becoming moans, very disturbing and unsettling.  The final image is just after Jo has learned of Beth's pregnancy, her flailing arm slams Jake's face in rage, and she is on him like one of the Furies from Greek mythology, consumed by the fires of anger and betrayal, drumming at him with her clenched fists.  Momentarily flung off, she pounces right back, not giving up or giving in, even as he begins to fight back, and her long pearl necklace catches and bursts, the pearls zinging around the room. This is one of the best fight scenes ever committed to film.  Harold Pinter's screenplay is rather sparse and lean, and I think Ms. Bancroft tries to fill in some of the blanks, making you feel the frustration and loneliness of this strong, intelligent woman who has no creative outlet for her energy and ability other than motherhood.  You want her Jo to have the happy ending she seems to deserve, whether she will remains to be seen.  In appearance, Ms. Bancroft never before or after looked as strikingly beautiful as she does in this film; the light coming thru the dark pools of her eyes, the sensual, beautifully shaped mouth, the winged cheekbones, the sleekly styled ebony black hair, clad primarily in elegant skirts that highlight very nicely shaped legs indeed.  In an early flashback with her hair pulled back, falling loosely to her shoulders, barefoot, in simple black sweater and Capri pants, laughing, surrounded by her throng of noisy children, she is naturally sexy, much more so than in her famous role as the predatory Mrs. Robinson.

A quintet of fine performers supports her.  Peter Finch as Jake excelled in playing affable, charming, amoral, middle-aged Englishmen.  James Mason etches the sliminess and spite of Bob Conway in acid.  As the slothful, gabby Philpot, a very young Maggie Smith comes quite close to stealing her scenes with Anne Bancroft. In a brief interlude Richard Johnson, as Giles, Jo's second husband, is wryly detached and perhaps still in love with her.  Finally in a small but effective cameo, Cedric Hardwicke is brusque and clipped as Jo's icy father.  There are also two bizarre, unnecessary turns provided by Yootha Joyce and Frank Singuineau that are quite puzzling.

Here, director Jack Clayton continued his winning streak in drawing marvelous performances out of his actors, as shown previously in ""Room at the Top"" and ""The Innocents"".  The somber black and white cinematography by Oswald Morris, the razor sharp film editing by James Clark and the melancholy score by Georges Delerue work together to perfectly complement the story.

Long after the movie is over Anne Bancroft's Jo will remain with you, and one that should be released in a restored DVD formant. It's unjust that many people will just remember Ms. Bancroft primarily for ""The Graduate"".  While her Mrs. Robinson is a marvelous performance, it  pales in comparison to ""The Miracle Worker"" and this one, finishing a distinct third.

7853197,3,6303651631,"I can't say I liked it and I am a great admirer of Pinter and Anne Bancroft. Bancroft seems miscast as a near-martyred earth mother married to a literary careerist. The characters are drawn truthfully enough but Pinter's time scheme where the story jumps around from place to place is overwrought. There are some fine secondary and cameo performances; James Mason but also character actors I was unfamiliar with like Yootha Joyce's searing madwoman at the hairdresser and Frank Singuineau's short but mesmerizing appearance as ""The King of Israel"". But those flourishes in the script and in performance are not enough to redeem a movie whose formal experiments progressively dilute interest in the characters rather than concentrate it.",1501891200,,736,5.245762711864407

an oasis, you say to yourself, ""What was that interminable confusion all about !"".

Wins: Leading Actress-Anne Bancroft and Black and White Costume Design.

Josephine (Jo) starts out a poor but respectable woman who lives in a barn with a large brood of children and a husband (Giles) who loves her.

However, that is not enough for her. She would much rather live in a large house and give her children fine clothes and the choicest of morsels, something she could never accomplish on her own due to the strict class system of 1960s England.

So she divorces her husband and marries a wealthy screenwriter Jake Armitage who lives in a prominent neighborhood. For a while she gets the fairy tale life she always dreamed of but it is not to last.

A homeless woman named Philpot boards with them for a month or so until she can find a steady job and a place of her own. One of Jos children claims he caught Jake catching her in a faint. Jo suspects him of adultery and confronts him. He admits he was attracted to Philpot but did not sleep with her.

Do you still want to? she asks.

Yes. he replies.

An awkward grin creeps across Jos face.

What? he asks. You think its funny, don't you--that I tell the truth for once. Im a normal man and Im perfectly capable of favoring someone else.

Jo hugs and kisses her husband and professes her love for him over and over but when they go to bed, she looks very worried.

Deep down, she knows her husband is shallow and selfish but she tells herself over and over (mentally) Ill MAKE him love me! Ill point him to his duties!

A year or so passes and the marriage grows colder and colder as Jo allows Jake to dictate one aspect of her life after the next, hence the nursery rhyme Peter Peter, Pumpkin Eater, had a wife but couldn't keep her. So he put her in a shell and there he kept her very well.

Jake wants to send her two eldest sons to boarding school because that was an accepted custom back then and he wants to show his friends how fashionable and up-to-date he is. Jo objects several times but in the end she relents. Later she muses regretfully to her psychiatrist they have been gone for two years and she hardly knows them.

Jake remarks to a doctor who examines her after a nervous breakdown I don't understand why she would snap like that. Theres nothing complicated about her life. All she does is sit in a corner and give birth.

Jo  announces a pregnancy to Jake but he demands an abortion saying he will give her his undivided attention if she does. She wants to keep the baby because raising children is one of the very few things that gives her any pleasure out of life. But she still suspects him of infidelity and wants his love and affection so badly so she allows him to squelch her further.

However she soon learns he is having an affair with Beth, an actress he was working with on a movie set and going back and forth from her and the other woman during her stay at the hospital and therefore her sacrifice was in vain.

This is the last straw. She flies into a fit of rage and attacks him with all ten fingernails and leaves him for a one night stand with her previous husband Giles to get back at him.

However next morning she wakes up feeling dirty and disgusting because she has allowed herself to stoop to Jakes level.
Oh how she hated herself for leaving her first husband for the sake of monetary gain. And oh how she hated herself for the little ghost inside her stomach that she will carry around for the rest of her life.

She goes up to the top of the lighthouse contemplating suicide but then Jake comes up the hill with all the children looking for her. Their fight two days ago struck just the right chord that made him see how greatly he had wronged her and she is touched by his well meant gesture.

The movie closes with him offering her a can of soda from the lunch basket. She accepts it with a smile and the credits roll.

The ending is not by any means to be interpreted as They live dysfunctionally but happily ever after but rather Well see.

Julie Andrews said in her autobiography she wished Anne Bancroft had won the Academy Award for Best Actress of 1964 instead of her for Mary Poppins. When I read this I knew I had to see The Pumpkin Eater because Mary Poppins is one of my favorite performances and if any actress could possibly have done better that year, she had better kick some butt.

Anne Bancrofts performance as Jo Armitage is so multi-layered, melancholy, desperate and painfully human that sometimes she doesnt even need to say anything--a gesture here and there is enough.

She is especially good in the beginning where she has the nervous breakdown in the grocery store and a stranger takes her home and even more powerful when she creeps down the stairs clutching the rails, listening to Jake talking to the doctor.

The doctor asks Is there anything going on in your marriage that might be related to this?

No. he casually replies. Everythings fine between us.

The close up of her face is priceless. You can tell she knows this is a big lie.

The shots of her coming home disheveled and tear stained and all the children on the doorstep wondering whats wrong with her just kicked me in the gut. A few years ago, my mother went through a stage like this and the way Anne Bancroft portrays Jo in the beginning is exactly how she acted. Fortunately, my father was much more understanding and supportive of her than Jake was.

Julie Andrews is an everlasting joy as Mary Poppins and her win is far from a disgrace but I would rather the Academy had waited until The Sound of Music to award her so both her and Bancroft could have won.

Peter Finchs performance is rather dull and flat at times but it works for his character. Jake is supposed to be cold and detached in contrast to the spooky, tremulous nature of Jo.

James Mason is much better as Bob Conway, the cuckolded husband of Beth, who seems gracious and gentlemanly at first but gradually shows his fangs to Jo. (both figuratively AND literally)

Also not to be missed a very young Maggie Smith as the syrupy simpering Philpott who constantly flatters Jo and Jake and makes you wonder whats she up to and a brilliant cameo from Yootha Joyce as the psychotic woman in the beauty parlor.

My favorite scenes are:

1. The shot at the beginning when Jo is wandering in the store which focuses on a bird cage. There is optical illusion that makes Jo look like shes in the cage too--a fitting analogy to her marriage.

2. The aforementioned scene in the beauty parlor with the crazy woman. She goes on and on about how beautiful Jo is and wonderful her life seems and how she wishes she get into her skin. Jo looks away thinking If she only knew...

3. The guy on the doorstep who said he was the King of Israel appointed by Yahweh, the eternal Lord God. At first, I thought he was just some lunatic on the streets. But then I wondered if there was a deeper meaning to this scene.
He says the people are unhappy because they give the gift of their love to unworthy men and women which is what she has been doing--vying for a love and affection from Jake that never existed--and he aims to build a radio station in Jerusalem so that the word of God may travel throughout the world.

Then she gets a call from Bob Conway saying he will make Beth pay for her infidelity. Slowly she puts the phone down because she can't stand his verbal venom anymore. The homeless man says ""You will be blessed for this.""

Could this man have been an angel she entertained 'unaware?'

Or maybe he truly was the King of Israel--Jesus in disguise come to lift Jo's spirits so she wouldn't lose heart because she is like the woman at the well--beaten down by life due to her troubled marriages--and since she 'did it unto the least of these' by giving him some money (the cup of water) she will be blessed for it.

In other words, even though Jo's life is a mess, she is not without hope.

Yes, The Pumpkin Eater is a soap opera but soapy in a good way and a great exploration of a troubled marriage that will make you question the duties of a husband and wife and ultimately, the definition of true worth and value.",1463443200,,8260,4.403024326101249
