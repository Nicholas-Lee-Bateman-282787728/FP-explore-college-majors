4481915,1,B004V6AISS,"Only one star, but keep about five or six Advil handy.  That ought to be enough to cover you for this one.

A couple of tid-bits about this disaster:

1.  It's made by Uwe Boll, helmer of two of the WORST movies I've ever seen in 'House of the Dead' and 'Alone in the Dark.'

2.  In what (to me) was a staggering moment of brutal honesty, Boll himself admitted that he didn't cast the movie until TWO WEEKS before filming began.  What he wound up with are a bunch of ""names"" that happened to have a hole in their schedule and showed up for a quick paycheck and a free trip to Romania.  It shows too, the whole film feels like they just totally skipped rehersal and nobody looks even half-interested in making an honest effort.

3.  Will Sanderson and Michael Madsen may have discovered the only way to survive a Boll film.  They were reportly completely drunk through the whole production.

4.  Ben Kingsley, who previously had to deal with Madsen on the film 'Species' refused to even be on the same set with him.

5.  In the harem scene with Meatloaf, those are HONEST TO GOD, 100% FULL-BLOODED ROMANIAN PROSTITUTES.  I swear you can't make this stuff up.  Apparently, Boll couldn't afford real actresses (their union rates made them too expensive), so he decided he could cut costs by just ordering-out for the real thing.

This is a disaster from front to back.  I'll give it this though, it's better then his last two films.  'Bloodrayne', at least, is a little bit unintentionally funny.  Even having said that though, I could never recommend anyone ever see this.  It'll only encourage the man to keep going.

Uwe Boll, without a doubt in my mind, is the most talentless film-maker I've ever seen.  I'm absolutely astonished that this guy keeps finding his way behind a camera ...",1136505600,293,1787,4.547169811320755

The fight scenes in this are great, from hand to hand combat, to swords, to cross bows and knives. Probably the best part of this movie is the twist and turns, enemies become allies and allies become enemies. And just in case you don't know anything about BloodRayne tis is not just another vampire movie.

4481941,1,B004V6AISS,"Yes, I was aware of Uwe Boll's (well deserved) reputation for bad filmmaking. But it's been many years since I suffered through one of his films. And since BLOODRAYNE had vampires, the sexy Michelle Rodriguez,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Meat-Loaf/dp/B000056VJ7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Meat Loaf</a>&nbsp;(my favorite singer), and Michael Madsen (pretty good in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Species/dp/0792833244/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Species</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frankenstein/dp/B000A6T1YA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frankenstein</a>), and since I was able to buy a used copy on Amazon for only one penny, I gave it a shot.

I thought, how bad could it be?

Pretty bad.

Part of the trouble is that BLOODRAYNE is based on a video game. Not being a gamer, I didn't know that, though I knew that Boll specializes in video game films.

Films based on video games are typically stiflingly dull, because there's nothing substantive in a game to base a film on. No deep stories or fully-fleshed characters. Nothing but a series of colorful, but soulless, combat situations.

BLOODRAYNE is mostly just a series of battles. Lots of CGI effects. Tons of hacked limbs and torsos. Gushers of blood spurting from wounded warriors. Countless faces transforming into vampires. But there's so much of it, and the ""characters"" are so thinly written, that pretty soon all this combat becomes mind-numbingly repetitive to watch.

Michelle Rogriguez does a dreadful accent. I think it's supposed to be Old English, sort of. It's an inconsistent accent, coming and going. Nobody else in BLOODRAYNE has her accent.

Accents are as inconsistent as the costuming. Meat Loaf has a sort of 18th century French wig, whereas other characters are dressed in medieval garb, or ancient barbarian garb, or even what looks like a 19th century, braided, Chinese ponytail.

Meat Loaf has very little screen time. So too Rodriguez. Neither is the star.

Characterization in this film is non-existent. Key characters die, but I felt zero empathy or poignancy. I guess it's similar to the lack of feeling one has when a video game character dies. Really, the actors in this film are more game icons -- avatars? -- than characters.

So I watched BLOODRAYNE's avatars chop and hack and slaughter their way from level to level, until the final battle ended.

Game over.

I stirred myself awake and shut off the TV.",1378857600,,2543,5.861788617886178

4481944,2,B004V6AISS,"Female vampire in tights, lots of sword-fighting, medieval setting of castles, magical talismans; sounds like all the makings of a potential blockbuster, or a potential bust.  In this case it was the latter.  The lead actress Kristina Lokken made her Hollywood debut in Arnold's final Terminator movie, and then disappeared from the big screen until this feature came along with her playing the titular character BloodRayne.  As a half vampire - half human girl, she joins forces with other vampire hunters to vanquish her father.  The movie's cast is decent enough, however the scriptwriters for this film must have been stoned or drunk; as the script is horrible.  The dialogue is cheesy, the action scenes look overly choreographed, and the acting is bland.  The special effects were below par for something filmed in the 21st century, and being based loosely in some exotic locale, the cinematography was dull.

There are some pretty cool fight scenes, and some pretty hot scenes, but the movie fails to deliver a very memorable experience. This movie is just about boobs and beat downs.

4481949,4,B004V6AISS,"Even though I thought it would be good I avoided it based on all the hate for the director.

Anyway they had all 3 on streaming for netflix so I just finished watching the 1st one.

Thought it was pretty good.  Good story, locations, special effects, and gory battle scenes.

Not sure what all the complaints are about.

The only minus I saw was the dialog was a little flat.  Not sure if you can blame the director for that.
Anyway Kristina Loken is very pretty and can do some decent acting it just seemed that her and Michael Madsen's dialog was a little flat.  However her acting and fight choreography was pretty good.

Gonna watch the next one later.  It always sounded good to me a vampire western.

Anyway if you want to see Kristina Loken becoming a better actress check out the painkiller jane series.

It's awesome from start to finish. Kristanna Loken looks exactly like Rayne. Lots of action, Blood, some sex, Thats what the games are so it did not dissapoint. The only thing, it should have been longer. It's a great horror half human half vampire movie. On a HD tv it looks even better. Bloodrayne dvd usually is pretty cheap. I highly recommend it.

Rayne is half-vampire half-human with the abilities of both that she uses to combat her father and his vampire army. Rayne meets up with some resistance fighters that help her out in her journey. There is plenty of blood,gore,and some nudity that will please any fan. Rayne has a sex scene where she has her way with one of the resistance fighters against the cell bars and she shows some of the best cleavege you will ever see. The special effects are lacking to where I can see people making this a B movie,but if you are a true fan you will take the good with the bad and love seeing Rayne slicing vampires into body parts while looking stunning in a black&red leather outfit that is as realistic as the video game.

4481956,1,B004V6AISS,"Uwe Boll does it again!  As if you thought some movies hit rock bottom in theatres, Uwe surprises you and shows you how bad movies can really be!

Bloodrayne follows a young vampire who's very upset with her father and wants to kill him.  After  hunting for what has seemed the most horrendous 24 hours of her life because she was forced to star in this mad pot of monkey poop, she finally does it.

Now, I'm sure you're asking, where does this movie go wrong?  The REAL question you should be asking is where does this movie go right?

First of all, let's discuss the acting and how wonderfully horrid it is.  If you were to gather several stoned teenagers and stick popsicles down their pants, you would probably get better acting experience than in this movie.  Talking in monotone, actors who clearly didn't want to be there, spitting their lines out as if they were all hungover and just wanted this endless nightmare of a production to end sounds more like it.

What Uwe Boll likes to do is make these awesomely intense war scenes filled with gore, and guts, and more gore, and more war, and then some more gore!  He also likes to drag these out for at least 1/3 of the movie, giving you a pointless slaughter spree of broken red hoses and gutsy mannequins.  As you continually watch the endless craze of a blatantly overdone violence escapade, you get introduced to new characters who appear drunk and running from the cops, spewing lines that make even the most witless person seem like a genius.

After all the ""fun"" we've had watching actors and actresses bumble across the set as if they're drugged and lost in a house of mirrors, we get to the awesome finale where right as Rayne destroys the main bad guy, she has the decency to relive the entire film through her own eyes.  That's right ladies and gentlemen, you get to watch this movie twice!  Except the second time around is only about 5 minutes, if only it were that long from the start.

So, if you enjoy terrible acting, overdone violence scenes, and having to relive this epic nightmare twice, than Bloodrayne is for you!  However, if you're like most sane Americans, then you'd probably avoid this movie like an obese man avoids celery.",1314144000,,2208,4.549367088607595
4481957,2,B004V6AISS,"Long ago in Romania, there lived demons and vampires who would terroize villagers and city folks. A circus freak who is both sexy and vibrant named Rayne (Kristinna Lokken) who's half-human half-vampire escapes from a Serbian carnival armed with two blades on her arms for protection. She gets a fortune about her past including how the still alive and powerful vampire lord Kagen (Ben Kingsley) is her father as she goes on a quest to destroy him with the help Vladmire (Michael Madsen) and Sabastian (Matt Davis).

A poorly done mess of a movie! Infamous filmmaker Uwe Boll has struck again with an adaptation of a great video game gone to waste. After two clunkers like ""House of the Dead"" and ""Alone in The Dark"", you think he would be finished then he made ""Bloodrayne"" which feels like a parody of the games than being a true adaptation. What is bad is the acting is pitiful but Lokken was quite sexy for the title role, some of the action is weak as hell including some of the camera movements and the writing is pathetic but on the bright side there is some brutal scenes of gore but it can't help this stinkburger.

While she does look the part as Rayne, she didn't convey the part in the movie; I never played any of the ""Bloodrayne"" games, but I know the lead character wasn't boring.  The actress didn't bother to emote whenever she speaks, whenever she performs, or whenever she stands perfectly still with her cleavage hang out.  It's rather difficult to get involved with her plight since she simply walks across straight lines while reading them, and she's not the only performer at fault.  The other actors are blisslessly underperformed; I expected such quality in Michael Madson, who's an incongruous addition among the cast alongside Michelle Rodriguez, but not even Ben Kingsley gave it his best as the antagonist named Kagan.  Such light-handedness could be blamed by the poor script, which has characters deliver corny or awkward lines like, 'Kill her; let find the Eye or let her try, then kill her'.  Thanks, Boll.

""Bloodrayne"" is a dull movie to sit through.  It holds nothing back on the extreme gore and nudity, and it does have pretty nice locations, but this is a lifeless movie.  None of the characters have any depth to them and they don't really matter in the long run, and some of the plotlines that occur are irrelevant; plus, it had a pointless montage at the end of the movie.  It's hard to really hate this movie like I should in a Boll movie, but in this case, nothing about this movie really matters.

I actually threw up after watching 20 minutes of this crap! Not only does it NOT have anything close to a linear plot line, the acting was completely aweful. The actors made it seem like they had 4 lines they needed to memorize and the rest was improve, plus the actors made it seem like they ran out of ideas and decide to fornicate to fill in scenes. after so long I literally had to get up and puke...I barely made it to the bathroom that's how bad it was.

Yes Uwe's House of the Dead was a particularity stupid film. I hated it too. But Uwe knows how to point his camera in the general direction of the action and keep the action at a pace that holds ones interest.

BloodRayne is a surprisingly enjoyable genre romp. Yes all the individual criticisms at the film from the bizarre choices in hair pieces and costumes to the silly dialogue are true. But c'mon it's a video game/vampire movie. Really how high are ones expectations going in? For a video game movie it isn't half bad. (Its tons better than say Doom, not as tightly put together as say Resident Evil) Uwe brings a refreshing European sensibility to sex and violence in the movie (In other words plenty of gratuitous nudity and violence). He also makes good use of the Romanian landscape bringing an almost Peter Jackson feel to the proceedings.

Also in campy side of things it's always fun watching Hollywood professionals ruin careers for the sake of a paycheck. (The way Madsen looks and acts in this movie I wouldn't hire him to do my lawn and Kingsley acts as if he is auditioning for the Mr. Burns role in an upcoming live action Simpson's movie) So Uwe Boll isn't the next Ed Wood more a talentless Paul Verhoeven.

4481967,2,B004V6AISS,"Director Uwe Boll's (""House of the Dead"") latest foray into the realm of the supernatural is itself a hybrid, much like the film's protagonist--a half-farce, half-travesty journey into the depths of filmmaking hell.  Making sport of director Boll's films is so commonplace that it has become far past fashionable and is now nearer to being pass.  Yet, the man persists in adding fuel to the fire of negative public opinion with the atrocious ""Bloodrayne.""

Kristanna Loken (""Terminator 3"") continues her descent into B-movie obscurity as Rayne, a half-human, half-vampire dhampir who discovers her destiny after escaping from her traveling carnival ""home.""  An attempted rape brings out her bloodrage--resulting in her slaughtering most of her former captors in hyperpressurized arterial blood-spewing bliss--while simultaneously awakening long-hidden memories in Rayne.  The vampire lord Kagan (Ben Kingsley, ""You Kill Me,"" ""Ghandi"") is evidently responsible for both Rayne's existence and the death of her mother.  Swearing vengeance, she embarks upon a journey to further her powers by collecting relict body parts from an ancient vampire destroyed long ago.  As she journeys towards a distinct monastery in search of the first artifact, she is pursued by two opposing factions--those who conspire to serve, and those who pledge to destroy Kagan.

This is the sort of movie which conjures up fear in the heart of the viewer--fear that one will never again find that all-important ""engagement of the senses"" that must occur to enjoy any movie, especially epic fantasy.  I actually began to worry that the atrocious acting, horrible fight choreography, and random sex-themed encounters would destroy my ability to suspend my disbelief in any future movie.

Fight encounter film-editing is a touchy affair.  Edit too slowly or not enough, and combat seems like ""real people"" are doing the fighting--in other words, it's boring.  Edit too quickly, and only an ADHD-afflicted individual off his or her medications can keep up with the action.  ""Bloodrayne"" is guilty of both, with the dubious bonus of copious gore which is frankly silly in its implementation.

Despite blanket negative criticism of the film's actors, they did not all perform terribly, although nary an Oscar performance lurks here.  Playing Vladimir, a leader of the virtuous Brimstone Society, Michael Madsen (""Reservoir Dogs"") performs so horribly that suspicion is cast that he ever possessed acting ability.  He fights like someone who has had their entire vertebral column fused together.  Michelle Rodriguez plays Katarin, the daughter of Brimstone alumnus-turned-vampire Elrich (Billy Zane)--their cinematographic relation is even more believable considering that both have been irrevocably typecast into supporting roles which do little more than provide a paycheck.  Michelle acts like a time machine transported her character from ""The Fast and the Furious"" to medieval Romania, while giving her a sword and tunic for her trouble.  Billy Zane appears to be auditioning for the role of Macbeth.  Meat Loaf turns up in a bizarre scene with allegedly authentic Romanian prostitutes.  The preponderance of accents suggests the movie is taking place at modern-day Heathrow Airport instead of ancient Eastern Europe.

Kingley and Loken actually provided the most believable performances, although they both still bored me to tears.  Ultimately, an action movie which provokes disbelief and boredom in its audience cannot hope to succeed.  The films earns two stars for a couple of nice fight sequences, a few good Ben Kingsley scenes, Loken's genes, and some imaginative, over-the-top pieces of medieval weaponry.",1226793600,3,3684,5.502664298401421

4481973,1,B004V6AISS,"Dante Aligheri's masterpiece, The Divine Comedy, warns of a circle of Hell in which the damned are forced to stand up to their chins in a river of excrement. After sitting through Bloodrayne, you'll know exactly how those poor souls feel. And will want to shower, immediately.

This waste of celluloid is based on a video game and centers around Rayne, a dhampir, (half human-half vampire) who is out to destroy Kagan, her vampire daddy dearest, who had raped her mortal mother, then killed her several years later when he realized he'd sired a child. Whatever. (I wish someone had gotten their hands on the negative and thrown it off a ""damn pier"" before it could be printed).

It seems Kagan is looking for three relics of a once powerful vampire that are hidden throughout the country; possessing them will make him an ber vampire, apparently. Rayne discovers this (don't ask) and goes on a quest to retrieve them first. There's also some anti-vampire crusaders hot on her tail, er trail. A sample of some of the truly ridiculous scenes:

After breaking free of the circus she's imprisoned in as a sideshow freak, attacking anyone in her path, we're treated to Rayne collapsing in a field, wheezing, whining and caterwauling. I suppose the anguished vocalizations are supposed to make us feel the torment of her plight, but it's a little difficult, as she sounds exactly like a laughing hyena, beset with a nasty case of the croup, in the middle of whelping a litter of pups. The next morning, Sebastian and Vladimir, two intrepid vampire hunters, come across the circus. I find it a little strange that none of the circus people bothered to attend to their fallen comrades, not to mention, do nothing to prevent the strangers from killing one of the still alive victims, or decapitate and cremate those already dead. But then, it's best to check your logic at the door on this one.

Later, Rayne stops at a monastery, asking for food and shelter for the night, but it's a ruse; one of the artifacts is hidden there. After a meal and bedding down for the night, our heroine gets up and skulks about the compound to find the relic. She's seen entering the not-so-secret chamber said relic is hidden in by the head monk, from a gallery across the courtyard. Naturally, he's alarmed and takes off (presumably to stop her). She enters the chamber, dispatches the ogre like sentinel (who's sleeping on the job, no less) and grabs the key to yet another secret room. After craftily and acrobatically overcoming the badly CGI'ed booby trap obstacles in her path, she gets the eye (yes, the artifact is a dried up eyeball) it mystically gets sucked into her and, whoa!, she becomes more powerful!

The funniest thing in this segment is wondering why in the hell it takes the monks so long to catch up with her. My guess, the head monk (played by cult icon Udo Kier, looking oh-so-dapper in a monk's tunic fashioned out of a burlap sack) got sidetracked along with the other monk actors at the crafts services table for a belt of bourbon and a cigarette with the crew. Anyway, they catch up to her, Brother Kier explains to her about the other body parts (doing his best impression of Conrad Veidt's somnambulist from The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, that is to say, he sleepwalks through the part) when Kagan's minions arrive and a slaughter begins. Second funniest part; a baddie grabs Kier by the shoulder and the two proceed to simply stand there, watching the others slice and dice each other. You can almost hear Kier's thoughts; ""Okay, I put in my day of work, am I done here?"" Uh, no, not quite, because the filmmaker really needs to add another thirty seconds to your two minutes of existing screen time. Eventually, another bad guy comes up to him, asks him a question about the eye, gets treated to Udo's impersonation of The Who's mute pinball wizard, Tommy, then stabs him. Okay, now you can collect your paycheck and grab the first flight out of town.

Meat Loaf, looking very much like his moniker and a huge side of butter drenched mashed potatoes, plays another vampire, whose palace doubles as some sort of seedy pleasure tavern, where humans are chained up and bled for cocktails, while other vampires get their freak on. One of Kagan's human lackeys brings Rayne there because it's daylight. Sporting a long, pompadour topped, dingy ivory wig suited for the court of Louis XV, as well as the occasional effete mannerism, Mr. Loaf thinks Rayne is pretty sexy. Oh, and he wants the eye she's absorbed. The good guys bust in, fight with (not so) Little Lord Fauntleroy along with one or two other vampires (while about two dozen others sit and watch, huh?) Meat Loaf is overbaked by UV rays and Rayne is rescued. Cause she's a good guy.

Although the cameos by Kier and Mr. Loaf are (for them) mercifully short, the burning question is how in God's name did Ben Kingsley get attached to this project? Yeah, that Ben Kingsley. The guy who won an Oscar for playing Gandhi, the actor who played Stern in Schindler's List. I hope he fired his agent, because he's not relegated to just a two minute cameo; he's a supporting player, Rayne's father, Kagan. While Kier and Loaf were able to obliterate the experience through the excessive consumption of airline provided scotch on the flight back home, Sir Ben was still stuck in this nightmare. Oh, the humanity.

I can't even tell you how this thing ended, other than some major battle and Rayne being the sole survivor. Watching just half of this made my brain bleed. Uwe Bll is truly a crapmeister extraordinaire. I'd long read about Bll's complete lack of skill behind the camera, but never witnessed it. How I wish I never had.",1210896000,5,5682,4.68068068068068

4481975,3,B004V6AISS,"Let me start by saying that I bought this becuase the video game comes with it, and the movie+game are cheaper than the game by itself.  Which tells you something about the value of the movie.
As for theme/plot, it's a daughter's quest for vengance against the dirty creep (who happens to be a vamipre overlord) who raped and murdered her mother.  She presents a pretty sympathetic character for the ""building"" part of her development, as long as you have a reasonable level of suspension of belief.  The action sequences are either poorly trained-for or poorly directed; none of the actors seem comfortable or familiar with their weapons or movement with them.  The story line by itself is rather compelling, and could make a good book or a good movie, were it to be re-done by someone with a modicum of talent (or perhaps budget?).
So the movie isn't as bad as everyone says.  It has horrible dialogue at times (it's hard to tell if it is the actors' or director's fault), and the director should be shot and the cost of the bullet billed to his family; however, you can do worse.  The end of the movie actually made me laugh, then just get up and let it finish without bothering to watch (the end scene is stupendously atrocious).  But again, that's the director/editor's fault.
The good parts: the story line is interesting, with potential.  Standard fare for vampire flick fans, even better than, say, Van Helsing... it usually managed to minimize the cheese factor.  The lead actress isn't exactly hard to look at.  The effects and such are... passable.  Not great, but average for a ""sub-prime"" movie.  There is an almost silly level of gore in the fight scenes, but hey, it's a vampires-with-swords movie.  The acting was far from astounding, but was usually passable.  It's about Arnold Governator level acting.  Yeah, there are rough spots, but again, no worse than your average below-blockbuster level movie.  Oh, and the cinematography was interesting at times.  Odd, considering how bad the directing was.
Over all, I'd say this is ""Army of Darkness"" meets ""Queen of the Damned,"" and directed by Michael Bay or some other mildly retarded squirrel.  Worth about $4-5, if you're looking for another vampire-ess flick.",1204329600,7,2228,4.849206349206349
4481976,3,B004V6AISS,"Before I watched this movie I read a lot of the one star reviews here on Amazon.  I must say they significantly lowered my expectations for this movie.  Now, this isn't a good movie by any means, but after reading all the negativity, I was expecting something much much worse... like worst movie I could ever imagine, but this movie is better than Manitou (that's one of the worst films I ever saw).

Now, my review is strictly based on the movie for this is my first experience with the Bloodrayne universe.  I've been desperate to find another Femme Fatale character I could get into since Chaos! Comics closed up shop and stopped printing Purgatori.  I found out they were also making Bloodrayne comics and her character looked interesting.  I'm very backlogged in my video games and I have not been able to play the games yet, but I plan on playing them soon!

As I've already mentioned, this movie actually beat what I was expecting based on the reviews I read here... that or I am quite easily amused.  There are some absolutely horrible parts of this movie though; like Michael Madson's character, Vladamir, always felt out of place.  He just didn't act well in this movie, it's not Resovoir Dogs.  Kristanna Loken did an alright job as Rayne though, better than I was expecting.  The love making scene was absolutely hilarious though because it was so over exaggerated.  And, yes, she is seen topless, for those who only wanted to see the movie for that fact alone.  Ben Kingsley did a fairly poor performance throughout the whole film, up until the very end during the fight scene.  I thought he finally held the air of royalty as the vampire lord during that scene.

The other part of the movie that was absolutely laughable was the gore from the fight scenes.  Seriously, they're absolutely absurd, even for a medieval enactment.  There's one scene where this one guy puts a sword through another guys face then lets go of the sword.  Who does that?  No, you KEEP your blade or else you're screwed; you don't let go for the sake of a good camera gore shot.  Then there's a part where it shows this guy on the ground and a group of men hitting him in the face with maces.  The ""guy"" or mannequin's face is turned to pulp, but do they stop after he's dead?  Nope, five guys stand there and keep hitting the ground.  They even looked bored doing it... there's nothing maniacal about these evil attackers.

In the end, I was actually entertained.  It doesn't have a lot of re-watch value, but it's good enough to watch with friends... especially those who will offer up the perfect sarcastic comment at just the right time.  One thing I will warn, do NOT pay full price for this film.  Wait till it costs six dollars used.

The Good Things:
-Kristanna Loken looks great and plays a pretty good character.  I think she may have humanized the role a little; that could be seen as good or bad.  She sure beats the crud out of Natassia Malthe, who plays Rayne in the sequel.
-There's lots of gratuitous blood, gore, and sex.  It's not for the squeamish.  In fact, it's better for anybody who loves graphic NR-rated content.
-Makeup effects are very wicked.  Did I mention there was lots of violence?
-Ben Kingsley, Michelle Rodriguez, and Michael Madsen are all in it, along with some other familiar faces.  Cool!
-It's a wickedly dark portrayal of medieval life.

The Bad Things:
-Nothing is of great quality or value in this film.  It all feels subpar.
-There's no real romance, even though they tried to put a love story into it.
-Even though there are a lot of good action scenes, the action is not choreographed as smoothly as it could have been.  It's like if ""Army of Darkness"" had kung fu; a little awkward.
-The plot is very thin, and you won't really understand it unless you pay close enough attention.  Even then, don't bother.  The plot doesn't really take precedence in this film (is that bad, or what?).

It's a bad movie, but it's good for those who like bad movies.  I like to pop it in if I have a sudden urge to see some senseless violence or sex.  A few memorable parts also make it worthwhile (I love the ending).

4481983,1,B004V6AISS,"Bloodrayne (Uwe Boll, 2005)

Every once in a while you run across a director of truly bad movies, but every time he takes on a project, he does something that, despite your knowing the movie is going to be even worse than the last godawful piece of crap he released, still makes you want to see it.

In this case, Uwe Boll, responsible for such execrable movies as Alone in the Dark and House of the Dead, somehow managed to rope in a cast it's quite hard to believe were willing to take a chance on a videogame-based Uwe Boll movie. Topping the list of ""what were they thinking?"" actors here is Ben Kingsley. Can you believe this guy played Gandhi? Michael Madsen (Reservoir Dogs), Billy Zane (Posse), Michelle Rodriguez (Girlfight), Udo Kier (Suspiria), and a number of others come along for the ride as well. I can't believe all of them were that strapped for cash. All of them are billed under TV actress Kristianna Loken (who last saw the big screen while playing the bad boss monster in Terminator 3), in the movie's title role, a half-vampire half-human who's out to kill Kingsley's character, Kagan, because Kagan killed Rayne's mother. The fact that he's also her father doesn't seem to make her question her motivation much. Not that anyone in this movie has enough of a character to really have much motivation.

That doesn't seem to bother Boll, who cuts this movie from exactly the same cloth as his others: lots of action, hints of sex that might actually be interesting if he cared enough to explore those scenes, a useless script, camerawork that's just this side of competent, and Boll's somewhat impressive ability to wring the worst possible acting out of anyone he casts.

And yet, despite all this, the most depressing thing about Bloodrayne is that the movie actually did well enough overseas (predictably, it flopped like a nightmare in America, making two and a half million, well under one-fifth of its budget) that Vivendi greenlighted Bloodrayne II. At least none of the original cast, including Loken, were hard up enough to sign on for what cannot help but be another Boll monstrosity. (zero)",1190332800,4,2121,4.755434782608695

I will say that the best part of the film for me was the sex scene, with Loken, when she broke out of her prison and ""raped"" her love interest, as a man that's what you dream of. This film just didn't work in anyway, I like some dumb movies, and this wasn't even that. Maybe if it didn't try to be serious, it would have been OK.

I don't care how much they dress up the DVD version of this movie, it won't change the fact that it's terrible.  I'm only giving this one-star, but keep about five or six Advil handy. That ought to be enough to cover you for this.

A couple of tid-bits about this disaster:

1. It's made by Uwe Boll, helmer of two of the WORST movies I've ever seen in 'House of the Dead' and 'Alone in the Dark.'

2. In what (to me) was a staggering moment of brutal honesty, Boll himself admitted that he didn't cast the movie until TWO WEEKS before filming began. What he wound up with are a bunch of ""names"" that happened to have a hole in their schedule and showed up for a quick paycheck and a free trip to Romania. It shows too, the whole film feels like they just totally skipped rehersal and nobody looks even half-interested in making an honest effort.

3. Will Sanderson and Michael Madsen may have discovered the only way to survive a Boll film. They were reportly completely drunk through the whole production.

4. Ben Kingsley, who previously had to deal with Madsen on the film 'Species' refused to even be on the same set with him.

5. In the harem scene with Meatloaf, those are HONEST TO GOD, 100% FULL-BLOODED ROMANIAN PROSTITUTES. I swear you can't make this stuff up. Apparently, Boll couldn't afford real actresses (their union rates made them too expensive), so he decided he could cut costs by just ordering-out for the real thing.

This is a disaster from front to back. I'll give it this though, it's better then his last two films. 'Bloodrayne', at least, is a little bit unintentionally funny. Even having said that though, I could never recommend anyone ever see this. It'll only encourage the man to keep going.

Uwe Boll, without a doubt in my mind, is the most talentless film-maker I've ever seen. I'm absolutely astonished that this guy keeps finding his way behind a camera ...",1184371200,3,2022,4.5

In other words, you're a cinematic sadist.  If you've already seen this movie, then you've probably lost some self esteem.  If you plan on seeing it after you read this review...you're just a masochist.

Bloodrayne is horrible.  Beyond horrible.  Ben Kingsley has made some bad career choices in his day but this one takes the cake.  Michael Madsen, who used to be considered respectable if not great, is heading down the career failing slope faster than a California mudslide after a monsoon.  Michelle Rodriguez, who has openly stated she wants to be a gypsy actress, a free spirit, is the most unscathed simply because you're going to limit yourself with that kind of career decision.  That doesn't get her off the hook for this travesty.  I can't imagine anyone as rebellious as her standing quietly while this heap of crud was being dumped around her like garbage at a landfill.

He picked this atrocity to decide he wants to be credited with TWO names instead of ONE?  HUH?!

Everyone else is unknown, which surprisingly doesn't leave many roles left for the unknowns.  It was amazing how they amassed this group of named actors for something so horribly bad.  It's not just the actors, it's the dialogue, the F/X and the even the plot...which escapes me for the moment.  I guess I'm trying to remove this movie from my memory.

4481994,3,B004V6AISS,"So many bad reviews and so much adverse comment as to the skills of Uwe Boll, was it deserved ? I'm afraid the answer is largely yes, this film is patchy in the extreme, truly laden with clichs and in common with most game derived movies seems to have been written by somebody with only a passing knowledge of the game. Which is pretty silly as BloodRayne the game doesn't exactly have the most complex plot ever seen. For example in the game Rayne a Dhampir is searching for her father, the setting is Europe in the nineteen thirties, she is located and hired by the Brimstone society and then goes on a series of missions recovering three artefacts from the Thule Society.
For reasons that remain unexplained the film decided to run as a prequel and being scripted as a predictable clich is set in that mythical eastern Europe beloved of Hammer and all the old Dracula movies. There Rayne is looking for her father and is found and trained by the Brimstone society, presumably they mutually forget each other and the later game setting meeting is an amnesiacs reunion. In common with the game Rayne searches for the artefacts of Beliar, though these would appear to be somewhat different to the game versions she searches out later, presumably some kind of generic naming system for supernatural items. If you're going to do a prequel at least make it imaginative, why swipe bits from the game and take them out of context? It's lazy means nothing to non gamers and will only irritate the game fans who are the core audience. Rayne acquires two artefacts and we are told becomes incredibly powerful, though the special effects budget clearly doesn't run to anything that could demonstrate this. She then gets to enter her fathers castle and kill him, another sign of memory loss perhaps as having exterminated dear old dad, one wonders why she spends the next century or so looking for him, or how he crops up in the game BloodRayne 2. Still not to get bogged down in details, lets look at the film as it stands. As I've already said it's clichd, oldie worldie eastern European settings and a plot that creaks. A massive and pointless overdose of dismemberment, luridly blood splattered and all very badly done, poorly choreographed and filmed fight scenes, the list goes on. Then we look at the actors, Madsen and Rodriguez are fine in their comfort zone as urban Americans with attitude, take them out of the zone and their limitations are painfully obvious, they just do not fit into this scenario and utter some of the most painfully stilted lines ever committed to film. Kristanna Locken isn't the worlds greatest actor, but at least she tries, which is more than can be said for the Oscar winning Sir Ben Ghandi Kingsley who's performance is so wooden it's teak like, a man who is clearly hating every moment of the shoot, has no idea why he signed the contract and wants everybody to know what a bad time he's having. Instead of dark and brooding, his head vampire just comes over as constipated.  It's not a good movie, but given time may acquire a bit of cult cachet as one of those bad movies you need to see.
And yet despite all this I'm not spitting blood at money wasted and that's because the set includes a DVD copy of BloodRayne 2 the game and to be honest that's what I was after in the first place.

4482001,2,B004V6AISS,"Bad script plus uncaring actors in a movie with horrible make up and battle sequences equal a pretty lousy movie. Sadly, that is what this movie is. In the right hands, this could have been a lot better than it turned out. In Uwe Boll's hands, it turns to trash and a disgrace to the franchise, and once again this has been proven as true.  The sad part is, the start of the film was pretty interesting, but it quickly goes down hill after about the first ten minutes.

This film has some pretty well known actors, Ben Kingsley and Michael Madsen to name a couple. The problem is, they didn't seem to care about the script and felt bored the entire movie. Ben Kingsley is a well respected actor and he only gave a half a performance in the movie and it can be seen with everyone in the movie. The script itself wasn't anything worth seeing in the first place. It is literally dull, and when it's not, the dialogue at times is embarrassing. It feels more like watching a stage play written  and performed by a group of high school students instead of watching paid Hollywood actors giving their third best when it comes to acting and horrible directing.

The make up for the vampires in the film almost disappointed me as much as the zombies from ""House of the Dead"". It looked cheap and a rip off of vampires seen in so many other TV series and movies such as ""From Dusk to Dawn"" and ""Angel"", both of which are better. The fight scenes look very amateurish and cut so it could be put together faster. It looked so bad, you could almost see the actors not even touching each other and the only way you can someone is fighting is by the swords clanking as they hit each other.

Overall, I was severely disappointed with this movie. I didn't believe the other reviews saying how bad this movie was, but they were correct. I tried to enjoy it, but it was just a disappointment by the end, which is another problem. The ending was confusing! What a crappy way to end the movie.

Regardless of when it will be made, it will surely not be directed by Uwe Boll.

Barely improving his shamelessly godawful techniques from ""House Of The Dead,"" the German director sets out once more to re-craft (and largely destory) a gamer legacy, this time in the form of the gory, vampire-themed action title, ""BloodRayne."" Featuring Kristanna Loken in the less-than-enigmatic role of Rayne, a vampire-human hybrid set out to avenge her mother's death by the hands of the big, bad vamp Kagan, the film showcases un-noteable acting, less-than-exciting fight sequences, plenty of bare flesh, and a shameless amount of bloodletting.

Disregarding the video game's original storyline of a pre-WWII demon-slaying adventure, the film takes place in a fictional medieval universe where a vampire seeks the remnants of an enigmatic ancestor to empower himself, while his hybrid daughter seeks his death for the murdering of her mother. The film follows Rayne as she escapes her gypsy-esque captors and becomes integrated into the Brimstone Society, which seeks to bring down the ambitious Kagan.

Told hastily and in a Harry Potter-like chopping fashion, the film's storyline is provided neither depth nor importance, as the contained scenarios hardly reach out to the audience, highlighting little more than the gory battle scenes, the senseless sexual encounters, and some forced moments of American-envisioned glory. The film's main appeal, after having discarded entirely with the foundations of the video game, is to those exciteable by an excess of blood and sex, both of which are presented in unnecessary amounts and without much motivation behind them.

Nothing in particular about ""BloodRayne"" is outstanding or even beyond average or run-of-the-mill - the story has been told before, the production is reminicent of any weekly television show, the acting is nowhere near award-winning, and there are better fight scenes in ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"" than in this production. Even a surprise appearance by rock & roll hero Meat Loaf can't lift this film close to the barline, and its inadequacy as even a summer blockbuster can't be masked by the obscene depictions of violence (pure shock factors) that serves as one of the film's foundations.

While the producers can be credited for employing better graphics, costumes, and art direction than depicted in ""House Of The Dead"" and by exhibiting a gorgeous mountainous terrain in several scenes (truly reminicent of ""Lord Of The Rings""), no amount of tidbits can cover up ""BloodRayne""'s lackluster portrayal as just another silly action film, and just another bad effort by Uwe ""can't-take-a-hint"" Boll.",1167609600,2,2798,5.347727272727273

Michael Madsen plays his usual tough guy but with long hair and tunic and it just doesn't come off as well.  Ben Kingsley is Rayne's vampire father and a local warlord.  Rayne escapes from being a captive of a traveling circus and the plot begins.

Madsen and company are part of something called Brimstone.  They hunt vampires and Madsen is looking for Rayne as he suspects what she really is.  Kingsley is building his army and getting ready to seize power.  Only the weakened Brimstone stands in his way.  If he can collect three parts from a legendary vampire, he will be unstoppable.  Rayne wants to kill vampires.

We never learn what Brimstone really is or what they are capable of.  We don't know who Kingsley is seizing power from as there seems to be no government or rulers.  The ending is strange and non-climactic.  The special effects are laughable with the effects team spending their time on making blood spray fiercely from the slightest of wounds and even from dead bodies.

How does he do it? By ""he"", I'm referring to Uwe Boll and I keep asking that question. How does he keep: a)making horrible movies; b)still getting opportunities to make more movies; and c) getting top-notch actors in his movies? It's just amazing how the cinematic world allows people like Boll to do whatever they want to ruin successful video game franchises. This time, the next victim is ""Bloodrayne"". Although the movie will only open in 2006, a preview screening was shown in the Austin Film Festival and I was one of the (un)lucky ones to be able to watch it. Wow. He actually CAN spoil franchises.

At least, Bloodrayne isn't considered one of the most life-changing video games in the world. It is actually about action, violence, and vampire powers. This ""Bloodrayne"" unites stars such as Ben Kingsley (who is not in a very good form lately), Michael Madsen, Michelle Rodriguez, and Kristianna Lokken, known for her role in Terminator 3. Technically, ""Bloodrayne"" is better than ""House of the Dead"", but worse than ""Alone in the Dark"". It is a joke that seems to take on forever, dragging itself on and on through embarrassing fighting sequences. Dreadful actings, shameful dialogues, and a sex scene indicate we are watching another Uwe Boll film. The entertaining video game becomes a forgettable movie in the hand of today's Ed Wood.

Despite one or two decent scenes, ""Bloodrayne"" is absolutely horrible. The story about a major vampire leader, called Kagan (sadly portrayed by Ben Kingsley) who is chased by vampire hunters (Michael Madsen in a disappointing role) is poor and flawed. Kristianna Loken looks really sexy, but as an actress, she is lame. As Rayne, a vengeful dhampir (half human, half vampire), she reminds us why Razzies are in the world for. Almost nothing in this movie works. This is one more of those movies you find tons of clones in the closest videostore. During the screening, I wanted to leave bad, but literally came to tears when I found out I couldn't. ""Bloodrayne"" is waste of time, money, human logic, and sanity. It's torturous, painful, and sad. As for the actual DVD, the special features sucked, and not even the addition of the whole version of the PC game ""Bloodrayne II"" brought my score up... the game sucks too. -_-

I'm sure ""Bloodrayne"" will attract tons of hardcore fans who may just believe Uwe Boll has learned his lesson. So I end this review by saying two very important words: he didn't. ""Bloodrayne"" is one more of his irritating mistakes and is one more movie where you can learn a lesson from in the most painful way possible. Enjoy life to the fullest.

I suppose it's somewhat callous of we the fans to relish so much the pursuit of Boll bashing, but if the man didn't so vigorously attempt to make excuses for and defend his work in interviews, I would be much more willing to cut him slack.  It's one thing to make a terrible movie and defend it through a delusional assumption that it's somehow good, but another to try to cover yourself when you know you're making dreck.  I wait patiently for Uwe's half hearted defenses of Bloodrayne.

As in all of these half baked, video game based quickies, the plot is irrelevant.  That's not to say a descent story couldn't have been produced about the character of Rayne,  but it certainly fell flat on it's face here.  The script is the first culprit.  It comes off about like something I wrote in tenth grade English class.  Every cliche imaginable is on display. It's as if screenwriter Guinevere Turner had an encylopedia of banalities. I suppose the excuse could be that she is new to this sort of piece but come on. The world is non-descript and full of things incongruous with it's old world setting. But despite said anachronisms, the dialog is nothing but stiff, old-worldy speak with a humorous aversion to contractions in sentences. The various plot machinations that provide the impetus for the characters actions always remain vague and irrelevant. There is just so little here for the actors to work with.

Not that they are trying to hard. No one here seemed to give a crap, which is understandable. There is humor to be had though in the clumsy, stilted line deliveries of many of the actors. It almost seemed as if some of them, (Michael Madsen and Michele Rodriquez most obviously), were reading the dialog off a cue cards for the first time. Udo Kier and Billy Zane have pointlessly tiny rolls,(though Zane manages to ladle on some of his particular oddball qualities). Ben Kingsley basically sits in the same chair for three quarters of the movie, barely reacting to anything anyone says to him. And Meatloaf, well..I find myself somewhat nonplused by his short sequence in the film. All I'll say is that was one hell of a wig.

Let's see..was there anything good? I will say that Kristanna Loken is definately hot. It's hard to say if she can act because there is not dialog worth reciting and no director capable of pushing her in the direction of a performance, but she definately looks like I would imagine Rayne. The gore, particularly on the Unrated version, is rather vivid, if a little clumsy and unconvincing. There's a big troll..who's never really explained..and..uh..ah, hell, I just wish someone would give Uwe Boll some career advice. Maybe he could be a fight scene choreographer, he likes those, or he could try his hand at being a Production Assistant, work his way back to the top, relearn how to make a movie. Heck, he could be a garbage man for all I care, someone just tell him to stop making movies. In that way, all of mankind could benefit.",1160956800,4,3246,4.663747810858144

You can look far and wide and you will never find another movie as good made from that video game...at least until the inevitable ""Bloodrayne 2,"" which will naturally surpass the original in every respect, as all sequels do! This movie features Kristanna Loken in the title role. Ms. Loken strains so hard at acting that she looks physically ill whenever a scene calls for anything more than rote recitation of her lines--now THAT'S DEDICATION. Ms. Loken may very well be the new Meryl Streep. They even both have the letters S, T, R, L, and E in their names! Fortunately for Ms. Loken, the film generally only requires her to stand around looking hot and reciting dialogue so subtle and low-key that, to the unenlightened, it might seem wooden or cornball. Anyway, Ms. Loken plays a half-vampire hottie in this movie, and that's something that's never been done before in any movies based on the ""Bloodrayne"" video game.

Obviously the movie as Homer Simpson would say is the suckiest suck that ever sucked.  Pretty much everything that Uwe Boll aka ""Toilet Boll"" directs has sucked to high hell.  To be able to watch a movie from this director would be to be drunk or stoned or both.  Even then it might not be enough.  The good news is to use his movies as a torture device for terrorists.  Somebody suggested that the only thing Boll should direct is a porn flick.  I beg to differ.  I'm sure he'll find some way of ruining that as well.  He'd probably concentrate on the man's member instead of the woman.  No, the only thing Boll should direct should be the end of his career.  What's incredibly entertaining about this movie is the reviews from this site and from the critics on rottentomatoes.  While reading them, I bursted out laughing on several occasions for minutes.  The comment from a previous critic about how the prostitutes in the movie were real Romanian prostitutes is a riot.

Ya see, Uwe Boll has a reputation in the filmworld.  Supposedly he's the worst director out there right now.  It's not often that a director comes along that both filmgoers and critics single out as being absolutely terrible.  Naturally this intrigued me.  And after all, who could be worse than Michael Bay?  Bloodrayne just looked stupid from the getgo. If you ask me, making a movie from the premise of a friggin' video game is a stupid idea no matter how you cut it.  Does the film suck?  Of course it does.  But with Boll's reputation I was expecting more(or less?).  With all I have read about this guy I was expecting a bad movie to a dimension of which bad movies have never ventured to.  Something just so unredeemable and abyssmal that you just can't put it into words.  I wasn't expecting to like it, nor was I expecting a ""so bad it's good"" kinda thing, but I was expecting something unique.  Maybe I had my expectations too high(or low).  What I got was a piece of crap typical of any modern vampire or horror film Hollywood puts out anymore.  This movie would have sucked , Boll directing or not.  Ben Kingsley(that's oscar winner Ben Kingsley) looks rather embarassed.  Madsen looks pissed, drunk and bored.  The chick isn't anywhere near as tantalizing as you're supposed to believe.  Who the hell knows what Billy Zane's character was in it for?  Meatloaf hams it up and looks rather silly in a very small part.  I know he'd do anything for love, but he shouldn't have done that.  There's a bonus feature called Dinner With Uwe Boll.  In this fun little feature two bored looking interviewers talk to Boll about his career while they slurp down something that looks like chinese takeout.  They're all drinking glasses of wine too, but Uwe also has a Diet Mountain Dew.  There's something amusing and disturbing about this interview.  Boll talks so highly of his career and it's weird to watch everyone eat.  Why two stars?  Well, if anything good about Boll can be said, he certainly isn't shy when it comes to onscreen gore.  Kinda cheesy gore, but that's the most fun kind, isn't it?  Plus, Boll hasn't remade a classic horror film under the arrogance that he could somehow do it better.

Unless you're interested in a moive that is so terrible that it makes you laugh, DO NOT BUY THIS FILM!  It is a total disaster!  Movie Rayne is nothing like her videogame counterpart.  The fight scenes were slow, nothing at all like the fluidity of the game.  And don't get me started on the gore...I've seen better setups in a walk-through haunted house.  Nothing was done realistically, and the ten-minute recap at the end of the movie (which was done for some reason I will never understand) only displays how sloppy it is.  The acting wasn't great, either, and the brief sex scene...lets just say I found myself laughing through most of this mess.  Needless to day, the plot was also lacking (and that's putting it lightly).

Then there's Kristanna Loken (that lady Terminator), Ben Kingsley, and a few other good names to distinguish this movie. Somehow, though, even they fail to pull it out of the dumper. Loken, for example, gets to wear skintight leather stuff. OK, so far, but would any woman on earth really want pants tailored with blood-red stripes running down the inner thighs? There's only one reason she might: if the alternative was to wear Kingsley's wig.

That oops-my-monthlies look might not be a problem, in the end. There's so much gore spattered here, there, and everywhere, that pretty much everybody is going to be covered in red stripes anyway. Whoever was pumping the red gushers must have had a heck of a time keeping up with them all.

Plot? Oh, yeah, some vampire thing. There were bad guys, plucky band of heroes, and magic amulets - or maybe I'm thinking of some other movie. Again, it hardly matters since I won't be thinking of this one for very long.

Maybe it was the lame action that moves super slow.  the fighting was like they were just rehearsing it for the first time and the had to get it right on the first take so the did it really slow.  if you watch the trailer, the action is much faster than in the actual movie so don't let the trailer fool you.  all these great actors act as if they were board when making this movie in that they all kind of just spit out the lines with no enthusiasm, especially Michael Madsen (who was great in kill bill vol 2).  the director Uwe Boll really has a strange vision of what a film should be.  this movie is like a epasode of xena warrior princess rather than a big buget action movie.  its SUPER condensed and the whole movie feels like your only watching the first 10 minutes and you have to wait for it to get started.  ive never seen a movie like this before.  at least its good for a laugh i guess.",1151452800,4,1259,4.118852459016393

So I guess I'll have to pass.....

I am huge fan of UNDERWORLD-there's so much talent, and a REAL STORY.  I also like Milla Jovovich and am buying the ULTRAVIOLET DVD despite it's resemblance to RESIDENT

EVIL, which I also enjoy.  With Milla you're either are a fan or not.  I know Ultraviolet may not be that great but I think I will be keeper for my library ( of course! ) She's not Kate Beckinsale or Uma Thurman but what she did in the THE FIFTH ELEMENT is so close to my heart - she's special. And she did

do THE MESSENGER and be sure to see her in DUMMY, it's obvious she is a unique talent. I hope she gets more notice here in the US - The same for Kate Beckinsale.  I am so sick of magazines that have Teri Hatcher, Jennifer Aniston or Jessica Simpson on countless covers of the mags here in CA, USA - who cares! If there is an underground of heavyweights that watch stories like UNDERWORLD and THE FIFTH ELEMENT, FINAL FANTASY, I do wish we could see these heroines and heros get there share of the visuals.

And take note: Before they hand out the Academy Awards and Golden Globes, etc.,- I believe the ""lucrative after market of DVDs "" as Kevin Smith put it, would be taken into consideration.  Maybe ULTRAVIOLET

didn't do so well at the shopping mall theater they stuck it into but I know Milla's DVD of that same film is going to rake it $$$$$$$-when it is released.

I wouldn't watch BLOODRAYNE  on TV either - They'll chop it up

to a G rating for SCI FI  channel - forget that!

  I don't like commerlized TV - it interupts the story I am watching.

TCM and PBS are the only free TV I can accept.

As for BLOODRAYNE, I was hoping to find other films, character studies - STORIES! but I already have read/seen that 92 people wrote in with a vote of NO. WOW - if its that it must have been worth so many people writing about it. I guess it must be that bad.

I appreciate the longer, well versed/well written reviews.  And the person who wrote in that he/she desired to have their eyes

washed out with BLEACH is a real zinger - thanks!

Only if I get freebie at Blockbuster w/ my rewards card will I consider watching it ( I only have showtime on our limited but

free cable that comes w/the rent - I have no idea if they run this movie there).

All I can say is this film is about Rayne is after Ben Kingsley for killing her mother. Revenge never tasted so bland. I can't believe Michael Madsen stared in this crap-fest, is he trying to kill his career after it was saved by Quentin Tarantino? Michelle Rodriguez already has a bad record in life, I guess she wants to add I did a Uwe Suck film in her record.

The acting defies logic. Watching actors and actresses spewing lines that sound more like a recent rendition of Hamlet at your local high school, minus the sheer teenage angst and nervousness to fool the ear into thinking that there was emotion back there. The plot is moved along with gratuitous violence, very akin to the game itself, however, between each fight scene they had to talk, and we are forced to listen otherwise we will never know if the movie was that good or bad.

Aside from the tirade about the acting, the gore scenes were just that, gore scenes. Blood spraying across the camera and all the actors from the smallest cut, thralls dicing other mortals to shreds with inhuman strength possessed only by their masters.

Unfortunately I cannot say the same for ""Bloodrayne"" which is neither scary nor campy. What I didn't like the most about this turkey of a movie was the way it edited. There was no real beginning. Everything the viewer learns about Rayne (Kristanna Loken) is through a series of annoying flashbacks. I cannot believe that Oscar winner Ben Kingsley was tied to this awful film at least ""Species"" was actually scary, disgusting, yet entertaining. ""Bloodrayne"" is neither. Up until now I never thought a love scene could be so hilarious (unintentionally) until I saw Rayne and Sebastian get it on. It was so bad that it was funny. Although the two Underworld films really don't offer anything substantially at least those films were entertaining, ""Bloodrayne"" was not. Bad acting, bad writing, bad everything. Apparently Hollywood has not learned from past disasters that video games do not make for good films (i.e ""Super Mario Bros."" and the ""Mortal Kombat"" films).",1149897600,5,1056,5.005681818181818
4482072,2,B004V6AISS,"Okay this is bad. The director (Editor?) jerks you from scene to scene, the writing's labored and some things just don't make sense. In the beginning of the movie, for instance, it's stated pretty clearly that plain water will kill a vampire. (Disregarding of course the fact that blood itself is 83% water.) Later on though one of the heroes specifically chooses holy water as weapon so it's a little hard to figure. And as much as I like Michael Madsen I have to say, yeah, he's just awful here. That said though, this isn't as bad a movie as some of the reviews would lead you to believe. Most of the cast gives an honest effort (The Romanian prostitutes aren't half bad.), Kristanna Loken is about the sexiest vampire slayer ever and Michelle Rodriguez is a pretty close second. And in my book anyway, any movie with Meat Loaf in it gets an automatic two stars for cool. And while some of the special effects look like, well, special effects, some of the gore is pretty good. So here's what I'm thinking. If you're not into gore or vampires, don't bother with this one. But if you're sitting on the fence, yeah, go ahead, give it a try.

I like fantasy movies that deal with vampires, I'm a fan of the Underworld series. This movie I think need to be filmed with a softer look to it. I think that it was too harsh looking with the type of filter that they used for the cameras. It was one step away from being ""Soap Opera"" camera quality. That ultra realistic look.

There was too much blood from wounds that wouldn't have actualy caused that much to come out of someones body. I watched the Directors cut, so I don't know if this had anything to do with the excess in the blood. (Also no really good fight scenes.)

The acting was goods, but the plot was only okay. There were holes in the backstory of Rayne and the other main characters on top of that. Most things weren't explained very well for this movie.

I think that the director could have gotten a better film if he changed things on it. There was definatly too much blood, not enough plot, and didn't cause me to have very much interest in the main characters. I didn't like it very much.",1149552000,,1181,4.258928571428571

What saves this movie from being a total bore is all the blood the director pumps onto the screen. People get chopped up and ripped up in some pretty interesting ways. There is also a decent amount of T and A.

The casting is really strange. How did F Murray Abraham get talked into playing the head vampire? He is totally unconvincing in this role. Michael Madsen mumbles his way throughout the entire film, I kept turning the sound  up when he was speaking - ""grumble-mumble-we-must-be-prepared-for-battle-grumble"".

im pretty sure i said that this is such a horrible film that its an embarassment to even want to watch it and here is the reasons WHY.

1. They can definatly get a much better actress then whoever her name was that played rayne. not only was her acting such a dissapointmnet, the only scene that made up for it was her boob exposure scene and the horribly done love making scene. her clothes were total embarassment. how high do you want those pants lady??? if your not afraid to show off your breasts, then why is it so hard to show off a little bit more navel? her pants looks like the ones my grandma wears! hiked high up.

2. OK now here is where i get peevish. if you looked closely. how is it that rayne slices a guys stomach in one direction but the blood is being shot at a diffrent direction??? like there was a water hose right in front of the guy ready to squirt away in FRONT of him. not AWAY from him...

3. did you see that scary oger dude she had to kill? the one that looks like the hunch back but then she bashed in his skull??? why is it the skull bounces back like plastic?? and the body was so pillow like. i don't know...i wasn't aware that a persons head held that much blood ready to pour out like that...facinating.

4. too much blood trying to cover up the worst of the fights? i think so.

5. the effects. if there was a well deep enough to throw this horrible film in. i would do it. might as well put cement on it and cover it all up unmarked. to the director who made this film, please do us a favor and STOP DIRECTING!

6. the sword fighting scenes...i seen better when given my 5 year old cousin a branch! what is up with the scenes. not only were they SLOW MOTION but they were so rehearshed even that made them look like jerking robots!

The cast was very appealing, but none could deliver a good performance dued to the cheessy and bad script and character writen. Not even a great actor like Kingsley was worthwhile watching as the villian in this film. Michael Madsen was severely underused and wasted in a low-key supporting role. I was so looking forward to seeing Kristanna Loken again since T3, but this film offered her a poorly writen character and the fight scenes were boring and lack of visual style. A far cry from her T3 kickass performance. As a costume/wardrobe designer, I am not impressed with the costumes, and Loken is not very pretty in makeup and costume here. I am even confused by Kingsley's part period and part modern costume. Is it a period piece or a timeless era? I haven't followed the video game this film is based on. What was good some of the landscapes and set decs. Oh yeah, there is lots of blood and gore, but not as nasty as Saw kind of stuff. The verdict, this film is just a much lower budget feature version of films like Dracula2000, Van Helsing, and Underworld. No wonder it's a straight to dvd film.",1149206400,3,1159,4.523809523809524
4482081,5,B004V6AISS,"Obviously,my review is going to have a positive bias to it.

First off,I'm not rating this movie based on ""plot"" or ""acting skills.""

I watched this movie because I am a huge fan of beautiful women

dressing up as sexy video game heroines;also known as ""cosplay"".

I still have and love Tomb Raider because of the Lara Croft shower scene.

The Rayne's Seduction scene in Bloodrayne is like that only 5000 times better!

The scene is very sexy,agressive and includes nudity and lasts pretty long.

So if that sounds like something that would peak your interest (I don't know too many

Bloodrayne fans who wouldn't like this type of thing)then buy the movie already! The

fact that a free PC version of Bloodrayne2 is thrown in,only makes the deal sweeter.

If you are expecting groundbreaking acting or storyline,then this is not for you.

However,I don't think many people would expect such things like that in this type of movie.

Bloodrayne is all about sexy butt-kicking women,nudity,vampires

and violent fantasy fun. Trust me there's alot worse dvds that you could buy at this time;

Instead, do what I did. Have an expectation of some overacting, some bad cgi, and a crappy direction due to the director being Uwe Boll who has never directed a ""good"" movie. Look for aspects of the game aka BloodRayne's attire, attitude, some of the story from both games 1 and 2... and look for good blood rage scenes. If you go in thinking that before you see the movie... do not compare it TOTALLY to the games and to ANY other vampire movie... you will have the same thoughts I am about to share with you.

The GOOD:

BloodRayne was not a bad movie nor was it a great movie. It was a decent movie for one based on a video game. There was no overacting (save for a few scenes) and the CGI was awesome actually (especially the castles). Blood rage and Blood effects were awesome. And Rayne herself has SOME of her aspects and attitude from the games in the movie. Michael Madsen, I love you. You did such an AWESOME role as Vladamir. AWESOME DUDE. There has yet to be a movie Michael Madsen has done that I have NOT liked him in. UDO KEIR... I love you my man. You are a horror legend and anytime I see you, I am always in awe of you. I love you seriously. Billy Zane, you rock the socks like no tomorrow. I love ya! You seriously should have played Rayne's father Kagan. Zane as Kagan would have majorly rocked!!!! Costuming... ROCKED!!! Enough Said.

THE BAD and UGLY:

However, I believe some of the parts were miscast. Meatloaf... WHAT THE *insert cuss word here* ?!?! I mean, come on. Would hot naked chicks actually go for Meatloaf? REALLY!?!?! No. I think not. And his expressions were kinda over the top. Michelle Rodriguez overacted terribly to the point I wanted her dead... which Rayne delivered (thank you Rayne). I have seen Michelle Rodriguez in MANY a movie and always disliked her attitude but in this movie with her FAKE accent she couldn't pull off... I just wanted to kill her really. Ben Kingsley wasn't who I think should have played Rayne's father. No. He was too old and too fragile looking to be Kagan. Kagan in the games was stronger and harder and more menacing looking. And seriously, no offense.... but Kingsley can't look that menacing really... not in that fake wig especially. And sorry but the girl who played Rayne... Kristanna Loken, the only movie I have ever seen her in that she did GOOD in was Terminator 3 and that is because she didn't speak. I think someone more dynamic could have played Rayne. Also, too long and too bad of a SEX SCENE there between Rayne and ol' good Non-Vampire dude who's name I never caught at all. John said this movie had too much gore but I didn't think so.

MARTHA'S OVERALL RATING:

I would have to give BloodRayne a 3 star rating simply because it wasn't bad but it wasn't great. I did like it. I didn't feel I wasted my time or money renting it or seeing it. I have seen worse vampire and even worse video game based movies. And what's more... I have seen WORSE Uwe Boll movies (*cough*HOUSE OF THE DEAD*cough*)

So, make up your own Mind about BloodRayne. Follow my instructions above, see it, and draw your own conclusions. I never follow what the OFFICIAL CRITICS say because they blow smoke up their butts and out their mouths. They wouldn't know REAL GOOD movies if they bit them in the bootay.

When it comes to BloodRayne... it actually surprised me. I expected it to be a lot worse... but it was decent.

ALSO NOTE: THIS IS NOT A MOVIE FOR KIDS AT ALL so tuck the kids in. Too much sex, nudity, and blood/gore.",1149206400,6,3594,4.431818181818182
4482083,1,B004V6AISS,"OK, there really is no other way to put this than to say Uwe Boll is terrible.  Seriously, this isn't even campy action/horror where the director knows enough not to take himself seriously.  I think people actually took this film seriously, and that's the scariest part.

The dialogue was awful, the casting was a complete disaster (Michelle Rodriguez in a period piece?!?  NO), and the action scenes, such as they were, were poorly done.

If you can borrow this film, or are a teenage fanboy, go for it.  Otherwise, for the love of God just leave it on the shelf.",1149206400,4,564,4.59
4482084,4,B004V6AISS,"When this movie first came out it wasn't widely promoted and was difficult to find in theaters. When it didn't show up locally the first weekend I had to drive over an hour to Baltimore to see it the second weekend and by the third weekend it was gone even from there so it really hasn't had much of a chance until now with the DVD release.

As a fan of the games, I was excited to hear a movie was being made about Bloodrayne however I was also worried considering how movies based on video games have fared. Many of them have tried to be exactly like a video game or they're trying to sell you something rather than tell you a good story, either way it just doesn't work. I thought Bloodrayne was the best movie adapted from a video game until I saw Silent Hill.

Is it worth checking out? Yes, especially if you like the video games although don't expect it to be just like the game. Like any movie it's got its negative points but I don't think anyone was expecting an Oscar from a movie based on a video game anyway so go in with reasonable expectations. Overall it is a good movie, this unrated directors cut seems to flow a bit better than what I saw in the theater. I do think the movie starts getting better towards the end compared to the beginning, most likely because everyone had become more accustomed to things by then. It's also worth pointing out that this movie had to explain everything. Not everyone in the audience had played the video game so there have to be things put in to become familiar with the characters and their background. This makes it tough because you can't just jump right in you have to build it up first. Maybe that's something from my personal point of view because I already know going in, someone new might not even notice because they're getting the story for the first time and have the chance to grow along with it..

It's a good movie but it leaves me wanting more. Isn't that what all fans want? If you're like me and want to see a sequel or if you want to find out what Bloodrayne is all about for yourself...buying the DVD is the only way to make that happen.",1149120000,2,2109,4.280701754385965

I can't help but feel violated I spent money to watch this.

The plot is pretty standard. The child of some big bad evil creature uses their own powers to turn around and defeat daddy. I liked that plot a LOT better when it was called Star Wars. The fight scenes are pitiful, usually just a chance for the FX department to trot out a few spurting bloody limbs and call it good. The end, if you can even call it that, was the biggest rip-off I have been victim of in quite some time.

I'm glad I didn't pay anything to see this, it's not worth paying for the rental.  Horribly disappointing.........",1149033600,3,565,4.714285714285714
4482089,3,B004V6AISS,"""Bloodrayne"" has received nothing but poor publicity from the moment it hit the big screen.  It's been written off for everything from bad acting, horrible action, and darn-near porn sequences.  However, after watching this flick, I don't really see what all the fuss is about.  Sure, the acting is really bad at times, but I've seen worse in many other flicks.  The action looks pretty good in my opinion, though the blood and gore is actually silly at times.  As far as the porn goes, there's a bunch of naked prostitutes in one sequence who do nothing more than lay around on Meatloaf and Rayne gets a little lovin' on the bars of her cell, but nothing that goes any farther than flicks such as ""Body Heat"" and ""An Officer And A Gentleman"" and, more recently, ""Hostel.""

Many people seem to be turned off by the fact that the movie doesn't follow the video game as closely as they'd like.  ""Resident Evil"" did the same thing, but managed to handle its own story a little better.  ""Tomb Raider"" is better as a game, no matter how nice Angelina Jolie looks in those tight little outfits.

The cast is pretty stiff at times, but I feel that that is primarily due to the fact that the script was rather stiff as well.  Michael Madsen turns in a pretty bad performance as Vladimir, and Michelle Rodriguez is, well, Michelle Rodriguez.  She plays pretty much the same character in every movie she's in, and I'm glad that her role wasn't expanded too much.  Ben Kingsley, who's overrated in my opinion, doesn't have much to do in this flick until the final minutes, in which he delivers his lines in standard Kingsley fashion.  Matt Davis, as Sebastian, delivers a pretty good performance, but the standout is Kristanna Loken as Rayne, who manages to take an iffy character and make her pretty decent to watch on the screen.  Billy Zane has a minor role as Rodriguez' father, but he makes the most of it as he fumbles along nonchalantly as the mortal and immortal worlds collide.

The bloodletting in this flick is borderline silly.  In one particular fight sequence at a monastery (headed by none other than Udo Kier, an underused actor in just about every flick he's in), the blood flows at an unusually high rate.  At certain points, you can actually see the gas used to blow the blood out of the ""bodies"" as each is impaled, hacked, decapitated, and smashed.  However, this is a frequent happening in B-movie action.  It's nothing new to fans of any old school zombie flicks.  What's even funnier is that the main characters get nary a drop of blood on their clothing while the blood is flying.

So why did I give this flick three stars?  For the simple fact that all involved seemed to know that it wouldn't be a great film and some of them, particularly Loken, Zane and Davis, seemed to have fun with it.  Madsen and Rodriguez didn't seem too happy to be there, but they aren't as great at acting as they might think they are.  What's really funny about this flick is that Madsen and Kingsley were in ""Species"" and Davis and Rodriguez were in ""Blue Crush.""  Rodriguez is also a veteran of the video game genre, having been in ""Resident Evil"" before ""Bloodrayne.""  That's quite a bit of trivia for one flick.

If you enjoyed Loken, I suggest picking up ""Dark Kingdom,"" which is a nice step above ""Bloodrayne.""  It's got the whole dragon and sorcery thing going for it, and it's based on an ancient tragedy.

I'll admit that most people will probably not enjoy ""Bloodrayne"" as much as I did, but it isn't as terrible as many have posted here.  It's silly most of the time, stiffly acted, and there's a little more flesh than most video game flicks, but it's worth at least a rental.

In short, ""Bloodrayne"" is an average low-budget action flick based on a video game.  It's not nearly as good as the ""Resident Evil"" flicks, but it suffices.",1148947200,,3840,4.56058394160584

And the blood! This movie has got to have the fakest looking blood ive ever seen...

Tough im giving this movie two stars for its over the top violence. The decapitations and such are so exaggerated and 'funny' looking that its beyond comical. Think of Kill Bill multiplied 20 times...

4482092,1,B004V6AISS,"Maybe his next film can be the story of how I - pissed-off movie-goer forced to suffer thorough a truly bad director's inane and amateurish films - comes to collect the debt by beating it out of said director's a*s!  The epiphany comes when I learn the lesson that it is I who is really at fault because I keep watching this [...]  The message; free will can be a bit*h.

Uwe Boll has often been called an Ed Wood for a new generation.  This would be fine if he would admit what a cruddy director he is and just go the straight cheese route; but he insists on trying to make good movies, so we can't even laugh and the schlock of it all.  Instead we marvel at how poorly he tries to cover up his dreck with good-looking production values, locals, and actors.

In ""House of the Dead"" he was smart enough to get a bunch of hot girls naked for no other reason than to distract the movie's key demographic (video game geek teens) from the fact that everything else about the movie sucked.  Exotic locals and an attractive, albeit untalented, cast not withstanding, the action was directed so poorly, blandly and confusingly that the whole thing was rendered incomprehensible.  The movie was one long yawn of stuff seen a million times before only this time done more ineptly than perhaps ever before.  It was one of the worst films I had ever seen.  Of course, I had not seen ""Alone in the Dark"" yet.  Everything that went wrong with ""House of the Dead"" goes wrong in that POS as well, except this time it was somehow worse because there is a more convoluted plot that wastes even more of the viewer's time, as if the writers are under the impression it is a good story and we care.  The action, bad as was in ""House"" is even lacking here.  And to add insult to injury, this one didn't even have the decency to throw in any gratuitous [...] shots.

And now, Uwe gives us ""Bloodrayne,"" and with it he has crafted sort of a film trilogy from hell.  If anyone has ever indeed sold his soul to the devil the way we have seen in countless stories it must be Mr. Boll.  How this man keeps getting these films into theatres rather than straight to video, not to mention work at all, is beyond me.  He also, somehow, attracts talented actors that would be impressive names in any schlocky horror movie, not to mention one from this guy.  Jurgen Prochnow in ""House of the Dead,"" and in this film we have the Terminatress (Kristana Loken) as well as Michael Madsen (""Reservoir Dogs""), ""Michelle Rodriguez (""S.W.A.T.,"" TVs ""Lost""), Billy Zane (""Titanic""), and, most baffling, Ben Kingsly.  Ben Kingsley!!!  Can you imagine his agent saying, 'Yeah, it's from the acclaimed director of ""Alone in the Dark, do it!'?  Granted a lot of these names tend to toil in low budget fare from time to time, but they are names just the same.  Why they look at these movies and this director and jump on board is beyond me.  His movies are not hits.  They all flop (none has made more than 5 million) and are all panned by critics and those who see them.  So again, why does he get to keep making movies and why do known actors want to make them with him?  This is an even better question to pose to studio execs.  Why do his movies keep going into theatres?!  Why does he get work at all?!  The Devil's got some explaining to do.

""Bloodrayne"" is what you'd get if ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" had a retarded baby.  It may actually earn the faint praise as the best of Boll's films.  That's a bit like calling puke better than [...], but if you have to rank all these abominations, I think this one wins.  It starts out with a nice moody tone and some picturesque cinematography.  But then people start to speak.  The dialogue and performances are atrocious from the get go.  Even by the generally good actors.  Michael Madsen sets the tone right off.  He utters the film's first line as if he's reading it from his hooked on phonics book, and all the other actors follow suit.  Loken is hot, doing something akin to a poor (wo)man's Charlize Therone, and this is a Vampire movie that remembers to supply the blood and [...].  But the action, again, is awful.  Fight scenes are sped up and slowed down and blurred and every other damn trick to cover up their lameness.  Some of the death scenes are fun in an over-the-top comically gory way.  But most of the deformed faces of Vampires are laughably obvious masks and other things that have their heads severed or blood drained are obvious dummies.  Ben Kingsley, whether it is intentional or not, is stuck in pancake make-up and looks laughably awful.  And Meatloaf turns up doing his usual over -the-top performance shtick.  He's the only who seems to realize this thing sucks, so hammy is the way to go.  At least he sucks on purpose, whereas everyone else just sucks.

I can't stress enough that it is the dialog and the awful line readings that really make this unbearable to observe.  I mean, did they bother to reshoot anything before releasing this?!  Second to that are the poorly staged action scenes, and third is the over all sense of blandness that hangs over this thing.  The story just doesn't matter, and is so bad, and every time it comes into play you just wanna grab for the fast-forward button.

So this sounds pretty bad right?  Funny bad, even?  I don't know.  Maybe if you're drunk, but I still say this movie doesn't even warrant a recommendation on the so-bad-its-entertaining scale.  There are those moments to be sure, but because it takes itself so seriously as a whole, the plot pops up and there are long moments of pure, dead screen time.  Stuff is happening but you could care less.  And those stretches ain't funny.

Which brings me back to my recommendation that if Boll is gonna keep making these crapfests he needs to get out of his own way and stop thinking somewhere along the line one of them is gonna be good.  Embrace is inner Ed Wood-ness.  Camp it up, ham it up and just give us the over-the-top junk that is the only reason most people watch movies with titles like ""House of the Dead,"" ""Alone in the Dark,"" and ""Bloodrayne"" to begin with.

He can start with the story I mentioned at the top of this review.  Or something autobiographical perhaps?  The story of his meeting with Beelzebub.  Of course we all know what happens there.  But we don't yet know how it ends...

4482095,5,B004V6AISS,"Yes, you are all correct that the movie does not follow the ""plot"" of the video games.  Then again, let's be honest with ourselves shall we?  We are talking about a video game who's greatest selling device is that of the letters T and A.  Just like the Tomb Raider series.  T and A.  This is not a video game series that invokes intellectual stimulation (another stimulation, yes, but not intellectual).  You watch the main character, Rayne, going around, bouncing around, leaping, climbing, attacking, solving puzzles, and again leaping.  The game itself tends to be rather repetitive, but then again, it is still a fun game.  You do not get the same invocation kind of storyline you would see in either the Silent Hill series or the Final Fantasy series.

The movie itself really is not that bad.  Of course it is a dumb movie with T and A and running around hacking stuff up, people mostly.  What would you expect from a movie based on a video game?  Shakespeare?  Heck, even the plots don't fit with the before mentioned video games, then again, I would have to think that most people probably don't watch and play BR for wisdom teachings (I mean really, the video game even has a cheat code based upon bouncing breasts, how intellectual is that?).  Hardly Shakespeare, even Shakespeare in the park tends to be better.  The movie itself is a fun movie, watch it with friends, watch it to laugh at what is going on, but also watch it because the choreographed action scenes are actually fairly well done.

Poor acting, poor storyline and poor special effects make this a definate B movie.

Theres even a funny part at the end where Rayne is 'recalling' her adventure through the movie and shows her slicing her former circus master's stomach with blood spewing out... and you see the white CO2 compressed air too...

However, no matter how much I try to get past the fact that this is a ""vampire movie"" I am stuck saying this movie is simply terrible.  It seems to be a B movie struggling to be a big picture, and it fails as both.

The major flaws include:

- Weak dialogue... some of the worst I have ever listened to.  Michelle's Rodriguez's fake accent was the worst!  The movie was filled with stilted exchanges that sounded almost like junior high school kids practicing for their first play.

- Weak action ... the stunts were not well orchestrated, the gore was too over the top, and the actors/stuntmen simply lacked energy.

- Weak story ... like many game movies, Bloodrayne assumes the reader has spent many hours playing the game.  These movies only work if the director and screen writer assume the viewer has never seen the game.

- Weak visuals ... The movie should have been much darker and more intense.  It was too well lit even during the night scenes.  These are vampires right???  Sunlight kills them??  Every killing stroke was a huge squirt of blood spraying toward the camera.  I felt myself going numb at the sight of it.  The fight scenes reminded me of the Black Knight from Monty Python and the Holy Grail.  Very few scenes were shot well.

I have seen some truly terrible vampire movies, but when the director embraces the ""camp"" in movies like Fright Night, it works.  There was some talent, the story could have been workable, and there were plenty of beautiful women.  Bloodrayne could have worked with a different director.

I would have expected so much more from actors like Ben Kingsly.  Obviously, even good actors can be sucked into a disaster like Bloodrayne.",1148601600,9,1755,4.593548387096774

This movie is pretty much like the video game where the more blood the better since if you want to see dismemberments and blood, well you'll see plenty here. The actors and actresse are funny as it dies seem in a way that they are half heartedly acting out thier parts. I do have to laugh at one aspect and thats the sex scene in the jail which in a way is a kinda turn on (yeah i'm a sicko but hey, when you tear off clothes why wouldn't you be)? The thing i laugh about and this goes for a lot of movies.... anyone notice this intense sex these two were having lasted like 20 seconds if that? telling you i couldn't be that quick even if you were going to give me a million dollars. I know they didn't want to draw too much into that part of it but honestly they should of. She needs to release tension somehow and can't kill all the time which when watching this movie, thats all that happens 24/7. If you get technical when you see this movie you think that she left the circus and ended the main fight with her father all in 2 days. (theres like only 3 scenes including the ending where something happens diring the daylight). I don't know if it was more of a storyline or character development but you can tell something is severly missing here. Honestly from watching this movie it was to have more blood shed than any movie has ever done before and thats all it is... a glorified bloodbath. Did i like it? yes i did. glad i bought it? yes. would i recommend it to others? hard to say as i have weird taste and well, as i said, this movie highly depends on what you want to see. if you want to see a b-rated movie thats not corny, then yes watch this. if you were expecting a great directed movie with great character development and a story that makes you shocked... well this is based off a videogame and not many of them became blockbusting hits. I would definately rent this first to see if its your taste before you purchase the DVD.

*By the way, did anyone else wonder about the ending? I mean it shows the worst bloodshed of the whole movie and everything but it almost makes no sense. Hopefully if they do make a second one of this movie, it will be better developed and well... just be upped more in all departments. oh and Rayne was casted nicely so she should be kept the same ; >",1148428800,,2467,4.161087866108787

4482108,2,B004V6AISS,"I have a confession to make:

I am a HUGE Uwe Boll fan.

There's no limit to how bad this guy can get.  He claims his heart is in the right place, but all he does to back up that claim is throw poorly constructed one-dimensional characters into a story filled with what he can figure out in rotting SFX, blood-spurts, and completely random gratuitous sex scenes!  The best part is that he doesn't let get ideas like ""exposition"" or ""character development"" get in the way... no, it's a straight through, opening shot-to-closing shot heyday of complete ineptitude!

Thus, it's an entertaining good time... if your mind is in the right place.

Along to share the joke with us are a mixed cast, everyone from the action-movie-star-overmelodramatic Michelle Rodriguez to the thespian Ben Kingsley himself.  You can basically measure each actor's ability in this movie not by how they deal with the material, but how large each one's smirk is throughout the proceedings.  Billy Zane, Michael Madsen, Ben Kingsley, and Meat Loaf all run their lines behind a half-tilted curve of lips, winking at us with their visages, playing a game that Uwe Boll never gets.

The rest of the actors run around spouting one-liners at an incredible rate... when not engaging in another blood-fest.  Hey I got to admit, that blood was ENTERTAINING blood... only it wasn't ""cool"" or ""awesome"" or ""gory"" or ""amazing effects"" or ""interesting"" or ""crazy"" or any of that... just blatantly, aggressively pointless (everything you've come to expect from these movies).  The sex scene was almost as pointless as the one in Alone in the Dark... ALMOST.  There was actually written character development leading up to it in the script, it's just that Boll decided to direct around such a use and just lay the lines out and get right to the guy ripping Kristanna Loken's shirt off.  Compare to Alone in the Dark, where the sex scene literally comes from nowhere, and we see that little Uwe may be improving a bit.  Heck, soon he might make movies that wouldn't offend people if they were straight-to-DVD!

Also, I have to admit: this movie is probably one of the cleanest videogame adaptations, not because it follows the game (I have no idea), but because it literally plays like one watching a videogame.  The dialog and exposition is roughly the level you can find from your local Dungeons and Dragons Dungeon Master... assuming he's a beginning DM, not one of those that actually exploits the intricacies of the game to make an interesting story.  ""There are three artifacts you must find that can form a union!"" says the old gypsy.  Oh boy, harken sires, I hear a quest afoot!  The acting is like that voice-acting you get in videogames: say the line with only the appeal to emotion, and move on.  Like this: This movie CAN be...very good if I...pause between WORDS and ...fluctuate my voice...

I think the shining star of this movie is actually Billy Zane.  For some reason, his role totally works, and he ends up being an interesting character.  Of course that's probably because he only has, like, two scenes, and both of them are as a sarcastic vampire.  A SARCASTIC VAMPIRE!  How can you possibly not act that?!

4482109,1,B004V6AISS,"I rented this film thinking it would be a good mindless action flick to watch over dinner. Sadly, it wasn't even that... this film bottoms out worse than even Ultraviolet.

First off, let me say that I have only watched the ""Unrated Directer's Cut"" edition and not any other versions available. That said, I have yet to ever see a hollywood film of such a thoroughly malodourous calibre, in every conceivable aspect, as this.

Any film that - immediately following the climax and in lieu of a denouement - has almost ten minutes of montage recap consisting purely of every (low-budget) decapitation, disemboweling, squirting artery, blood-spraying torso, blood-drinking, and dismembered body part shot in the entire movie (as if for the sole purpose of explaining the ""Blood"" in the film and game's title) deserves to be avoided like the plague. I (scarasm!) love the shot of the disemboweled corpse on the floor (guts splayed everywhere, immobile, torso half-removed) where the frenzied fighters like flailing idiots are still senselessly hacking at the corpse in the middle of a pitch battle. There was so much senseless gore in this movie that I found myself thrown into uncontrollable fits of laughter. This should give you a clue as to the equally senseless pacing of the film. Then again, the plot is filled with so many holes (and seems so incomplete) that it would be charity to say that there was enough story for there to have been pacing at all. There is absolutely nothing in the film that hangs together properly, in any semblance of good crafting.

The action is poorly executed, immediately recognisable as ripped off from every other action movie, and poorly choreographed. The swordfighting is even worse (and rather slow), seemingly slapped together by 6-year-olds with sticks. Only the climactic fight between Lokken and Kingsley is even half-decently choreographed and somewhat entertaining.

The dialogue could also have been written by children, the acting is flat and unappealing with inconsistent accents - especially from actors you know could have done better - the costumes unoriginal and unconvincing. I still find it odd to hear american accents in the middle of any medieval ""epic"" and I always shall. As for the musical score, it is uncoordinated with the screen action, nor is particularly memorable. The incidental music and the main themes are unsuccessfully experimental, even though you can tell that the composer somewhat sincerely attempted to write a good ""epic"" score to lift up the incredibly poor quality of the film.  Sadly, the score overwhelms the screen action at many a place and runs amok trying to be Wagner, Mahler, and Berlioz at once while forgetting it is supposed to be a film score.

Someone above mentioned the senseless soft-core porn in this film (it's even more soft-core than in Underworld Evolution, and less tactfully filmed) - unless you're looking for soft-core porn involving Kristanna Lokken or Romanian prostitutes, I must reiterate: avoid this film like the plague.",1148342400,5,3033,5.104838709677419
4482110,5,B004V6AISS,"First off, I am a fan of the Majesco Bloodrayne games.  I had been looking forward to the Bloodrayne movie since I saw the preview on the PS2 Bloodrayne 2 disc.  I went to the movie, I was not disappointed.  I bought the unrated DVD, and I am still not disappointed.  I'm reading reviews on here, and I'm suddenly stuck with the concept....that people simply DON'T GET IT.

Here's my rant.

First off, this movie was simply doomed to failure, so says its critics, for the blunt reason that Uwe Boll (House of the Dead) directed, and it INSTANTLY gets a suck rating. (pun intended).  I'm not buying that.  Some people say that this movie is a mindless ripoff of LOTR.... I'm not getting that either.  Swordfighting makes it a Tolkien ripoff?  I think people watching this expected some kind of great Peter Jacksonian epic.

I frankly think that this, for what it is, is the best film Boll has done.  It has action, pretty decent swordplay, decent acting...hell, damn good acting, for what it is.

Let's talk about actors.  I was impressed by Kristanna Loken, I hated her in T3....but she's got chops and can pull off some decent fight scenes.  She's built for the role of Rayne, she can handle the blades and the look.  She doesn't pull off the Rayne one-liners, like the game...but jeez...leave that for the sequel.  She's just starting out here.

Then you have Michael Madsen.  Everyone just loves to crap on him, how he's so wooden and phony.  ""Pulls off another Sin City performance""...one critic has said.  Apparently a critic that has never read Sin City or has a frickin clue.  Madsen is not wooden, he's brooding.  He's a CHARACTER ACTOR, for Pete's sake.  And it's obvious that his character is 'knightly stoic guy.'  And he pulls it off.  He's fatherly and crusaderlike as the leader of the Brimstone Society.

Then, they throw in a lot of surprise roles, just to juice things up.  Michelle Rodriguez drops in to play the crusading hero gone warped.  Ben Kingsley plays Rayne's demented vampire daddy, and shows he's hell with a saber.  Geraldine Chaplin reads the cards as a mystical fortuneteller, Udo 'BY GOD PLAYBOY VAMPIRE' Kier monks it up as a priest guarding a sacred relic...and yes...he does say 'wampires' in this one...classic frickin moment...and last but not least, MEAT LOAF shows up as a degenerate vampire that plays the rocker persona with a bevy of vampirettes...supposedly ACTUAL prostitutes.  Which makes it all the more good.

Oh yeah, you got a lot of people crying and moaning over the 'video gamey' feel of Bloodrayne, about how she gets powerups and weapon upgrades and fights mini-bosses and bosses.  My answer to that....find a frickin movie that doesn't do that.

Yeah, there's violence.  Uncut version has decapitations, stabbings, and impalements that make LOTR look kinda tame in comparison.  And there's all kinds of nudity....from Meat Loaf's prostitute vamps to Loken herself, in a sex scene that rattles a few dungeon doors, if you catch my drift.

All in all, I play the games, I watched it in the theatre, I bought it, and I enjoy it.  It's not Oscar winning....it's probably not gonna change the world and everything in it, but does everything have to?",1148342400,17,3200,4.771897810218978

4482112,2,B004V6AISS,"Video game adaptations have always had a bad name, and not unfairly so... Year after year, bad quality films based on their pixelated counterparts hit the silver screen, earn some dough, and disappear to eternity, offering utter mindlessness and stupidity for an hour and a half. With that said, not all game adaptations are that bad. Personally, I found the Tomb Raider series, especially the first movie, to be not only entertaining but sufficiently satisfying even though it has its own share of at best, minor boo boos. That is where Blood Rayne come short. It comes short of holding up the entertainment, fails miserably in the props and costumes, and does little justice to a fun game. Video game movies usually have sleek style to back it up... Sadly, Bloodrayne failed in that crucial department.

I think its funny, really, to see how star studded the cast is. For me, its unfortunate for the actors to star in such a diabolically bad movie. The story is sufficient to say the most but that is not where the problems lie. The story, no matter how fine it is, was executed poorly because of the screenplay. Choppy moments, bad character build-up, a horrible script, and bad acting plague the story, making it dull and unbearable. The acting, especially, was extra bad because I think the actors were acting unaturally, especially Michelle Rodriguez who was speaking in this sassy accent when I have been always used to hear her say unrefined, straight-up lines in her other movies. The dialogue is just too hard and untappable for us to be entertained.

The effects are another issue. I guess all their budget went to recruiting the actors so they had mediocre visuals. I mean Rayne's outfit is just bad... She didn't seem like the heroine we know in the games. Her pants are even too baggy. Its as though Kristanna went to some costume store and wore that to shooting. The fights, which is crucial to an action movie like this, were not sufficient. They appeared here and there but there was no big deal. There was no moment where we just watched in awe. Even the final battle didn't feel like a final battle but rather, one of those run-of-the-mill fights she has with mere mortals.

As a whole, Bloodrayne was not a successful adaptation. It felt as though I was watching an unfinished movie which could have been good if better screenplay was present and a more fluid script was pitched.",1147219200,10,2399,4.720763723150358

While Ms. Loken is attractive, senseless softcore porn is not what i wanted. If I had wanted that i have a computer here at home.

Secondly, as an actor, and one who is stuck doing live performances or low budget college films for now, i have to wonder WHAT HAPPENED TO BEN KINGSLEY?! This is a man whom I admire and idolize for his works like Ghandi and House of Sand and Fog...Why in all the cosmos would he decide to take part in this? Must've been one hell of a paycheck for Ben, Mike, and Michelle.

Thirdly, Dr Boll needs to put all those vast financial resources of his to a better use. Why in the world does he need to make more films? Why doesnt he give the money to charity. Hell, with the money he's lost on House of the Dead and Alone in the Dark($35 million) he couldve donated to who knows how many charities and allowed them to further their causes in innumerable ways.

I can enjoy a crappy horror film, I can enjoy bad acting, as either of the two can often be humerous, such as in Bruce Campbell's Man with the Screaming Brain. it was MADE to be crappy and MADE to be funny in its cheesiness. This movie has no such benevolent intent. It was made, SERIOUSLY, as an actual horror/action film and failed horrendously. For those of you who don't realize it, a few THOUSAND(not million, thousand) dollars could easily make something of a higher quality than Dr Boll's lovely masterpiece here...and I use the word masterpiece with sarcasm dripping from every pore upon my flesh.

If this man continues making movies, the online petition won't be enough, we'll have to fly to Germany and have a protest outside his house/mansion/villa/etc. I feel sorry for the actors in this movie as this thing will act as a permanent stain on their very souls, not just their careers.

His most recent flick was Alone in the Dark starring Christian Slater and Tara Reid that had a brief theater run before being rushed out on video. Since Boll is planning on producing movies based on popular video games such as Dungeon Siege, Far Cry, and Hunter: The Reckoning. In order to make these movies in time to cash in on their popularity, Boll is doing rush jobs in producing these motion pictures.

Now, Boll is out with a vampire flick called BloodRayne based on a video game of the same name. This flick boasts Ben Kingsley in its cast, but the level of acting in this movie is uniformly bad. The script is cliched and just plain awful. This is  the single worst movie of 2006 thus far.",1147046400,7,806,4.476190476190476
4482116,1,B004V6AISS,"Kristanna Loken, probably best known for her killing machine role in `Terminator 3,' is the titular Rayne, a vengeful `dhampir' (half human, half vampire) who is determined to kill the vampire king Kagan played by Oscar winner Sir Ben Kingsley. The supporting cast includes Billy Zane, Michelle Rodriguez, Matthew Davis, Michael Madsen, Will Sanderson, Meat Loaf, Michael Pare, Udo Kier and Geraldine Chaplin. These names, though admittedly not completely A-list, are still impressive enough, and with the deft hand of director who knows how to tell a good story, the film could be an entertaining action, if not the greatest movie of the year.

No such luck here, for the film is directed by Uwe Boll, whose totally inept filmmaking reminded me of one legendary director Edward Wood Jr. and his `Plan 9 From Outer Space.' There is no consistent tone or logics behind his storytelling, and no reasonable editing can be found in the sword-fight sequences in `BloodRayne' in which we must be satisfied with some so-so images of Romania, the choppily edited incomprehensible `stunts,' and occasional blood splattering.

It is very sad to see these professional actors doing only half-hearted works. Most actors especially Madsen, Rodriguez, and Kingsley are doing the laziest work in their career, as if sleepwalking in the set. Perhaps they were, dreaming of the paycheck. Loken's character is certainly sexy, but her stilted acting with her eyes wide open is much worse and annoying than Milla Jovovich in `Resident Evil.'

I don't know why, but some directors are so lucky that they can find their jobs after making TWO fiascos. I am talking about Mr. Uwe Boll, German director of this film, who previously made two awful based-on-video-game films, namely `House of the Dead' and `Alone in the Dark.' If the baseball rules should apply to filmmaking, `BloodRayne,' another terrible horror film, should be the three-strikes-and-you're-out film for him.

Toss in a full-fledged video game so that people go ""hmmm, 20 bucks for a movie AND a game?  What a deal!"" and they can recoup some of their losses.  Because if you were to buy the PC game separately, you're looking at spending $30.  Coincidence?  I think not.

Hollywood realized a few years back that some videogames can make really good movies for a number of reasons including that there is already a fan base installed from the VG itself. With that being said its not hard to see why most of them fail horribly.

Here is a tip for Hollywood: Just because a movie is about a videogame character does not mean that you can ignore all of the basic principals on how to make a decent film. You need a good script, you need a good director, you need good performers, You need a good cinematographer, you need a good score etc....  From my experience in viewing movies made from videogames, and I have seen most of them, there seems to be this serious lack in quality that is present in other genres of  film. Its almost like they get lazy because they are dealing with a character that has already proven to be popular and obviously somewhat successful.

Bloodrayne could have been a much better movie than it is plain and simple. The only good thing about this film is Kristanna Loken. She is just so strikingly beautiful that the scenes she is in are at least somewhat bearable just from her apperance alone. Its the age old power of beauty. That being said everything else about this movie is a joke. The cinematography was mediocre, The fight scenes were incredibly simplistic & the dialogue could have been written by a 12 year old film student. This combined with absolutly horrid directing by the now infamous Uwe and piss poor acting even by the somewhat decent actors like Ben Kingsley have ranked this videogame movie right at the bottom of the list.

If you absolutly love vampires and absolutly love looking at beautiful women on screen then by all means see this movie for a few hours of brainless entertainment, otherwise do yourself a favor and avoid this movie at all costs.

But I was given an advance copy of Bloodrayne, and I gotta say, it's his best work. Though that really isn't saying much. Yeah, it's low budget, but the guy finances his own movies. Thats why he is able to get virtually any video game licsense he wants. These game companies want money, most of them don't care about the quality of the movie. Thats why they make budget price games. It's all about the benjamins. Anyhoo. If any one except Boll made this movie, there would not be half of the bad reviews that there are. Sure, there has been way better vampire action flicks, but this one does hold it's own weight. Substantial blood and guts, resonable storyline, and pretty good battle scenes. As for the fanboys(and girls) who say it has nothing to do with the game, IT'S A PREQUAL! It's a shame that this movie got critically hammered because it could have made a good franchise. And leave the actors alone. Since when could Micheal Madsen act(Species? Thats Oscar caliber!!)? Michelle Rodriguez is hot, but she should probably stick to Lost. The only actor worth a damn in this was Ben Kingsley. But still, it's a good movie. I enjoyed it. I say if you're a fan of the genre, check it out. It's something different. One final note.....I noticed that there are a lot of reviewers crying about the lack of realism in Bloodrayne.......A. IT'S A VAMP MOVIE!!!!! B. You can't get much more real than hiring real romainian prostitutes for a specific scene. Not a five star, but a good rent.",1142035200,10,1653,4.422950819672131

Well, how do you explain a movie like ""BloodRayne"" otherwise? The infamous Boll's new film is yet another example of cinematic ineptitude, with bad acting from B-list stars, an atrocious script, and a plot that is actually thinner than the original video game. Someone put this movie out of its misery.

Rayne (Kristanna Loken) is a dhampir -- half human, half vampire, the result of a vampire raping a human. Escaping from a life as a sideshow freak, she decides to go kill her daddy Kagan (Sir Ben Kingsley). And Kagan is trying to grab the magical body parts of an ancient vampire, which will make him invincible.

Since Rayne is a good bloodsucker (animals and bad guys) she happily joins a band of vampire-haters, the Brimstone Society. Vladimir (Michael Madson), Sebastian (Matt Davis) and Katarin (Michelle Rodriegez) join forces with Rayne. But to stop Kagan, they will have to deal with his vicious vampire hordes.

If ""Buffy"" had ripped off ""Blade"" and ""Lord of the Rings,"" then the result might have been something like ""BloodRayne."" Yes, the film is that unoriginal -- Uwe Boll tears off chunks of hit movies, and splatters them together into a movie of his own. But it cannot hide this simple fact: Boll has the skills of a mentally backward Yorkie.

Well, Boll is trying hard. He really, really tries hard to make this a thrilling, stunning adventure. But the entire movie is strangled in his ineptitude -- the action is Monty Pythonesque at best, with silly wrangling and geysers of blood. Lots of dismemberment. Funny sex against the jail bars. It's all almost campy, but somehow it's too inane to be.

And the cast is the worst. To put it simply, most of the actors seem like escapees from a vampire porn movie, wearing grimy costumes and bad wigs. You know a movie is in trouble when Romanian prostitutes -- real prostitutes -- are more impressive thespians than the lead actress. And if this is medieval Romania, how come everyone is naked?

Kristanna Loken proves why she has had no major roles besides a robot, and Michelle Rodriegez plays the Antisocial Bad Girl again. And the two good actors, Ben Kingsley and Michael Madson, are left to wallow in the cinematic gook. I felt genuinely sorry for these two guys, since they will probably be fielding the question ""Why did you do BloodRayne?"" for the next twenty years.

This version includes ""Bloodrayne 2,"" but it's not clear why -- the movie and the second video game have virtually nothing to do with one another.

4482134,1,B004V6AISS,"Where do I begin? This movie was the biggest disappointment I've seen since Blade 3. I'm a fairly big fan of the game, but this movie was terribly acted, terribly written, terribly composed, and lacked action. The director seemed to think that no one would notice the actors lack of weapons training and fight choreography with flashy camera work, close ups instead of wide angles, and some kind of strobe effect that looked horrible. The only fight worth your time was between Michelle and Kristanna. There is one move from that game that she uses during her fight with Ben Kingsley, but bloodrage is introduced once and never used again throughout the whole movie. Just when you think she may go into a fit of bloodrage, you realize that she's just horny and wants sex. The cinematography is horrible. The script seems like it was written by a fifteen year old. The only actor who did anywhere near a decent job was Michelle Rodriguez. The music was so bad, words cannot describe it. I really don't think that the composer even saw the film at all. It didn't match ANYTHING that was going on in the film.

The story had no direction. I'm blaming the director for this one, who is now on my list of the worst directors of all time. The story starts with no real beginning. Rayne is in her twenties and suddenly decides that she wants revenge against her father. What was she doing in the mean time??? Along the way are some vampire relics that help make her stronger and a band of vampire hunters that join her. That's it! There is no story. Rayne has absolutely no character development or personality to her, none of the cast did, except Michelle Rodriguez. Ben Kingsley is not menacing or scary at all as the lord vampire.

This is a movie for guys! Rayne is weak and male dependent. She gets her butt kicked until Michael Madsen, who by the way does such a horrible acting job I have no idea how he gets work, and her boyfriend come to save her. Not to mention the 10 minute long sex scene where Kristanna Loken's boobs bounce around for no reason whatsoever. Just once I would like to see a movie about a female heroine directed by a butch male hating lesbian. I want my heroine to be perfectly capable of kicking a man's ass without crying for her boyfriend to come save her every five minutes.  Or a movie starring a female heroine that doesn't have her breasts parading around the screen.  I DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT!

It really felt like the director had no idea what the hell he was doing. And I say HE because there is NO WAY a woman directed this. The sex scene kept going on and on and on and the only naked people you see in the whole film are females. They end up at Meatloaf's brothel for god's sake. They really had no idea how to end this movie. It just ended.

4482137,1,B004V6AISS,"More of a boisterous, lumbering enigma than anything, `Blood Rayne' solidifies German director Uwe Boll as possibly the most inept director of our age.  He has lost 9,000,000 and 26,000,000 dollars respectively with his last two movies.  This, his latest epic -uninspired, gratuitous, and a staggering commercial failure- will probably lose even more impressively.

Just how does he do it?
There is an interesting theory going around, citing Boll as a savvy con artist (due to a loophole in the German tax-funded film industry, commercial failures such as these CAN, under certain situations, prove financially beneficial... for Boll at least).

Whatever his motivation, Dr. Uwe Boll is either the worst director in modern times, or the sleaziest... or both.

Zero stars.

4482139,3,B004V6AISS,"Before I start, I dislike Uwe Bolls film making just as much as any one else in this world ! I am not here to defend him or to say that he is great! But I have watched alot of bad movies in my time and some were considered Blockbuster's ! I can say with a straight face this isn't the worst I have seen ! His previous two films were unbareable ! This one is watchable and some what interesting to some extent !

Now the review !

 I have to honestly say I was a bit surprised ! I actually enjoyed this movie. Considering the source it wasn't bad at all ! After watching the painful ""Alone in the Dark"". I didn't think it was possible for Dr Boll to make anything of any substance. This movie had a atmophere to it. And a very interesting cast which I found quite amuzing ! And to be honest, I enjoyed this much more than what most people consider blockbuster's ! Because I look for interesting and obscure titles ! I guess u can say I am a indie movie lover !

For starters Kristanna Loken was a excellent choice for the main character. Kristanna is just simply gorgeous, every since Terminator 3 I just thought she was just the sexiest thing ever ! Not to mention she is Bi and almost 6 feet tall ! She exuded alot of power in this movie just as she did in T3. Michelle Rodriquez was an interesting character but seemed abit out of place. Her accent seemed abit forced. U could definitley tell it wasn't natural. Micheal Madsen, Oh boy he looked like he had came off of a month drunk benge ! He had zero expression in his lines and he acted as if he didn't care much about anything ! He kept the same expression throughout the whole movie. And kept repeating "" We have work to do "". Billy Zane was just silly and had one of the worst Wigs I have ever seen in Hollywood History ! His character was pointless he was the father of Michelle R's character, Isn't that something ? Meatloaf, I guess he was some type of vampire Pimp of some sort which was a bit uproarious !

Some of the Props looked fake like for instance the Swords? Oh my ! They looked as if they were aluminium and retangle shaped instead of sharp and pointed ! Oh my, and some of the lines LOL , for instance. Rayne was locked up in Prison and she was angry, this is what she had to say ? "" I will do what I have to do, I want u to know that what ever it takes, I won't stop fighting for a second"". Then some superhero music started playing and they all stood up ! LOL ! Boy ,Oh boy ! was that entertainment ! But for the record this movie isn't nearly on the level of Dr Boll's previous Two efforts NO NO ! This is actually watchable and enjoyable to a huge extent! If u are looking for a movie to just entertain you and not take it seriously, this is the one ! This is good campy fun at best, and action packed as well ! The fight sequences were a bit redundant ! And u could tell that he was trying to hide alot of the flaws. By using camera trick work and panning during the fight sequences ! But over all this movie is a hell of alot better than ""Blade Trinity, Godson and Queen of the Damned"" ! Now these, were consider to be major releases and they sucked ! At least this movie had atomophere and was filmed in a beautiful setting ! And it isn't trying to be something it is not ! It is just what it is ""Cheese""and a unique movie in its own right ! Blade and Queen where just garbage ! I thought that there was somewhat of an imaginative effort put into this ! Bloodrayne definitley could have been done alot better from another director. But coming from the source this was not bad ! And I honestley say this is as good as it gets from Dr boll, unfortunatley ! Why did this work for him somewhat ? He had great game material to start with and a sexy lead ! But in all honesty, the game is much better ............

4482140,1,B004V6AISS,"Uwe Boll, as always, sucks royally at making movies be even slightly entertaining.  He doesn't know how to make a good movie, as it pertains to horror movies, I feel.  The proof is just by watching it all unfold like I did.  If I saved the ticket price to do something more fun, it wouldn't leave such a bad taste in my mouth.

The story opens up in a castle, but its' so obvious that it's nothing more than a theme park attraction, it's hardly scary.  The dialects of the natives are so horridly done, it's tough to decide where they are at all.  Most of the story after that is just a lot of cheesy dialog & Western-styled shooting that looks like it was filmed from an arcade game.

The camera work sucks as always with Boll's cheesy projects in movies.  It looks like a 3-year old could've done better with it.  Most of the time, the camera angles are wrong for the shot or the actors aren't shown in a way that makes them look good.  Sometimes, they look just like blips on a radar screen.  The music seems out of place also, the soundtrack & background music for it are worse than most direct to videos around.

The only pro is that Uwe Boll did a quasi-decent job of getting some big name stars on the screen.  Every thing else of the flick reeks like a movie that'd make direct to video horror movies look like Casablanca.",1136851200,13,1330,4.272
