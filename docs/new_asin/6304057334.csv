But lets get one thing straight from the out, the animation in average, but this isn't important. Its the incredible  story that sets this out from the many other so-so better looking Manga  films. Over the series you become deeply fond of the four brothers who are  slowly turning into dragons. Also the way the governments try to maniulate  the brothers is a very subtle way of depicting of how governments in  general are trying to control peoples' lives. This is an excellent piece of  Manga that will appeal to new fans to the genre as much as hardcore fans.",962582400,3,671,4.5966386554621845
