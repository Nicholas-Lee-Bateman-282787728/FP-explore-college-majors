7453972,4,B015XIH8A8,I thought the film makers did a fine job. It was moving and informative. It depicted a well rounded perspective of WYHS life. Worth the watch. I recommend watching this for young people entering the selective enrollment process. FYI: I saw it at a screening.,1452384000,,258,4.7555555555555555
7453973,5,B015XIH8A8,"I grew up around Chicago and it's common knowledge the challenges that CPS faces, and this documentary really shows how far people are willing to go to get themselves and their children a chance. I thought the filmmaking and the editing was good, and it taught me a lot.",1472515200,,270,4.530612244897959

7453978,5,B015XIH8A8,"Amazing. I grew up near Chicago and lived in the city for almost twenty years as an adult, and I didn't really understand the system of selective enrollment until I watched Selected. I enjoyed it and was moved by it. I especially liked how families were shown from different socio-economic backgrounds, and that the focus was that they all just wanted what is best for their children. Amazing",1462579200,,392,4.779411764705882
7453979,5,B015XIH8A8,"Great documentary featuring an extraordinarily school, and the issues surrounding public education.",1457136000,,99,7.333333333333333

7453981,4,B015XIH8A8,"Just saw this in the theater. A warm and uplifting look at one of the few high schools that really gives non--rival edged kids a chance to excel.the filmmakers show the pressure as well, and not all the students can handle it. Full disclosure: my children went to the high school depicted. The film makers nailed the atmosphere of the school, it gets a bit over the top at times and no high school experience is that perfect, but this school really delivers what is promised in this film.",1454716800,,488,4.49438202247191
7453982,1,B015XIH8A8,"The ""Nike"" movie was slow and boring and full of racial and sexist ideas and images from start to the end. If you want movie that shows desperation of the those who own America then this is the Movie for you.",1454630400,,208,4.097560975609756
8735052,5,B015XIH8A8,"I see this ""movie"" every day because both of my daughters are fortunate enough to attend Whitney M. Young Magnet High School. Our family was on that crazy odyssey that is known as educating your children in Chicago; we went from private schooling (elementary)  to home schooling (middle school)  to Selective Enrollment (high school). I think this film captures the anxiety and the exhilaration that comes with the journey.",1497225600,,423,5.115942028985507
8735053,5,B015XIH8A8,"A thoughtful, well-rounded review that not only shows and pros and cons of competitive magnet schools, but encourages us to think about how to lessen the gap between them and underachieving ""normal"" public schools.",1489363200,,214,5.323529411764706
8735054,4,B015XIH8A8,"The issue with Charters and Magnet schools who are brand new, and trying to recreate this type of dynamic is that it creates lower enrollment at our public schools; which in turn equals closures. If we could put this much passion in our existing public schools for reform, the outcome would be amazing. The teacher that said ""the good students leave and go to these magnet schools, creating a loss for the other local schools"" hit the nail on the head.",1489017600,,452,4.592592592592593
8735055,5,B015XIH8A8,"This is one of the better education documentaries that I have seen.  I especially like how they mentioned the history of the school Whitney Young and interviewed founding teachers Jay Lee and Melanie Wojtulewicz.  I'm surprised they didn't mention that Michelle Obama is a graduate.  They also should have mentioned that five percent of the seats may be filled by principal's discretion, which may factor into why Whitney Young has such a winning basketball team.

I'm glad that they showed that highly rigorous schools are not for everyone, and no, we don't always need more schools like this.  But a school like this does have its place.

Niko being in a gifted program and not getting into Young may be explained by his family's address.  Thirty percent of students are admitted solely on their scores.  The other 70 percent are divided into income tiers based on their address.  The more affluent tiers are more competitive.  I'm just surprised that Niko didn't seem to have chosen a second selective school, especially one were closer to his home.  But, he seemed to be happy staying with the gifted program.

There is another documentary on Chicago specialized high schools that is called Central Standard On Education and it is available on YouTube.  The film focuses on the eight graders, their current schools, and several of the specialized schools that they were considering.",1482278400,3,1386,5.0
8735056,4,B015XIH8A8,"Enjoyed the story line. Interesting perspective on something I didn't know about. The story was a bit too biased towards the high school in the documentary, but they did touch on some other similar Chicago-area schools.",1482192000,,219,5.111111111111111
8735057,2,B015XIH8A8,"Had to watch this movie for a class I'm taking. Couldn't get through the trailer, so I put on music and skipped through the movie stopping at parts where text was so I can know who's who for my test.",1481760000,,199,4.0

8735059,5,B015XIH8A8,"Really good look at a highly competitive and very diverse high school in Chicago.  The kids were endearing, troubled and enthusiastic by turn.  It's a great look at high school today.  Highly recommended.",1477699200,,204,5.121212121212121
8735060,3,B015XIH8A8,"Waiting for Superman was more interesting, yet the filmmakers were in the right place at the right time with their story for what happened to some of these kids.",1477526400,,161,4.586206896551724
