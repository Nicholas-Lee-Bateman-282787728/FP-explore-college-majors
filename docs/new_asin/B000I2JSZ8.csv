I am so disappointed with this movie. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY like I did. It's next stop is the dump after I smash it with a hammer. I had to rate this movie in order to proceed with this review. I want to give it NO rating at all but since I had to, my rating would go only to the actor. The guy who plays Sawyer from the series Lost, should stay on the Lost series. Wish I had my money back on this one........",1210377600,,585,3.80327868852459
2652836,1,B000I2JSZ8,"The front cover suggests that this will be a high-action western.  Instead, it moves slow and has much fake fighting and tedious antagonisms.  The back cover shows the sexy torso of a semi-nude man.  However, this film has a flash of female nudity and no male nudity.  Finally, though the covers show young people, this film is really about middle-aged, graying cowboys.  This movie is for the ""Space Cowboy"" crowd, rather than the ""Quick and Dead"" crowd.  Beware when renting or viewing this work.",1167868800,8,498,4.869047619047619
8143741,1,B000I2JSZ8,"Wow. This has to be one of the worst movies ever made. I bought it because it was cheap and I had just watched Lost, so I was basically getting it for Josh Holloway. Even though his name is on the top of the cover, he's only in it for about the first 20 minutes. Then it moves forward in time and it's a bunch of other people - nobody you've ever heard of.

It's not that the acting is horrible - although it isn't spectacular. It's pretty much all about the awful writing and lack of a plot - or more accurately, too many competing plots to the point of not knowing what the story is really supposed to be about. It's quite confusing and just not well written.

This movie is not worth watching...ever...under any circumstance.",1408492800,,728,4.268115942028985
8143742,4,B000I2JSZ8,"The movie is low budget, that is true. But if you like Josh Holloway, there is more than enough footage of him in this to justify the price. The scene of him singing alone is worth the low price of this DVD.",1386806400,,207,3.9523809523809526
8143743,5,B000I2JSZ8,"So when this movie was being made, I was living in a small town in Alabama.  The movie was using a location nearby to film some scenes and through some lucky turn of events I got to be involved, although in a small way.  I was a horse trainer (among other things) at the time and this being a western(ish) movie they had horses.  With horses comes a need to take care of said horses.  I along with a few other people did just that.  It was such a great time working with all the people and seeing a sort of behind the scenes aspect of movies, even if it happens to be a ""low budget"" movie.  I even got to be in the movie as an extra and as a ""stunt double"" if you want to call it that.  I ran on the horse in place of one of the actors.

It was a great time spent with great people.  You should buy this movie if for no other reason than to support the awesome people that put so much time and effort into making it a reality.",1378425600,,926,3.857142857142857
8143744,2,B000I2JSZ8,"not a good movie..not really bad though. I just bought it fir Josh Holloway. I knew his was a miniscule role, but i still bought it. Its kinda bore. My sister got bored, got up and went away just in less then 10 min. i tolerated the movie just becoz it was a Holloway movie. What i found out was that the movie actually got better when the younger cowboys are replaced by their older counterparts. 15min. into movie, the story jumps to 30yrs ahead. But overall it is not something that 'You have to Watch before You Die'. you can live without watching it.
There is no Kick-ass action stuff as the Tagline ""Never Cross A Cowboy"" suggests. There is no running wild in the lawless West. There is no 'Beat the Odds' stuff in the movie as the description of the movie suggests. It actually turns out to be a comedy movie, which fails to evoke any laughter. And it doesn't have a English subtitle and i had a hard time understanding the Actors' fake Accent.
Oh and yes, The DVD cover boasts of Josh Holloway's images both on front and back..but he is there for merely 10-15min. Obviously the Production Company tried to milk Josh Holloway's Popularity post LOST.
oh, and btw, there is a bonus feature where The Director Talks about Josh.
Pheww.. they'd do anything to milk his popularity. Josh should ask for Commission from them for using his Post Lost popularity to sell his pre-lost movie. and Btw Josh was looking really smart in that Bonus Video. In the same Video, Josh has been shown to play a guitar and sing, and the director claims that he is a good singer. Trust me, another gimmick. I don't know if he can play guitar, but the voice was definately not his. He was just doing Lip-sync.
So Buy it only if you are a Huge HOlloway fan, and don't care for your money. But if you do care for every penny you spend, and you are still a huge holloway fan, avoid buying it, and rather download Josh's scenes in the movie from YouTube.",1300320000,,1931,4.381615598885793
8143745,1,B000I2JSZ8,"Mi Amigo, made in 1998, is a movie of staggering awfulness, and should be seen by anyone who appreciates cinematic abortions.  Intoxicants are suggested for optimum enjoyment.",1288915200,,175,5.481481481481482
8143746,5,B000I2JSZ8,THIS IS A PRETTY GOOD MOVIE.IT WAS GOOD TO SEE ED BRUCE IN ANOTHER MOVIE.,1265155200,,73,3.933333333333333
8143747,4,B000I2JSZ8,"I am sick and tired of these people complaining about this movie! You know what, it may not be the Best movie in the world, but it was (atleast for me) Fun to watch. And so what if the plot did not make much sense it has good acting and is not that bad! If you don't mind super cheesy movies that don't make much sence, you should try it, but if you are a negative, closed-minded jerk that buy something else!

--The end!!!",1264118400,,423,4.035714285714286
8143748,1,B000I2JSZ8,"Doesn't even deserve 1 star. Boring, no plot. When the cowboys return after 30 years, they are completely different actors that don't even resemble the ones that left.  So low-budget they couldn't even hire a make-up person??  JUST AWFUL.",1236556800,5,238,5.076923076923077
8143749,1,B000I2JSZ8,"I love Josh Holloway, and if anybody was ever born to play an Old West  cowboy, it's him. So I settle in to feast my eyes for 90 minutes and instead I can barely force myself to watch the whole thing. First of all it's not Old West, it's modern day Texas, and Josh Holloway is only in the beginning. It very quickly flash forwards to the ""present"" when they are supposed to be 30 years older - one looks about 50, the other one has to be 70. The plot is totally non-existant - WHO WRITES THIS STUFF AND WHO THINKS IT'S A GREAT IDEA TO ACTUALLY WASTE MONEY MAKING IT? The two guys break up their frienship because one goes swimming with the other one's girl (huh?) and one goes to Nashville to become a star and the other one (Josh) goes to Hollywood to become a big Western star (really? in 1989?), all off-screen thank God. Then they come back to their little Texas hometown and make up. It is absolutely painful to watch. If this was made in 2006 Josh Holloway was already well known from Lost - how could he be involved in somthing like this? I'm guessing it was made before Lost and only released later. If you're thinking you'll see much of Josh you'll be very disappointed. Even if you don't know who Josh Holloway is and just expect to see a decent movie you'll be very disappointed! Unbelievably bad.",1235174400,3,1308,4.295546558704453
8143750,1,B000I2JSZ8,"THIS MOVIE IS A WASTE OF A DVD.  Do not buy this movie, even if just for the Josh Holloway footage.  It is the story of 2 Amigos, but after the first 20 minutes, the movie ""fast forwards to today"" and the guys are OLD.  No plot, no beautiful locations, even the skinny-dipping scene is lame.  Do not waste your money.",1216944000,,317,4.147540983606557
