8611457,3,B00F1BFLMA,"Decent series. I got it after watching it on Netflix and they took it off. However reason I didn't give it 4 stars isn't because of the content but because the disc has 2 flaws, 1, I think critial and the other an annoyance. The annoyance, is at the beginning and end of each episode is an commerical from breville. I can see why this would be since it's PBS and they need funding. The flaw one though I thought should have been there is a play all button. You need to individiually select each episode to watch rather than just autoplaying them. This seemed to me like a no brainer to have as an option.",1484006400,,604,4.2155172413793105
