4605466,5,B0058YPISW,Fox is crazy for cancelling The Finder...It's one of the best shows out there...I hope someone else picks it up...,1337558400,55,114,4.75
4605637,5,B0058YPISW,"Fire the Execs at Fox for not making a second season. What moron at Fox canceled this?
No doubt he canceled the series to keep The Finder from letting us know his/her name!
The Finder is super entertainment. Wild, zany, and sheer entertainment. If you love
mysteries with great plots, acting, and spell binding entertainment, this is it. The character development
and dynamics make each episode a pure delight. Light and refreshing in the genre of Burn Notice,
this series is well worth the price of admission. Congrats to amazon for making this series available.
Love the series - love the acting - love the plots - love each episode.
5 Stars all the way!!!!!!!!!!!",1344124800,7,666,4.8
4605638,5,B0058YPISW,"The Finder is a great show about Walter Sherman, a man who can find anything, and the unique and quirky characters and friends populating Walter's life.  Most everyone on the show is interesting, and complex, not standard cut-out characters.  The weekly guest stars always bring a good time to the show with their portrayals, and the conventional problems they need Walter's help in solving, usually involving something very unconventional.  The writing is fresh, and the story in each episode moves smoothly.  The Finder is definitely not a one-note, predictable show, instead it is always interesting.  Or, it was until Fox canceled it.

The Finder was originally a back-door pilot on the television series Bones.  The show's tie to Bones was tenuous at best.  Loosely based on a couple of books by Richard Greener, The Finder languished while shackled broadcast time-wise to Bones.  Fox TV seemingly expected Bones' viewing audience to immediate take to The Finder, even though the two shows are very different.  Fox moved The Finder away from Bones, and The Finder found its audience.  Even so, the show is still canceled.

Fox TV seems like a network with a penchant for canceling good (and sometimes great) television shows because, well, I have no idea why.  Maybe Fox wants to see how many viewers they can alienate.  Perhaps Fox wants to set a record in having the most TV series that develop a cult following because Fox canceled the series.  With Firefly, and more recently, Alcatraz, Terra Nova, and now The Finder, becoming attached to a Fox TV series can be a heart-breaker of an undertaking.

I hope The Finder gets a new home, while maintaining the same quality of the stories, and the actor's portrayals.  I also hope we are not left hanging, waiting for the release on disc of The Finder, season one.

My best wishes for Michael Clarke Duncan's continued recovery.

eta: September, 2012
Rest in peace, Mr. Duncan.",1343433600,6,1931,4.922600619195046
4605639,5,B0058YPISW,"Fox cancels Human Target and now The Finder. Really enjoyed this show. I agree that it was funny, had plenty of action and well developed characters. We were getting to know them better and the actors seemed to have a real good chemistry. Fox seems intent on driving viewers to alternate programming. For me now there is still Burn Notice, Falling Skys, Leverage, White Collar, Covert Affairs, Grimm , Supernatural to name a few. Oh right! Different networks. Now with House gone all that is left for me is Saturday baseball,Bones and Fringe(last season).( I hope I didn't jinx Bones) At least release the DVD soon for this and Human Target season 2. Anyone else fed up. Hey wasn't Moonlight on Fox also? (viewers choice award for new programming a few years ago. 1 season.)",1343260800,7,774,4.7407407407407405
4605640,5,B0058YPISW,"Here is a show that can skillfully mix comedy, action, a little drama, and heart-felt moments all into one episode. It's a show that can be a procedural without the viewer ever losing interest because the stories are so unique and different than any thing else on TV. The show is well written and PERFECTLY cast. It is everything I have ever wanted a show to be, quirky, yet intelligent, funny and engaging...I just wish there were more than 13 episodes. Great show!!!",1342742400,6,468,4.650602409638554
4605641,5,B0058YPISW,I was in love with this show when it was featured on Bones! After watching that episode I was ecstatic when I heard that they were planning a spin off show. I was heartbroken when I heard the show was cancelled! Someone pleasempleaseplease pick up this show! It's awesome!,1342569600,3,272,4.571428571428571
4605642,5,B0058YPISW,"Why not? well, the show itself really is a must see, a breath of fresh air if you will. But Fox decided to cancel it, baffling decision to say the least. So warning to all of you, don't start watching because you will get hooked and there is only few episodes with no season 2 in sight just yet.

Apart from that ""minor"" problem, the show itself is great, easy going, great characters, witty with interesting stories. Well worht seeing if you can live with 13 episodes.",1342569600,3,469,4.390804597701149
4605643,5,B0058YPISW,"The Finder is a gem of a television show.  It reminds me a bit of the show Psych in its lighthearted fun. The characters are a little quirky while lovable and the writing is amazing. I think it was perfectly cast and each episode had fun new plots lines while also managing to continue telling the story of the main characters Walter, Wila, Isabel, and Leo. And can anyone else appreciate how it wasn't just dripping with sex in each episode like so many popular shows? I am sad how most tv shows today are trashy ""reality"" shows, melodramatic sitcoms in hospitals or law firms, or children's programming. I really wish this show would be renewed. We need more quirky, witty, lighthearted shows on TV. BRING BACK THE FINDER! [...]",1342483200,2,730,4.615384615384615
4605644,5,B0058YPISW,"Fox was absolutely CRAZY to cancel The Finder!!!  We thought it was the best new show we've seen in years - on any network. It totally held my attention (and my husband's too) every minute of every show. Walter was so quirky - you never know what he would do and the rest of the cast was just as good, But Walter MADE the show. Aside from Bones, we hardly watch any Fox shows - there just aren't that many good ones. And I personally am SO over reality and game shows. They're BORING because I really don't want to watch peoples' ""lives"" or watch people compete for anything (think Hell's Kitchen, etc) ! I think they're just cheap, no writers needed, no imagination needed to actually write scripts to entertain people - and that's what we look for - entertainment. The Finder was definitely that. I think the networks are dumbing the programming down which is insulting.

Thank you to the Finder's writers for coming up with such a special show and the actors for doing such a great job. I REALLY wish it'd get picked up by a smarter network that understands it may take a little while for a new show to grow it's fan base (although I was hooked after seeing the Finder episode on Bones).

We will miss the Finder greatly. At LEAST put it out on DVD so the fans can own the series. It's not as good as continuing it but it's better than nothing.",1342310400,2,1347,4.337301587301587
4605645,5,B0058YPISW,This a great show.  It is interesting.  You are never quit sure what Walter is going to do or why?  Michael Clark Ducan's character is brilliant.  I just can't understand the choices fox makes.,1342224000,5,193,4.588235294117647
4605646,5,B0058YPISW,My wife and I loved this show.  It was the only new show of the season that we liked.  We were very disappointed when it was cancelled.  Can't wait to get the DVD when it is available.,1342137600,3,184,3.918918918918919
4605837,5,B0058YPISW,"The Finder was a bright spot in an otherwise dismal Fox line up, it was unfortunately canceled on a very depressing cliffhanger. If you watch the series, you will form a connection to its quirky episodes and talented actors very quickly - which will cause you to curse Fox broadcasting when you see the last episode at the time of cancellation where the cast are broken and destroyed with no hope in sight. No fun, no fair! Great show but not worth the money to buy the set.",1342137600,2,474,4.3977272727272725
4605838,5,B0058YPISW,"The Finder is one of my all time favorite tv series.
It has so much to it.
The chemistry between the characters on the show is magnetic!!!
You will fall in love with every character on this show.
The ONLY reason it was cancelled is because FOX placed it on the Thursday night line up against shows like Grey's Anatomy.
I'm not even sure it was promoted correctly????
I found it by accident and immediately became a devoted fan from that day on.
You will Love how sexy Geoff Stults is!! HE is a HANDSOME MAN!!
The only thing I would change is I would dress him better... show off that handsome man!!!
You will not regret owning THE FINDER.... it is one investment we all will make.... BUT HOPEFULLY.... a tv network will discover this GEM and pick it up! Please USA, TBS, TNT, A&E.... there are a lot of networks who would do  a great job with this show!!!

4605841,5,B0058YPISW,"My husband and I loved watching The Finder.  It is so different from other shows on TV.  The chemistry between the actors was great and I cared about each one of their story lines.  I would hate to not get to find out what happens to them all.  Come on, Fox, take Walter's catch phrase to heart and just say ""I'm gonna risk it!""",1342051200,2,328,4.078125
4605842,5,B0058YPISW,"Great show!  This is a very good show.  The characters are great and the really work well with each other.  The main character Walter is hilarious and awesome, and his best buddy Leo aka Michael Clarke Duncan works perfect next to the eccentric Walter.

This is not your cookie cutter crime fighting BS CSI show.  The writing is very creative and each is as great as the last.  This is one of my favorite shows and a much watch!",1342051200,2,428,4.3544303797468356

4605999,5,B0058YPISW,"It is just insane that Fox would cancel this show. It is one of the few shows I like.

With enough marketing and advertisement this show could be a huge success.
All I know is that this is a must buy.

4606000,5,B0058YPISW,"I didn't discover the tv show The Finder until about the middle of the season. Each episode brought laughter and suspense and it was something I enjoyed every week. Little did I know that my enjoyment would end when FOX decided to cancel the show after only one season. To the people at FOX - please reconsider your decision! Horrible shows like Glee and Family Guy continue to go on, but wonderful, intelligent shows like The Finder are sent to an early grave. You need to take into consideration that with modern technology not everyone watches a show when it is aired - please have DVRs or watch shows online at their convenience. Just because a show doesn't getting the ratings you think it should the day that it is aired is not reason to cancel it. If you're not going to bring the show back, could you at least put it out on DVD/Blueray for those of us who want to remember what once was?",1341964800,2,895,4.397590361445783

4606002,5,B0058YPISW,"Excellent show, sure to be a classic. We'll be talking about this 20 years from now and I'll have the DVD's. There will probably be a reunion movie and I'll want that too.",1341705600,2,171,4.212121212121212
4606003,5,B0058YPISW,This is one of the best shows on television.  Watched it religiously.  Great combination of comedy and story line.  Truly disappointed that it was cancelled.  Fox really needs to bring it back!,1341705600,,193,4.9375
4606004,5,B0058YPISW,Watching the Finder doesn't just entertain the viewer it connects you with the characters at a deeper level.  You are sympathetic to the plight of the main cast.  This is one not to be missed.,1341705600,,192,4.457142857142857

C'mon Fox, give it a chance!!!!!!  It would make a lot of people very happy if you change your mind!!",1341705600,,402,4.0125

4606129,5,B0058YPISW,"Seriously one of the best shows I have seen! It is witty, well written, funny, emotional, and the actors are amazing. Geoff Stults is incredible as Walter, his ability to find anything, although amazing, isn't what drew me about the character. Walter is kind, in a very odd way. What I love about him is that he has a glorious childlike innocence about him, which oddly enough came about from a very grown up  situation. Everything is black and white with him, something is lost, he finds it, something is broken, he fixes it. People aren't really like that. They are quick to come up with replacements and excuses... Walter never did. It was a glorious change of pace to see someone every week who worked so hard for other people, oftentimes with little regard for himself, and with little to no payment.
Hart Hanson and the crew did a phenomenal job on this show, and it wasn't given a fair run. Starting a show in an off peak slot, then taking the regular mid season hiatus, and changing the air date, all within 13 episodes? No wonder the ratings were lower than Fox wanted... That doesn't mean it wasn't loved by many, we just had to record it, or watch it online somehow.
I am incredibly sad that this show was cancelled, and even though my DVD collection is quite extensive, until The Finder is on my shelf, it will always be lacking.",1341705600,,1341,4.495901639344262

4606134,5,B0058YPISW,"Please bring back Walter!!!!! I loved this show.  Walter is an eccentric but amusing recluse in high demand for his ability to find anything. There were 13 episodes in season 1 before Fox cancelled the show.  Here are the episodes names and descriptions per Wikipedia.

Walter turns to Deputy U.S. Marshal Isabel Zambada (Mercedes Mashn) for insider information about the missing colonel, which links the lost plane to a high-level drug dealer and illegal cargo. But when Walter forms an unlikely connection with the missing father, he not only locates the fallen aircraft, but in the process, he and Leo (Michael Clarke Duncan) uncover the real purpose of the flight and help the teenage boy find closure.

4. ""Swing and a Miss"" - Isabel's new boyfriend Frank (guest star Lance Gross), an all-star baseball athlete, gets robbed, and Walter steps in to help find his stolen collectibles.

5. ""The Great Escape"" - Preston Miller (guest star Jonathan Slavin) is a magician who seeks Walter's help in finding his assistant who vanished after a failed disappearing act attempt.

6. ""Little Green Men"" - The Jeffersonian's Dr. Jack Hodgins ropes Walter into searching for an 'Alien' Spacecraft that was seen and videoed by a pilot of an incoming Space Shuttle who is now dead (due to him not keeping quiet), thereby getting the other pilot, Col. Bradshaw's life back after he was discredited by a shadowy government agency. But all is not as it seems and Walter's life, family and friends face a very real threat from a woman code named 'Pope' (guest star Peta Wilson). Meanwhile Willa and Timo attempt to get their marriage arrangement dissolved by the notorious Uncle Shad. (guest star Eric Roberts)
7. ""Eye of the Storm"" - The episode revolves around Hurricane Catherine, which is currently in Florida. The episode begins with Willa's probation officer coming to quickly inspect her living quarters at the bar; however she ends up having to stay due to the harsh weather.

However, it all gets interrupted by a newsflash on TV about a missing girl. The hurricane forces Walter to find the girl while remaining in his bar.
8. ""Life After Death"" - When a DJ begins playing new songs from a rapper who was gunned down ten years ago, Walter is hired to recover the music for the distributor. Walter instead decides to find the dead rapper despite all evidence of his death. In the course of the investigation, Walter learns more about the dead rapper's final moments, the origin of his songs, and uses this to help heal his still-mourning family.
9. ""The Last Meal"" - Walter is asked to find a meal for a man and his wife's anniversary. However, Walter searches for the chef behind the dish and source of its unique, smokey flavor.

10. ""The Conversation"" - Walter is asked by a young girl to find her recently-disappeared father. Initially uninterested, Walter determines the man had been talking with somebody else just moments after calling his family and sets out to find the conversation itself. Meanwhile Leo is depressed as the birthday of his daughter arrives and he once again contemplates his desire for revenge.
11. ""The Inheritance"" - A friend of Isabel asks for Walter's help to find her father's killer. Walter refuses to seek him out, but eventually agrees to help--not to look for the killer, but to find an inheritance left behind for his daughter.
12. ""Voodoo Undo"" - Shortly after a shoot out, a notorious crime boss seeks Walter's help but finds this job proves to be extra dangerous, primarily the reason he believes he is under a voodoo curse.
13. ""The Boy with the Bucket"" - After discovering that a painting he found was a forgery, Walter begins the search for the original. However, Walter's brother Langston Sherman also shows up to bring him to their dying father, who tasks him with finding the love of his life, but there's one problem: she is in the Witness Protection Program.

Right up there with the X-Files, Quantum Leap, Medium, and 24.

I especially love the characters.  They are so much fun, and have truly interesting relationships.

I hope another channel picks up The Finder, with the entire original cast.

Maybe the last episode can just have been a nightmare that someone had.

4606392,5,B0058YPISW,"Love the Finder, love love love it!

My dearest Fox,

Talk to us Fox!  Tell us that our plight, while still growing, is worth our efforts.  Understand our need to laugh, cringe, smile, and even cry.  Respect our drive to maintain and persistence to regain (or find) what we have lost.  Tell me Fox that you love me, your viewer.  Tell me that I am important to you and am not just the small measure of numbers I contribute to your ratings!  Give me the chance to be your confidant, to whisper in your ear like a burden of conscience or an imaginary angel.  Help me understand the agony of each decision you make and then give me the chance to show you another way or another choice.  Entertainment should not be a chore, it should not drive its makers to distraction nor should it treat its enjoyers like a teenage romance.  The love should not be hard and fast until it has gotten what its came for only to disappear and never be heard from again.  Good entertainment, no, great entertainment is a love for all the ages.  It is a slow budding friendship that draws you in at every turn and makes you stronger with each peak and valley.  It is that new but tightly bonded friendship that seems to find those moments that you will never trade no matter what is offered and sees them for what they could be, knowing them as something more.  Entertainment is at its greatest when that moment a friendship, discovered to be more, is recognized for everything it is, was and can be!  It drives along the line that has been drawn veering so slowly to the side of love that when it finally reaches its destination it has so solidly burrowed into the hearts of its viewers it cannot possibly be rejected.  Fox I would beg and even plead for you to understand that all great love stories as all great TV shows have their ups, their downs, and everything in between!  A person grows with the show, relates to the characters and spends their time invested in the weekly trials that must occur for those characters to grow and develop.  We cradle a developing plot line like we would our own children.  We reach for the remote every week in the hopes of catching up with them like a child that is away at college or working in a bar at the Ends of the Earth.  We cry when they cry, we hurt when they hurt and more importantly, we laugh when they laugh.  We feel their fear as if it is palpable and breathing down our necks!  When they break we break right alongside them but most of the time we are given a priceless gift that we would give anything to have in the here and now with our real live children... some measure of a guarantee that things will, in fact, get better.  Do you know how rare a gift that is my dear friend Fox?  Do you understand how blessed we feel because we know you will not leave our broadcasted children in pain for a moment too long?  Yet even with our reassurances (that at times are only in the farthest of our subconscious corners) we still need to slide to the edge of seats, hold our breath, and pray that our bundles of joy that have been so elegantly displayed on a big box in our living room, will be saved from their hell.  So it shouldn't be a stretch to feel the unimaginable loss we suffer when one our most beloved children is ripped from us, heart and soul, to be left in a state of limbo that we have no chance of rescuing them from.  When our very youngest have no chance to thrive at life even though in such a short period (of 13 episodes) we have already started to see them grow and have found a love for them that is quickly so much deeper than we expected.  I beg you to understand what heartbreak we find and feel when we know that we can no longer look in on our little gypsy girl as she is dangerously hitchhiking her way out of town.  When we cannot find a way back to rescue our very own finder from his federal confines, confines that can no longer be reached by our gun toting good girl.  How sad, no, how broken we will remain with our last image of our giant cuddly legal counsel without his family and alone, again!  We know that we are small in so many ways my dearest Fox we just ask that you can feel our loss.  We ask that you see way to giving back just a little and saving us from a long journey through grief.  You hold the key Fox, you carry it so close to your hearts please just give us one more chance, one more season to show you how we can love, so completely, our gypsy, our lawyer, our federal marshal and our finder.  Please bring our broadcast children home, bring back The Finder!

4606552,5,B0058YPISW,"Without turning this ""review"" into a FOX-bashing bitchfest, let me say that according to its Wikipedia page the show was gaining both an audience and ratings until they took it out of its Thursday timeslot, kept it off the air for a month, and buried it in a Friday night timeslot to die.  Also, airing the episodes out of order with minimal promotion was another mistake.  It was almost like FOX wanted this show to fail...

Anyway, assuming that someone from their DVD division reads this, let me say that a nice, two or three disk collection, featuring the episodes in their original production order and the ""Bones"" backdoor pilot (Season 6, Episode 19) as an extra, would be fantastic.  Bonus points for DVD commentary from the cast on each episode.
