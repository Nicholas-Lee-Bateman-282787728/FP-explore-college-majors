6108191,3,B00GSTHCW6,I love this novuela....but wares the rest of it they need to revise this. Still love this one but the whole novel together better. It only focuses on damien and marinas love story and not the rest of the characters. I will add that jimma naverett and william levy have great chemistry together and love watching them together.,1395792000,,326,4.637931034482759
6108192,3,B00GSTHCW6,"I am disappointed that the DVD does not contain many parts of this story. The parallel relationships are not included as well as some of the plot points. Over all, this is a high quality production, and I am happy to watch it again and again. I just wished it included all the broadcast episodes.",1395705600,,296,4.4

6108194,4,B00GSTHCW6,"Con Muchas Ganas de Ver el DVD.
Ojala contenga un buen Resumen, aunque al parecer solo van a ser 12 Horas de Duracin. No se porque las Telenovelas de Salvador Mejia estan tan mal resumidas... Espero que no pase lo mismo que con Triunfo del Amor y Corazn Salvaje que ambos resumenes son de aproximadamente la misma duracin y estan muy mal editados.
Me gusto mucho esta Telenovela, espero no decepcionarme con el DVD.
Review/Comentario: La verdad es que estoy muy decepcionado con la Edicin del DVD, faltan muchisimas escenas importantes, omitieron la actuacin de Mariana Seoane/Ursula, que si bien no era la villana principal tenia una participacin muy importante al final de la Historia. Quitaron los personajes secundarios y se centraron pura y exclusivamente en los protagonistas.
Me parece horrible lo que hicieron con este Resumen, quitaron todo lo relacionado con la locura de Hernan, su relacion con Ursula, cuando intenta matar al bebe de Marina en el mar y la obliga a casaerse con el, cuando le dispara a Damian, cuando lo internan en el psiquiatrico y Ursula lo ayuda a escapar, no se ve cuando asesina a Ursula ni cuando Mercedes entra a la casa de Hernan para conseguir pruebas en su contra y los hombres de Hernan le disparan en su auto.
Falta el accidente del padre Tomas provocado por Fulgencio, la relacion de Lazaro y Lucia, la relacion de Rebeca y Jose, el Final de Magdalena y tantas otras cosas que quedaron en la nada.
Faltan muchas partes sobre el Final y de los ultimos capitulos.
Eso de resumir las Telenovelas del Sr Salvador Mejia en solo 12 hs de duracion no esta resultando nada bien, me parece un verdadero desperdicio ya que se pierde la escencia de la Historia.
Con haber dejado un poco poquito mas, aunque fueran 2 o 3 hs hubiera quedado mejor la Edicin. Es una pena, realmente.",1395014400,7,1810,4.712933753943218

6108350,4,B00GSTHCW6,"Let me start by saying that the quality of this DVD is great - the audio and visual are excellent. The English subtitles could use some work because they didn't always translate everything accurately but that wasn't a large issue. The DVD also came right on time so that was great.

I'm a recent telenovela fan (due to the gorgeousness of William Levy) and this is the first one I've actually bought on DVD. I've heard so many times about the heavy editing so I think the good thing was that I went into this not expecting too much. I did not watch this telenovela on TV but I am aware of everything that happened due to reading a blog that translates every episode in English. I am pleased that a lot of the extra storylines have been cut out and it MOSTLY focuses on the relationship between Damian and Marina. However, even with that focus, there were so many important scenes that were cut out between the two of them - some of them included subplots involving the couple that I felt were significant. And some of them just included some sweet love scenes that would have been great to see in the middle of the constant drama. I was especially disappointed with that (but don't worry, not ALL of them are gone). I felt like there were other scenes that could have been cut in order to make room for more scenes between the two leads. But even with that, I'm glad that I purchased this because it allowed me to see scenes (with the English subtitles) that I unfortunately cannot locate on Youtube.

Now the quality of the novela itself I cannot judge fully because, of course, a little above 12 hours of footage - plus the little I could find in Spanish & Portuguese on Youtube lol - do not fairly depict the actual hundred or so hours of it. But what I did see, I really liked. All of the actors involved did a good job and of course William Levy was a huge plus for me! ;) I would have given it 3 stars because I was really disappointed about some of the missing scenes but it got 4 because I liked what I did see so much.",1460246400,2,2027,4.276041666666667

6108352,1,B00GSTHCW6,This DVD did not do justice to this telenovela. It cut out all the important scenes of how Max and Maria got together and all the other supporting characters. Very disappointed. Worse editing I have ever seen!,1444521600,,209,4.675675675675675
6108353,1,B00GSTHCW6,"I would not recommend this dvd because the story was cut so much, it wasn't even the story.  I love the story; therefore, this dvd is an insult to actors, production crews, music composers, and every piece of art.  I am waiting for televisa to publish on YouTube.  This is a big INSULT to William Levy and the actors who worked hard for their art.  I was so mad, I through the dvd across the room.  I will not even give this dvd away, because it insults this work.",1442880000,2,464,4.168539325842697

6108491,3,B00GSTHCW6,"La Tempestad (The Tempest - 735 minutes)

William Levy is back but for almost half of the novela he looks like Brad Pitt during his scruffy period, so he is NOT appealing to me: dirty, lanky, shoulder-length hair and of course, the unshaved look.

In this one he plays a professional fisherman named Capitn Damin Fabr, who is under contract to a packing plant that has just hired a new manager, Marina Reverte, played by Ximena Navarrete. The plant is owned by Mercedes Artigas (Daniela Romo) who has a secret in her past.

Our Capitn is a local lady killer who is very open to flirtations and one-night stands.

We have varying degrees of villains, the very worst one is a human trafficker named Ernesto, played by Manuel Ojeda; the next to the worst is Fulgencio, played by Csar vora. The least villainous (because he's crazy) is Hernn, played by Ivn Snchez.

We play Who's your Mama? and have identical twins to complicate matters. Too many tears and begging for forgiveness, with many illogical plot devices. This one is NOT a favorite. I got mine through Amazon.",1397520000,3,1067,4.684491978609626

8626934,1,B00GSTHCW6,The novela focused on their story but theres more than just their story it has other characters and what they're going through ties back up to the main characters so it was missing a big chunk of the story line. Not a good buy,1527552000,,226,4.159090909090909
