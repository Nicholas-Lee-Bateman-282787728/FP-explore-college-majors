8002776,5,B0000TAZ6A,"The movie is probably crap. I don't know, I've never watched it. But I grew up with Heather Locklear, starting with the abomination ""TJ Hooker,"" a cop show starring William. Shatter. As. A. Dedicated. Police. Officer. With. A. Slammin'. Toupee. They squeezed Heather into the tightest police uniform in history and put her in dangerous situations that required going ""undercover"" in lots of bikinis, skintight workout clothes and lingerie.

Puberty (the original ""hair-raising experience"") had set off a carnival ""down there,"" so I definitely noticed Heather Locklear. You might say I rarely got through an episode of TJ Hooker without giving myself a big hand, if you follow my drift. (Some instinct tells me that if you're looking up a piece o' crap like ""return of the Swamp Thing,"" you do.)

Little noticed by critics and cinemaphiles, ""Return of the Swamp Thing"" has only one thing going for it, but it's a doozy: the scene of poor Heather, after being snatched (<- please note that word, it'll come up again) by the bad guys, struggling against the straps of the lab table she's trussed to - wearing only the tiniest see-thru lingerie to protect her delicate, porcelain skin (deaf viewers who can read lips will be especially pleased that Heather provides two sets to work with, if y'knowmsayin' here).

I really must watch this movie sometime. I wore out two VHS videotapes slo-mo'ing back and forth through that scene over and over, so I hold out great hope that the DVD version will last longer, and through careful programming of the ""looping function"" it'll leave both hands free for ... other things.",1448928000,,1612,4.919117647058823
