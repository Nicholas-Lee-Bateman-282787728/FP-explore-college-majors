8745080,4,B006FQ59QS,"The drama revolves around five college friends. The drama at first wasn't all the good but as the story progress and the characters develop, it is worth the watch. I like the characters played by Riko Narumi and Toma Ikuto the most because I think they're the ones that grew the most toward the end of the drama.

I would rate this drama a 4/5 stars for its entertaining college life about friendship, relationships, and adventures, the flow of the story, characters development, and main actors' and actresses' acting skills.",1384646400,,526,4.844444444444444
