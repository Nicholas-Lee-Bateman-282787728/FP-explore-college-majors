Many of the artists were influence by philosphers like Kant, Decartes, Rousseau, Nietzsche,and Martin Luther. There were people questioning the feudal system. A change in the social system with the Middle class rising with the ability to own stores, banks, and go into professions. This open a source of income enabling artists to work for regular members of society and with the artists becoming independent in their work.

The new archtects views toward buildings focused on geometry, lines, and space. The neoclassical ideal was present, but continued but to a lesser degree.

The 4th set of DVDs in this series reveal the modern architectual style in the following:

  1. Royal Saltworks designed by Claude Nicolas to be used for the manuufacting salt, an industral complex that included semi- modern buildings with a large neoclassical section on the front of the main building. The water was was brought from far distances and heated so that the water could evaporate through windows on the sides of the building leaving the salt crystals. There was an area for the workers to live plus they could grow vegtables in specific areas.

  2. La maison de verre designed and built by Pierre Chareau for a doctor. This building squeezed between two other structures with a large area to build a townouse and a doctor's office, by using hidden spaces in the home which is built with with bricks, lumber, metal,there is a large garden in the rear of the house.

  3. Other buildings include The Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao,Spain. Jean Prouve's House which he built on a mountain terrace with any materials left over from his bankrupt business.

  4. The Multimedia Library of Sendai is a translucent glass stucture built for the people, a very unique structure

by Japon par Toyo.

  5. The Abby Church built in 1050, it dates back to the time when huge numbers of people would travel to faraway places on piglrimages. The church layout is on the order of the cross, with increse height and flying buttress for support.

Copans and Neumann are beginning to reach further back in time with Ledoux's saltwokrs and a Romanesque church, and they do an excellent job of not only highlighting the buildings but also the philosophies behind them.  This is another fascinating selection of works from the French documentary series.",1140480000,8,374,5.543859649122807
