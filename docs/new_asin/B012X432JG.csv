7359270,1,B012X432JG,So I received the new Season 2 today as an early Christmas gift from the Mrs. who was tired of my chirping about how ESPN changed this series up. I will confirm that this box set contains all of the previously released Season 2 vol 1 films. It makes having S2 V1 now redundant. S1 V2 has films 16-30 and this new set picks up @ films 31-60. Incredulous marketing maneuver by those responsible. 2 thumbs down for that move. HEY 30 FOR 30....C'mon Man!,1450137600,32,450,4.305882352941176
7359271,3,B012X432JG,"The contents are first-rate. My mediocre score is attributed to the way ESPN has produced this fine series of films. If you bought the first couple of seasons and wanted to continue to purchase future shows, you would have to buy product that contains previously purchased programs. Seems quite unfair to the loyal viewer.",1449964800,18,322,4.981481481481482

7359279,2,B012X432JG,"I really enjoy the 30 for 30 series, I am 2 starring the set ,not the series. A shame companies still use this type of cheap set case. The DVDs are shoved in cardboard. Almost all the discs are scratched ,and have fingerprints (not mine). Brand new right out of the package like this! Over time using this will just continue to add more damage to the discs making them unplayable. Im not even sure there are all fully playable now, haven't watched them all. Come on ESPN! The Blu Ray set of episodes 1-30 was great, I only bought this set because Blu Ray was not available.",1455062400,6,573,4.314814814814815
