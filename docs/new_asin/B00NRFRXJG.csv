8679882,2,B00NRFRXJG,"I bought this DVD because I have only recently discovered Lesley Bovee and I am buying all of her movies. This is the worst I have seen so far. This movie fails both as a general film and especially as a porn film. The sex scenes,especially those of Gloria Leonard,are too tame and too far apart. They are also too dark. At least you get to see Lesley in the nude (too infrequently).The story is about Lesley who marries men for money then quickly ditches them and lives off their wealth. An angel and a devil (two very weak characterisations) bet she wll marry next for love. Eric Edwards is Lesley's love interest. The single sex scene between them is fairly pedestrian and too dark. There are some mildly amusing moments when Gloria and Lesley  are catty towards each other and about other people. Sometimes they speak directly to the camera. Apart from this I found the  movie quite a flat and boring comedy. I only watched it all the way through because of Lesley and Gloria. Take these two beautiful women out of the mix and I think this film really only deserves 1 star.",1435104000,5,1077,4.489795918367347
