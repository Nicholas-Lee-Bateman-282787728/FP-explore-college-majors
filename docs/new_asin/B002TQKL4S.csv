3985939,4,B002TQKL4S,"The DVDs are good but there is a little skipping in some of them and the 8th Season is not included in the Complete Girlfriend Series collection. Also the title that reads on the DVD player for the DVDs says ""Golden Girls"" so I am not sure if the DVDs were recorded over other DVDs. I wish I had known that the complete season was not in the package or I would have contouned looking.",1308009600,13,384,4.133333333333334
3985940,4,B002TQKL4S,"Debuting on the former UPN network in the fall of 2000, Girlfriends chronicled the comedic highs and dramatic lows of four successful black women living in Los Angeles.

Joan Clayton (Tracee Ellis Ross, daughter of the legendary diva Diana Ross) is a sweet, although at times neurotic, lawyer dealing with relationship problems, but is always there for her friends when they need her. Maya Wilkes (Golden Brooks) is Joan's sassy friend and assistant who isn't afraid to speak her mind with some great one-liners.

Toni Childs (Jill Marie Jones) is Joan's childhood friend who grew up in a poor Fresno (the trapdoor to hell, as she calls it) family, but is now a wealthy and snobby real estate agent. Lynn Searcy (Persia White), Joan and Toni's former college roommate, is a free spirit always looking for a couch to crash on. She's got several degrees, but the girl's allergic to getting a job. William Dent (Reggie Hayes), the only male friend aka ""honorary girlfriend"", also works at Joan's firm and keeps everybody laughing with his dry wit and love for girl on girl action. Don't ask.

Would you believe Kelsey Grammar was the executive producer of the show? My mouth dropped open in surprise when I learned that. Go 'head, Frasier! The things I enjoyed the most about the show were the interactions between the friends. Each of them had their flaws (Toni's self-absorption and materialism in particular), but they still possessed likeable qualities.

Joan always overanalyzed things in her friend and romantic relationships (not to mention she could be a total spaz at times), but it's clear that she has a good heart and only wants the best for everybody. Maya could've easily fallen into (and nearly does in the first few seasons) the ""slang droppin', finger snappin', ghetto mama with her neck in constant rotation"" stereotype, but Golden's take on the character keeps her in check. And then there's Lynn. Although the woman's lazy and a total freak (her sexual adventures are a running joke throughout the series), ya just gotta love her. She's so kooky and funny.

Like many other sitcoms, Girlfriends had plenty of laughs with some drama thrown in. Issues like AIDS, physical and emotional infidelity, racism, homophobia, and the aftermath of a miscarriage were given a spotlight in a non-preachy way. Until the last few seasons anyway.

The show started to go downhill after Jill Marie Jones left the show at the end of the 6th season. Monica Brooks (Keesha Sharp), the hilariously snarky foe of the girls and William's love interest, was chosen to fill her spot and she suddenly became friendly with the others, but it didn't work very well. Also the show lost some of it's comedy and the dramatic elements were more forced than natural. It's a shame that the series was ended after eight seasons without a proper finale. Thanks alot, CW!

Despite that, Girlfriends was quite an interesting show that wasn't completely set on obnoxious sterotypes or bad writing. It was fresh and entertaining. Plus there were some great guest appearances from Angie Stone (who performs the theme song with that silky, soulful voice of hers), Jill Scott, CCH Pounder, and Kimberly Elise, among others.

Dvd extras include detailed episode guides, a look into how the show was created, and many well done featurettes behind some of the biggest episodes (Toni's wedding being one of them). So kick back and enjoy. Sung like Angie Stone ""my girrrrlfriends!""",1288483200,50,3450,4.946459412780657

3985974,5,B002TQKL4S,"Just seeing the Complete Series after ordering Seasons 1through 7 individually!....boy oh boy, the money I could have saved! At any rate, I thought that I would not order another season after the season that included Toni ( I  Toni) but after watching seasons 1 thru 6 over and over and realizing how hilarious and talented  Mya is also....I thought I would go ahead and purchase season 7 andddd I wasn't disappointed at all! Still miss Toni though and don't like that Joan felt that they all should have turned on Toni bc she and Toni fell out.....they were ALL friends ( including William). Toni shud have been at the wedding, even if only  to give her fans one last time with her.  Maybe they could not work that out and make that appearance happen but it wud have been very nice to see. The comment made ( on series 7) that Toni was not invited due to she and Joan's fall out was really disappointing.  Again, they were ALL very close friends and it shud not have been entertained or expected that Toni wud not be invited....really disappointed that such a comment was put in the show.  Finally, am I the only one who wanted Joan and Davis to become a couple???? Out of all of her love interests, my ABSOLUTE fav is Davis! Never understood why they never gave the fans more of Davis and Joan rather than waisting time with William and Joan. I couldn't wait until that was over..omgoodness!  Love William but he and Joan....that was jus wrongggggg. Well, guess I'm on to purchasing the final season at now totaling well over $100 when I could have simply paid $40 Nevertheless, I've enjoyed each individual season that I've purchased  and sooooo hoping for a 10th year reunion that would include TONI!!   Thanks Girlfriends! I enjoy so very much! ",1518480000,,1750,4.576923076923077

3985976,5,B002TQKL4S,"This was my favorite show and I'm still salty about how they ended it all.  It was completely disrespectful to the fans.  Still so many unanswered questions.  The network never respected this show.  Anyway, if you loved this show, you have to have this in your collection.  The show has aged well and on many levels, it was ahead of it's time.  One gripe about this set is that the final season is out of order.....discs 2 and 3 are reversed.  There are a lot of reboots going on right now and this show should be at the top of the list.  Either a reboot or a movie and I'm good.",1518220800,3,579,4.153153153153153
3985977,4,B002TQKL4S,"My only gripe about this set was that I was hoping that they'd be able to get the music licensing cleared. Particularly in episode ""Where Everyone Knows My Name"" in season 3. The end of the original episode had the Donny Hathaway song, ""Giving Up"", where Mya walks out of the club after dancing with Darnell...Some unknown original song was playing.  But most disappointing would be the soul train line scene at the end of ""The Wedding"" episode. Originally Shalamar's ""A Night To Remember"" played. They substituted it with some lame disco track. That took away from the feeling... Other than that, great addition to my collection.",1517961600,4,630,4.88785046728972

The individual discs have the season and disc number as well as a list of the episodes. I love the episode listings makes it easier when you know exactly what you want to watch. However, I personally don't like the way the discs are inside the case. I feel the disc should have been more secure and connected to the cover. Overall Im excited about receiving this series.

3986032,5,B002TQKL4S,"In a rare growth in Prime Time comedidramas featuring persons of color, ""Girlfriends"" was a durable success story that quietly grew along for over 8 years. In urban (black) households, ""Girlfriends"" was often the most popular show of the week. However, UB nor CW networks seemed too dedicated to getting it out of its limited perception. Often compared to as a ""Sex in the City"" for people of color, ""Girlfriends"" was far more than an imitation of another series. Capturing professional women of color, starred or co-starred Tracee Ellis Ross, as a successful attorney in Los Angeles with equally successful girlfriends who coped with everyday challenges being women of color in a white, male dominated culture. Typical scenarios like dating were counterbalanced with the modern day challenges of having a sexual life in a big American city, including things like STDs, premature pregnancy, etc.
Tracee had quickly built an impressive resume hosting Lifetime's ""The Dish"" to MTV's ""Lyricist Lounge"". These weren't ratings busting series....but, did offer Ross a center stage profile on series that were often monitored by Hollywood agents and talent agencies. She had roles in a couple of indie movies, but, it was most likely the exposure on both MTV and Lifetime, along with a rather famous entertainment last name.
All of the ladies on this series were gorgeous though insecurity ruled the ruse as they tried to make sense of why they were often left perplexed as to why they had much to worry about.
""Girlfriends"" was blatantly ignored by the Hollywood elite industry, therefore, they had no presence on the Emmys for instance. However, the series was often nominated (and won) the Image Award for itself and its leading lady, Miss Tracee Ellis Ross!",1409529600,6,1754,5.09375

3986039,4,B002TQKL4S,"I loved the DVD set of Girlfriends. The television series was truly comparable to my life in my thirties. Mara Brock Akil truly knows that African-American woman in her thirties strive to be successful, ambitious, vulnerable, intelligent and willing to go there with others. But at the same time capturing that African-American women want to have it all just like their Caucasian/Sex in the City sisters.",1404777600,4,404,5.136363636363637
3986040,3,B002TQKL4S,I viewed the first disc on my portable dvd player and it froze for a split second in different scenes.  Last night I played in on my computer it did the same thing.  Tonight I'll be testing it on my home dvd player to see if it does the same thing.  Overall I love the Series.  I purchased it because I wanted to see it from start to finish.  I wasn't a fan when it aired on prime time in the prior years.  After seeing the reruns I began to enjoy the show.,1396569600,5,457,3.860215053763441

3986045,5,B002TQKL4S,"I bought this for my wife who loves the series and was upset when it went of the air after eight seasons.

It's like the black version of  Sex and The City.",1388275200,3,324,3.984375

3986053,5,B002TQKL4S,"I actually want to rate this 4.5 stars due to errors on two of my discs.  I believe that to be a manufacturer's defect.  On to the review:

What's funny is that this show was supposed to be the all-Black answer to ""Sex and the City"".  It quickly became a force to be reckoned with all on its own.  The four lead actresses Tracee Ellis Ross (Joan), Golden Brooks (Maya), Persia White (Lynn), and Jill Marie Jones (Toni) are great all throughout.  They're sexy, stylish, intelligent, ambitious, educated...and flawed.  And it's the flaws in each of their characters, portrayed so wonderfully through smart and witty writing, that sets this show apart from its ""competition"".  Issues that are unique to the African-American experience give this show a layer that blends well with the comedy and inevitable drama.

Another tidbit: unlike the girls from SATC, we see where these women have gotten their education and are able to afford their lifestyles, extravagant and otherwise.  We see them go through economical highs and lows, and career changes--very realistic.  SATC, on the other hand, not so much.  How DOES Carrie Bradshaw manage to have several pairs of Manolo Blahnik shoes?  Own an apartment on, I believe, the East side of Manhattan?  All by writing a weekly newspaper column?  Gimme a break!  Is that part of the reason she was so attached to John Preston, going as far to refer to him as ""Mr. Big""?  I'm just saying...

Unfortunately, this show ""jumped the shark"" after the 6th season, when Jill Marie Jones departed from the series.  Like any ensemble, the show lost a bit of its heart when she left.  The character of Toni and her entire story arc was crucial to the show, and Jones was beautiful and charismatic.  As the viewer, I felt her absence and missed her on screen.  Season 7 was passable, and should have ended at that point.  Season 8 was kind of hollow--even more so as the season was shortened due to the 2008 Writer's Strike, and subsequently cancelled.

All in all, I do not regret this purchase.  It will forever be one of my favorite series, and I'm glad that I can watch it at a drop of a hat.  On another personal note, this show was a lifesaver during Hurricane Sandy.  We were blessed to not have any damages and no power outages, save for our cable.  For an entire month, ""Girlfriends"" and my books were my sole sources of entertainment.  Made for some pretty good memories with my mom.",1367366400,10,2421,4.657210401891253
