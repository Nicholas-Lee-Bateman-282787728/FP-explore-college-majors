I walked out at the end of the fight between humans and  Psychlo because it became too rediculous.  This is a movie I do not want to  watch ever again.",958348800,9,311,3.967741935483871

1274675,5,B00003CXIU,"Even while being aware that this probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen in a linear fashion, I have to say that I really enjoyed ""Battlefield Earth"".  And I'm not a Scientologist and have never read anything by L. Ron Hubbard.

The movie has no respect for anything but the ideology that fuels it, as a can of LSD would fuel Alfred Neuman in the pages of MAD.

John Travolta and Forest Whitaker look like two sallow, apple cheeked creatures who meet with a puppetlike entity in the dark, some judge of whether they will or will not leave the ship? when they want to.  The impression one gets is that the two are soldiers.  Cut from this scene to Travolta dangling rats and rotten fruit in the face of the humans--who look a bit like a group who escaped from a filmed parody of the band Tool--and treat them very badly indeed.  Till one, the Spartacus of the Todd Maynards, rises up.

The reason this probably seems just so strange (and bad) is that the actors were caught up in their Scientologist beliefs while filming.  Tom Cruise probably showed up on the set dressed as an animal or what have you; it is just a snapshot of a very weird frame of mind.  Everyone hates it; I'd buy it.",1508544000,,1195,4.346846846846847

1274679,2,B00003CXIU,"The ""bad guy"" costumes were plausible for space aliens nowadays as most anything goes. However the man creatures' attire was totally inappropriate for the situation and bordering on the reticules.

People have run the mental range from morons to illiterate to excelling down through the ages. But to think that you take someone who has trouble rubbing two sticks (one stick too many) together and teach him Euclid in 5 minutes is really stretching anyone's credibility. Putting ""goat guy"" in a flight simulator must make Air Force pilots feel special. Interesting that all this weaponry in the hands of professionals only take nine minutes to get defeated; but if you are ditzy you can give the bad guys a run for their money (gold) with a handful of the very same (mysteriously operable) weapons.

You would have gotten more action waving the flag (everyone knows what a flag is) then deciding a casual glance at the declaration of independence is going to inspire nomadic people that already have their society organized and relative freedom. For that matter are you going to inspire people with a mushy speech about a paper that has no relevance to them?

It did have the ""Let's go get-um"" feel and action of the movie ""Independents Day""",1503964800,,1240,4.867298578199052

It's right up there with Spaceballs and Red Dwarf, maybe better. As a guilty pleasure, right up there with Hudson Hawk. This movie had meta written all over it from beginning to end. The filmmakers and everyone involved with making this movie had to have had a blast making it, tongues firmly planted in cheeks. How Johnny T and Forrest W got thru takes keeping a straight face delivering the comedy gold that was the BE script will be the stuff of movie making legend.. These two great actors were on point channeling there inner Laurel & Hardy's. Ultimately all the critics got it completely wrong panning this movie.

1274884,5,B00003CXIU,"SciFi Magazine had an article this month discussing the recent rerelease ... with added content ... of L. Ron Hubbards iconic work of fictional SyFy. This got me nostalgically thinking back to the spring of 2000 when this wonderful film arrived to theaters. The other night I decided to watch my copy again and Im always left bewildered how (re)viewers can shower this classic adaptation with such ridicule.

Did this movie not garner seven nominations at the 2001 Golden Raspberry Awards?

* Worst Movie of the Year
* Worst Actor - (Travolta)
* Worst Supporting Actor - (Pepper)
* Worst Supporting Actress - (Preston)
* Worst Director
* Worst Screenplay
* Worst Screen Couple - (Travolta and anyone sharing the screen with him.)

Did it not sweep these awards against such formidable competition as The Next Best Thing, The Flint Stones in Viva Rock Vegas, Little Nicky & Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2? And did this not tie it with Paul Verhoevens 1995 classic Showgirls for the most Razzies ever awarded to one single movie? A record it would later eclipse by being presented with yet an 8th award acknowledging it as the ""Worst Drama of our First 25 Years"".

The recognition does not stop there. Once again it was lauded in 2010 with an incredible 9th Razzie for being the Worst Picture of the Decade"". This recognition of cinematic greatness lasted until 2012 when it was dethroned by the 10 awards given to that Adam Sandler comedic juggernaut Jack & Jill.

No doubt there will be vociferous disagreement with my support of this film. It matters not; I made it through all 118 minutes so I am entitled to my opinion. Laugh as we may, the whole experience gave me pause to reflect upon one last great universal achievement, the absence of a final distinction being inexplicably held backhow could MST3K pass on Battlefield Earth?

The writing is bad, the acting is amongst the worst from many of these well established actors, the graphics are on par with something off the SyFy Channel, and the reach was far beyond the film makers grasp. It's interesting,  funny and entertaining for all the wrong reasons.  It's a bomb, a failure, an astounding debacle and yet that's the charm of it. Like a high school play.

1275019,2,B00003CXIU,"Join John Travolta and Forest Whitaker in the worst roles in their careers.  Travolta plays Term and Whitaker as Ker, Psychlos who have dominated Earth and enslaved humans.  This is much like Planet of the Apes in the respect that humans in this movie are the inferior species.  Travola's character believes humans can be used to further his own plans and line his pockets with gold.  He uses them to mine.  Whitaker's character, Ker, is Term's assistant.  Term makes sure that anything that goes awry can be blamed on Ker.  (Typical senior management, right?!)

This movie wasn't intended to be a comedy.  And truly, it really isn't.  It's funny, but not ha-ha funny.  It's funny in the same pathetic way some people might laugh at a person who stumbles and falls.  It wasn't supposed to have happened but now that it has and you've seen it, you can hardly stop yourself from snickering once or twice.

L. Ron Hubbard, author of the book, probably vomited in his mouth once or twice when seeing the rushes for this pathetic film.  However, Travolta seems to embrace his character and occasionally it isn't a total disaster.",1429401600,3,1124,4.756476683937824

1275022,5,B00003CXIU,"I bought this movie out of curiosity and I knew there might be a good chance I was out four bucks. This was another case of don't listen to the critics and don't listen to other people. You have to watch the movie for yourself. Travolta who is actually a great actor who has just been in a lot of bad to mediocre films gave a great performance here. I thought this was a great role for him as the villain. He made for an interesting villain and showed some real charisma in the film. He was very campy.

  Whitaker the other great actor in here plays Travolta's lackey and seemingly not too intelligent character. Whitaker is an Oscar winner and I always thought he was a great actor. Here he definitely puts some good acting into the film though his performance is not as strong as Travolta's and I think that was due to the way his part was written. Whitaker couldn't give a bad performance if he tried and I think sadly he'll go down as one of the most unrecognized talents even though he won the Oscar.

  Barry Pepper was never my favorite actor but he does a good job playing the hero and is a likable character. He doesn't come across stupid but he's more of an every day guy who people can relate to. The actress I forget her name who is the lead I read won worst actress for The Rashpeys or whatever that show is. She wasn't in it that much and I thought she did fine. She didn't give any serious dramatic blow your mind away performance but it was credible and I think her performance is underrated.

  I don't think this movie was meant to be a comedy but it comes off as one mixed with good action. I found it to be a very interesting movie. There were some parts I could take it as a serious film. I think the last third of the film with the action alone made it a good film. I did laugh during a lot of the movie and it was a very entertaining film. I really liked Travolta in this role. It was kind of campy and if you go into this movie not expecting an Oscar worthy film you may like it.

  Battlefield Earth is a very different kind of film. To me I liked it. It's a guilty pleasure film. For me I thought this was going to be like Jaws 4 The Revenge but I thought it was a good entertaining movie. I was shocked I liked it and shocked that I liked Travolta's performance so much in it. I am glad I liked it and as insane as it sounds to most people in the world I will be watching this movie several times again in the future. I recommend this movie to everyone and Travolta fans especially. But I recommend you either rent it or buy it at a very low price so if you don't like it you are only out a couple bucks or could trade the dvd in to a dvd store.

The costumes look ridiculous, the camera is constantly tilted, the premise is idiotic, the villains claim to be so advanced yet they keep doing things that are utterly stupid, and we seem to always be looking through either a blue or yellow lens filter.  Oh, and why is every dissolve in this movie a curtain wipe?  Was that the only thing the editor could think of to do in order to transition to another scene?

So these aliens claim that they are able to defeat all of Earth's militaries in 9 minutes, yet they are then defeated by a bunch of cavemen in fighter jets that have maybe 10 hours of flight time total on the things?  Plus these jets and weapons and computers have been sitting around for literally 1,000 years and they still work just fine?  Yeah right!

Moving on, these guys claim to be so smart but they can't figure out what humans like to eat?  They have a machine that lets them talk to humans and they don't think to just ask us what our favorite foods are?  Let's not forget that they can teach us to speak their language but they can't speak ours?  They didn't think to learn how to read our languages and find out from the internet, or books, or even 3rd grade text books, that humans had stockpiles of gold all over the planet that was already mined and stored by our governments?

I could go on and on for hours why this movie is stupid and makes no sense on dozens of different levels, but just take my word for it, it's utterly stupid!  Why did John Travolta agree to do this?  Did he really just need a paycheck?  Was he blackmailed?  Did he owe somebody a favor?  What was he thinking!?!

I rented this film to see how bad it was and it was awful. The Psychloes (especially Terl, the head Psychlo) are dumb villains and their outfits look ridiculous. The film's unnecessary use of Dutch angles were bad, plot holes (eg. Terl being punished for a longer time for doing something against Psychlo policy),  John Travolta's performance as Terl was horrible. Barry Pepper did a better job in ""Saving Private Ryan."" I might watch ""The Green Mile"" sometime. Anyway, I have seen better sci-fi films than this. The quotes that I found extremely dumb were ""When the gods lived here they could fly through the air. They'd drive chariots in front of special caves with golden arches. Golden! And the food would magically appear."", ""While you were still learning to spell your name, I was being trained to conquer galaxies."", and when Johnnie (Barry Pepper's character) dances around in his cave and says, ""Has anyone here ever seen one? A demon? A monster? A beast?"" To end this review, I just want to say that it was good that ""Battlefield Earth"" failed at the box office. However, I own this on DVD to watch to pretend to be a movie critic. But, that doesn't mean I enjoy the film.

The rest is about a fair-haired human who leads the ultimately successful fight against the invaders. All humans except this fellow seem to be reduced to a state of bestiality, until our hero is improbably taught the aliens' technology and language, which leads the humans to the improbable-squared discovery a cache of fighter jets that (1) still work, and (2) they learn to fly in less than a week.

1275301,1,B00003CXIU,"First and foremost, this movie costed 73 Million dollars to make, now lets dive in.

Okay, now to give you some perspective on how bad this movie is, I barely made it through the first 10 minutes,
that's right, I had to jump through this movie in the hopes that it'd be at least mediocre, but no, it's not.

We are supposed to believe that Humanity was defeated, in 9 MINUTES, how the heck did that go down?
What kind of weapons as used to accomplish this feat? Where is this weapon in the film?

Oh yeah, and after the alien race, whose name I refuse to say because Is till have my dignity, enslaved us,
I'd have thought hey would have built new structures, but what do they do instead, they take up residence in the ruins
of building start where destroyed during their nine minute assault, WHY?

The movie itself is FULL of conveniences, for example;
-The aliens have a machine that can give infinite knowledge to its user
-The Protagonists find books, weapons, food and technology that can still be used 1000 years in the future

And there's plenty more where those came from.

The actor's aren't believable, the CGI is terrible, and the cinematography is the worst part.

There some scenes where everything has this nasty colored tint, for no reason at all. There's a scene where someone is
running, and suddenly everything turns green! Every shot int his movie is at an angle (i.e. TILTED), once again, no purpose.

Spoiler Alert (DO YOU EVEN CARE AT THIS POINT?)

The biggest loophole in the whole movie: The Climax

In the climax of this movie, 6 Fighter jets and a hand full of Cavemen take down the ENTIRE alien race in 10 minutes.

The end of this film is devoid of logic (much like the rest for the picture), and I'm gonna call that the last straw.

There is nothing redeemable about this epic fail, and for the bottom line, i've gotta say Terrible, the lowest of the low,
0%- Arguably the biggest Cinematic Tragedy second to Batman and Robin, Battlefield Earth is mediocre, expensive, ugly

If Warner Brothers had marketed this as 2 hours of bloopers and outtakes, it might have fared better. That it was marketed as anything more than pure camp is regrettable.

The reviewers who are rating this as 5 stars because ""it is so bad, it's good"" are trying to put a positive spin on a truly poor movie. My first impulse was that Andy Kaufman must be pulling my leg. The gratuitous nostril flaring is on a par with ""More cowbell!!"", but not funny.

John Travolta hasn't been hanging around Hollywood for close to a Millennium without any talent (there are some who do, but Travolta isn't one of them), and Forrest Whitaker is so good that almost any project he's in is worth watching just for his performance.

Note I said ""almost"" because that qualifier certainly doesn't apply to ""Battlefield Earth.""

This movie is bad, cataclysmically, unapologetically, unabashedly terrible.  To this day I have nightmares of Travolta's leering face as he looks up and barks, ""I'm not your friend"" in a desperate high-pitched squeal as if he has absolutely no idea of how to deliver the line.  Well Mr. Travolta, you must have had some idea because the result you choose was pretty much the exact opposite of what you should have done (such disconnects do not happen by accident).

The only way I can recommend this movie is if you're thinking of getting into Scientology.  Before you join any religion, you should probably read some of the other works by the founding member.

1275437,5,B00003CXIU,"I have loved this movie since it was released and I am also a fan of Bladerunner, also panned by critics and public, and have seen both movies multiple times and they continue to reward each viewing. The crux is this; a primitive jumps from barbarian slave to aristocratic warrior because of directly implanted education. My most fervent dream for our modern downtrodden. Untaught people in a time of extreme danger are able to learn quickly and intuitively how to handle complex machinery; Like Lincoln Six Echo and Jordan in The Island, they encounter situations many times where their lives are on the line and learn rapidly what they need to know to survive and prevail. ""It's just like breaking a horse,"" said about learning how to fly the Harrier. How many modern fighter pilots could break a horse? The extreme self sacrifice of blowing yourself up with a nuclear device for the welfare of your tribe; what could be more ennobling. The killer is the scene where Johnny starts speaking Psychlo, it is bloody electrifying. I speak a lot of languages outside of my mother tongue of English and I know well the thrill of going from gibberish to clear communication. I love this scene. I said to my wife; ""It bothers me that as a novelist, my job is to create entertainment product and this is one of my most loved films and the viewing public hates it."" Sabine Karsenti is a breath of heaven every time she gets on camera, Forest Whitaker is outstanding and John Travolta pulls off a difficult role with aplomb. Barry Pepper is outstanding as the primitive turned resistance fighter. If these aspects were lacking then I could understand the film's detractors but millions spent on special effects do not an inspiring film make.  I am not a fan of LRH philosophy but this film is about the human struggle to overcome slavery and ignorance and succeeds very well. I read the book when it was published and could not handle the Decology but the first book is a thrill both times I have read it. Different from the movie but complementary. With this movie it is important not to throw the baby out with the bathwater.

Thus we see what the mind of a paranoid schizophrenic with massive delusions of grandeur actually believes or pretends to believe. He actually believed all this $hyte. Literally.

L. Ron Hubbard was an evil man. He wrote an execrable book (basis of this, ""the worst film of the century"", as many respected reviewers say) and fostered an execrable cult. He ranks with Hitler as one of the evil men of the 20th Century. He literally wrote the book on ""Suppressive Personalities"" and was doubtless one of the top ""SP's"" of all time. Indeed, I just saw a video of James Randi who knew LRH shortly after ""Dianetics"" came out, as one amongst a group of fellow sci-fi writers in the pulp fiction days. He said Hubbard was not liked by ANY in the writer's group and Randi considered him not just ""an evil man"" but ""a willfully evil man, he knew what he was doing"" and ""he was in it just for the money"".

His vile offshoot, Scientology, employs all the most proven techniques of powerful cults to do evil to all who criticize it. That such a vile film should be universally panned by everyone with any sense, indeed by almost all who know anything about it, is a breath of fresh air into an otherwise foetid and virulent cesspool that needs to be revealed and reviled for its totalitarian and oppressive leadership - to wit, David Miscavige.

The completely illogical plot is based on a novel by L Ron Hubbard, the founder of Scientology. I never read the novel, but the movie version contains no overt or covert references to Hubbard's controversial philosophy. I found this somewhat surprising, since Travolta (a Scientologist of long standing) bankrolled the entire project. But perhaps it was just as good, since ""Battlefield Earth"" quickly got the reputation for being *the* worst movie ever made. I suppose Scientology has enough bad media exposure already, LOL.

But is ""Battlefield Earth"" really the absolutely worst film ever? I beg to disagree with that assessment. Sure, it's definitely not a *good* movie. Bad acting, bizarre costumes and a lousy dialogue are some of the ingredients. However, if you take it with a large grain of salt and consider it a comedy, it's perfectly possible to survive. You might even find it entertaining. Personally, my interest started to wane after about 90 minutes (the run time is almost two hours), but I suppose a beer or a very strong coffee might take care of that little problem...

Since ""Battlefield"" wasn't exactly a box-office success, Travolta couldn't make a sequel, so those of us who don't wish to read the original novel are left in the dark about the ultimate fate of the main protagonists. However, I think the battle had a suitable ending, so I'm not entirely dissatisfied. I mean, the good guys really did win! Given Hubbard's slightly paranoid worldview, I expected much worse...

In the end, I give ""Battlefield Earth"" two stars, but perhaps three-and-a-half for the involuntary entertainment value. Trust me, this will become a classic!",1366588800,,2055,5.035294117647059
1275499,1,B00003CXIU,"As a kid I read the book and, for a young adult, the book was good.  Oh, you know the science was not the best, the aliens, called Psychlos, had that weird, and very rare, problem in science fiction stories in which the alien race was both too alien yet not alien enough, and the human Hero was named Jonnie Goodboy Tyler which just seems wrong, but the author was L. Ron Hubbard who, if given enough pages, could explain everything to the point where it seemed realistic or was buried under so much cow patties that you gave in and moved on.  And this novel was 1050 pages long.  At least the aliens had to wear suits.
Now, before I get into the film I will let you know that I understand there was meant to be two movies - and this first movie only covers the events in the first part of the book.  Also, I understand they had problems, before, during, and after production of the movie.  So I will not judge the film based on the book and I will give it some leeway for all the problems it had in its birth.
I also went into this KNOWING I was going to watching one of the worse films ever made.  I ordered pizza to have while watching it, with wings and dessert.  The works.  So, now the result.
To say this film has lots of plot holes would be a grave understatement.  The movie is ONE huge hole.  Not just plot holes.  Character plots. Logic plots.  Camera angle holes.
First, all the camera shots are angled and tilted.  So, please remember, that everything I talk about is also at an angle.
We open up with the humans rushing into their compound at night and closing their wooden...garage door?  The main character's girlfriend is worried that if they close the gate he can't get in.  But its ok, because after they close the door he rides up with his horse and enters the compound.  He didn't need to get through the wooden barrier.  Than what was the point of having it?  And when, later in the movie, the girlfriend wants to leave to find him she has to open the gate to escape.  WHY?  The wall does not go all the way around the compound.  That makes no sense!  Than we have the aliens.  The aliens come across as way too stupid to be able to do anything.  Now, the book did a good job at explaining this but the movie does not have the time to do so and did not even try.  The humans, in the film, figure out how to repair and fly military jets within weeks.  1000 year old military jets.  There are books still in one piece after being neglected for a 1000 years.  And the aliens never searched for gold mankind had already dug up and refined?  Really?
Sure, I liked some of the scenes.  The humans being kept in a zoo being feed what looks like greenish oatmeal.  The fact that the humans sometimes made primate sounds, like....primates, was amusing and, I felt, a good idea.  The setting of the dark, gritty future touched something inside me, that part of me that finds 1984 and dark futures so interesting.
But if the humans are so worthless to the aliens, why bother to have them?  Surely there is equipment, machinery, robots who could do the same work, faster?  And if the Earth's gravity was so light when compared to the alien's own planet why were they so slow?  Scared to fall over?  Did they never get use to walking about?  Why did their equipment look so backwards?  Is standard alien equipment made to be used by fools?  And when the aliens are having pieces of their body SHOT off they don't seem to bleed or feel pain?  What the heck - how did that evolve in their species?  Why did they take over human buildings to live and work in if they were so uncomfortable and the humans were so stupid?  They have been there so LONG why haven't they made more comfortable quarters for themselves?  I could go on, and on, and on.
Even I was not prepared for the level of badness, even with the pizza, all the warnings from the reviews, and being a fan of MST3K.  Still, some parts made me laugh and I did enjoy John Travolta's alien Hamlet.
So, if you plan to watch this movie, watch it with the knowledge that is it a BAD movie.  Not just a B-movie bad.  No.  There are a few extras and a commentary track, and behind-the-scenes documentary.  But if based just on the movie I would say - unless you want to say you saw the worst-movie-ever-made - skip it.

But Battlefield Earth is the most profoundly bad motion picture I've ever seen in my entire life. So bad that even my prodigious capacity for the appreciation of awful science fiction isn't great enough to allow me to enjoy it from a campy, unintetional comedy standpoint. It's just excruciatingly painful - like an H-bomb in a volcano.

The fact that this abomination didn't immediately and irretreivably end the careers of everyone associated with it from John Travolta and Forrest Whittaker to the key grip and caterer is both perplexing and disappointing to me.",1354060800,7,849,4.775510204081633
1275570,2,B00003CXIU,"The story is terrible. As many have pointed out, the plot holes are many and huge. But, the acting is not so bad.  And the alien, Terl, played by John Travolta is actually an interesting character and a villain you could love to hate.  But the character falls flat in the latter part of the movie. The alien Psychlos are much more interesting than the heroic human characters.  When the story revolves around the duplicitous Psychlos, the movie is actually fun. One does need an enormous suspension of disbelief to accept this movie as serious science fiction. So forget that. But as a send up, probably unintentional, it stands alongside ""Independence Day."" I enjoyed the movie. It is fun in spots, terrible in others and borders on boring in the last quarter. But I don't regret watching it. It is certainly not the worst movie ever made.

1275571,1,B00003CXIU,"i think most people who watched this movie over exaggerated how bad it is. i mean, it is bad, but not the worst movie of all time. i'd say it's no worse than a syfy channel original movie. the villains of the movie seem like they're made for a childrens sci fi movie. the movie is set in the year 3000, which is 1000 years after humans were defeated by an alien race whose technology seems less advanced than ours.",1347148800,4,414,4.1875
1275572,1,B00003CXIU,"So its the year 3000 and the human race or whats left of it has been enslaved by a huge race called the Psychlo, who seem content to watch men and women get materials from Earth that will prove profitable to the Psychlo nation. There's a leader called Terl (John Travolta, ""Grease"") who sees the Earth as his way to get rich and grow more powerful and all that's standing in his way is a guy named Tyler (Barry Pepper, ""The Green Mile"") who feels he can get all remaining humans to break free from their slavery jobs and fight these aliens and take back the Earth.

I don't think words can truly describe how insanely and monstrously awful this movie is on every level and I mean every level, I have no clue who thought this was a good idea and who really thought it was a good investment since while it is goofy, cheesy and badly done special effects wise this flick still got a $44 million budget which had to go somewhere. Its beyond unintentionally funny during every scene, every bit of dialogue especially during the scenes with Travolta and Forest Whitaker (""The King of Scotland"").

It also hurts really, really bad since the actors all play this straight and this could easily be the ""Plan 9"" of modern film making as Ed Wood could only have hoped to make such a pile of you know what as at least with his films you could tell he was trying to be good. ""Battlefield Earth"" is not a movie where any trying was happening, well unless it was trying to suck but it didn't have to try hard.

This is on a whole new level of bad, easily up there with ""Wing Commander"" on the short worst films ever made list. This needs to be made fun of and ripped apart with some friends, cause there's no way beyond comedy that this would have any redeeming qualities. 1/2 out of 4 stars.",1343952000,6,1777,4.31437125748503
1275573,5,B00003CXIU,"This review is from both the Widescreen DVD & Netflix HD version of this severely underrated film from 2000.

OK, let's face it, many (OK almost everyone) who saw this just went ahead with the crowd and dissed it as terrible movie. But i think the film was just misunderstood.
It's easy to forget this was Roger Christian's first attempt at directing a serious die hard Sci-Fi film. A whole lot of extremely talented people worked hard on this. Based on L. Ron Hubbard's masterpiece, which trying to interpret that epic story into a single 2 hour movie would be a challenge for any great director! Good thing this director had a rich history of Art Direction, Special Effects (he worked on Star Wars: A New Hope in '77) & high resolution miniature/motion control photography. So the film benefits from all that passion, integrity & skill. Netflix has this movie in full 1080P, not to mention a few key shots that were left out of the theatrical version.

SPECIAL EFFECTS: The alien transport ships, Denver Human processing center in domed glass over a 50 mile radius, and the Psychlo's home planet were all produced with extraordinary care & detail, George Lucas himself had to marvel about the production value & superb special effects featured in BFE: Saga of the year 3000.

The thing is, you have to watch this movie a few times to work out all the ""whys"" and ""whats"", and just concentrate on having a ball experiencing it's flow and well blended foolishness! ;D

The DVD version has a few cool extras, including ""in movie"" making of, & separate shot sequences for each ""special effect"" worthy of extra attention, which can obviously be turned on/off from the disc menu. Decent Widescreen (2.35:1) presentation of a Warner Bros 16:9 super high quality DVD make this a real treat if u don't have an HDTV. If u do, then check out the Netflix version in 1080p! -OR- U can connect your Progressive-Scan DVD player, XBOX or PS via component for optimum picture, or at least S-video connector cables. I am wondering how this high Bit-rate DVD would look upconverted on an HDTV, but ultimately it is best streamed on Netflix in HD...

The film's performances were up to par (as far as i'm concerned), I can tell the actors worked as hard as the crew to make something special. Yet apparently the studio execs meddled with the script causing the flop... :(
John Travolta was utterly convincing as Terl, the Pyschlo Chief of Security (can't picture anyone else in that role now), Forest Whitaker as his dim witted but strong assistant, & Barry Pepper as the super determined ""Jonnie Tyler"" whose high energy action scenes carry the story through most of the movie. Once the final human revolt takes place inside the native-alien atmosphere domed city of Denver, I couldn't stop watching the movie! It was that entertaining.

Overall, when this film came out in early 2000 i saw it but like everyone else could not compare it to other high-end Sci-Fi films released, like ""The Matrix"", ""Star Wars: Episode 1"", & ""The Mummy"".
So i never really liked the film. Yet last year when I viewed Battlefield Earth HD in full widescreen on my halfway decent 27"" Sylvania SDTV or Netflix equipped Sharp 40"" HDTV it was a blast! Well, that's what one person thinks anyway... :p

-My only real problem with BFE is that for some reason it was filmed using camera tilts like a comic book from the 1970's. Most of the shots are like watching TV while laying on the couch or floor, after a few moments u get used to it and it's not too bad, but they should have reduced the number of tilted shots by 50%.

Hope they release this cool flick on Blu-ray, i would definitely buy it.

1275644,3,B00003CXIU,"This movie is so awful that is is awesome.

First off, I read the book first.  Also, I really like a lot of L. Ron Hubbard's books, my favorite being the Mission Earth series.

I digress.  If you liked the book Battlefield Earth, you'll find the movie lacking of the connection to the plot & characters.  The movie is like a cheap bad wine.  You know it is bad but eventually you'll drink it because you don't have any better wine and you don't feel like leaving the house.

When this day happens and you watch the movie, you'll agree with everyone else that the movie is, possibly, the worst film ever.  However, if you do happen to have that cheap bottle of wine laying around; pop the cork and enjoy the movie for being so terrible.  The camera angles are more than over-the-top and would make a sober person dizzy.  Might as well enjoy the wine and laugh at an awfully awesome film.",1336608000,,886,4.347560975609756

Since big guys John Travolta and Forest Whitaker are the bad guys and little Berry Pepper plays the hero, people Really don't like it for that reason? though the viewer may secretly like this movie. Who knows? All I know is I liked it.

I felt the ending was a bit over optimistic. I felt the happy ending was a bit odd, that the aliens would just be really pissed off at us Earthlings who rebelled and destroyed their home world. In the book, apparently, Earth's revolt allows other alien species also ruled by the Psychlos an opportunity to revolt too. Just to say, I've never actually read the book and am not an adherent of Scientoloy. I suspect Hubbard made the religion up, probably as a joke, and that actors who profess to adhere to it might be doing so as  a means to get people begging for money from them off their backs.

1275652,2,B00003CXIU,"So I finally got around to watching Battlefield Earth, and I have to say it wasn't as bad as I expected.  Of course, given all of the abuse heaped upon this adaptation of L. Ron Hubbard's most lengthy novel, it could hardly have lived down to such low expectations.  It is certainly true that the film has some major problems - particularly Travolta's over-acting and a storyline riddled with inanities - but I can't deny that I didn't feel some measure of excitement watching humanity stand up in the face of alien aggression, and I don't think anyone will deny the fact that the special effects budget was money well spent.  Still, as Ron White likes to say, ""You can't fix stupid,"" and the storyline of Battlefield Earth is all kinds of stupid.

It doesn't say much for the Earth that it fell to the invading Psychlos in just nine minutes.  A tall, strong, and particularly vicious race of humanoids, the Psychlos are far too paranoid, conniving, and self-serving to work well together absent the discipline of military rule.  Terl (Travolta), the head of security on Earth, is the perfect embodiment of all the Psychlos' bad qualities.  Angry that his intelligence and skills are being wasted on the Earth outpost, he works out a scheme that will allow him to return home filthy rich.  Having discovered a rich deposit of gold in an irradiated area the Psychlos cannot enter, he experiments with training a small group of human slaves to mine the gold for him.  In the year 3000, humans are a desperate lot who have reverted back to Stone Age life; those not serving as slaves live in isolated pockets of arid land, knowing nothing of their history.  So convinced is Terl of humans' innate worthlessness that he gives one man, Jonnie (Barry Pepper), access to America's forgotten history after teaching him the Psychlo language.

This is where things really start getting silly.  For one thing, you have to wonder why the greedy Psychlos haven't discovered all the gold in Fort Knox, especially since someone conveniently left the vault open, after all the hundreds of years they've been there.  You also have to wonder why the ignorant humans don't say ""Where's that?"" when they're told they're going to Texas and other place names that they should have no knowledge of.  Most of all, you have to question how a bunch of illiterate, caveman-level humans can learn to fly jet aircraft in the space of a week.

There are some fun bits to the movie, such as Terl's firm belief that humans will do anything he wants when offered the delicacy of a live rat, but Travolta's overacting and tendency to burst into inane laughter at any moment tend to ruin all of his scenes.  And if I ever hear anyone else mention the word ""leverage,"" I hate to think what I might do.  The bottom line is that Battlefield Earth is a really stupid movie - but it's the kind of bad movie you can really enjoy laughing at.  Believe me - I've barely scratched the surface of this film's absolutely ludicrous foundation.  This much unintentional hilarity really shouldn't be missed.",1325376000,,3058,4.714285714285714

I would, however, put the movie in league with Plan 9 and other gems which are entertaining because of their ""badness"". I think if you had given Ed Wood $70 million and a mediocre scifi novel written by a self-aggrandizing demagogue to start with this is what you would have gotten in return. BFE was SO comically stupid in SO many places it pretty much kept you laughing and, therefore, entertained. And that is what movies are supposed to do, isn't it?? No need to delve into the bloody details of the ""plot"" of this one, such as it is. That would be like digging for deeper meaning in Robot Monster, just a waste of time. This is one cliche-riddled turkey to just sit back and enjoy.

I guess what makes this movie seem ""better"" than it's reputation would lead one to believe is the torrent of garbage which has sluiced out of Hollywood since BFE's historic flop onto the scene. EVERY movie which follows in the footsteps of Blair Witch or which attempts to look like an amateur Youtube video is worse than BFE, and not in a good way either. And a lot of them cost millions to ""produce"", to use the term loosely. If you REALLY want to lament the two hours of your life you will never get back, watch Cloverfield or anything else in it's genre, and TRY to resist the temptation to take a sharp pencil to your eyeballs. If you want to laugh until milk comes out of your nose and actually be ENTERTAINED, watch BFE. It has to be the low point for most of those involved, and some actually came back from the Dirty Sanchez this movie put on their careers to make other movies.

The human is portrayed as pretty simple, but he manages to stay one step ahead of the alien, who is devious and quick to betray anyone. It was intentionally comic.

I've never in my life walked out on a before this movie, and haven't since. I caught this being played a few years later and was just curious if it got better. It was still pretty bad.

We are lead to believe that a group of humans, who are 1 generation removed from dragging their knuckles along the ground, can beat aliens of advance tech.  The human race who were beaten in a matter of a few hours when the aliens first showed up were vastly smarter than this group of humans.  I mean these humans were riding horse as their main source of transportation, and now they can fly jets. The writing was pretty funny with the aliens calling their home planet ""home station"" or something like that.  I often wonder if while making a bad movie if the writers and actors realize what a horrible movie they are making.

Set in the year 3000, Earth is supposedly ruled by a tribe of large, strong, humanoids with dreadlocks that have enslaved humanity to mine gold from Earth's ground.  So this invites the very first question; why did the aliens come to Earth looking for gold.  The movie makes it quite clear they have advanced technology, probably advanced enough to make gold directly from nuclear fusion.  So why come to Earth?  We are never told this, but oh well.  The movie is about the rebellion of the humans as led by a white American man (who else could it be).  The aliens themselves display very human-like emotions and passions.  And the humans run around living like our ancestors probably did during the stone age.  Until they discover their ancient technologies like flying airplanes and machine guns, and suddenly master them in the space of several weeks to free themselves.  Sounds ridiculous.  Well it is, and the movie was not meant to be funny.  The biggest mystery is how could John Travolta sign up to produce and act in this dud?  Overall, stay away.

What is up with Franchise Pictures? Is that company like another Revolution Studios, making crap after crap for its entire run? They probably made a few decent hits, but I have encountered this company a little too often in certain lousy films I reviewed: ""Driven"", ""FeardotCom"", and ""Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever"".

Blame the defunctness upon themselves, since Franchise took the money from a foreign investor and didn't pay it back after the movie bombed.

So why is it bad?  Other than ripping off ""Planet of the Apes"", having spotty narrative, pretentious overwrought acting, and ho-hum special effects, it's a movie without a care in the world.  In the future, after an alien race conquered the Earth, humanity has regressed back to the era of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/10-000-B-C/dp/B0012Q732O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">10,000 B.C.</a>&nbsp;A lone wanderer (Barry Pepper) was off for food until he was captured by the same aliens, a race of lion-predators with nose-plugs from the planet Psychlo; the head of security for the alien lion-predators (or ALPs) is a flamboyant hedonist named Terl (John Travolta).  The movie then has two sides to follow, mostly on the ALPs: Terl, with the help of Kur (Forest Whitaker) by simple deceptive blackmailing, tried to farm gold from behind their superiors' back because their leaders were too prudish enough to give him a promotion; the long wanderer was detained by the same ALP, taught in the alien's language and learning the tools of the trade, while secretly planing a revolt against the aliens.  The ALPs are obnoxious, aggressive and coy beings who only care about themselves, while the human beings aren't any better as they sometimes fight against themselves over food.

The unreasonable conquerors vs. one-dimensional barbarians.  Which side did I root for?  Absolutely neither.  Terl is just too pompous to be charming, and the wanderer always has that angry scowl on his face, which frankly makes me dislike him as well.  In fact, a lot of stupid occurrences in the plot made me groan.  From the fact that Terl made the wanderer learn his language, not even thinking the so-called man-animal (or m'animal) would use the knowledge against him, to the wanderer giving the gun back to Terl after the m'animals made a successful ambush; plus, there's the part where the m'animals tried to steal gold from Fort Knox and yet for some reason the security camera (which Terl said is watching their every move) didn't caught up with their scheme, the jets that just float perfectly still in mid-air, and the fact that planet Psycholo had a flammable atmosphere yet there are shots of flames spewing from factories IN THE PLANET...and it didn't blow up from those.  Nevermind 'stupid', the plot is a series of errors.

Another bad example of filmmaking is its improper use of the angle shot. The angle shot is viewed to make a scene dynamic and exciting, but when the shot's used too much, it defeats the very intent of the diagonal aspect, making it disorienting and dull; this movie made a primary use of the shot for 90% of the movie.  I don't even know what the director is going for in that recurring camera point.  And I like how the movie just ran out of the SFX budget, as at times the crew didn't bother to show sparks from the alien guns, or how guy survive a series of blasts that just happen to miss in two straight lines. At one scene, one alien shot the other alien's hand's off; the gun didn't react to the trigger, the hand didn't explode on impact, it just happened off screen.  How cheap is that?

Plot-wise, this movie is for people who think Speed 2 is a little too ""deep."" The screenplay is so bad I convulsed from rolling my eyes. Some countries have been bombed for lesser travesties. It's a third-term, back-alley abortion.

Add in one of the most gloriously over-the-top acting performances in the history of cinema by John Travolta, and suspension of disbelief is not enough; expulsion of disbelief is required. Which is a shame, really, because the combination completely dwarfs a semi-entertaining movie with decent special effects (despite the horrible camera work shot through a lifeless blue filter the majority of the movie).

Watch B:E with the intention of making fun of it. I recommend following it up by watching a movie with a better, more believable plot, something like Armageddon.

1275793,5,B00003CXIU,"Normally a movie this bad would get at a 1 star rating on Amazon. I haven't seen a movie THIS bad. It's bad down to every last little detail. The plot, the cinematography, the acting, the special effects, the script, the music.

So why did I give it five stars? Because it's the definition of ""So bad it's fun to watch"". I mean, I even own a freaking copy of this movie for that reason. Whenever I am down and depressed and need a laugh, I put it on for a good laugh. I mean, it's really a just an extremely crappy yet hilarious movie.

Like I said, every last thing about this movie is bad as hell. For one, I have read the book and it's bad as well, it reads like it was written by a monkey going crazy with a bunch of alphabetical fridge magnets. I couldn't remember the book though before watching it so I just decided to turn my brain off for some cheesy fun. Basically, the plot is a ripoff of Star Wars (different planet, Johnny Goodboy Tyler = Luke Skywalker) and Star Trek (the amazingly dumb ""Psychlos""). The psychlos are dumb enough to refer to humans as ""Man-animals"". Which makes me think... we drive ""Car-automobiles"" and go to ""Business-work""!!! Seriously!!!! How could you not laugh at the term ""Man-animal""????

The cinematography is one thing you'd notice almost immediately. Every shot is slanted at a 45 degree angle. It takes two seconds to get annoying and just adds to the general crapiness. Also, WTF is with those double door wipe transition? When the screen double door wiped into the credits at the end, I fell on the ground laughing (literally).

The DVD has a special feature called ""Creative Special Effects"". Yeah, they're creative alright. Creatively BAD, that is. They look like they were done on a MacIntosh computer. The film is shot in 67% purple-blue filters, which also gets annoying quick.

And the acting. Barry Pepper is basically Kristen Stewart in this movie. He rarely ever changes facial expression. Travolta's ""acting"" (I use that term very loosely) consists of over-emphasizing every word (While YOU were still learning to SPELL YOUR NAME!!!! I was being TRAINED to CONQUER GALAXIES!!!!!).

The ""music"" (I also use that term loosely) is a low point too, and sounds like a boom microphone being banged against the inside of a huge metal drum.

Also, for a good laugh, watch the movie with the commentary on. I guarantee you it's even funnier listening to Roger Christian's BS excuses for the choices in direction. I love how he keeps comparing it to comic books with ""Jonnie is a Comic Strip charatcter"" and other BS like that.

1275854,2,B00003CXIU,"You still can't believe it? You still cannot believe that this was actually made? Well, it's true. Some idiot actually greenlit Battlefield: Earth back in 2000. And as a result, a total of $44 million had been wasted due to a lame story, atrocious acting, horrible writing, and some unoriginal costume & set designs. Fortunately, however, it was a disaster at the box office, and is still greatly loathed today by the general public. Unfortunately, however, I was one of those poor souls who saw this wreck in the theater. Yeah, I know. $7.50 wasted. I've seen some very bad films on the big screen, such as Batman & Robin, Wing Commander, and Burton's Planet of the Apes. But Battlefield: Earth is.....well, it's just as bad as the others.

First, let's examine the story, which has to be one of the absolute weakest in the history of sci-fi cinema. An alien race called the Psychlos (totally original, ain't it?) has conquered the human race. It is now the year 3000, and the humans are now starting to fight back with their leader named Jonnie. But the Psychlos are unaware of what's going on, because they're too stupid to notice. I mean, this alien race treat the humans like gorillas because they believe that the people of Earth are nothing but mindless animals, and lack intelligence. And yet, they never explored our entire world history. The Psychlos know nothing about the discovery of North America, World War II, or the creation of TV and the computer. They don't even know about our exploration in science and music. Shouldn't that be enough evidence that we are much smarter than we look? No, because the Psychlos are stupid. So stupid that the story is already predictable at this point. Yeah, the humans are going to defeat this alien race very easily. What a surprise. Oh, and by the way, did I mention that the motive of the Psychlos is gold? Yeah, they've conquered this planet, and all this time they never even tried to look for gold in Fort Knox. 1,000 years have gone by and this gold-infested army post has been left untouched. Like I said, they're stupid.

I can continue on about the endless plot holes, but the other reviewers here on Amazon have already pointed many of them out. So now let's talk about the look of the film. What you've heard is true. The camera is always tilted at an angle from beginning to end. Director Roger Christian must have believed that this would create a more stylish look. But no, because in actuality, it can make one sick. The tilted angle is very unnecessary if used excessively. The colors in this film are even worse. This film is full of monotonous colors. Some scenes are shot in blue and ONLY blue, while other scenes are shot in gray and brown. It starts to become irritating halfway through the film. Finally, add to all this some highly derivative costume and set designs and an overdone music score. Some of it seems borrowed--no, STOLEN--from Star Wars, Star Trek, and even Independence Day. The Psychlos look like Klingon rejects. The action scenes (particularly the spaceship/fight jet battles) look like deleted scenes from ID4. The transitions are taken straight out of Star Wars. I mean, not only is this one of the stupidest movies I have ever seen, it's also one of the most odd-looking and most unoriginal movies ever made.

What about the acting? Well, it does have a certain entertainment value. I mean, John Travolta as Terl is so over-the-top, it's actually quite amusing to watch. In fact, this movie could pass as a comedy because of Travolta. Now, to be honest, I did like Barry Pepper as Jonnie and Kim Coates as Carlo. They at least tried to put some effort into their performances. Forest Whitaker is badly miscast as Ker, but it's a good thing he bounced back with The Last King of Scotland.

Battlefield: Earth is a massive failure. Aside from Travolta's Kabuki acting & Pepper and Coates's decent performances, this movie is unentertaining. The ridiculous story, the tilted camera angles, the monotonous colors, the unoriginal sets and costumes, and the annoying music score are just some of the things that can affect your positive outlook on life. If you're looking for a sci-fi film that has a solid plot and some good performances, then avoid this one. You'll feel depressed if you don't.

1275857,1,B00003CXIU,"I have seen various reviews of this film adaptation of L. Ron Hubbarb's sci-fi novel, Battlefield Earth, and from the notoriously negative reviews; Richard Roeper, Roger Ebert, The Nostalgia Critic, the works, with numerous Razzie wins. When it became available to watch instantly on Netflix, I decided to see it out of curiosity's sake yesterday. And as it turns out, the critics were right! This is one of the worst, most god-awful science fiction movies of all time! I will address the flaws as we go along. Here is the premise. In the year 2000, the planet Earth was seized by aliens from the opposing planet Psychlo. They have enslaved humanity to search for gold. Sounds like Elementary School style fan fiction, doesn't it? 1,000 years later, a village tribesman Jonnie ""Goodboy"" Tyler (Barry Pepper) decides to leave the village to hunt for food and comes across another tribe, who were kidnapped by the Psychlos. Something you will notice very quickly about this movie is that 95% of the camera shots are at an angle, which feels like the camera is sinking in quicksand. Jonnie then meets Security Chief Terl (John Travolta in a role that obscures and wastes his talent) and his partner-in-crime Ker (Forest Whitaker) who plot to train the humans in secret, buy their way off Earth, and keep the gold for themselves, despite being really stupid and hardly know anything about humans. They don't know what we eat, how we live, or our language. No joke. The language system can get pretty confusing at times. The Psychlos can sometimes appear to speak our language, when at others they actually use their native speech in a human's perspective. I think this is so we won't read as many subtitles if you are lazy and just want to watch the movie, but they sometimes have the subtitles anyway. Why not just do a better job at keeping the languages separate. I can make do with a little reading. When they use a machine to give Jonnie information about the Psychlos and teach them how to use weapons and space-pods, they don't see this as a recipe for disaster. And they could already teach them their language? Why didn't they do that before because you can talk to them and learn so much. They can get a little lazy as well. How do they monitor the humans when they mine? A small camera pod flies over and takes a still picture every few hours. Why not just use a video camera to record footage instead of plain photos? Jonnie comes up with a plan to take back the planet. He learns everything he can about human history, the idiotic aliens and their weakness. Within two weeks, they find Ft Knox and give some of its gold to Terl, while they learn how to arm weapons, build bombs, and how to fly fighter jets. While that is going on, Terl mingles with his real-life wife (what the Nostalgia Critic and I mean is that she was played by Kelly Preston, John Travolta's wife). Then, the humans launch a surprise attack at the Psychlo base. So that means that six jets were able to combat an alien army, but an entire military in the past were only able to put up a measly 9-minute fight? The memory machine must have been a fatal disadvantage. By the way, just a random question, but how were the humans able to find fuel for the jets? If 1,000 years went by without the jets being used, the gasoline would have been of no use and the jets would have been ruined. I guess the military drained the gas and stored it away for when the time is right. Convoluted, isn't it? In a very jumbled climax, Jonnie confronts and defeats Terl by blowing his arm off. The human blow up the base and the Psychlos suffocate. I forgot to mention that the Psychlos can't breathe Earth's atmosphere and the same can be said for the humans in Psychlo's radioactive and flammable atmosphere. One of them also plans to beam a bomb to the Psychlo's planet. The explosion would be small, but due to its air design, it wiped out the entire planet forever in the most idiotically simple of all world destructions. So let me get this straight, Psychlo has an atmosphere made of radiation has never had a single explosion? If the humans learned about this before, then Psychlo would have been destroyed to begin with. How stupid could they get?! Terl and Ker survive of Earth, but face different fates. Terl is used as a hostage for other Psychlo colonies to rescue, while Ker has a change in heart and disses Terl to help the humans. One of the writers, J.D. Shapiro, wanted this movie to be dark and edgy, with a more interesting story and a far more serious tone. However, Franchise Pictures decided to dumb down on the source material in order to appeal to children. That ultimately failed. The acting was so ridiculous and plagued with corny dialogue. John Travolta was so over-the-top goofy that he would be better off as Jonnie instead of the bland Barry Pepper. Despite this, I think Forest Whitaker was the only actor who was at least trying. Think about it. Ker joins the humans in the end, Pepper wins the Worst Supporting Actor Razzie, while Whitaker only got a nomination, and he still had a career after this. The overuse of Dutch angles can get sickening and give you a neck cramp. The plot was really simple-minded, convoluted, and uninteresting and it has nothing to do with Scientology, logic, or reason. The alien race is one of the dumbest in film history. The visual effects are average as well, nothing special. It uses cheap CGI, the sets look grungy and depressing, and the Psychlo makeup looks so silly with long hair and claw-like nails. I can now see why see why it was hated by many critics I know, because it was so messed up. If any of the cast and crew read this review, I am so sorry all this had to happen. Thanks a lot, Franchise Pictures! You ruined everything!

P.S.  The Nostalgia Critic since then realized that the Psychlos' home planet's atmosphere actually consisted of a reactive gas that radiation would set off, via a nuclear explosion, but due to the confusing dialogue and another plothole on how the more peaceful mankind came up with nuclear fusion before the violent-happy Psychlos did when it should have been the other way around in order to take logic into consideration, I initially thought the Critic was right.

What I saw was a post apocalyptic society being dominated by aliens (Psychlos)  that were one wink and a nod from doing away with all of humanity.  I am attracted to post apocalyptic story's and end of the world tales. This movie was both rolled into one. I thought John Travolta and Forrest Whitaker performances playing selfish sadistic overlords were excellent. I enjoyed the way the movie portrayed their greed and glee in humiliating underlings which was evidently a character trait of their species.
  Yes evil is a bad thing, but it's fun to watch. I enjoyed the evil Psychlos because of their uninhibited greed, their Leering, their non stop gloating, their tendency to betray, their infinity to dominate, their complete lack of compassion and empathy along with their amoral cruelty. There were all kinds of problems with the movie such as the over acting. I am also not fan of the story's author, Ron Hubbard. I did however enjoy the dark humor and greed portrayed portrayed but the Psychlos. A lot of what occurs within the film is ridiculous.

1275862,2,B00003CXIU,"I know, I know...

Gaping plot holes, cheesy lines, ridiculous coincidences, hammy acting, lack of faithfulness to the novel (which, although no classic, was apparently much more sensible than this)....'Battlefield Earth' is certainly not a good movie. However, the reviewers slamming it as the worst movie ever made are wrong. It is certainly deeply flawed, but it does have a certain cheesy attraction.

The biggest problem lies not so much with the film itself, but the fact that it takes itself so seriously. If 'Battlefield Earth' were simply another pulp blockbuster like 'Independence Day', you could probably forgive alot of the stupidity on display here. But this movie so obviously sets out to be something ""Big"" and important. Check out the ""making of"" section of the DVD; the cast and crew really do seem to think they're making the next '2001' here. So instead of being able to laugh off the implausibilities in the story, the movie's self-important seriousness forces us to notice them, emphasising over and over again the leaps in logic and cavernous holes in the plot. The gap between the creators' ambitions and the eventual outcome is hilariously wide, and you can only wonder why nobody thought to ask how cavemen can fly a plane in a week, or books and fuel kept for 1000 years are in perfect working order.

Many people bag John Travolta's role, but I actually think his slightly self-conscious hamminess comes closest to what the film should have been. It's Barry Pepper's leaden performance that really drags this film into the depths, making ridiculous scenes even more cringeworthy with his po-faced earnestness. You just have to laugh at his deadly serious attempts to teach cavemen trigonometry, for example. Even worse, the director seems desperate to make a major artistic statement (because this film is going to be the new '2001', remember?), so he employs a variety of tilted angles, extreme close-ups, partial-scene, and other distorted camera effects which are just annoying.

So if you are after a genuine, thought-provoking sci-fi film, then look elsewhere.

However....'Battlefield Earth' is entertaining to an extent, provided you just take it as a cheesy B-grade sci-fi flick and not the big budget flop it was. The movie works alot better if you just surrender to its stupidity instead of fighting it.",1255737600,4,2341,5.0859375

1275905,1,B00003CXIU,"Well, poodles, Once more I returned home after a relaxing facial and manicure only to find that little Jimmy jr. had yet again poisoned the family DVD player with some heinous assault called BATTLEFIELD EARTH. How he managed to bribe his Germanic  governess Mrs. Whipcrack to remove his fetters and take him to the local video store is still under investigation. (I would have thought this beyond her. She claimed to be former Gestapo on her resume.) With my freshly painted nails digging into my palms, and a growing concern for the I.Q. of my youngest son, I sat down to witness what could quite possibly be the worst movie of the new millennium.

Released to scathing reviews in the summer of 2000, one could only hope that BATTLEFIELD EARTH was, as many paranoid trogs would have it, a subliminal recruitment for the L. Ron Hubbard religion/carpetbagging operation, because then it might have some purpose. Otherwise, it is a brain-baking travesty, a Hollywood laughingstock that must inevitably damn at least some of the careers wrapped up in it. It's difficult to imagine how John Travolta, (whose personal project this was in one way or another), got away with his reputation and price tag intact. As a Rasta-coiffed alien in six-finger fur gloves and big Gene Simmons boots prone to drinking what looks like Gatorade at his local alien gin mill, Travolta utters dialogue only LOST IN SPACE's Dr. Smith could get away with, including multiple exclamations about Earth being ""this horrid planet!"" Much to his hammy dismay, Travolta's Terl is stuck on Earth monitoring its security after the Psychlos have essentially wiped out civilization and are busy strip-mining the planet.

Jonnie (Barry Pepper) gets captured by the Psychlos; when Terl decides to surreptitiously have ""man-animals"" mine gold for personal profit, he slaps Jonnie into a brain-educating machine, not realizing that Jonnie has a Captain Kirk-like need to be free. The revolution takes forever to happen, and director Roger Christian's 45-degree angles, hyper-closeups and hemorrhaging slo-mo shots virtually comprise a textbook in how to make an irritating, ineffective and dull action film. Unarguably the dumbest sci-fi novel ever to be a bestseller in this country (if it was one - anti-Hubbardians think there's a warehouse full of paperbacks somewhere), BATTLEFIELD EARTH makes it to the screen with its nova-sized plot holes (caveman learning how to formation-fly Harriers in a few days!), glaring inconsistencies (""Six Psychlos coming fast!""; cut to six aliens walking very slowly) and slackjawed foolishness intact.

Don't even get me going on the Fort Knox debacle, or Kelly Preston's cameo as an alien trollop with a foot-long tongue, or Pepper's portentous reading of the Declaration of Independence. I haven't seen such a laughably incompetent summer movie since summer movies became summer movies some years ago, and that's saying a pantload. As to Mrs. Whipcrack, we have a special room in our basement for people who don't follow orders. Perhaps she might enjoy a little visit down there next to our sloppy gardener Mr. Chu.",1248134400,16,3115,5.1623762376237625
1275906,3,B00003CXIU,"I went into this movie fully expecting for it to be horrible.  Mike Nelson of MST3K fame did a RiffTrax on it, it is constantly made fun of.  Even the cover indicates stinkitude:  the only review on the back of the case is (literally) from JoBlo's movie blog!  It can't get any lower than this.  So naturally, I had to see what the fuss was about.

I have a personal theory on this:  the writer(s) of this film had ADD.  Hear me out...

The first hour is absolutely incomprehensible.  They introduce our protagonist, who has no name, rides a horse, and attempts to attack a mini-golf dragon and is dragged into an abandoned mall and is captured by John Travolta, who is given a name almost instantly (Terl), and makes him do things with other captured people with absolutely no explanation.  The writer is clearly hyper at this point, but I suspect at 42 mins realizes this and takes a pill to calm himself down.

From 1:00 to 1:30, the movie begins to make sense.  Our protagonist is given education, and all of a sudden he begins to make sense and you learn what the heck Terl is up to.  They discover Fort Hood and Harriers.  The protagonist is even named!  The pill is clearly working.

But the pill clearly wears off from 1:30 to the end, the nonsensicalness/hyperness of the plot returns and the film becomes a blur of SFX.

At the end of my first watching, yes, this is dreck.  However, for kicks and background noise, I put on the commentary and watched it again immediately afterwards.  And I realized a number of things:

1.  The movie was trying to follow the book, methinks, very closely.
2.  It makes sense for the first hour that your confused as all get out.  Because, our protagonist is.  The last 30 minutes, though, cannot be excused.  So the plot is horrendous and the writing is to blame.
3.  It's kinda funny; a number of jokes are made on the lack of knowledge of future humans.
3.  The director of this film has an impressive history (Star Wars ep IV as set designer), wanted to make a film on a book by LRH, and had a very small budget.  He somehow got a Canadian crew and SFX team to make a B- movie with big name actors on a shoestring budget, and the commentary revealed this, and it was really neat to learn about all of the work he put in.  His academic integrity and ability to explain what was going on was really informative.  He also explained a lot of subtle jokes that were made about the humans not understanding common skills we have today.

So while I wouldn't consider this movie entertaining, it is informative.",1247270400,3,2551,4.419354838709677

1275908,1,B00003CXIU,"I heard about this movie when it came out nine years ago and haven't seen it until last week.  I remember seeing stuff about it when it was released and everyone rightfully said ""You don't want to see that, it's one of the worst movies of all time.""  I saw this last Friday and I wasn't expecting this to be any good at all, I saw it because this has so much notoriety surrounding it, I just had to see how loathsome it was with my own eyes.  Trust me, every bad thing you heard about Battlefield Earth is 100% true.

I won't judge the movie on religious matters, I'll judge it strictly on a cinematic level.  Basically, the plot is that an invading alien race called the Psychlos (really creative names) have conquered Earth and the humans, who are living caveman-like lives, are fighting back.

I'll get the one good quality out of the way.  I do believe that Barry Pepper really did put effort into his role, despite the fact that everyone else phoned in their performances, so I have to give him some credit there.  Everything else is terrible, and I'll categorize every bad quality neatly.

BAD ACTING:

Minus the performance of Barry Pepper as human resistance leader Jonnie Goodboy Tyler, everyone else put NO effort into their roles.  I felt like John Travolta as Terl knew that this movie would be the rightful whipping boy of movie critics and audiences alike and gave out one of the most laughable performances in a big budget movie.  He's supposed to be the head of security on Earth and supposed to be really smart and evil, he's neither.  He makes the stock villains in the 60's Batman TV show look like Dr. Weir in Event Horizon in comparison.  If Terl is supposed to be really smart, how is he so stupid as to allow a handful of ""man animals"" learn to use Psychlo technology (which would screw him and his race over) and doesn't even know what humans eat?  He even finds this out by putting a few ""man animals"" in a little hunt to find and eat rats for crying out loud!!

PLOT HOLES:

Oh man, there's numerous plot holes bigger than the Grand Canyon throughout this cinematic mess.  For one, Terl explains to Jonnie that the Psychlos defeated all of the armies on Earth in nine minutes circa 2000 but towards the end of the movie, a handful of cavemen with horribly outdated weaponry defeat the invading Psychlos and destroy their home planet.  You mean to tell me that the most advanced fighting forces from powerful nations like America, Russia, China, and the UK got their butts handed to them by the Psychlos but a few cavemen were able to destroy practically the entire Psychlo race with really inferior weapons?  Also, note that 1000 years prior to the movie's setting that the Psychlos almost certainly had weapons and vehicles that were technologically inferior to the ones in the current setting so that makes it even more implausible that Jonnie and his comrades were able to beat the Psychlos.  Also, the destroyed cities are in really good condition despite laying there abandoned for 1000 years.  Books in the library are merely dusty and isn't it really convenient how the Harrier jets, machine guns, and bombs are in perfect working condition at Fort Hood and waiting for Jonnie and his men to be used?  There's even electricity in Ft. Hood!!  Wouldn't you think that after 1000 years the light bulbs and computers that were still left on after it was abandoned would burn out after about a week?  My favorite part has to be where Jonnie devises a plan to steal a bunch of gold bars from Fort Knox and I can't get over how the gold is just waiting there for Jonnie and his crew to be taken.  Wouldn't you think people would have looted Ft. Knox after it was abandoned and way before the movie's setting?  The only thing more nonsensical than this is Elfen Lied.

BAD CAMERA WORK:

Practically every shot in this movie is at an angle.  Didn't Roger Christian complete film class 101?  Angled shots in movies are effective only when used in moderation.  I swear, I saw probably one, maybe two shots in this movie that weren't angled.

BAD COSTUME DESIGN:

I'm not really that picky when it comes to how costumes look in movies, but the Psychlo costumes are absolutely atrocious!!  The platform boots are so obvious that it kills any suspension of disbelief that you might have that the Psychlos look relatively legitimate in a fictional world.  Besides the stupid platform boots, they look like pathetic humanoid Wookies.

STATUS AS A ""CAMPY"" MOVIE:

Some people have called this a camp-classic, I can't disagree with them more.  ""Camp"" status only applies to low budget works like Plan 9 from Outer Space and the original La Blue Girl hentai because of obvious production shortcomings and the whole ""so bad it's good"" vibe prevailing throughout the whole thing.  Battlefield Earth is just ""so bad it's bad"" because this wasn't low budget, this had a multi-million dollar and it was a BOMB!!

People rave that this is one of the worst movies ever and that it was a piece of junk that should never have been made. I watched it for myself and I was impressed. First of all the story's plot line was nothing new to me. Earth being overrun by vicious aliens and humans fighting back to save their planet. That's a great plotline because I love post-apocalyptic stories. This one may not be as great as The Stand, Waterworld, or The Postman, but it must be seen to be believed. John Travolta may not be at his best here but at least he plays a villain and that's what he's probably best at. He was a good villain in Face/Off and The Punisher, but I find him a little more comical here. Hell he keeps calling the humans ""RAT BRAINS""! The film's special effects were not really that bad and were pretty cool. The final battle scenes were not entirely terrific but were enough to keep me entertained. I heard the book was really good and I don't know where the movie fell flat of it's demands. I heard that it was hard to turn a lengthy book into a near 2-hour flick. I can see that as tough. The movie did have a good ending and that may be one of the best things of the movie. Enough with the movie and let's talk about the DVD. First, it has absolutely one of the coolest pictures I've ever seen. The extras are awesome but the film's theatrical trailer is worth watching for the choir music there. You will feel like you're in an epic adventure. Gotta love choir music. Without that there would be no epic adventure films. As for the movie, you may want to give it a second chance.

Though some people have called it that, I suspect that it is a bit premature, since it was released in the year 2000 and there is still one hundred years to go until the next century. In fact, as science fiction films go, it was OK, and it was pretty entertaining. I think a lot of the criticism was due to a back lash against the author, who founded a religion that some call a cult--I'm sure you've heard of it, and if you haven't, here's a coupon for a free Personality Test.

There were some things that made it hard to suspend your disbelief, if you want to nit pick, but hey, it was science fiction. The dreadlocks on aliens Terl (John Travolta) and Ker (Forest Whitaker) was one cringe worthy element, kind of like watching Jar Jar Binks, you squirm in your seat wondering what was the director thinking? Is this movie slightly racist? Another thing, they had these clips on their noses that were supposed to help them breath, but just looked like they were on the swim team in high school.

But I 'liked' Forest and Travolta's take on the alien Psychlos. Travolta especially. He was just kind of a scary goofball, a combination of cunning intelligence and dumb as a bag of hammers. In short, he was Oh So Travolta.

--------------------------
Terl: Ker, I'd like you to meet Chirk.
[Ker grunts appreciatively]
Terl: She's, um... she's, um...
Chirk: His soon-to-be newly acquired secretary.
Terl: Yes.
Ker: [eagerly] Really?
Terl: [quietly, to Ker] She's stupid enough not to be a menace, good-looking enough to be decorative; she gets drunk with economical speed...
Terl: [normal voice] - and has other advantages.
[Chirk extends her very long tongue]
Ker: Ooh. I can see that.
==========================================

There were moments of humor that were actually intentional. Like, the humans left on earth tell tales of past glory, where you would cross through Golden Arches and food would magically appear. Or, speaking of food, Terl was somehow under the impression that humans loved to eat rats, since he witnessed some starving ones forced to do that by hunger.

-----------------
Terl: You... Hungry, little fella? Want some rat? It's good!
=======================================

The sound track was interesting, composed by Elia Cmiral (pronounced ""Smear all"") from Czechoslovakia; it probably would have been better received if it had not been smeared with all the stigma of this controversial film. Cmiral also composed soundtracks for 'Ronin' and 'Stigmata.' As I researched this film, I read about a soundtrack for the book, 'Battlefield Earth: A Saga of the Year 3000' that was composed by its author, L. Ron Hubbard. But that isn't the film soundtrack--still, it is interesting that Hubbard, in addition to everything else composed music. I have not heard it, but for the curious, it is called 'Space Jazz.'

Though 'Battlefield Earth: A Saga of the Year 3000' is not the worst movie ever made, in my humble opinion, I'd still love to see it skewered on 'Mystery Science Theater 3000' by Tom Servo and Crow T. Robot. For those unfamiliar with MST3k, it is a science fiction spoof where a crew aboard a space ship is forced to watch the worst movies ever made, and the viewer sees their shadows along the bottom, as if you are sitting one row behind them in a theater, as they make snide comments about the movie. Now that is something I'd buy a ticket for.

1275979,1,B00003CXIU,"""Exterminate all man-animals at will, and happy hunting!"" So bellows Terl, played ridiculously over-the-top by John Travolta, in an attempt to quell an uprising of humans on the slave planet Earth circa 3000 AD.

This film has absolutely nothing to recommend it as a serious science fiction movie, but viewers seeking depraved camp value will find numerous unintentionally hilarious elements in abundance. The film, adapted from L. Ron Hubbard's novel, tells the tale of Terl and his followers from the planet Psychlo (clever huh?) using the Earth for resources (especially gold) and slave labor. Barry Pepper plays Terl's chief human (or ""man-animal"") nemesis in a film so incoherent and vapid, that I had to wonder what his agent promised him in return for his screen presence. Terl is the chief of security on Earth, and is very upset that he is sentenced to remain on Earth due to a dalliance with a Psychlo senator's daughter, prompting him to become extremely deranged and psychotic. The film has ill-executed anti-capitalism sentiments, the merits of which I would debate if it was worth the effort: as it is the film collapses under its own ponderous and pretentious weight, rendering all serious debate a moot point.

Eventually Terl teaches selected man-animals to do various tasks (fly spaceships, run complex mining machinery, etc.) with the thought of making himself richer, ultimately desiring to remove the gold from Fort Knox. It turns out that perhaps they shouldn't have taught the man-animals much, as they quickly become adept at waging war on the Psychlos in CGI scenes that go on seemingly forever. (Have I mentioned the film is quite long and seems even longer?) I laughed out loud when I saw the man-animals find a perfectly intact AV-8B Harrier simulator (complete with electricity) and a squadron of Harriers at their disposal, all perfectly preserved after 1,000 years of unprepared storage. As an aside here, as a former military pilot I am familiar with many types of aircraft and know many people who have flown the Harrier: please note that it is one of the most difficult aircraft to master according to everyone I have ever known who has flown it. Terl relates that when the Psychlos invaded the Earth the combined militaries of the planet were defeated in nine minutes. It will come as no surprise, then, that this self-educated band of aviators has no difficulty whatsoever defeating the Psychlos in combat: they are such good self-taught combatants they are even able to destroy the entire planet of Psychlo itself. As if this wasn't enough to give viewers a bout of terminal eye-rolling, Terl ultimately becomes a prisoner (this is what heavy-handed Hubbard apparently thought of as ""irony"") in a prison of gold.

This is a big budget, big name movie that is a big flop in every way other than unintentional comedy. Never in William Shatner's life did he overact like Travolta; never has a movie rested its fate on such lengthy passages of middling CGI; and never before has a cult made itself such a laughingstock with a single motion picture. There are many extras, most of which are full of shallow and self-absorbed introspection about the genius underlying the film and the film itself. There's also a commentary with director Roger Christian, but I couldn't stand sitting through the movie again, so I declined that option.

If you want to watch a totally embarrassing squandering of talent and money, I highly recommend ""Battlefield Earth"".",1212710400,12,3484,5.001724137931035
1275980,4,B00003CXIU,"I guess this is the product of John Travolta being a scientologist and more or less worshipping L. Ron Hubbard, who wrote the book on which this movie is based and also started Scientology, but I have to admit that it was kind of fun to watch the first time I saw part of it on cable. Maybe it was just by comparison since just about everything that had been on was really bad. I for some reason hadn't really thought it so overt how absurd it all was, though when I watched it again yesterday I was amazed. Ed Wood would have been proud to have made this movie.

First of all, the aliens are so fantastically naive it's simply unbelievable. They merrily think humans (which look practically identical to them - at least the males do, but hey, they had to get Travolta to still look like Travolta so I guess that they had to do it that way) are completely devoid of anything resembling an intellect. A point which I more or less agree with them on, but they exaggerate it a bit far. For example, Travolta's character finds it hard to believe that a human would be capable of figuring out how to pull the trigger on a gun near the beginning of the film - and yet then he later demonstrates his knowledge that 1000 years earlier, humans had a technological civilization with which they posed admittedly feeble resistance against the Aliens when they conquered Earth. But an airplane is an airplane and a bomb is a bomb. If they were capable of making such things, and his character knew that, he shouldn't have looked down on them QUITE so much and underestimated their threat so thoroughly. At another time, he concludes that humans like to eat rats live, that they must be a favorite food, because Travolta's character witnesses the main character do that after he was set in the mountains without supplies and had gone 3 days without food and nothing else was available. I am sorry but superior aliens wouldn't be so dense. They are unfathomably naive and yet they think the humans are still significantly dumber than they are.

That was the biggest mistake. The most absurd one. Other ridiculousness abounded as well. For instance, gold is pretty abundant in the cosmos, it's just rare on the Earth's surface because it's so dense, that most of the gold on Earth has sunk to its core - it would be MUCH more effective to mine asteroids. A typical 5-mile wide metal (as opposed to rocky) asteroid on humanity's precious metals markets would be worth TRILLIONS of dollars. It will probably have at least .01% and may be as much as 1% gold (as is the Earth's core) and may be several percent iridium! It's downright silly for us to value gold, platinum and iridium the way we do, and it's just a consequence of it being rare in the Earth's crust, and it should be practically worthless to a spacefaring civilization. The rare earth metals, like erbium, terbium, samarium, or the rare light elements like lithium or beryllium, that I could understand. Even silver is rarer than gold in the cosmos! Also, I had a VCR that lasted 20 years and that was simply astonishing. What do you think the odds are that a Harrier jet will be functional after sitting unattended for 1000 years? It'd be a heap of rust. It would be a pile of aluminum and iron and titanium ore. Finally, WHAT could their breathing gases possibly be? There's nothing that reacts in such a way to radiation, save maybe a mixture of hydrogen and fluorine. If their atmosphere reacted in such a way to the puny amount of radiation released by a single A-bomb, it should have exploded eons ago. Earth as well as any other similar planet in the universe is bombarded on a daily basis by cosmic rays with energies far greater than can be attained in the best particle accelerators. Energies so great they are believed to generate tiny black holes on impact at times! And radiation so abundant that it is a MIRACLE that all the men who landed on the moon survived. It all comes from distant supernovas and hypernovas and at times it's as bright as the sun. If their planet would literally explode from such a miniscule amount of radioactivity, it should be long gone.

So it's not good on the science side OR on the fiction side, but for some reason when you put together the bad science with the bad fiction, strangely enough, it's actually watchable. You can kill 2 hours with this movie and it's not the worst way to spend 2 hours. I understand this movie is on the top 10 list of movies which lost the most amount of money ever. Right along with Ishtar and Pluto Nash (now THAT was a great movie). I guess they spent way too much on it and it's just not worth what they put into it.

1276073,1,B00003CXIU,"Some enterprising psychology student could probably make an interesting study of: Why do we like horrendously bad movies? Ed Wood's notoriously, hilariously bungled cinematic efforts are cult classics precisely because of their obvious gaffes: Scenes shot half in and half out of daylight, a police lieutenant adjusting his hat brim with his service revolver, actors who can barely speak English bumping into the set...

And Battlefield Earth is pretty much right up that same alley, but much bigger, grander, more ambitious and spectacular. Its larger budget, big-studio production values, modern special effects, and recognizable ""name"" actors and writers, only combine to make the resulting crashing lead-balloon thud that much more dramatic. If Ed Wood's classic ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" is akin to that old vintage black and white footage of a 7-decker airplane collapsing under its own weight as it tries to take off, Battlefield Earth, in comparison and by virtue of its greater size and ambition, is more like a 747 colliding with the Space Shuttle. And like any great disaster, no matter how horrified we are, we feel compelled to look.

During my first viewing of Battlefield Earth, there was one brief shining moment when I actually managed to recover a bit from stunned disbelief, close my hanging-open jaw, and say, ""Well, maybe this isn't ALL bad."" Unfortunately, at that moment one of the dreadlocked aliens came on screen and began to speak, and the blissful respite was quickly shattered. Ah yes, the aliens... Fans of Star Trek: The Next Generation may recall the episode where the Ferengi first appeared. The Ferengi, we were told, were the most feared race in the galaxy, ruthless, vicious, overpowering. But when they first appeared on screen, the Ferengi turned out instead to be these sniveling little dweebs, something out of Attack of the Killer Accountants and Small Business Owners. Star Trek, to its credit, recovered from this misstep in subsequent episodes by backpedaling away from the nonsense about the Ferengi's fearsome military might, and instead doing some exploration of their profit-centered culture. No such luck here. Substitute the word ""leverage"" for ""profit"", add makeup that makes the aliens look like over-the-hill punk rockers on a bad hair day, and John Travolta grinning like a guest star on Happy Days, and you get the Psychlos of Battlefield Earth. And lest you think that things might improve when the Psychlos aren't around (they are, after all, only in ninety-eight percent of the film) the human characters don't come off all that much better.

You aren't even safe when NOBODY is on the screen. The opening title credits look like they were done by a ten-year old with dry transfer lettering. And the music... I have, of course, read commentaries roasting the music along with every other aspect of Battlefield Earth. Speaking as a composer, I don't find the film score to be that bad in and of itself. But the opening scene, flying over the desert expanses of conquered Earth, accompanied by this powerfully dramatic, epic music, makes you think you're going to be watching Out of Africa. That same music with a film like, well, like Battlefield Earth, sounds melodramatic and pretentious, and it becomes a hapless contributor to the whole incredible mishmash. That nagging feeling of distaste and queasiness is enhanced further by the fact that the entire film -- every scene, every shot -- is shot with the camera tilted at an angle. If you suffer from motion sickness, don't forget your Dramamine.

But these laughable, painfully bad aspects of the film are, fortunately, completely overshadowed by the fact that the plot, writing, and dialogue are even worse.

So please don't waste your hard-earned nickels to obtain Battlefield Earth in hopes of getting anything resembling a good movie that anyone in their right mind would want to watch. Yet, seeing this film is definitely entertaining. It's like a highway pile-up that you don't have to feel guilty about staring at as you drive slowly by. Why DO we enjoy the worst of the worst films? If nothing else, watching Battlefield Earth will make you feel that even YOU could make a better movie.

They are the only movies that ever made me cry. Cry with laughter, that is.

I was wrong. Battlefield Earth has entered the anti-pantheon of the color era. You can forget the over-rated Gigli, Showgirls and the like. They simply can't measure up. Battlefield Earth stands alone in modern Hollywood history. It has all the elements of a classic: outrageous costumes, goofy special effects, disjointed and jarring directing, astounding ham acting, lines you will want to speak along with and repeat in everyday conversation for their sheer idiocy, and preposterous concepts and plotting.

Above all else, it has that rarest of traits, the one that defines the true anti-classic: consistency. Ordinary good-bad movies only have three or four really great anti-scenes in them. Almost every single scene in Battlefield Earth is deeply ridiculous. This movie is almost like a satire of humanity itself.

Thankfully what I got was a partial mess.  I'll start with poor aspects.  The plot was completely awful.  In contrast to the book's tightly constructed plot and richly detailed story, the audience of this movie are presented with an incomprehensible collection of stilted dialougue and  unresolved plot points.  How anyone who has not read the book can be expected ro begin to follow this story, I don't know.  In addition to the plot problems we are also presented with many weak and underdevelopeed characters, namely all the humans except Johnny.

Despite the major flaws, Battlefield Earth is still very watchable.  Visually the film is a triumph.  The scenery is brilliant, especially the Psychlo compound and home planet.  In fact, everything related to the Psychlos is well executed.  All of the Pschlo make-up is great, and planet director Numph's is particularily well done.

1276082,2,B00003CXIU,"WARNING: MOVIE SPOILER BELOW!!!

I confess that my primary reason for buying a copy of this film, is grounded in recent history. I was around in the early 80s, when L. Ron Hubbard and his Scientologists were going full-bore with the logistics of making the book into a movie (the hero depicted on the original edition of the paperback looked like Chuck Norris, or so I thought), when all of a sudden Hubbard died, and the whole project apparently fell apart. Back then, I was close to 20 years old and I was curious about whatever it was that these Scientologists were turned on to that was supposed to help improve a person's quality of life... then I read about Larry Wollersheim's 1985 lawsuit. You can figure the rest out for yourself.

Anyhow, oh, yeah, the movie... the storyline is your basic alien invasion number, i.e., the Invaders arrived to make life miserable for the poor humans (in this film, the aliens look a lot like the Klingons from Star Trek), until your typical dashing young male hero organizes a band of his fellow humans to rise up and tell the Invaders to get off of our planet. Pretty simple and straightforward, but hey, there are other films MUCH worse than Battlefield Earth, and they've taught me that if you have good enough special effects, even the lamest sci-fi storylines can work!

The thing that stood out about this film, though, was its reliance on everyday talk and contemporary cliches for much of its dialogue, and as a result, it came across as rather corny... a film to be recommended for its comedy value, rather than for things like epic space battle scenes. Also, the ""bad guy"" aliens use some sort of psychic power to interfere with the minds of their human subjects, in order to keep them from organizing revolts... I must say, trying to depict mind-manipulation effects on film does pretty much the same thing to the movie as varnish stripper does when applied to a CD---it turns it into a confusing, incomprehensible mess! A couple of times, the picture would break up into a concentric blur, and I'd wonder what the heck was supposed to be going on.

How the makers of this film ever talked a great studio like Warner to help them film it, is something which will forever remain a mystery to me. I remember just before this picture opened, a group of Scientologists were trying to hype it: ""oh, watch---this film is going to be bigger than Star Wars and Gone With the Wind combined!""

- Barry Pepper as hero Jonnie 'Goodboy' Tyler was downright perfect in his role, couldn't ask for better

- John Travolta was very convincing (and funny) as the maniacal Terl

- Kim Koates as Carlo was another personal fave of mine (Koates played that hilarious ""Half an hour, half an hour"" sex-starved guy in Waterworld. Heh, gotta love him)

- Richard Tyson as ""The Wild Woodsman"" was another great character. Fans of the movie Three O'Clock High will remember him as the school bully, Buddy. He was also the bad guy in Kindergarten Cop. He usually plays villains so it was nice to see him in this role

When one reads the writing of failed Scienfiction writer L. Ron Hubbard, it's easy to see why this movie flopped. His writings are that of a babbling child - So the fact this movie sucks, is actually keeping with the traditions of L. Ron Hubbard and Scientology. The chances of taking any of his writing and turning them into a successful movie, would be near impossible.

As for those who actually liked this film? I suppose these are the same people who think Kevin Trudeau writes epic novels.

John Travolta? This is his worst movie of all time, but then like most Hollywood celebrities: Commonsense is something he apparently lacks.

The plot holes in this story are so big it would take me longer to explain just how stupendous they are than the movie would last.  Another plot hole is that the aliens come to earth to mine all of our gold, but for some reason they never check Fort Knox!?!  How the hell did they survive to become some sort of superior race?

The movie that couldn't - many say. Laughed at by others. This is a movie that sadly isn't to be faulted for its story. Its more to be faulted for poor production, cinematic adaptation and direction.

First - any good storyteller must lay the foundation in which brings people into the movie. From the get-go we get a couple paragraphs about Earth and then we are whisked away to a tribe in the Rocky Mountains. Its not the smoothest entry into the events of the movie. It would've have been a better scenario giving some visuals of Earth as the Psychlos took over a millenium ago. Then introducing us to Johnny right as he left to gather his father medicine would've set the stage nicely.

Second - I don't think Johnny was protrayed well in the beginning. The actor does a hell of a job to rescue the writing. However, introducing him as a young man who missed giving his father medicine and critized by his tribe. I don't think was flattering. There could've been a much better set up in who he was and where he was at.

Third - Travolta. I've never been a fan of Travolta. Mediocre actor at best. He's far too campy in this role. He is about as intimidating as a flea. Terrible miscasting job.

Fourth - The Jets. Now, I can go along with Ft. Hood having power still for the simulator albeit unlikely. Bases have internal power availible. However, jets flying after 1000 years? Thats just rediculous. Where'd the jet fuel come from? From some 1000 year old stockpile - ludicrious.

This movie is bad, but I don't say so for the usual reasons. There is a story here and a quite interesting one. Humanity fighting back from the verge of extinction while being brutally opressed by a alien species here on Earth. Could've been extremely interesting.

It fails though. The story clunks along especially in the set up. The direction, the casting faux pas and the attempted stylish star wars bows just do not work.

Its a fascinating watch for what could've been done with a good writing, direction and casting team. Would be prefect for would be writers and directors to watch and learn what *NOT* to do in films if you want to succeed.",1135641600,4,2155,4.550387596899225

Set in the year 3000, Travolta and Forrest Whitaker are the oversized overlords of a ravaged Earth, and Barry Pepper is the one man who can unite the humans and lead a revolt.

Which is what this movie does... revolts.  From Pepper's stealing of Mel Gibson's ""Braveheart"" hair extensions to Travolta's dreds, noseplugs and raver boots ensemble there's not a moment in this movie that convinces you it's anything other than a really bad movie.  Whitaker manages to look thoroughly embarrassed by his part here as a Psychlo with a conscience, while Travolta rolls his eyes and relishes his part as the corrupt Terl, a signal that he's too far gone to expect redemption at this point.

The sad thing is, after triumphing in ""Pulp Fiction,"" Travolta committed what amounted to career suicide by championing this flick, which seems to have been his lifelong dream of a project.

1276181,1,B00003CXIU,"OK, I understand that people believe, what they want to believe, but to what degree?  Apparently, John Travolta is really a huge follower of Scientology, since he was so eager to participate in this vile adaptation of a vile story, by L. Ron Hubbard.  But enough of that...  I could list so many problems with this movie, that I'd run out of space, but here are a few:

1.  Direction:  Who in their right mind would direct almost an entire film at a 45-degree angle?  I am sure, Roger Christian saw a few films that utilized this technique, but obviously, he didn't really understand its use.  In turn, I would say, good 90% of BE is shot at this angle.  It has no meaning, and only induces a massive headache, since we constantly have to tilt our heads one way or the other.

2.  Acting:  Even though, actors follow the director's instructions, they, themselves, should understand what their roles are.  I like Travolta, but I don't think he had the slightest clue about what he was in for.  There's no life in these performances, no intensity, no joy.  As for the dialogue, oh boy...  I must have heard word LEVERAGE a hundred times, here, and never did it make any sense or served any purpose.  This script was dead, before it was even written.  Unbelievable!

3.  Special Effects:  Did they exist in this train wreck?  I haven't seen anything special in these special effects.  Spaceships look cheesy, as do explosions, as does everything else.  Models and alien designs were a work of Patrick Tatopolous - the man behind ID4.  I have a huge problem with his designs - everything looks bulky, ugly, and useless.  Instead of creating something that at least looks somewhat otherworldly, we see huge rubber heads that wobble around.  Like I mentioned before, nothing special in these special effects.

So, all in all, this is absolutely, one of the worst things, ever put on film.  This ""thing"" should be a point/punchline of many jokes for years to come.  It is a stupid, ugly, and pointless exercise in badness.  I just hope that Roger Christian either:  Learns from this mistake or is banned from making movies, forever.",1128643200,11,2125,4.67479674796748

The movie gets two generous stars from me simply because, on a cheesy popcorn level, I thought it delivered. But ""Battlefield Earth"" is nowhere near a top-shelf film, nor should it ever be considered as such. I consider myself somewhat more forgiving than the average viewer mostly because, having read the entire novel, I possess a prior understanding of the vast plethora of material that was shamefully omitted from Corey Mandell's menial screenplay.

Put another way, this whole production was inspired by a 1,050 page novel. By shrinking down such a gargantuan story to accomodate the parameters of a meager two hour motion picture time-slot, you're sacrificing monumental chunks of vital subplot and fleshed-out character development that would have improved the finished product by unfathomable leaps and bounds.  This exact same tragedy nearly befell Peter Jackson with ""The Lord of the Rings,"" before New Line Cinema wisely allowed him to seperately adapt all three of those books in the manner they were intended. Patrick Tatopolous certainly deserves some measure of credit for his exemplary production design. But what happened with those Psychlos, and who ever decided they should look like overgrown jacked-up Klingons?

I think this ultimately should have been granted the multi-part miniseries treatment, with a totally different cast and a respectable screenplay that didn't so recklessly dumb down Hubbard's work.

It's the year three thousand and human is on the verge of extinction, a powerful but egotistic alien race, called the Psychlo, conquered the Earth in just a 9 minute fight. Since then the Psychlos have been raping the earth, miming all of the gold they can get their greedy claws on. They sound just like us!

He educates Jonnie with advanced math and sciences, since all humans at this point have literally become cave men, so he and a small group can mine a hidden gold cache.

The biggest problem with this move is the editing, there are all most no transition between scenes, because of this the story telling is very uneven and jumpy, you see Jonnie, running, jonnie screaming, getting knocked around, then running some more.

Travolta clearly let his deluded quasi-religious sentiments overwhelm any good sense he had when he decided to hatch this turkey.  I'm amazed he didn't invite all his Scientologist chums to take part in this homage to Hubbard, but then Tom Cruise still has a movie career to think about, so he probably would have demurred.

If you thought Pulp Fiction featured the ultimate ""Travolta in a coiffure from hell"", think again.  Then there's the outfits... I can imagine the conversation between Johnny and his special-effects guy -

""The Psychlos are really, really tall.  Like twelve feet.""

""Sorry, the whos???""

""Psychlos.""

""Psychlos?""

""Yeah.""

""Ooookay... *cough*  well, we could do some CGI special effects for that.""

""How much will that cost?""

""Ooooh - a few million.""

""Ah.  Youch.  Thing is, thanks to this film, and being in such a high maintenence religion, I'm a bit strapped...""

""Okay, we'll just use platform boots, then.""

1276330,5,B00003CXIU,"While Battlefield Earth is not totally faithful to the book, it does compare in quality to the excellent TV miniseries adaptation of Stephen King's ""It"".  The actors were specifically chosen for their uncanny resemblance to each character in the book.  Barry Pepper's stirring performance as Jonnie Goodboy Tyler is a story of an uneducated man who overcomes all obstacles placed before him.  Tyler is an excellent role model for children constantly bombarded with insipid movies of less talented action heroes.  Jonnie is the only person in his primitive village who notices there is something wrong with the land.  On his search for an answer, he is captured by the conniving Psychlo Security Chief Terl, played by John Travolta.  The movie pays homage to ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes"" when Jonnie and his two road friends are captured in an underground mall. Forest Whitaker's portrayal of Terl's dimwitted second in command is so convincing and believable, that it may be the greatest performance of his career. The only complaint I have is that Psychlos drink their Kerbango from saucers, not designer glasses.",1093305600,12,1118,5.115384615384615
1276331,1,B00003CXIU,"In this stunning adaptation of the novel of the same title, John Travolta is able to bring to the screen the passion that he feels for the teachings of the late L. Ron Hubbard. This is perhaps the finest performance of the venerable actor's career (without a doubt his best since ""Look Who's Talking Too""), and it is indeed an honor to Hubbard's legacy.

But there is much more to this film than Travolta's astonishing performance as the evil alien Terl. The supporting cast members are all excellent as well, and their acting is only enhanced by the terrific costumes that they wear, particularly those of the appropriately named Psychlos (although the rags of the cavemen are very good, too). Barry Pepper is also great as Jonnie Goodboy Tyler, the revolutionary human who leads the just assault on alien rule, and Forest Whitaker does a fine job as Ker, Terl's abused sidekick.

I will not spoil this film by giving away too many details, except to write that the plot is is clever and clear. And the premise -- that human civilization will one day crumble, leaving mankind dwelling in caves again -- is thoroughly original. That the cause of humanity's descent is enslavement by aliens is a well-conceived but chilling twist. Even the dialogue is witty and intelligent -- from Terl's harsh but eloquent criticisms of Ker to the grunts of Jonnie's fellow men.

However, the strongest point of ""Battlefield Earth"" is the extent to which the film truly reveals the literacy of director Roger Christian and screenplay writers Corey Mandell and J.D. Christianson. To understand just how well-read they are, I recommend the DVD's superb commentary by Christian and production designer Patrick Tatopoulos, since the discussion of various scenes demonstrates the filmmakers' astoundingly deep historical and cultural awareness. In one such scene, the theft of the Earth by the aliens is described as an allegory of how the U.S. stole its land from the Native Americans. Also, the scene in which Jonnie discovers books is outstanding, since his reading of the Declaration of Independence leads to the humans' revolt against the aliens. Though this particular allusion is not discussed in the commentary, that scene is clearly a metaphor for how Americans' ""rediscovery"" of the Declaration through the rhetoric of Abraham Lincoln coincided with the freeing of the slaves. Absolutely brilliant!

1276443,2,B00003CXIU,"Few films in modern history have undergone a drubbing resembling the one endured by John Travolta's ""Battlefield Earth."" The star of ""Saturday Night Fever,"" ""Grease,"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" doubtless wished he never made a comeback when he read the reviews for this film. ""Battlefield Earth"" the movie, as everyone probably knows, was based on a novel by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard. Since Travolta swears fealty to Hubbard's movement and is one of its most well known members, he wanted to bring the author's vision to the big screen. There's nothing wrong with that. But in an effort to lionize the leader of a controversial creed, Travolta stumbled big time. After viewing the film, I agree with the abuse critics heaped on this picture, but only to a certain extent. ""Battlefield Earth"" is an atrocity, a mind blasting heap o' badness best left rotting in a bargain bin at the local video store. I am not willing, however, to categorize this picture as one of the worst films in cinematic history. Fans of B movies will agree with me on this point. There are PLENTY of films out there far worse than this one.
In the year 3000, the planet earth is no longer a safe home for human beings. Some thousand years earlier, a race of hostile aliens from the planet Psychlo invaded our world and destroyed our civilization in a matter of minutes. For the next millennia, these rapacious invaders have systematically reduced the surviving humans to a state of stone age existence. In fact, the human race is dying out due to the continuing harassment of the Psychlos, who have built a base on the planet in order to mine the most precious resource known to the aliens: gold. When not hunting down humans for sport, the Psychlos plot against each other to better their position in their social hierarchy. Earth as we know it today is long gone, but there is one man who may yet rise against Psychlo tyranny and restore humanity to its rightful place on earth. This man is none other than Jonnie Goodboy Tyler (Barry Pepper), a mouthy upstart who frequently violates village rules about wandering into dangerous Psychlo territory. Predictably, Jonnie soon roams too far from the safety of his community and finds himself captured by these aliens.
The leader of the Psychlos on earth, and the creature who will soon face down Jonnie and his rapidly growing band of resistance fighters, is Terl (John Travolta). Terl is a conniving thug, always shouting and threatening his underlings--especially his assistant Ker (Forest Whitaker)--whenever he isn't brown nosing the brass during their infrequent visits to the planet. As for humans, the Psychlos never take them seriously. They treat them like animals, brutalize them, and keep them locked up in huge cages. Terl chuckles over these pitiful brutes, never realizing for a second that these ""animals"" are capable of complex emotions and rational thought. At some point in the film, Terl decides Jonnie possesses an ability to learn and allows the little man to plug into a machine that teaches a potential enemy everything about languages, mathematics, geometry, and weaponry. In a series of illogical leaps that stagger the imagination, Jonnie and his fellow barbarians manage to wage a successful war against Terl and the Psychlo invaders. Heck, these guys, who just minutes before could barely figure out how to sharpen a stick, successfully plan, organize, and launch a massive assault against alien hegemony. The wonder of it all!
The first part of the film had me wondering what all of the fuss was about. There were a few obvious problems to contend with, such as the chase scene in a thousand year old mall where Jonnie crashes through several panes of glass without cutting himself to ribbons (let alone the unbelievability that these glass panes could survive for a millennia with nary a crack), but these problems were little different from thousands of other movies. A few parts of the picture, particularly the very cool special effects used to create the information transmission pod that Jonnie uses to learn about the Psychlos, looked great. Even the battle sequences in the grand finale were far above average as far as science fiction movies go. So what is the problem with ""Battlefield Earth,"" the problem that turns the stomachs of the most jaded film critics? It's simple, really. Travolta's vanity flick is dumb, even dumber than most big budget films these days.
The biggest problem is the script. There are so many plot holes in ""Battlefield Earth"" that even I could have done a better job. The worst stupidities occur towards the end of the film when Jonnie recruits primitive humans in order to wage war against the invaders. Tyler and his allies breeze around the former United States like they owned the place, openly planning for war against their enemies. Totally unbelievable are the scenes where Jonnie finds thousand year old military depots loaded to the brim with pristine jet fighters, tanks, bombs, firearms, and nuclear weapons. When looking for a specific page in a manual about arming a nuclear weapon, one of the illiterate human beings bumps an overhead projector, the machine comes on, and there is the one page necessary to use the nukes. Impressive coincidence or major plot disaster? You be the judge. When I saw tribal members using flight simulators so they could learn to fly jets, I wrote the whole movie off as a lost cause. These examples are only a few of the serious problems that plague the picture; I won't even mention the annoying cinematography, the ridiculous appearance of the Psychlos, or the endless sci-fi clichs that appear regularly. Only lovers of disaster films and B movie nightmares should waste time viewing this crud.",1074816000,7,5734,4.930713547052741
1276444,1,B00003CXIU,"This film should get zero stars, but for some reason Amazon apparently isn't that cruel so you have to at least give it one star.
After decades of being celebrated as the worst filmmaker ever, and having ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" occupy that lofty position of worst film ever, and his film may be in danger of forever losing that status. I actually paid to see this film when it was in theaters, even though I was well aware of how it was being slammed as the worst film of the year at the time. And, boy, it easily was the worst film of that year and maybe any other.
Unlike Ed Wood's films, which at least always had this weird energy about them, this movie is just bad in every possible way.

If that happens I have a feeling John will be ponying up all the money out of his own pocket. And let's talk about Travolta. Has he ever done a worse acting job? Was he just on a mission to once again tank his career so that he could get around to making a decent film and claim another career revival?

It is, and the experience of watching it left me so dumbfounded that I have been unable to write a review for almost three years.  I've finally broken free of the Battlefield Earth spell and here's my take on the movie...
How horrible is this film?  To date there are 372 Amazon reviews and 176 are of the 1 star variety.  Just 65 gritted their teeth and gave it 5 stars, and that tells me that either there aren't many Scientologists or that even they couldn't line up behind this trainwreck of celluloid.
But the fact that this movie is so wretched is only half the story...every studio cranks out a stinker once in a while, but the budget of this disaster is what makes this such a truly god-awful experience.
Here are some other classic lousy films whose combined budgets don't equal that of Battlefield Earth:
Freddy Got Fingered
Dumb and Dumberer
House of 1000 Corpses
Corky Romano
Dude, Where's My Car?
From Justin to Kelly
The Real Cancun.
Yep, those flops together cost less to make than Battlefield Earth.
I can't totally condemn the film though.  No, this is something everyone with a sense of humor should watch.  The over-the-top performance of John Travolta, the massive plot holes, poor editing, ridiculous story, and absolutely horrendous dialogue have become legendary in the world of bad cinema.

1276501,1,B00003CXIU,"Based on a portion of the L. Ron Hubbard sci-fi pulp bestseller, BATTLEFIELD EARTH presents the story of earth some one thousand years after it has been colonized by invaders from outer space, who seek to rob the earth of its precious metals.  The human race has been almost eliminated: most have been exterminated, a few have been kept for slave labor, and a handful survive in pockets of tribal communities.  When one member of a tribal society (Barry Pepper) is captured for slave labor, a combination of circumstance and personal heroism provide him with the opportunity to lead a revolt.
All that sounds very well, but there are three things wrong with the movie: John Travolta, the script, and everything else.  Travolta's work has always been up and down, sometimes great and sometimes truly dire, but his appearance here as the evil invader Terl is easily the single worst performance he has given in his entire career.  No matter how you look at the thing, Travolta is as much like a bad guy from outer space as banana pudding--and really, I do believe that any self-respecting dish of banana pudding could have done a better job.
As for the script, it's really one of the strangest things I've ever heard.  In scenes with the aliens (called Psychlos), the dialogue actually sounds rather like a bad parody of a Noel Coward drawing-room farce.  The dialogue for the humans is equally absurd, playing out like a cross between BRAVEHEART and the more uninspired pages of a Barbara Cartland novel.  And while I'm willing to suspend disbelief to a certain extent, the plot has zero plausibility--even to the point of insulting viewer intelligence.
As for everything else, to give the film its due there are occasional design ideas and shots that seem interesting--but they are buried under a ton of very bad ideas that have been very badly executed.  The costume and make-up designs for the Psychlos look rather like bad drag at a leather bar for the fashion-challenged, the lovely braids of our hero and his tribe seem to have been lifted from Malibu Barbie, and all the big-scale special effects are very obviously miniatures.  Now, I wouldn't go so far as to say that I'd gouge my eyes out with a kitchen spoon before I'd sit through this debacle again, but I will say this much: someone would have to pay me, and even then I'd demand a remote control with a fast-forward feature.
As for the DVD package, the transfer is okay--but I did notice that the soundtrack was noticeably off for several minutes of the film, and oddly (and typically) I wasn't entirely sure if this was a flaw in the DVD or if the director/producers actually intended it to be that way!  There are also several short documentaries, all of them very repetitive and very ironically self-congratulatory about what a great film BATTLEFIELD EARTH is.  As for the audio commentary track, I really couldn't be bothered to sit through the movie a second time to listen to it.  My recommendation?  Well, if you're like me and you just have to see the film to find out if it's really as bad every one says it is... go ahead.  But for all others, just trust me on this one, okay?

Born again scientologist Pepper (after his education he starts spouting Hubbard's mantras like ""maths in the universal language"") doesn't really mine but merely picks up gold from fort Knox (after 1000 years of alien occupation they still haven't found the gold at Fort Knox?) of course psychlo Travolta not only believes that half a dozen man animals mined a few cubic meters of gold in 14 days but they also melted in down to perfect bars in their spare time? Given 7 more days to mine Pepper and fellow man-animals hatch a plan to liberate the planet using guns and planes (which are of course in perfect working order after 1000 years), man-animals learn to fly the jets (in 7 days flat using 1000 year old flight simulators which still have electricity). Of course the alien aircraft which took over the world in 9 minutes are no match for cavemen in jump-jets (but then again these cgi jump-jets are capable of hovering in hollow building and making hairpin turns!?). They then destroy planet psychlo by beaming up a nuclear bomb. Many scientology activists will plead with you to believe that the book isn't as bad as the movie, but my little bro read it and yes it contains all of the basic plot holes and stupidity of the film and them some.
The 'director' of this film (about now he's probably flipping burgers or cleaning toilets) tried to make the film stylish with countless jump cuts and other slick editing but that just deepens the cheesyness. Its pure hilarity too when they try to steal from other flicks: planet psychlo looks like the opening of 'Blade Runner' and also the running through glass scene from BR is repeated here too (Barry Bob Pepper however emerges from this feat without any lacerations!?), a speech reminiscent of 'BraveHeart' about ""freedom"" is given at one point by Pepper too (made even funnier by the fact that a man-animal in blue facepaint is in the background). And the idiotic screen wipes which are used! Obviously an attempt to emulate the good 'StarWars' movies (the original ones) they use doubledoor opening screens wipes in EVERY single scene transition! When the last scene cuts to the credits and they use a double door closing screen wipe, I was laughing so hard it hurt!
The fact that this is a big budget film means that you get to see a-list actors making fools of themselves on screen. Real life scientology cult member John Travolta, who you may remember from the period-costume drama 'Saturday Night Fever', puts in the single greatest comedy performance in film history! He reads ever single inept line of dialogue like it was pure Shakespeare in a dead serious manner that comes across as pure camp genius. Genuinely good actor Pepper is shamed too but not so much by his performance but by a script that had him making ape noises in a standoff! If only they had of cast true scientology fanatic and non-actor Tom Cruise in Pepper's role and spared Barry the embarrassment, I'm sure the film would have got even worse (if thats possible?).
While I only gave this film 1 star for pure comedy viewing this film definitely earns 5 stars! During the entire 2 hour running time you will be in a state of constant laughter, more so than can be generated by any comedy movie put out in the last 10 years. In fact there is something almost surreal about viewing 'Battlefield Earth' in that unlike any other so bad its good movies this one was made on an enormous Hollywood budget. While all big budget flicks made in Hollywood are bad by default, none come close to the virtuoso ludicrous insanity that is 'Battlefield Earth'!
While it is good for a hearty laugh and satisfying to see what should be a triumph for scientologists go down in history as one of the most absurd film blunders of all time (LOL not mention the substantial fanatical losses inflicted on all parties involved), I can't help feel bad that the money that went into production of this trainwreck of a film could have gone a long way in fighting cancer or world hunger or any other worthy cause.",1066953600,102,5425,4.711578947368421
1276503,1,B00003CXIU,"One of the most maligned films of the last decade, ""Battlefield Earth"" actually isn't QUITE the worst film ever made.  However, it proves once and for all that vanity projects are not a good idea (see my review for Star Trek: The Final Frontier).
What is wrong with this film has largely been covered both by other reviewers and the Amazon.com description.  However, it does deserve a brief summary.  The film is a disaster on almost every conceivable level.  The camera angles and whole filming method are bizarre, and there are gaps in logic that any five-year old could spot.  In fact, if I played a drinking game that said I took a shot for every plot hole I spotted, I would be passed out within the first 30 minutes.  The actors are all on different levels.  Forrest Whitaker huffs and puffs, but he can't inflate a leather balloon.  He at least seems to realize he's in a camp fest, but John Travolta and Barry Pepper as the two leads play their roles embarrasingly straight-faced.  The special effects are adequate at best, and the action is incredibly sloppy.  There actually is a good battle sequence at the end, but by that point the film is beyond the point of any redemption (hence the one-star rating).  In order to believe what is happening on the screen, you must forget any lessons in science or basic reasoning that you have been taught since fourth grade.
Luckily, ""Battlefield Earth"" was DOA at the box office (maybe Americans aren't quite as stupid as we sometimes seem) and was roasted by critics.  The two people that can be blamed for this film are director Roger Christian and John Travolta, and I demand punishment for them.  I think poor Christian has paid enough- his beloved sci-fi ""summer hit of 2000"" lost more money than many of us make in a lifetime, and he's been unable to find work ever since.  Plus, he was just a hired gun- this whole thing was Travolta's idea from the start, and he still doesn't get it.  As if to pour salt on an open wound, he continued to defend the film for months after its release, and even threatened to make a sequel- surprisingly, he didn't find a lot of people willing to fund it.
So yeah, I saw this movie once, and that was enough.  I would never buy it.  Wait a second- if there was a commentary from Travolta and it was nothing but him saying ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry..."" over and over again, then I would consider buying it.  Meanwhile, just rent it for a few unintentional laughs and let it forever languish as a financial loss to all those involved in it.",1065830400,7,2525,4.5
1276504,4,B00003CXIU,"I know that Battlefield Earth was supposed to be some grand sci-fi film about Scientology or some thing, but all it really is is a joke of a film. There isn't a single good thing about it. But, by being so remarkably terrible, its a real hoot to watch if you like bad movies. The aliens (one of wich is played by John Travolta) look like giant Klingon action figures, and the acting in this movie would be better suited for an actual parody film. There is also tons of bad effects (the cow being shot in the field by Travolta is the funniest thing I've ever seen) and inconsistancies (how the aliens guns fire and how they are held; the size of the aliens). Oddly enough, though, the story itself wasn't TOO bad. It wasn't confusing or any thing. Granted, the story wasn't very good, either, but it could fit any typical sci-fi flick.
So if you can enjoy a bad film, this is really the movie for you. But if you can't stomach seeing bad acting and lame costumes, stay as far away from Battlefield Earth as possible.",1065571200,,1015,4.347368421052631

I suspect that Hollywood's rather patronising view that a couple of loud bangs and a spaceship or two is all it takes to satisfy a Science fiction film fan had a lot to do with it. Wrong guys try coming up with a logical plot line and three dimensional characters.

1276558,2,B00003CXIU,"This movie is not all bad; it's bad, really bad, but there are a few redeeming moments in it, enough that I squeaked out a second star (barely).
It's supposedly the year 3000, and ""superior"" aliens have pretty much conquered the Earth and are now stripping our planet's mineral wealth.  As we find out during the movie, once the mineral wealth is gone, the evil aliens plan to exterminate the rest of mankind.  If you think about it, this movie sounds like ""Independence Day"", after the aliens win.  Except that ""Independence Day"", while over-the-top and unrealistic, is an Academy Award winner AND documentary-like compared to this turkey.
The Psychlos are the aliens that have conquered the Earth.  The only problem is that these aliens are so dumb that you wonder how they ever conquered potty-training.  Somehow these ""superior"" aliens have not realized that the man-animals once had a reasonably complex technologically-based society.  Thus, when the man-animals have the opportunity to steal a few weapons and take out some of their captors, the Psychlos seem so surprised.  Either the Psychlos have never run into a planet with any sort of technology, or their arrogance is greater than that of any human that has ever lived.
More evidence of alien stupidity:  Forest Whitaker doesn't realize his boss is setting Forest up by secretly recording a meeting between the two of them.  I guess the ""advanced"" aliens have never considered that someone might record them and use that recording for blackmail.  John Travolta's childish explanation of the devious way in which he recorded the meeting for blackmail purposes will make you wish for a cheesy detective movie, partially as a substitute for this movie and partially to hope the detective will come pummel some aliens, particularly Travolta.
Even more alien stupidity:  When John Travolta sets humans out to mine gold, they go get gold bars from Fort Knox instead.  Their explanation to Travolta:  We figured you wouldn't want it raw.  I was starting to think this movie was a comedy this portion was so hilarious.
More stupidity:  Given that the atmosphere of the alien planet reacts badly to nuclear weapons, you would think that step one in conquering a planet with nuclear weapons would be to safeguard your planet from those weapons.  Didn't I say something about arrogance earlier?
Much of the movie, which drags on and on, is devoted to explaining how the down-trodden humans were able to put themselves in a position to challenge their alien masters.  Of course we get to the end of the movie, if we are still awake, where the challenge between the aliens and humans occurs; we know what happens, the rest is just details.
At this point I'm reconsidering my two-star rating.  First, this movie was boring beyond belief.  Much of the movie is confusing.  After a while the only reason I watched the whole thing was to give the movie every opportunity to redeem itself.  The movie finally did get a bit interesting near the end, but by then I had moved onto my second point.  Second, the acting was bad.  The acting was very bad.  When the acting was not bad, it was hammy and corny.  The only person I can point to in this movie that did a halfway decent job of acting was Barry Pepper, who somehow managed to get through this movie retaining some measure of the esteem he gained from being in ""Private Ryan"".
You would think that the confused, boring story line and the bad acting would be enough to deep six this movie, and they are, but we can add to these two points plot holes large enough to fit the Titanic into, sideways; perhaps even TWO Titanics, sideways and end-to-end.
Didn't I say there were a couple of good points to this movie?  The best point is the special effects of the ruined Earth.  The special effects are phenomenal.  They don't make up for the rest of the movie, but they are good.  Also, Barry Pepper's acting managed to hang in there in spite of the disaster taking place around him.
This movie is such a turkey that a real turkey this size would feed Boston at Thanksgiving.  ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" move over, I think we have a new contender for the worst movie of all time.",1055376000,4,4172,4.730290456431535
1276559,1,B00003CXIU,"It's a shame that Amazon doesn't have like -1000 or something, because that's about what this movie deserves.
Anyways, I can't believe that Hollywood actually lets stuff like this out.  It should be buried on the moon in the vault they mention in 3001.  There are some bad movies that have merit because there is some entertainment value in this.  Sadly, this movie isn't one of them.
Where to start on this movie?  I've seen some cheesy plots before, but this one takes the cake.  It makes the Planet of the Apes bomb movie look like first rate cinema.  Talk about a disjointed plot.  Then there is the fantastic acting and dialogue.  I could swear at around the halfway point, Forest Whittaker stopped taking the movie seriously.  He was using every willpower bone in his body to not break out laughing.  The sad part is that John Travolta was taking this movie seriously.  Then there was the camerawork.  Why did every scene with the Rasta Klingons have the camera tilted?  I thought there was a problem with my TV or something.  And the costuming.  Was the costume guy rejected by Star Trek or something?  These guys looked like Rastafarian Klingons.
Sad part is that I kept plowing through this movie thinking it would get better at some point.

Though some of us may have difficulties with the idea of 1000 year old fighter planes that run without fuel or huge veins of gold that are just on the surface of the planet that we missed for some reason to be reasons to not see the film, I say watch it once, just use someone else's money.

Based on the novel written by L. Ron Hubbard, the creator of the famous Scientology church (The religion of the rich and famous). Apparently comedy and cheese was in the mind of MR Hubbard when he was writting this:
In the year 3000 the good old planet Earth is lay waste by a race of cheesy extraterrestrial called the Psychlos who have slaved the planet. Apparently 90% of the population of earth died laughing at their ridiculous visage: a sort of Cowardly Lion meets Chewbacca meets Bob Marley. A few of the non slave humans survive in the wild without any kind of technology, living as cavemen. One of them, Jonnie Goodboy Tyler (Barry Pepper, who looks more long haired Mattew Lillard as Shaggy than a movie hero) is taken prisoner.
(Spoilers, like you care)
In captivity he plans revolution, apparently just for the kick of it, and thanks of the sheer stupidity of the Psychlos (mainly to the comedic duo of John Travolta's Terl and Forest Whitaker's Ker, who put Martin & Lewis to shame!), the  script and a healthy diet of rats (don't ask) he gets away
with it. Then there is a final battle, primitives humans who knew nothing about technology learn how to fly combat jets in a few days in flight simulators with only repeating ""Piece of cake, piece of cake"" as a motto. Then is Psychlos v/s humans with lot of explosions and mediocre FX, guess who wins?
(End Spoilers)
According to John Travolta this is a movie he wanted to make for more than 20 years in honor of his dear mentor Mr. Hubbard. Looking at the results it seems that the wait was in vain.

The filmmakers and producers were aiming high with this movie, they were dreaming another ""Star Wars"" trilogy in the making with thousand of millions wasted in merchandising, action figures and promotion, several spin off were planned
before the premiere (including a sequel and even an animation series!) but after the box office and critical slaughter they wake up and realize they got ""Robot Monster"", ""Plan 9 of Outer Space"", ""Manos, The Hands of Fate"", ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"", ""Terror from the Year 5000"" and ""Mommie Dearest"" all rolled into one. That is the greatest Sci-fi comedy ever made!
The movie is full of plot holes of the size of Brazil, useless plot points, lack of pacing but full of precious moments of camp and hilarity for the whole family! Everything that made the cinema art great is wrong in this one: terrible script, inept direction, ugly photography and lighting, confusing edition, overblown sound and music, obtrusive camera angles, run of the mill special effects and the acting MY GOD! the acting is incredible bad. The entire cast is making fool of themselves but it seems they thought they were doing Shakespeare in space. Even under thousand of layers of bad make up you can still notice co-producer John Travolta hysterical overacting. He takes his character waaaay too seriously and read his lines channeling Vincent Vega by the way of Danny Suko with a bit of Tony Manero on crack. And you can still see Forest Whitaker face of complete embarrassment. But I really felt sorry for Barry Pepper who must have signed the dotted line thinking this part would be his big brake. And why is Richard Tyson doing the role of Tarzan in the future? Or is Deathstalker? Or Yor? But my favorite is Kim Coates in the role of Carlo, world's biggest wimp and useless sidekick who spent the entire movie cowering in fear, arm waving, over reacting, and eye popping in extreme his green eyes, you'll swear he is Marty Feldman in disguise.
See it to believe it. Buy the DVD or the VHS, fired up the popcorn, have a few drinks and laugh your head off. And then exorcise you tv set.

1276565,2,B00003CXIU,"I've seen my share of bad movies, and ""Battlefield: Earth"" isn't anything new. It is bad. There's no doubt about that. It isn't however, terrible. It suffered from many faults. Many, many faults. Many, many .... (if I keep it up I'll sound like a Pratchett troll counting, so I'll stop.)
Okay, first of all: Terl. This entire message in this paragraph is a message to John Travolta himself. I never had a clear voice of Terl in my head from the book, but he most certainly did not sound like Harry Potter (heck, Harry had a deeper voice in ""Chamber of Secrets)! Terl was too flamboyant; his character was supposed to be intelligent, but crafty. Crafty is NOT gesticulating wildly and ... GAH! It hurts! John-boy's Terl came off like some second rate Bond villain.
Rather than give myself an ulcer ranting about Terl, I'll move on. Ker was just as bad as Terl! I thought that Forest Witaker was a good choice to play Ker, but he's nothing like he was in the book! Ker was supposed to be a kindly Pyschlo, different and a midget! Not some halfwit trying to follow in Terl's footsteps, those foppish, British footsteps.
The Pyschlo's themselves looked all wrong. Dressed in KISS outfits and looked sufficiently enough like Klingons to have fooled at least a handful of Star Trek fans into seeing it, these are definitely not what Hubbard had in mind. They're supposed to be bony and hairy and not have fake rubber paws! They got their height about right, but the Pyschlo girth was missing. They really didn't look all that more intimidating than a basketball team (granted, the Globetrotters freak me out, but ...)!
Okay, Psychlo-bashing aside the plot was lacking and badly translated. Perhaps if it had been more faithful to the original story, it might have fared better. I'm not the biggest fan of the book, but I did find it enjoyable enough to seek out the movie and I now awake screaming from nightmares of an ""Ender's Game"" movie that was as bad as this (with Travolta as Graff! Nooo!). Jonnie was the only one captured, and captured by Terl since it was his plan from the start. (Incidentally, why were the Pyschlos caging humans in the movie if they couldn't us them for work? This film had more holes in it than a Michael Bay film!) Jonnie's people came off less like cavemen and more like Indians. And where was Robert the Fox? If he was in the movie, he neither looked like he should've nor was mentioned by name. Same with Brown Limper and Pattie.
Now what I LIKED about the movie.
Jonnie was well cast and well acted, although Pepper's effort here is like trying to add dab of chocolate to a vat of offal and calling it edible. Pepper seems to have the talent to go far in the movie industry and displays it in ""The 25th Hour"". Chrissie wasn't near as annoying as she seemed in the book. And Terl's fate was nicely ironic, I thought (in the last scene, not with the collar). Aside from that, the whole movie was an amalgam of movies I didn't care for (""Independence Day"" and ""Total Recall"" to name a few).
The movie is bad, but not unwatchable. I can think of several that were plenty worse and much more campy. ""Virus"" was a terrible, terrible adaptation of a great comic and Jet Li's ""The One"" ... THAT is probably the worst movie I've seen recently. ""Battlefield Earth"" is pretty bad, more of a ""MST3K"" movie than anything, but it's better than a tiny handful of movies. If you're looking for a good sci-fi film though, just stick with ""The Matrix"".",1046649600,3,3464,4.526315789473684
1276566,1,B00003CXIU,"I cannot even begin to explain just how despicable that Battlefield Earth really is. Even when I brush aside the negative talk about this movie by numerous critics and reviewers I still cannot deny how much that I agree with them. In fact, I agree wholeheartedly with them one hundred percent. This movie is just total garbage. I have no trouble wondering why I see tons and tons of movie merchandise that is cluttering up the flea markets and yard sale shops.
The performances by the cast are all completely ridiculous to a vomit inducting degree. The beloved John Travolta, who brought us Grease, unfortunately completely falls flat onto a large pile wet cement with the completely laughable role as the villain who hardly even looks like a true villain and the villain looks more like someone who hasn't shaved for the past 40 years and living in the sewers or a cave. Travolta is SOOOOOO much better than this. The whole laughter is more like a bad reject from a Men In Black throwaway scene without J and K than of a true science fiction movie. The names of the characters are predictable too. I could've come up with far better alien names in 30 seconds! Even some of the dumber characters from the Star Wars movies had far better charisma and intelligence. Bloody Hell, the loathed Jar Jar Binks that a lot of movie-goers hate is a thousand times better than any character from Battlefield Earth. I think that Jar Jar is alright in my opinion but let's not change the subject of this review. Everyone else on this movies cast fare no better and all of them show signs of wanting to immediately leave the set when the day was done and their characters combined show as much emotion and intelligence as a dead cockroach!
 The whole storylines is just downright idiotic. The plot is unbelievably stupid. What gives the OK to simply alter the laws of chemistry in the 31st Century, such as a fire burning in an environment that has no oxygen? Even the lines don't fare well at all.
It all starts with some alien force from some planet names Psygor who hate the Earth's humanity but are after its gold and they look more like a whole bunch of mutilated humans who are walking on stilts and they don't even show any intelligence nor the fright factor of an enemy alien race, nor even the rivalry expressions of rival human beings on Earth. The name of the alien's planet Psygor is just downright laughable. It almost sounds more like they are calling their planet ""Psycho""! The aliens themselves get drunk on some sort of yellow fluid like humans do with alcoholic beverages! How ridiculous not to mention disgusting. Even the human alliance is dumb and trite. They go to a derelict library, and then an abandoned army airbase with planes that are loaded with 1000 year old fuel and learn and become pilots and explosive experts.....IN SEVEN DAYS?????!!!!!!! HELLO!!!!!!!! It takes years of training to learn how to fly a plane, and even more training to be even an amateur explosives expert!! What were they thinking when they made this terrible movie. And they blow up the alien planet in that short amount of time? Don't ask........... It all simply goes downhill after the first few minutes after the opening and ultimately plummets into a whole bunch of useless and monotonous clichs, stupid lines, horrible acting, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah...........
Even the space scenarios and special effects weren't enough to rescue Battlefield Earth from being left to rot in the junk pile!  A complete and utter waste of film and talent! This movie is complete and total [junk] that should never have even been put into existence!. All of the actors and actresses as well as everyone else involved in the making of this...should be deeply ashamed of themselves and this is a huge and ignominious and absolutely crushing blow to modern day sci-fi.",1046563200,5,3858,4.714074074074074
1276627,1,B00003CXIU,"Plot: And I use the word loosely here. Earth has been conquered by an alien race of supermorons called the Psychlos, who have enslaved most of humanity. Among the few who live freely is Johnny ""Goodboy"" Tyler. After being captured by the Psychlos, our hero gets knowledge shot into his brain through his eyeballs (I kid you not) by the enemy. ...
Opinion: Wow, we are talking about Plan Nine from Outer Space type of material here. I watched with a friend for a laugh and, man, did we ever laugh. I wonder what the script writer was thinking! He uses the words rat-brain and leverage so often that I wonder if these were words that he would throw in whenever he didn't know what to write next (which is, apparently, fairly often). Just the lead character's name is stupid (Johnny ""Goodboy"" Tyler). The psychlos (gee, I wonder from what word the author derived the name) are so profoundly idiotic that I wonder how they ever managed to have a space program. Maybe their ship had a slow leak that caused air rarefication, causing severe brain damage?
The acting is all-around mediocre, especially when Travolta tries to ham it up. And the plot is so full of holes that I wonder if it was written on swiss cheese (which would explain the cheesy factor, which is off the charts). For example, how come there is still electricity to supply the flight simulators used to train the ""cavemen"" to fly Harrier jets. By the way, I am somewhat awed by Euclid: apparently he was known even to an alien race. The only suspenseful moment in the film is the finale, which lets us suppose that a sequel is on the way (yeah right).

That Aside this movie takes on a similar genre to the Original ""Planet of the Apes"" film with the premise that humans are lowered to a primitive status to only be used as slaves for a superior species. I personally enjoyed this film mainly because of the way it portrayed Aliens who oppressed human society during  a post apocolyptic world where human history and knowledge have been erased in order to control the humans as slaves.
The special effects weren't that bad either, although 8' tall hairy aliens did look cheezy at times. Nevertheless the plot was good and the concept behind these 8' tall aliens disprespecting our knowledge to the extent that they would enslave us to only do manual labor makes you question how our species would be treated if there was a real alien takeover of earth. In my opinion you have to have an open mind when watching a movie like this by looking at the philosophies involved in the context of this movies storyline.

1276632,2,B00003CXIU,"Battlefield Earth is one of those movies up there with Water world, Eight Legged Freaks and the other Big Budget Bombs. It is really obvious they spent a lot of money making this movie, excluding the script, of course. The special effects, cemitogrophy and scenery are fairly good, and that is about it.
This movie is a big plate of fat under a nice sauce in a restaurant that charges too much. It looks nice, but there is nothing to it. It will taste good when you try it, but it will make you sick by the time you finish it and will make you more sick when you get the bill.
The break down goes this way: evil aliens run around the galaxy conquering other aliens, making them their slaves while harvesting the resources of the conquered planet. The poor victims of alien exploitation are exterminated with the usual sad story.
It's a rather neat, although worn out sci-fi story. Here is the part that really makes this story more worn, the book that the movie is based on is from the founder and former leader of the cult of Scientology. Whos ""religion"" is based on something of the same story. Makes you think, huh?
The main evil alien is played by everyone's favorite Scientologists, John Tovolta and his ever inspiring evil squirming sidekick is played by Forest Whitaker. The ever do good human good guy is played by Berry Pepper and his band of merry slightly evolved cavemen ""we'll follow Mr. Good guy main character"" are played by a bunch guys who I have never heard and most likely never will.
What makes this film ever so much garbage is numerous and unbelievable plot holes, most of which can be ignored except for the ever predictable final epic battle. For example, we are lead to believe that a bunch of cavemen can learn to fly Harrier Jump Jets in 9 days with enough skill that they can not only take-off and fly but also shoot down the bad guys aircraft. Throw into the mix that the hardware has been sitting around for a thousand years, and well, you get a very unbelievable ending. Of course the good guys win and the bad guys lose and pay the highest of prices for their enslavement of mankind, the destruction of their home world with a nuclear weapon that also has been sitting around for a thousand years.
Battlefield Earth is just one of those film you have to see once so you can shake your head asking how they got the whole thing through production without a single high ranking person the production or movie company saying, ""Hey, this movie if horrible. We should not make anymore of it!"" Its very existence will boggle your mind and now that is a scary sci-fi plot!",1042416000,6,2596,4.4789029535864975

In the very beginning (after a few yawn-filled introductions to the romantic pulse of the movie that quite simply didn't have to be) this mixed moments began with something that seemed like it might be somewhat promising, with cities that exist as charred husks beneath a sky that is endowed with the primitive aspects of a religion that see our lovely statues as Gods and explain away malls and the plastic people within them (not consumers, mind you, but the mannequins they leave behind) and cursed by these mythic figures. This seems furthered by something that comes stalking our three tourguides to the primitive thoughts that are born when society reverts, using some sort of energy weapon to destroy the inanimate and to stun these beasts with a pulse. After this, however, the real fun and the lack of forethought begins.
When we are introduced to the badly named aliens that have overrun the human face and the society that they further, the flaws start to manifest themselves and keep running deeper and deeper into the confines of the story. We see their thoughts on how humans should be used as slaves to collect material from areas where these beasts simply cannot breath, how the hierarchy of the pens that the hominids are kept in works, and that there is a spark of hope existing in the depths of a human soul that doesn't play his part all that well. He constantly rebels and tries to flee and his keepers and, finding him to be too much woe in the making, they decide to play a little game of ""how long will it take the beast to suffocate."" This would have ended the problem therein, too, except the head of security (played by J. Travolta) for this overglorified miners and his subsequent greed decide to take centerstage. This, in turn, leads a viewer down more of the darkspots of a plot that lets a technologically-impared peoples learn to fly in weeks, gives us a few laughs when cows are used as target practice and when it is decided that raw rat must to man-animal's favorite food, and made me turn it off when the final battle for freedom and the paper-thin plot of the human resistance began.
If you haven't watched this movie and decide to do so, good for you. It is my belief that tormenting one's mind with moving images that will haunt you for a lifetime can't be a bad thing; a philosophy I developed shortly after watching this work of supposed art.

The aliens defeat all the nations on Earth in nine minutes.  Humanity is enslaved, save for small bands of people living in key areas of the land (you'll find out why, and this only strengthens the resolve of our heroes).
Flash forward 1,000 years and humanity is a dying species which is allowed to live solely for labor.  What follows is the story of resistence and liberation from the oppressing entities which seem to exist solely to dominate and brutalize man via actions and views of race/spirituality/materalism.

There's a reason this movie won so many 'Raspberry awards'....Worst leading actor, worst leading actress, worst couple in a movie(John Travolta and anyone on the screen with him at the time)lol! Worst director and others....I think it won nine raspberry awards in all!
The movie had some potential, I was dissapointed more wasn't done with it.  I groaned as cave men people decide to take ancient fighter jets and fly them, never even having seen one before.  The fact that the airplanes hadn't been flown in over a thousand years and *still worked* was just a minor detail they overlooked(yeah, right).  Just try leaving a well running new car sitting in your driveway for six months or a year and see what happens.  And where did the electricity come from??  If people have reverted to the stone age, and all the old cities are in ruins, how were they able to simply turn on the lights when they find an old military instilation??
Good points....um, the lead guy had a nice looking horse.  But, that's yet another bad point, I cannot imagine that goregeous Lustino stallions are running around for the picking in the american southwest regions over a thousand years after everything falls apart.  Mustangs took only a hundred years or less to turn into short, rough, and not very attractive forms.  We're suposed to belive that a horse who looks like he'd win a modern conformation competition will easily be around?
Also, the ammount of time things have suposedly been different....the ammount of ruin of the buildings they found looked more like fifty or a hundred years tops worth of weathering and ruin.

In the hands of a moderately competant scriptwriter and director, Battlefield Earth could have been made into a pretty good film.  The story even had the potential of being a blockbuster SciFi flick.  Unfortunately, we got stuck with this piece of stinking garbage.  Travolta in his silly stilt costume is actually one of the more forgiveable aspects of this wreched film.  If you have read the book, then you have to wonder why they made the changes that they did.  Harrier jets working after 1000 years?  Casts of hundreds that go ""urh! urh! urh!""?  What is this about?  These changes do nothing to make the movie better or understandable to people who aren't scientologists.  They do nothing to make the book's plot tighter for cinema.  In fact, they degrade the story and make the screenwriter look like a hack that was hired because someone lost a bet.

Not easy at all, when you're on your own, and unarmed, but this is a Hollywood movie after all, so why not?...

You know a lot of things in the movie can't really happen, but you can let yourself believe you can for those two hours you're immersed in another world. Unless, of course, the movie is too ludicrous and everything that happens screams disbelief. Battlefield Earth has enough unbelievable situations for three terrible movies. (Warning, minor spoilers ahead).
The premise of the film asks you to accept that a supreme alien race conquered Earth in 9 minutes, and then for 1,000 years have reaped the land for natural resources, namely gold. So a civilization so advanced it can take control of a planet so quickly, hasn't found all the gold on Earth yet? And hasn't even found Fort Knox yet? And they don't have a clue that humans are intelligent enough to operate mining equipment (They laugh at the thought of humans being able to do any work), yet they live in the ruins of Denver, surrounded by obvious signs of an intelligent race which they enslaved. At one point in the film, even, these humans, who have been forced to live in caves or cages, find an army base filled with still working planes and weapons, and learn how to operate everything as good as any experienced pilot or soldier, in only a few days. I could go on; these are just the tip of the iceberg.
Besides the ridiculous leaps of belief the movie asks you to make, there is more to despise here. For example, the pacing is atrocious. In the first 5 minutes of the movie, you meet Jonnie (Barry Pepper) as he returns to his home tribe, says a few words to the woman we're told he's romantically involved with, gets in a fight with the head of the tribe about how they should venture out of their caves, and leaves. The film doesn't show us how they live, explore their culture, examine the relationship Jonnie has neither with the head of the tribe nor with his girlfriend, or even give Jonnie any in depth characterization.  Instead, the whole movie moves so fast, we don't know these characters any better then the extras without any speaking lines.
However, there are a few things to admire in this film. Primarily, there are some beautiful scenery shots of mountains, fields, and cities overgrown and taken back by the wilds. There are even a few good ideas peppered throughout the film. Just don't blink, you might miss them.
If you're not at all fussy about intelligent (or even somewhat believable) science fiction, or character development, or even acting (a can of worms I didn't open, John Travolta is terrible as the bad alien Terl), then Battlefield Earth might be worth a quick glance.

1276781,1,B00003CXIU,"John Travolta has done some bad movies in his career (Michael, Perfect, Phenomenon, Mad City, Two of a Kind). It's too bad because Travolta's a good actor, and has had his share of good movies too (Saturday Night Fever, Pulp Fiction, Grease, Face/Off). But Battlefield Earth is as awful as movies come.
  He plays Terl, an alien from the planet Psychlo. He looks like hell. They have given him ugly claw-like hands, billowy eyebrows, and a massive bush of dreadlock hair. The make up designer has copied the aliens from Star Trek and Star Wars so he looks like a cross between a Klingon and a Cantina alien.
  This has also got to be the worst performance of Travolta's career. He tries to make Terl a diabolic, yet sarcastic villain and it just doesn't work. Given, he's working with a horrible script, and doesn't have much support from other cast members, but I expected more of a Darth Vader-like bad guy. Terl is not menacing at all, and quickly turns into a joke rather than a true villain. His appearance on screen is an annoyance as he hams it up, sniffing and cackling somewhat like Jack Nicholson's Joker.
  Ludicrous is the only word to explain the rest of the film. The script is based on a 1982 novel by the founder of Scientology, L. Ron Hubbard. Travolta is a known follower of Scientology, and maybe that explains why he did the film. It is badly photographed, with set design that is drab and chintzy, looking a lot like Blade Runner (though not nearly as good).  It's the most dismal, depressing art direction and cinematography I've ever seen.
  It takes place in the year 3000, when mankind is near extinction and many Psychlos have colonized Earth. Terl is Earth's chief of security, patrolling our destroyed cities with his troops and watching over the few humans (man animals!) that are left. Barry Pepper plays Jonnie, who tries to form an uprising and save Earth from Terl and his men. Pepper, who was excellent in Saving Private Ryan and The Green Mile, has very little opportunity to make the role of Jonnie a good one. He does his best, but the character is too dense and shallow.
  Dark, uninspiring, and just plain rotten, Battlefield Earth left me feeling sorry for Travolta and Pepper who have more potential. A note to John Travolta: Fire your agent and get more films like Pulp Fiction and Get Shorty. If you make the right choices maybe we'll see you with the gold on Oscar night someday. Let's just hope it's not the year 3000. Rated PG-13 for violence and light profanity. (No stars) (F)

Since then every studio has stolen ideas from this fine piece of literature, and what we have here is a film that looks as if it was ripped off of every science-fiction film produced when it should be the other way around.  In fact, ""Battlefield Earth"" was originally suppose to be made into an blockbuster film upon the release of the novel but somehow it never developed until John Travolta funded the project on his own.
What you did have was a wonderful story about how a society that was lost and tried to find itself by learning from it's amazing past.  The novel read for thousands of pages.  It was very deep and covered many aspects of the characters, and made for a legendary story.

The book is good, the movie is not.  If I hadn't read the book, I'd have had NO idea what the backstory or main thrust of this movie was.  But after seeing this movie I went out and purchased another copy of the book and read it again, and I enjoyed it even more.
This movie is more pedestrian than terrible.  ""Independence Day"" was worse than this movie.  God, I HATED that movie!  'Nuff said.
The only truly bad thing about the movie ""Battleship Earth"" is that John Travolta was miscast as the lead villain Terl.  Terl was written as a greedy company man, a small cog in a larger ""alien"" organization.  Travolta plays him all wrong and just comes off looking silly.  The focus of the book was on the hero, Johnny Goodboy Tyler.  Travolta wanted to make his character the centerpiece of the film, and the story suffered as a result.
In short:  ""Battlefied Earth"" the book is great source material for what could have been a good mini-series.  But on the big screen as Travolta's pet Scientology project, it just doesn't work.",1025827200,,1642,4.606896551724138

I've seen a lot of horrible movies, but never before had I seen a movie so horrible as Battlefield Earth.
The quality of the plot is amazingly bad.  Aliens (from a planet called Psychlo) want to steal gold- that's pure genius.  The acting is also amazing.  John Travolta's screen presence as a 7 foot Rastafarian alien bad [guy]with nose plugs is perfect for a film of this calibur.  It's good to know that dreadlocks are a universal style.  I'm hoping to find afros on other planets also.
This movie also gave me neck cramp from having to compensate for all the tilted camera angles in the film.  This is the first movie (and hopefully not the last) to give me a personal injury.  Bravo.  I guess the director wanted to get a little ""artistic"".

1276926,2,B00003CXIU,"BATTLEFIELD EARTH isn't one of the worst movies of all time. Nor is it that good of a movie either. What makes the movie seem worse than it really is, is the film's high production cost and great actors stuck in a movie that's really nothing more than glorified camp. A lot of the special effects would seem spectacular in a more unified picture. However, here they become objects to laugh and they lower the image of the film.

The cast in BATTLEFIELD EARTH has a tremendous depth of talent and skill. However, the plot of the movie is so convoluted, that all their talent is wasted. Nevertheless, sometimes even with a terrible script filled with plot holes and nonsense, a decent film can be made if all the actors are on the same track. Unfortunately, none of the actors seemed to know what to make of this movie. For most of the film, John Travolta appears to act like he knows this film is going to be pure camp. Yet, there are times when his performance takes a ""serious"" turn. That combined with the fact that this was his little pet project (one that he helped produce) makes one wonder if he actually realized how campy this film was going to be.

There are no doubts what Barry Pepper and Forest Whitaker were up to. Pepper pulls off quite a believable performance as Jonnie, the human who saves the Earth. Pepper seemed to think his role (and the movie) should be taken seriously. After all, even the films with the worst dialogue and plot can be improved with good acting. On the other hand, Whitaker acts as though he knew the film was pure camp and seemed to have a lot of fun making the movie.

Therein lies the problem with the film: the movie can't decide if it wanted to be taken at least somewhat seriously or if it wanted to become a campy classic. Such a shame.",1013817600,,1783,4.3969696969696965

Let me say before I begin bashing that I have absolutely nothing against scientology.  If rich Hollywood types want to throw money at a religion that requires no discipline in daily life, then fine.  Why do I mention Scientology?  The mastermind behind the source material for this dribble is none other than L. Ron Hubbard, or ""Mr. Money Vacuum.""  Supposedly, this film is supposed to be littered with Scientological dogma, although I was too busy laughing my rear off to catch any of it.  This film is not a comedy, in case you're skimming.
The basic plot of this film is that the Earth was taken over in a few minutes by some aliens, and the human race is reverted back to a bunch of Cro-Magnon slugs.  I guess they wiped out all our culture and subsequent generations just came out dumb.  I really don't care.  Anyway, the alien race enslaves mankind, and there's a lone man who dares oppose them (You won't see this coming, I swear).

Roger Christian was the wrong choice. For some reason beyond me (and could helpfully be explained by Christian himself) he chose to shoot the entire film in Slant-O-Vision. A technique that good directors use to tilt their cameras for effect. Obviously Christian has no idea why but does it anyway. Its a distracting mistake that this film makes which almost makes the viewer tilt their head.
But thats what this film makes me do, tilt my head in awe. Its a low-rate film that looks like it was shot on a t.v. movie budget. Although with 80 million dollars, youd expect more than grubby special effects and lousy diolouge. It looks like Travolta is the only one having fun with their character. While the rest of the cast only appears for a favor.
For sure, there must be alot of angry Scientologists out there for the mockery of this film and writer, L. Ron Hubbard. I am currently reading the book, which is far better than the film.
Although the plot of the book is intriguing, the film somewhat presents a distilled version. Providing only the first half of the book. Surely Hubbards idea of his book translated into this is defninitely not what it deserves. It would have made an interesting film, having hiring someone else to write and direct it.
With the $80 million they had, they would have at least provided better visual effects. But instead gave us obvious green screen effects and matte paintings. You'd think in the year 3000 that the Psychlos would use a bit more advanced technology than Radio Shack walkie talkies.
The only thing I liked about the film was the score by Elia Cmiral. But the rest is a flop. If Christian's Cinematographer had sobered up and put the camera at a regular angle, this film would have been a little bit easier to look at.

This at least should mean it is remembered (or maybe they all want to forget it?)
As to the plot, who cares? Haven't you all seen enough clever plots about aliens and such? The movie has a strained, ""Whose Brain Thinks This Way?"" feel. That and the strong colour filters is enough entertainment. And at least Travolta actually Was Travolta, if you see what I mean. Plus, just you wait, this will be seen in the future by many obscure nerds as a camp classic, deserving a dusty place alongside other fine efforts as Logan's Run and Dune blah blah blah etc. Your science fiction education can do without this movie in the curriculum, but do borrow it from a nerd if you know any.
They put the same manic effort into the DVD as into the movie. It looks and sounds as good as the best of them...

1277058,1,B00003CXIU,"Battlefield Earth appeared on the Canadian Movie Network a couple of months ago, so I finally saw what many has told me was the worst major studio release of 2000.
Some films typically classified as ""bad"" are also so strange that one finds them either amusing, intriguing, or both. While some people may put Battlefield Earth in that category, I can't seem to manage it. There is really nothing interesting here, just the usual explosions and battle for freedom without any interesting context. The evil aliens walk only in slow motion, John Travolta's alien villain cackles and glares endlessly, and it's all quite dull and stupid.
Rather than inducing the expected smug, reminds-me-of-Ed-Wood laughter, one is left staring blankly at the screen wondering if now would be a good time to turn off the TV. Even trying to read between the lines to find some dreadful Scientology subtext seems to be a waste of time. I'd like to think that Battlefield Earth could have been over-the-top, goofy fun, and that director Roger Christian might have been forced to play things straight by star/producer Travolta.
One other thing to consider when renting or purchasing this DVD is a new security feature called Regional Coding Enhancement, or RCE for short. Most DVDs are coded to play only on DVD players in certain geographic regions, such as North America, Europe, and China. Some people who would like to watch DVDs from others regions, such as Japan, purchase a DVD player with regional encoding disabled. The new RCE ""feature"" stops region encoded DVDs from playing on region-free DVD players, so some buyers might have trouble playing the Battlefield Earth DVD.

1277062,1,B00003CXIU,"Wow! What on God's Green Earth is going on here? Attempting to describe how awful this movie is is to extend it credit it certainly does not deserve. What does it say when half of the 5-star reviews are from the ""It's so bad it's good"" crowd? The eloquent derision this thing has elicited gives me hope for the country. What can I hope to add, beyond expressing my feeling of inner shame at having watched this all the way through?
Battlefield Earth is so bad that making fun leaves one feeling unfulfilled; it's like hitting a school bus with a train. I'm pretty sure PATCH ADAMS is a more awful movie, but I'm not sure. However, it IS worse than THE AVENGERS. There's almost something sweet about the fact that in the cynical age of Quentin Tarantino, the Coen Brothers, and Jerry Bruckheimer, that a genuine abomination like this can be panned off as an achievment. Plus, I heard they did a bunch of reediting before they released it on video! This movie has the potential to become a cult classis on the scale of ROCKY HORROR. It's not camp, though, it's just flat-out awfulness in its full glory. It is so boring that even the grotesquely funny parts are underwhelming. Many spew the usual ""the book is so much better,"" but if the aliens are called -in all seriousness- ""Psychlos,"" you can count me out of reading that one.
Scientology apologists claim this movie has nothing to do with Scientology, but so what? The cult will never recover from this hammed attempt to go mainstream. The apologies for this film are as abusive of common sense as is the movie itself. It's beyond bad...deal with it. The ""They hate it because it's science fiction"" ilk are also way off base. BATTLEFIELD EARTH is purely bad science-fiction. Any decent person who likes sci-fi ought to detest this movie. As one reviewer put it, ""I thought John Travolta liked Hubbard;"" is that not the ultimate testament to what this movie is?
Good Lord! How are we supposed to be concerned with the fates of characters who are so absurdly stupid?!? The dumbest strategies are passed off as Machiavellan brilliance; it is inconceivable that this alien race of morons could have managed putting blocks on top of eachother, let alone pulled off interstellar travel. Why would you make humans, who are obviously looking for a fight, more powerful by teaching them what's going on?
I hate to do it...it's like mocking a puppy for wanting a treat...but WHAT is the deal with John Travolta's ""scary guy"" routine? ""Look at me, I'm a bad-guy, you man-animal you. Bwah-hah-hah-hah!"" Half the movie is taken up with establishing that the bad guy is not a nice guy. Duh. Most of the rest of it seems to be about tall guys staggering around in slow motion, firing the stupidest guns you've ever seen. The blatant technical rip offs of STAR WARS, PREDATOR, BLADERUNNER, THE MATRIX, et al, left me speechless. Put simply, though, you only have to look at Darth Vader to be impressed; John Travolta acts a whole movie and can't establish the slightest 'gravitas.'
You could drive a battleship through the holes in this plot. Suspending belief would require a frontal labotomy performed with a chainsaw. The plot has all the creativity of a Hannah Barbarra cartoon.
First we have humans with their all their different method acting arguing about the intricacies of their cave paintings, then we have them debating the intricacies of 1000-year old nuclear devices. Second, the humans are illiterate -albeit grammatically correct illterates- yet when Barry is taught to speak ""Psychlo"" he all of a sudden can read (in English!) the Declaration of Independence (wipe the teardrops, folks)! Thus, he is able to discover Fort Knox, yet John Travolta doesn't know about it. They just wander in to Fort Knox, which looks well-kept, having been abandoned for 1000-yrs. Then he's discussing Euclid with everyone, after having learned from a Psychlo machine that knows nothing of human history.
All of a sudden they stumble on a military base, but they don't tell us how. A fleet of Harriers are in perfect working order, and in a week a bunch of Neanderthals that hunt with sticks and rocks are ready to ""rock-and-roll, baby."" Humans are waging a rebellion, and they are all wandering around under the dome when a crucial part of their plan involves knocking the dome down. Duh. With the banality of cheeze (with apologies to Hannah Arendt), this movie is an oozing sore that leaves the viewer underwhelmed and downright uncomfortable.
I felt sorry for Barry Pepper, the guy was acting his heart out, when the sad fact is, the idiocy in which he is mired makes a fool out of him. The peripheral characters are all terribly acted, the only point of the love interest is for her to blunder into capture, Barry's pals are all stupid, and the Psychlos....",1004832000,17,4796,4.758703481392557

It's a testament to Hollywood perversity that an otherwise talented actor like John Travolta could still have a career after starring in this nonsense, while a very capable actor like Barry Pepper can see his potential crash on the rocks.
Sci-fi material is tricky in movie-making. Directors tend to rely on special effects and concentrate on the look of the film. For instance, I loved ""Blade Runner"" for its sheer atmosphere but still acknowledged its lack of emotional punch. ""Battlefield Earth"" has neither emotion nor unique visuals. The aliens are ridiculously borrowed Klingon scumbag-types while the humans are stereotype post-apocalypse stragglers. The very idea that these cave dwellers could rebel against their alien overlords and suddenly fly sophisticated aircraft is absurd, for starters.
But to go on would be pointless. This movie went quickly downhill, veering between pomposity, satire, fuzzy action and hackneyed dialogue. I loathed this movie, and I was dragged to see it in the theater.

While most awful movies simply just bore you with its passive ridiculousness, this movie, nay film, went out its way to overtly assault my intelligence--and yet I could not look away.  One might say at this point, 'well, then it must have been a good movie.' No, it was brilliantly awful.  And while a brilliantly awful movie can be just as entertaining as a great movie, the distinction must be made.
For example, a great film may have its scenes set up as if its actors were posing for a fine art photograph, but a brilliantly awful movie like Battlefield Earth makes a motiff out of slanting the camera for every single shot, similar to what one may see in the ""Batman"" series of the 1960's.  Or a well thought out action movie, might have its characters perform within their logical means, while a Battlefield Earth has its illiterate tribesmen learn to fly fighter jets within a week.
Having some knowledge of Scientology is useful for the fun as well. In particular is the idea of ""leverage"".  Every character is tying to get leverage over another.  We know this because every time one attempts to do this he announces it.  I've never heard the word leverage used so much in a movie as much as I did in this one.  Coincidence?  This is a Scientology movie: a brilliantly awful one.

I've read War of the Worlds, Dune, Ender's Game, many other SF books (see my reviews, if you don't believe me). Battlefield Earth is not bad because it is SF. It is bad because OF HOW IT WAS DONE. Since when was shooting nearly EVERY action scene in grueling Slow Motion considered a good technique? Slow motion is for the Kennedy assassination or the Matrix, but not for watching people getting sprayed with water hoses and jumping through glass windows. Another thing that really grated on my nerves was the hysterical bursts of laughter that polluted a lot of the movie. In Austin Powers, the outbursts of laughter were funny because they were using it for parody purposes. But Battlefield Earth is not a parody, it is struggling to be a serious SF flick.
 As for the storyline, hey, the book was probably really good--or they wouldn't have made a movie out of it. But who in their right mind would try and cram a 1000+ page SF novel into 2 hours??? Dune is only 500 pages, and they can't do that film justice in 6 HOURS!
 If there was one thing that might have made this movie more bearable, it would be the special effects. But the special effects are really dumb. Planets--made of bad movie scripts and papier mache--blowing up don't even look good. And why did the Psychlos make their buildings of glass? It's the Towering Inferno gone to hell. The spaceships look really dumb, and there is no way they would be able to fly in our atmostphere with those types of aerodynamics.
 Other complaints include: The cavewoman looks like she just stepped out of a beauty parlor. The Psychlos all shoot gangsta-style with those silly-looking staple guns. The Psychlos learned geometry from Euclid? If they were on a seperate planet, wouldn't they have their own geometry founding-father?

1277195,3,B00003CXIU,"""Battlefield Earth,"" the science fiction film directed by Roger Christian, was savaged by critics when it first hit theaters. Were they being fair? I found the film to be wildly uneven and downright moronic at times, but entertaining in general.
Based on L. Ron Hubbard's very long novel of the same title, the film takes place in a future where earth has been conquered by an extraterrestrial race known as the Psychlos. Some of the surviving humans--an ""endangered species""--live like primitive tribesmen, and others are enslaved by the Psychlos, who are raping Earth of all its mineral resources. At the heart of the film is the conflict between Jonnie, a human rebel, and Terl, the Psychlo security chief of planet Earth. This intrigue-filled rivalry leads to explosive results.
The film is an uneven mixture of serious apocalyptic drama and absurdist comedy. The filmmakers don't seem to know if they are making a bombastic sci-fi epic or a spoof of that genre. This cinematic split personality is reflected in the performances. Barry Pepper (Jonnie) performs his role with painful earnestness, as if he were in a sequel to ""Saving Private Ryan."" His performance is oddly discordant with the campy performances of John Travolta as Terl and Forest Whitaker as Terl's assistant, Ker.
The script starts out fine, but soon drifts into stupidity. The greedy Psychlos are so idiotic and sleazy that you wonder how this pathetic race managed to develop technology, let alone conquer other planets. And the film's final scenes involve a plot twist so ridiculous and unbelievable that it's embarrassing: this is bad screenwriting, full of holes.
Still, there is a lot of enjoyable stuff in the film. Travolta and Whitaker have a great comic chemistry, and both actors are clearly having fun with their outrageous roles. There are some genuinely interesting visual flourishes. I found the Psychlo makeup and costumes consistently interesting to look at. And the musical score is not bad at all.

Barry Pepper (main character, heroic and bright Johnny Goodboy Tyler) really is the only reason to watch this movie. With unconventional good looks and raw talent, he manages to perfectly play Johnny, even down to mannerisms I can only assume are unique to this character. The script is unbelievably autrocious, but somehow he manges to add humor, light, warmth, and intelligence, and even a bit of believabilty to the dead words. Another key element would be the sets, which are pretty good, when they are not color-tinted green or startlingly fake. A scene in which Johnny stumbles upon an ancient, decaying Mini-Golf course is perhaps the best scene in the entire movie. All the other characters are rather useless, with the exeption of some of Johnny's rebel friends.
John Travolta, usually a great actor who adds fun and intelligence to movies, is horrendous. He seems to just jump around, in a really ugly and stupid costume, laughing sardonically and saying ""Oh lookit, I'm the BAD GUY!!"". Very odd.
You won't miss out on anything if you skip this movie, but definitely check out some of Barry Pepper's other movies, like Saving Private Ryan or 61*, an HBO production.

Though I think that this movie took more abuse than it rightly deserved, it still didn't live up to the potential material availible in the book. The one thing that could easily have been avoided was how the majority of the main book charaters were cut out. Sure Jonnie, Terl, Chrissie and Ker were there, but I didn't even realize there was a Robert the Fox until I read a cast list. And who in the world was ""Carlo""? It seems like the writer got overwhelmed and roled Dunneldeen, Glencannon, Stormalong and numerous other Scottsmen into the neat little package of Carlo. That's setting aside the Chinise and Africans in the last third of the book. The movie only covered approximately one-third of the book before jumping to three-quarters where you find out the Psychlo home planet has turned into a sun. Overall, it would have been better to leave L. Ron Hubbard's masterpiece alone rather than disgrace its name by giving people the impression that it was just like the movie. If you plan on reading the book, which I highly recomend, pay no attention to the movie. The only resemblance they share is in title and the four main charatcters mentioned above, though Ker is completely different in the book. I'm truly sorry that the addaption didn't go more smoothly after all the material that was supplied for its making and the anticipation leading up to its release. This is just one of those situations where the only way to make a good book to movie adaption is to take the dialogue and action word for word in the movie. It would also help to make it into episodes (like Star Wars) or a miniseries (like what was done for Dune by the Sci-Fi Channel recently) so it could be longer which would allow time to cover everything mentioned in the novel. Any other way just doesn't work as unfortunately can be seen in this movie bearing the now misrepresented name of Battlefield Earth.",997056000,5,2696,4.595435684647303

I don't always agree with the critics, but in this case, they had a point. This movie is BAD. It's not quite entertaining enough to be so-bad-it's-funny, like Ed Wood movies (although Travolta's strange performance adds some amusement). It's just BAD.
The director can't seem to understand the artistic purpose in tilting a camera, so he does it through most of the movie, like a kid playing with a toy. The plot is hopelessly garbled; the script is horrendous. (Now, I know that most people don't see an action movie for the script, but is it wrong to hope for better dialogue than this?) Barry Pepper is given little to do but run from various Psychloes and flip his hair around. (I was quite surprised to learn that he was in ""Saving Private Ryan."" What happened?!)

I'm sorry, I can't take a movie seriously when it casts John Travolta, the guy best known for doing the hustle, as an evil alien. Especially when he is a Psychlo. That's the name of the race of aliens. To me, it sounds like a good name for a pokemon. Can't you see that little anime kid on the TV show saying ""Psychlo, I choose you!"" I'm getting off topic again, but it's for a good cause - to show you how stupid this movie is. And now, I present the actual plot summary.
Battlefield Earth stars Some Guy as Caveman #1. We know literally nothing about him, except that he is slightly more curious than the other cavemen, and as a result of this he rides off into unexplored territory, only to be kidnapped and enslaved by the Psychlos, evil aliens who have taken over the earth. Super-Evil-John-Travolta-Alien needs something to use as leverage over the humans, so he tries to find out their favorite food by letting Cavemen #1 - 3 escape and monitoring them to see what they eat. Cavemen #1 - 3 are trapped in the mountains, starving to death, so they have to eat whatever they can find, which turns out to be rats. Caveman #1 and #2 then vote Caveman #3 off Battlefield Earth Island for being uncooperative, and after that, since I haven't seen Survivor, my compairison of a bad movie to a bad TV show sort of falls apart. Anyway, the cavemen eventually escape, find some other cavemen, get some thousand year old fighter-bombers, and eventually go back to take on the aliens. This is the part I have a problem with, or at least this is the part I have more of a problem with than all of the other idiotic stuff the movie expects me to believe. When the Psychlos invaded the earth, the combined efforts of all of the modern human militaries could only hold up for nine minutes before being defeated by the Psychlos. However, these same Psychlos were all killed by fifteen cavemen with sticks, thousand year old weapons which have not been maintained at all, and most importantly, a complete lack of any military training. It also bothered me that in the final battle, almost all of the cavemen nobly sacrifice their lives for the good of the others. Now, I formed no emotional attachment to the cavemen for the obvious reason that they are all completely interchangeable. When the first one sacrifices himself, it's vaguely sad, like when a goldfish dies. When the second one sacrifices himeself, I'm bored. After the fifteenth noble sacrifice I want to throw a brick through the TV screen.
In conclusion, you should watch this movie when it is shown on TV, with a lot of friends around, to make fun of it. It's quite entertaining. Don't pay money for it though.",995932800,5,2866,4.524084778420039

I have seen it at the theaters and then read the book and trust me, after reading that, I think the movie could have been better. But given what the director and producer John Travolta had to work with, I'd applaud for their effort and putting togeather such a good action movie. I wish the movie had done better than it did.

In plunging headfirst to a completely new standard of big-budget badness, this movie fails utterly on so many levels that it robs the viewer of the simple pleasure of camp.  Travolta plays the alien ""Psychlo"" known as Terl.  Terl is essentially the same obnoxious Vinnie Bah-ba-rino character from ""Welcome Back Kotter"", albeit with more meticulous anunciation and perhaps slightly grander designs.  He is so artificially smug that you want to smack him every time he apears on the screen.  (Unfortunately that happens to be a lot.)  Forrest Whitaker and Barry Pepper, who at least in principle appear to be reputable actors, do their best to attempt to provide subtlety and some charisma to their characters but can't do much with the godawful script.  It says something when the mind-numbing repetition of ""rat brain"" passes for wit.  There are countless other nameless actors who show up and quite often die in seemingly heroic ways; I found myself often comparing their friends various methods of overreacting hilariously to their comrades' deaths.  They were probably terribly agonized that it wasn't their character who got to die.

The director, Roger Christian, who may or may not have been handing out flowers in an airport lobby before floating this us this turd, seems to have picked up several quirky camera tricks from other directors - and then chosen to overuse them hideously.  Truthfully people, i've seen porn that is more competently directed and edited than this.  I have to wonder if another hour of this hackneyed drudgery lies forlorn and neglected in some back studio room.  (If so, let us pray it never be found).  Why use the same patented George Lucas screen wipe every single time?  Why the need to do every other scene in excruciating slo-motion?  And why film every other scene not in slo-motion with a tilted camera?  Remember the Taco Bell commercial where Shaq's neck permanently becomes crooked from eating tacos?  You get the idea...

The production design varies from decent to cheap and kludgey, starting with the Psychlos, who look like a combination between a Klingon and a street pimp.  Extend that to the unconvincing mattes of decaying cities and various other soundstages, which make the film look convincingly like it was filmed on the backlots of a real studio when no one else was looking.  At least the ship effects look decent, although they are only marginally better than your standard FMV intro to a Playstation game.

Sadly enough, I found myself trapped into watching highlights a second time (darn roommates hogging the remote!), I didn't react with nearly the amount of rising bile that the first viewing inspired.  I wondered briefly if the movie wasn't really all THAT bad, but instead I came to realize more that actually that it was the effect of defensive apathy for my life slowly draining from my body; losing forever yet another two hours that could have been far, far better spent.",994982400,9,3204,4.936567164179104
1277322,1,B00003CXIU,"...
The concept at the film's core is viable and filmworthy: Aliens overrun Earth a thousand years hence, only to have the humans they've enslaved rise up in a revolt. It's the execution that sinks the concept, like naming your hero ""Johnny Goodboy Tyler"" (Barry Pepper) and your villains ""Psychlos"" from the planet ""Psychlo"". And of course, the numerous plot holes and inconsistencies mentioned in other reviews (cavemen piloting old Harriers in a few days, a planet that explodes at even the slightest hint of radiation--are we to believe that Psychlo has no ozone layer?). And bad production designs (the Psychlo ships look like shoeboxes, and the aliens look like a hybrid of George Clinton and the Leather Guy from the Village People with oversized codpieces and fake werewolf hands thrown in). And awful dialogue (any one line in this film). And slanted camera work in every scene. And really dumb bad guys who aren't the least bit threatening (Travota gets a bomb strapped to his arm, and he never realizes it until he stupidly sets off the detonator). And awful FX and sound (there's no sound in many sequences, and Travolta's exploding arm looks like styrofoam). And awful music (Elia Cmiral, get into another line of work). And characters we don't care about (everyone in the film). And so on.
I did, however, like Barry Pepper and Kim Coates quite a bit. Pepper's a passionate, intense actor in the Ron Eldard mold, and Coates has an amiable goofiness about him. Both men deserve better than this. So, too, does Forrest Whitaker(as the Fat Albert sound-alike Ker). And I hail from a family of John Travolta fans, so I can only hope that this misfire doesn't end up ruining his career. He's too good an actor to be wasting his time on sludge like this. Too all involved with BATTLEFIELD EARTH, learn from this mistake, and never make a project this idiotic ever again.

Oh my, I can't believe I saw Battlefield Earth in a theatre, yet I do not regret it. I was totally intrigued by the critics' hilarious comments that I wanted to see how bad it was. The movie barely disappointed me. So many elements from every great Sci-Fi were sampled here in an ultra-creative way! Those barbarians learned how to fly jets in a week! Not to mention how those Harriers (They looked and acted like Harriers...) and a flight simulator (Wow~ Free power supply under the ruins!)survived underground for ten centuries. The gold brick incident was plain fun, and the long-awaited climatic ending was more than entertaining. The bomb! The huge bomb was planted on his arm! And he... he... (I guess you all know what happened...) From this film we can also know that we would rather be Kamikaze than shoot the enemy building with the weapon beside us.
Trust me, this movie is just funny, and it nearly beats Monty Python and the Holy Grail. The only difference is that The Holy Grail is a fabulous film. In the world of BE, nothing is logic, and here you can see a lot you haven't imagined a filmmaker would do.

I get the impression that the disjointed end battle is trying to emulate ""Star Wars"" by having a lot of different things happening at once.  But when you get right down to it, that's all this movie is:  A lot of things, happening.  You'd think that being based on a book, it'd have a story... you'd be wrong.

Faulty logic abounds and I fear that those few souls that would find this movie entertaining are the result of the decline in educational standards in the United States.  Most movies that are good require some form of intellectual involvement on your part in order to follow the plot or understand the ending.  Battlefield Earth uses this against you as you try to make sense of the entire movie, thus making it (possibly) one of the WORST MOVIES of ALL TIME.
In my opinion, watching this decreases your IQ by a point each time you watch it, so each viewing seems to get better and better as you get stupider and stupider.

After that everything gets confusing. The aliens are not threatinging at all. In fact they seem to be bored out of theier minds. They make no attempts to capture the humans when they escape and even when they are attaked they still seem bored. In fact you have to laugh when you see them because they are so pathetic.

1277384,1,B00003CXIU,"""Battlefield Earth"" garnered an unprecedented eight nominations for the Golden Raspberry Awards (the ""razzies"").  Having sat through it myself, I can tell you, it is not hard to see why.  It's really hard to describe how incredibly abyssmal ""Battlefield Earth"" is.  It's a derivative, sloppy, shoddy, implausible nightmare of a film, a train wreck, a riot of bad acting from people who know better.  It's the kind of film Edward D. Wood Jr. would have made if he'd had a big budget.  Worst of all, it wastes Forrest Whittaker, who was so excellent in ""Ghost Dog: the Way of the Samurai.""
Occasionally, I am in the mood for a laugh at a really bad film.  At those times I watch something by Ed Wood or Phil Tucker's ""Robot Monster.""  Now, ""Battlefield Earth"" will join them on my list for years to come.",990403200,5,802,4.605633802816901

I am a huge fan of the book and the deviation from the book by the screenplay was inexplicable, kind of like the butchery done in ""The Firm"". Hint to Hollywood: If you make a movie from a best-selling book, don't let a screenwriter hack it to bits; maybe the author knew what he was doing when he wrote it.
Most of the plotholes and logical inconsistencies pointed out here in other reviews were dealt with in the book. Many of them are still present in the movie, but this is not the version shown in theaters. The DVD cover states that it has been edited, and it has, to good effect.
I'm still trying to pin down exactly what was cut/re-edited/added, but overall I enjoyed the movie twice as much on DVD. Maybe because I have lower expectations now or because it's on a smaller screen, but if you hated it in the theaters you may want to try it again.

1277430,4,B00003CXIU,"This DVD was purchased with great anticipation.  I loved the book, but I wondered how the genre of the Sci Fi novel could translate to the large screen.  In my mind, while reading Hubbard's novel, I envisioned the story as in the old Flash Gordon flicks, but in technicolor & digital sound.
The DVD delivered this.  A high quality action matinee feature that had little pretense.  I was pleased with JT's Terl, which is faithfully portrayed as an oafish brute who had no morals.
The interplay between Whitaker & Travolta was hilarious & added a dimension not noticed (by me) in the book.
I would have given more of the thoughtful dialogue of the book to Jonny, but with things moving so fast, this is an understandable trade-off.
The sound is great, with good dynamic range & surround phenomena.  The visuals are a clear contrast of darkness & light.  I particularly liked the bluish psychlo effects, against the Rocky Mountain vistas in accompanying scenes.
I can see why it is selling so well in DVD.  I travel a lot & there are a couple of DVDs that I play on my laptop.  It is pretty funny that in planes or airports, there always seems to be several people who are attracted to the visuals.  It is very similar to MI-2 & Matrix in that way.

1277431,2,B00003CXIU,"This movie is highly entertaining...just not intentionally.  To be fair, the production design is excellent and well-done, and Forest Whitaker is clearly having a blast and not taking this seriously, which loosens Travolta up considerably.
But the stuff this movie asks us to accept at face value is just ridiculous (WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD).  Those superior aliens and their technology are apparently barely a fighting match for our millenium old military equipment when 1000 years ago, when the stuff was new, they took over in nine minutes.  These amazingly greedy aliens, in a universe where gold is the most valuable metal of all, somehow skip over the nation's gold reserve.
My personal favorite is the evil aliens' ""breath gas.""  Apparently, when exposed to radiation, this stuff explodes.  Which means planet Psychlo must have no sun (and thus arguably no humanoid life), otherwise the planet would have blown up before water could condense.  Radiation is everywhere, and if even trace amounts of it set off the ""breath gas"", the Psychlos wouldn't be in their stunning position of breathtaking power.  They wouldn't even be on Earth.
Roger Christian's direction is barely worth a mention.  This is generally just a bad, bad movie, one considerably improved by a group of friends, yelling comments at the screen.

Due to the fact that few movies seem to succeed in providing the same imagery and impact that a book can, it was with apprehension (and my fingerss crossed) that I viewed the DVD. I was not disappointed. In fact I was quite impressed with the job done. Hats off to the producers, directors and actors.
I was particularly impressed with the scenes included in the movie as well as the photography and the editing. For example, the simplified use of special effects, the over the top / campy acting and imagery presentation in a number of scnenes, and even the fact that while there is no blood actually shown in the movie, you sure believe there was.
I thought John Travolta portrayed an well conceived villan and that Barry Pepper did a fine job as Johnny -- good and campy acting on both of their parts.
While a simple story of good conquering evil, with some old time special effects done with an eye (or wink) to the action serials and stories of the 40s and 50s,  I thought BattleField Earth did a very good job of it.

1277435,1,B00003CXIU,"""Battlefield Earth"" is tremendously bad: so bad, in fact, that it will shake your faith in ever watching another science fiction movie, let alone a movie with John Travolta in its cast again, either. The story is a bore right from the get-go, the acting seems solid but is wasted on a terrible plot, and the enemies vs. the good guys sequences seem like something out of a second-rate comic book that has been sitting on the shelves awaiting purchase for many years. Do these people think that all this cheese will just cancel itself out or what?
The movie is based on the novel by L. Ron Hubbard, and if the novel is as bad as this, then it's not as big a shock. But still, the movie takes place in the year 3000, and Earth is no more a collection of countries and cities, but is under the rule of Terl, the leader of the evil Psychlos, who have taken over the planet and have total control of the natural resources and have left all the ""man-animals"" (humans) to fend for themselves. This is where our established hero, Jonnie Tyler, and his group of humans, to restore everything back to its original state and rid the world of Psychlo rule.
So goes the basic, and continually basic, plot for this cheese-ridden sci-fi movie that has no worth for it's money. The story is so full of nothing but contrivance and cheesy effects that in the end, the film has done nothing except make us feel that we have wasted our money. Instead of picking up and going somewhere, it remains as stagnant and uncomfortable as the cheese the movie portrays.
The only thing the movie really can be commended for is its portrayal of Earth gone wrong. The ruins of Washington D.C. are nicely rendered here, going frome wide shots of the outskirts of the ruined city ot its inner streets and burned-out buildings. This was pleasing to the eye, but hardly turns the movie into a style-over-substance flick. This is about as much style as the film has to offer, and despite a nice display of special effects, instead of feeling a sense of awe, you'll find yourself wishing effects of this quality could be extracted and placed in another, more lucid movie.
John Travolta takes the centerstage of this hammy geekfest, at Terl, the leader of the Psychlos. He looks absolutely ridiculous, his costume invoking more laughter from that audience than the cliche jokes he spouts throughout the movie's running time. He is never able to inspire fear or suspense, and his acting is completely flat throughout. I found myself comparing his dreadlocks to those of that one black guy who plays on that soap opera all those years (not a good sign).
His counterpart is Jonnie, played by Barry Pepper. Pepper does what he can to try and bring some life and thrills to the movie, but his attempts to save it from flopping are a flop themselves. He has nothing to do throughout the movie but swim along in a sea of plot contrivance and mixmatched characters, all given a touch of total unbelievability that ruins everything they thought would come off as a serious film.
While this movie may provide some sort of rousing entertainment for a much, much younger set, maybe 10-year-olds, it is nothing new for those of us familiar with the sci-fi genre, and it proves to us all that movies this bad really are uncomfortable to sit the whole way through. I was squirming in my seat, just praying for the ending, which never seems to arrive. I found myself wishing things would pick up, but no such luck. My briefness in this review is a testament to the movie itself: it's short on everything a movie like this needs, filling its holes with loads of cheese and unnecessary twists and turns.",985564800,2,3646,4.584992343032159
1277436,1,B00003CXIU,"I didn't think that 70 million dollars could make such a bad movie.  This moderately high budget film is the worst made film of its caliber that I have ever seen.  It saddens me that with all of the great sci-fi books that could have been converted into a movie, that a second tier author like L. Ron Hubbard book was given this money.
  This movie has adapted a second rate story that is too long and is based on kind of sadistic sarcasim that would have taken a genuis of an author and director to make work in a movie. The story is based on a human characters revolt aginst a shockingly stupid alein overlord.  The stupidity of the overlord (played by Travolta) is supposed to say somthing about the evils of bueracracy in powerfull governments, or somthing like that.  Well Hubbard suceed at this in his books, and no one involved in this movie could do any better.
  If only the problem with this movie were confined to the scipt, I could perhaps forgive it.  But no, the directing was bad, and the editing was simply awfull.  I am no serious film critic, but this movie was painfull to watch even if the story is ingnored.  The effect of the movie was like being stuck in a room with someone you not only strongly dislike, but who also smells bad.  People have talked in other reviews how they liked the sceanery, and stage producdtion.  I thought it all looked like plastic, and was just not consistant with the rest of the film.

From the over indulgent(non-intentional) comedic acting by Travolta to the annoying screen wipes or fades between scenes a la George Lucas style, the only saving grace-like qualities of the film are found in the undeniably grand special f/x and fighting/battle action sequences.

For example, Christian explains why he chose the lighting and camera angles he did for each scene, how he managed to put it all together for such a modest sum of money compared with other films of this type (a shockingly modest sum, actually) and what he was trying to show -- scene by scene.

1277495,5,B00003CXIU,"This movie is really very fun. It's a classic sort of story, in that the bad guys are really bad, and the good guys are really good. This handling of good versus evil reminded me of really old stories which I have read, such as The Odyssey. There is no question about who the bad guy is. He's wearing the black hat. It's unusual, I think, in modern stories, but I found it satisfying.
The visuals are very comic-book like, and quite compelling. Dark and dreary, reminiscent of The Matrix, but not quite as stark. It starts of with a very dead sort of feel to it, but becomes more lively throughout the film. The odd camera angles continue throughout the entire film. During the commentary, the director explains that they had some scenes not filmed at unusual angles, but they ended up cutting them all. The effect was great. The story is about a skewed bad guy with skewed thoughts, and so the scenery, the music, everything is a bit skewed.
The music was great - it supported the film but did not overwhelm it. At times the music seemed to be laughing along with the audience, a sort of ""Ha Ha"" when the bad guy got hurt or something went wrong for him. I thought it was great, and it really appealed to my kids.
The acting was top notch. Ker was so loveable and fallable and ""human"" (for a Psychlo, that is). Terl was really hysterically bad. There was a subtle sort of sneering insidious element to him that was played, I thought, exceptionally well by Travolta. I can honestly say that this was a unique character... I never saw any character even remotely like Terl in any movie before.
I have seen plenty of DVD's with commentary, but this one was different in that every scene was commented on, scene by scene, throughout the whole movie. It was really fun to be ""watching the movie with the director"" as he explained the various challenges and what went on behind the scenes.
One unique positive point about this movie is that, although it is an action movie with plenty of violence, there is no gore. No one is shown dying or dead. There isn't any profanity, unless you count the word ""Crap"" which is only uttered by the Bad Guy. No sex, no nudity, nothing along those lines at all. As a parent, these points are a definite plus.
The kids gave this one 5 stars, by the way. They've watched the DVD several times now.

1277496,2,B00003CXIU,"This sci-fi adventure based on L. Ron Hubbard's novel of the same name is bad, but not as abysmal as its reviews and the public backlash would lead one to believe.  Hubbard, of course, is the controversial author of ""Dianetics"" and the founder of the Church of Scientology of which John Travolta is a devotee.  The story is supposedly allegorical of the psychological imprisonment that human beings face.  The hero, Johnny Goodboy Tyler (Barry Pepper), is thought to be Hubbard as he saw himself, a savior of the human race from psychological bondage.  There is probably some truth to the charges that Travolta produced this film as a tribute to Hubbard to legitimize his name.  He reportedly staked $5 million of his own money to foot part of the $78 million budget.  Claims that it was intended to be a recruiting film for Scientology are probably overblown.  Though I have my own feelings about the danger of cults, I will confine my review to the film itself.
The story started out with interesting possibilities.  An advanced alien race, with a preoccupation with accumulating wealth, invaded earth for its natural resources and pushed the human race to the brink of extinction.  The humans were scattered and reverted to tribal behavior.  Their daily lives were guided by myth and religious superstition.  Humans that were found by the Psychlos were imprisoned and forced to work as slaves.  Johnny is a bright young man known as a ""Greener"" because he rejects accepted ways and is always looking for greener pastures.  He is captured by the Psychlos and he hatches a plot to defeat them to win the freedom of his newfound slave followers.
To this point, the film is fairly solid.  It is tough to believe that established religions such as Christianity would have died out and that in 1000 years there would be no remnants of our technological advancement and no attempts to unite an underground resistance, but I'm always willing to give sci-fi a wider berth.  However, once inside the prison, each scene becomes less and less probable, until one is left rolling one's eyes in incredulity.  We have Stone Age mentality people learning to fly fighter jets in two weeks and flying gloriously into battle against an alien race that supposedly defeated the entire planet's defenses in nine minutes.  Despite being 1000 years old, the fighters look like they just rolled off the production line.  Between flying lessons, our heroes teach themselves how to rig a nuclear warhead, which they intend to transport to the Psychlos home planet to exterminate the entire race.  Not bad for a bunch of illiterates.
The acting is the biggest minus in the film.  John Travolta is an inconsistent actor, who can often be brilliant, but is sometimes awful.  His performance as Terl, the Pyschlo Chief of Security is probably the low point of his career.  It is as if he was trying to play Julius Caesar with Vinnie Barbarino's personality, turning the character into a pompous moron.  Clearly, his passion for the project blinded him to how poor his performance was.  Barry Pepper proved that he is not ready for leading roles with a portrayal that could serve as a clinic on overacting.  Other than Forrest Whittaker, who provided the only thing even close to acting, the rest of the cast seemed to have been recruited from L.A. homeless shelters.
Roger Christian, who has proven himself a talented Art Director, Set Director and Second Unit Director, took an enormous budget and made it look like a TV movie.  The best production credits go to the miniatures and special prop supervisors for the models of the ancient cities and the dome.
This film was punished at the box office, grossing less than one-third of its enormous budget.  I rated this film a 4/10.  It had some interesting elements, a decent premise, and some good visual effects, but the acting was abominable and the screenplay was butchered.  For most, this is a film to avoid.",982368000,15,3935,4.848802395209581
1277497,1,B00003CXIU,"First of all, let me say how much I enjoy science fiction movies, even fairly bad ones, like Starship Troopers and Johnny Mnemonic.  Second of all, let me say I have nothing against Ron L. Hubbard and Scientology; I don't care about the religion and I didn't notice any ""Scientology Propagand"" permeating Battlefield: Earth.  Having said that, Battlefield: Earth was, by far, the worst movie I have EVER seen.  I made the mistake of actually seeing it when it first came to theaters, paying $7.00.  This movie isn't worth going to see even in a $1 theater.  The acting was horrendous, the special effects were not that special, and the dialogue...the words ""pure crap"" come to mind.  I've heard better dialogue in videogames.
First of all, John Travolta is ridiculous as the Psychlo Security Chief, Terl.  In the book, his character is evil and devious, in the movie, Terl is melodromatic and stupid, not as stupid as his aide, played by Forest Whittaker, but still not too bright.  Don't even get me started on his laugh/cackle.  Barry Pepper, who was great in Saving Private Ryan, was awful in this movie, though I think it was more the movie than it was him.  Then there was the annoying camera angle:  if you notice, there was not a single flat shot in the movie.  Every shot was at an angle.  Far from being creative or avant-garde, it was just plain annoying.
Some people may say you just have to accept it since it is Science Fiction.  Star Wars?  The Matrix?  Anyone?  Those two were both Science Fiction movies and they are two of the best movies ever (Star Wars is in the top 20 of AFI's 100 Greatest Movies of All Time).  Science Fiction should never be an excuse.

1277553,3,B00003CXIU,"Being as it's one of the most ridiculed movies of the year (if not all time), Battlefield Earth may also wind up being one of the most misunderstood.  And while a good review may seem excessive praise, if I were holding it to my expectations going in my rating would be much higher.  Written by Scientologist founder L. Ron Hubbard, some close minded critics (I won't name any) most likely dismissed this as religious fantaticism before ever having seen the movie itself.  Knowing little or nothing about Scientology I can only judge the movie it's merits, and while it's not Citizen Kane I don't know anybody who thought it would be.  Sci-fi is possibly the most difficult type of gere film when it comes to crossover success with critics.  If you remember Stanley Kubrick's 2001 opened to poor reviews which were quickly recanted.  I consider it a fair comparision not being a particular fan of the classic space odyssey myself.
John Travolta stars as the evil alien Terl, never taking himself too seriously and playing the role with malevolent delight.  This is afterall social satire and one of the elements of satire is comedy, which Travolta brings in spades.  His cackle, while not in league with Vince Vaughn (who left an indelible print on the role of Norman Bates), will have you rolling in the aisles.  And don't think he didn't have to swallow some pride when tackling such a part.
Terl's the security chief in charge of strip mining the Earth and exterminating what remains of the human race after using us for slave labor.  Maybe I'm reading too much into this (or maybe the critics didn't read enough into it), but I saw this as a metaphor for our mistreatment of the planet, animals, ect.  You see, Terl's alien race is vastly ahead of our own on an intellectual basis, and if that's the only cireria for whom shall live, die and be made a slave of then our captivity is justified.  Just as we justify testing on animals and eating meat with our claims that their inferiority makes their lives of no consequence.
That's not to say the entire movie is all doom and gloom.  There are the typical Hollywood explosions, cheesy make-up effects and bad dialouge you'd expect from a popcorn flick. And Travolta's comedic turn (I'm guess that was his intent), is matched only by his green-eyed assistant Ker (Forest Whitaker).  His dead pan expressions play well opposite John's over-the-top performance.
Being the smarter of the two, Terl hatches plan to extract gold from Earth and return it to their home planet.  The only catch is that it's buried in areas contaminated with nuclear radiation which doesn't mix too kindly with their air supply.  So he takes up the challenge of training a ""man animal"" to mine for gold, in the process giving his test subjust (The Green Mile's Barry Pepper) enough leverage to overturn the Psychlo's iron clasp rule.
With this knowledge Pepper's character, Jonnie Goodboy Tyler, bands together a ragtag group of soldiers and leads a revolt against their captors.  If it sounds farmilar, it should.  Barrowing elements of superior film such as Escape from New York and Aliens, Battlefield Earth can't claim novelty but it shomehow manages to keep you entertained.
Pepper proves himself to be a very capable leading man, though he's allowed the least amount of fun with his given role.  The supporting characters are flat and rather bland but fleshing them out would only bog down a relatively brisk two hours, which is already jammed with action and special effects.
Given critics and audiences reaction, it's safe to assume this one's not for everybody, but anyone willing to examine the underlying themes of the movie I think will be pleasantly surprised.",982108800,5,3701,4.8275316455696204

Got bad reviews in Hollywood because they are not sci-fi fans. This movie is way up there at the leves of ID4 or Stargate. DVD Version,982108800,6,311,4.456140350877193

However, when I rented it I notice quite a few changes had taken place, the movie was alot better. Now the movie still stinks but it was quite a bit better than the theatrical release. Some of the main changes are in the begining 15 minutes. First of all in the theatre the Title ""BattleField Earth"" appreares in cheessy green lettering over the snowy mountain peaks. In the video release they added a outspace earth shot cleaned up the lettering and put the title in the out space shot then moved to the snowy mountains. (where the old title used to be but was no longer). Second major thing. The classic camera wipes had changed.  There were far more scene changes in the begining than on the video release. For example when Jonny and the horse fall down the hill that was a total of 3 scene changes and in the video it was redone as one scene. Also all the ""George Lucus"" wipes are now done side to side where as before some where top bottom left right etc.  (It was like the director had just bought a new video camera and went overboard playing with the automated transition functions.) I could continue but I won't. The bottom line is: I went to the movie theatre to watch an awsome movie but saw one of the worst ever: I was ripped off. Then I was even more dissapointed with the video release because I was expecting a really bad movie, and what I got as a really cleaned up bad movie that was only closer to average than a B movie: I got ripped off again.
So if saw Battlefield Earth in the theatre and you want to relieve your pain be prepared to be ripped off again. The movie has been cleaned up and improved.  (It makes you think that post production didn't even watch the movie before it left for theatres?)",981676800,5,1889,4.238888888888889
1277557,1,B00003CXIU,"Battlefield Earth has a very strange legacy. Having read the L. Ron Hubbard novel over 15 years ago, I task my mental archives...The first memory I recall is of the novel being one of the longest reads, well over 1300 pages! To finish spoke well of the author. It was an interesting premise...An industrial society consumes planets and civilizations in pursuit of minerals and fuel, becomes cruel and arrogant...perishes at the hands of savages. The movie well represented this vision. That Hollywood critics would so dislike this movie, calling it almost universally, ""The worst movie of the year""  ""John Travolta's ultimate failure"" speaks more of egos and general dislike of scifi than of the production itself. Though not great, it was certainly very good. Remember Kevin Costner's ""The Postman""? Another very good scifi hated by Hollywood critics as well. My opinion? Buy the DVD...Big screen, Dolby Surround, see for yourself. Bigs shots, great scenic panoramas and futuristic mattes. This movie is much better than most recent scifi releases, better than ""Wing Commander"" or the ""The Cell"" for instance. Watch for Travolta's wife's cameo as the 7 foot tall secretary with the 15 inch tongue...Next time the critics tell me to stay away, I'm running to the theater. Buy the ""Postman"" at the same time and you'll forgive Costner for ""Waterworld.""

1277562,1,B00003CXIU,"TEN THINGS TO LIKE ABOUT BATTLEFIELD EARTH
10. Kevin Costner didn't produce, direct, write, or star in this film.
9.  Forest Whitaker looks embarassed, and after what he did in Ghost Dog and Species, he certainly has reason to.
8.  None of the bombs have a red LED countdown timer, and no one says ""The blue wire or the red wire?""
7. No one leaps sideways in slow motion while firing a pistol in each hand and hitting a moving target while simultaneously avoiding a hail of machinegun bullets.
6. It's so seldom you hear a villain laugh a genuine ""Bwah ha ha!"" laugh.
5. You can save money: With the price of one rental you can see Dune, Bladerunner, Star Wars, Planet of the Apes, One Million Years B.C., Clan of the Cave Bear, and half-a-dozen other films.
4. The plot made a lot more sense than that of Star Trek: Insurrection.
3. Good news!  Detroit's learned how to make cars that won't rust out in a thousand years.
2. Once you've conquered the universe you don't have to brush and floss.
and the number one best thing about Battlefield Earth:
1. No Jar Jar Binks.",980726400,43,1070,4.4213197969543145

1277635,3,B00003CXIU,"I saw this film twice in the cinema because it was so darn funny. I hooted and hollared like all the other cyncial cinema skeptics drawn to this carcass of a film like so many hungy vultures. I came I saw I laughed.
I ordered the DVD and much to my surprise, the film had been changed. It wasn't made worse by these changes, three ""key"" scenes were added to fill in planet sized plot-holes, but several hilarious scenes were removed to make space for the new material.
I must admit I was disappointed. The new footage of Johnny Tyler and his band of merry cavemen reading a map, or blundering through Fort Hood were fine, but the things they replaced were priceless!
How could you do this too us?
What was once a film so side-splittingly hilarious is now merely mediocre. I hope a ""theatrical release"" appears in the near future so I can recapture those summer afternoons of popcorn spewing hilarity.

1277642,1,B00003CXIU,"Ok...we've all heard how bad it was and all that. That's fine in a review, but most of us kind of wants to know WHY it was so bad. I am going to start with the name of the alien's planet, Pyschlo. Now this is an obvious Earth term, so why in the hell would an Alien culture have this name for their planet? It defys common sense. Then we have the issue of the Alien's language. They are talking in English to us. Why? The directors, for realistic purposes, should have had the movie in sub titles at least. What I mean by that is the Alien's will speak in their so-called language, whereas we would read the english translation of it. It is too much to expect that the Alien's learned our language after nearly wiping us out. Why should they bother? After all, according to the film, we humans were really inferior to them. Furthermore, they even thought that dogs were our betters. Now this doesn't say much for the Alien's intelligence either, or our own in the movie. After 1000 years of being slaves, we all reverted back to cavemen-like days. I find that hard to believe. The few remaining people who survived that first attack of the aliens should have taught the succeeding generations of our knowledge. After all, knowledge is power, something the Aliens in this movie completely forgotten. However, to expect me to believe that we are so brillant as to know how to fly a fighter jet in a matter of days is completely idiotic. We're smart, but not that smart. These are all just basics of the movie that I am picking at. I can't believe the amount of intelligence that the Alien's DON'T show. As some of our other reviewers have said, by the way the Alien's acted, we would have been severely surprised if they even knew how to invent the toilet, let alone take over planets. It was like the Alien's honestly expected us to tell them everything, like we did not have one ounce of common sense for survival ourselves. And lastly, the plot is very poor. Granted, it does follow along rather smoothly in the movie, but the glaring errors of it destroys any beliefs that we might have had about it prior to watching it. No, we sci-fiction fans do not pretend to believe that everything we watch will happen just like that, or with technology that hasn't even been invented. But we do expect some common sense in a movie, and we didn't get it with this one. Watch it and you will come to appreciate the amount of stupidity that went into it. Unlike what some of the other reviewers are saying, I sincerely doubt the fact that Scientology had anything to do with the bad raves. It's just the movie itself.",980121600,4,2607,4.444676409185804
1277711,1,B00003CXIU,"Battlefield Earth has to be, in my view,  the lamest sci-fi story ever produced and by comparison, makes Star Wars an intellectual tour de force of depth and sensitivity!
I haven't read L. Ron Hubbard's original story so I can't comment on how faithful it is to the book. The plot of this screen presentation, however, is about as complex as an early  Bruce Lee movie, pitifully simplistic and totally lacking in conviction.
The earth has been invaded by a technologically superior and agressive race of humanoids who, like the aliens in Independance Day, seek to strip earth of its resources and move on. The human population has been decimated, the survivors pushed back into a primitive stone-age existence in hiding from their alien overlords, their cave walls depicting the ""demons"" they suppose them to be.
However, in true Hollywood gung-ho tradition, the humans rebel against their captors and in the space of a few days, learn (with the aid of alien teaching machines), to read and speak the alien's language, fly aircraft and handle weapons including nuclear bombs. Finally, after discovering a secret, long abandoned US miltary installation complete with a fleet of fueled and airworthy Harrier jump jets and, conveniently, a flight simulator in perfect working order, they battle to take back the earth and defeat the aliens.
The only interesting thing about the aliens is how un-alien they really are and how much they resemble many modern day politicians and industrial barons. They are mean, agressive, cunning and greedy concerned only with cutting a percentage and screwing the next guy. If it were not for a few distinguishing physical characterists such as their green eyes and exotic hair dos, they'd fit right it!
The film could just as well have been about any World War II story of military conquest, racist agression and underground resistance. The special effects give spectacle to the thing but viewers looking for thought provoking ideas or complexities of plot will be disappointed. There's no mystery, nothing to keep the audience guessing and the plot is completely predictable from the first 10 minutes.
That said, the ""specials"" are as good as today's audiences have a right to expect and if your expectations of a good sci-fi story rise no higher than the average game of Space Invaders, then go and see it. John Travolta, Forest Whitaker and Barry Pepper give excellent performances in the film but are so much wasted talent in this, at best, mediocre story.
Concerning the DVD itself - the quality of the picture is sharp, the colours bright with good contrast and it is easily among the best in terms of technical quality. There was an irritating pause half way through which I assumed was the layer change but this can be better or worse depending on the playback equipment.

The story follows that at the present, we are overrun by alien invaders who want nothing less than every ounce of gold on earth. It takes 1000 years for them to do this too (which is pretty stupid), so the story lands us in a time that is around the year 3000 AD. A few humans still live in remote areas that are toxic to the aliens because of a radiation poisoning created by our invasion response of so long ago. A man who lives in one of these areas is recruited when he ventures too far and is taken to the ""dome"". Travolta plays the overseer and tries to train his ""man-animals"" to mine for gold in place of expensive Psychlo workers (it's dumb things like a home planet named ""Psychlo"" that made this movie bomb at the shows- they should know better). Anyway, the man-animals of course figure out a way to obtain nuclear weapons and use them, fly jets that have been grounded for a thousand years and do some other things that aren't really possible even in science fiction.

1277772,1,B00003CXIU,"I had been looking forward to seeing this movie for about fifteen years at least, back when I read the novel in high school, and the cover said soon to be a major motion picture.  How little I was to know how long it would take to be made, or how badly it would be made.  I had my reservations when I first realized the movie wasn't even going to be quite two hours long.  How could they take a nearly 1000 page novel and condense it into an under two hour movie.  Quite easily it seems, just rip everything good out of the novel, end the movie at about the point nearly half way into the book, and put out the piece of junk that they did.  All they kept was the very bare bones of the novel, and twisted it so horribly that I could hardly recognize it.  I have to wonder: did L. Ron Hubbard approve of this?
 The acting in this movie is horrible and too much way over the top, especially by John Travolta.  To say that he wasn't what I was expecting Terl to be like from reading the book would be a drastic understatement.  There wasn't one actor I could recommend as having even done a semi-decent joy in this movie, they all looked like they were sleep walking through it, and perhaps they were, just hoping that the finished project would turn out better than the individual scenes.
 One of the most painfully stupid scenes was when the humans went to Fort Knox and discovered the gold.  If gold was such a precious commodity, even on other planets, it's ridiculous to assume that the Psychlos wouldn't have found it themselves, considering that the building was still intact.  My sense of belief had already been severely strained up until then, but that really took the cake.
 There are also far too many scenes of Terl strutting around, bugging everyone with what he called pictographs, so that he could blackmail anyone who stood in his way.  It was ludicrous, the amount of double crossing that was going on, as deals are constantly being made and broken.  Just unbelievable.
 For your own sake, stay far away from this movie.  Don't rent it, don't watch it if someone else rents it, and if you get it as a gift, return it immediately without even having opened it.  Trust me, you'll thank me for it.",979776000,4,2209,4.372549019607843
1277773,1,B00003CXIU,"I've read many of the reviews posted here, and agree with any rating it 1 star.  Unfortunately, ""kick the director in the groin"" is not a valid rating!  A buddy of mine told me this movie was bad, but I like to decide for myself.  Oh baby was he right.  I've never written a review before due to my extreme laziness, however I felt compelled to write my thoughts on this movie.
First off.  Let's say an alien race takes our planet by force, this still doesn't explain why we would revert to cavemen!
Second.  The aliens dominate us within minutes, and would have seen that we had various technologies, but somehow 1000 years later they manage to think that dogs were higher life forms.
Third.  Everyone mentioned this one, but how are cavemen going to learn to fly fighter jets EVER, let alone in days.
Fourth.  The effects were terrible in some spots, not to mention a lot of failed tries at ripping off other movies.  The fade ins and outs from Star Wars, the shooting scene in the hotel lobby from the Matrix.
Fifth.  The ending is ridiculous.  It's comparable to watching a Bruce Lee movie, where instead of hand to hand combat, one guy jumps in and yell's SPOON, and Bruce Lee explodes for no reason.
I like a lot of movies, even some that most people hate, and I really thought about stopping this movie a quarter of the way in.  It was like a car wreck though, and I couldn't look away.",979603200,13,1393,4.377431906614786
1277774,5,B00003CXIU,"This was probably the best movie of 2000. It had great acting by John Travolta as the magnificient and humourous Terl. He always had something funny to say. Everytime he opened his mouth you were ready to laugh. Great acting on his part. The role of Terl was perfectly suited for Travolta.
The direction is also amazing. I love how the camera always seems to be tilted one way or another, like the director was sick to his stomach. I also like how the colours were washed-out and saturated.
The story was very entertaining and should be told to our kids for generations and generations, so this tale will always survive.

I thought it was a very good movie. Perhaps, I had a better appreciation from reading the book. While many scenes were changed, from book to movie, the overall theme stayed the same. Many have complained that there is no plot, but I had no problem following the story and thought it was good. Granted, the timeline in the movie is a bit crammed together. Events took months to unfold in reading, but in the movie seemed to take a very short period of time. So, I can understand this problem. The special effects were also good. Some have complained about the shimmering effects as being cheap, but they were shown as Hubbard described them. Perhaps the best advise would be to read the book first, then see the movie. Overall I thought it was really good and John Travolta did an excellent job portraying Terl.",979344000,17,983,4.466666666666667
1277776,1,B00003CXIU,"There are many words that go through my mind when I think about this movie but I cannot say them without sparking criticism from various violence defamation leagues. Why this picture ever got funding is one thing, but John Travola planning a sequal (despite the fact this film has LOST money for studios) is beyond me. Let me put it this way: When I go to see a movie that has been brutalized by critics I will go in with low expectations and find the movie not being as bad as I thought. I am afraid this is not the case for this film. Believe me when I say that staying through to the end of this movie was painfull. The urge to walk out was strong, but I knew I had to stay as I would meet up with a fellow geek who would say 'well you missed the surprise ending!'  The reviews praising this film make me think they have been planted by those who are going to profit from the sale of this film. It's time to kill ugly cinema! If you plan to watch this film, get a group of friends! Get as many people as you can! Make sure the studio makes as little money as possible!

Battlefield Earth is a treat for those of us who crave something different, something offbeat.
John Travolta doesn't have to settle for playing conventional roles like ""Michael"", or ""Look Who's Talking"" He can be anything he wants to be.
Battlefield is an exciting fantasty movie. I really liked it. It is metaphorical, note the name of the hero ""John Goodboy Tyler"" How do we know that the premise of Battlefield couldn't one day occur? Aliens invade and reduce humankind to slaves. Somewhat like Battle of the apes.  I liked the scenes of the ruined citys of the USA.  The learning machine was goofy for sure but not in a bad way. The ending was strangely satisfying and I laughed aloud.

While I was watching the movie, it saddened me to see that they covered the first 100 pages in the first 10 minutes of the movie.  The movie takes place in the future where an alien race takes over the earth to mine certain minerals from the ground.  Travolta plays a disgruntled alien security advisor that is looking for a way off the wretched planet Earth.  Barry Pepper plays one of the few remaining humans on the planet.  The movie is slow, jumps about from one thing to another.  It really didn't do anything for me.  The acting was really poor as well, and I wonder why Travolta even agreed do such a thing.  The book was such a wonderful story.  It had a great message about humanity and hope.  This movies destroys all of that and replaces it with abnoxious jokes and a few loud explosions.

1277812,2,B00003CXIU,"Well, I thought that no sci-fi blockbuster could equal Independence Day in its stupidity and disrespect for the audience. Battlefield Earth proved me wrong. I'm glad it was a total failure at the box office - it gives me hope that there are people left who can tell the difference between good entertainment and pure drivel of the type ""wow, again we saved the Earth from them aliens with hairy hands, in lead boots and impossible wigs"". Such concept of aliens would have been good in 1950s, but now it looks ridiculous.
I'd rather not dwell on overwhelming idiocy of Psychloses (with such sense of logics and strategy they couldn't have conquered a cabbage field, not mentioning a planet). Humans are no better portrayed: crowd of howling savages becoming jet-pilots in 5 days, handling nuclear bombs with bare hands, theatrical tears and pathetic speeches mingled with abyss-deep leaps of logics...One can 't stop wondering whether they meant it seriously.
However I'd rather like lupine-looking B Piper in his part (but mostly in the first half of the movie, him being kicked around by Psycloses). As to J Travolta, he always suits to playing ""bad guys"" (Face Off, Broken Arrow), but probably he should refrain from such disgraceful roles in the future (although, I assume, he can allow it...).

However, a second viewing (which, thankfully, was for free) showed that while the first half of the movie is ripe for heckling, the second half is so incomprehensibly bad that one can only stare slack-jawed at the screen, left speechless by the staggeringly inept narrative. There is a huge difference between the suspension of disbelief in something like Independence Day and the insults to intelligence displayed in this film. The book has many problems, but I figured it wouldn't be too hard to make a brainless but enjoyable sci-fi summer action movie from it. I was wrong - it was actually worse than the book. Example: In the novel, ""Robert the Fox"" was an elder, distinguished Scottish warrior. In the movie, he is AN AMERICAN CAVEMAN WITH A STUFFED FOX ON HIS HEAD. That's typical of the level of brainpower that went into creating this mess. That the concept of cave dwellers flying thousand-year old Harrier jets (after only seven days of training, mind you) actually made it past the screenwriter's hard drive and into actual production is mind-boggling. Anyone who thinks that this film was somehow designed to attract people to Scientology should breathe a sigh of relief - this film attracts only flies.

No, John Travolta really did steal the show on this one, he really captured the beaurocratic humor that the Psychlos personified in the book.  It really is all about shifting the blame.  Barry Pepper had a huge amount of energy as the human hero Johnny, but --
Everyone always gives me a very disappointed look whenever I say, ""I can't wait until Battlefield Earth comes out on DVD!""  That's always effective whenever there's a lull in the conversation.  Personally, I think people really wanted to take this movie very seriously, and they did get a big disappointment.
