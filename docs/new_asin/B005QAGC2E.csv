8483013,5,B005QAGC2E,"THE MOVIE ""BRILLIANT MARRIAGE"" IS WELL WRITTEN, BEAUTIFULLY ACTED, AND HAS LOTS OF SURPRISES. THIS IS YET ANOTHER MOVIE THAT SHOWS THAT PRIVATE COMMUNICATION IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND THAT YOU SHOULD NOT ANNOUNCE YOUR PLANS CONCERNING A LOVE INTEREST IN ADVANCE.  THERE SHOULD BE NO ONE OR ANYTHING MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOUR SOULMATE, OTHER THAN GOD. IT HAS BEEN MY EXPERIENCE THAT OTHER PEOPLE MANIPULATE YOUR LIFE TO YOUR DETRIMENT OFTEN WITHOUT YOU EVEN KNOWING IT.  I THINK A SECRET RETREAT AWAY FROM OTHERS IS THE BEST AND MOST ROMANTIC WAY TO GET TO KNOW A LOVE INTEREST.  IF AFTER THAT YOU DECIDE TO GET MARRIED I HIGHLY RECOMMEND PREMARITAL COUNSELING FROM A COUNSELOR THAT SHARES YOUR RELIGION
THE WONDERFUL AND BEAUTIFUL ACTRESS, JOAN MARSH, IS IN ANOTHER GREAT MOVIE THAT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND CALLED ""DARING DAUGHTERS"", STARRING AS BEAUTIFUL MARIAN MARSH'S YOUNGER SISTER. THE WONDERFUL ACTOR RAY WALKER IS ALSO IN ANOTHER GREAT FILM THAT I HAVE REVIEWED (OLDIES.COM) AND THAT I RECOMMEND CALLED ""HOUSE OF ERRORS.""  IN BOTH ""BRILLIANT MARRIAGE"" AND ""HOUSE OF ERRORS"" HE IS  A FRUSTRATED LOVE INTEREST OF MY FAVORITE ACTRESSES OF THE 20TH CENTURY, MARIAN MARSH AND JOAN MARSH.  IN BOTH MOVIES, HIS CHARACTER'S LIFE IS LIKE MINE: SOMETHING ALWAYS GOES WRONG TO PREVENT US FROM GETTING A SOULMATE!
AND FINALLY ""BRILLIANT MARRIAGE"" REMINDS ME OF HOW GRANDPA SWOOPED GRANDMA PEARL OUT OF HER ENGAGEMENT! I WAS JUST A BOY WHEN THAT GREATEST MAN OF MY LIFE PASSED AWAY, AND GRANDMA TOLD THAT STORY FOR YEARS.  WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T FORGET TO HEAR STORIES FROM OTHERS INVOLVED IF POSSIBLE.  LIKE THE WISEST B.C. MAN SAID: THE FIRST SIDE OF A STORY SEEMS RIGHT UNTIL YOU HEAR THE OTHER SIDE! (PROVERBS 18:17).  ALTHOUGH I HAVEN'T HEARD GRANDPA'S VERSION, HE WAS THE MOST HONORABLE MAN I EVER MET! AND GRANDMA PEARL THE MOST HONORABLE WOMAN I EVER MET!
IN LIFE AND IN ""BRILLIANT MARRIAGE"" ALL IS NOT FAIR IN LOVE AND WAR!  LIKE THE WISEST A.D. MAN SAID: WE SHOULD ALWAYS TREAT OTHERS LIKE WE WOULD WANT OURSELVES TO BE TREATED. (LUKE6:31).
ALTHOUGH SIN ALWAYS EXISTED, THE GENERATION OF THE MARSH'S AND MY GRANDPARENTS IS INDEED THE GREATEST GENERATION!  MOST OF THEM TREATED OTHERS LIKE THEY WOULD WANT TO BE TREATED, SOMETHING SORELY LACKING IN THE 21ST CENTURY.
