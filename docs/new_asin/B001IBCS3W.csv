8310680,5,B001IBCS3W,A must if you're interested in an incredible documentary on NASA's second major disaster. I reference it during safety lectures.,1437955200,,128,5.45
8310681,5,B001IBCS3W,great DVD on an awful disaster :(,1421971200,,33,3.857142857142857
8310682,5,B001IBCS3W,"The loss of America's first space shuttle, the 'Columbia', and its 7 astronauts, in February of 2003 was felt around the world as well as in the United States. While NASA had not lost an astronaut since the 'Challenger' accident in 1986 - a 17-year period - it was believed by many that NASA had become somewhat complacent regarding safety issues. This NOVA program sheds a light on the accident itself and the investigation into its causes. Interviews with NASA officials, families of the crew (most notably Laurel Clark's husband, Jon) and investigators all shed light on the loss of the Columbia. It is mentioned that NASA did not believe, at first, that the foam strike had crippled Columbia's heat-insulating tiles on the wing, and also outlined the possibility for an in-space rescue that would require the launch of a 2nd shuttle.

Through footage of the liftoff, mission, accident & investigation, the Columbia tragedy's causes are revealed. Well worth picking up for anyone interested in spaceflight.",1421020800,,1009,5.078313253012048
8310683,5,B001IBCS3W,"This was the second space shuttle lost in the long history of shuttle flights.  Nova shows its ability to sum up the massive and detailed investigation that followed the tragedy.  They also review the history of the shuttle program to show what led to the two disasters.
  There were two basic problems that dogged the shuttle program throughout its entire history:  one was the lack of money and the other was the tremendous number of technical problems involved in getting things into earth orbit.  Everyone wanted the shuttle to succeed; everyone wanted space flight to become safe, inexpensive, and routine.  It was never inexpensive or routine, and the only reason it was relatively safe was because of the care and attention given to each flight.  Since there was always pressure to make it cheaper and routine, sometimes the safety problems took a back seat.  Cutting costs and ignoring possible problems led to tragedy twice.
  In both the cases, the Challenger explosion and the breakup of Columbia, there were strong indications of problems that were set aside. Complacency took over in both cases because nothing had gone wrong, so nothing would go wrong.
  In the case of Columbia it was a problem with the insulating foam.  They assumed that the foam, which is very light, wouldn't damage the craft if it collided with it.  After the accident, it took an experiment on a mockup of the shuttle's wing to prove that it would, and had done just that.
  The shuttle was a marvelous piece of machinery, well ahead of its time, using materials and techniques that were new and crucial in getting it to work.  They wanted a vehicle that was cheap and reusable:  they got half of that.
  Nova did an excellent job of covering all of this and more.  They actually show video of the crew taken just moments before the shuttle began to break up.  It is heart-rending, but it's also good to know that many people will try to learn how to make things better.",1409961600,2,1958,4.727810650887574
8310684,5,B001IBCS3W,This reveals the entire incident by laying out details on why and how this get happened.  It is no surprised to see eventually the NASA bureaucratic should be blamed for the major part of the cause.  I like this title and will continue supporting Nova's titles.,1368662400,3,261,4.6521739130434785
8310685,5,B001IBCS3W,"I actually bought this as a gift for my spouse.  I had previously seen parts of it, and they were so fascinating.  Basically, the crew of the Columbia had no idea they were in any jeopardy, although those on the ground could see there was damage and there was a significant chance the landing would end disasterously.  The case for and against telling the crew and consideration of the options was shown and documented.  The most heart rending thing was that the audio and video recording of the crew preparing to land was recovered.  Obviously they did not have any undue concerns.  This was all shown on this remarkable DVD.",1365120000,3,626,4.6454545454545455
8310686,4,B001IBCS3W,"This video is good. It reached me a day before schedule, just in time for the training programme we planned to show it in. I was told before hand that people outside the US may have trouble in viewing this video, but I had no problems at all here in India. All in all a good experience. However I thought the same thing shown on TV had more about test firing the foam on to the wing. Maybe I am mistaken.

8310687,5,B001IBCS3W,"After viewing this video on the PBS net, I ordered through Amazon.com.
The item arrived in excellent condition as ordered, I am very well pleased, as usual -- I am a continuing customer!",1244851200,2,186,4.666666666666667
8310688,5,B001IBCS3W,"The Columbia Space Shuttle Disaster video is an incredible production. The producers did an exceptional job of making the case for the importance of responsive leadership within all organizations. After reading the official report and viewing this video, I have formed the opinion that the Columbia crew did not have to die. I'm sure others will find the back-story very compelling. I highly reccomend this video.",1241395200,6,413,5.2727272727272725
