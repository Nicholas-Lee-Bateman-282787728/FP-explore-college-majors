The title is taken from a particularly excoriating review of the band's 1994 album ""Glum"", which appeared in Rolling Stone; in one scene, the band dissects the review with grim humor. Clocking in at one hour, the film supplies a tantalizing glimpse of the band's creative process and their Tucson stomping grounds. Unlike many rockumentaries, some of the offstage banter is surprisingly entertaining. In a similar vein as much of the band's music, Dissard's film pieces together an overall impression from fragmentary bits of materials; she prefers vignettes linked by common themes to overarching narrative. While you might wish for lengthier portions from live performances and studio sessions, Drunken Bees is a gentle, affectionate portrayal of the witty humor and lo-fi inventiveness of Giant Sand""
