6498230,2,B00LPD0HNG,"I gave it 2 stars just to be nice. Lots of issues here. I had to stop watching. I'm a bit of a zombie snob but I will give a movie a chance. I'm all for indie low budget endeavors but a little more thought, better audio mixing, and better writing/acting was needed. Here are the issues that made it so I could not finish watching the movie:

1. The zombies growled like bears very loudly. The audio mixing with the music and dialog kept being ruined by this. It made the movie not watchable for me. Overall the audio mixing was bad.

2. The mythology of needing to damage the zombie's brain/head was ignored. This seriously made the movie lose credibility in my mind.

3. The initial sound track was a not so great throw back to the 80s. Then suddenly it was a bizarre death metal fest. Very distracting.

4. The zombie movements (shuffling and running) were corny and it looked like the actors were told to just limp.

5. The dialog and acting were not very good. The deaf girl did well ...

6. The main character had a semi automatic weapon in one hand and his wives ashes container in the other. He simply would not put her precious ashes in a pocket. It was driving me crazy at the beginning. I don't know if he ever put the ashes container in his pocket eventually but I had had enough. I got to the point that I didn't care and stopped watching.

7. The main movie poster picture made no sense.",1415750400,6,1400,4.260377358490566
6498231,4,B00LPD0HNG,"I debated whether to purchase this or not considering the first one was a complete snooze fest. I had some cash, felt cocky, & bought it. I thought the film was well done & far better then the first one. If you watched the first one & wondered what the hell it has to do with this one it is explained in the end. It's divided into 2 stories really- a former army guy has a cool suit & kills zombies while trying to get to the ocean to scatter his dead wife's ashes. Second story is a deaf girl who is almost raped escapes & runs into the army guy. They form a friendship with another survivor & head to the ocean then save a group from zombies & one of the little girls is the army guys little girl. Good movie, decent effects, recommended.",1414022400,,740,4.075342465753424

6498234,4,B00LPD0HNG,"I am not an actor or a movie director, but I can tell a good movie from a bad in the zombie genre.  If you read my review about the first movie-then you know I didn't like it and was truely amazed at the length of the credits.  Marketing got an A+ on the first movie due to the box not actually having any photo resemblance to the movie and the fact that so many people invested in it.  Sick, that is right, sick curiosity is why I purchased the sequel to the first and watched it.  I figured  it couldn't be worse than the first and was actually suprised that Rene Perez found funding for a sequel.  He has gotten better and learned a lot from the first...urp...film.  Hokey-yes, there is hokey, but there is also female upper frontal nudity!  This story flows, and the acting is actually fine.  Forgive him for using the same zombies, over and over in different clothes, it wasn't bad.  Make-up was better.  The characters were likeable.  Here is the storyline.  Our main character is a handsome Army Colonel that has travelled from the zombie war in North Africa to Wyoming to rescue his pretty wife and daughter for this zombie outbreak.  He believes they are dead from the skeletal remains and cremates their bodies and collects their ashes in a thermos and is traveling to the ocean for a sea burial because he never fulfilled his promise to take the land lubbers to see the ocean. ~whew~ still with me?  Please don't notice the map he is using to get from point A to B is one to get you from Philadelphia to the Atlantic ocean...  Along the way, he meets a young, attractive deaf woman and an older bearded guy.  They continue their way to the ocean and also consider a hydro-electric dam as a potential home, however, our Colonel only wants to bury them and kill himself.  During the movie, you learn about each character, and there are some good locations.  There is a mall scene, and a train yard.  Please forgive him for the  police roadblock scenes that add nothing but stupidity to the storyline.  Near the end, we find out why there was a zombie outbreak, and why it ties us to the first movie, and a political statement that pretty much states that the ""White"" elitists caused it. Oh well, I hope that Rene doesn't really feel that in real life!  There are a few surprises and plenty of battles along the way and you decide if you like the ending! I did.
  Rene's improvement was about 99% over the first movie and I feel with a little time this writer, director, producer will get better and better!  Good Job, Rene!  (Please zombie buffs-this is not a WWZ caliper movie!  This is not a high-end, professional actor production-this is a b-movie, zombie flick)  Thanks for your time-zombie fans!",1412899200,5,2710,4.473469387755102
6498235,3,B00LPD0HNG,"If you missed the first one, or forgot what it was about, this DVD has a trailer for it. You can watch it before watching this one so you too can scratch your head and ask where is the continuity? Don't fret. The Speaker of the House provides us with an explanation why this is a squeal from the Shasta Lake, California government building.

Army Lt Colonel Sawyer (Robert Tweten) is on a quest. He needs to scatter the ashes of his wife in the ocean during the zombie apocalypse because....without that we don't have much of a story. He meets a few people along the way including  Stephanie (Iren Levy) a deaf mute who can scream occasional words, but can't talk. She is the only other developed character. We discover the cause of the zombie outbreak and get a generic class warfare speech to boot at the end of the film...in case you cared or are still watching.

It seems the zombies are the old Italian kind who must first rip the blouse before they bite. The indoor sound was uneven and changed during a conversation. I suspect this will be part of a $5.00 4-pack within a couple of years.

No sex scenes. Attempted rape. Nudity (Iren Levy, Raven Lexy) 2 1/2 stars $9.96 Walmart",1412899200,3,1184,4.442396313364055
6498236,5,B00LPD0HNG,"I was excited to see this movie because it is filmed in my home town. Some may think this was green screened but anyone who has been to the Shasta Dam knows that this was really filmed on location. Not sure how the director pulled that one off but my hats off to him, being a ""local boy"" I know how tight security is there.

The imagery is superb and the locations truly look abandoned as if the zombie apocalypse really happened. I know this is a ""low budget"" film but I really enjoyed the acting was amazed at how well it was put together for the money. I watched this at a premiere and couldn't wait to own a copy.

Rene Perez seems to be someone who is dedicated to making high quality films for very little money. I would assume something big is going to happen for this guy someday. I will keep watching out for his movies and see where they go. Cheers.

My only critique is...I think that the back cover should have been the front cover because I don't think I ever saw a Zombie with a gun. OH, I really enjoyed the slow motion zombie kill in the Dam corridor. YEAH!

6498237,4,B00LPD0HNG,"When I first heard a sequel was in the works for THE DEAD AND THE DAMNED, I got excited.  I reviewed the first film here a couple of years ago (prior to The Big Blog Crash), and I really enjoyed it.  The concept of zombies in the Old West is not a new one, but director Rene Perez offered an entertaining jaunt nonetheless.  So obviously, when the sequel came out, I was expecting another foray into the past.  Unfortunately, thats not what I got.  Instead, this film fast-forwards to the modern age, where a zombie apocalypse has overtaken the planet.  And although this movie is pretty decent overall, I don't think I would have called it a sequel.

First off, I have to state that I did enjoy this film.  It is fun, well made for a low-budget flick, and it has a lot of heart.  But I have to follow up my statement with a big However.  I liked it, however I was disappointed with it as a sequel.  If it had been a stand-alone film, I would have enjoyed it much more.  Aside from a brief explanation towards the end of the film, it has nothing to do with the first.  Even more confusing is the DVD artwork on the front, which shows a zombie cowboy on the front with a zombie horse and six-shooter!  Still, the film is entertaining, so I will conduct the rest of this review as if it were a singular film.

THE DEAD AND THE DAMNED 2 is shot well and looks good onscreen.  Just like the previous film, a lot of effort was put forth to make it look like a high-budget production.  This is a testament to the hard work and dedication of the production team.

Likewise, the acting is pretty good.  Usually, lower-budget features cannot boast a talented cast.  The opposite is true here.  THE DEAD AND THE DAMNED 2 has several talented actors, including Robert Tweten, who portrays the main character Sawyer, and Iren Levy, who does a great job as the mute, Stephanie.

Im a little mixed on the special effects.  Most of the zombies wear masks, which look good for the most partbut in some scenes, you can definitely tell they are masks.  This is especially evident when, in one shot, you can see the normal flesh around the eyes of a burnt-faced zombie.  Thankfully, the masks are grotesque enough that its not very distracting overall.

All in all, I have to give THE DEAD AND THE DAMNED 2 a thumbs up.  Its low-budget, living dead fun that zombie fans will enjoy.  But don't expect THE WALKING DEAD when you watch this.  Just go into it with the right mindset, and you should have a good time.",1412640000,4,2492,4.356521739130435
6498258,3,B00LPD0HNG,"A little slow, but worth the watch, if you like B indie movies, like a lot of us do.",1448582400,,84,3.473684210526316
6498259,4,B00LPD0HNG,"This movie got some bad reviews, but I quite liked it. They had a few twists in the plot, which I like. The zombie makeup was pretty decent, not just fake blood on torn clothes, with the exception of 2 face masks that made the zombies look like manikins.

Even little stuff was good. I love the camera angle when they're driving in the van towards the ocean. They mounted a camera on the drivers side rear roof, viewing the road and seeing the actor driving in the rear view mirror. There was a deaf survivor in the movie and she seemed to fit in realistically - I think a bad movie would have messed that up and done a cheesy job at it.

I don't want to give away plot, but they sort of got safe from zombies and then the story kept going. It's like Full Metal Jacket, where the first story was in boot camp (and would have made a great movie by itself), then you're please as the movie carries into the second story in Vietnam.

I love that, after a zillion zombie movies, the army in the plot came up with a zombie bite proof suit of armor, like a shark suit. I did think using a sledge hammer was a bit hokey. I think the army would have come up with a cool samurai sword for their cool zombie armor.

They did seem to put zombies down without head shots, which didn't make a lot of sense, but once I realized they didn't need head shots, I was at peace with it. I guess this means I wasn't at peace until I figured that out.

Overall, I just liked this movie - not super great, but pretty great. Amazon Prime, please keep bringing us little gems like this one.",1446854400,,1565,4.118032786885246

I saw that there was a sequel and couldn't believe that someone would fund it, so naturally, I had to give it a go. Acting is pretty terrible as is the actual dialog, the zombies seem to have really phoned it in. The music is terrible and absolutely does not fit anywhere in the film. Make up effects look like something a first grader would do in a bathroom mirror ten minutes before Halloween trick-or-treating...pretty bad.
