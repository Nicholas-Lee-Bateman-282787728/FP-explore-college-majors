I guess the Chinese did the English tranlation and used the Chinese tranlation of the Japanese Kanji names. But the story was excellent.  Only, we could only imagine the final couple of minutes of the final story.",1440806400,,295,4.745098039215686
8448985,2,B001BAVLDS,"I love the drama itself.  But I've seen screenshots from this particular copy and the subtitles are horrible.  Don't buy unless you have better soft-subs to go over it or actually understand Japanese. The subtitles are in a large font about a quarter of the way up the screen and are very distracting.  They also contain a lot of errors.  This same company is selling many other false copies with mistakes such as ""I have unfinish business"" and other grammar mistakes.  If you want to support the drama and and not the crappy bootleg version, buy it from the Japanese Amazon instead.",1340323200,2,583,4.676470588235294
8448986,5,B001BAVLDS,"This show will make you laugh and cry! Last Friends tackles issues that afflict the current generation. Michiru's mother has brought a man back to their home and she is bullied at her workplace where she works as a beauty parlour assistant. She starts cohabiting with her boyfriend, a good young man who works at the Child Welfare Division and the only person who can give her emotional support, but ends up the victim of domestic violence and becomes fearful of love. The boyishly charming Ruka was a classmate of Michiru's in junior high school. She has performed brilliantly as a motocross racer and aims to win the national championship, but as the story progresses, a deep worry that she can neither confide in her parents or close friends grows evident. Takeru is a hair and makeup artist acquainted with Ruka. He is a good confidant to females due to his kindness and perceptiveness, and finds himself attracted to Ruka but has a phobia of sex as a result of a past trauma. The three of them become house mates and through their associations with others, gain the capacity to be positive about life.

Buy this drama, you won't be disappointed!",1218931200,8,1150,4.721393034825871
