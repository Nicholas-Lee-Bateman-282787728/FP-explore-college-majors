5781924,5,B00D97DMQU,"I watched these shows when I was a kid and have not seen much of them since. Enjoying them much more than I thought I would. The quality for picture and sound is very good, maybe four stars. But I have to go with five stars because Dobie and his co-stars are so good. Especially Maynard before he became Gilligan. They just don't make them like this anymore. It beats any sitcom that is on TV today.",1380672000,2,399,4.194805194805195

5781926,5,B00D97DMQU,"First let me say, anything and I mean anything with Bob Denver get's 5 stars in my book. But, more importantly, this is where BD got his start. This is where he became the man who would become Gilligan, etc. Unfortunately he would become typecast after GI, but that's for another review. I do not yet own this show, but I will after it comes out. This is a must for any dvd collection, and any dvd collector of comedy at it's best. Unfortunately this show did not do much for it's star Dwayne Hickman, but it did a lot for Bob Denver or should I say Maynard G. Crebbs?

5781928,5,B00D97DMQU,"I remember watching this when I was a kid --- I'm 64 --- had quite the crush on Tuesday Weld...
I believe that she made a guest appearance on THE FLINTSTONES as the character ""Wednesday Tuesday"".
Well, anyway, I think that I'll own THIS first season until the entire series is within MY modest
budget.

Tuesday Weld is a LOVELY seventy-years-old!

5781929,5,B00D97DMQU,"When I heard this show was officially coming out on DVD I was psyched!  My enthusiasm was tempered when it was first announced as a pricey $120 complete series version but now that I see it will be made available by season, those of us that are cost conscious can whet our appetite on this classic as well.  To me the first season is essential 50's sitcom TV.  First we have the 4 main characters, Dwayne Hickman as Dobie, Frank ""I'm gonna kill that boy"" Faylen and Florida Friebus, as his parents and the irrepressible Maynard G. Krebs as portrayed by Bob Denver.  This season also contains nearly all of the Tuesday Weld appearances as Dobies favorite love interest, Thalia Menninger(all but her single episode appearances in seasons 3 and 4)  as well as Warren Beatty's appearances as Milton Armitage , introductions to Sheila James as Zelda Gilroy, Steven Franken as Chatsworth Osborne Jr., Doris Packer (playing both Milton and Chattsworth's mom)as well as guest appearances by Jean Byron and William Schallert as two of Dobies main teachers(Later of Patty Duke parents fame) Yvonne ""Bat Girl"" Craig, Darryl Hickman, as Dobie's brother, Mel Blanc, Burt Mustin, Charles Lane, and many other character actors of the day!  I may eventually end up with all 4 seasons but its much appreciated that there is now an option for individual seasons as well!",1371513600,37,1352,4.856521739130435

5781958,4,B00D97DMQU,"The Many Loves Of Dobie Gillis was an entertaining and funny old TV show.  The Maynard G. Krebs beatnik character is quirky and hilarious as played off the Dobie Gillis character.  Thus, my 4-Star Rating is for the show itself.  As an Amazon Prime member, however, I am curious about the price-gouging of Prime Members.  I also subscribe to Netflix, Hulu, and multiple premium movie channels through my local provider.  So, WHY would I pay per episode for shows like these on Amazon?  I get FREE access to HBO Go, StarzPlay, EncorePlay, Showtime Anytime, etc.  This particular TV show (plus many others) is also available for NO EXTRA CHARGE on Hulu along with many more like it available as well.  WHY are all episodes of this TV show NOT PART of my Amazon Prime Membership fee?  My rating for Amazon price-gouging their Prime Members is 1-Star or less!",1463270400,,854,4.716216216216216

5781984,5,B00D97DMQU,"One of the earliest really great tv shows. I was six when it came on in 1959, the same year shows like Twilight Zone and Steve Allen were on. Ernie Kovaks had a high-brow comedy show my father loved, but ""Dobie Gillis"" was the first show made for teenagers, when they could still think. This first year features classmates Tuesday Weld and Warren Beatty showing some real acting skills. Bob Denver was amazing as Maynard G. Krebs, the ""Beat Generation"" getting a nod in this one. All in all, if you are at least sixty-two or older or watched it years ago on re-runs, it is still better than any show in the last at least twenty-five years. I am actually enjoying the show more this time around now that I at least understand the jokes.",1428192000,5,735,4.411764705882353
5781985,4,B00D97DMQU,"Never got to see this show as a kid, but heard so much about it. After watching all of Season One, I can see why it has such a following. Great acting, writing. comedy and slapstick. Everyone delivers their lines with conviction, though there is a surreal feeling to many of the episodes. One minute Dobie is telling the audience how his dad will be okay with a request for date money- the next moment the screen is filled with Mr. Gillis' screaming face. Comedy gold.

Maynard G Krebs is Bob Denver's finest hour, everyone's favorite beatnik cringing in horror whenever someone mentions such commitment- heavy words as ""marriage or ""work"". Tuesday Weld is effective as Dobie's hopeless love interest. But it is Zelda who provides many of the best performances. Positive that she and Dobie are destined for marriage, she calls his parents Mother Gillis"" and ""Father Gillis"". And then there's the long-suffering Mr. Gillis, whose rants and histrionics put Archie Bunker to shame.

The reason for the four stars is due to the uneven quality of the episodes. While ""The Chicken from Outer Space"" and ""Here Comes the Groom"" are classic comedy, about a third of the episodes are like, dudsville, man.

5782017,5,B00D97DMQU,"I like the fact that SHOUT! releases classic TV Series like Dobie as complete sets, all the seasons collected in one brightly designed box, and the company actually has begun practicing a reverse approach to the more or less established way of selling an individual season, seeing how the show does before committing to putting another season out for the collectors. If you love a series, and you want every season, there's a cliff-hanger element added, because, Hey! You never know if the company will continue or just abruptly abandon it. The question can linger for months, even years, if the show will ever be available in its entirety on DVD.

As a storyteller I also love that being able to view every episode over a passage of time means that I can see how a series like Dobie evolves, from conception and then from season to season. In this set you really can discover the shifting in tone in Dobie Gillis. I would have sworn before viewing these in this newly released DVD set that Dobie's father's angry/energetic/exasperated/sometimes a forlorn lament: ""I gotta kill that boy!"" ran through the course of all four seasons of Dobie, but it doesn't. He only pitches the line at the departing Dobie in the first season.

I suspect, as iconic as the line became for the series, someone behind the scenes decided that it was too harsh a litany to use week after week, from a father to a son, and that Herbert D. Gillis had to be mellowed down a bit, and their familial relationship not as dysfunctional.

See, you could not realize that if you only had the first season.

Or watch a performer come in for what may have been a one-shot episode, and so captured the writers and/or producers and/or the audience that half a season later that person becomes a full-fledged member of the supporting cast.

The neat thing about this release approach by SHOUT! is that after they make the complete sets available, they then release them as single season sets. Now, if you're only interested in a particular season, you only have to buy that one. Or if the completed sets are too expensive, and you can only afford one at the time, you can also still have episodes from the series.

The entire RIDING SHOTGUN column with clips from DOBIE GILLIS is up on COMICS BULLETIN.
If you enjoy this part of the Dobie piece, I suspect you'll find the clips and comic book cover reproduction
