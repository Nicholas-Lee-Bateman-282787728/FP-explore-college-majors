7570338,5,B019D3J46U,"Not perfect, but it was entertaining.  That's the most important thing.  Jeff Allen was good in this.  He also does really well in Medusa.  He's a rising star!",1498953600,,159,4.571428571428571
7570339,1,B019D3J46U,"This is a hilariously bad movie...slow, bad acting, low budget, one of the bad guys can't get his accent straight. He keeps changing it. Wow!!!",1489795200,2,143,4.76
7570340,1,B019D3J46U,This was a painfully bad movie that got worse as it went on.  The IMDB rating of 6.6 is a joke.,1489104000,2,95,3.5238095238095237
7570341,1,B019D3J46U,"So poorly acted, mob guy kept changing accents. Kids were ok, but everyone else was terrible.",1488672000,2,93,4.875
7570342,4,B019D3J46U,"great i guess,just that it was a little too short of a movie",1487462400,,60,3.6923076923076925

7570344,1,B019D3J46U,Horrible movie. Couldn't watch it for more than 10 minutes. Very bad acting by everyone.,1484524800,3,88,4.933333333333334
7570345,5,B019D3J46U,"What a fun movie; especially some of the subtle humor and the use of mob stereo types.  While the acting and dialogue was only okay, I really enjoyed the plot.  This movie is suitable for 12 and up.",1484265600,2,198,4.184210526315789

8744718,1,B019D3J46U,"One star is too many stars. This movie is soooooooooo bad. The concept is bad. The script is bad. The dialogue is bad. The acting is horrible.

So in that sense, it's kind of fun to watch.",1521072000,,188,4.081081081081081
8744719,1,B019D3J46U,If I could give no stars I would. Terrible acting and waste of time. Even my kids found it painful.,1514678400,,99,4.0
8744720,1,B019D3J46U,"Not enough of any value to merit even one star. I have seen better school plays. I could probably entertain myself more by making finger puppets and letting my imagination go wild. Actually, even imagining I have finger puppets is more amusing than this film.",1513987200,,259,4.777777777777778

8744725,1,B019D3J46U,This was not very well filmed and the sounds on some of the actors was too loud or too soft. Has a good moral though,1502928000,2,116,3.68
8744726,1,B019D3J46U,"This movie is extremely cheesy, like I had cheese whiz coming out of my eyeballs just watching it lol. It looks like somebody recorded this off their phone and then asked some random people they saw on the side of the street to act( if you can call it acting)for their  movie, Trust me you are better off watching Dora the explorer than this.",1502236800,2,342,4.34375
