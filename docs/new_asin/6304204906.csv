812949,5,6304204906,"A remake of the excellent ... 1934 version with Lee Tracy, Minna Gombell, Helen Mack and Henry B. Walthall. Hope is a racetrack bookie who gets in trouble with big-time gangster; he tips Nolan on a sure thing and the gangsters puts down a large sum of money and loses-he wants the money back or Hope's head! Bob works well as a fast talking bookie and the comic situations he's thrown in are hilarious........... The Lemon Drop Kid mistakenly gives a gangster's moll a bad tip on a dog costing her 10 grand..........His only hope? A phoney Santa Claus scam - shame on him! The always fun Bill (Fred Mertz) Frawley is here playing Gloomy Willie - he was in the original (excellent) 1934 version as well! The London born Bob Hope, 98 and still living at this writing was an incredibly youthful 48 here; the female lead was the lovely Marilyn Maxwell; the Christmas standard SILVER BELLS was introduced in this one.",947721600,2,912,4.601226993865031

813317,5,6304204906,"A classic Bob Hope movie, complete with his ad lib quips.

Hope plays ""The Lemon Drop Kit"", a con man who tries to through the outcome of horse races by making people think he can understand horses and which will win... kind of a 40s version of ""The Horse Whisperer""... he gets the horses to ""comply"" by feeding them Lemon Drop Candy.

Things go awry, however when he convinces a mobster's moll to change her bet, only to have her original choice win... the mobster plans to give Lemon Drop cement overshoes but he manages to persuade him that he can raise the money he lost...

The rest is hilarity and hijinks as he creates a scam to raise the cash, only to have another mobster try to muscle in on him.

This is also the show that introduced the ""Silver Bells"" to the world... Hope actually has a pretty good voice to go along with his comedic genius.

I won't spoil the rest of it... you'll have to watch it for yourself and see how it turns out.",1514073600,,950,4.284916201117318
813318,5,6304204906,"Not long after Hope died in 2003, I visited a display on Hope put up in Washington DC at the Smithsonian.  One display was a short clip from this classic movie.  I came up and stood behind a power broker in a thousand dollar suit and a maintenance worker in dirty coveralls on a break and watched as they all guffawed watching Hope in this movie in a scene where he tries to mimic a motorized store mannequin in a shop window.  Yes. this movie appeals to everyone and is still funny.  And this movie is where the song ""Silver Bells"" first appeared.  A great supporting cast also adds to the appeal of this classic Christmas movie.  Written by Damon Runyon, the script lets Hope shine without descending into complete silliness and slap-stick.  One of my favorite Holiday Movies.",1513468800,,778,4.553956834532374

813321,5,6304204906,"It seems an odd match: Damon Runyon, Christmas, and Bob Hope. Still, this is one of the best comedy vehicles Hope ever had, and Shout!, current owner of the film's distribution license, has given good little girls and boys, and everyone else, a cleaned-up print with excellent audio. Everything comes together here. The script is by Edmund Hartmann and Frank Tashlin, who also collaborated on ""The Paleface"" (1948) and, with others, on classic Hope-Crosby Road pictures and ""Son of Paleface"" (1952). Edith Head did the costuming, which means the con men are as well dressed as ""the dolls."" Victor Young (""Around the World in Eighty Days"") covers the score. Paramount's house composers Jay Evans and Ray Livingston offer three songs, the best and most enduring of which is ""Silver Bells,"" introduced here by Hope and his leading lady (reputedly his offscreen squeeze) Marilyn Maxwell. The rest of the cast is also perfect: Jane Darwell, the elder and most endearing doll; Lloyd Nolan and Fred Clark as the chief racketeers; William Frawley as Hope's primary henchman; and a moaning cow, whose name, we learn, is Crosby. If you're a Runyon purist, you may be disappointed, though there's enough of his spirit here to grease the plot and provide some of the funniest sight gags. The show belongs to Hope, who delivers one-liners with his impeccable timing. A great change of pace for the holidays, entertaining any time of year.",1506729600,2,1425,4.991596638655462
813322,2,6304204906,"Okay - so it wasn't as bad slapstick as most of Bob Hope's videos...but the racism and ethnic stereotypes made it a huge turn-off for me.  Yes, I know; what else do you expect coming out of that era?!?!",1506038400,,202,4.17948717948718

813324,4,6304204906,"If the title isn't a tip-off that this is a Damon Runyon story, the rest of the nicknamed character roster ought to be a dead giveaway: Brainey Baxter, Oxford Charlie, Nellie Thursday, Moose Moran, Straight Flush Tony, Gloomy Willie, Sam the Surgeon, Little Louie, Singing Solly, and Goomba.

Runyon famously wrote about colorful characters he met on Broadway and at the racetracks in Floridaguys and dolls, racketeers and henchmen, horse trainers and grooms, bookies and touts, and just plain down-and-outs.

Like Pocketful of Miracles (1961)which was also inspired by a Runyon short storyThe Lemon Drop Kid is set around Christmas, a film in which the main character wavers between being a selfish Scrooge or an unselfish giver. Hes the only character who has any kind of arc at all; the rest are stock types or foils.

Like the Shirley Temple film Little Miss Marker and the Bob Hope remake, Sorrowful Jones (both based on another Runyon story), it revolves around a debt or a bet. In this case, The Lemon Drop Kid (Bob Hope) touts a horse to a woman holding $10K, and that horse loses. Whats worse, the woman turns out to be the girlfriend of notorious racketeer Moose Moran (Fred Clark).

Naturally, Moose wants his money back, and he gives the Lemon Drop Kid until Christmas to settle the score . . . or else. So the Kid goes to New York and looks up his old girlfriend Brainey Baxter (Marilyn Maxwell) and also racketeer Oxford Charlie (Lloyd Nolan) to see if he can get a loan. When that falls through, the Lemon Drop Kid gets a brainy idea of his own: seeing a Salvation Army bell-ringer dressed as Santa, the Kid decides to ring a bell in a Santa Suit with a kettle and a sign that reads Save a Life. Meaning, his own.

When the Kid is arrested and realizes he needs a legitimate charity to work that scam, he starts the Nellie Thursday Home for Old Dolls and gets every known Broadway hustler to help him raise money, because don't they all love Nellie? So did audiences of the time. Nellie was played by Jane Darwell, who won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her performance as Ma Joad in The Grapes of Wrath and might be familiar to a later generation as the Feed the Birds woman in Mary Poppins.

Will the Kid come through for Nellie? Will he end up at the bottom of the East River? Will he complete the scam, repay the money and beat it back to Florida? Viewers don't really know, and were not so sure the Kid does either. All we know is that the Kids desperate plan involves dressing like a little old lady.

Directors Sidney Lanfield and Frank Tashlin don't give Hope the same long leash to improvise and mug for the cameras as he normally has, but thats in keeping with the spirit and tone of the Damon Runyon tales. The closest the film gets to bad schtick or goofy slapstick is when we see Sam the Surgeon (Harry Bellaver), Morans persuader, in full operating-room dress as he tries to extract a dime that someone was holding out. Or when Hope acquires his dress from a store window display in full view of a crowd . . . and a beat cop.

Small children may need to shake a few presents while they watch, but if older children can get past the black and white theres a lot here to entertain. And fans of I Love Lucy will enjoy seeing William Frawley, who played Fred Mertz, as Broadway hustler Gloomy Willie. Most of the humor is situationala clever line here, or a wry remark there. But theres something in The Lemon Drop Kid thats endearing enough to make it a nice alternative to the usual Christmas movies that families watch together every holiday season. After all, its the film that introduced the song Silver Bells.",1500854400,5,3645,4.512121212121212

813516,3,6304204906,"The Lemon Drop Kid (Kino Lorber) Stars Bob Hope as Sidney Milburn, (aka The Lemon Drop Kid, named so because of his addiction to candy), a con man who offers a friendly sure thing horse tip to the girlfriend of mobster Moose Moran (Fred Clark) at the race track. When the horse loses and Mooses original pick wins, Moose gives Sidney until Christmas to pay back the $10,000 he lost or his henchman, Sam the Surgeon (Harry Believer), will open up Sidney after Christmas.

To pay back the money he owes Moose, Sidney enlists some pals to hit the street corners of New York dressed as Santa Claus accepting donations for a phony elderly ladies home on Long Island. But soon after, gangster Oxford Charlie (Lloyd Nolan) tries to muscle in on Sidneys scam.

As Bob Hope comedies go, this is one of the weakest. The gags simply don't land and even seem forced. An uninspiring screenplay doesnt give Hope much to work with, and he resorts to dressing up as Santa Claus and as an elderly woman, taking a page from the Milton Berle Playbook. Hope does machine gun a bunch of one-liners, but they lack the zip and zing so prevalent in the Road pictures.

Based on a Damon Runyon story, The Lemon Drop Kid co-stars Marilyn Maxwell, Jane Darwell, William Frawley, and Side Melton. The movie introduced the hit Christmas song Silver Bells, which is featured in a big production number. Hope sang the song every year on his annual Christmas TV shows, usually as a duet with his lead female guest star.

Many supporting actors you will recognize from other movies and shows of the 40's and 50's.  Nice to have these classic comedies where jokes were PG-rated and funny.,1482364800,,477,4.576470588235294

I'm old enough to remember watching Bob Hope holiday specials and movies on TV growing up and back in the 60's and 70's they seemed funny at the time.  Never saw ""The Lemon Drop Kid"" however but an internet list recently listed it in the top 25 Christmas movies so decided to give it a shot.  Despite the color cover art on the disc box this is a black & white show which is fine if that's what you're expecting.  The movie itself is pretty hokey; Hope's performance in the title role of a small-time hustler displays his usual schtick and co-stars are fine enough but the script is fairly lame and most of the jokes don't stand up in 2015.

814789,5,6304204906,"This, I think, is one of the overlooked gems in the ongoing parade of Holiday Movie. It's got an easy going plot, even some vintage eye candy plus some good songs -- including the introduction of the now Christmas classic -- ""Silver Bells."" The Runyonesque slant, ala ""Guys and Dolls"", is a nice touch, it sets it apart from other feel good movies of the season. It's sort of like an old time NY wisecrack that has heart to it. It's one of my favorites and I have no problem giving it 5 stars. True, Hope is not the crooner Der Bingle is but he does a nice job putting the song over and his characterizations are enjoyable to watch.
  In short, if you'd like a slice of vintage Holiday cheer complete with some funny moments, ""tongue-in-cheek"" takes on likeable con men and a happy ending to boot, check this out. Be warned though, it is a movie with good old fashioned sentiment -- anything resembling cynicism is played very lightly. So if you want a movie with an ""edge"" to it, this ain't it. I mean, the thing was shot it black and white so it's not exactly modern -- but then again, that's what I like about it.",1420070400,7,1116,4.309523809523809

Great supporting cast of vintage actors, especially Jane Darwell as Nellie Thursday (best known as Ma Joad in The Grapes of Wrath). I laughed out loud a lot, and the idea of a scam that converts a casino into a ""Home for Old Dolls"" is just too outlandish to miss. You've never seen someone duck being demolished by a mobster with such humor and wit as Hope's portrayal of the Lemon Drop Kid. There's a subtle pun in the use of Silver Bells in this film.

815360,4,6304204906,"Based on a Damon Runyon story, a man bumps into a gangster's moll and causes the gangster to accidentally lose many thousands of dollars in a racetrack bet.  The gangster kidnaps the man and gives him an ultimatum-find a way to replace his losses, or face terrible consequences.  As it is not far from Christmas, the man tries to gain the money by ringing a bell...but he has no charity license.  His next plan is to reopen a gangster's secret gambling facility, the funds which allegedly are supposed to go to charity.  Trouble is, another gangster gets wind of everything and muscles in on the man.

Bob Hope did make a number of terrible movies, but this is not one of them.  He gives a good performance, the tension does not flag, and the Christmas standard ""Silver Bells"" was, in fact, sung for the very first time by Hope in this movie.  Definitely recommended for Christmas viewing, or anytime.",1393891200,,901,4.628930817610063

Poor execution

815892,5,6304204906,"Growing up in Southern California in the 70's afforded one the chance to watch KTLA's Family Film Festival with the great Tom Hattan, a studied and charismatic fan of cinema who turned on a new generation to the sort of great American films that could keep you inside on a sunny day. One of the films that he ensured came round every year was The Lemon Drop Kid.

True to its roots, this film captures all the humor, creativity, and uniqueness of the personalities found in Damon Runyon's classic stories and marries it to Hope's inimitable, over-confident, yet hapless style. The result, as one might expect, couldn't be more appealing.

Marilyn Maxwell, Hope's on screen love interest, is also wonderful as Brainy Baxter. Her comic timing and serene voice make it all too easy for viewers to fall for her performances. And if the chemistry between herself and Hope seems genuine... well, that's because it is. Hope and Maxwell were a well-known item in Hollywood during this period. She was often referred to as Mrs. Bob Hope, despite the fact that Bob was already married at the time.

There is a modest charm to the Kid's redemption in this film which is perfect for the holidays and perfect for family. The first performance of the well known classic, Silver Bells, is also not to be missed. And as far as the Christmas pantheon of classic films is concerned, this ranks up there with heavyweights such as It's a Wonderful Life and Christmas Story.",1387152000,3,1453,4.735177865612648

The Bishops Wife, and its ethnic counterpart The preachers Wife, It's a wonderful life, Miracle on 34th street, the many incarnations of A Christmas Carol etc. I have all of these and they are all my favorites. The Lemon Drop Kid is one which has been overlooked by many over the years. All of the stories have the same heart changing story line and for the most part done with an air of necessary seriousness. This movie does so with a touch of comedy but still reminds of our need for the giving and receiving of the milk of human kindness and that a heart can be changed. The acting and comedy are typical Bob Hope. The story and plot line is pretty much formulaic, with no real surprises. Just a simple heartwarming Christmas time movie which should be seen and just enjoyed.",1386979200,,888,4.487654320987654

Not to be a spoiler, I will just say that there is a lot of cynicism (for example, Silver Bells here is a feel-good marketing song designed to get people to open their wallets to the crooked Santas) but also a fair amount of heart. All the acting is great and it is fun to see Fred from I Love Lucy as well as Auntie Em from Wizard of Oz in key roles.

816410,4,6304204906,"This won't be an extensive review, just some thoughts.  I never saw ""The Lemon Drop Kid"" in its entirety before and considering how I sat through ""Holiday"" and others, this is one of the funner and funnier holiday films to come from the classic 1940s.  Bob Hope plays a horse hustler who in his hustling disses a mob boss.

To avoid being a corpse for Christmas, he makes up a scheme to create an old folks (""Old Dolls"") home and with a legal license to collect, gets a bunch of his gang to dress as Santas and collect from shoppers.  He did not expect to get a soft spot for the dolls nor that the $10,000 he owes would end up where it does!

Co-stars Marilyn Maxwell as the love interest; in real life Hope did have an affair with her, per Wiki.  Interesting.  I love their chemistry as they sing ""Silver Bells,"" the first film to release this Christmas classic.

Overall, fun if a bit dated film of gangsters, Christmas and some classy cars!",1356652800,2,944,4.354285714285714

This is not a so sad everything is unfair and we need to convince mankind that Santa is real kind of movie.  It is just good, clean, plain old enjoyable entertainment.

Plus, the story is just funny and touching, as well.  Jane Darwell, one of my very favorite character actresses of that era, is also prominently featured here and does her usual stellar job as one of the ""old broads"" Bob is trying to find a home for as part of his scam.  There are some touches of nostalgia here and there (after all, this is a Christmas movie), but it is very reminiscent of the old Damon Runyon stories about New York and is something the whole family can watch together for some good laughs.",1355097600,,641,4.461538461538462

816569,3,6304204906,"The Lemon Drop Kid(released March/51)stars Bob Hope as Sidney Melbourne,Marilyn Maxwell as 'Brainy' Baxter,Lloyd Nolan as Oxford Charley,Jane Darwell as Nellie Thursday,Fred Clark as Moose Moran,William Frawley as Gloomy and many others. The movie's original release timing was not the greatest(three months after Christmas),but it did do decent box office. This film however,as much as this reviewer so desperately wanted to like it more,could not do so.
The story finds Hope as the Lemon Drop Kid,a hustler who left the Big Apple to come to Florida,due to some bad debts and one angry stood up girlfriend. He's at the racetrack touting horses and trying to even the odds of winning to his favour. When he convinces the moll of a visiting crime boss(Clark)to bet her two grand on a horse that does NOT pay off,he and the boss come to an understanding,of sorts. Clark forces Hope to come up with 10 grand(the amount he WOULD have won if Hope hadn't interfered)before Christmas. Hope flees to a cold New York City to meet up with his girlfriend,who he cons out of $10.00. Watching the sidewalk Santa's around town,he comes up with a plan to get his money by pretending he is collecting for a charity. But of course his plan goes south quickly and he is arrested and thrown in the clinker.
While in the jug he ""perfects""his plan re the sidewalk Santa's. When he gets out he plans to turn Clarks old gambling joint(sitting empty)into a home for old dolls,named after one of his best friends Nellie Thursday(Jane Darwell).He also makes sure he gets a proper permit to do so. However his ultimate scheme is to collect the money right up until his deadline,pay off Clark,then abscond with the rest. The only hitch being that all the old women will be tossed out in the street. Hopes girlfriend Maxwell bails him out and Hope is off and running with his scheme. It goes good for awhile until Maxwell's boss,Nolan,gets wind of the idea. He muscles in on Hope and takes his dough and the entire scheme to another location. Now Hope has to either cut bait and run or try and get his money back. He decides it's best to do the latter.
He disguises himself as an old doll and gets into Nolan's digs. When he gets his chance he tussles with Nolan,gets the money and runs. It is Christmas Eve and deadline time. Boss Clark arrives to get his money and Hope is waiting. Shortly after,Nolan arrives demanding his money back. Hope then opens up the hidden gambling tables as the police arrive to raid the place;on Hope's own tip. Clark is charged with operating an illegal gambling joint and Nolan is charged with fraudulently obtaining charity funds for his own use. The film ends as Hope and Maxwell embrace,and in walks a bawling cow.""Quiet Crosby"",Hope says. Fade to black.
The last remark about Bing was a public running joke the two had going with each other for years,on screen,on record and on radio. The film's plot meanders more than the Mississippi River,is humdrum,stop and go and as result most of Hope's jokes fall flat and are unfunny. It has an abundance of extraneous scenes which weigh things down. Scenes like him putting his money into a statue 's head outside,then them adding Maxwell into the mix and him trying to hide it from her. Or Hope's flight on a bicycle from Nolan and his men could have been cut as he rode away from the boy scout from whence he obtained said bike. But no,he had to flee into a hotel and some extra added padding beyond that. These and so many more scenes should have been paired or cut completely to give it a better pace. There is also terribly bad overdubbing throughout this picture from Hope,to alot of his costars,as the mouths obviously sometimes just don't match the words. Then there's the childish use of film-stop-reverse in the casino with the old dolls on the gambling tables. Finally there are two musical numbers done by Hope and Maxwell. In and of themselves they are well done,and who could forget that a Christmas anthem""Silver Bells"",was one of them. But with all the unnecessary padding going on,these numbers just slow the film down even more. In a p.s.,I have to say having Hope as a con man trying his best to pay off a debt is one thing,but to get it at the expense of  putting kind old women out in the winter cold,and his so called friends at that,doesn't make one apathetic with his character at all;even if it is Bob Hope. You are supposed to like him,not dislike him. His character therefore ends up also working against the film.
Veteran Darwell you will know as the bird lady in Mary Poppins. Frawley of course was on the cusp of becoming a household name on TV with I Love Lucy. Nolan would become more well known in the late 60s as the good doctor on the TV show Julia starring Diahann Carroll.
Technically the film is full frame,and I must say kudos go to Shout Factory for giving us the best print of this film I have ever seen. It has some slightly rough spots but overall it is clear and crisp,with great contrast. No extras are to be found.
All in all what I had ""Hope""-d would be a better seasonal offering from 1951,from one of my all time favourite performers,just doesn't cut the mustard on viewing. It is slow going with just too much added padding that weighs the film down. As a result Hope's usual wisecracking humour which works to a tee in say""Ghost Breakers"",mostly falls flat in this one.",1354665600,,5370,4.61128526645768

I remember having seen it a couple of times on television as a kid, but I never picked up a copy of the VHS tape and no DVD was available in recent years.  This DVD appears to have been made from a restored print, because, except for one brief episode of ""pixilation,"" the print is excellent.  I have to admit that the film was not quite as good as I remembered, though, and is certainly not in a class with Paleface, the Road movies, or other films Hope made in the 1940s and early 1950s.  Hope is very good, as he always was in films from this period, but the story -- particularly the dialog -- is a bit lacking.  Hope and his co-stars -- notably, Marilyn Maxwell, William Frawley (Fred Mertz!), and Lloyd Nolan -- deliver their lines well, but, unfortunately, the lines aren't as funny as they should be.  The weak dialog is particularly surprising because the usually reliable Frank Tashlin had a hand in writing the script.  The film does a good job of portraying Christmas in the New York of the 1950s (or, at any rate, the backstage Hollywood version of New York), although given that it is based on a Damon Runyon story, it might have been better if it had been set in the 1920s.  The film does have the bonus of having (I think) introduced the song ""Silver Bells.""  The DVD contains absolutely no extras, but is reasonably priced.

I found it several years ago for $4.99 in a bargain bin, went home and watched it, and immediately went back to the store to buy several more copies to give as gifts.

In this rapid-fire-dialogue movie based on a Damon Runyon story, we first see the Kid at a Florida race track, using a con on people to spread his chances of winning dough. After mistakenly duping a mobster's girlfriend (""is daddy angry?""), the Kid negotiates a 30-day window for him to drum up the money he owes. He flees to New York, where he hooks up with an ex-girlfriend (Marilyn Maxwell as Brainy Baxter) and an ""old doll"" (Jane Darwell as Nellie Thursday) being evicted from her home. After seeing all the money the corner Santas rake into their kettles with their bell-ringing, the Kid creates a charity for an Old Dolls Home, and gets some of his old cronies to help him with the fundraising. Of course, things go awry, but along the way, the movie is filled with laugh-out-loud scenes (I'm thinking of the passionate kiss in the garden while the Kid tries to replace a statue's head, and the entire last part of the film where the Kid goes undercover) and some very sweet scenes between the rough characters.

In this film, some of Hope's best scenes are where there is no dialogue, but only the comic timing genius of Hope.

To top it off, it has the best version ever of ""Silver Bells,"" and a lovely duet with Hope and Maxwell as they put the old dolls to bed with the song ""It Doesn't Cost a Dime to Dream."" You'll find yourself humming or singing it the next day.

The Lemon Drop Kid is reminiscent of Guys and Dolls, and Sorrowful Jones, both also inspired by Damon Runyon's storeis.",1281916800,2,1774,4.479876160990712

I wouldn't rate it as high as My Favorite Brunette or The Cat & the Canary, but it is entertaining throughout the film.  There were a couple spots in which the writers had an opportunity to do some clever things with the plot, but instead seemed to go the simpler route.  That's not always a bad thing, especially in a comedy.  But in this case I feel like the overall plot was very good and they should have thought through some of the details a bit more, and they may have had a classic on their hands.  Instead they have a ""good"" movie.  As usual, Bob Hope's delivery and great timing carry the film, but there's plenty here to see by various cast members as all the actors do a fine job.

817036,4,6304204906,"A WONDERFUL lost, (at least to me) Christmas movie that will now be firmly established on my list of must see Holiday films.

I had not seen this film before and did not know it was a Christmas film (probably because of the title) but it is a warm and hilarious Bob Hope romp and a veritable who's who of great character actors including Lloyd Nolan, Fred Clark, Sid Melton, Jay C. Flippen, Jane Darwell (the Feed The Bird's Lady from Mary Poppins), Tor Johnson (the hulking giant from Plan 9 From Outer Space) and even dear old Fred Mertz or William Frawley who helps introduce the old holiday standard ""Silver Bells"". And that's just the tip of the iceberg!

The writing is great. The direction top notch and the laughs just keep on coming. I suggest you put ""The Lemon Drop Kid"" right at the top of your holiday film list. And why wait until Christmas? Put it in your cue now and celebrate Christmas at the height of this blistering summer!",1155513600,15,943,4.445086705202312

817237,3,6304204906,"""The Lemon Drop Kid"" is simply one of Bob Hope's best films. Although I don't think many people look to it when they talk about Hope, and that's a shame.

 Based on a story by Damon Runyon, this version is a remake of a 1934 version, which starred Lee Tracy (some of you may recall his performance as Jean Harlow's agent in ""Bombshell""). This time around though Hope plays the ""kid"" who happens to be somewhat of a con man who hangs out a lot at the race track. Hope's angle is he walks around the track giving phony tips to various people hoping if they win they'll share their winnings with him for his service. Of course in reality Hope doesn't know the first thing about what he's talking about and this leads him into trouble when he gives a pretty girl some more of his phony advice. What Hope doesn't realize is that the girl was placing a bet for a famous gangster, Moose Moran (Fred Clark). When Hope's horse loses the race Moran demands Hope pays him back or Moran will make sure Hope never shows up at the race track again. In fact if Moran has his way Hope will never show up anywhere again! But Hope being the con man he is manages to slime his way into talking Moran into giving him some extra time to pay back the debt. Moran agrees and gives Hope until Christmas Eve, 17 days.

 What follows though is great Bob Hope comedy. I truly believe Hope gets in some of his best one-liners. His performance here is just as good as ones given in ""My Favorite Spy"", ""Casanova's Big Night"" (my favorite Hope movie), or any of the road pictures.

 Here in the Runyon character Hope manages to find a character that takes advantage of his winderful gift for delivering lines. Hope, in my opinion, is only rivaled by Groucho Marx for king of the one-liners. Runyon's characters usually speak very fast and are quicked witted. Hope has always had a breezy attitude when delivering his lines. It just seems to be as natural as air to him. This makes him believeable as the character.

 The movie is also timely to watch because of the holiday season, to be honest that is why I'm reviewing the film. Not so much because of my admiration for Bob Hope. The song ""Silver Bells"" was written for the movie.

 Marilyn Maxwell co-stars as ""Brainy"" Baxter, Hope's girlfriend and Lloyd Nolan plays Oxford Charlie, a gangster who gives Hope more worries. And William Frawley has a bit part, he also appeared in the 1934 film.

 Bottom-line: One of Bob Hope's best films. Has a lot of great lines and moves along pretty quickly.",1133654400,6,2517,4.436008676789588
817238,5,6304204906,"I find no end of humor with Bob Hope wanting to open a home for ""old dolls"", over the hill chorus girls. The Damon Runyon characters are well presented by director Sidney Lanfield. Like previous reviewers there's not much more to say, except that I agree that this is the film I watch at the holiday season, along with ""It's a Wonderful Life"".The wonderful song, ""Silver Bells"", is sung by Hope and Marilyn Maxwell, and the moment is appropriate. All of the supporting characters are wonderful; it's always great to see Jane Darwell chew up the scenery. I love this film a lot, and wish more people kmew about it.  ""Silver Bells"" was not nominated for Best Song. (Best song that year was ""Baby, It's Cold Outside"", which is not really a song, but a duet) The film itself received no Oscar nominations.

Kid goes to New York to see his girl played ny Marilyn Maxwell and to cook up a scheme to collect money for a bogus home for old ladies to pay off his debt.
he enlists local crooks and con men to dress up as Santas and collect money on steet corners for the phony charity.
Hope is at his best as the fast-talking and wise cracking Lemon Drop Kid.  The movie is notable for Hope and Maxwell's singing Silver Bells, which would become a staple of Hopes annual Christmas specials.

817241,4,6304204906,"I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this lesser-known Bob Hope Christmas film. Bob Hope plays a shifty race track con man who finds himself with only the few remaining weeks to Christmas to procure the $10,000 he accidentally scammed a mobster out of. The Lemon Drop Kid flees to New York where he rounds up his old friends to help him in a scheme that involves a shelter for old ladies and a lot of sidewalk Santa Clauses.
Even when he was playing a lout, Hope was still somehow sweet and loveable. No matter how dirty his deeds, he never crosses a line that you can't forgive, and he always redeems himself in the end.
The disc,as was to be expected, was pretty barebones. Unfortuntely, not a lot of effort is put into the releases of these older films unless they're universally-recognized classics like ""Casablanca"".

And ""The Lemon Drop Kid"" is pure Hope at the top of his comedic game, surrounded by a five-star cast including Jane Darwell, Fred Clark and William Frawley (who later gained his own icon status as Fred Mertz on ""I Love Lucy""). Adding to its luster, Hope introduced the Christmas classic, ""Silver Bells"", in the film.

817243,5,6304204906,"This review is for the movie only, not the DVD quality.
Bob Hope portrays a lemon drop eating race track hustler who hustles a local crime boss out of $10,000.  Hope is given until Christmas to get the money together.  Hope goes to NYC and cons his girlfriend, friends and local thugs into dressing up in Santa suits and collecting money for a senior citizens home for ""old dolls.""  Hope intends to make off with the donations and pay off his debt to the crime boss.  However,  a NYC crime boss figures out what Hope is up to and blows the whistle on Hope and takes over the Santa donation scheme himself.  Hope then redeems himself by entraping the two crime bosses, making sure the senior citizen home gets the donations and he gets his girl back.  It would seem that Hope's character has finally learned the Christmas message, that it is better to give than to receive.
This is probably my favorite Bob Hope film.  He is excellent as a scheming hustler type.  It seems to come natural to him.  The film makes great use of character actors from the 30,s 40's and 50's in the films various supporting roles.  Marilyn Maxwell is a real treat to look at and has great chemistry with Hope.  The song Silver Bells is beautiful and fits the film perfectly.  I think my favorite scene is where Hope is dressed as an elderly woman trying to describe what he is knitting to the other elderly woman.  It was a mop that goes so well with his argyle scrub bucket.

The sound was muddy, with pops and clicks and occasional lipsync problems. The tape looked much better and, indeed, since we gave away our copy of the tape, I have reordered it.

At least that one didn't frame-skip in the middle of the dialogue like this DVD transfer does! Maybe someday this film will get the DVD treatment it so richly deserves.
