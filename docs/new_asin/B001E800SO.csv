8603767,2,B001E800SO,"For a $40 dvd entitled ""Fundamentals"", I was really expecting more. The coach is knowledgeable in what he's telling you, but the information is really incomplete for the very beginning lacrosse d-man. You'd have to buy a complete set to learn anything. I really wanted a dvd to show you how to train on/off the season, how to switch hands properly...fundamental things.

In hind-sight, I would've spent the money toward a lacrosse camp instead or a different dvd. The production value is good, and the company's customer service is excellent.

I wouldn't recommend this particular dvd, but if anyone out there can recommend a better one, I'd love to hear it!",1289952000,,658,4.918918918918919
