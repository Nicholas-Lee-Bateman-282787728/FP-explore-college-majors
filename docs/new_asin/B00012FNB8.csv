1966667,5,B00012FNB8,"this dvd is addictive because my wife and i could see the results right away. Our eyes are really clear and we are sure we look younger!!
Kundalini yoga is a lot different then other forms of yoga. You do things you have never done before and that actually keeps it interesting and fun.
Even though this dvd is designed to remove toxins, I feel like it still gives a total body workout(like the total tune up dvd which we alternate this with)and so we don't need to do any other workout that day.
The exercises don't seem especially difficult but I find myself perspiring alot which i guess is due to the toxins clearing out. I guess I am pretty toxic! And when Ravi says I may have a strange metallic taste during the breath of fire exercise I definitely know what he means. This kundalini workout with out a doubt does what it is supposed to! Afterwards I feel very clean and revitalized.  Each time I do it I feel like I get a little deeper into those layers of toxins.
It works alot on the liver which according to Ravi Singh is the only organ which can completely regenerate itself. This is good to know if you drink or smoke or even just take tylenol or any substance for that matter. The liver has to filter everything. According to Ravi , even if your diet is pure the air most of us breathe will have an adverse inmpact on the liver especially if you live in an urban evvironment like us. My wife wants to add that she feels that this dvd has had a good effect on her menstrual cycles too. Making them easier and more regular.
This workout has a warm up set and two 25 minute workouts. We do the whole thing at once since its only an hour but it can be broken up so you can do half in the morning and half at night.
Ravi gives a lot of encouragement to help you perform your best and Ana Brett is very inspirational to watch and follow.  Its a very unique and beautiful presentation and I would reccomend this dvd to everyone!",1071705600,46,1935,4.227027027027027
1966688,1,B00012FNB8,"I was very excited by the positive reviews and couldn't wait to try this dvd. I presently take a weekly yoga class though Kundalini yoga is new to me. I couldn't wait to try this dvd for the first time last night but I was so disappointed that I don't think I could ever stand to use this dvd again, or any dvd's by the two people, though I will be looking into other Kundalini yoga dvd's and classes. I will try to return this dvd, otherwise it was a complete waste of money.

Notes:
- No real demonstration or practice time set aside for proper breathing techniques. I was unsure if I was executing the breathing techniques properly and I tried to look at the yoga practitioner but I could not determine the proper technique, the breathing instruction was no more than a simple quick mention and nothing more. The dvd says that it is suitable for all levels but the failure to teach the breathing techniques is a big failure to me.

- The female yoga practitioner in the dvd is wearing the outfit in the dvd picture, she really is half naked in the dvd and her nipples are showing. I have taken a lot of yoga classes in all styles with many different teachers and they have never been so scantily dressed as the woman in this dvd. Personally, I feel that as a woman I am inundated with Hollywood and porn star like images of women and I was looking for an empowering mind-body workout that would be uplifting and simplistic. Furthermore, the insert to the dvd says you should cover your shoulders and she fails to do that so her clothing is not so that the users can see the moves and I don't need to see nipples to see what the movements are. This is just another Hollywood sex sells dvd aspect that completely ruined the yoga experience for me and I feel it is out of line with the empowering and healing direction that Kundalini yoga is about.

-The man on the dvd does not look healthy and vibrant to me, he is calm but in an out of it/spacey kind of way. That is not the kind of calm that I could admire and follow. I know the difference and these two lack authenticity that I know I can grow to love about Kundalini yoga.

I can not lighten up and purify when these two are leading, their presentation is toxic in itself. I will be looking for authentic empowering yoga. I think they should go back to their practice and rethink their presentation they are not doing yoga the service it deserves by presenting it in a sex sells quick fix all your problems dvd.

I never write reviews but this time this had to be said!!!",1393977600,3,2528,4.2914046121593294
1966689,5,B00012FNB8,"I really like this DVD and do feel 'clean' after the routine. It's one of Ravi and Ana's earlier videos, so yes, the setting and the music seem a tiny bit dated. BUT! That does not take away from the experience or the quality of the instructions. And it was good to finally see Ravi on screen! The DVD is part of my weekly rotation.",1367366400,4,332,4.123076923076923
1966690,5,B00012FNB8,"This is one of RaviAna's earlier practices, so the production quality is on the lower side; however, this is an amazing practice.  I have had some other detox DVDs but Yoga Cleanse has many different and unique exercises.  Several years ago I had a severe sinus infection.  There were times I would get up in the middle of the night and have trouble breathing because my sinuses were so clogged.  Nothing seemed to help and it was really dragging on.  I decided to try Yoga Cleanse, and around the middle portion of the practice, I could feel my head warming up and my sinuses started to drain.  After that, my sinus infection cleared up rapidly.  This is a must-have gem in one's Kundalini collection.",1360281600,6,702,4.612903225806452
1966691,5,B00012FNB8,"Another shout out to the brilliant Ravianna duo! I have been doing this DVD 3 or 4 times per week (never complete program) and I have lost 8 pounds! I have also added beets to my juicing regimen. I have so much more energy in the morning now, it's amazing. Thank you AGAIN to Ravi and Anna!",1354492800,6,290,4.105263157894737
1966692,5,B00012FNB8,Ana & Ravi are the only DVD's I use for Yoga.  This is my fourth one from their collection and it's a tie for my favorite. My other favorite is Hip Bliss.,1353283200,,154,3.8125
1966693,5,B00012FNB8,"I discovered Kundalini Yoga about 3 months ago, and Raviana DVD's are by far my favorite. This older DVD is also amongst my favorites with its primitive studio, primitive lighting and bad sound. There is something magical about it, so go beyond all the flaws and let it work for you (LOL, I thought EMS was visiting my neighbor again the first couple times I did it until I realized the sirens were on the soundtrack...)

After 40+ years of not exactly living a healthy lifestyle, I got on the straight and narrow and changed my ways, however am concerned about the damage I may have done. I'm not entirely convinced fasting and juice cleanses and the like are entirely healthy either, and this seems to be a good way of cleansing the body and mind, at least psychologically, without causing further harm to one's self. I do this, and always feel a little ill afterwards for a bit like it has had a detox effect. I made sure to drink a lot of fluids to flush the garbage out, and I feel better. Much better. I don't know, this may be all in my mind, but you know what? I'm okay with that! I feel like I've done something valuable and healthy for myself.

Before purchasing these DVD's, I read a lot of reviews and also purchased DVD's by Maya Feinnes & Gurmukh. I didn't care for the other DVD's. I noted a lot of comments about Ana's attire. As I am also into physical fitness, I appreciate the fact that I can see what muscles she is using, or conversely relaxing, in a pose so that I can accurately attempt to copy it. I could not do this with the other DVD's due to the loose fitting clothing or long flowing garments. Also, to me, Kundalini Yoga is about turning inward and focusing on me for a couple of hours a week, not worrying about what someone is wearing. My biggest concern with the Raviana DVD's has been where do I get one of those furry rugs :-)",1345075200,15,1861,4.314285714285714
1966694,5,B00012FNB8,"I am a newcomer to the school of Kundalini Yoga.  A fellow fitness enthusiast gave me my first RaviAna DVD, ""Fat Free Yoga - Lose Weight & Feel Great"" approximately a year ago.  I was skeptical about it because I'd heard Kundalini is so different from the traditional schools of hatha and flow yoga I enjoy regularly.  But, having an open mind I popped that first DVD in - and became immediately hooked.

In the year since, I've accumulated nine more of Ravi and Ana's DVDs, including Yoga Cleanse.  Lately I have been enjoying the routines on this DVD more and more.  As my Kundalini practice has grown, the exercises have become easier for me to do and now I feel the full benefits of these routines.

This video has been reviewed in detail; I will focus on what it does for me.  In a nutshell:  I feel wonderful after completing a routine.  Typically I will do the warmup then choose either one of the two primary sections - Love Your Liver or Tear Out the Toxins, then proceed to the remainder of the DVD.  In this way I can get in a shorter routine and still have time for the other activities I enjoy.  After I get up and begin to go about my day, I have the most serene feeling, I'm breathing deeply and well, have a smile on my face and I just feel good all over.

There have been some criticisms about this DVD having poor production/being filmed in a warehouse, or a weird beam of light over Ana.  I really don't notice it.  I prefer the spare backgrounds of the older RaviAnas, I find it more meditative.  Besides my eyes are closed for most of it.  I really like seeing Ravi at the beginning and the end, too.  My only problem with this DVD was that at first, the breathing exercises through the curled tongue were very hard for me to sustain.  After getting Yoga House Calls and finding this type of breathing again in the Anti-Arthritis segment, suddenly it clicked.  I keep a water bottle near me and take a quick sip to help with the dryness, then move on.  After a few sessions this type of breathing does become easier.  I don't know how it works, but it does!!!  Thank you Ravi and Ana",1343174400,5,2104,4.324808184143222
1966695,5,B00012FNB8,"I reckon these two created a fabulous symbiosis! His voice guides you beautifully through all the moves and if you are not too sure you can see Ana showing you the asanas. I love their Kundalini Yoga, because it allows you your own pace, accommodates for your level ( I practiced Iyingar and Astanga Yoga for 9 years intensively- was a normal 38 year old when I started..) and leaves you with a feeling that you did something really beautiful, healthy and nourishing.. They are WONDERFUL!",1314144000,3,488,4.686046511627907
1966696,2,B00012FNB8,"Can anyone explain to me how panting with your mouth open can clear out toxins? Seriously, I was all excited about this DVD because I'm interested in cleansing my liver but I have to admit I was a bit disappointed. By the third day I was wondering if I was doing more harm than good. It's the parts where you do breath of fire with a curled tongue extended that I have an issue with particularly. I'm no expert but I remember from high school Biology that it was better to breathe through your nose because your nostrils can filter out some impurities from the air. Now, if you are sucking in all this breath through your mouth, aren't you just inhaling loads of dust particles directly into your body?",1310860800,,702,4.407692307692308

1966698,5,B00012FNB8,"Yoga Cleanse has two sets both of which are work to detox the liver. They are also great workouts as well. This one doesn't have the bells and whistles of some of the later Ana & Ravi titles, but the magic is still there. Amazing stuff!",1301961600,6,236,4.1521739130434785
1966699,2,B00012FNB8,"OK, I'm not that new to Kundalini.  I really enjoy their Kundalin Yoga-For Beginners and Beyond.  But this was done so poorly.  The quality of the video production is horrible (1 star); there is even misspells in the closing credits - assistant, not asistant.  The clothing is a poor choice; don't need to see that much nipple.  The music was bad and narration was equally bad.  The actual routines itself was marginal (a 3 star) but definitely not my favorite.  What's with the ""grace is given, but is also to be earned,"" seriously?!  What kind of spiritual teaching is that?!  Grace is never earned, but freely given by God.  I almost wish I hadn't bought it.  Will I do it again; maybe.  But this one will go on the bottom of my DVD stack.",1295568000,7,742,4.455223880597015
1966700,5,B00012FNB8,"I love this DVD because it helps to de-tox the liver and is a really great total workout. Since I've been doing the ravi and ana dvd's (I now have all of them), I've been paying a lot of attention to things I used to take for granted. One thing I've learned is that our livers have to filter toxins which we are always taking in from the environment as well as non-organic foods, etc. I love the idea that they made a DVD which focuses on the liver. Everyone, especially if you live in a city, should do this workout on a regular basis (and also think about going on a cleansing fast once in a while). Ravi & Ana's genius is that they can make dvd's which work on so many levels at once: detoxing, body sculpting, strengthening, and more!",1279670400,6,738,4.204225352112676
1966701,3,B00012FNB8,"I loved Dance with the Chakras, Yoga Bliss Hips & Fat Free Yoga, so I felt condifent that Yoga Cleanse would be a nice addition in my collection. However, the quality of the production is quite bad for this one, the image was not always clear, the music not as good than in the other dvds and the poses weren't as challenging and energizing. I would first check some of their other dvds first before opting for this one.",1271548800,4,420,4.329113924050633
1966702,5,B00012FNB8,"This is my fourth dvd by Ana and Ravi and I love it. I aim to alternate the four dvds yet this one keeps slipping in on extra days because it's so beautiful for your body. It's easy, cleansing and gives you such a great feeling. It's like having a colonic without the intrusion or discomfort. I love it. I've never known such an easy way to detoxify your liver and feel phenomenal doing it. Great stuff. :)",1270684800,7,406,4.217948717948718
1966703,5,B00012FNB8,"a good video, though it's a little older, you will feel really purified afterwards. in the video you can actually see ravi in the beginning and in the end. the acoustic in the newer videos is better, but this video is still one of the best (next to fat free yoga).
i really can recommend it. it's really good for people who suffer from indigestion...",1264032000,6,350,4.4
1966704,5,B00012FNB8,"...which is a good thing. Some of the exercises seem strange the first time around, but Ravi is explaining what each one is for as you do it, and that helps keep you motivated!

It's not a physically strenuous workout, so if you're hungover and feel like you need to workout and cleanse (but aren't up to a hard physical challenge) this would be great.

If you have roommates or live with someone you might feel a little weird doing this one in front of them--there are a lot of unusual (think: tongue sticking out) breathing techniques that accompany the exercises.

But really the bottom line is how cleansed/energized you feel at the end of the workout, and for that it's fantastic! Be sure to drink lots of water afterward to flush out all the toxins you ripped from your system!",1255824000,5,783,4.539007092198582
1966705,5,B00012FNB8,"Owning more that a dozen Ravi and Ana DVDs, I found this one to be quite the little treasure.  It was filmed in 2003 and it is a different experience that the newer DVDs.  At the beginning of the DVD, you actually see Ravi and he introduces Ana (she waves).  It's extremely charming!

As far as the actual yoga workout - it is very powerful.  Be prepared to truly lose weight, feel clear-headed and energetic.  I have been doing this DVD daily for 3 weeks now and have so much energy one of my closest friends told me that my 24 hours day grew to a 36 hours day.",1244160000,19,562,4.110091743119266

This particular DVD -- you can tell -- is not as sophisticated and looks predated. HOWEVER, the warmups and liver detox workouts are awesome. Don't let the predated look of the DVD discourage you, you are still getting what you need out of this DVD!! I would recommend this to anyone today. The first time I did the entire workout, I was full of energy for the entire day.",1241654400,9,546,4.362745098039215
1966707,5,B00012FNB8,"I'm a big fan of Ravi Anna dvds. Eversince I've started doing their workouts, my extra pounds started to fall off without much effort. I've been diagnosed with pcos since I was a teenager and losing weight has always been a big problem for me. But with Ravi and Ana's workouts and a sensible diet plan I've been losing weight at a steady pace. This dvd is one of their early production but you won't notice it once you concentrate on the excercises. All I can say is thankyou to Ravi and Ana for their excellent collection of yoga workouts.",1237161600,8,540,4.41

1966720,5,B00012FNB8,"This workout gave me new access to the power of the liver and how to support it.

1966721,3,B00012FNB8,"I have 9 other Ravi Singh and Ana Brett Kundalini Yoga DVDs and love each of them.  I was very excited to get this DVD, but I don't know if I can even use it again; it was stressful going through it the first time.
  Each of the other DVDs is of the highest quality; the set bright, light, open and clear.  The instruction clear and peaceful in either Ana's sweet gentle voice, or Ravi's peaceful voice.  This vid is very different in unsettling ways.
  First, the ""studio"" is an open warehouse with glaring fluorescent lights.  These lights are diminished and during the actual class, there is a dark background with an odd spotlight in the back behind Ana.  It is sort of gloomy and eerie looking, which is enhanced by the background noise of sirens making you feel that this was taped in a bad area of town at night.  The spoken lesson by Ravi is not as smooth as usual and that wouldn't be bad, but the setting and mood have already changed the quality of the potential.  The musical background is also less than smooth - think of a cassette tape playing in the background that needs to be occasionally restarted because you got to the end of side one.
  The lesson is excellent, and I wish that instead of transferring this to DVD, they would have redone the DVD anew keeping the lesson, but changing the quality to that of their newer works.
  If it were not that I already practically worship these two people and I already know how wonderful their work is, this DVD may have prevented me from trying any of their others.  As it is, this particular DVD is sitting on my table with me glaring at it, unable to muster up enough to do it again.  Argh, I could ignore the visuals, because I've done enough that I don't need to watch it; but, I cannot get past the sirens in the background.

**  Well, I finally got back into it and am glad.  I still wouldn't suggest buying it as your first Raviana DVD, and I still don't like some of the visuals, still notice the sirens, but can ignore these things now.  The benefits of this DVD outweigh the distractions.",1226361600,28,2061,4.3569553805774275
1966722,4,B00012FNB8,"I really like this video.  I almost love it, but I don't quite love it because by the end I feel a little sick and like I want to curl up in a ball and sleep.  Maybe that is the whole point.  I personally like the DVD's that leave me feeling energized and good.  This one works my body and I feel like I've really accomplished something, but I don't feel ""healthy"" afterwards.  I would still highly recommed it though.",1219968000,7,418,4.175

Ravi and Ana don't change a thing later, still great, but with some enhancements.  Ana's makeup gets better, There is breathing in the voice over ot direct and inspire you., etc. Each successive DVD they put out is better still.  My favorites are, ""Warrior Workout"". The production quality is better yet, and it is a very challenging workout, as are ""Navel Power, and ""Ultimate Stretch"" I love them!  Then there is Fat Free Yoga"" (This is where the production quality is great, and the music is wonderful with each successive DVD), ""Beginners and Beyond"", ""A Journey Through the Chakras"" (A masterpiece), ""Bliss Hips"", ""Dance the Chakras"", ""Beauty Body"".

One thing I like about their approach is that it's very active and can be done by anyone. Above all, it gives results. For example, if I'm feeling fuzzy headed, out of sorts, or unwell, this just clears me right up.
One caution I've found is that if you have knee problems, modify the frogs pose and only bend your knees a bit.

1966727,5,B00012FNB8,"Over the past few months I have acquired a few of Ravi and Ana's dvds, and this one adds another great dimension and benefits of kundalini yoga.  Typical layout is a good warmup ( a must) and then 2x half an hour exercises.  Part I focuses on the liver and part II is more general but a greater workout of your toxins.  These exercises are not stretch exercises, which the total stretch dvd is an absolute must.  Regardless, I have noticed over the past few months working on these dvds that:
a) my energy level has risen (had noticed how much it had fallen since being directly affected by 9/11)
b) my liver yin was stagnant and hence my period has been very irratic and painful.  Now the flow has improved within a month.
c) stress has been a prominant component of my life in the past few months and the dvd has helped to calm my nerves and remove the toxin build-up.

I am busy person and try and do one of the dvds 3x a week with particular focus at the weekend.  The dvds also allow you to do a shorter version if you are pushed for time.  I am usually a runner by choice but these dvds have really been a much better alternative: you feel you have had an aeorbic workout, feel the sense of relaxation and less damage to my knees.  Believe me, I sweat through most of these exercises and I would consider myself to be in fairly good shape.

This could well be an great alternative to accupuncture that also works on the energy/meridian lines of the body; and release of toxin in your body without the use of medicines.  A natural detox program.",1184284800,27,1550,4.292096219931271
1966738,5,B00012FNB8,"I was diagnosed with hypoactive thyroid over a year ago and was put on medication. Once on the medication, if I ever missed a day, the next day would be a disaster. I would be completely exhausted.

I started Yoga Cleanse for my liver on new years day and immediatley felt like my thyroid improved. I actually had to miss two days of medication because my prescription ran out over the holidays and I still felt better then ever, I couldn't believe it. We then got Fat Free Yoga, because of the ""life is in your glands"" chapter"". We have other Ravi and Ana CD's, but these two are my favorites.

I knew my thyroid was improving because my pulse rate went from 44 to a more normal 64.

I have never written a review on amazon, and told my wife that if my blood work proved my thyroid levels improved I would write one. So here I am! My bloodwork is back and my doctor has completly taken me off my medication.. everything is normal!! There is no telling how long I've lived with a hypoactive thyroid, I now have more energy then ever!!!

Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!

P.S.  My father-in-law who is from India and has practiced yoga for most of his life is now a true believer in Kundalini Yoga, and believe me, he IS NOT easily impressed!!  He now incorporates Kundalini Yoga into his work out every other day.  A lot of the reviews mention that these DVD's are great for beginners.

1966739,4,B00012FNB8,"Although I tend to practice mostly hatha yoga, I have tried a couple of Ana and Ravi's newer DVDs and have liked them, and I thought it might be nice to add another Kundalini video to my collection.  In particular, I was hoping to find a practice that would leave me feeling energized plus would offer shorter workouts for when I have less time, and after wading through the reviews on Ana and Ravi's older workouts, I thought that Yoga Cleanse might fit the bill.  Yoga Cleanse is divided into three segments:  a 11.5 minute warm-up, an 18-minute ""Love Your Liver"" segment, and finally, a 25 minute ""Tear Out the Toxins"" segment.  The segments flow nicely into each other, but there is a brief pause between each section, and the menu also allows you to select them individually.  The first thing that I noticed when I began the workout is that the production quality is not quite as impressive as with Ana and Ravi's newer DVDs.  Ana is seated in the middle of a somewhat dim studio, and at the start of the practice, Ravi is seated off to the side.  Ravi remains on screen to lead Ana through the opening meditation (Om Namu Guru Dev Namu), but for the majority of the practice, the camera focuses on Ana alone.  Also different from the new practices is that Ravi alone provides the voiceover instruction; Ana does not speak at all throughout the workout.

As mentioned above, the warm-up begins with a chanting meditation and then moves into a series of moving stretches that includes stomach grinds, neck rolls, and cat/cow.  The final exercise incorporates Breath of Fire (BOF) while lying on your back with both your head and feet raised.  You then relax on your back for a few moments before rolling up to a seated position for the next segment, Love Your Liver.  In this section, you will be working to stimulate your liver function, and so you will repeatedly return to a position of lying on your left side, right leg raised in the air with hand clasping your left foot, and the perform BOF in this position.  Other exercises in this segment include transitioning from a seated to standing position without using your hands, bending over so that your torso is parallel to the floor and engaging in BOF, and twisting from side-to-side in a seated position while performing BOF through a curled tongue.  I found the final segment, Tear Out the Toxins, to be the most intense.  Virtually all of the exercises are dynamic movements (eg, vigorously moving your arms up and down, twisting from side to side), and you continue to perform BOF through a curved tongue, which I found tiring after awhile.  After 18 minutes of active practice, the last 5.5 minutes of this segment consist of a 2-minute singing meditation and then a 3.5-minute relaxation and final meditation (Ravi again appears on screen for the final few minutes).

When I tried this video for the first time, it was at the end of the long week, when I was feeling completely tired and worn out.  Afterward, I wasn't exactly rejuvenated, but I definitely felt better, and I wasn't nearly as fatigued as I had been.  Although Ravi and Ana aren't quite as polished here as they are in their more recent productions, they do a good job with this DVD, and I definitely look forward to using it regularly in the future.  Overall, I enjoyed this practice and would rate it 4 1/2 stars.",1173052800,68,3348,4.632825719120135
1966740,4,B00012FNB8,"When I first got this DVD and popped it in, I must admit I was a little taken back.  This is the first time I have been exposed to Kundalini yoga.  I am not new-agey at all, and Ravi's appearance and soft manner of speaking was suggestive of a cult member.  That, and his apparent penchant for speaking in rhymes.  And if he can't find a word to rhyme, he just repeats the first word.  That being said, I still find myself going back again and again, as I just find a deep release and relaxation at the end of the workout.  It does seem to clear my head and give a sense of balance to my body.  Ana Brett is great, and Ravi's wife(!)  She exudes a healthy natural beauty that is a great model for this type of yoga.  So the bottom line is, I do recommend this DVD, but caution people who are new-age wary to try and look past the soft, slow, speaking and incessant rhyming(trust me, after the 30th time, it gets disturbing when you find yourself chanting ""Floating there without a care, put yourself in Heaven's care!""  along with Ravi), and hang in there and reap the benefits.  You really will feel better.",1159228800,26,1108,4.253588516746412
1966741,5,B00012FNB8,"As another reviewer has said - this is yoga in the traditional sense - no down dogs - but so very interesting and fun!!

Effective too! : This DVD has really made a HUGE difference to me in terms of getting my energy going. I suffer from a sluggish liver which kept the weight on especially around that time of the month. It also had made me feel tired mentally and physically.

 I feel this cleanse has truly affected my health and energy levels and I felt results from the first time I did it.

This DVD  is a great addition to a workout program because it is different. The key to improving is not to do the same old thing day after day. It is moderately difficult, but it adds a little variety to my toning workouts.

Highly recommend!",1154908800,26,739,4.242857142857143
1966742,3,B00012FNB8,I did not really enjoy this DVD.  I also have the Fat Free Yoga Weight Loss video and I prefer that one.  I normally do Hatha Yoga and this is very different from that.  Many poses in this made me quite uncomfortable and the narrator said that they would.  I am sceptical and not quite sure that the poses actually do what they claim.,1154736000,6,334,4.171875
1966743,5,B00012FNB8,"I am a walking testament to this type of yoga. I began years ago with an old tape of Ravi Singh's (which I don't even think is available anymore) called Long Live You. I have long since worn it out. I now own all nine of Ana Brett & Ravi Singhs DVDs and continue this practice everday.

You would not believe how old I really am but my skin retains its youthful glow and elasticity and my posture and energy level is that of a much younger person. I feel at least half my age if not less. I would not even dare tell people my real age since they would laugh, thinking I am joking. Not that there is anything wrong with growing older - but if you can stay young gracefully, why not?",1145491200,37,681,4.044444444444444
1966744,5,B00012FNB8,"i recently bought Ana & Ravis fat free DVD series. i love them! i've done some Rodney Yee yoga before, and this is a refreshing change. i've never seen yoga done like this before. and the instructions are very clear.",1142899200,11,216,4.425
1966745,5,B00012FNB8,"I am a big fan of Ana & Ravi's tapes. I live in Shanghai, China. I would have loved to attend one of their retreats when I was still in the States.... too bad I didn't know about them until I came over here to China. I am hoping they will swing by this part of the world!!

Shanghai is quite polluted, so Ana & Ravi's Fat Free Yoga Cleanse has helped me deal with the toxins in the air. I do it every other day and it has made a difference in my energy levels. My subway stop has pushers -- people who push you in cause it is way too packed. I'm in the habit of breathing the air that thousands breathe out...prior to using the tape... I was always drained from the experience, but after doing it regularly, I was able to function more or less as if I was in a clean air environment.

 I am intrigued by how kundalini works.

Living in the East, I have gained an appreciation for these kinds of ancient & subtle sciences.",1141948800,44,921,4.043956043956044
1966746,5,B00012FNB8,"I have recently stumbled upon Kundalini Yoga.  I am loving it more and more every day.  I still do my Hatha and Astanga, but for getting my engery going and feeling that I am doing wonders for cleansing my body, you can not beat Kundalini Yoga.  Ravi has a wonderful soothing voice, not irritating nor condesending.  He explains exactly what the excersizes purpose is and Ana executes it for you to see how it should be done.  No downward dogs here, nor the usual poses you would expect.  This is yoga in the traditional sense of doing a set (Kriya) and then doing corpse pose and then doing another set.  This is meant to expand your mind and cleanse your organs and create flexability in your back and spine.  I have now purchased 2 other DVDs from Ravi and Ana and I am really, really, really happy with them.",1130889600,72,812,4.402684563758389
1966747,5,B00012FNB8,"I've practised hatha yoga on and off for nine years.  But this kundalini yoga is unlike anything I've done before.  The DVD totally deserves its high rating.

Ravi's instruction is very clear and encouraging during the active, strenuous exercises, and calming during the relaxation periods.  Ana is flawless and a pleasure to watch, but I find that I mainly concentrate on my own practice rather than watch her.

I felt really energised after the first session, and I look forward to doing it, alternating it with my hatha yoga sessions.  I bought this DVD along with Fat Free Yoga - Total Tune-Up.  It's also excellent.",1122249600,19,620,4.847619047619047
1966748,5,B00012FNB8,"As a Kundalini convert I didn't think I would find much variety for home practice DVDs or tapes out there, and part of what makes the live classes so fun and challenging is that they are different every day- you cannot adapt and anticipate the way you can with Hatha classes.  So I ordered two of Ravi Singh's DVDs and 2 Mantra Girl DVDs for a little variety.  I was deligthed to find that they are all fabulous and challenging in different ways.  This particular DVD focuses on liver cleansing and balancing, which was exactly what I was working on at the time since I am addressing old anger issues now.  It's the kind of class I was able to do right out of bed in the morning without feeling too jolted or shocked but I definitely felt invigorated and enlivened.  The breath work alone makes this a divine morning practice and I plan to use this several times per week as a detox wakeup call.  I particularly love the explanations Ravi gives while Ana is demonstrating- I find it empowering and helpful to know exactly what the benefits are of the movements and what areas you are addressing specifically.  If you like to learn about your body while you deepen your practice, you will love these DVDs.",1104796800,32,1204,4.495412844036697
1966749,5,B00012FNB8,"I have been doing yoga for about 2 years now and exploring different types.  The Kundalini Yoga DVDs with Ravi Singh & Ana Brett have stayed my favorites.  I saw The Yoga Cleanse featured on Amazon today and had to write to say how amazing it is. I alternate the Cleanse with Total Tune Up and doing them everyday I feel stretched, relaxed, energized and in the best health I can probably be in.

The Cleanse is a little over an hour long with warmups and 2 30 minute sets.  I like that these DVDs are challenging but not impossible. The workouts alternate vigorous movements with rest and there is an excellent chanting meditation on both DVDs. Kundlaini yogs is unlike any other workout there seems to be a wisdom built into the  the sequences that works all the aspects of the body.

I like Ravi And Anas style too...I hope they make many more DVDs. I highly recommend this one!!",1102032000,13,882,4.447204968944099
1966750,5,B00012FNB8,"This series of 3-DVDs are wonderful. They include individual segments for a quick workout or you can do them together for a longer practice. Ravi Singh has a very soothing voice. You work hard, then rest and meditate. This type of yoga might not be for everyone, but give Fat Free Yoga a try. Ravi Singh talks during the instruction and for 2 of the DVDs visual instruction is performed by Ana Brett (his current wife). The other DVD is demonstrated by Catherine Quinn.
Also, if you get a chance to attend one of Ravi Singh's / Ana Brett's workshop it's well worth the money. They came to Portland before I got their DVDs. It was a fun and rewarding workshop. I went out a bought all the DVDs after that and I'm practicing Kundalini Yoga along with my Hatha Yoga practice every day. Thanks Ravi!

1966751,5,B00012FNB8,These are not like other yoga DVDs. There is no logical sequence of static poses like other methods in which I have trained. Here the workout almost feels like playtime with its ballistic vigorous energetic movements.  There are times when you can recognize something close to a regular asana but nothings ever static. I love it! I realized that my other practice had been making me more tense. These workouts are a breath of fresh air. Ravi Singh is a very good teacher. Very intelligent with an inspiring flow of  talk. Ana Brett is an excellent model and moves like a dancer. It is a joy to have them in my living room! The emphasis is on the breathing. There is a warm-up and stretching on both tapes I have (yoga Cleanse and Total Tune Up). And meditation too. I also like how you can break things up though so far I haven't had to. I recommend these.,1078012800,9,856,4.4113924050632916
1966752,5,B00012FNB8,"I got 3 kundalini dvds for christmas: Fat Free, Total Tune Up, and Yoga Cleanse.  This is my introduction to kundalini yoga.  Its really different from the yogas I have done.  You are moving, flexing, and rotating, breathing all the while.  I like to alternate my workouts so I can do another one everyday.
The first thing I noticed was that even if I started my day tired or with a headache I would end it elated and pain free and with a good sense of self.  I think the secret is in the breathing not only for your body but for your psyche. I have always been a creative person but I was never able to just let myself be an artist.  It may be a coincidence, but since I have been doing these tapes I have been making art like I never could before and have the confidence to call myself an artist.
The instructors in these tapes are quite good.  Ravi Singh is like a fountain of wisdom and Ana Brett is like a nymph or a sprite. I get a kick out of watching her do yoga.
All the dvds can be broken into segments which I like.
I recommend these tapes very highly.",1074211200,21,1063,4.081730769230769
1966753,5,B00012FNB8,"I love Kundalini Yoga and I absolutely love this new series of Kundalini DVDs and Videos by Ravi Singh and Ana Brett called Fat Free Yoga. I have been practicing this form of Yoga for years and have always found Ravi Singh an excellent teacher and dedicated Yoga master. I own many of Ravi's earlier instructional videos and have always found them the perfect way to enhance and sharpen my Kundalini study. Ravi's teaming up with Ana Brett has brought these DVDs and Videos to an even higher level. Her form is amazing and precise. She is strong without looking like she lifts weights. My girlfriend and I practice along to one of the DVDs every morning when we get up. We usually rotate our workouts going through each of the 3 DVDs (1 a day) and then starting them over again. After we finish we are always charged and ready to face the day. We have both taken off weight due to our daily practice along to Ravi and Ana's instruction. Both my girlfriend and I have more energy and are sleeping better also.
For those new to this form of Yoga, Kundalini is different from other forms. It is an all body workout and therapeutic practice helping your organs as well as your muscles, skeletal structure and mental well being. It will actually help to remove toxins from your body, from organs like your liver and kidneys. Following the instruction on these DVDs and Videos give my girlfriend and I a total body workout.
I recommend the complete Fat Free Yoga series by Ravi Singh and Anna Brett without hesitation.",1073865600,20,1512,4.5625
1966754,5,B00012FNB8,"Review:  I have been a dancer in a ballet company for the past 10 years. My dance training led me to Iyengar and Power Yoga which seemed to be an extension of my dance training emphasizing precision and exactitude. It wasn't until I experienced Kundalini yoga that I realized what flexibility really is. Flexibility is freedom and the ability to let go, It's less about holding the pose and more about moving your energy (and that of course, moves your life!)
One important aspect of kundalini is its unique use of breathing. After doing either of these Ravi Singh/Ana Brett dvds I feel totally revitalized. I have finally been able to quit drinking coffee which has been my energy crutch for years.
Kundalini yoga has increased my confidence and artistry, my energy has opened up. Other people have commented on it. Its a wonderful feeling to open up and express myself in new ways!
Ana Brett, who demonstrates in these is obviously a dancer and inspiring to watch.
Ravi Singh gives good direction and motivation and valuable insights throughout.
I have been recommending these dvds to everyone - dancers and nondancers. Whoever you are - you will get benefits from this.",1073433600,16,1172,4.830845771144278
1966755,5,B00012FNB8,"I'm what you might call a typical American male. I drink beer on weekends. Sometimes more then I should. And even though I work out when I can I am not above indulging in a cheeseburger with fries once in awhile.
Lately I had been feeling bloated and nauseous alot. My girlfriend, who happens to be a yoga instructor, told me it was probably my liver and bought me the Yoga Cleanse tape. I have to say it is not what I expected. I though yoga was standing on your head and stretching and different poses. This was one of those things that I couldn't even imagine. Lots of breathing and novel exercises. I have to say it gets right to the point which I liked.
I have been doing this three times a week. If I don't have time to do the whole thing I just do 20 minutes which is enough to help turn my day around and put me on a good track.
I feel alot better. This tape has inspired me to get my act together.
I would recommend Yoga Cleanse to everyone sinceI don't think there is anyone who couldn't use a little detoxing.

I have other DVDs by Ravi and Ana (Fat free yoga/ Yoga beauty body/ Kundalini for beginners/ Dance the Chakras.) I have gifted their work to friends and family with hypothyroidism so that they may find relief.

This one is older and not as fancy as the newer productions. But the work speaks for itself. You just get into it -almost like a trance, or dancing, or just breathing. And you want to keep on doing yoga!

I have never been a fan of exercise. But I can actually stick with their programs. I have started doing yoga with my nine-year old daughter every night because of these DVDs. Pure bliss!

As far as results: I feel calmer, more energetic, more mindful. I am more flexible every day. I sleep well. I am, ehem, regular, which I have never ever been before in my life. And most importantly, I look forward to the hour of my yoga practice.",1490745600,,1015,4.303664921465969
