 We all know an extended trilogy will come out soon but we always get the shorter versions first.
 Really we want the longer cuts not the theatrical versions.

7006796,5,B00TFOKI7M,"Ever since the classic ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy ended, fans were clamoring for JRR Tolkien's ""The Hobbit"" to be adapted for film as well. After all, ""The Hobbit"" contains the seeds of the sequel trilogy's plot, so it made sense.

But instead of a straightforward adaptation of Bilbo Baggins' linear adventures, director Peter Jackson sets the stage for everything to come in his earlier movies. In addition to Bilbo finding the Ring, it is about the corruption of Middle-Earth as the Dark Lord returns to conquer everything. It has some notable flaws (primarily the contrived love story) and isn't quite as brilliant as the ""Rings"" trilogy, but the overall effect is a strong, epic story with a sublimely talented cast.

Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) is a nice boring gentlehobbit who has no interest in adventures. Then the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) descends on Bag End with thirteen dwarves. They are setting out for the lost city of Erebor, which the dragon Smaug stole many years ago, and now Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) wants to reclaim it. He especially wants the Arkenstone, a jewel that symbolizes kingship of the dwarves. Bilgo soon gets into the swing of the journey, despite vicious trolls, goblins, giants and an albino orc who literally wants Thorin's head (preferably separated from the rest of him).

But unknown to the dwarves, Bilbo has encountered a grotesque creature known as Gollum (Andy Serkis), and found a golden ring that gives invisibility. He uses this Ring -- and his newly acquired courage -- to survive the attacks by giant spiders of Mirkwood, and later avoid imprisonment by the deadly wood-elf King Thranduil (Lee Pace) and his son Legolas (Orlando Bloom).

When they reach Erebor, Bilbo is sent in alone to find the Arkenstone... and accidentally wakes Smaug, who immediately figures out what Bilbo is doing there, and goes on a burn-everything-to-the-ground rampage over the human city of Laketown. The only one who has a chance of stopping him is the stalwart archer Bard (Luke Evans) -- but even with Smaug gone, Thorin's paranoia and growing madness spark off a war between the dwarves, humans and their wood-elf allies.

While all this is going on, the wizard Radagast the Brown (Sylvester McCoy) warns Gandalf of something that moved into the old fortress of Dol Guldur, poisoning the forest and raising the dead. Gandalf believes that this may mean that Sauron is returning to his old power, and starts snooping in old mountain graves and the ruins of Dol Guldur. But what he finds is more horrifying than anyone in the White Council expected.

""The Hobbit Trilogy"" is not adapted ONLY from Tolkien's original novel, which is a very linear and simple story written in a childlike manner. Peter Jackson mined a lot of material from the ""Lord of the Rings'"" appendices, which give background information on Sauron's rise and the way that the White Council attacked him at Dol Guldur. Since Tolkien himself once considered rewriting ""The Hobbit"" to make it more closely tie in to ""Lord of the Rings,"" it's not that strange an idea.

And rather than a trilogy of movies, the ""Hobbit Trilogy"" feels more like a very long movie divided into thirds -- ""An Unexpected Journey"" is the setup and the beginning of the plot; ""The Desolation of Smaug"" expands the plot and cast, while building up to the grand finale; ""The Battle of Five Armies"" is the climax, when everything from the preceding films rushes together into one vast, glorious battle. In fact, the third movie's titular battle is so long and complicated that it dominates most of the movie.

And Jackson does a typically brilliant job evoking Middle-Earth's danger and majesty, sweeping us across glittering mountain citadels, murky forests and rotted fortresses. There are some absolutely stunning action scenes, such as Thorin stalking down a fallen, burning tree to fight his mortal enemy, or the sinuous, slithering Smaug filling the stone caverns with fire. Some of the fat could have been trimmed, but most of the stuff here is pretty solid.

The biggest problem? The whole subplot involving Tauriel. Don't get me wrong -- she's a good character and Evangeline Lilly does an excellent job, but the whole idea of her falling in love with resident hot dwarf Kili is painfully cheesy and goopy. Also, the whole character of Alfred. Why is he there?

Freeman is the perfect mix of fussiness and gutsiness as Bilbo, and we can see him slowly growing into his friendships with the Dwarves and earning their respect. It's too bad that he often is sidelined, since he IS the titular hobbit. Armitage is similarly brilliant as a butt-kicking dwarf prince who can be prickly and crabby, but Jackson shows audiences how much loss, pain and humiliation he has suffered over the years. By the third movie, Thorin is a tragic figure who is crumbling under the weight of his own hubris.

There are many familiar faces -- McKellen, the elegant Cate Blanchett and Hugo Weaving, a typically acrobatic Bloom as a younger and less experienced Legolas, and the sonorous-voiced Christopher Lee. Benedict Cumberbatch deserves special praise for giving a silken-voiced sadism to Smaug, and there are some amazing performances from Evans as a stalwart, noble man who fiercely loves his family; McCoy as a delightfully scatterbrained wizard who spends all his time with animals; and Pace as a sinuous, elegant elf king with a raw core of pain.

One thing to note is that this is the theatrical trilogy, not the extended director's cut that will presumably be out in a year or so. The difference is not as striking as it was in the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, but it does feel like the theatrical cut is missing some stuff.

It has some flaws like the cheesy love story, but ""The Hobbit Trilogy"" is a strong, majestic prequel to the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, mingling fantasy adventure with a sense of Shakespearean tragedy. Just don't expect a direct adaptation.",1424390400,45,5957,4.921314741035856

Jackson really went overboard and needs to have his ego checked. I can live with filmmakers removing parts of a book to get a movie made, I can't stand when they add entire sequences, characters and storylines however. I was thrilled when it was announced that they would be making a movie of the Hobbit. I read the whole book to my kids and then took them to the first movie. None of us liked it. Aside from the scene with Gollum the rest of it was quite frankly a bunch of CGI that didn't feel like anything like the book. The third movie was so terribly boring I fell asleep twice trying to watch it on Amazon.

The creative/artistic license of the producers was barely noticeable. ""Dungeons and Dragons"" lives. Good still triumphs over evil.

7006887,1,B00TFOKI7M,"One star because I couldn't choose no stars. I didn't buy this from Amazon as I refused to give Peter Jackson any money.
My brother got ""An Unexpected Party"" at a yard sale for $2 and I got the other two later for $1 each at yard sales. Between the two of us we paid $3 too much.
After seeing Jackson's evisceration of Tolkien's work in The Lord of The Rings I thought it couldn't get any worse. I couldn't have been more wrong. I'm still trying to figure out what story the movie is about, certainly it bears very little semblance to JRR Tolkien's ""The Hobbit"".
I suppose it's ok if you've never read The Hobbit and have no intention of reading it. It could also be ok if you hate the book.
A *few* examples of where Jackson decided to ""improve"" Tolkien's work (and no, they weren't needed for movie continuity or whatever the excuse du jour is): no elves and orcs were fighting in lake town, nor did the elves and orcs battle as the hobbits and dwarves were escaping from Thranduil, no dwarf and elf fell in love, Azog was dead for several centuries before the Bilbo's quest, Radagast (who wasn't in the story anyway) gives Gandalf the ""news"" that the Necromancer is in Mirkwood (500-1000 years too late), Smaug chases the dwarves in Erebor.
It just occurred to me, as I type this, you could also view Jackson's movies as a parody of The Hobbit, though not as good as The Harvard Lampoon's parodies.",1445990400,,1401,4.413127413127413

7006889,4,B00TFOKI7M,"The ""Hobbit"" series is the extension of the ""Lord's of the Ring"" series and sets up their story line. The ""Hobbit's"" stand on their own and except for the Battle of Five Armies contain a bit more humor than the ""Ring Series"". I actually like Bilbo more than his nephew from the ""Rings"". There are several characters that continue on, but others disappear, without a reason, which I found disturbing. The ""Dragon"", voiced by Benedict C., is chilling and worth watching ""The Desolation"" for alone. The DVD's themselves were full of beautiful scenery and sound with the exception of Disc 1 which has some pixilation sections that I found annoying and requiring restarts. All in all if you enjoyed the ""Rings"" you will enjoy the ""Hobbit"". The battle scenes in the ""Five Armies"" are wonderful.",1445817600,5,788,4.844444444444444

7006918,1,B00TFOKI7M,DVD quality was fine. But this story was dragged out way to long. Never ending battle scenes forced me to fast forward a lot of the scenes in these movies.

7006920,5,B00TFOKI7M,These are excellent movies for those who like to visit Middle Earth.  The riddles in the dark is a truly classic scene in the first movie.  The Second movie has the best movie dragon ever.  Some complain that the Hobbit movies are longer than they need to be but they do combine elements of other Tolkien books (Silmarillion) to give us a more complete story of Middle Earth. Not as good as the Lord of the Rings trilogy but Peter Jackson maintains very high production values in telling the story that leads up to the Lord of The Rings.,1437177600,2,537,4.404040404040404

I can certainly wait for the extended cuts to be released just as I did for the LOTR.  Patience and anticipation just make the final acquisition that much better as I settle in with a pint to watch them on my big screen.  My only regret is the failure of the series to feature the importance of Beorn and the eagles in turning the tide at the Battle of Five Armies and the altered ending which was not nearly as good as that portrayed in the book.
