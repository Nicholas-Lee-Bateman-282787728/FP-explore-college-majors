1752926,1,B00006G8I2,"It seems that Carol Burnett's producers can't give fans what we really want:  a compilation of whole skits or entire shows.  Instead we get brief clips, cast reunions, superfluous intros,  and new songs.  I was really looking forward to re-seeing some classic show-stopping skits in their entirety (maybe even some of my personal favorites). No such luck. Most of this tape is the four lead cast members reunited for sometimes awkward banter with each other and the audience (who magically ask questions that lead directly into the next clip).  The clips are so whittled down that there's no context and no buildup. Some are so short that they just show the cast members breaking into laughter without any indication of what they're laughing at. Are Carol and the other leads so desperate for work that they insist on being taped for what should be archival compilation videos? Do the producers really think we would rather have a tiresome new song paying homage to Bob Mackie than more of the old shows? Is there some legal reason why the Carol Burnett shows (or at least whole skits) can't be issued for sale? And why is Lyle Wagner so glaringly absent from this tape -- does HE own the rights to the old shows? Perhaps someday those old favorite episodes will be reissued in their entirety on home video (as the Muppet Show producers are doing), but this ain't it. What a shame.",1059091200,45,1381,4.713692946058091
1752927,1,B00006G8I2,This was quite a let-down.  Minimal snippets from the original show. (Though there are a few bawdy moments that are good for a laugh.)  Most of it was question/answer with the audience and some tribute song/dance routines.  If you are a hard-core fan you might enjoy this walk down memory lane.  I would have preferred to see more of the original show.,1053820800,50,352,4.629032258064516
1752928,1,B00006G8I2,"I thought this dvd would have at least scenes lasting more than 30 seconds.  Most of it was the actors on the show sitting around and watching how they cracked each other up with laughter or talking to each other.  I guess I will watch what I buy from now on because I was expecting the funny skits like mama's family.  I've learned my lesson, I will only buy actual seasons on any of these tv shows from now on.",1044921600,18,412,4.125
1752929,4,B00006G8I2,"Carol reunites with her co-stars (except Lyle Waggoner) on Stage 33 at CBS --- the exact spot where Carol and company had us laughing for 11 seasons. The result? A hilarious visit back to some of the funniest moments on the small-screen (yes, the Scarlett-O'Hara-wearing-a-curtain-rod spoof is here), as well as rarely-seen outtakes, bloopers, blunders, ad-libs, questions from the audience and moments when the stars themselves break down from their co-stars' antics. (Think Conway; think Korman.). It all works nicely, and it's so nice to have this time together, but the of loss of Lyle is noticeable and jarring.",1042934400,6,616,5.232323232323233

1752931,5,B00006G8I2,"I enjoyed this reunion special of 2001 as I enjoyed the other a few years ago in 1993. Thanks to CBS for allowing the most daring and adult outtakes and bloopers to be shown. It was so much fun to see Carol Burnett, Vicki Lawrence, Tim Conway and Harvey Korman back together again and able to laugh at themselves as we laughed with them at home. Check out the blooper where Carol flashes the boobs she is wearing in front of Tim Conway. Buy the VHS video or DVD today.

1752932,1,B00006G8I2,All I expected was an hour or so of comedy sketches from a show which I have fond memories of. What I got was a 40 minute television special which spent most of the time introducing the cast and fielding questions from the audience. The comedy sketches that were shown were just edited snippets of the cast trying to suppress their laughter at a joke the producers of this DVD didn't feel was necessary to share with the viewer. It was terribly disappointing. Even the famous `curtain rod Scarlet O'Hara' sketch was edited down to only a few seconds of the audience laughing at Carl Burnett's attire. It's like telling the punch line of a joke without the setup. It is obvious that absolutely no effort was put into this DVD. I doubt very much that Carol Burnett had any input into this product. If I were her I would be mortified. A complete waste of time and money.,1040947200,13,867,4.459119496855346
1752933,5,B00006G8I2,"Carol Burnett not only has managed to make us all laugh on purpose, she's made us all laugh even when she wasn't trying.  This reunion special is more about the bloopers that they all had while on the show.
The funniest is from ""Mama's Family.""  Tim Conway and Harvey Korman's bantering is hilarious as are Carol and Vicki Lawrence.
Prepare to wet your pants laughing.  Get the Depends out and pop this video in!",1035158400,13,412,4.54054054054054
1752934,5,B00006G8I2,"I am a faithful fan of Carol and team and was realy looking forward to the DVD.  It was great to see them all, but, what I thought was a great pity, is that just part of certain scenes were shown.  The ""naughty"" words were still bleeped out, and it was too short.  Even though, I recommend it highly.
I would wish that the shows that were televised daily on some TV stations, would be put on DVD.  I would buy the first one and all that follow.
Carol, your fans miss you.

1753059,5,B00006G8I2,"I just watched the whole thing on youtube, and was really glad to pop over to Amazon and see it here.  I've just sat here mesmerized for the last 45 minutes, watching clips of shows I hadn't thought of in years, and seeing a couple ones I don't remember that were hilarious!

I love this idea of a reunion show and showstopper clips!  I loved seeing Bob Mackie and the tribute to him; I hadn't known he designed all the costumes on there; I thought he just did the haute couture clothes.  Was also really nice to ''meet'' him, as I had never seen him before.

I adored the camaraderie they all shared, and loved sharing this with them.  Loved the clips, especially Mama telling Eunice that someone had blown her pilot light out!  Was great seeing Charo and her ''Mama;'' that has always been one of my favorites.

I do not get all the complaints.  This was a reunion show.  The DVD was made from the show.  I think they did a magnificent job getting so many clips on there in such a short amount of time, while still having time to have fun with each other and the audience.

This was NOT just a DVD made to have every funny skit that was ever on there in DVD form.  That would take MULTIPLE volumes of DVDs.

The only thing missing to me was that Lyle Waggoner wasn't on the show!  But did love seeing them all, and they really boosted my evening!  Thanks to Carol, Vicki, Harvey and Tim for a great trip down Memory Lane!",1364601600,,1423,4.253731343283582
1753060,2,B00006G8I2,"I don't mind the Carol Burnett show, but loved Tim Conway and watching him make harvery laugh...in my oppinion he made the show. One would think on a Carol Burnett video you''d get some carol burnett show. Well you get a sniff...that's it! It's mostly fan oriented hype. You get about 6 or 7 people asking the foursome some questions, you get them singing about their show, you even get the costume designer shown and sung about...and squeesed in among all this you get about 15 minutes of short show clips...yeah that's all you get...this video is 43 minutes long, and they even include credits in that 43 minutes...

1753120,2,B00006G8I2,"First thing you should know is that this is advertised as outtakes and discussion between the cast....years later. There are too many questions from the audiences, but if you like banter, you will probably give this a five. The clips are short, however, when do you see long outtakes? They need to set it up and then play the clips. It's a long show about outtakes. So, with all of that said, I love it. The Elephant sketch is my favorite, and second is probably Carol flashing Tim and busting him up, and then turning around to show the audience....hysterical. A few things, the actual transfer is not as good as it could be. I wish they would have done a better job there. Also, there is no need to bleep the bad words on a dvd....I would have loved to hear the uncensored version. For these two reasons I took off a full star. I just think all the audience time makes it feel longer. okay....watching it again, I have downgraded it to 2 stars because of the musical numbers....COMPLETELY unnecessary and time consuming, and because it was just too short! This could have easily been a 5 star DVD, with a little effort. WARNING: there is a Bob Mackie tribute at the end....Why? I really don't know. It makes no sense, unless Bob Mackie was behind this DVD and was trying to promote himself. The ending was a complete waste! 2 more stars off for this. If you choose to ignore all of the bad reviews because you are a HUGE fan (like me) you will end up writing a review similar to the ones you have already ignored and warning people not to follow in your footsteps...so, rent it....PLEASE...rent it....or, better yet, go to youtube and look for your favorite clips....you'll be better off......I'm glad I rented it....mailing it back.",1301097600,2,1735,4.546325878594249

The rest of the disc is outtakes, which are funny for about five minutes. I don't recall there being enough time devoted to a single sketch to allow you to appreciate the humor of the sketch itself. So if you're a fan, you already know that it's easy to get Harvey to crack up. If you're not famililar with the show, you'll wonder what all the fuss is about.",1162857600,35,685,4.4015748031496065

The Bob Mackie tribute went on for what seemed hours. You'd think they'd have included this tribute as an bonus, except this DVD has no extras. None.  You get 42 minutes of self-congratulatory chit chat, with four of the original five in the cast and a few unfunny clips of Tim trying to crack Harvey up (and succeeding) of Harvey succeeding in cracking Tim up, of Vicky and Carol trying to crack everybody else up. (And what was up with Vicky Lawrence? She looked so uncomfortable in the DVD. Maybe she knew what a crap show they were going to turn out.)

I didn't think it was funny when the cast tried to make each other laugh back when the show was originally aired. Where did they get the idea they were supposed to make each other laugh? They were supposed to make the audience laugh.

As far as the show goes, when the cast was being professional, it was hilarious stuff. I loved the show and wish we got TVLand so we could see it. To put out a whole DVD of the show's worst moments is a real disappointment to the ""craft"" and to the viewer.",1123977600,21,1173,4.223214285714286

However, this DVD is simply a lot of promise and no delivery.  Imagine someone tells you about this great wine.  You are shown the bottle, it's poured in the glass, you're allowed to smell its bouquet, and then... it's taken away.  That's just how you'll feel watching this DVD.  First off, the DVD is only 40 minutes long - the original hour special, minus all the commercials.  There are hours of material that could have been put into a proper DVD, so why wasn't it?  The material that is here is very funny, but 10-15 second clips just only go so far with true fans of this very funny show.  The show was so great, with such a great cast - why no one bothered to dig in and add some content to the DVD version of the TV special is way beyond me.
