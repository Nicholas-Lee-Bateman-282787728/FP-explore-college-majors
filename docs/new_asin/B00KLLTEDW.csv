6433458,3,B00KLLTEDW,"While I enjoyed most of the movies, I'm only giving the DVD en total three stars based upon the fact there were several of the movies whose picture and sound quality are very poor.  In particular Prairie Fever, Seven Alone, Young Pioneers, Prairie Women and Sign of the Otter all had horrific color, picture quality was grainey to just plain blurred and their respective sound track quality (had the sound bar turned up to the highest level!) made it hard to follow the spoken dialog.  Given the price for seven movies, if you can deal with the cited flaws, the story lines, which are pretty much all the same, are somewhat entertaining.",1409097600,6,637,4.678571428571429
