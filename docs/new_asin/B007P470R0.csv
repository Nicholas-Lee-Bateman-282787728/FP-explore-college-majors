5102494,5,B007P470R0,"Hungarian filmmaker Bela Tarr's latest, and likely last, film begins by recounting an anecdote from the life of Friedrich Nietzsche, German philosopher and philologist who taught that life is nothing more than will to power, and that the task for us is to face up to this without despair and resentment, without insisting that where there are no absolutes there can be nothing worth while, that without the security of certainties there can only be emptiness.  I don't think Tarr wants to resolve that question, but certainly aims to provide a setting that provokes it.  I don't know if there's an ultimate moral or message here, but there's certainly room for meditation on the differences between men and beasts, between life and the land it depends on, and on the kind of carrying on it takes to elevate a life towards something like dignity and meaning.  It's a profoundly moving film, that's so beautifully shot, with the subtlety of its lighting and the intelligence with which the camera moves, that it's hard to look away.  Still, with a film like this you have to be patient. In classical Hollywood style, every shot aims to convey a very specific bit of information and as soon as that information has been delivered it's time for the camera to move or cut. With a style like that of Bela Tarr, the camera moves very deliberately, but slowly and cutting is kept to a minimum and that means that either you'll be bored waiting for the next cut and the next bit of info or you are forced to slow down, and register as important details you might otherwise overlook, such as the intensity of focus with which the father attends to his daughter as she helps him with his buttons, since he has minimal use in one arm. Or the sounds, or the lighting, or the subtle variations of mood that barely register on the largely impassive faces of the man, his daughter and their horse.

The anecdote the film begins with is that late in life Nietzsche was living in Turin, and he witnessed a peasant beating his horse.  Devastated by the sight, and in an apparent effort to stop the beating, Nietzsche threw himself upon the horse's neck and wept; he had to be led home and after that was silent for the remaining years of his life.  We know nothing of what happened to the horse, and so this film imagines what may have taken place.  The peasant farmer drives the horse along a weary road, the wind whipping the dust into his face; he is met at home by his daughter, who helps him lead the horse and cart into the barn, and draws water from the well.  She assists him in taking off his jacket and boots and he lies down while she prepares a couple of boiled potatoes for a hurried and unsatisfying meal, that he eats with a painful urgency, burning his lips and fingers.  They sit and look out of the window at the wind swept hills, and there is nothing more, and the next day, if they're lucky, it will start all over all the same and won't at least get any worse.  It seems a simple life, and the film does confront us with lives stripped to the essentials, what we all face but forget by way of distractions, that enable us to look away from these essentials of toil and trouble, taking care of basic needs to eat, to sleep, to find a bit of solace in the company of another person.  These two have lost the capacity to laugh, to show more than a casual care for one another in ways that seem like habit, as when he calls to her that there is no more to be done and she should go to bed. All through, the howling of the wind never ceases.  Still, they go to bed expecting the next day to be much the same as this one.

One might think this repetition, day in, day out, offers a practical example of what's at the heart of Nietzsche's most famous image - that of the eternal recurrence of the same.  He considers this to be his hardest teaching - that one can count a life as worth living only if one could want it to recur in exactly the same way for all eternity.  There's a kind of fantasy element to the teaching as it is normally presented, but the real weight of the doctrine can be felt only when it's clear that in a certain sense, when you strip them bare of inessentials such as the fact that every day we have something different to eat and watch a different set of mindless television shows, and hear different stories on the news that are in all essentials the same, most lives in fact do amount to a kind of endlessly recurring set of habitual practices, and you could think of this film as depicting the life of everyone, who has to get up and eat and get to work and deal with some kind of incessant blowing of something or other.  Then the question would be: seeing life in that way, what exactly does it take to want it to keep on going on as always?

Bela Tarr has said he considers the face to be a kind of landscape, and it's also true that his landscapes exhibit a kind of face.  He is a master of setting, and this film is set in a landscape that is more unforgiving and stark than almost anything he's depicted elsewhere, where the wind blows incessantly and refuses to offer any sign of letting up.  Yet it seems that these characters are incapable of letting go.  They carry on, day after day, and at some point it no longer seems possible and there's nothing to be done but to continue.  One might consider this film a sustained reflection on the very will to live; but then the horse refuses, and his refusal to eat, to drink, to move on command appears here also as both stubborn and heroic, the act of a noble animal who refuses any longer to live merely for the sake of servitude, and stands in contrast with the almost empty gestures of day to day carrying on on the part of the farmer and his daughter, not out of any deep sense of care for their own existence but a sense of habit.  A neighbor stops by to borrow whisky and delivers a monologue that seems to come straight out of a secondhand Nietzsche, an effort to give some explanation, even a depressing one, to the desolation they all feel, and the farmer dismisses it as all rubbish.  One senses a resistance on the part of Tarr to explain anything or accept explanations whether optimistic or pessimistic - there is just life and there are the conditions in which a life goes on and in the face of conditions that make life almost impossible, there is the simple determination to go on or to refuse that we can witness on the faces of the peasant farmer, his daughter and the Turin horse.

Note that this review is based upon seeing the film at a festival; as I understand it the dvd and Blu-Ray release comes with a new essay on the film by J. Hoberman, and a commentary track by Jonathan Rosenbaum.  Definitely one to see from a Blu-Ray.",1332979200,66,6729,4.350359138068635

5102498,5,B007P470R0,"Bela Tarr's 2011 uncompromising masterpiece The Turin Horse is a hugely challenging, devastatingly beautiful and highly rewarding meditation on the end of the world. Shot in just 30 astounding takes, the 146 minute film charts the last six days in the lives of a stableman and his daughter in a farmhouse set in the middle of a bleak windswept plain. The film's intellectual backbone is set out at the beginning with the recalling of the story of Friedrich Nietzsche about him witnessing a cab driver cruelly whipping his horse in a Turin street because the animal refuses to move. Deeply shocked, the philosopher rushed to protect the animal only to fall into insanity after his landlord had guided him back to his room. Now, the stableman and his horse in Bela Tarr's film may or may not be the same cab driver and horse. That is irrelevent in a way. What is important is that we need to grasp what the name 'Nietzsche' connotates. He is most famous for proclaiming (in The Gay Science) that 'God is dead' and that Man is therefore free to live his own life. Nietzsche viewed humans as belonging to one of two classes: those of the aristocratic morality who are endowed with qualities of nobility, truth and bravery; and those of the slave (herd) morality whose traits are submissive - humility, sympathy and benevolence. His idea of the perfect Man is a synthesis between these two opposites in the Superman (Ubermensch). Naturally however, of course it is the master morality that dominates Nietzsche's utopian idea of Mankind as they are the most likely to have developed the vital will-to-power. This is where his philosophy becomes elitist. Everywhere in his work he displays scorn towards mediocrity, against the herd morality. Like it or not, it is the herd morality that is by far the most common and that is exactly what confronted Nietzsche that day in the Turin street. His insanity (Tarr and his writer Laszlo Krasznahorkai appear to be saying) was the direct result of being confronted by the absurdity of his Superman ideal and it is the consequence of Nietzsche's thinking on those of the herd morality (the majority of us mere mortals) that is the central subject of Tarr's film. Those few endowed with an active will-to-power may well prosper in a Godless universe, but as the drunk says when he bursts into the farmhouse later in the film, the non-existence of God for the herd also means the non-existence of a sense of good and evil, in essence Man's loss of humanity. Most humans (who possess a weak will-to-power) are unable to make their lives meaningful without the sense of something higher than themselves there as a guide. Life without a 'God' is therefore too horrific to bear for the majority and Nietzsche's only response to this realization is a retreat into insanity - life became simply too heavy for him to take. In interview Tarr has said that in The Turin Horse he wanted to make a film about ""[this] heaviness of existence"". As we follow the daily grind of the poor lives of the father and daughter (the herd) we realize that there is something wrong with the world, that in a sense it has been destroyed. Tarr also said ""the key point is that the humanity, of all of us [sic], are responsible for the destruction of the world. But there is a force above human [sic] at work - the gale blowing throughout the film - that is also destroying the world. So both humanity and higher force [sic] are destroying the world"". Bela Tarr's film would therefore appear to be a long desperate howl of despair at the decline of spiritual values and the meaninglessness of life where Mankind repeatedly ignores the existence of God, insists he has the freedom to choose his own life, but (because they are mainly of the herd morality) inevitably fall into the rut of the daily routine of everyday life so clearly shown in the narrative.

To me the very blasphemy of this viewpoint is made clear in the film by it's division into six days which suggests the narrative constitutes Chapter 1 of Genesis no less, but in reverse. In the bible God created the world in six days only to rest on the seventh. In the film God destroys the world in six days mainly because the characters refuse to acknowledge Him. Gradually the Man and the Woman lose their claim to rightful existence. They are already poor at the beginning of the film, the man's right arm is paralysed and he seems to have been reduced from a possibly more prosperous prior life to his current lowlife as a rural cab driver. The next day the horse won't move and at a stroke the pair are denied a livelihood. The horse would appear to take on the same significance as the dead whale in Werckmeister Harmonies (2000) as it silently oversees (causes?) the destruction of the world around him. Then we have a visit from a drunken neighbour who tells them of the destruction taking place in the nearby town (another parallel with Werckmeister Harmonies) and who bemoans the lack of God equalling the lack of a value system. We follow the Woman as she repeatedly gets water from the well. One day she and her father shoo away a group of gypsies who try to drink for themselves. The gypsies claim that water should be for everyone and that denying it amounts to an act of blasphemy. Sure enough the next day the well runs dry. In Genesis God gave water, in the film he takes it away. The Man and Woman's food consists of one potato per meal which now they can no longer even boil. The Man and Woman attempt to leave their now uninhabitable house and (in one astounding take mainly shot through a window) we see them beaten back on the horizon by the elements (by God himself). The next step is that God denies them light and the film finishes with an astonishing sixth day as the Man and Woman sit opposite each other across a table, inert, completely beaten. The Man says ""we must eat"", but can only manage one little bight of his raw potato. The Woman sits motionless. The gale outside has stopped, it is pitch black, God has ceased to exist and with him Mankind has ceased to exist as well.

Anyone reading this might think the film is pretentious miserabilist reductivism, and it has to be conceded that Bela Tarr has hardly been universally accepted by the film world. Admirers have made comparisons between him and other uncompromising directors such as Robert Bresson, Andrei Tarkovsky and Theo Angelopoulos. While it's true to say that if you know and like these directors then Tarr is probably for you, I don't neccessarily agree that his cinema is like theirs at all. All three of these directors have a strong sense of religious faith burning through their work. With Tarr we have the sense that he has given up on the world, and that he thinks God has given up, too. This puts Tarr into an unique class all of his own. Hence the reluctance of some to accept him I suppose. For me though, I have to say I find his films incredibly rewarding personally. I can't explain why this is, but perhaps Tarkovsky's words from his book, Sculpting in Time apply best here. Tarkovsky always said that his films were so simple that even kids could watch and enjoy and that instead of responding intellectually we should respond emotionally. That really is the key to understanding Tarkovsky's films, and I think it also holds true for Bela Tarr. Watching The Turin Horse we are hypnotised by the mesmerising long takes (like the opening 10 minute blinder of the horse being driven down the road), the astonishing Mihaly Vig minimalist music (more Arvo Part than Philip Glass I'd say) which drills itself into your brain, the incessant howling of the wind as God batters his creations to the very limits, the incredible skill of cinematographer Fred Keleman's b/w compositions, the committed performances (Janos Derzsi as the old man looking every bit like a biblical soothsayer, and Erika Bok as the suffering daughter trudging to the well every day), Mihaly Raday's narration (written by Krasznahorkai) which (along with the music) gives the whole film a sense of ritual, and then of course Bela Tarr's uncompromising direction (Agnes Hranitzky is given a co-director credit along with her usual editing). In the world today perhaps only Michael Haneke and Abbas Kiarostami have the balls to make such a raw uncommercial statement about life, completely bleak, but searingly honest and perceptive of what lies at the heart of the human condition. The film shows the end of the world, but sadly, it also shows the end of Bela Tarr, for he has said this is his last film. This might seem apt when looking at the subject matter, but actually the film was begun in the mid 1980s with a treatment completed in 1990. The film was delayed to make Satantango (1994) and then two more films before being realized. Surely the great man has more films in him. If we really have seen the last of him then it's sad indeed, for there really isn't anyone else quite like him in world cinema today.

This Artificial Eye DVD is top notch, the transfer very fine indeed. I also applaud the inclusion of the short film, Hotel Magnezit which shows Tarr's origins as a documentarist with its story of an old man being evicted from a hostel in which he has established his home. I wish more of Tarr's earlier films could be more widely released as they throw a different light on all his films made post-Damnation (1988). Bela Tarr is an extraordinary director who I'd strongly urge anyone interested in contemporary cinema to try. Not everyone will buy into his cosmic bleakness, but for those strong enough, his films are essential viewing.",1411516800,3,9598,4.671394799054373
5102499,5,B007P470R0,"Nicely photographed. Existential angst, the human condition. The visit from the neighbor scene, longest speaking role in entire film, pertinent to the haves and have-nots so prominent in the news, but not responded to from our political and economic institutions.",1407715200,,263,5.6
5102500,5,B007P470R0,"I didn't want to like this movie. I was hoping I'd find this so incredibly portentous, or so ""artsy"" or boring that I'd just turn it off and never think about it again. I mean this film is sort of a dare, a dare you challenge your friends to watch all the way through and then anyone who likes it gets made fun of for being a film snob who has totally lost their nut. There's no way this film could actually be good, right? This has got to be portentous cranked up to 11, no?

The film is two and a half hours long, shot all in black and white, and has (pretty much) only two people and a horse in it. The horse has been witness to Friedrich Nietzsche's initial mental breakdown and slowly gets sicker and sicker as the film goes on. The two people, a father and his adult daughter who takes care of him, live in a one room farm house, eat boiled potatoes, and stare out the window all day as a raging wind storm blows gale force night and day. Each day they wake up, get dressed, go to the well, boil a potato and eat it with no utensils, try to get the horse to do some work, fail, then sit at the window and stare out it till the next day.

There is almost no dialogue, and the same nearly out-of-tune leitmotif plays over and over and over and over and over again for the soundtrack. Sometimes the father coughs a little. Aside from a visit from a crazy neighbor who talks about the corruption of the world, and then later a band of gypsies who steal water from the well, the father and daughter live alone in this house day to day doing almost nothing but wait for the storm to end and the horse to get better.

But that's just what the movie is about. What the movie is really About (capital A) is far more than the sum of its meager parts. The film is about ignorance. The film exists in a world that is slowly making less sense and seems to be just giving up altogether and there is nothing anyone can do about it because nobody knows what is going on. Why does the wind howl for days on end without letting up? Why won't the horse eat? Where did the water in the well go? Why does the sun go out and not even fire will give off light anymore?

In one of the only scenes that breaks from the monotonous routine of their lives, the daughter reads a book given to her by an old gypsy man. The book is some sort of religious text that talks about holy places and how nobody is allowed into a holy place that is not worthy. The daughter can barely read and all her words run together and it's unclear if what she is reading makes any sense to these people. She's been given what might be important information but she is not able to understand it and probably doesn't care anyway. Later on they decide to leave the farm but after they crest over the hill on their property, they come right back. We never see what's over the hill, but for them to return to their farm to certain death must mean what they saw was far more terrifying.

And so the film is also about superstition and fear. Here they have a ritual where they take a shot of Hungarian wine each morning - him two shots, her one. They do this every morning. She dresses her father the same way every morning and in the same clothes. She always carries the same two buckets to the well and gets the horse cart ready in the same order each day. Both of them have such a routine that they never need to speak to each other or really communicate at all - each one know what must be done and they never get in each other's way. Over and over and over again. Because to deviate could mean disaster. This is how they've always lived and how they always will live and to change that could mean death. So in this way the film becomes much more than a study of two people and is about all of us, about the - gasp!, portentous - 'human condition'.

However, while on the surface it might seem the film is saying life is filthy and brutal and generally terrible, I think the film is more interested in showing us the dangers of isolation, of prejudice, and of ignorance while also providing the empathy we need to understand people who live in a world where this fear and ignorance rules their lives. This is why the film is such a slow meditation filled with long takes of small details and little 'action'.

This is an incredible film and the ending is so powerful that it unnerved me. But this is a really difficult film, too, it is not easy watching because it forces you to live within your own thoughts for two and a half hours and contemplate all of human existence as you watch two peasants eat potatoes and listen to the wind.",1405209600,,4589,4.166854565952649
5102501,5,B007P470R0,"In the grand tradition of some great action adventure films, Bela Tarrs film The Turin Horse, opens with Friedrich Nietzsche.  A narrator relates the story of Nietzsche encountering a man in Turin, Italy whipping his horse because it refused to move, forcing Nietzsche to step in and protect the horse by placing his body in between the animal and the whip.  The event involving the horse in Turin apparently led to Nietzsches mental and emotional break.  But, as the film notes, no one knows what happened to the horse.  The first scene of the film, then, follows a similar horse and driver as they make their way home to a weathered barn and adjacent home.  Its not clear whether this is supposed to be the exact same horse and driver Nietzsche encountered in Turin, and even though it appears the film takes place at the end of the 19th century, it does not look like the film is set in Italy.  Even if the man and his horse do not serve as a literal link to Nietzsche and the events in Turin, they serve a clear thematic connection.

With the exception of a neighbor who doubles as a prophet of the apocalypse and a band of gypsies we see through the homes windows, the film follows only three characters, a man, his daughter and their horse.  The movie boldly refuses to offer up even a semblance of a plot.  The anti-plot unfolds over the course of six days, and in that time the viewer follows the father and daughter closely as they go about their daily business fetching water from the well, eating potatoes and getting dressed and undressed.  The horse, either because it is old and dying or because of some hidden existential malaise that seems to also permeate every frame of the film, refuses to eat and can barely serve its purpose as a porter.

Tarr appears interested in marking time.  As mentioned, the movie is divided into six days, and we follow the man and his daughter as they engage in a number of menial tasks.  At the start of each day, the daughter walks to the well, fills up several buckets, and returns to the home.  This daily event is filmed in a single shot, so we see every action.  We also watch as the two characters sit down and eat potatoes for dinner every night.  By filling up the films two and a half hour screen time with the minutia of repetitive work, Tarr seems to be asking us to examine the monotony of living.  The labor necessary to even stay alive occupies these characters world to the exclusion of nearly everything else.  With the exception of a scene where we witness the daughter reading from some sort of book, these characters spend their time being busy dying.  Their lives are labor.

The kinds of labor these characters engage in are related to their material conditions.  They must feed and clothe themselves.  There is no transcendence in this kind of work.  It is quotidian, necessary and ultimately pointless beyond mere existence.  The characters appear to have no internal lives, their conversations never extending beyond the immediate here and now.  Strangely, the stoic horse is the only character who projects some sense of understanding of these larger truths.  He is the one who refuses to eat, who refuses to go on.  And if this is merely an audience projection onto an unthinking animal, then this only further emphasizes the impossibility of making meaning in this world.

Some might wonder how its possible to spend time with these characters in the small space opened by Tarr.  But despite the films bleak tone, theres something inviting about Tarrs stark and gorgeous black and white imagery.  The little home is constantly surrounded by leaves and dirt kicked up by an unending windstorm, an appropriate visual approximation of the directors bleak worldview.  Likewise, the intermittent score by Mihaly Vig is beautiful while maintaining an underlying sense of dread.  (Although, I would be curious to see what someone could do with Tarrs images and music by the Seattle post-rock band, Earth, since they seem to be artistic cousins.  Make it happen, internet!).  While the film can be obtuse, especially towards the end, Tarr pulls the viewer into his world.  And its because he marries the beauty of everyday images with large existential questions that if you give yourself over to it, the film will stay with you long after the final fade to black.",1392508800,,4331,4.706507304116866
5102502,4,B007P470R0,"Hungarian screenwriter, producer and director Bla Tarr`s ninth feature film which he co-directed with Hungarian film editor gnes Hranitzky and co-wrote with Hungarian writer Lszl Krasznahorkai, premiered In competition at the 61st Berlin International Film Festival in 2011, was screened in the Masters section at the 36th Toronto International Film Festival in 2011, was shot on location in Hungary and is a Hungarian production which was produced by Hungarian producer Gbor Tni, French producers Marie Pierre Macia and Juliette Lepoutre, Swiss producer Ruth Waldburger and German producer Martin Hagemann. It tells the story about a middle-aged horse owner named Ohlsdorfer who lives in a house on a farm nearby a town in Turin, Italy with his daughter and a horse. A few days after having been stopped in the nearby town by Friedrich Nietzsche where he was whipping his horse because it didn`t want to move, a windstorm bursts up and the man`s horse becomes increasingly resistant and will neither move nor eat.

Distinctly and precisely directed by Hungarian filmmaker Bla Tarr, this quietly paced fictional tale which is narrated mostly from the two main characters` viewpoints, draws a dense and ritualistic portrayal of six days in the lives of a father who mostly sits on a chair looking out of a window and his daughter who assists him getting dressed, goes to their well every single day and makes them dinner. While notable for its distinct and atmospheric milieu depictions, sterling and low-keyed cinematography by German cinematographer Fred Kelemen, production design, costume design by costume designer Breckl Jnos and use of sound, colors and light, this narrative-driven story about human existence where two isolated people who are living a repetitive lifestyle and who have been living together for many years are waiting for the weather and their horse to become better, depicts three interrelated and internal studies of character and contains a poignant and timely score by Hungarian composer Mihly Vig.

This observational, austere and poetic drama triangle which is set in Italy during a spring in the late 19th century and where the similarities between two human beings and a horse becomes more and more apparent, their lives more and more challenging and hope increasingly intangible as the wind grows stronger and stronger, is impelled and reinforced by its stringent narrative structure, subtle character development, rhythmic continuity, distinct atmosphere, silent and contemplating characters, long and philosophical speech, describing voice-over narration, dark and mysterious undertones, the internally and externally expressionistic acting performances by Hungarian actor Jnos Derzsi and Hungarian actress Erika Bk and the fine acting performance by Hungarian actor Mihly Kormos. An existentialistic, cinematographic and majestic statement from an accomplished auteur filmmaker which gained, among other awards, the Grand Jury Prize at the 61st Berlin Film Festival in 2011.",1387152000,2,3010,5.5271149674620395
5102503,4,B007P470R0,"I just finished watching this for the second time.  The first time I basically threw myself into it, suspended disbelief, tried to get into its flow and pace, and didn't analyze it too much.  One of my favorite directors is Tarkovsky and I'm not at all averse to slowly-unfolding, almost static films; so the slow pace of The Turin Horse didn't bother me.  I found the cinematography to be excellent and there were some moving poetical moments; but the emphasis on repetitive daily life routines got to be pretty tiresome, which was aggravated by the ever-present minimalist musical score, a single 16-bar theme that was repeated over and over.

The second time I watched the film I paid closer attention to the diatribe of the neighbor who comes over to borrow some brandy.  He speaks from a somewhat Nietzschean viewpoint, except that according to him God plays a role in things.  He seems to be saying that the Nietzschean noble natures, those persons ""beyond good and evil"", basically capitulated and handed the world over to the corrupt and debased. So we're left with a disintegrating world which is the result of ignoble human nature, pushed along by a God that may be vengeful or may be equally ignoble and corrupt, it's a bit hard to tell.

I found that this pardoxical message added quite a bit to my appreciation of the film.  I was even able to find some value in the portrayal of the dull routines of the characters inasmuch as I saw them contrasted against the almost cosmic drama which was being played out behind them in the background.  While the world is falling apart, the characters are oblivious to it, focused instead on their repetitive, almost bestially numb, routines.  Oddly enough, the beasts (the horse, even the woodworms in the house) have more of a sense of this crisis than the humans do.

However, while I can better appreciate the role played by daily routine, I found I just didn't have enough patience to watch the characters go through all that again: getting the horse out, putting the horse away, getting dressed, getting undressed, cooking potatoes, eating potatoes, getting water from the well, throwing away the wastewater--I feel like I ""got"" the idea the first time I watched the film and didn't want to re-experience the tiresomeness of it all.  So, I'm afraid, I fast-forwarded through a lot of the film the second time.  I may watch particular scenes of it again in the future because I think there are some fine artistic moments in them, but I don't think I need to relive the tedium of much of what's portrayed here.  I understand that this tedium may have been part of the director's intention, but I don't see the value in returning to it repeatedly.",1380758400,3,2701,4.731343283582089

But the movie has nothing to do with either Nietzsche's life or philosophy. (Save that, perhaps, the musical score may induce the dementia Nietzsche suffered.) Rather it is an exemplar of the lives of quiet desperation uneducated central European peasants lived well into the 20th century. Perhaps for film students, there is some reason to watch this film.

Shot by cinematographer Fred Kelemen in glorious black-and-white, Bela Tarr's ""The Turin Horse"" is a movie more concerned with imagery and tone than with telling a conventional narrative. Indeed, a full twenty-one minutes have elapsed before a single line of dialogue has been spoken, and another six before we get a second (though there is some sparse voiceover narration). And that's about the average for this two-hour-and-twenty-six minute film.

The movie chronicles the daily life of a semi-crippled father (Janos Derzsi) and his weather-beaten daughter (Erika Bok) living in rural Hungary during the 19th Century. The movie does an effective job showing how, for most of our time here on earth, human experience has been a virtually nonstop battle against the elements - and a joyless, nay, soul-crushing, struggle for survival. The deliberate - some might even say funereal - pacing and lack of verbal communication between father and daughter certainly drive that point home.

We're delivered a brief respite from the redundant toil when a disgruntled neighbor wanders in and launches into a rambling diatribe on the metaphysical nature of social and economic inequality, but that doesn't last very long, and soon we're back to watching Bok hauling water, cooking dinner, tending the fire, dressing her father, etc and eating a diet that appears to be made up entirely of boiled potatoes. The movie also shows how, for many in the past and for many still living today, humans are always just one simple event - in this case, the drying up of a well, the sudden illness of a horse - away from full-blown personal catastrophe.

The movie is ostensibly based on an incident that happened to the great philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche in 1889, when he intervened to stop a cabman in Turin, Italy, from beating his horse, an incident that so traumatized the writer that he took to his bed, became demented, and lived the rest of his life in the care of his mother and sisters.  The movie extrapolates from that event to show us the life of that cabman and to speculate on what might have driven him to his mistreatment of the animal. Could it be the numbing sameness and unrelenting brutality of his life that led him to his actions? And could Nietzsche be speaking through the neighbor who comes to visit but cannot convince the father of the truth of what he is saying?

The stark landscape with its sparse vegetation and relentless, moaning wind becomes a major force in the drama as well as a key factor in these characters` lives.

Tarr's direction is hypnotic and artful, to say the least, and there's no denying that the movie does cast a spell of sorts over its audience. That's good because, otherwise, it would essentially amount to two-and-a-half hours of watching people doing chores. But you'll definitely be happier with your own lot in life after seeing it.",1364342400,7,2883,4.907597535934292

The horse suffers as much as anybody and the horse knows as much as anyone........ There are gypsies too. Water at the well, food (potatoes) and brandy and a philosophical monologue delivered by a big man who needs a drink and the ghost of Nietzsche all over the story. An old man with a dead wife and a dead arm and his daughter.....They have labored all of their lives and have depended on the horse. And now the horse.......

5102510,5,B007P470R0,"The film is shown in a 1.66:1 aspect ratio, and its subtitles are white on black for the German and Hungarian languages spoken. As for the DVD features, they are solid. The first is s brief 12 minute short film Tarr made in 1978, called Hotel Magnezit which depicts an aging alcoholic who is persecuted by unknown others for alleged wrongdoings. It is not in good shape, visually, and the acting is very poor, to say the least. It's at best, a misfire. Then there is a near 50 minute long press conference at the Berlinale Film Festival, wherein Tarr, his three main actors, and his technical collaborators, answer question from an international group of reporters. While there are a few moments of insight, the stark contrast between the depths of the film and the insipidities of the assorted reporters makes for many awkward moments, where the viewer feels sorry for the questioner and senses the artists' frustrations. There is also the theatrical trailer, and a small booklet with a very poorly written and teeth-gnashingly trite essay, called Brute Existence: The Turin Horse, on the film by American film critic J. Hoberman. Finally there is an audio commentary by another notoriously bad American film critic, Jonathan Rosenbaum, that is one of the worst that you will ever encounter.  It truly does seem that the Golden Age of DVD commentaries is at an end. Aside from the fact that the commentary has silent gaps, it also only runs less than half the length of the film because, as Rosenbaum says early on, he thinks the film needs no commentary. So, then why agree to do the damned thing? Let someone with more enthusiasm take over. As for the actual commentary? It's rather pathetic, for Rosenbaum adds almost nothing original, instead mostly reading others' critical opinions on the film, and then even relying on biographical and career information on Tarr from, of all places, the always unreliable Wikipedia. It's truly an astonishing train wreck of a commentary- one which Rosenbaum calls his first solo commentary, and hopefully, for the cineastes out there, what will be his last commentary. Aside from the absolute lack of anything meaningful to say on the film, Rosenbaum's nasal, screechy voice is a turn-off, but even more so is his constant pimping of his own career, and the fact that he is going to be teaching, in 2013 at a new film school Tarr is opening in Croatia. About the only positives that one can say of Rosenbaum's nearly 70 minutes of speaking is that he makes two salient points that few other critics have noticed: 1) that despite being labeled anti-Hollywood, Tarr's films are often shot on sets, and Rosenbaum claims this film was also shot on a soundstage. 2) He acknowledges that Tarr's camera is always doing something interesting to offset the seeming repetition of the activities the characters engage in, and this counterpoint between action and depiction helps craft a grand narrative from what seems to be little material. Other than these two points, Rosenbaum's relentless need to posit himself as an insider into indy film circles, and his utter lack of insight into the film at hand, make listening to the commentary a chore.

  While the film was much honored at a number of the international film festivals it was shown at, it did not make the list for best Foreign Picture Oscars in America (surprise, surprise). Yet, despite this snub, The turin Horse is yet another great film in Tarr's canon, at least equal to Damnation and Satantango, clearly superior to The Man From London, even if it likely falls a bit shy of Tarr's greatest film, Werckmeister Harmonies. It is a brutally great work of realism in an oddly closed universe consisting of one windy plain (see the scene where the pair try to leave their home, only to wind up right back in it). Near the end of the film, the unnamed daughter asks of her father, or perhaps rhetorically (it does not matter), What is all this darkness?

This movie, despite its title and what some of the press material said, has nothing to do with that particular episode. In a windswept, cloudy, barren plain (the movie is clearly not set in Italy), an old man and his grown daughter live in a solitary ramshackle cabin, along with a work horse. We see them do their repetitive daily chores (for instance, she cooking or helping her father put on his clothes), barely speaking a word. Despite the accolades it received from some critics, this black and white, almost silent movie, seems rather pointless to me. As an exercise of style is does show some talent from the part of the director, but the film ultimately seems to have nothing to say (unless the movie is about the repetitive, pointless lives of many people in the lower rungs of society, but you can make a film about that theme without recurring to such artsy, off putting mannerisms). The director, Hungary's Bela Tarr, is a darling of the most avant garde film critics.

5102513,5,B007P470R0,"In this day and age of digital cinematography, it is a breath of fresh air to see that there are still films being made that create the illusion and imagery based on a natural setting and the actors playing a part within that setting.  Director Bla Tarr shows the natural effects of a barren landscape and the emotions that each character in the film the Turin Horse, which automatically conjures similarities to legendary film director Ingmar Bergman because of the emphasis of the moving characters that speak very little in spite of the subtitles that are interspersed throughout the film and trademark cinematography of light and dark shadows.

The Turin Horse is based on Philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche's account of a horse in distress and attempted to rescue it from its uncompromising situation.  The horse was released but it remains a mystery to what happened thereafter.  Tarr picks up where Nietzsche left off through a creative lens, the film centers upon a father Ohlsdorfer (Janos Derzsi) and daughter (Erika Bk) and the horse (Ricsi) that pulls their cart to maintain their livelihood.  The production of the film is extremely effective without a soundtrack but merely the actors playing their part in repetitious scenes and the camera focusing on the horse with much distant and up front close-ups.  Without constant dialogue, the silence and the actions of each character speaks much more to the viewer; lends itself to various interpretations but one that resonates the most, eternal light in a world of darkness.  There are also subtle suggestions in the film that evokes a tone of religious and philosophical contemplation, living off the land and self-reliance.  And also, a historic theme of past and present is shown with the characters and their attempt to leave the horse behind, somewhat ironic and heart wrenching.

One can be amazed by watching the film and to realize that it was released in 2011.  There is no denying the parallels to the Bergman film legacy, and if Bla Tarr intended to emulate Bergman, he does an exceptional job.  Film aficionados that have not yet experienced this film, it is indeed highly recommended.  And one word may describe its powerful message, humanity.",1351209600,3,2214,5.035616438356165

Who is trapped? The horse or the people? Sisyphus analogy except their tasks seem to get harder with time. The music and changing camera angles added to the sense of isolation.

Here, the wind is music and Tarr's familiar film score from Mihly Vg becomes a kind of sweet pain killer. Deadly serious, but not without great suspense, The Turin Horse opens a window to the decay of a world that knew better days. The mother is gone, the other horse has died (or maybe was stolen), the father's right arm that built this magnificent stone barn and house has expired, the bird cage is empty. And it is sad, this last film from Bela Tarr. It's like death: mine, yours, the world's, the cinema's. Without light, how can those images be projected?

But, what are the daughter and father watching but a movie? Theirs is a kind of patience, but like the great Tibetan meditation master Chogyam Trungpa said, it is perhaps a patience without wisdom, without clarity in which, after time, people crack. Perhaps the characters are caught in a net of forbearance. Does the camera eye free us? Are we then able to transform forbearance into intelligent patience? Should we watch ourselves watching movies? And at the end, is the light of our minds enough?

5102527,5,B007P470R0,"Bela Tarr is famous as one of the ultimate love-it-or-hate-it directors.  Either you like ridiculously long takes, sumptuous black and white cinematography and bleak existentialism, or you don't.  For my money, The Turin Horse is his greatest film to date.

Werckmeister Harmonies is probably the best entry point for Tarr's work, since it's got an accessible plot, a likeable main character and some beautiful visual metaphors.  Other Tarr fans may prefer Damnation for its specific commentaries on life in Communist Hungary.  But The Turin Horse is Tarr's sparest and most elemental film to date, and a tough pill to swallow.

The film's frame intro involving Nietzsche is window dressing, only serving to explain why Tarr made the film he did.  The film itself is incredibly simple: An aging man and his adult daughter live in a one-room house on a farm in the middle of nowhere with nothing more than a well, an oven and a horse.  Suddenly the horse refuses to work or even move.  Soon it refuses to eat.  The man and his daughter must confront the fact that if their horse won't work, they are doomed to starve.

That's the entire plot.  The film follows a week in the lives of this small family, as they follow the same routine with little variation: The father wakes up and the daughter helps him dress.  He tries in vain to get the horse to work, gives up and goes back to bed.  The daughter fetches water from the well.  They have dinner, which consists of one boiled potato.

All the while, a windstorm whirls and pounds outside, and the house serves as the family's respite from the howling gales.  I like to joke that Tarr films the most gorgeous wall plaster you will ever see, and there's some truth to that.  The textures of the walls, the floor, the food, and the dirt are extremely vivid.  The sound design is also so perfect that you will feel battered by that wind.  It's such a relief when the door closes and the sound of the wind instantly dies down, leaving you and the characters safe in their home, as bare as it is.

This is clearly a parable, as the three characters present three different coping strategies for a life on the knife's edge of survival.  The horse has simply given up and accepted the end.  The father will never give up, and rages against the finality of death, sometimes in the absence of good sense.  The daughter is pragmatic, keeping an eye on her father to make sure he doesn't write checks that his aging body can't cash, and accepting that death is never that far away.  Sometimes outside influences show up in the form of visitors, symbolically offering their own answers.

The family listens to these visitors, but quickly concludes that nothing will improve their situation except meeting it head on.  As a result there is hardly any dialog in the film.  When you're starving, what is there to say except what is required?  Little details hint at the character's lives outside the film, but Tarr's focus remains laser sharp.

The Turin Horse is harshly, unremittingly bleak.  But in its purity, strength of purpose, and perfect execution, I found something incredibly uplifting.  I feel that a great film is never depressing, and nobody embodies that better than Bela Tarr.  After all, any species that could produce art this powerful is worth saving, right?",1345420800,10,3312,4.7043478260869565
5102528,5,B007P470R0,"Is it possible to depict existential emptiness without resorting to pretentious ""Art Film"" trickery?  Apparently so, as writer/director Bela Tarr proves in this masterful meditation on a footnote in philosophical history:  The moment when Frederick Nietzsche went mad after seeing a horse being beaten in Turin.  Famously filmed in only 30 long slow takes, this movie makes no concessions to our restless and hyperactive 21st century consciousness.  It consists almost entirely of the dull and quotidian activities of an old man, his daughter, and his horse during six days.  We see them eating their boiled potatoes, fetching water, harnessing the horse, etc. in almost total silence.  Even the poor horse seems to be depressed.  As all this began, I found myself idly (and perhaps maliciously) wondering what a great parody Wood Allen or Mel Brooks could make of all this.  Then something curious happened - I began to feel for these people as they stared endlessly out their window while the wind howled outside.  Perhaps it was the music - mournful, repetitive, and played by something sounding like folk instruments - or the marvelously atmospheric B&W photography.  Something got to me.  Later that night, the Old Man, his daughter, and the horse actually visited me in my dreams.  As cynical as I am, it seems that I had been deeply affected by this film.  I am reminded of the famous quote from one of Samuel Beckett's novels:  ""I can't go on... I'll go on.""  Make no mistake, this movie is not entertainment and it is not for everyone.

5102531,5,B007P470R0,"In the thirty shots which comprised the entire 154 minute running time of the movie, ""The Turin Horse"" portrayed the decay of an already sterile relationship between a man and his daughter living a solitary life on endlessly windswept plains, their only lifeline to the world being their horse. As the horse refuses to eat and slowly approaches death, so progresses the lives of its owners. It's a stunning work that compares favorably with the best of early Bergman. Using a palette of stark black and white images and a deliberate sense of pace that echoes the work of Tarkovsky, ""The Turin Horse"" transports the viewer into the existence of its protagonists with such immediacy and emotional power that its lingering effect never leaves you. From its opening shot of the horse fighting fierce winds to pull a cart over miles of desolate plains to its closing image, which devastatingly portrayed the resignation of all hope, the film is a tour-de-force of all the possibilities that cinema offers. And from the standpoint of technical achievement, I am at a loss to explain how some of those seven minute-plus takes were done, traveling inside and outside the house into gale-force winds with immaculate steadiness and impeccable composition, rotating 360 degrees and immersing the viewer completely in its world. There is not a single shot that feels like it's ""showing off""; every impressive tableau is so rooted into the fabric of the characters' lives that it becomes an inseparable part of the experience.

It is not an easy film to view for audiences accustomed to more traditional narrative structure. Indeed, there is nothing that even resembles a conversation in the film until well over an hour and fifteen minutes into its running time. Upon hearing a few of the comments during a screening I saw, I was reminded of how difficult it was for Antonioni's ""L'avventura"" to be adequately appreciated for its stunning originality at the time of its premiere at Cannes. It has subsequently been recognized as a milestone in cinema, as I believe ""The Turin Horse"" will be. It was a richly rewarding experience for those of us who plugged into what it was trying to say and embraced how it went about saying it. It is daring in its approach and bold in its objectives. I consider it to be a masterpiece.",1333238400,45,2309,4.875318066157761
5102532,5,B007P470R0,"""Do you remember, Milan Kundera wrote this book about the lightness of the being? We just wanted to show you the heaviness of the being,"" this is what Bella Tarr said in an interview with the New York Times referring to his masterpiece The Turin Horse.
That comment by the extraordinary Hungarian filmmaker neatly sums up this magnificent, if challenging, film. As with all filmmakers of Mr. Tarr's caliber, the film works in many different levels and has many different layers of meaning.
However, and taking Mr. Tarr's comments as an illuminating starting point, rarely, maybe never before, has the cinema focused so intensely on the harrowing, soul crushing, involuntarily heroic aspects of physical work, and in this case, physical work connected to actual survival.
In an isolated farm, an old man, his daughter and a horse face the elements, starvation, and what for viewers would definitely be a soul crushing routine. And yet in facing this apparently dreary existence Tarr's character achieve a sense of grace, including the aforementioned horse, who simply can not move anymore; they are not heroic, we don't know if they are spiritual, we just know that for them life has always been this way and will continue to be this way, if they make it to the next day.
In this sense, this film has a touch of the eternal in it, and while watching it is impossible not to think of the hundreds of millions of lives which have been lived like this throughout history in all the world, and some which continue to be lived this way. It is striking that the lives of the father and the daughter are in some ways identical in their barreness to that of the horse, with the primary goal being survival.
That is why the film has the power and force of revelation, and why, after wathcing it, you feel you have seen one of the greatest movies ever made.
In a year in which  ""The Artist"" was hailed as a hommage to silent cinema, it is Tarr's film which really has all the artfulness and brilliance of the greatest silent filmmakers. And it is also true that this will make the film forbidding for many, along with its more than 3 hours running time, almost any lack of dialogue, and the endless repetition of the daily routines of father and daughter.
In this sense, the film is a monumental achievement, akin to a ritual or sacred experience, and it deserves to be seen in as biggest a screen as possible.
 ""You are doing always the same thing every day, but every day is a little bit different, and the life is just getting weaker and weaker, and, by the end, disappears"" Mr. Tarr said in the aforementioned Times interview, and then went on to emphasize the dignity in the face of adversity of the father and daughter in the film.

5102533,5,B007P470R0,"<strong>A Torin&oacute;i L&oacute;<strong> (B&eacute;la Tarr, 2011)

NOTE: while nothing in this review is technically a spoiler (for reasons I go into detail about below), there are people who may consider some of the revelations in this review to be such. If you are one of those people, don't read this until after seeing the film.

There area number of directors--among them Ozu, Miike, Wilder, and Romero--who have more than one movie in my top 100 films of all time. But only one, B&eacute;la Tarr, has more than one film in the top twenty. Until the completion of <em>A Torin&oacute;i L&oacute;</em>, released in English-speaking countries as <em>The Turin Horse</em>, Tarr was not only the greatest filmmaker of modern times, but possibly the greatest filmmaker of all time. Now, he has retired. Aside form the fact that this is a major blow to the filmmaking industry, it does have bearing on how one reacts to <em>The Turin Horse</em>, which would be joining <em>Satantango</em> and <em>Werckmeister Harmonies</em> in my top twenty were it not for one minor problem (more on this later, however brief). This is because while one can certainly get a sense of <em>The Turin Horse</em>'s soul-crushing despair despite having never seen a single frame of a Tarr film before, if you are familiar with the director's previous output, ""soul-crushing despair"" is far too light a term for what is, in every sense, a tale of the apocalypse. Yes, Tarr--Tarkovsky's greatest disciple, the man who took the long shot to such absurd lengths that even Tarkovsky never dreamed of--has finally made the love letter to Tarkovsky's science fiction days that has been markedly absent from his oeuvre.

""But wait,"" I hear those of you saying who have gotten a chance to actually see the film (which has only played in very limited release in America so far), ""there's nothing at all science fictiony about this movie--it's more of Tarr's dreary black-and-white realism."" And you would be right, but bear with me here. Explaining where I'm coming from requires a journey back thirty years. Possibly more, but getting one's hands on Tarr's early work has always been a bit tricky, and so the first of his films I've seen is 1982's <em>The Prefab People</em> (viz. review 15Apr10). It is intensely realist--I compared it to Jost and Cassavettes--but with the benefit of hindsight, I think this may have been the beginning of Tarr's creation of an alternate-universe Hungary, the taking of little poetic licenses here and there in the same way many filmmakers do in order to highlight a point or what have you. Then came <em>Almanac of Fall</em>, which is far more Bergman than Jost, and with Bergman must always come fantastic influences. (Never forget Tarkovsky leaning in the background.) It is an ugly, brutal, depressing film that manages to look realist while being the place where one can actually see reality fracturing away from Tarr's worldview. After this, three films with increasingly monumental events whose effects ripple through this now post-communist alternate Hungary: <em>Damnation</em>, <em>Satantango</em>, and <em>Werckmeister Harmonies</em>. It may be flip to say so, but the seemingly anomalous 2007 film <em>The Man from London</em> even fits; where else but in an alternate universe would Georges Simenon's novel have been set in Hungary? And while the events in the three preceding films echo throughout the country, in this one we have international implications. Where I'm going with this: the more you have immersed yourself in the world that B&eacute;la Tarr has created over three decades, the more this movie will mean to you. (In other words, if you haven't watched at least <em>Satantango</em> and <em>Werckmeister Harmonies</em> yet, wait on this one until you have.)

Which leads us to <em>The Turin Horse</em>, along with the reasons that (a) Tarr is retiring and (b) this is actually an apocalyptic sci-fi flick: B&eacute;la Tarr destroys the world.

This is not a spoiler, or at best it is only a minor one, since we find out quite early on, in a scene almost every review of the film I'd had a chance to read before seeing it focuses on: Bernhard (Mih&aacute;ly Kormos, a Tarr regular, as are all the principals in the movie)'s visit on the second day because he's run out of alcohol. Asked why he didn't just go into town to buy some, he tells us the town has gone to ruin. This is the beginning of a five-minute monologue about the metaphorical destruction of the Earth from a Marxist perspective (""man acquires and destroys, or man destroys and acquires...""), which may throw you off a bit, but remember: the town has gone to ruin. Bernhard came to tap Ohlsdorfer (J&aacute;nos Derzsi)'s dwindling stash because <em>he can't get any in town</em>. Outside MacKendrick's <em>Tight Little Island</em>, has that ever happened before? Anywhere? It points to the rest of Bernhard's speech being metaphorical, but that statement being absolutely literal. The town no longer exists. It has been destroyed. In fact, the world, with the exception of a few wanderers like Bernhard, now has its boundary at the tree that can be seen through the farmhouse window. There <em>was</em> a world there before the first day; the opening shot of the film, so quintessentially Tarr, shows Ohlsdorfer riding his cart, drawn by the title character, down the road to the farm. At that point, the wind is getting up a bit, maybe there's a little creeping fog, but by the time we get the ""the first day"" title card, we're in the middle of Stephen King's <em>The Mist</em> combined with Victor Sj&ouml;strom's <em>The Wind</em>. We even get monsters from the former and crazy from the latter, both during the third day. Going into that <em>would</em> be a (minor) spoiler, but I will remind the reader that Tarr's films have always had the same structure of deep, lethargic slowness punctuated by a moment of shocking violence (the murders at the beginning of <em>The Man from London</em> and the middle of <em>Satantango</em>, the riot at the end of <em>Wreckmeister Harmonies</em>); here Tarr returns to making the violence the dead-center shot of the film, but the violence in question is not nearly as theatrical, or for that matter as violent, as in any of the previous films mentioned. It's actually quite pathetic, in every sense of the word, which serves to underscore the pathetic existence shared by Ohlsdorfer, his daughter (Erika B&oacute;k), and the horse (who, the credits tell us, is named Ricsi).

And yet those who are willing to devote to the film the concentration that it deserves will note that while the family's existence is a mindless haze of numbing repetition, Tarr's depiction of it is anything but. Consider mealtime during the first two days. The daughter dips water (which she has brought from the well each morning, another series of scenes that illustrate this nicely) from the large bucket on the back of the stove into a pot containing two potatoes. They cook. She gets the wooden plates, the serving bowl, and the salt cellar from the cupboard and lays them out. The potatoes go into the bowl. ""K&eacute;sz."", she says. (""It's ready."") They go to the table. They eat, about half the potato each time, with the leavings scraped after the meal. The actions themselves are the same. On the first day, the camera is sitting just over the daughter's shoulder, and we focus on Ohlsdorfer, who is old and has lost the use of his right arm (a stroke, one assumes, or perhaps the horse kicked him at some point). Ohlsdorfer is not a patient guy. (This is important later.) He burns himself peeling the potato, he flings salt onto the plate, he wolfs down piece after piece, then thrusts himself from the table--as much as a guy with the use of only one arm <em>can</em> thrust--and stalks off, leaving his daughter to clean up, after she's done; it takes her about twice as long to eat her potato bits as it does Ohlsdorfer. The second day, the camera is behind, and a bit to the side of, Ohlsdorfer, and we focus on his daughter. We see that she is slower, more deliberate. She does not use salt. (In a film where everything is pregnant with meaning, I have a perverse urge to pontificate this was simply the actress' preference rather than Tarr and co-conspirator L&aacute;szl&oacute; Krasznahorkai making a comment about the daughter's personality.) She blows on each piece of potato. If these people were affluent enough to be able to afford utensils, you get the idea Ohlsdorfer would still go about burning his hands, while his daughter would at least have mastered the use of knife and fork. We hear Ohlsdorfer eat, but aside from a few arm movements, we don't see him. We see only her.

This may seem a small thing, but it is synecdochic of the way Tarr and cinematographer Fred Kelemen (the director of <em>Krisana</em>) gradually reveal the little universe of this film. We suspect the cupboard exists--those plates have to go somewhere--but we don't actually see it until the third day. The spatial relationship between the house, the barn, and the well also comes into focus on the third day; for all we knew before then, the barn was off on another planet, for all that it featured in shots. This is one of the things in the film that really holds our interest as viewers, that we continue on for the first two hours of this two-and-a-half hour film continually discovering things about the scenery. Which is pretty impressive given that the scenery is all but unremarkable save where it is destroyed (more on this in a bit). Tarr is creating something out of not nothing, but very little, and he's doing it successfully.

Where so many other reviews focused on the Bernhard visit, I'm actually coming to a point with these last few paragraphs, what is to me the central scene of the film, the most important one, which takes place on the fifth day. This is not the climax--were it possible to think of a film this flat having a climax at all, one would have to place that at the moment of violence that sits in the middle of the film--but it is by far the most important scene, the one where everything crystallizes in your head (or should, if you're paying attention). Each day, part of the routine is dealing with the horse. There is stall-mucking, giving him hay, trying to get the recalcitrant beast to move. Now, in that very first shot, it should be obvious this horse is in a bad way. He's malnourished (but then, this is a symptom of life; everyone in the film save Bernhard is malnourished), somewhat flea-bitten, mangy. He does not look good. Each day, he spirals downward a little. (Again, this is not a spoiler; every plot summary focuses on Ohlsdorfer coming to terms with, as IMDB puts it, ""the mortality of his faithful horse."") Every day, we get the horse maintenance from a different angle, giving us more information. (This is not isolated. On day three, one of the exterior shots shows us, for the first time, that the barn wall has a huge hole in it. On the fourth day, after the barn door is closed, we linger in the barn, with the horse, the only light coming from that hole.) Day five: the ""horse"" shot happens after the daughter closes the door. We linger on the barn door. Not the whole door, just a piece; this is a close-up. Even the dimmest of filmgoers realizes what this symbolizes. And yet there's Schrodinger's tiny cat sitting there on your frontal lobe asking ""is the damn horse <em>really</em> dead?"" It ended up being as tense a moment as any I'd experienced in a theater in years. At the risk of sounding, well, snobbish (I am, and I'm unapologetic about it), that's the great payoff for paying attention to the smallest details in a movie. When you're at the mercy of a master director, even sitting there staring at a piece of a barn door for three minutes can become a pitch-perfect exercise in tension.

(As an aside, there was a great station identification-style reel that played before movies at the arthouse in Philly where I was first introduced to, among others, Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Charlie Chaplin back in the early nineties. It started off with a spoof trailer for an Eastern European art film called <em>Look at My Potato</em>. It was hilarious. There are those who would have you believe <em>The Turin Horse</em> is the ultimate realization of <em>Look at My Potato</em>. And if you're not the kind of filmgoer who catches on to those little details, and realizes what Tarr and Krasznahorkai and Kalman are doing here, then I can kind of see their point. Which is not the same as saying those people are <em>right</em>; they have just never been properly educated in the art of watching films. Like any other discipline, be it poetry, carpentry, steak, whatever, any beginner can take a whack at creating it, and anyone can consume it. In poetry, there's the doggerel that you find in <em>Reader's Digest</em> compared to, say, Longfellow. Carpentry? Your dad building you a backyard fort is awesome, but unless your dad was Frank Lloyd Wright, it's not really going to compare to Taliesin West. And any fool can toss a steak in a frying pan and make a piece of shoe leather, but it takes true artistry to craft a perfect filet, and a discerning palate that has developed a taste for its proper accompaniments to really enjoy it. My point being: <em>The Turin Horse</em>, like every other film B&eacute;la Tarr has made, is emphatically not for beginners.)

Another aside: for the record, you're reading about a tenth of what I originally wrote. There is so much to be said about this film that a shot-by-shot-style book (a la Geoff Dyer's excellent <em>Zona: A Book About a Film About a Journey to a Room</em>) would be warranted simply to review the thing. I can point to things about the movie and say ""<em>this</em> is what makes this movie great,"" but thing 1 intertwines with thing 2 intertwines with thing 3 intertwines with...and then we load on all the personal baggage (I could go on for pages about the blasted, haggard beauty of Erika B&oacute;k in this film and how much she reminds me of two other women and what they mean to me... and actually I did, but you're not going to be reading that bit because I'm saving it for <em>K&eacute;sz.: A Book About a Film About the End of the World</em>), just like the shots gradually reveal the landscape in the film, and then use that landscape to great effect in the next scene (a la the hole in the barn wall), and it <em>all</em> deserves not only mention, but scrutiny. In most cases, I, or any reviewer, can tell you why you should see, or not see, a movie based on a few factors; Howard Hawks' infamous ""a great movie is three good scenes and no bad ones"" line in critical form. With the great movies, most of them anyway, that is not possible; everything works with everything else in order to create the experience. <em>Jeux Interdits</em> is an obvious example to me because I saw it only a few weeks ago. <em>The Fisher King</em> is like that, as well, and <em>Solaris</em> kind of goes without saying (even if the car ride to the spaceport stands out). You'll have movies like that in your head--think of favorite films you have, but favorite films where there isn't an iconic scene that springs immediately to mind, where the movie made that much of an impression on you because <em>the whole thing</em> is iconic. That's what I'm trying to depict here. That is <em>The Turin Horse</em>, in the same way that it is <em>Satantango</em>. It's a two-and-a-half hour film that feels half that length, because it's that compelling even though not a damn thing is going on most of the time. (That said, those reviewers that say Bernhard's visit is the <em>only</em> action in the movie seem to have somehow missed day three altogether.)

I did say, way back at the beginning of this review that I started writing days ago, that the movie wasn't perfect in the same way as is <em>Werckmeister</em> or <em>Satantango</em>. I also rushed to qualify that the problem is minor, and to be fair I am almost--almost!--willing to excuse the problem because of the piece that balances it. But not quite. The problem lies in Mih&aacute;ly Vig's score, and when I say ""score"" here, let me not suggest that someone is ever going to release a <em>Turin Horse: The Original Soundtrack</em> album. There are two composed pieces in this film. One of them is so subtle I'm guessing very few people without my rather eclectic (read: no one in their right minds would study this stuff) musical training would even notice it. The second is the piece of music you hear in the trailer. And that first time you hear it, in that long, long first shot (the first thirty seconds or so of which is the beginning of the trailer), it's majestic and somber and, well, let's face it, there's a reason I used the term ""soul-crushing despair"". And then the second time you hear it, you're thinking, ""okay, there's an echo of the opening here"", maybe, even though there isn't. An hour into the film, you're wondering if it's the only piece of music Vig wrote for the movie; an hour and a half after <em>that</em>, when it plays yet again over the closing credits, you know it will be the soundtrack to your nightmares that night.

Not a problem but perhaps an indulgence (and one I did not take points off for): the final three shots of this film could have all put an equal stamp of finality on Tarr's illustrious career. (In other words, warning: heavier material than usual ahead.) They could have been mixed up in any order and still would have had the same effect. It's like the end of a career with a double underline. I note this not to say it's a bad thing, but just to note it.

In sum: I had a chance, a few minutes after <em>The Turin Horse</em> finished playing, to see <em>Surviving Life</em>, the latest (as I write this) Jan Svankmajer film. I revere Svankmajer. <em>Otes&aacute;nek</em> is at #50 on my top 1000, <em>Alice</em> at #123. I may never again have the chance to see <em>Surviving Life</em> on the big screen, and I had planned on staying. But when I walked out of the theater, I simply got into my car and drove home. I could not even fathom the idea of trying to process another movie so soon after the experience that was <em>The Turin Horse</em>. And I can't imagine a film commanding a better recommendation than that. **** ",1333065600,14,18379,4.780925401322002

8520117,5,B007P470R0,"Beginning with a description of the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche sobbing as he threw his arms around a horse to save it from a whipping, the film moves to the stark image of what is presumably the same horse, pulling a man in a wagon across a desolate landscape. In the background, a mournful ostinato plays, that is heard in nearly the same form throughout the film along with the violent windstorm that, like human suffering, is relentless and inescapable.

We are introduced to a middle-aged farmer and his grown daughter, who live in a stone cabin on their desolate land. The camera lingers on their every activity in real time, from eating their meager meals of potatoes, to drawing water from the well, attaching the horse to the wagon, and the daughter helping her father, who does not have the use of his right arm, to dress and undress, like a valet. The two speak only when absolutely necessary. We see the endless drudgery of their lives photographed in stark black and white images of great beauty. The viewer is asked to contemplate scenes where the camera doesn't move, remaining fixed upon and requiring us to watch a figure sitting in front of a window, the horse's head, and at one point, even darkness as the two struggle to light a lamp. With the utmost gravity and maturity, the filmmaker's willingness to take as much time as necessary to ensure that we understand what he is showing us, elevates the brutal struggle of the two characters' existence to a universal representation of how many people still live even today.

The only breaks in the slow, deliberate movement are brief visits, the first from a neighbor who arrives to buy some brandy, and stays to give what amounts to a lecture about how certain people in power have taken everything of value in the world and perverted it to their own ends. The second visit is from a band of gypsies who invite the daughter to go with them to America, and give her a book out of which she reads a passage about a religious ceremony that purifies something that has been sullied. It is as if the first visitor tells how the world has been ruined, while the second opens the possibility of saving it.

Requiring the viewer to slow down and abandon any expectations of a story arc or other Hollywood tropes, ""The Turin Horse"" amply rewards this focused attention if the viewer is willing to give it.",1451779200,,2369,4.635714285714286
8520118,5,B007P470R0,"A very difficult film to watch for the restless, The Turin Horse is an unflinching look at the life of a farmer and his daughter in the late 1800s.  It is said  that in 1889, Friedrich Nietzsche witnessed the whipping of a horse while traveling in Turin, Italy and he rushed to defend the horse in front of its owner.  Some say that this led to Nietzsches insanity but this film  is a fictional account of what might have happened to the horse.  Yes that sounds a little far-fetched but it is fascinating movie built around simplicity and repetition.  We see the father and daughter go about their daily routine for several days in a row and each day we see things from a different perspective as the world takes its toll on them.  The fierce winds howling and blowing dirt and dust across the landscape is amazing cinematography.  A lot of people will hate this film because of its deliberately slow pace and simple moments but past the surface is a beautiful, uncompromising film.",1449360000,,982,4.571428571428571
