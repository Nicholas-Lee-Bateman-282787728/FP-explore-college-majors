8192110,5,B000PKG8WO,"This particular print looks like a matted full frame print. It's a decent print considering the film is a bit on the rare side. This is a very watchable print probably sourced from a decent vhs tape. The film itself is okay and the cheerleaders themselves are pretty average looking girls,but are good looking enough to pull off this movie. The actors playing the college football players look a bit middle-aged for a college football team,but I guess the filmmakers weren't picky about how old the actors looked. Not one of the greatest drive-in movie comedies,but certainly not the worst either.",1372809600,,597,4.920792079207921
8192111,2,B000PKG8WO,Well anyone expecting the Citizen's Kane of Cheerleader films from this will be disappointed. I love a good low brow cheerleader movie you should see my collection but Cheerleader Beach Party is a bit lacking. Even by B movie standards( if there is such a thing) this is poorly shot Chuck Vincent who was behind this film was a well known porn director of the 70's and 80's. And having seen a few of his X rated films I think that the production values on them beats Cheerleader Beach party hands down. Plus the 4 female leads playing the cheerleaders are not that good looking. Heck Vincent cast his porno actress in his other T & A films and should have here as well. Trust me I won't go into the plot or acting as you can imagine them yourself and most likely be correct. Overall Beach Party is worth a look but it's really not worth going out of your way for.,1202428800,7,863,4.300613496932515
8192112,1,B000PKG8WO,"you don't expect anything that would rival 'Titanic' when you watch a film like this, but there are some givens, sexy looking women, the ones in this film are all skinny, some funny lines, none exist, but the production quality is bad, I don't know iof the original was shot so darkly or it is just a cheap transfer but the entire film looks like they avoided filming in sunshine. if you are a cheerleader film completist, then waste the 80 minutes of your life on this one, otherwise get Jack Hill's Swinging Cheerleaders, it isn't mentailly stimulating, but the plot is much better and the actresses are good looking",1182470400,2,618,4.627272727272727
