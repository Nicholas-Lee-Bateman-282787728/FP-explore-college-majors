8348133,3,B001YKGRMK,"Miguel (Julio Aleman) and Julia (Jacqueline Andere) are a very happy couple, very happy until Miguel's love affair on the side, Isabel (Sasha Montenegro), shows up one day and messes everything up.
They try to fix it anyway, talking like the modern people they are, each one of them tries to tell their own version of the story, live together for a few days, take Isabel along like an old friend, until Miguel and Julia decide to get rid of her and ask her to get out and knock at the door again, so all three of them can start over. Of course Isabel doesn't know their plot against her, beause they will pretend nothing ever happened and that Miguel and Isabel don't know each other until now...
What?
I am sorry fellows, is not that easy ...
OK, This time, when Isabel knocks, they ignore her and pretend she doesn't exist... problem solved!",1316736000,,843,4.48051948051948
