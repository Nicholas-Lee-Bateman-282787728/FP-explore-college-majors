3880719,3,B0029RW0E6,"Angel of Death is an episodic revenge thriller originally broadcast on the web, written and created by famed comic book writer Ed Brubaker (Captain America, Daredevil, Sleeper, Criminal) and stars stuntwoman extraordinaire Zoe Bell (Death Proof) as Eve; a hitwoman who after sustaining a deteriorating injury on the job, has a change of heart about her job and strikes back at her employers.  Wholly predictable but featuring a good amount of bloody action during its brisk 78-minute running time, Angel of Death is entertaining enough to hold your interest, and the fact that Bell herself is a gorgeous sight to behold doesn't hurt matters either.",1248998400,,648,5.171428571428572
3880720,4,B0029RW0E6,"I had not watched the original web series or read the comic so I guess that makes me a non-fan/follower. On its own this would be a standard slice and fight film but with a very agile and capable action gal. Instead they included a plethora of supplements that help give this entire package a higher rating. Actually, I had ordered this because of Doug Jones as I am one of those behind-the-scenes kind of supporters and he is another one of those guys that no one knows but has been seen by everybody (Pan's Labyrinth, Hellboy, Doom, etc.).

You have a standard (and completely unbelievable in the beginning) story of a hit woman turning the tables and killing all of those she worked for in the past. This change of heart stems from having a 12"" blade stuck in her brain, but hey - this is entertainment not reality. The stunts are good, the film look is average to grainy throughout, and the acting painful at times. But what makes this (especially for the fans) are the special features.

Making of: 30 minutes covering all that went into the production outside of the focused features following.
Casting Zoe: 15 minutes of the thoughts and process behind having her be the one.
Writing Brubaker: 15 minutes catering to the fans of his and why he does what he does.
Behind the Stunts: 16 minutes (my favorite) about the real work horses and brains behind how they created and pulled off the stunts in this.
Zoe Screen Test: 3 minutes of her trying to act without kicking the crud out of someone.
Eve's Tips: Several 30-second Webisodes entailing how one can go about trying to kill like she can.

Overall, one thing the creators mentioned in these documentaries that I thought of the most in rating this, is that the movie is supposed to be entertaining without trying to be something above a B movie - and in that case they succeeded. Two and a half stars for the film, one and a half stars for the supplements.",1248566400,24,1916,4.515850144092219

3880725,4,B0029RW0E6,"I liked Zoe Bell in this as she really kicked butt, She talks the talk and walks the walk, Lots of action and no time wasted on character development.",1424131200,,150,4.206896551724138
3880726,3,B0029RW0E6,"Let's be positive first, there's probably a really good and fun movie buried in here that didn't quite make it out due budget, writer issues, and scheduling issues. If anything, I'd say this is mostly comparable to LA Takedown by Michael Mann that Michael Mann later remade as Heat. Some tweaks here and there and your movie is something you can take to a larger theater chain (even if I do prefer LA Takedown). It's certainly even fun to watch at certain points as you see a lot of creativity in their lack of budget and how they handle it. Seriously, they seem to have access to only one building that they constantly dress up as a new place each time. I'm pretty sure they are using the same 3 cars from scene to scene with flipped out hood ornaments.

And now, the rest of the story as they say. Ed Brubaker is a comic book writer who wishes he was a TV writer thinking that he'd be writing crime dramas like The Shield and The Wire. It's important to keep that in mind because Angel of Death shows just how much of his supposedly great writing is dependent on his comic book visual team (pencillers, inkers, colorers, letterers, etc) because in this case Ed Brubaker does not have a good visual team as much as team with some seemingly raw talent that is held back by various issues, which most likely all start with Ed Brubaker whose name is everywhere on this. It shows at every level. His ideas are stuff that is frankly embarrassingly over played material. Here it's La Femme Nikita meets John Woo's The Killer. I guess in comic books that counts for creativity since it's a closed eco system being dragged kicking and screaming into modernity by movies of constantly diminishing returns from Marvel and DC. However, if you watch a lot of movies and gangster films, you're gonna be watching this thinking you've seen it all before. Given the casting choices, I don't think this is the fault of the director or the rest of the team because hiring Guillermo Del Toro's favorite contortionist in Doug Jones is not a normal casting choice for a random mob doctor and shows some thought was put in. However, given this is Ed Brubaker's Angel of Death, I'm sure it was a struggle to pull off.

If it seems like I'm singling out Ed Brubaker, it's cause I am. His finger prints are all over this. The faux progressive stance where you simply replace a male role with a female doing the exact same things as a male is just the start of his unfortunate contributions. What saves the role is Zoe Bell who is a lot like action movie Judy Dench in that you can butch her up all you want she's still gonna be girly and that's part of her charm. She also manages to keep some self respect despite having to pretend to beat up guys who out weigh her by 50 pounds or so while delivering terrible dialogue. However, it's still all very much a put on. He gets to write his warmed over faux machismo but not feel bad about it cause there's a lady in the lead. A leading lady given terrible dialogue that even a male action star would cringe at even though most likely it was written for them since they are men.

I think pretty much everyone here including Brubaker can someday do something pretty fun. Once Brubaker stops being influenced by poor racial and feminist gender stereotypes from faux progressive shows like The Wire and Alias and starts focusing on just writing stories, he'll probably be worth paying attention too. I guess give him some Jean Patrick Manchette and Patricia Highsmith to read. He might even be able to write a woman as a woman and not man where he simply changes the name in his screenplay. Hopefully the rest of the team goes on to bigger and better things where they aren't under the thumb of someone who doesn't quite know what they are doing yet.",1423094400,,3769,4.459420289855072

3880733,4,B0029RW0E6,"This is a lite action flick that bares slight resemblance to Kill Bill, minus the highly stylized sets, costumes and action sequences. That's not to say it's less simmering or action oriented in production value. Although it spills much less blood than the KB franchise, it has its moments of quick paced but gritty fight sequences. There is an underlying tone of the supernatural as well, during times where Zoe Bell's character feels remorseful for her dirty deeds. Bell is a pretty capable stunt woman/actress and does manage to add a bit of sex appeal in the opening sequence...considering her tom boyish appeal. Because I'm becoming a fan of Ed Brubaker's writing style, I can see his influence all over this script and for that...my attention was grabbed.",1400025600,3,761,4.953125

I understand that she is/was the top action stunt woman(?).  Did all the stunts for Uma Thurman in the Kill Bill series and many others(?)  Her non-action acting is good, believable.  I'd enjoy seeing her in some other movies (besides just stunts).

So, I like this movie/Zoe Bell and have watched it more than once.  If you want to see world-class Female physical action (not sex), give this a watch.",1347753600,4,553,4.515151515151516

3880742,2,B0029RW0E6,"Well as the plot is carefully laid out above, I'm going to skip to the heart of my likes and dislikes.

Zoe Bell is a gifted athlete and martial artist. She's def got great potential. The cool accent and absolutely heroic physique make for a very sexy protagonist. That's where it ends.
I think this movie was rushed after Bell's appearance in the grind house film. The plot is generally weak. The fight choreography sloppy considering the skill of Bell and experience of James Lew. Timing and spacing was off on a number of instances and was just generally unrealistic and uninteresting. Poor continuity with regards to the notion that she is a highly skilled assassin when she stand upright on a rooftop doing surveillance or walk into a room of targets with a knife and some zip ties.

Lastly. With some more time in acting classes Zoe bell may be a real contender in the female action star arena. A little better timing, sincerety and physical control( she fidgets when she speaks, generally a sign of nerves).

I disliked this movie but haven't lost faith in Zoe Bell yet.",1299110400,,1077,4.657894736842105
3880743,5,B0029RW0E6,"I can't seem to get enough of Zoe Bell these days. She is a very charismatic stunt-woman-turned actress. She can do the most amazing action sequences and they always look believable, because she's always really doing them! This is a B-Movie for sure, but it's entertaining, and the action scenes are far above the standard for most movies like this. I can only hope Zoe is cast in bigger budget movies in the future, so we can really see her shine...",1282867200,2,450,4.567901234567901
3880744,4,B0029RW0E6,"I didn't know anything about Ms Bell before I watched this movie. While I agree with some of the critics that occaisionally her acting skills lapse, there's no doubting her abilities as an action hero, right down to the Bruce Willis style singlet. I found some of the tough fight scenes difficult to stomach, they may not be real but they ""felt"" damn realistic to me.
The storyline mixes up the vengeance/vendetta themes of similar movies in a clever way, and I liked the central character's response to her own feelings about the terrible things she had done. I originally gave this 3 stars, but after reflection I think it's worth 4, despite a few short comings in the lead's performance.",1273536000,13,690,4.710743801652892
3880745,4,B0029RW0E6,"""Angel of Death"" is, indeed, a movie collected from episodes of an action/crime show that aired exclusively online. Luckily enough, this isn't a fact that you need to dwell on while you're watching the film: unlike other 'movies' compiled from TV episodes - like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Crow-Stairway-To-Heaven/dp/6305495890/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Crow - Stairway To Heaven</a>&nbsp;or a number of ""Walker, Texas Ranger"" features - ""Angel of Death"" feels pretty much like a real film on its own, without intentional restraints on story progression and individual scenes. Got it? Good. Now we can focus on the other things it is - a very good solo debut for stuntwoman Zoe Bell, the real heroine behind Lucy Lawless in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Xena/dp/B0007DA3VG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Xena</a>&nbsp;and Uma Thurman in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kill-Bill/dp/B00005JMEW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kill Bill</a>.

The story: Eve (Bell) is the archetypal assassin - deadly, efficient, and utterly remorseless - but when a job gone bad and leaves her with a knife blade in her head, a haunted conscience is forced upon her, urging her to unravel a web of organized crime and take down the figures responsible for mass pain and suffering.

If you've seen the trailer for the film, the knife-in-the-head scene undoubtedly caught your eye, and I'm happy to say that that kind of grittiness is persistent throughout the film. It's not a gore flick, but action director Ron Yuan (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Dynamite/dp/B002BWP3W0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Dynamite</a>) wrangles some remarkable moments of realistic hand-to-hand violence between Eve and her opponents. This is where Zoe Bell's expertise as a stuntwoman comes in: sure, it's great to see an actress tae kwon doing somebody in the face, but to see her thrown up against walls, flung down stairs, and slammed against the ground repeatedly - with her face in clear sight - is a rare bit of practicality that we don't get to see very often and instantly distinguishes Bell from, say, Milla Jovovich in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Resident-Evil/dp/B000069HOR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Resident Evil</a>. She's like an old-school Cynthia Rothrock without the wires - tough-as-nails and legitimately entertaining to watch in action - and it will be a Hollywood tragedy if she doesn't get many more prime roles like this one.

The film runs at a slim 78 minutes in length, moving at a swift pace that allows you to enjoy its strengths and glance over its weaknesses - namely, a few underdeveloped main characters (like Jake Abel from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Percy-Jackson-The-Olympians/dp/B003HARV3Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Percy Jackson & The Olympians</a>&nbsp;as the head gangster and Vail Bloom of ""The Young and the Restless"" as his two-faced sister) and storyline tangents (e.g. Eve's romance with her employer, the black book). The movie goes for a comic book-style presentation that is neither very effective nor detracting from the overall look. The supporting cast is strong, with Brian Poth (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/C-S-I-Miami/dp/B00020H9NO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">C.S.I. Miami</a>) doing well as Eve's employer, Doug Jones (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pan-s-Labyrinth/dp/B000O76ZQC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pan's Labyrinth</a>) proving himself entertaining even without a ton of makeup, and Ingrid Rogers (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Carlito-s-Way/dp/0783227019/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Carlito's Way</a>) and Lucy Lawless make promising cameos.

Despite its smooth production, ""Angel of Death"" still feels like a pretty small movie, albeit one with a lot of potential to build on. Chances are that it's not going to knock you down or become your new favorite movie, but it deserves recognition for being a lot more solid than a lot of what's being put onto the DTV market right now. If you like seeing kickbutt in general, pick it up for something out of the ordinary and I'll be surprised if you end up disappointed.",1273017600,8,4440,6.65

3880750,3,B0029RW0E6,"There's pretty much one reason to watch this flick and that's to see Zoe Bell in action.  For those of you who don't recognize the name, Bell was the stunt double for Lucy Lawless in the Xena series and for Uma Thurman in the Kill Bill movies.  She also performed stunts for Grindhouse and a slew of other movies.  So when you watch the fight scenes, you know it's the real deal by a female lead who knows what she's doing.  The story is quite thin but most martial arts films aren't deep anyway.  The acting is quite limp and Lucy Lawless and Ted Raimi, who have cameos in homage to Bell's prior work with them, camp it up to the point you'll groan out loud.

But as the other reviewer notes, if you watch it knowing it's a ""B"" flick, you can turn off your brain and simply enjoy one of Hollywood's finest stuntwomen.",1249603200,3,818,4.245161290322581

Think of John Woo's awesome film the Killer as inspiration for Angel of Death . This film was written by legendary comics/Graphic Novelist Ed Brubaker and is shot in a Noir style akin to Sin City another film written by a comics person. Its very beautifully done dark yet pretty not unlike the back drops in the Crow or the future cities of Blade Runner.
