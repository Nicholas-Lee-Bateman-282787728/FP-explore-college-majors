7964032,5,B0000687DG,I played these in my theatre and got busted. This DVD seems a bit different from what I had screened. Good quality and I am glad to now OWN the movies I was busted for in 1972.,1303776000,5,176,3.7837837837837838
7964033,2,B0000687DG,I am going to give it to someone wanting a more graphic video than I remembered this to be. I wonder if it was reedited after it's release so many years ago and fully involved sex scenes added.,1207094400,6,193,4.105263157894737
7964034,4,B0000687DG,"This country sex comedy double feature is worth its weight in corn! ""Country Cuzzins"" is the story of a hillbilly family that finds a wealthy city snob, Cuzzin Prudence, in its very shallow gene pool. Pru may turn up her nose at her knuckle-dragging kin, but she doesn't turn away their moonshine. Before you know it she's giggling at Cuzzin Leroy's pigs and even wins the chicken chasin' contest. She invites her hick family to visit her in the city, but only so she and her ""high class"" friends can humiliate them (you know who'll get the last laugh). This one's hilarious. Both the chicken chasing contest and the cousins' discovery of Pru's bidet are worth the purchase of this one. The acting ranges from bad to wretched, though John Tull as Leroy and Ellen Stephens as Prudence give pretty competent performances, and Rene Bond is enjoyable in her role. Of course, the main distraction from the terrible acting and overlooked details like ""rich"" Cuzzin Prudence's rusty lawn furniture is all the gratuitous sex. There are naked bodies flopping all over the place--and I do mean flopping. The men in particular seem to be impersonating fish out of water when they're atop various women.
The soft-X fun continues with ""Midnight Plowboy,"" featuring John Tull as a ...stupid country boy named Junior who hitch-hikes to Hollywood only to end up living in a whorehouse. This one has less script than ""Country Cuzzins"" and, astonishingly enough, worse acting. However, if Tull and Debbie Osbourne, as one of the hookers, were allowed the luxury of multiple takes, one suspects they could've turned in better-than-average performances. The actress who plays the madame (billed as Nan Cee) resembles Pat Benatar and speaks in a soothing monotone as if she's conducting a tour of a mental hospital. She keeps referring to Junior as ""young man"" even though there's little difference in their ages. In fact, John Tull looks slightly older. But it's this total disregard for logic or cinematic convention that makes these movies so fun to watch. Though ""Country Cuzzins"" and ""Midnight Plowboy"" are both ""dirty"" movies, it's hard to imagine anyone other than 12-year-old boys getting turned on by them. This DVD also has some extra nudie loops included that highlight how even porn was innocent at one time.",1038960000,23,2299,4.974025974025974
7964035,3,B0000687DG,"After midnight blue movies for the TV (at least for the European standards) Nice natural country girls though, so rare in our days! Only for that 3 stars! It has all the elements of porno except explicit sex. Actualy i detest that kind of cinema that has no identity, no daring, not imagination, no talent after all!",1037232000,9,316,4.56140350877193
