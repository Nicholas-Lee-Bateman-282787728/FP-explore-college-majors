3435065,4,B0019ESNGY,I liked the movies and I like the fact you were able to get two good movies for one price.,1358812800,,90,3.55
3435066,4,B0019ESNGY,"Bicentennial Man is an interesting and thought-provoking film.  It raises questions about what is human, and what is intelligence.  Worth watching.
Mission to Mars is a non-memorable (I watched it, but don't remember *anything* about it) SciFi pot boiler.  If you buy Bicentennial Man you get it for free, which is about what it's worth.",1349827200,,337,5.090909090909091
3435067,5,B0019ESNGY,My whole family loves both of these movies and to get them both in the same package for a great price is AMAZING!!,1347580800,,114,4.0
3435068,5,B0019ESNGY,"Bicentenniel Man has it all - humor, love, sadness, plus it covers 200 years of history and several generations - a wonderful multi-generational story.  It's all about a quest - that of a robot to find his humanity; a lot like Data in the Star Trek series but much more enduring and epic.  Though a bit long, I could watch this again and again.",1224806400,4,344,4.359375
3435069,4,B0019ESNGY,"Bicentennial Man (3.5 stars out of 5)
*This is a cute, heart-warming saga about a robot evolving into a human.  It's an epic biographical account with strong ressonances to classier science fiction (like the works of Isaac Asimov, whose works was the basis for this film).  It's ultimately very interesting, thought-provoking, and warming.  The only drawback is that it is also long, and without any major conflict, it can be seen as tedious.  Still worthwhile for anybody looking for classy, serious sci-fi.
*The DVD has okay video quality.  Extras include a production featurette.
*Includes English and French audio.

Mission to Mars (3.5 stars out of 5)
*Yeah, most people hate this movie, but I think it's great.  It is long and slow-moving, but it has slick special effects and some good interesting ideas.  The story genuinely keeps me interested.  It's not enough to outdo ""2001:  A Space Odyssey"" (especially since this film seems to copy it so much), but it is reccomended to fans of space opera.
*The DVD has great video/sound quality.  Extras include documentaries, featurettes, a commentary, production art gallery, DVD-ROM stuff, and a trailer.
*Includes English, French, and Spanish audio, and Spanish subtitles.

Even though most people seem to loathe ""Mission to Mars,"" I say it has enough interesting ideas to make it worthwhile seeing at least once.  ""Bicentennial Man"" is the most worthwhile though, and is probably even more interesting.  Both make for good, classy, thought-provoking sci-fi.",1222473600,11,1512,5.219917012448133

3435072,5,B0019ESNGY,"robin williams portrayal of an android  longing to become a human to experience true feeling, love, passion,  was as rich with desire....yet just always seemingly out of reach-- with feeling of the need to feel loved  - the viewer  yearns for him  as much - if not more.... as the character himself.  5 stars for Bicentennial Man

3435078,5,B0019ESNGY,Bicentennial Man is one of Robin William's best. He is a robot that is somehow sentient. He learns to grow and become a human. It is full of laughs and tears and a great movie.  Mission to Mars is great. Mission to Mars is a recovery mission. The mission is fraught with danger from the beginning and the action just keeps coming.

Creates a lot of thought about how our lives would be advanced for improved health and longer lives in the future.  What is the measure of a human quality to be ""declared a human being"".

3435097,5,B0019ESNGY,"Bicentennial Man, in my opinion, is Robin William's premier movie.  His wit is present, but the depth of his acting ability shines forth in his portrayal of the man-machine who is more human than the humans who surround him.  His journey to  become recognized as human is a touching tale of love and dedication to good and right and to those who ""own"" him.  I recommend it to all who are Robin Williams fans!!!

Mission to Mars is a weak movie and not one of my favorites.  I purchased this combo to have Bicentennial Man.",1410739200,,522,4.442105263157894
3435098,5,B0019ESNGY,"Bicentennial Man is a thoughtful (and funny) treatise on what it means to be human.  It is an essential must-see for all Robin Williams fans.

3435104,5,B0019ESNGY,Best movie ever,1409270400,,15,4.333333333333333
3435105,5,B0019ESNGY,"I know there are many many great films that Robin Williams have blessed us with his humor, his acting, and his essence, but Bicentennial Man will always remain at the top of my list and hold a special place in my heart.

I think it says a lot about the range of Robin Williams' acting, when his ""robot"" phase is funnier than his ""human"" one.

This film has everything that I love: The special effects and the sci-fi premise for the geek in me; the comedic genius that is Robin Williams, and the tender, thoughtful, poignant, and romantic core that is at the basis of this story.

On the surface, you would think this is a sci-fi movie of a robot's journey to become ""human."" But sit down, put on your thinking glasses, and your enjoyment pillow, and kick back and relax and really enjoy this thought-provoking masterpiece. I don't want to spoil the journey for you, and for a better sypnosis I'm sure there are other reviewers that can much better explain it than me.

What I want to discuss, is the lasting, thought-provoking emotions it leaves with you.
First of all, embrace and enjoy the sci-fi part of it - it's just necessary because it's about a robot, so it has to be set in the future. But it really doesn't get in the way or add anything negative to the movie in any way. Nothing about the science part of the story ever interferes with the enjoyment of the movie, and the filmmakers really deserve a lot of credit for that.
Second, enjoy the acting by the wonderful cast, including Sam Neil, Oliver Platt, Embeth Davidtz, and Hallie Kate Eisenberg as ""Lil Miss.""

Finally, enjoy Robin Williams. He will make you laugh, he will make you cry, and he will make you think.
His journey as Andrew the android to become a human will leave a lasting effect on you. What does it mean to be human? In this film, sometimes that means all the ""bad"" things are just as meaningful as the ""good"" ones. The good things are that we can change, we can adapt, we can feel, we can sacrifice, and we can love. The bad things are that we are quick to judge; that we may want to change for the better, but we really don't; and that sometimes when we do change, the more we change, the more we stay the same; and do we really know what's good for us, and what's good for the world? Sometimes we think we know, when we really don't, because we think we know everything, or that what we know is the ultimate truth.

But sometimes, when it all comes down to it, to be human, just means to be recognized, and to be accepted.

In the movie, Andrew attains that ultimate goal. But along the way, he attains much more. He attains self-awareness, he attains ambitions, he attains feelings. Most importantly, he attains love - what it means to love, and what it means to be loved.

And in real life, Robin Williams does that same. We all love you Robin, we love you very much. You will be greatly missed.",1408320000,,2882,4.3638059701492535
3435106,4,B0019ESNGY,I've been looking for Bicentennial Man for a while... The Mission to Mars disc is just a little bonus for a decent movie watch.,1406592000,,127,4.333333333333333

3435112,5,B0019ESNGY,"She likes both these movies.  I am not a fan of most of Robin Williams stuff.  But Bicentennial Man is a very good example of well done science fiction.  Mission to Mars is to me a good example of a B movie of the current age though I suspect it was not crafted to be a B movie.  I like it because the violence and sex is at a very low level and so is passable as a kids movie for 13+.  We knew what the movies were when we ordered as we had already seen them.  Shipping was on time, packaging was good, this pairing was a very good price for both films together.

3435119,4,B0019ESNGY,"The reason I rate this four stars is because the two DVD set has one 5 star and one three star move.  ""Bicentennial Man"" is Science-Fiction at its best.  Innovative,  thought-revoking and humorous.  Robin Williams is perfectly cast.

""Mission to Mars"" is vague and convoluted.  I like Gary Sinise but not in this and Jerry O'Connell is less than par in his part..  The Disney attraction from whence comes the name is more exciting.

However, it's worth the purchase to get ""Bicentennial Man.""",1359072000,,492,4.843373493975903
