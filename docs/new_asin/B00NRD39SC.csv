8679873,4,B00NRD39SC,"Theres a sticker on the front of the DVD package, that was added after it was sealed, saying this is The Hip-Hop version. And that it is. This modern dance version of the often-told story of the doomed lovers (written by Shakespeare) and reimagined by Leonard Bernstein, Jerome Robbins (and Stephen Sondheim  whose name is surprisingly left out of the liner notes!) as the Broadway hit West Side Story.  The ballet of R&J had music composed by Tchaikovsky and is a stale in the dance repertoire of ballet companies.

This version was choreographed and designed by Sebastien Lefrancois  in 2008 and performed in 2011 in France, where it was captured on HD for French TV. There is a new score but its not hi-hop. Its a modern classical score with elements of electronic pops to provide the rhythms for the pops and locks and spins that are fixtures in hi-hop dance. The nine dancers are limber and talented. The costumes are modern street wear or colorful dance clothes. The scenery is composed of movable platforms.

All in all the 79 minute performance is fun to watch but there are a few elements of the DVD that caused me to only give it a 4 star rating (meaning I Like It). First and foremost is that, while there is dialogue in the performance, it is in French and  surprisingly, especially for the Arthaus label  there are no English subtitles (or even a subtitle option). The option are only Play Program, Chapters (there are 17 of them) and previews of other Arthaus releases. There is a 16 page booklet enclosed with photos and a three-page essay in English, Fresh and German.
R&J has been around for so long as a ballet, its nice to see someone updating it. Now if I only knew what the dancers were saying.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
