1809719,5,B00007G1XJ,"Olive films Blue Ray of the 1955 Paramount film in Technicolor and Vistavision is an eye popper. Tightly written with contributions by Irving Ravetch and Harriet Frank who have had a hand in some of the best adapted screenplays ever written. I'm talking about THE LONG HOT SUMMER, THE SOUND AND THE FURY, HUD, HOMBRE THE REIVERS,NORMA RAE, MURPHY'S ROMANCE and THE COWBOYS. The director is something of a legend himself. Nicholas Ray who made this gem between JOHNNY GUITAR & REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE. Cagney gets more than able support from Viveca Lindfors, John Derek & Ernest Borgnine. The tale of an ex-con (cagney) who almost get lynched and ends up sheriff over his former tormentors is riveting. Along with the Tashlin-Lewis Olive releases I purchased recently  I now feel secure that there is an alternative for classic film lovers who don't want to be reduced to MOD-R.",1339891200,12,875,4.87248322147651

1809721,5,B00007G1XJ,"Jimmy Cagney starred in three Westerns during his long acting career---OKLAHOMA KID, TRIBUTE TO A BAD MAN, and RUN FOR COVER. Of these RUN FOR COVER is his best outing as a cowboy. This handsomely-produced, Nicholas Ray-directed film also stars John Derek, with a solid cast of recognizable Western ""regulars."" The film is shot in spectacular Technicolor, with a solid and tight plot, fine acting, and great production values.

Olive Films has been releasing quality issues of a number of classic 1950s Westerns licensed from Paramount Pictures. In this series are DENVER & RIO GRANDE, SILVER CITY, THE JAYHAWKERS, PONY EXPRESS, THE HANGMAN, and THE NIGHT OF THE GRIZZLY, all of which repay re-viewing. Let's hope Olive will continue this series with such fine films as WARPATH (also with O'Brien, and directed by Bryon Haskin) and FLAMING FEATHER (with Sterling Hayden), and other other films with Charlton Heston, Alan Ladd and John Payne.

In the meantime, this film is highly recommended--it's first class Western entertainment. Thanks Olive!",1339113600,21,1046,5.25748502994012

1809723,3,B00007G1XJ,"""Run for Cover"" is a campy action film using the terrorist on the loose in New York City plot.  What makes it fun is all of the cameos.  It was a little like ""The Blues Brothers"" in that respect.  Batman Adam West, Viveca Lindfors from Stargate, Al Sharpton, Lynn Samuels, Curtis Sliwa and even Ed Koch all pop up at the most unlikely moment.  The Sliwa scene made me laugh when he called the terrorists ""dope sucking psychopathic killing machines"".  Ed Koch was also good as the mayor.  At the end of the movie Batman calls his assistant 'Robin' which also made me chuckle.
In the credits it says that the movie was shot in 3-D.  This version is not in 3-D but it's still fun to watch.  I smiled when I saw all of the close-ups of things coming at the camera.
Bombs, guns, antennae, camera, water and a homeless man's dirty feet which was gross.  Very campy.  In the credits the terrorist circles Manhattan in a helicopter looking for a place to blow up.  He circles the Twin Towers which was creepy.
The plot has some twists which were interesting. Thomas Dunne looks like William Defoe and is pretty good.  The terrorists all speak with fake accents like Hogan's Heroes but that was part of the fun.  The music is very good and the theme catchy. It stuck in my mind after the movie was over.  The editing was clever too.
I like the last shot when the hero turns off the radio and the movie at the same time.
The stills have some shots of Adam West and Ed Koch on the set.
Too bad they didn't have Sliwa and Sharpton too.  The trailer is a riot.  The commentary by the director was interesting and there were some funny stories.  I liked the one about Adam West and the cop and Koch and the monster.  It doesn't look like the commentary matches the picture but it was fun to listen to anyway. The photography is sharp and the colors vivid. The stereo is okay but there are no surrounds.  I thought it was a fun DVD, especially with the commentary and trailer.",1044057600,3,1961,4.323287671232877

1809801,4,B00007G1XJ,"After a long hiatus from doing western films, James Cagney made this film in New Mexico. The film is gorgeous especially on blu-ray. The story is about a mature gunfighter that comes to small ranch and is looking to settle down after having a troubled past. He is confronted by a boneheaded youngman who is played by a young John Derek. He spends the rest of the film trying to save the kid from himself. This is good saddle drama.",1370390400,,431,4.4

The same is not as true with Derek's character; it's all too obvious that he and Cagney have to wind up as the antagonists, and the redemption at the end is a little abrupt. TRIBUTE TO A BAD MAN is the better Cagney Western.",1365811200,3,323,4.4

It is not Silverado or Dances with wolves, but like many of the old films contains a moral lesson that something our pepple seemed to have lost sight of. It is not a story line that I have seen in any other western, so you may be pleasently surprised; I was.

Definitely worth it for those who haven't seen it.... Cagney is fantastic and Ray's direction is superb as usual....there are no extras, but the audio and video make up for that....

The photography of the country is magnificent and the story line is powerful. Great to see olive bringing back so many of these Paramount classics. Vista Vision was the go back then. Thank goodness we now have Blu-Ray. A great print. I look forward to seeing a lot more of these Paramount Classics. Keep up the good work Olive .

There are a LOT of continuity mistakes in this film. There is good acting and really, really bad acting, but the director did a terrible job. One guy standing in one elevated spot cannot shoot inside, outside, and around corners. Hanging in a dirty warehouse being tortured, escaping, taking a nap, not changing clothes or taking a shower, and then the guy seduces his ex-girlfriend? The shirt is STILL clean, pressed, and has the pressed crease in the sleeve? The sex scenes between the two couples were jarring, and made no sense in the story. What was the connection, other than a man and woman having sex? Sure, the director wanted flesh in there, but it still has to make sense in the story. Way too many gaps, and the plot was too choppy. It was like a high school graduate put it together with his feet. Great idea, but poorly executed.
