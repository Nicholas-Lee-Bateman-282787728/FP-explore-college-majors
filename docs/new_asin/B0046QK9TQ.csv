4271008,5,B0046QK9TQ,"Though the only available DVD of Cyndi Lauper's concert in Paris is from Brazil, all of the video of the concert is in English with English sub-titles if needed. The jacket copy and the menu are in  Portugese, but it is easy to get to the performance. This is not the concert that was broadcast back in the nineties on network TV.This video is longer than the broadcast version, and Cyndi spends most of the concert in a garter belt. Songs are great and the video and sound is good. Really enjoyed the video.",1341014400,6,508,4.404255319148936
4271009,1,B0046QK9TQ,"Although this performance was many years ago and new production standards were not expected, this DVD was almost too poorly produced to watch on my HD system.",1322265600,2,158,4.888888888888889
4271010,2,B0046QK9TQ,I'm a huge Ree-head. But this dvd is old. It has been on the market for a few years. It's her 1977-performance in Paris. Don't let the new title and old photo deceive you.,1322179200,2,171,4.0588235294117645
4271011,4,B0046QK9TQ,"I recently caught Cyndi in performance on her current ""Memphis Blues"" tour. She is as energetic and dynamic now at age 57 as she was when she made this concert video more than 20 years ago. I struck up a conversation with the couple sitting next to me and yes, they were suitably impressed. But the fact that they were a little surprised at the quality of Cyndi's performance and the overall show was also a reminder that in the public imagination, Cyndi Lauper remains something of a novelty act--and that, for better or worse, she has to prove herself as a performer and artist over and over again.

Although she really did achieve superstar status for a time in the 1980s, it's also true that Cyndi Lauper was underrated pretty much from the get go. Her time as a critical darling pretty much lasted as long as the hubbub generated around SHE'S SO UNUSUAL was still happening. People tend to forget that TRUE COLORS got pretty mixed reviews, and that much of that record's appeal to both the rock-crit establishment and the general public had to do with the title track, a huge hit but really her LAST truly huge hit.

She deserved better. A truly remarkable singer of considerable range and an intense live performer, there was no reason for ever fade from public view or for nearly EVERY new release to be billed as some sort of comeback. (Truth is, Lauper has remained a creative force in popular music for over 25 years: it's the public AND the critics who are coming back to HER.)

The Paris concert, taped as part of the TRUE COLORS tour, shows Cyndi in top form. One of the things about the second solo release that has never been emphasized enough is that it was a SINGER'S album. SHE'S SO UNUSUAL spotlighted Cyndi's vocal strength at key moments (the tail end of ""Money Changes Everything,"" for instance) but it was more about establishing a persona. On TRUE COLORS she had many more rave up moments (""911,"" ""Boy Blue,"" ""Maybe He'll Know,"" ""Calm Inside the Storm""). In other words, she now had enough dynamite PERFORMANCE material to do a concert video, so while a concert video follow-up to SHE'S SO UNUSUAL might have been possible--and certainly lucrative--she was wise to wait a few years.

The Cyndi Lauper presented on this DVD release is every inch the sweetly eccentric 80s pop star people had come to love (and to expect), but for those who hadn't been paying attention, she emerges as a powerhouse performer as well. She surprised people back then, just as much as she does now. The fact that she's been able to keep on keeping on for a quarter century is a testament to her endurance. This videorecording (and the more recent LIVE AT LAST and the upcoming ""Memphis Blues"" DVDs) should erase any doubts about the QUALITY of her work. Cyndi puts on a truly colorful, lively show--but she doesn't need acrobats, live animals and the Rockettes to make it great. The strong heartfelt vocals are enough to do the trick.

(One minor complaint: the packaging does emphasize Cyndi's comic persona more than the top notch singer that she proves herself to be in the performance sequences.  It's sad but true that Cyndi's career as a SINGER was nearly scuttled by her rep. as a ""figure of fun.""  There's no objective reason why an artist cannot be a girl who wants to have fun AND a lady who sings the blues (as she's since proven herself to be.  I imagine there were some aspects of the '80s ""fun"" that Cyndi may have come to regret.  In any event, the producers of this record should have kept the artwork from the original VHS edition, with the emphasis placed on Cyndi the SINGER).",1293753600,14,3598,4.600624024960998

4271016,4,B0046QK9TQ,"For the collector. Quality production values aren't that exceptional at all. Yet? If one desires to see The Queen of Soul in her prime with excellent vocal performances, and classic ""Ree Ree"" costuming? It's worth a peek!",1399593600,2,221,5.0

4271018,4,B0046QK9TQ,It was a nice surprise to find this available on dvd. I saw the VHS tape decades ago (makes me feel old saying this) and always wanted to own it. But to get it in VHS nowadays is over $150 new or $50 used (who else besides me has a working vhs player?).. This dvd import was available at a lower price. It basically has the same quality of the original VHS format but I expected that. I like to watch it on a smaller screen old tube tv so everything really feels like an authentic 80's flashback. Great concert. Terrific band and great compilation of Cyndi Lauper  tunes.,1383350400,,571,4.238532110091743

4271020,3,B0046QK9TQ,"The performance was ok, and her voice sounds very good. I just did not like how it was formated not showing the audiance. I don't rate this as a bad concert other then that.",1362787200,,173,4.117647058823529
4271021,4,B0046QK9TQ,"You know the 2 people that rated this didn't even listen to Aretha! I am listening to it without watching and I can say the audio it kinda hashed but listening to Aretha do songs from other divas and others that r foreign to me is awesome. I have to say the highlight is Dr. Feelgood! Aretha tears that song up! I love the adlibs at the end very Gospel feel!
I think that when Aretha leaves this world to join The One, people are going to b ordering this just to see and hear her again!
I love this DVD and good to praise Our Queen Of Soul while she is still here with us! I love u Aretha! You have inspired, encouraged and enlightened my life!",1352073600,3,644,4.0390625
8417410,1,B0046QK9TQ,"Aretha's live shows have always been HIT or MISS.  this was a MISS for sure.  to  travel to Paris and give such a lousy performance is unforgivable.
It was during the height of her career and she had several hits under her belt that she should have been hailed as the black Edith Piaf.
Instead she sang other singers songs instead of her own soul stirring ballads which for which she earned her crown.  In the recording studio she reigns Supreme in concerts I guess it's according to her mood at that time.",1523836800,,506,4.408602150537634

8417413,3,B0046QK9TQ,"Cyndi Lauper can give really great concerts, and this is one of them.  I just don't understand why the video source material couldn't have been better.  The quality of the video is really not up to the DVD standard; it looks more like a bad VHS recording (and I don't even mean S-VHS).  It's interesting how people remember her for her quirky little girl persona, but I remember a concert she did at the Gothic in Denver (pretty small venue) in which she skipped the shtick and just gave one bad-ass performance - this woman can sing!!  It was around the time of her 'Hat Full Of Stars' CD coming out.  I really wish that concert was filmed too.",1423958400,3,645,4.38655462184874

8417416,4,B0046QK9TQ,"Was waiting to see this program for a while! At Last... I seen this. It was what I was expecting.

First, the video footage and quality is not the best, but it was filmed years and years and years ago, and filmed probably not on top equiptment and cameras, but, the show was about one hour and a half.

The songs kept on going, and they were very well done live by Cyndi! The songs mostly consisted of ""True Colors"" album songs, but this tour was of the ""True Colors"" era, so can't complain. And in between the songs, Cyndi talked to introduce the next coming song to sing, and not much, as she probably was a little quiet or not too much in to talking publicly, but when she did, she cracked me up in bits! When she was having fun, she giggled and smiled and talked! It was fun to watch.

Although, the price might be high, I was aware also... this show is pretty ""rare"", and to the average Cyndi Fan, (Us Cyndi Fans, are not just ... Fans, we know we are Cyndi F A N S!, we know what grade quality fans we are!) (You got to be a Cyndi Fan to understand it!) But, if you are a cyndi Fan, go for it and you will enjoy it watching after watching! I guarantee it.",1420675200,2,1161,4.039130434782609
