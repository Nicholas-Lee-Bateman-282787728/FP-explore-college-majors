8434337,5,B004LGIFI8,"One of the few dramas out there that doesn't make me want to pull my hair out. Honest acting and emotions, this series really made me feel for all of the characters and none of the characters were unbelievable, like in some other dramas. Everyone felt like honest & real people and there were no cheap plots to cause pointless drama. The scenarios were very relatable and understandable, even if sad or frustrating to watch. Very touching and earnest series from a genre rife with forgettable and stupid entries, this series is a favorite of mine and happily added to my collection.",1466726400,,582,4.715686274509804
8434338,4,B004LGIFI8,"The DVD quality is good, the subtitles are clear and accurate. The story is a bit melo but the actors are wonderful and they pull off the sometimes insane story lines very well. The character of Risa's brother I feel is totally unnecessary and is so unlikeable the drama suffers when he's around. I literally just fast forward through his parts. We could of had the same story without his character. Basically the main guy is preparing for his wedding when his sister who has an illness suddenly gets worse. Neither he or his mother are good candidates for a liver transplant so his mom asks his fiancee who flees at the possibility of surgery. The main guy meets the Risa ( main girl) through his job at the aquarium. When he learns of her blood type he asks her to enter into a contract marriage so she can be a donor for his sister. They need to be married due to the strict donation laws in Japan. He agrees to pay her debt so she can leave her massage parlor job. Since he pays her debt it appears that he is buying her liver, which is against the law. Overall the story is good just skip the brother portions, it won't change the story.",1456617600,,1142,4.316279069767442
