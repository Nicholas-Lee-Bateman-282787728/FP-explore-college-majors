8750821,5,B01BN8UNKY,"I really like this episode because it has surprises all the way to the end of the episode.  The Greene family help in ways that they would not believe if they did not believe in angels and the power of how God can work in the lives of people.  One woman on death row learns to forgive and once she does she can be forgiven.  Also a another woman learns that anger, bitterness and revenge are more destructive, time consuming and dangerous than forgiving and moving forward.  One of the Greene family leaves the country running from the past but ultimately the past catches up to everyone involved and lives are changed forever especially when forgiveness is granted.",1464739200,4,666,4.61864406779661
