If you are a devotee of the Golden Age of Hollywood and the actors and actresses of the period, or of Mrs. Garland herself, you simply must get this. The first section at the Pantages premiere is enjoyable with the exception of occasional mumblings of the names of the guests on the part of the announcers. At one point, a lady who looked like Elizabeth Taylor was presented but I never heard her name; I may have heard, "" Mrs. Micheal Wilding"".  But she looked very like Mrs. Taylor, so I wonder.....
  The second part I enjoyed even more. Candid video of many of the actors/actresses of the period out and about, street scenes, motorcars, the Ambassador Hotel....for enthusiasts of the Golden Age of Hollywood or of the first half of the twentieth century - things like this are bliss. Quality of the images and audio is very good with occasional overexposure of some outside pictures.",1255478400,,981,4.594285714285714
7878312,5,6304749139,"This video is really two programs for the price of one, both featuring the legendary Judy Garland!
First up is a special treat for those of us who love to look back at the ""old days"" of Hollywood!  It offers up some original footage of the premiere of Judy's great motion picture ""A Star Is Born"", circa September 1954!  We get to see lots and lots of famous (albeit younger) faces as they file by the camera before entering the famed Pantages theatre for the premiere.  Lots of nostalgic fun!
Second, we're treated to some of Ken Murray's ""home movies"".  Miss Garland is by Ken's side (as a sort of co-host here) as we look at several decades' worth of images featuring many of Hollywood's biggest stars, including some of Judy herself.
Running time is 58 minutes for this VHS video.",1007337600,2,784,4.539007092198582
7878313,4,6304749139,"What is the most interesting thing about this video is how fake all the celebraties, besides Judy were.  No wonder she didn't get her academy award, given the obvious jealousy that surrounded her.",957916800,2,196,4.9393939393939394
7878314,2,6304749139,"The prior customer comments pretty much sums it up. Garland was known to be quite witty, or could be when she felt comfortable enough. Clearly, she wasn't up to it when forced to endure Ken Murray's rather self-serving  ""Hollywood Home Movies.""
And that long, boring ""Star is  Born"" premiere! Please! Very little is revealed here, except that  Greer Garson comes across as a self-aggrandizing boor when she gets her  turn at the podium.",934243200,,436,4.931506849315069
