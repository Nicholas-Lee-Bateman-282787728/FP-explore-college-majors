5019889,5,B006UF2688,"I bought this item and have been enjoying it for several weeks now. In order to view this on an American tv set you must have a region free DVD player. I have one. I cannot understand why this is an issue, for it is clearly stated in the product info that these DVDs are recorded for PAL tv sets. If you don't have a region free player then don't buy this, period. Anyway, on to the discs. Each year has its own well-constructed plastic box with snap in slots for the individual discs. The titles are clearly written on each disc and all four seasons come in a cardboard slipcover with a small booklet about the series. Very nicely done, especially when compared with some of the Paramount ST;TNG and ST;Voyager releases which have virtually nothing in the way of disc info. The images on the discs themselves are very good. The first season was shot in b/w and is slightly grainy, but the color years are fine. The shows themselves have the nuclear-powered submarine Seaview travelling around the world encountering odd (and usually science fiction related) problems. Richard Basehart and David Hedison are in fine form and the shows are usually entertaining. This series never caught on in the way Star Trek did, but was still ahead of its time. All four seasons for a very reasonable price. If you like good episodic science fiction tv and have the right kind of DVD player then by all means by this!",1364428800,21,1403,4.571428571428571

5019891,1,B006UF2688,"This item should not have been displayed on Amazon USA since it works only on European PAL devices. Even if the small print states so, I assumed it was advertized for a USA customer like me. It was a costly mistake ($38 to ship it back to the UK)!",1356307200,8,247,4.061224489795919
5019892,5,B006UF2688,"Id heard of Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea but never watched it before.  I m a fan of the first season of Lost In Space so I thought Id give Voyage a chanceand Im glad I did.  Ive watch all episodes expected for Season Four V1 &V2 (I purchased each season individually because I wasn't sure if wed like the show).

So far the first season is the best.  It has a more of serious tone; or maybe a better description is that the story lines were (relatively speaking) believable.  They mostly focused on nefarious characters from other countries making attempts to take over the world or steal government secrets while the crew of the Seaview fought to stop them.  The subsequent seasons focused more on creatures from the sea and from outer space -- clearly science fiction stuff (very much like Lost In Space).

Seasons 2 and beyond are fun to watch, despite being very predictable and repetitive story lines.  I found it amazing that there were quite a few editing mistakes.  For example, inadvertently showing camera close ups of stuntmen during fight scenes who were supposed to be the main characters fighting an adversary; 3 men shown in the flying-submarine, but four men exiting it when it landed; a cast member killed in one episodes and the same cast member returning in the next episode.  It doesnt destroy the enjoyment of the show, in fact it became a game for us to spot the editing boo boos!

The version of the disc I purchased did not have a play-all function (each episode has to be selected separately) and the disc are dual-sided -- two features that I don't like.

I would definitely recommend Voyage because despite its flaws (predictable and repetitive storylines) it is good clean viewing and fun to watch.  The added bonus is Richard Hedison (Captain Crane) who was quite a handsome man.  His good looks made watching the show even more enjoyable!",1499472000,,1871,4.64741641337386

5019900,4,B006UF2688,"I do not own this set so I leave it to others to comment on physical product quality.

As to the series, this is a great example of Science Fiction TV of its era.  But it is also a great example of production quality bad-ness that can occur when no one is worrying about it.  Don't get me wrong.  I have watched every episode over the last several months and have enjoyed them very much.  But there a few things to say negative about it all.

1. Though great scifi for its era, it is not always great science.  Consider one of the later season episodes in which the antarctica ocean has its temperature raised to 150F or so from an experiment gone bad.  The amount of energy needed to actually make this happen would be around the same as 13 million bombs like those dropped on Japan.  OK so kids won't care.  The scripts were written to make it easy to see the ""danger"" and ""resolution"" when it happens but jeesh.

2. You get tired somewhere between season 2 and season 3 of air bubbles and rocking, and how many time the Circuitry Room can be wrecked, and how susceptible human brains are to mind control, and how easy sparks and fire jump of equipment panels when anything hits the ship.

3.  Seems quite expensive compared to other scifi series of the same era.

That said, I enjoyed them.  Indeed I enjoy them much more than much of the junk tv pushed around today.",1472256000,,1370,4.317647058823529
5019901,3,B006UF2688,"""VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA"" was a classic ABC science fiction series that aired from 1964 to 1968,and was also based on Twentieth Century Fox's 1961 motion picture of the same name,that was produced and directed by Irwin Allen. the series was popular on ABC's Sunday evenings,following ""THE FBI"" and ""The ABC SUNDAY NIGHT MOVIE"",and the series made an impressive impact with many devout TV viewers! when the series made it's Sept 1964 debut,ABC originally aired the show on Monday nights' 7-8PM timeslot,that was vacated by ""THE OUTER LIMITS"",which ABC unwisely moved to Saturday nights,where it met its ratings demise by CBS's ""JACKIE GLEASON"" series! of the 110 episodes of this 20th Century Fox/Irwin Allen series,Richard Basehart and David Hedison sailed the seven seas,on board the futuristic nuclear powered submarine of the future,The Seaview,with its glass like windows,and its sleek Manta Ray looking body! 20th Century Fox's SPFX man,L.B.Abbott and his crew,labored expertly in making this series look extremely visual and realistic,since some three to four models of The Seaview were used in effective FX shots,while Abbott's technical crew filmed the amazing underwater effects in the now defunct Fox moat,which was eventually destroyed for real estate development years after the show ended (replaced by another Irwin Allen series,""LAND OF THE GIANTS"" in Fall 1968!) the series also won an Emmy award for its SPFX from the second season episode,""Jonah and The Whale"",which,like ""LOST IN SPACE"",had borrowed the ""FANTASTIC VOYAGE"" set,to shoot what was the inside of the massive sperm whale,that swallowed the Diving Bell! but another popular machine that was also used in the second season (1965-66) was the debut of ""The Flying Sub"",that functioned as both a supersonic jet aircraft,and a submersival vessel underwater! in the series' color episodes,the show also used a large variety of aliens and creatures,which were also used on ""LOST IN SPACE"",being another top Irwin Allen creation! i can go on and on,and that's a pretty boring drivel,so i'll simply say that this series is a true science fiction classic,for viewers to enjoy,for generations to follow!  but the real letdown here,is that the studio (20th Fox) had put these episodes onto these cheap,flawed Multi-Disc DVDs with the two sides,as the video clitches were heavily discovered during playback,,and that is so seriously insulting! it is also hoped that Twentieth Century Fox will eventually correct these sad imperfections,since their previous BluRay release of ""LOST IN SPACE"" was highly and professionally made,and rewarding! their decisions to produce their materials onto these cheap discs,should've started a huge boycott,because that was so unfair and insulting to deserving consumers! MGM/20th Fox also did this to ""THE TIME TUNNEL"" and the ""LAND OF THE GIANTS"" DVDs-they also did this with ""THE OUTER LIMITS"" when the original series was released on DVD in 2002,and it was such a serious let down! but the bottom line here,,is that ""VOYAGE"" deserved a better DVD set,for serious consumers,who want quality product,for the money that they pay for! hope MGM/Fox fixes this problem,and soon!",1469577600,5,3183,5.37875751503006

5019907,3,B006UF2688,"I would say it is quite a good series, and would recommend it. It is actually a childrens show, although many adults did watch. The series is not just about undersea adventures. Similar series I would say are Stingray and seaQuest.

It is a pity that the first season is in black and white. But, oh well. That is also like for instance Lost in Space, where the first season is in black and white and the rest in color. It should be colourized, so that its the same as the rest. Im in favor of colourizing. There can also be the option to choose between them. An unaired pilot episode though is already in color, which is included.

The idea for the series (1964  8) came from the feature film (1961). This box set should have included it. It can for instance be on the last disc of the episodes of the fourth season.

In the first season the submarine has two rows of windows. But, only shows one floor, being one observation lounge at the windows. From the second season the submarine has one row. In some scenes it has two rows, being stock cells.

In the episodes it is like they haven't had past experiences from previous episodes. Oh well, production and first broadcast orders aren't the same. But, theres still not having past experiences from previous seasons.

I wonder why this box set is limited edition. That is the same with Irwin Allens The Time Tunnel. Perhaps all of his are.

There is the possibility of the series returning. Hopefully it would not be like The Time Tunnel where only the pilot episode was made, and then the series abandoned. This time can allow for the passage of time, instead of a new series. The submarine can come out of mothball storage, so to speak. It gets overalled and upgraded inside. The outside only has this for what the windows are made of. There can also be the flying sub only having an upgraded dashboard. The Admirals duties can be divided between the Captain and another man, thus not having an Admiral. There can be Captain Lee Nelson, a descendant. It would probably have to include at least a few women and African Americans in the crew. Perhaps in the upgrade the submarine was cut in half and extended, to for instance include a womens cabin or cabins.",1449273600,2,2211,4.485074626865671
