The rubber bands have softened due to age.",1439856000,,115,4.523809523809524

7956907,5,B00005Y7NZ,"I do this DVD at least 2 days a week and at first I thought it was relatively easy, but as I continue to do it, I've learned how to breath, and really control my motions and moves.  I have seen great results and my core continues to get stronger.  I am pretty picky about how instructors queu and Ana has an excellent way of ensuring you are qeued at the right time.  I am now looking for another band workout to come out.  I hope she'll have another one soon!  Try it.  This is for all levels!",1150243200,,494,3.989795918367347
7956908,5,B00005Y7NZ,I found the body bands to be exactly what I needed in my Pilates workout.  I am able to choose the degree of resistance and know that the bands will do exactly what I need them to do.  My workout is so much more refined and specific to my personal needs...thanks to the BodyBand Workout Kit and my own perserverence.,1140652800,,316,4.25
7956909,5,B00005Y7NZ,"I hate to exercise and now that I am pregnant again, I am trying to start with something relatively easy. I bought this tape sometime after my 1st child, and the only reason I stopped is b/c getting in the habit of exercising is hard for me.  This is relatively easy and actually quite relaxing.  There are 3 levels of bands, which is very nice.  I had a little trouble finagling the bands at first, but it gets easy quickly.  I could tell right away that if I stick with this, it will strengthen and tone my muscles.  And I think as I move to higher levels of resistance, I will see more improvements.  As a pregnant woman, I can do almost every exercise.  There a couple that are hard to do and some belly ones that I can't do.  The video is short, but that is good for someone who hates to exercise.  It is not very cardiovascular FYI - at least not with the beginner band.",1059523200,2,876,4.166666666666667
7956910,4,B00005Y7NZ,"You get three good-quality bands of varying resistance in this kit, and they definitely add some oomph to your workout, with quicker firming and sculpting benefits, and (for me) less injury than using weights. The video is ok--not great. The arm workout is good, but the legs/hips portion is pathetically short. You might want to also invest in the Stott Pilates Flex-Band Workout video for a more complete workout.",1058140800,7,415,5.028985507246377
