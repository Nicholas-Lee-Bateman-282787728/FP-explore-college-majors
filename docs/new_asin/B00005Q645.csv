1648631,4,B00005Q645,"While this is very informative and gives a lot of background information it is not the movie.  I purchased it for a friend who was so excited to get it until she found out I had purchased basically a documentary about the people of the movie and the sport.  She liked it for the great details but I ended up going back on and purchasing her the actual movie.  If that's what you're looking for, this isn't it.",1391731200,2,409,4.217948717948718
1648632,5,B00005Q645,this is the best show to take a break on the weekend to watch. it is funny the music is great if you are a kid of the seventies and just great all around fun,1388966400,,157,3.5142857142857142
1648633,5,B00005Q645,It was a gift for a friend of mine and I hope it contains the original Bruce Brown film.  I haven't hear back so I assume it was all it was meant to be.,1372377600,,152,3.4705882352941178
1648634,4,B00005Q645,"This is kind of a nostalgic look back at the making of Bruce Brown's original documentary, which has become a classic to off-road motorcyclists.  Shot thirty years later, this one has a good bit of footage from the earlier one, but is still appealing because it features interviews with Bruce Brown and Malcolm Smilth and some of the current great riders who were just kids when the original film came out and inspired so many to ride.",1359936000,,435,4.64935064935065

1648636,3,B00005Q645,"How many times are we going to ""revisit""?? I like On Any Sunday,I understand this is footage not seen before along with interviews and how riders and people were influenced,But there is nothing much to add to On Any Sunday already.",1303084800,,231,4.658536585365853
1648637,1,B00005Q645,This movie was purchased for me by my wife who thought she was getting the real thing.  This is strictly a for profit use of the title of a FABULOUS motion picture.  It might be able to stand on it's own if it had been presented and explained as a collection of old film that has been re-cut and reedited and then repackaged using a famous title in the hopes that people will buy it not realizing the difference.  I put the film in this morning with great anticipation - my wife joined me to watch the film I have talked about so much - and then she actually cried when she realized that this was just a great titled rip off to separate people like her from their money.  I am sure that those who made this POC are laughing all the way to the bank!,1230249600,7,748,4.068027210884353
1648638,3,B00005Q645,"I loved the original ""On Any Sunday"", and these other two installments were generally put together by Bruce Brown's Son Dana Brown.  Dana generally edited some older footage not used in the original.  One of my issues with this is the subtitling.  Appears it was put together on Microsoft Front Page.  The music on these are rather pityful and it gets generally annoying as the film progresses.  I think Dana should probably begin doing some things on his own witout re-hashing bits of his fathers work.",1113004800,5,503,4.8023255813953485
