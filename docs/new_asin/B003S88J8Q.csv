Brian Kendrick vs. Roderick Strong - 8:10 3/5
MVP vs. Ryze - 6:27 2/5
Rainman vs. Sal Rinauro vs. Jared Steel vs. Kahagas
Dunn vs. Eddie Vegas 12:22 - 2/5
Jarelle Clark vs. Jimmy Rave 10:44 - 4/5
Carnage Crew/Marcos vs. Heartbreak Express/Don Juan - 14:09 - 5/5
Jamie Noble vs. Steve Madison 10:54 - 2/5
Homicide vs. CM Punk 16:12 - 5/5

Positives:
*MVP dominates!
*Dave Prazak's involvement in the Rave vs. Clark match
*The six man tag match is created because one team likes to eat potato chips, drink beer, and watch tv, can't find a more awesome way to create a 6-man tag than that lol
*Homicide rips off Hulk Hogan! you can't find more awesomeness than that

Negatives:
*Some promos are cut out (badly I might ad)
*It jumps from match to match to match without any breaks, obviously cut for time (The dvd is 1 hour, and 47 mins)

The constant cuts from match to match are a pain, but regardless it's a good FIP show",1338163200,,1034,4.426315789473684
