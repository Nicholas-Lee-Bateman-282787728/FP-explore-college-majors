8514183,5,B007C3LRV4,This is a great opportunity for any fan to see what made the Beach Boys America's #1 band over the past 50 years. It features so many of their hits and is a worthwhile addition to any fan's collection.,1424995200,,201,4.17948717948718
8514184,4,B007C3LRV4,"Billy Hinsche has been associated with the Beach Boys for many years. During a 1974 tour he took his camcorder behind the scenes resulting in this `tour documentary` interspread with interviews with the participants. Not bad,but consider:there`s very little actual performance of songs and not much with the `front line members`.Most of the footage is contained to the other sideman and behind the scenes people. This leaves the viewer wanting more material on the four Beach Boys,i.e. Al,Carl,& Mike(Dennis Wilson seems featured more than the other 3,and even mugs for the camera)...The hard core fan might enjoy this production but how many casual fans dig the sidemen checking into hotels,doing soundchecks,and climbing on and off their jet charter,and clowning in the hotel??Savory,but only for Beach Boy super fans.",1393459200,2,820,5.4140625
8514185,5,B007C3LRV4,"This is a fascinating peak behind the curtain of a road tour by The Beach Boys during their acclaimed 1974 concert season.  This is a glimpse of the band, still together, still working hard, on the cusp of their massive 1970s comeback, just a few weeks before the release of Capitol's ENDLESS SUMMER collection.  All the humor, drama and history in what is essentially the ""real"" story behind films that document that era like ALMOST FAMOUS.  The footasge comes from longtime Beach Boys band member Billy Hinsche, who shot the material on primitive black and white ""porta-pak"" reel to reel tape during the Beach Boys spring 1974 tour.  Thought lost for decades, the material was discovered by Hinsche and digitally restored for this DVD release.  Note:  While some in concert footage is included, this is not a concert film.  This is up close and in depth material, a you-are-there journey with the Beach Boys, on the planes, in the cars and back stage, rehearsals, conversations, and parties with Carl Wilson, Dennis Wilson, Mike Love, Al Jardine and Ricky Fataar, as well as Van Dyke Parks and other celebrities.  It also includes interviews with the musicians who were there.",1381795200,7,1178,4.914141414141414
8514186,1,B007C3LRV4,".......poor excuse of a Beach Boys live experience.  It was not promoted as a biography (more of a film revue of live performances).
I was so put off; I didn't even finish watching it.  I threw it in the trash!!!!!!!!!!",1371600000,4,219,4.45
