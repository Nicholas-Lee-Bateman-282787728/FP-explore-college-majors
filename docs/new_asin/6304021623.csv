759165,5,6304021623,"I thoroughly enjoyed this WW II movie, it has action, drama and a good plot.  I am a recent devotee of WW II movies and this is as good as 5 graves to Cairo, the Enemy Below and The Train in my estimation.  (I also enjoyed The Dessert Rats, The 49th Parallel and  The Story of Dr Wassell.)  I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a movie of a time when courage and perseverance of men meant personal differences must be put aside-in order that a unified purpose be achieved.",1135900800,6,479,4.230769230769231

759464,4,6304021623,"RED BALL EXPRESS is a black and white film from 1952.  The movie takes place in France, and concerns a U.S. truck convoy that has the goal of transmitting gasoline to General Patton's tanks.  As such, the movie can be considered a ""road story."" The movie does display good timing and some intelligent dialogue.  At one point, mid-level officers are discussing the incompetance of the soldiers who are driving the trucks in the convoy.  In the background, we see the convoy of trucks driving down a muddy road, and we see one army truck crashing (at low speed) into the rear of another army truck.  This is an intelligent presentation of good timing, as far as cinematography is concerned.

If you are interested in a high-tech movie about World War II, such as RUN SILENT, RUN DEEP (Bert Lancaster), or BEDFORD INCIDENT (Richard Widmark), then you need to look elsewhere.  While RED BALL EXPRESS does show army tanks driving around, most of what we see is the convoy of trucks.  There is some excitement towards the end, when the convoy of trucks carrying cannisters filled with gasoline speeds through a flaming town.  But this is not quite the same thing as the hardware displayed in the above-mentioned movies, or in, for example, BATTLE OF BRITAIN (starring Suzanna York).

HISTORY.  The following discloses the real-life aspects of the film, summarized from Wiki: ""The Red Ball Express was an enormous truck convoy created by U.S. army to supply their forward-area combat units moving quickly through Europe following the breakout from the D-Day beaches in Normandy. The route was marked with red balls and closed to civilian traffic while the trucks were given priority when on regular roads. The Red Ball Express supply plan originated in a 36 hour urgent meeting, and was cdesigned by Lt. John Bridener Guthrie, Jr.  The system lasted only three months (August 25 to November 16, 1944) when the port facilities at Antwerp, Belgium were opened.  The Red Ball Express was primarily operated and driven by African-American soldiers.""  Part of the dialogue in the movie tells us that the term ""Red Ball Express"" is a railroading term.

JEFF CHANDER.  The actors include JEFF CHANDLER (1918-1961), a famous handsome actor from the 1950s.  He plays the commanding officer in the convoy (Lt. Campbell). He stared in BROKEN ARROW, BATTLE OF APACHE PASS, FLAME OF ARABY, TWO FLAGS WEST, AWAY ALL BOATS, DRANGO, TOY TIGER, THUNDER IN THE SUN, and others.  His biography, again from Wiki, tells us that he specialized in parts that were Indians, Arabs, and such.  His bio states that he was Jewish.

EDDIE DEEZEN-TYPE NERD.  RED BALL EXPRESS also features actor Frank Chase, who plays a character named ""Higgins.""  The dialogue and voice inflections of Higgins is nerdy.  The dialogue and tone-of-voice of Higgins is like that of Eddie Deezen, who played a memorable and engaging nerd in Steven Spielberg's movie, 1941. The viewer of this film will be treated to about a dozen little episodes where Frank Chase contributes nuggets of nerdiness to the dialogue.

The following summarizes a bio that was written by journalist, Bruce Eder: ""Character actor Frank Chase appeared in two dozen movies during the 1950s, ranging from Westerns to science fiction, and also enjoyed a career as a TV screenwriter.  He was the son of veteran author and screenwriter Borden Chase. Frank's animated persona made him ideal for portraying comical eccentrics, though he could also play straight, non-comedic roles. He appeared in Winchester '73, Red Ball Express, and Walk the Proud Land, though his most memorable work on the big screen was in Nathan Juran's Attack of the 50 Foot Woman (1958).""

SIDNEY POITIER is also one of the actors, and this movie features three African-American actors.  He was about 25 years old during the time of filming.  Mr. Poitier plays Corporal Robertson, who exhibits a reasonable paranoia for being a victim of racism.  He feels that he is being mistreated and requests a transfer from the outfit.  In an early scene in this movie, a soldier makes a degrading remark about minstrel shows.  Mr. Poitier is quick to take offense, and another black soldier immediately reassures Mr. Poiter that ""he didn't mean nothing.""  Mr. Poitier quickly withdraws from being engaged in this incident, but the viewer can tell that he is busy building a grudge.

But about 30 minutes or so later into the movie, another of the African-American soldiers is killed by a mine while driving a truck. JEFF CHANDLER arranges for a funeral with prayers to be held by the roadside.  A senior officer approaches, and tells the crowd of soldiers attending the makeshift funeral to break it up, and to return to the convoy.  JEFF CHANDLER refuses to stop the ceremony, and gently states, ""You can court martial me if you want to.""  The senior officer agrees to allow the funeral to continue, and he quietly adds, ""You can easily make up for the lost time.""  African-American issues are a recurring theme in this movie.  This episode turned the tide in Sidney Poitier's desire for a transfer to another outfit.

NEGRO SPIRITUALS.  While lifting gas cans and other supplies on the convoy trucks, and when unloading, the black soldiers and the white soldiers sing a song.  The song is in the form of a negro spiritual, which helps them keep their mind on their work.  The song goes like this, ""LIFT AND LOAD, LIFT AND LOAD.  ONE FOR HITLER AND ONE FOR THE ROAD.""  The movie is peppered with dated subject-matter of this type, and this probably contributes to the fact that the movie is now forgotten.  The comedy is corny, but not as corny and stupid as that found in contemporary movies with JIM CAREY,  CHRIS FARLEY, and DAVID SPADE.  The comedy in RED BALL EXPRESS seems to work for the most part, but it is B-grade comedy.  But in my opinion, the comedy in Jim Carey's movies is not even comedy -- it is an annoyance.

UNLIKELY SUB-PLOT.  Another actor is of note, namely JACQUELINE DUVAL.  She was 20 years old at the time of filming.  She is slender, has dimples, a pair of big eyes, and a pair of very big something else.  Anyway, her role in this film is that of a subplot.  The subplot is rather unlikely, in that during the convoy, one of the truck drives abandons the convoy and encounters Miss Duval, and engages in conversation.  She only speaks French.  The man speaks only English.  After walking together towards a rural cottage, Miss Duval exclaims, ""Shove off.""  The man then realizes that Ms. Duval knows some English, and so they spend the next 20 minutes conversing in English, making light comedy.  The man borrows Ms. Duval's bicycle and promises to return with food, and then he catches up with the rest of the convoy on the bicycle.  However, during the course of the unlikely storyline of this movie, the man decides to become a KAMIKAZE TRUCK DRIVER, and he drives his truck (filled with gasoline canisters) into a German tank that was blocking the road, thereby giving the rest of the convoy access to the road in front of them.  Eventually, when the convoy returns on the same road, they encounter the man at the Ms. Duval's home.  (It was the case that the man had jumped off of his truck during the kamizake mission.)

CONCLUSION.  RED BALL EXPRESS has a fine dialogue, sometimes comedic, and often didactic.  Although the subplot of the on-the-fly romance seems unlikely, there does exist another very excellent movie from the WWII era which features an on-the-fly romance.  This is THE BIG LIFT, featuring Montgomery Clift.  THE BIG LIFT is an excellent teaching device for human nature, and I recommend it to any person from the ages ten to 100.  But RED BALL EXPRESS is somewhat light in weight by comparison.  RED BALL EXPRESS is never boring and the plot never drags.",1354406400,8,7788,4.817633760361718

759466,5,6304021623,"Great movie. Saw it first in about 1954.  First time I have seen it since. I have been searching for the DVD version for some time.  I have since learned a lot of WWII history as it relates to two of my uncles.  I was about 8 years old when they returned from the war. I remember very clearly that my oldest uncle had a Black Panther (761st Tank Battalion) shoulder patch on his uniform.  I also remember them talking about meeting in France.  They were African American and I have recently connected the dots.  One was a tank commander attached to Gen Patton's tankers (761st) and the other was assigned to the 3439 Quartermaster Truck Company, (which was assigned to the Red Ball Express). Considering, that the roles of African Americans in WWII was almost non-existent in movies in those days, I remember the pride I felt seeing the movie with Blacks playing important roles alongside white actors (first movie I saw starring Sidney Poitier).  I always admired Jeff Chandler for his role because I felt white actors did not want roles that showed blacks as equals.  I spent 38 years in the military (3 years Army and 35 years Air Force.  I have always felt the pride I felt when my uncles returned home and how well they looked in their uniforms was the primary motivating factor in me choosing to devote the major portion of my life to the military.  I was not disappointed!",1348444800,6,1379,4.5465587044534415
759467,2,6304021623,"The cassette worked well in the machine, but the actual movie was poor. The movie was historically inaccurate and the acting was amaturish. I'm glad I bought it, however. My father was in the Red Ball Express during WWII. I feel like I have a souvenir.",1322956800,,252,4.5

759469,2,6304021623,"This DVD was not professionally produced.  There are annoying skips throughout the movie, probably where it was paused to skip through the commercials.  As the end credits roll a female voice with a British accent
talks about how the viewers can catch more of Sidney Poitier on another channel.",1312243200,7,294,4.979591836734694
759470,5,6304021623,"The search started from looking for an old TV sitcon series called ""Rollout!"".
The actual Red Ball Express was formed mostly of Black soldiers & the only assignment was to get supplies & especially fuel to the fighting front lines. They were to have an uninterrupted convoy of trucks identified only with a bright red ball marking on the front of the vehicle; hence the name ""Red Ball Express"". Excellent movie. The TV series had numerous comedic situations. Still looking for the series; if you find it, please let me know. Thanks.",1295308800,3,532,4.793478260869565

My mother is Jaqueline Duval, the French girl with the bicycle, and as I was told later, she was pregnant with me during the filming.

A good film, not ""great"", but definitely related to factual events.
