8314037,5,B000SQFBYG,"This set of 30-min DVDs is perfect for baby's first video experience - Animation interspersed with real children, real toys, real animals - short scenes appropriate for baby's attention span. Each of the 4 videos is built around a different ""lesson"" - numbers, colors, shapes, and counting,but the teaching is almost subliminal. Catchy instrumentals throughout.  There are no annoying previews or ads to click through to get to the show, and the credits at the end are fun as they run through head shots of the children in the film and snapshots of the toys used. My 2-yr old's favorite is ""Beach"" - I'd recommend that if you're planning on buying only one - colorful fish, playful dolphins, sand toys.",1318982400,,702,4.85
