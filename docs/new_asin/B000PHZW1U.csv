2822750,5,B000PHZW1U,"Meet the Last Chance Detectives, a group of friends who are Christians & have started their own detective agency: Mike - the leader. He holds the group together & looks out for cases to solve. Winnie - a full-blooded Navajo. If you have a question about Ambrosia, she can either give you the answer or find it out. She also knows the desert like the back of her hand. Spence - he's the brain of the group & is their computer & forensics expert - actually, it's hard to find something he's not an expert in! Ben - does a lot of the leg work...well, when he can be dragged away from his TV! Also the one with more imagination than the rest of them put together!

Mystery Lights of Navajo Mesa:

Mike talking about their detective agency says, ""Sure we're just kids & all, but sometimes we're the only hope for people with a mystery to solve."" Usually these mysteries are cats which have gone missing, or trying to find someone's missing dentures. Mike sums it up with, ""Man, don't we have anything good for a change!""

Sure enough, something happens. Their HQ is Mike's grandfather's old B-17 fighter plane which he lets them use. Spence has been trying to get the radio fixed in it. He figures it out, & to their surprise they hear some muffled voice speaking something they don't understand. (Ben thinks it could be aliens, but Spence informs him rather drily that the radio frequency isn't that long!) Winnie picks up a word ""Natani"" which in Navajo means ""Leader"" - it could be a person or a rock formation on the Mesa. So the detectives set out for the Mesa to do some investigating.

Then, just like buses, you don't have anything for a while then 2 come along. The museum has been robbed, but nobody knows how anybody got in or out. With the mystery lights at night out on the Mesa - & Ben convinced he's seen an alien spaceship - the detectives have their hands full, along with learning lessons of forgiveness on the way, little realising they have stumbled on a plot with international consequences.

A great fast-paced mystery our 10-13 year old group really enjoyed.

Legend of the Desert Bigfoot:

It's been called Sasquatch, Bigfoot, Mud Monster, Yeti & it was thought to be just a legend. Until now. Old Silas has a wild story about seeing it...& his gold has disappeared. A stranger's trailer has been overturned & it has claw marks over it. Some campers were terrified when it dropped in on them for supper. Mike has found some hair that could belong to the Bigfoot. The detectives have another mystery to solve, while also learning about integrity & about doing what's right, even when it's hard.

A good fast-paced adventure our 10-13 year old group really enjoyed.

Escape from Fire Lake:

Meet the Last Chance Detectives, a group of friends who are Christians & have started their own detective agency: Mike - the leader. He holds the group together & looks out for cases to solve. Winnie - a full-blooded Navajo. If you have a question about Ambrosia, she can either give you the answer or find it out. She also knows the desert like the back of her hand. Ben - he's the brain of the group & is their computer & forensics expert - actually, it's hard to find something he's not an expert in! Ben - does a lot of the leg work...well, when he can be dragged away from his TV! Also the one with more imagination than the rest of them put together!

The detectives are looking for a new mystery to solve. They decided to split up & search looking for anything that will give them a new case, making plans to meet up later - all the while behind them a bank robbery is going on!

Mike soon stumbles on the bank robbers though when his dog Jake's ball bounces into an old, closed up yard. At least, it's supposed to be closed up, but Mike spots 2 guys loading up a truck. Figuring they are up to something, Mike & Jake go in to investigate. Seeing bank sack in the back of the truck Mike knows he has to get Sheriff Smitty. However, the men come back out & there's only one place to hide - inside the truck. Mike decides to leave a trail of bank notes from the moving truck, writing on them to call the Sheriff. He also decides to put the jade figurine he's found in his pocket for evidence. The ""breadcrumbs"" leave a trail...one of which is spotted by the robbers. Not liking complications, they take Mike to Fire Lake & leave him there to find his way back. Now Mike & Jack just have to survive the wilderness while finding their way back.

The rest of the detectives meet back at HQ but are concerned when Mike doesn't turn up. Combing the streets they eventually find Mike's compass by the side of the road near the old yard. They discover Jake's ball in the yard & an abandoned car with Illinois plates - one that matches the description of the car used in the bank robbery. Then an old man stops by the diner with a $100 bill. Now they know which way they are headed, the Last Chance Detectives are on the trail...& to the rescue.

A great fast-paced adventure of survival, hope & courage, & where Mike realises how his personal faith in God makes all the difference during a crisis. Our 10-13 year old group really enjoyed this film.",1316476800,6,5154,4.4115789473684215

8191620,5,B000PHZW1U,"I saw this on VHS through our church when I was a child. When I was little, I really loved the one where he gets lost in the desert, and I was very much afraid of the Bigfoot one. Now that I'm older, I couldn't remember anything about them besides that. I wanted to take a trip down memory lane and see just what it was about these films that captivated me when I was little. Sometimes, re-watching films you saw when you were little can go very bad- it turns out either they're unavailable, or there were things about the films you don't remember that you don't approve of now. Also, was surprised that I was even able to find these films available anywhere, even online. Nobody else seems to have heard of them. So when I found them at this seller, I was a little suspicious and nervous about purchasing them. Didn't know if I would like them, or what kind of condition they would be in. Was very pleasantly surprised. They came in a handy box set, with all three of the movies I remembered. They looked BRAND NEW. Completely unopened and in pristine condition. I was expecting something that looked like it had been molding on a video store shelf for a couple of years/ After watching them, I realize what captivated me about them when I was little. Although the Bigfoot one isn't scary to me anymore, and I now am old enough to appreciate how well the movies were made, they're almost exactly as I remember them. I do not regret buying these at all, and I'm glad there's people who are willing to continue selling old gems like this.",1425340800,3,1537,4.3776223776223775
