8652346,5,B00JM5CC2I,"I sat glued to this movie for HOURS! (3.6 hours, actually.) I don't have the Discovery Channel, so I hadn't seen any of this footage before. There are 5 different segments titled: ""Air Jaws Apocalypse"", ""Shark Week's 25 Best Bites"", ""Shark Fight"", ""Adrift: 47 Days With Sharks"", and ""Great White Highway"".  ""Air Jaws Apocalypse"" features some stunning video and photography of sharks hurling themselves up out of the water as they attack seals. The researchers used innovative technology and cameras to capture the breathtaking shots. One 14-foot Great White named ""Colossus"" was featured quite a bit. In ""Shark Week's 25 Best Bites"", there were some very graphic images (some real, some reenacted) of shark attacks, but it also featured cutting-edge videography of sharks from years past. There are some redundant scenes from the ""Air Jaws Apocalypse"" segment, but I enjoyed them so much I didn't mind seeing them again. ""Shark Fight"" had some very engaging interviews with people who have been attacked by sharks. I had never seen any of these interviews before, and it was quite interesting to see how these people have recovered and how many of them are now working to protect sharks. ""Adrift: 47 Days With Sharks"" really isn't about sharks, although plenty of them were swimming around 3 men in inflatable rafts who had been in a plane crash during WWII. The survivors catch a shark and eat its liver (because they had been wrongly informed that the liver was the only part of a shark you could safely eat. I have eaten shark meat before - there are two nice rows of meat on either side of their spine you can eat. You are supposed to marinate the meat in milk overnight to get the urea out of it, which is a luxury these men understandably did not have...) It is a great survival story, but the sharks are just one element of it. ""Great White Highway"" was probably my favorite segment, because it features the latest scientific findings about Great Whites discovered by using satellite tags. Researchers can now track sharks as they migrate long distances in the ocean, and they can collect data on how deep and how often the sharks dive into the depths below. We apparently still have a lot to learn about Great Whites. I enjoyed this DVD immensely!",1410048000,13,2256,4.7846153846153845
