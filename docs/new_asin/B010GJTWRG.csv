8722442,4,B010GJTWRG,"This opera is about human emotions: love, jealousy, intrigue, and revenge....here ending in murder and suicide.  Such emotions are timeless, from the times that the libretto describes through the present.  No surprise then that transposing the staging to modern times makes some sense, although you should give some leeway to the lyrics.
The first and last act occur in a TV studio and the adjacent conference room.  I found them too crowded - full of equipment, computers, etc. - and believe the sets distract too much from the essence and the music. In addition, I had the feeling that by reducing the volume of the stage, the acoustics and the recording lost depth.  Act two and three, on the contrary, have a much simpler set - an exterior, and a window through which you can see inside an apartment.  I found it very effective and very well designed, simple and visually appealing. Given the non-traditional production, I would expect that some details on the stage concept would be included in the pamphlet, but I was disappointed. So much thought and investment into the staging, and not a single word to help us understand it!
The costumes seemed to be from the 60 or 70s, while the TV monitors on stage were very up to date, which I found confusing.
The most impressive aspects of this production are the singers and the orchestra.  The music is undoubtedly Russian; at times you can hear passages from Korsakovs previous operas. The internal struggles of the characters are beautifully put to music by the composer and rendered sublimely by the singers and the orchestra. Overall this was real treat, in particular since there are not many video recordings of the opera to enjoy.",1468713600,2,1689,4.826989619377162

8722444,5,B010GJTWRG,"I never complain about modern dress versions of classic plays or operas, since they're at least a chance to hold up an old masterpiece in a new light. Occasionally a more substantial remix adds some important insights. Very rarely the new concept takes on a life of its own and provides a satisfying theatrical experience in its own right. It happened for me with Ian McKellen and Richard Loncraines 1995 film of Richard III, set in an alternative fascist England. And its happened again with this production, in which Director Dmitri Tcherniakov has virtually re-written the story that underlies Rimsky-Korsakovs opera The Tsars Bride. The court of Ivan the Terrible is now a modern television studio, and the Czar has been replaced by a virtual character seen on big screens, put together with motion capture and green screen. You no longer need to know what a boyar is to appreciate the story, and the board room and television studio have replaced the court. But this isn't just about changing externals to make things more relevant to todays audience. The new dynamics of multi-nationals and media moguls are so close to the old ones of nations and monarchs. Its an arresting story in either case, with basic love/hate/jealousy geometry turned up to an operatic white-heat. The affairs of state and corporations, of media empires and real empires, matter less than the passions of individuals. Those passions are expressed in beautiful arias of longing, innocent love, betrayal and regret. In either reality, the music of Rimsky-Korsakov provides an enduring soundtrack thats always of interest whatever happens in the foreground. Nothing in the concept is especially subtle, but there are beautiful moments in the acting of the principals, sensitive movements of the camera to expose hidden emotions, and gorgeous singing and playing all around. Daniel Barenboim ensures the highest musical standards, and the beauties of the opera come to the fore.",1448668800,4,1955,5.150943396226415
8722445,5,B010GJTWRG,"Very specific conceptual updates such as this one -- a 16th-century bride search transplanted to a 21st-century reality-TV milieu, with Rimsky-Korsakov's oprichniki as television executives concocting an Orwellian distraction for the masses -- are risky. Usually there is a good deal the viewer has to hand-wave away as square pegs are hammered into round holes. Off the top of my head, I cannot remember ever seeing such an undertaking work better than this one does. Story elements from the libretto slide into place in the reimagining with precision, and the material is handled with insight by the director, sung and acted with vibrant emotion by cast members. Dmitri Tcherniakov rarely misses the target entirely in his opera work, and even his unsuccessful productions have had images and interpersonal direction that lingered and haunted. This is among his best work of my experience, making something audacious and compelling out of what sounds gimmicky at first blush.

The production was first given in Berlin in late 2013 (the DVD is taken from that premiere run) and subsequently traveled to Milan with only one significant cast change. Daniel Barenboim conducted in both cities, and the Staatskapelle Berlin on the DVD plays with brilliance if without the stylistic assurance that an ensemble with long experience in such music, led by a specialist in Russian opera, might have brought to it. In other words, this is ""internationalized"" playing on a high level.

There are two truly great performances here, several other good ones. The great work comes from baritone Johannes Martin Krnzle as the oprichnik Gryaznoy and mezzo-soprano Anita Rachvelishvili as Lyubasha, his mistress nearing her sell-by date and going to desperate measures in response. Lyubasha in the update becomes a young executive in Gryaznoy's production company, and their boardroom argument in the first act is highly charged, very physical. Krnzle acts the part of the aging, entitled power player with considerable skill and sings it artfully; Rachvelishvili delivers Lyubasha's music with stunning security and beauty of sound and throws herself into stage business with edgy ferocity. The mezzo also has a particular dark-lady charisma that is better exploited here than it was when she appeared in a CARMEN production at the Met with blocking and behavioral direction conceived for a very different-looking singer. The ovation she receives at the end is overwhelming, and well earned.

The title character, Marfa, desired by Gryaznoy and ultimately the ""lucky"" girl of the bride search, is well served too. But although soprano Olga Peretyako dispatches Marfa's music with technical poise, she lacks the force of personality in this rather vapid good-girl part to keep from being overshadowed by her romantic rival. Tenor Pavel Cernoch, as Marfa's intended, the young Lykov, seems to take time to warm up to best voice, but he sings most of his part more than adequately, and he and Peretyako sympathetically play these nave young people, seduced by Gryaznoy's corrupting world of mass media. Another mezzo, Anna Lapkovskaya, makes much of relatively little as Marfa's friend Dunyasha. Tenor Stephan Rgamer's Bomelius, the alchemist who provides a love potion to Gryaznoy and a death potion to Lyubasha, for the same intended recipient, is less contemptible than sad  a socially awkward, lonely drug dealer. In parental roles, there is veteran support from Anatoli Kotscherga and Anna Tomowa-Sintow. The former is vocally savvy and very much in the spirit of things; the latter has only the remains of a former Ada and Elsa voice but is very game, valiantly tackling her character's long narration in the third act.

I have no doubt that some will just shut down on this, but I don't see it as disrespectful of the Rimsky-Korsakov opera. Tcherniakov and his cast have done something bold and adventurous and they've preserved the spine of the story, what makes it echo through different periods, both on the larger thematic levels and in smaller moments of human drama. The production engages and entertains, it provokes thought, and it regards its characters with understanding and more than a little tenderness. A great show.",1445126400,14,4218,5.233727810650888
8722446,4,B010GJTWRG,"The positives first.  We finally get a Tsar's Bride DVD/BD in wide screen and surround sound.  It joins previous releases of Rimsky's Sadko (so far DVD only), Coq d'Or, and Kitezh in that respect.  The performances from conductor Barenboim, Martin Kr&auml;nzle's Gryaznoy, Anita Rachvelishvili's Lyubasha and Olga Peretyako's Marfa were mesmerizing.  In this opera the composer departed from his usual world of fantasy to explore human emotions like jealousy and revenge and he succeeded in producing a masterpiece comparable to Tosca which premiered about the same time as Tsar's Bride.

My reservations are about director Tcherniakov's modifications and modernization of the story.  I really never figured out how it all fit together.  During the overture, he had a bunch of TV executives (the updated secret police, the Oprichnik) decide to create a fantasy Tsar using software.  You also briefly see, early on, scenes of this opera with traditional scenery and costumes.  So you might think this was about the cast of a traditional performance going through a real life drama mirroring what is happening in the opera.  We have seen such things before like in the Met production of Sonnambula or the Dutch bluray of Norma.  However there was nothing later about such a conceit.  It was simply a modern dress, scenery performance of an opera.  Because of the hugely talented cast's ability to project emotions, this didn't bother me as much as it usually does.",1444521600,8,1462,5.1440677966101696
