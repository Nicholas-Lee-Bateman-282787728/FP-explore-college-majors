3628811,3,B001HBX91S,"This BD delivers excellent images and excellent sound. Some chapters are among the bests of the operas/ballets from which they are picked: the Gypsy Chorus from Trovatore, Habanera from Carmen. Others are just OK. But, for the cost, I would have given it 4 stars... if all the chapters played well!

But they did not! The first 4 chapters played fine, the last 3 played fine, but on the mid 6 chapters my player tried and tried and barely managed to produce some disjoint pictures (good quality stills - but just stills!) and no sound.

Clearly the disk was defective - as my player is a two-months-old Samsung BD-P1600 that has been working fine with several BDs since it arrived, not rejecting a single one. Defective disk, in spite of not showing any sign of scratch on its surface.

Surely you would say ""return the disk for a refund and buy another one"". Easier said than done... as I live in Brazil and the cost of shipping to here equals the cost of the disk. So I'd rather keep it as is, instead of discussing with Amazon for a refund of the price paid and of the shipping costs to here and back to the US.

If you live outside the US, think twice before ordering this BD, as you may be unlucky as I was. Or consider if just playing, let's say, 50% of it, it would still be worthy for you...",1245974400,5,1299,4.333333333333333
3628812,4,B001HBX91S,"Meant to be a showpiece of what is available on operatic and ballet Opus Arte BDs, I find this a mixed success and it did not entice me to buy the originals (although I have bought many, more inspite of, than because of, this disc).
However it is inexpensive so is worth the few dollars asked but I doubt if it would persuade anyone who is not interested in the genre to suddenly collect opera and ballet BDs.
That said it does illustrate the effectiveness of BD for showing opera and ballet and does include the brilliant (both technically and artistically) ""Queen of the Night"" aria from Mozart's ""magic Flute"" so the disc is worth the cost for this item alone.",1245542400,,663,4.487603305785124
3628813,5,B001HBX91S,"I'm going to be honest, I only purchased The Blu Ray Experience: Opera and Ballet Highlights because I wanted to test out my new blu-ray player and the price of the disc was very inexpensive but I was not disappointed. When they called this ""The Blu Ray Experience"", that was an understatement. The HD picture and sound quality of the video is phenomenal and really brings the performances to life. I feel like I was actually there. The acts were very enjoyable. The makers of this disc were sure to include many of the most popular opera and ballet performances that were familiar to even people like me who do not follow this type of entertainment as much. I still found this disc enjoyable and even though my blu-ray collection is growing, I still pop this disc in when I'm in the mood for some classical entertainment. The only thing I don't like about The Blu Ray Experience: Opera and Ballet Highlights is the fact that it's too short. If another 45 mins. to and hour were added, this disc would be perfect.",1242518400,4,1013,4.540983606557377
3628814,3,B001HBX91S,I was expecting a little more from this blu-ray. It's kinda short. The singing is good and the quality is good but this seems like it wasonly meant to be a demo disk.,1237593600,6,166,4.0606060606060606
3628815,3,B001HBX91S,"An appealing, tantalizing (that's the idea) collection of balletic and operatic chestuts, as professionally performed and smartly filmed as one might dare hope for.  BUT--there's a major caveat.  Many of the selections are awkwardly terminated at mid-chorus--in a couple of instances, simply a ""fade-out"" rather than anything resembling a cadence or final chord.  Whether a sampler such as this is more irritating than titillating to the neophyte Blu-Ray discoverer is perhaps a tough, highly personal call (reminds me of the first ""stereophonic"" recordings, with canons coming from two channels during the ""1812 Overture"" followed by ping-pong balls bouncing from one side of the room to the other and a parade of drummers soon to follow).

What irks me is that, despite the 13 excerpts, there's space for much more on the DVD, whether in the form of complete selections (preferably) or more of same.  Although these are not the international stars whose artistry and charisma enabled them to cross genre boundaries (a la Domingo and Pavarotti), each is good enough to make you wonder why the artist in question isn't a household word.  Perhaps the most absorbing, thoroughly delightful performance is the Cecilia & Bryn duet ""Pa-pa-pa-pa"" from Mozart's ""Die Zauberflote.""  There's only one other performer who strikes me as capable of equaling the performance included here: Danny Kaye.  (On the other hand, I defy Cecilia and/or Bryn to match Kaye on Cole Porter's ""Let's Not Talk About Love"" which, as performed by Kaye, is practically a toccata tour de force beyond the reach of anything human.)

All the same, a collection such as this should be going for no more than five bucks.",1236816000,56,1686,5.124087591240876

The price is low and the sound ""mind bending"". Here in Bandung Java Indonesia only few Blu-Ray discs are available, and there is no FTA terrestrial digital HDTV. My favourite track on this ""sampler"" DVD is from a Straus Opera....all tracks are absolutely beautiful. It is very tempting now to order the complete versions.

After watching the DVD, I found the video is very good, as expected. the pictures are very clear with HD. the Audio is not as good as I expected. I cannot tell different in sound between the Blu Ray DVD and regular DVD. This may be because the recording equipment or setup is not the best, or the lower sample rate was used.

3628828,5,B001HBX91S,"This is an interesting disc in several respects; the first one for me being the audio options available to the listener. On the opening screen one is given the option of choosing between PCM Stereo, PCM Surround, DTS-HD Master Audio and Dolby True HD Surround. That alone is worth the price of admission as it could help address the never-ending question about which audio format sounds best in your system. I am not personally aware of any other disc which provides this opportunity.

Moving on, the music and performances cover a wide variety from Puccini's comic opera ""Gianni Schicchi"" to the rather stilted and strange work by Rameau, ""Zoroastre."" A friend of mine who appreciates music has several times asked to hear this disc again, so it definitely exhibits a charm.

I'm a ballet fan and have a high level of respect for the Paris Opera Ballet, their selection from Act 2 of Swan Lake is beautifully done as I would have expected. I was a little surprised with the staging in the selection from Il Trovatore where in the famous ""Anvil Chorus"" scene they show some action with a prisoner being saved from being shot while the chorus is singing instead of the anvil scene with sparks flying.

On the whole there is more to like than to dislike and I'm glad I added it to my collection.",1270857600,11,1293,4.637554585152839

8308568,4,B001HBX91S,This is an entertaining mix of opera and ballet and introduced me to many singers I had not previously seen or heard. Of course the artistic quality varies a bit.

8308573,5,B001HBX91S,"Opus Arte has accomplished a masterful temptation with this short relatively inexpensive Blu-Ray collection of excerpts from several of the most favored classical performing works of opera and ballet. The Anvil Chorus from Il trovetore is beautifully done. The Swan Lake sequence is mesmerizing. Diana Damrau is absolutely menacing as Mozart's Queen of the Night and sings brilliantly. The tenor, Aquiles Machado, completely unknown to this reviewer, gives a lovely emotional reading of ""Che gelida manina"" in what appears to be a traditional setting of La Boheme. Why is this tenor unknown? Anne Sofie von Otter is a genuinely appropriately slutty Carmen with her ""Habanera"". Rise Stevens would have loved this giant leap forward. It has been said that the Pacific Northwest Ballet's production of A Midsummer Night's Dream is definitive and possibly the best that has ever been recorded. (See this reviewer's earlier review of the complete performance.) Felicity Palmer does an especially lovely ""O mio babbino caro"". The Die Fledermaus selection is delightful and naughty! Even the Rameau is pleasant. The ensemble from La Cenerentola is a frolic and fun to watch and hear. The ""Casta Diva"" of Hasmik Papian is well done, though you do not expect here a Callas, Caballe, or Sutherland. The Balanchine ""Jewels"" is lovely and pleasing. Closing this collection is an energetic and bouncy rendition of Mozart's ""Pa-Pa-Pa-Pa"" from Die Zauberflote by Cecilia Bartoli and Bryn Terfel from their DVD of Arias and Duets. These two really have a special chemistry together. All in all not a single dud in this collection.",1433721600,2,1614,5.235521235521236
