3657283,5,B001JAHSMS,I have liked all of the previous versions and will watch the entire series again and again.  Glad it finally came in the USA format.,1364256000,2,132,4.28
3657284,5,B001JAHSMS,"I would recommend anyone who is a huge fan to purchase this. It is my favorite, but my favorite actress is Mrs. Maryann Raigipcien Jean-Baptiste Williams, she is the absolute funniest ever.",1362614400,,189,4.9375
3657285,5,B001JAHSMS,It took a long time from season 2 to season 4 to come out but it was worth the wait.,1359417600,2,84,3.25
3657286,5,B001JAHSMS,Awesome. Anthony L is a great actor. He was best playing Simon Moon in Frasier. He brings a different style altogether playing an FBI agent. Without the english accent. All the other stars perform together great. A MUST SEE SERIES.,1357257600,,231,4.8
3657287,5,B001JAHSMS,I loved this show and watched every episode when they first aired.  I miss it and wish it had never gone off the air.,1355702400,,117,3.875
3657288,4,B001JAHSMS,"I love this series!
However, I've spent too much time waiting for these seasons to become available only to purchase it, get it home and have the first disc be non-readable! I tried it on my computer also and still nothing.
Happily the rest of the discs work. I hope when the next season is finally released, I don't have to deal with this.",1354060800,2,340,4.328125
3657289,4,B001JAHSMS,"I am very glad that Season 3 and 4 are available of this show. I always loved Without a Trace, but only seasons 1 and 2 were ever released until now. I always loved all the characters and how the cases unfolded. It is great when I see these actors on other shows since I kinda fell in love with them. I have not watched it yet, but I am so looking forward to seeing the cases solved again.",1352419200,,389,3.9367088607594938
3657290,5,B001JAHSMS,"In this episode Danny has the perfect setting to show his excellence and versatility as an actor. Set in Mexico, this episode brings into focus the importance of understanding other cultures, as Jack and Danny must work outside US jurisdiction with Mexican law enforcement in order to solve a case. As always the chemistry among the team is seamless and their newest member, a beautiful, street savvy and razor-sharp Hispanic recruit from NYPD, gets some camera time to show her bad-self.
This is a great episode. I give it 5 stars. (Le doy 5 estrellas!)

Jenn",1299110400,,560,4.833333333333333

3657330,3,B001JAHSMS,"Series and acting is outstanding, but I'd wait until price comes down. $30+ for seasons 3-7 is just plain ridiculous!! I am a Without A Trace ""junkie"" so I bit my tongue and paid the price; but if you can wait, then just grab it at the local library until the price comes down to a more reasonable $10-20 a season.",1443052800,,314,4.163934426229508

3657381,4,B001JAHSMS,I loved this series when it was on TV so I had to have the series to add to my DVD collection. The weekly stories of finding people who had gone missing were intriguing to watch. I love the friendship between the main characters and how they grew over the different seasons. Loved this show!,1389571200,,291,4.3090909090909095

3657426,3,B001JAHSMS,"I liked ""Without A Trace"" for the first three seasons.  The stories are good and interesting.  As the series progressed, as with many American shows, the writers or producers decide that it is not  scary, gory, or intense enough so the shows become blood pressure raisers rather than cerebral.  I like to come away feeling good and relaxed, not keyed up and stressed out.  This was the last series of this show that I purchase or watch.",1376092800,4,436,4.6103896103896105
3657427,4,B001JAHSMS,The fifth DVD (out of six) would not play. The return window was only 30 days so by the time I got around to watching the last DVD the return window had expired. So now I am stuck with an incomplete season because the one did not play. I would only buy DVDs from Amazon if you can watch them immediately.,1373500800,2,304,4.0
3657428,5,B001JAHSMS,"Without A Trace was one of the great TV detective shows, and it was willing to go into the darkest issues and follow the redoubtable FBI Missing Persons Unit to its sometimes tragic conclusions. Lapaglia often gave a touching, powerful performance.",1373500800,,248,5.073170731707317

8312673,5,B001JAHSMS,"One of my favorite criminal dramas. Darker, grittier, but you find yourself really caring if the person being found will be OK, since they don't always end up that way.",1524182400,,168,4.633333333333334
