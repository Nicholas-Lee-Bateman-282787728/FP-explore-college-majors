2931558,5,B000V6LSLI,"I own all 6 seasons and they still captivate me.  Fess Parker, who passed not to long ago, was the best Daniel Boone! I have seen other actors portray Daniel Boone and I found them unbelievable compared to Fess Parker.",1359417600,,218,4.45

2931560,1,B000V6LSLI,"Ain't paying this much!!  If all DB fans will write the producer of these DVD's to re-issue, maybe they will.  I for one, will.

P.S. For one of the merchants, the asking price is $3,710.99!!! I guess his merchant is not eager to do business and sell this item.",1351641600,7,261,4.285714285714286

2931563,5,B000V6LSLI,"Well, I finally got to buy the final season to this series. After viewing the previous five seasons I can now add my thoughts to this final season. As great as ever. I have really enjoyed watching this series.
A new character was introduced in this season portrayed by Roosevelt Grier and fitted right in. Plenty of action and fun. They just don't make shows like this anymore. High quality entertainment in every episode
I will be watching these DVD's for years to come.",1326153600,,471,4.619047619047619
2931564,5,B000V6LSLI,"I must say, this boxed set of Daniel Boone, Season 6, is indeed a very entertaining collection of 26 episodes. I've seen the first twelve so far, and I'll be seeing the rest of them whenever possible. I have a complaint about the menu screen for each of the indiviual episodes, why is it that the folks at Liberation left a picture of Mingo in there (where he was pictured with Daniel's wife, Rebecca), when they could have used pictures of Josh Clements and Gabe Cooper instead, after all, Ed Ames left the series after season four, otherwise it was a very good buy for myself.",1287014400,3,578,4.462264150943396

2931566,5,B000V6LSLI,"I love the dvd's, but they take forever to arrive.  Seems like it goes on close to a month before they finally arrive.  I tracked the order this time, and it sat in New York, right next door, for about 2 weeks.  Not the sellers fault I guesss, but so much for the 7 to 10 buissiness days!",1268870400,,288,3.9310344827586206

2931573,5,B000V6LSLI,Daniel Boone was a wholesome family television show with an excellent cast.  We could do well to have more shows like that today as nothing on prime time today is appropriate for young children to watch.,1236729600,3,203,4.638888888888889

8216885,3,B000V6LSLI,"I recently bought the newly released Complete Series set but wanted to compare to these older releases so I got S. 6, disc 1 from Netflix. Doing a side by side comparison I see that they are all out of broadcast order on the older set. I also see that the 1st episode is cut to about 42 minutes while it is around 50 minutes on the new complete series set. All the other episodes I checked seem to be within a few seconds of each other. Now I do see a more blurry green forest on the older set so I'm giving the new set the nod on video quality as well. Also you can only play one episode at a time on the older set. It does have a supposed 5.1 audio option plus 2.0 English and Spanish while the new set only has the original 2.0 but you can play all episodes with just one click! I did buy the old Season 2 and it has some brief extras and photos with Fess Parker, Ed Ames, Darby and about 30 seconds with Veronica Cartwright but it was only 21.00, not way overpriced like this Season 6 set is!",1413158400,,996,3.9601990049751246
