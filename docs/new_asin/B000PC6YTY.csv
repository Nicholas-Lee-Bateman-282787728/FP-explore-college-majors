2815877,5,B000PC6YTY,"Stop what you are doing and order Foyles War IV.  You will watch it over and over, just like Foyles War I through III.

Michael Kitchen (of ""Out of Africa"", who played the King in the last episode of ""House of Cards"" and captivated us in  ""Reckless"") continues to master his craft and contribute to the tradition of British TV..  The cast, as ever,  is delightful (who can't love Sam, played by the actress with the loveable name ""Honeysuckle Weeks""?  The through research and intense staging of the detailed sets puts you there in WWII England, with the all the hardships, complete with stiff upper lip, ""lets muddle through this together attitude"" but without the sugar and candy Hollywood would add to the mix.  Like ""Law and Order"" the casting of the most minor characters ring true, with blue bloods and bad bloods played by gents, ladies. toffs and cads that look the part, act the role and radiate believeabilty.

 This is a series that I hope will run on and on, and we are fortunate to have Part IV availabe so soon after it has run on PBS.",1183852800,4,1049,4.507936507936508
2815878,5,B000PC6YTY,"This is outstanding. This is not to be missed by anyone who appreciates excellent acting, superb writing, perfect period settings and clothes. Michael Kitchen is easily one of the best of the British actors working now - which means one of the best in the world. His subtle, nuanced work is completely believable - never misses a beat. The supporting cast is easily equal. Honeysuckle is adorable - one of the most unique women on the air - and we think she might be the most attractive on either side of the Atlantic. We also like the entire casting set up - people look like PEOPLE - not anorexic 22 year olds who we are supposed to believe are department heads and bosses. The guys in charge are middle aged - this, despite Hollywood's fond delusions - is really how it is.

The Foyle's War series has a more serious intent as well as mystery and entertainment - although it more than fulfills this goal. It also examines different aspects of the war as it was lived by the English. Not glamorized, or shined up, but the way it was. Again, the people look like people look, so you aren't trying to overcome disbelief from the getgo - so you are pulled right into the time and place and situations. Absolutely top notch. I wish I could give it 10 stars out of a possible 5!",1183420800,9,1275,4.4025423728813555
2815879,5,B000PC6YTY,"From Michael Kitchen to Honeysuckle Weeks to the plots to the scenes, this is as flawless a series of movies as I can remember. Classy, poignant at times, funny.

Conveys the WWII period in England in depth without detracting from the plot. Despite the quality of backstory and the depth of the primary characters, these episodes remain mysteries. Amidst the background of war in England in the forties, Foyle hunts what some might see as petty murders or ""just thieves"". It reminds me of Night of the Generals, showing the single-mindedness and bulldog grip a police officer can have even though the world around him seems to be crumbling.

An expensive, quality piece of storytelling and movie making.

I have the series-to-date and eagerly wait for more.",1181520000,51,757,4.94488188976378
2815880,5,B000PC6YTY,We loved this as a series now have bought all the Foyle`s War sets. We were so happy to see series 4 hope there are more Please!!!!,1181347200,9,131,3.888888888888889
2815881,5,B000PC6YTY,"Michael Kitchen triumphs again as detective chief ""superintendent Christopher Foyle. He often identifies himself, however, rather more charmingly: ""My name is Foyle. I'm a police officer."" No badge is shown or papers presented while so introducing himself. Such would be superfluous though as Kitchen's Foyle, in mannerisms, demeanor, as well as the way his carries himself, makes it rather apparent that he is in law enforcement. And to boot, all this takes place in the early days of the 4th decade of the 20th century, ""in the beautiful southern English countryside amid the disorder and danger of World War II""(to quote the packaging).

As in all Foyle episodes a murder takes place and Kitchen methodically goes about solving it. He has a sergeant for assistance as well as an actress side-kick (whose most unusual name in real life is Honeysuckle Weeks) who plays an army soldier seconded to drive for Foyle, who is without a license to do so. Like in many detective dramas the who did it is rather less important than the drama getting to that point. Actually, these hour and forty minute long Foyle episodes often go by for me without my giving much serious contemplation toward the solution Foyle seeks. Ever play chess and really focus on 3, 4, 5, 6 possible moves in advance and then play a casual game of chess just for fun? That's how I personally watch Foyle's War. I'm not too interested in guessing then second guessing again & again who I think is the murderer. (I do do that often with David Suchet's Hercule Poirot Agatha Christie mystery dramas, but alas, do too much guessing wrong there, however.

The episodes:
""Invasion""
March 1942: The US Army Corps of Engineers arrives in Hastings to build an aerodrome and Foyle needs to calm a local farmer whose land has been requisitioned by the government.  In this episode we also are treated to a guest appearance by Philip Jackson;  aka Chief Inspector Jap from Agatha Cristie's Poirot series,  although he's but a pub owner herein.  And we also get a major development in the Sam Stewart/Andrew Foyle relationship.

""Bad Blood""
A lone aircraft drops a bomb over farmland. Nearby sheep start dying, then a farmers wife, and Sam falls ill.

""Bleak Midwinter""
December 1942: DCS Foyle investigates the death of Grace Phillips who died in what appears to be an accident in a munitions factory.

""Casualties of War""
March 1943: Foyle receives a visit from his goddaughter, who he has not seen for 10 years, and her young son who is shell shocked from when his school was bombed.

Watching Foyle is also very much a period drama, as I've said, giving one a feel for wartime England, the country lanes, the occasional military vehicle and soldier(s), authentic clothes, hats, people on missions greater than themselves passing through the lens. My advice thus is not to overly focus on actively trying to solve these tough-to-crack mysteries to better revel in the actual performances herein. Notwithstanding the ""Columbo"" series being a totally different style of show, Foyle's War shares a number of similarities with Peter Falk's famed detective: the who-did-it is not the most interesting part of the show, but watching the very deliberate and understated detective go about his job. I particularly relish Columbo's speech manners and the way he draws things out as if they were salt water taffy as he hems and haws, pauses, retreats, etc. Michael Kitchen's Foyle, albeit in his own unique way, is entertaining just to watch as well. He is a man of few words, but very communicative with his demeanor, facial expressions, and the like. A hostile possible suspect verbally lambasts Foyle in one episode, for instance, while Foyle looks into this man's eyes watching him vent. When the man finishes, Foyle begins to pass the man on his way out. The man comes after Foyle trying to add a coda to his venting and when doing so attempts to grab hold of Foyle's arm. Foyle simply continues on his way and half over his shoulder, simply says to a uniformed officer behind him, ""arrest this man."" In another episode a person asks how Foyle knew something that would be hard to know and came to the conclusion that he did. To which Foyle responds, a picture in his hand, and a knowing expression on his expressive face: ""I found this in her diary. I found the diary under her pillow."" Maybe I'm just a glutton for language precisely employed, language--bereft of unneeded words---delivered with style. Cheers",1180310400,35,4465,4.855453350854139
2815882,5,B000PC6YTY,"Four very strong episodes here, even more compelling, I think, than Season 3, and coming to a surprising -- and yet absolutely fitting -- conclusion at the end of the fourth episode.  Michael Kitchen is as good as he always is as Foyle, and both Milner (Anthony Howell) and Samantha (Honeysuckle Weeks)are given interesting complications in their lives.  The stories include the arrival of American allies, hush-hush experiments with chemical agents for warfare, and the dangers to women workers in a more conventional munitions factory, the latter being a particularly nicely-constructed plot that ties personal issues to larger issues of both moral and political import.  Then Foyle's god-daughter appears out of the blue to complicate a life already complicated by the demands of a new Assistant Commissioner, a nasty piece of work well-played by Michael Jayston.  Once again, Anthony Horowitz, the creator and writer of the series, shows himself attentive to the sometimes less-obvious ways in which the war affected ordinary people's lives, and blends that ""background"" effectively into the circumstances of a criminal investigation.  Great stuff!",1476748800,,1152,5.4858757062146895

When I sit down to watch Foyle's War, especially in the first six sets, I just settle in with a smile on my face, knowing that I will not ever be disappointed.  Michael Kitchen is amazing and conveys so much with just a grimace, a nod of his head, a tsk, the bearest sign of a smile.  He's quiet, observant and brilliant.  And one comes to know is heart so well with the way in which he does NOT convey his feelings.  Yet you can see them and feel them.  One's heart reaches out to him without pity, but with admiration and trust.  He NEVER disappoints!",1400198400,,680,4.06015037593985
2815911,4,B000PC6YTY,"Love the series although I have a hard time believing anyone could be as calm and collected as DCS Foyle appears to be.  Certainly not anyone I know but that adds just an extra bit of interest to me.  The stories are not only interesting they also paint a rich picture of life during the War.  I have gotten quite an education or at least an increase awareness of the hardships people endured on a daily basis.  I only took away one star because while the information states it has closed captions, it does not.  A shame really because it is hard for people who cannot hear well to get the full content of what is being said.

2815916,5,B000PC6YTY,"It appears considerable care was taken in filming this series in attempting to portray a long-gone era and value set. They succeeded wonderfully. While I have not had the pleasure of experiencing England, London, or Hastings in particular, I grew up during WW II.  It is easy to recall ""the feel"" of general cooperation among people, and willingness to sacrifice for the common good. The Air Raid Wardens, blackouts, rationing and food and materiel restraints remain vivid memories. There wasn't any ""media"" except the radio and newspapers. Yes, and it was exciting to hear Roosevelt or Churchill speak, or read their exhortations. Even radar was in it's infancy and unproven, but the seeds of bacteriological warfare were sown in WW I, and further testing ensued in WW II. References to common practices like hiring women to replace men in factories, as truck drivers, and taking an active role in the military are faithful to the time - and give us an idea of how we've come to embrace ideas and practices today.",1388620800,,1014,4.895348837209302

2815934,5,B000PC6YTY,"I recommend that those who love historic based novels purchase not just this set - but the entire set (sets 1 through 5). You may piece-meal it in as we have done or purchase the whole set here on Amazon. The entire story takes you from the dark days in 39 through VE day in Britain. Each set contains four stories revolving around a mystery with WWII on the British home front as often the cause as not the cause of the mystery. Foyle is a man of principal, who does not think any injustice is insignificant. Sometimes he wins, sometimes he must accept to outcome, and sometimes it is a delayed victory.

Michael Kitchen has the starring role as Christopher Foyle, a detective chief superintendent in the English town of Hastings.  Michael Kitchen always portrays Christopher Foyle with a reserved wit. The story's setting is true to the era. In spite of Foyle's strong desire to join the war as a combatant, he is chosen to squelch conflict, prejudice, malice, and greed the war brings to this small English community.

Regulars include Anthony Howell, Honeysuckle Weeks, and Julian Ovenden as Foyle's son Andrew (who joins the war as a British fighter pilot) - they exceed in doing an excellent job of support - and help to make the story cohesive.",1259712000,,1251,4.65158371040724

2815936,5,B000PC6YTY,"In the whole oeuvre of Foyle's War, I believe that Series 4 was the best of them all.
 The accurate depiction of the coming of the Americans to English soil is historically correct.  You must remember England had been in this fray for more than 3 years, when all of a sudden here appears these Yanks in all their cockiness.
 In the first episode ""Invasion"" American GI's build an airbase near Hastings.  A murder occurs and this causes tense relations with these upshot Yanks.  Foyle calmly goes about his business to solve the crime.
 In ""Bad Blood""  we find out about the efforts of biological warfare.  Foyle has to contend with a life threatening sickness to his driver Sam.  Foyle seems to manage and life goes on.
 In ""Bleak Midwinter"" the death of a munitions worker and the murder of Paul Milner's wife are linked and Foyle moves in to seek the truth.
 In the last episode of Season 4 we see the human compassionate side of Christopher Foyle.  He strives to help his Goddaughter to help her severely traumatized son.
 As always the props and adherence to period realism are great.  Only one mistake!  Fort Benning is in Georgia and not Virginia as stated in ""Invasion"".
 Good take!  Five Stars!  Riightt!",1221955200,,1212,4.636792452830188
2815937,5,B000PC6YTY,"Series 4 of Foyle's War maintained the same high standard of its predecessors.  For me, one of the great joys of the series is the pace ... no frantic rush, no spectacular car chases, no shoot-em-ups.  Mostly, it's just people talking quietly to each other, beautifully observed and acted.  Christopher Foyle hardly ever even raises his voice.

I would just like to rise to the defence of two of the lead American characters in 'Invasion' (which, incidentally, was a very even-handed  portrayal of the tensions caused by the arrival of the US troops in Britain). Contrary to what some commenters seem to believe, both Jay Benedict (Captain Kieffer) and Corey Johnson (Sergeant O'Connor) are, in fact, from the US - the former from St. Barbara, California the latter New Orleans.

2815950,5,B000PC6YTY,"There are television series and then there's ""Foyle's War."" If one had to choose a production that depicts what the Brits are best at, it's this show.

So what are they best at? In my opinion, it's a natural leaning towards understatement combined with a steady growth in suspense. Several plot lines are developed until the conclusion which always leaves you thinking about ethics and politics. Alfred Hitchcock was a master of it and so is Anthony Horowitz, Foyle's creator.

The action takes place during World War 11, mostly around the town of Hastings. Foyle is Detective Chief Superintendent Christopher Foyle who wants to contribute to the war effort. His duty is to solve crimes on the domestic front and he always introduces himself as ""a police officer.""

Sometimes the crimes are political and other times they appear petty but actually, they are always very crucial because society has to function ethically during the war or there's no point in fighting for values that are not respected. A chaotic and lawless society would mean that the enemy has won.

That is Christopher Foyle's credo. Profiteers, traitors and looters will not be tolerated. It's almost like the zero tolerance policy that the city of New York adopted a few years ago when crime statistics were out of control.

In Foyle's War one is always conscious of the common good. There is a recurring theme of the need for all Brits to be treated as equals and Foyle uses this approach when it comes to crimes committed by the aristocracy. He is not impressed by status.

That does not mean that important people don't get away with misdemeanours and even murder, but as Foyle says he will come after them when the war is over. And we believe him, so strong is his moral code.

I absolutely love the way Horowitz shows two sides of a story. Nothing is simple or inevitable and the viewer is not insulted by too much explanation.

Basically, ""Foyle's War"" is a thinking person's detective story in which historical events play a crucial part. For example, in one episode there is a reference to Dunkirk with a description of what really went on there and how ordinary people went over to Dunkirk in the flimsiest of vessels to rescue their soldiers. It will make you cry because of the powerful emotions that are repressed by the fishermen. It's a million times more effective than that tedious Dunkirk episode in the film ""Atonement.""

As for the cast, there is Michael Kitchen in the role of Foyle. His portrayal is amazing. One slight twitch of his lips is all that's required to convey the deepest of emotions. A shrug, a raising of the eyebrows, even a moment of silence, says it all.

And it's his acting style that leaves an imprint on the other actors. His driver, Samantha Stewart, who is a little more emotional than her boss, is still the epitome of British stoicism and dedication with a touch of charming femininity. She is perfect in the role. Honeysuckle Weeks is spunky yet vulnerable in the portrayal of Samantha.

Paul Milner (played by Anthony Howell) is also perfect casting. He is Foyle's assistant who has been wounded in action in Norway and so has to return to home duties. His private life is a disaster because of his injury and this makes for interesting personal situations.

This is the trio of principal characters who will lead the audience from August 1940 to the end of the war in 1945. The final series is yet to be shown and I am certainly looking forward to it. As a matter of fact, I couldn't wait for it to be shown on Australian TV so I have pre-ordered it and hope it arrives soon.",1200355200,2,3595,4.661927330173776

2815953,5,B000PC6YTY,"I wasn't sure if I'd like this series, but I have all four seasons now and enjoy them very much.  They're absolutely stellar.

The ambiance is an important one: the city of Hastings on the SE coast of England.  This is the site of the invasion of the Normans in 1066.  It is that part of Great Britian settled, first by invitation, by the Angles and Saxons and where they took over by force of arms when they were much less welcome.  Here is where the Romano-Britians merged with the Anglo-Saxons and then the Norman French (and therefore Vikings) to create the Britian that has emerged at the present time.  For those interested in the history of the island, WWII can be seen as part of the on-going parre and thrust between the European mainland and the British Isles, which makes the war activity and the individual responses to it so vivid.

Also for the historian is the very accurate presentation of British culture, attitudes, and relationships during the 1930s and 1940s.  The creators of the series have paid close attention to detail, giving the audience a true experience of what it was like during the time. Clothing, housing, vehicals, the loss of privacy, the loss of common commodoties, the rise of a black market, etc.  More importantly it shows the very real effect of secrecy and fear of invasion on justice, truth, education, and relationships.  Probably no other series captures the individual human costs of that war--or any war.

The murder mysteries themselves are almost a bonus.  Done in a more classic style, or perhaps more properly a transitional style that links the manor house mysteries to the police procedural, the series is at once as fun as the old movies like The Thin Man and the Charlie Chan mysteries, and yet as complex and dramatic as the more modern series like Law and Order or Midsommer Murders.  In short the series has a little for each of us, and a lot for all of us.

The inspector, Foyle, is a taciturn individual.  Like a good poker player he gives nothing away until he lays down his cards to take the ""pot.""  His associates are delightful characters:  An attractive young detective injured in the war and returned to the police force, a pretty driver who has a all the drive and determination one would expect from this generation when they were young.

The mysteries themselves allow the viewer to see the difficulty of finding the purpetrator of a murder--or any serious crime--during a period of secrecy, suspicion, almost paranoia.  It also shows some of the frustrations attendant upon bringing individuals to justice who are considered ""invaluable to the war effort.""  It presents the viewer with an important but unspoken question: when is our willingness to suspend the law, to make exceptions, to tolerate crime, to condone the supression of the rights of the individual make us as bad as the enemy and oppression we are fighting against.

A wonderful series.  Good mysteries, good characters, good ambiance, good history.  Stellar.",1197504000,5,2993,4.825490196078431

2815960,1,B000PC6YTY,"All I can say after watching the fourth season of Foyle's War is what happened???  Foyle's War was always a bit too reliant on the suspect immediately confessing all upon being accused, and the constant use of ""X is so important to the war effort that you can't arrest him or her"" plot device but otherwise the combination of a usually well knit detective story against the backdrop of England at war was enough to smooth over any rough edges.  Watching the parade of shirkers, war profiteers, hoarders, and other wartime miscreants juxtaposed against the suffering and bravery epitomized by the Blitz was probably the best part of Foyle's War, that and Michael Kitchen, whose understated DCS Foyle was the heart and moral center of the show.

Weaving together multiple plot threads seemed to have gotten more and more difficult as the series progressed and came almost completely unraveled in Season Four, particularly in the final episode ""Casualties of War""  When previously the interaction of the main characters had taken place slowly and in a natural evolution, we saw Andrew, son of DCS Foyle,  played by Julian Overden, a key character in earlier seasons who had begun a romantic relationship with Samantha Stewart, ably played by Honeysuckle Weeks, tossed aside with a 20 second voice over in ""Invasion""
Sergeant Paul Milner, played by Anthony Howell, loses his wife and picks up a love interest in ""Bleak Midwinter"" which seems to disappear in later episodes.

""Casualties of War"" really seems to take the cake, however.  A hitherto unmentioned god-daughter of Foyle's pops up with an autistic son, tries to kill herself, fails, a bomb goes off, doesn't hurt Sam, but cures the son, all of which has absolutely nothing to do with the murder in the case.  A couple of young locals pop up, deus machina style, to save Milner at a dice game, to visit the very lame murder in the episode and most improbably to get blackmail by a fat Spanish diplomat into acts of sabotage.  Again very incoherent plotting!

The murder itself is completely implausible taking place at another one of those ""vital to the war effort"" secret labs that seemed to dot Hastings, clearly the nerve center of the whole war effort, Hastings!  I spotted the dam-busters plot device immediately (though played as some great achievement destroying the Rhine dams did little to end the war, but caused civilian deaths and destruction).  The murderess kills her husband and explains that he was attacking the equipment and had to kill him to protect it.  Too bad protection of property is not a sufficient excuse to kill under English law, but everyone seems to find it plausible.

Probably the weirdest part of the episode was Foyle acting completely out of character and getting into a snit with the Assistant Commissioner, despite putting up with far worse for four seasons, Foyle flips out over the Spanish diplomat and resigns!

What had starting as a gripping detective drama in a fascinating war time environment by the end of Season Four had almost completely fallen to pieces.  What a shame!",1193443200,13,3075,4.9073359073359075

Not quite. I found the earlier episodes more interesting and plausible and the dnouement more satisfying, particularly the expose of corrupt higher ranked officials. My great expectations were probably unrealistic, and I do indeed recommend this set for the lovers of Foyle's war. I think the 4 episodes of set two were the best.",1186531200,2,609,4.855769230769231
2815999,5,B000PC6YTY,These are the best detective stories around these days. The plots in each story are many and interesting. Michael Kitchen is an excellant actor. He fits the part perfectly as well as the other actors in each DVD. I wish he (they) would make more of this series of stories. They are teriffic. Better that most other mysteries out there. I know I have bought and seen most of them.,1186531200,,379,4.428571428571429
2816000,5,B000PC6YTY,"The fourth series of ""Foyle's War,"" an award-winning British made-for-television historical mystery series, has just made its Public Broadcasting System television debut in this country.  It has also been released, in a four DVD set of its four new, feature-length episodes, to coincide with that debut.  The popular show, created and written by the remarkably young, talented and prolific Anthony Horowitz, stars Michael Kitchen (""Reckless,"" ""Out of Africa,"") as Detective Chief Inspector Foyle.  He's ably backed by series regulars Honeysuckle Weeks as Samantha Stewart, his assigned Motor Pool driver; and Anthony Howell, as Sgt. Milner, his second in command.  Guest stars in this set include Kenneth Colley, Michael Jayston, and Roy Marsden.

The series is set during World War II: the middle-aged Foyle, who'd prefer to be part of the war effort, must instead fight his lonely battle on the home front, in and around Hastings, on England's south coast; where he has supposedly been sent, from London, to keep the peace.  This would be the area most vulnerable to a possible German invasion; conversely, it's also the area where American troops are being massed prior to Dday, when the Allies will invade the continent of Europe.  The shows are beautifully filmed on location in London, and on the south coast; each, in addition to a mystery, deals with some of the lesser-known effects of the war: gambling, bootlegging, biological warfare, women in the work force.  Horowitz's work has deservedly received top-drawer treatment: there are many speaking parts, all strongly cast, plenty of cars and extras, accurate set dressing.

The first episode in this series, ""Invasion,"" does, in fact, deal with the only invasion this area, and Britain as a whole, actually suffered in this war, that of the American troops being shipped over and stationed in preparation for Dday.  At one point, Lord Haw Haw, as the English called one of their better-known turncoats, is heard broadcasting English-language anti-American propaganda on German radio.  He's just giving us a variation of what the ordinary Englishman was saying: ""they're overfed, oversexed, overpaid, and over here.""  The satisfyingly complex mystery centers on a provocative bar maid who does a sideline in bootlegging whiskey, and quickly gets too chummy with the Americans.

""Bad Blood,"" the series' second episode, is also a strong one, dealing as it does with the British Government's secret experiments in biological warfare, particularly anthrax, recently become too familiar to us.  The plot's many-layered; as is often the case in Horowitz's work, it gains emotional strength from overlapping family relationships: father/daughter, father/son, uncle/nephew.

""Bleak Midwinter,"" the third episode, is, to me, the weakest.  I'm greatly interested in the subject of women's joining the workforce, in jobs previously considered for men only, in such large numbers.  But the mystery's villain sure telegraphs his villainy from the show's opening seconds, and I doubt some of the forensics cited were then available.  Furthermore,lighter moments concerned a turkey carcass seized in evidence in a case of rations-cheating, and the fascination the bird exerted on cops starved for meat after years of that rationing.  But that fowl sure seemed to hang around long past the point where I'd welcome it on my plate.

""Casualties of War,"" the fourth episode, was interesting too.  Journalists say truth is the first casualty of war: in this episode, the playwright cites that saying, but then goes on to give us several more casualties.  People gamble past the point of no return.  Education is also in trouble;on top of the bombings, the forced transport of London schoolchildren to the country, and the general dislocation, 20,000 teachers are in the military, and many schools are closed.  In addition, we also see the well-known program in which scientists -- boffins, as the English call them -- are trying to develop a bomb that will destroy German dams.  ""The Dambusters--"" these specific scientists and their product, were the subject of several World War II-era movies.  We also see the German efforts to spy upon, and sabotage, this scientific undertaking.  All in all, it's quite a satisfactory show.

Well, the American troops are already over there, being held in readiness for Dday, June 6, 1944.  There's not much European war left, and there doesn't seem to be much appetite for ""Foyle's Peace.""  We'll just have to see.  So meanwhile, you ought to get your hands on this.",1186531200,4,4547,5.247579529737206
2816001,5,B000PC6YTY,"even tho I have seen this entire set on four sundays on one of the PBS stations , I  was thrilled when I saw it on Amazon to be pre-ordered and got it for $ 44.00 no S/H .
I must have lucked out .

won't go into detail how good I think this series is as so many have done a great job in their reviews .  But, everyone who buys these sets , be sure to view the ' extras '  such as "" the truth behind ""  each story . That makes it even better for me . I have all four sets now and will look for  #5 for pre- order the minute Amazon offers it . I'll be one of the first to do so .

they spend almost ( sometimes more ) then America does on any of it's t.v. movies and boy it is better then some of the theater releases people are willing to spend an arm and a leg for,  especially if they have family . Kudos Britain ...and michael kitchen : )",1186272000,,840,3.576923076923077
2816002,5,B000PC6YTY,"The great appeal of Foyle's War is its realism; it often interweaves actual historical events into the plots, which enhances the setting and further illuminates the plight of the characters.  This fact sets Foyle's War apart from the myriad of equally enjoyable, but often more colorful, or even a bit comical, mystery series.  Unlike the fabulous, and often fanciful, cases of beloved detectives like Hercule Poirot or Miss Jane Marple these stories portray the characters and victims with heart-wrenching reality.  Set Four in the series is no different; again we see the ways in which war affects the people at home; the families torn apart, the citizens simply trying to survive no matter the cost, the people who may not go into combat but are no less affected by the violence and chaos of battle.
Featuring impeccable ensemble casts for each episode including subtle, nuanced performances from Michael Kitchen as DCS Foyle, these mysteries transcend mere whodunnits.  The characters are developed enough that the viewer can actually feel for them; the crimes are complex enough to engage one's mind until the end.  The final episode in this series, ""Casualties of War"", involving the traumatizing after-effects of the London Blitz on Foyle's nephew is a star in the set.  These stories pose real questions about the morality of war; What conduct is acceptable during war? What rules can be bent in the name of victory?  It is Foyle's constant struggle with these problems that makes this series so engaging.  Series five cannot come too soon!",1184803200,5,1548,5.066929133858268
2816003,4,B000PC6YTY,"""Foyle's War"" Series 4 takes us once again to see World War II from the homefront, the homefront being the town of Hastings on England's southern coast. Perspicacious and taciturn Detective Chief Superintendent Christopher Foyle (Michael Kitchen) does his best to maintain justice for both civilians and military in a time of war and powerful politics. He is aided by Detective Sergeant Paul Milner (Anthony Howell), whose soldiering was cut short by injury, and by his adventurous young MTC driver Samantha ""Sam"" Stewart (Honeysuckle Weeks). Again, PBS chose to air shortened 85-minute versions of these episodes. Unfortunate, since the substance of daily life in a nation at war is in the details. You'll find the full 100-minute versions on the DVDs. The ""Series 4""  DVDs technically comprise Series 4 and 5, for a total of 4 episodes.

These four episodes take place March 1942-March 1943. The mysteries revolve around events or circumstances that were reality for many British at home while their men fought abroad: GIs arrive in England as the US enters the War in Europe, experiments with biological warfare, resentment and lower pay for women doing dangerous jobs at a munitions factory, touchy international politics hamper efforts to contain saboteurs. I rate Series 4 slightly lower than previous series, because these episodes felt more contrived. The stories seem far-fetched, and DCS Foyle exhibits less depth than he used to. There are an awful lot of top secret facilities in Hastings and its environs and too many coincidences. A little carelessness too: Streptomycin was not discovered until 1943, but they're using it in Hastings in 1942. Nevertheless, ""Foyle's War"" is undeniably entertaining.

In ""Invasion"", American military aka ""Doughboys"" arrive to construct an airfield on Hawthorn Cross, a property belonging David Barrett (Keith Barron). The American Captain Kieffer (Jay Benedict) asks DCS Foyle to help quell the hostility between his men and cantankerous Mr. Barrett, whose farm they are paving over, and to give the GIs some guidance on British culture. Sgt. Milner investigates a house fire in which a drunk man died, leading him to wonder where the man could have gotten so much liquor. A pub proprietor and his ambitious barmaid Susan Davies (Zoe Tapper) are running an illegal distillery. Just as the trail leads to her, Susan is found dead, strangled at dance hosted by the Americans, where she had come to see her boyfriend, Private Jimmy Taylor (Peter Youngblood Hills).

""Bad Blood"" finds Sam dating a smitten American ""GI Joe"" and a nearby military installation conducting experiments in biological warfare. An infected sheep falls off a lorry near Foxhall Farm. Edith Ashford (Caroline Martin), former flame of Sgt. Milner's, implores him to help her brother Martin (Tim Delap), a conscientious objector who has been accused of murdering naval hero Tom Jenkins (Anthony Flanagan). Martin refuses to defend himself, but even Tom's friends swear that Martin is innocent. Meanwhile, the widow of the dead man, Elsie (Claire Cox), falls seriously ill with a respiratory ailment and black sores on her skin. Shortly afterward, Sam develops the same symptoms. All trails lead to Foxhall farm, where Elsie and Martin worked, and where Sam recently cut herself.

Grace Phillips (Kate Ambler) is killed on the job at a munitions factory when she accidentally drops a fuse for a high explosive shell in ""Bleak Midwinter"". It appears to be a tragic accident, and Foyle is occupied investigating a restaurateur selling contraband turkeys, until Grace's co-worker voices her suspicions that Grace was troubled by something serious and had come to work very ill. Grace's unstable boyfriend Harry (Gavin Brocker) is up to some mischievous enterprise. Sgt. Milner's estranged wife Jane (Mali Harries) is back in town after 2  years and wants to rekindle her relationship with a reluctant Milner, who has found love elsewhere. When Jane is found bludgeoned to death, Paul Milner becomes the prime suspect.

""Casualties of War"" refers not to injured persons but to the ideals of justice that are sacrificed to the cause during wartime. Two wayward young men, Frank and Terry Morgan (Gerard Kearns & Harry Eden) are discovered breaking into a palatial home and blackmailed into being saboteurs. Foyle's goddaughter Lydia Nicholson (Kate Fleetwood) shows up on his doorstep, supposedly to give her young son James a change of scenery, as he has not spoken since his school was bombed. The new Assistant Commission Parkins (Michael Jayston) insists that Foyle crack down on an organized gambling ring, but Foyle is busy with the sabotage. When Michael Richards (Kevin Doyle), a man with heavy gambling debts, is murdered, the trail leads to the research facility where his wife Evelyn (Abigail Cruttenden) works on the secret development of spinning bombs intended for German dams.",1184457600,13,4902,5.221092757306226
2816004,5,B000PC6YTY,"Upon watching the last thrilling episode, in which Foyle confronts the insurmountable stumbling blocks of wartime necessity headlong by tendering his resignation----After all, the Ruhr dams must be busted!----I had to go online to make sure that a new season was coming up. I have become addicted to this low-key but absorbing, instructive, and endlessly entertaining mystery series. And there are still about three years of World War II to go.

As this series continues, the leading characters, Chief Inspector Foyle (Michael Kitchen) and Samantha (Honeysuckle Weeks), become ever more engaging. The settings of Hastings and the Sussex countryside become ever more picturesque. Moreover, as the mysteries become ever more intriguing, the narrative of Britain during the Blitz----the people's hardships, their gallantry, and in many cases their victimization by unscrupulous profiteers----becomes indelibly compelling. The series would make an excellent teaching tool in a history class, since it not only presents a fascinating account of the war but it also gives a realistic depiction of the toll that war takes on the civilian population. This splendid BBC series puts a human face both on casualties and survivors, whom the modern media tend to dismiss with the callous and meaningless catchphrase, ""collateral damage.""

Whew! I can now rest easy. There will indeed be another season of ""Foyle's War"" in 2008.",1183852800,65,1414,5.481651376146789
