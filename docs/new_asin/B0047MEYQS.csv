8418249,4,B0047MEYQS,"I must say this DVD was put together well.  All three discs give you a different look at World War 1.  Disc one takes you through the battles during World War 1.  Disc two takes you behind the scenes and presents footage that looks like soldiers filmed it.  Disc three was music from the war days. I enjoyed disc three because an individual can watch hours and hours of war footage, but you never hear anything about music back then",1292976000,,432,4.3625
