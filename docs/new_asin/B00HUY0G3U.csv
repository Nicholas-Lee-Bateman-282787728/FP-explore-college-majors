a hint of 'kaen' and 'abel' has a subtle demure during the entirety... but also infallible truth of moral unity, theistic & non-theistic EQUALLY!!!

...ALL but the last 30 seconds kept the mutual harmony of the intent of this production!!!
...this can be simply summed up with the statement at 18:42 which reflects a universal standard of fortitude... not a 'religious' act of selfishness!

...at the end of this, and the end of my day, I thoroughly enjoyed this production!!!!
...Aron Ra is intelligently superb as equally as Matt D and David S is!!!

8636138,1,B00HUY0G3U,"I know the topic is important but OH this is so dull. Nothing gets you drowsier than watching fat white guys arguing. Sure, they may say they're ""having a conversation"" or ""exchanging dialogue"" but let's get real -- they're arguing. And the film takes 10 or 15 minutes of atheists telling the camera how nice a person John Christy is. Hmmm. Many points in the arguments are repeated in the film. It really only needed to be about 20 minutes long. And who the heck is John Christy talking to when he's sitting in front of the bookshelf? He's the director. Is talking to himself?",1502150400,,577,4.504761904761905
8636139,5,B00HUY0G3U,"I am a Christian but have listened to David's podcasts for a while now trying to understand the atheist's perspective. A lot of good dialogue here between the two and sharing of ideas.  Really helped me understand the atheistic view and the major points where they differ from Christians.

Both guys were very cordial which made the focus on ideas rather than bashing each other!  Great job!",1494460800,3,391,4.8059701492537314
8636140,1,B00HUY0G3U,"John didn't spend a week as an atheist. He strictly spent it in atheism as the title states. He spoke publicly as a Christian throughout the film. John debated with David about mercy. He said that as atheists we don't understand it because we don't realize that we deserve hell, death and judgement. Only when we understand such things, we'll be able to appreciate god's mercy. I personally stewed in that self loathing for about four decades before I left Christianity. It caused me to be suicidal from ages 10 to 25. That guilty mindset also groomed me to attract many abusive spiritual leaders and passive aggressive mean girls at CFNI and in church. Christianity is not dependant upon the resurrection of Jesus Christ, it instead thrives upon the guilt of it. Without condemning people (that we're the ones responsible for the torture and death of Jesus), Christianity would cease to exist.",1491782400,5,894,4.8881578947368425
8636141,5,B00HUY0G3U,"A co-creation between a Christian and an atheist, MWIA had the potential to be an unbiased and calm look into both paradigms. I am elated to say, unreservedly, that this was achieved.

Hard questions are asked on both sides of the pasture. The Problem of Evil, evolution/creationism, sin, biblical genocide, eternal torture, politics and religion, empiricism and tough bible verses are just a few of the hard topics addressed in this film (I only wish they could have included more, but fortunately, the extra features and deleted scenes are copious). Traveling cross-country, the interviewers amass a wide variety of opinions and are always respectful. I recommend this film for anyone who wants to learn about both worldviews (or even how to make a fair documentary).

Some portions that really stood out for me include the profound end-stage Stockholm Syndrome exhibited by John Christie. His indignation, though kept well under control, was palpable. I could tell that he was feeling profoundly uncomfortable and indignant just below the surface. He was unable to objectively apply consistent standards to the god he worships and human beings. His deity of choice is given a pedestal from which he could never fall. Morality by fiat is John's paradigm du jour. His attempts to weasel out of the Problem of Evil are equally flimsy. According to John, free will necessarily entails the possibility for suffering. So either there will be suffering in heaven, or there will be no free will in heaven. Either way, there's no reason (at least that I can see) that god cannot simply create an incorruptible heaven and be done with creation at that point. Creating Adam and Eve, two beings who god already knows will sin and fall, is pointless and viciously cruel.

John Christie disgusted me at 1:35:30. Can't he put 2 and 2 together? If god is omnipotent, then it WAS his will that Michelle was raped.

Whose free will was more crucial? Obviously Castro's.

And this has been pointed out countless times in debates, but simply because our meaning in our lives won't last for eternity doesn't mean
there's no meaning in the here and now. Christie was like a broken record. Pastors could easily be replaced with tape recordings and their
productions would be vastly improved. There would be no degradation over time as their vocal cords aged and ultimately failed.",1455753600,3,2360,4.979695431472082

Props to John for being open minded enough to make this.",1414454400,,160,4.366666666666666

8636144,5,B00HUY0G3U,"I am an atheist but I appreciated the courage John must have in order to make this.  Very insightful and refreshing to see a theist realize that atheists are not bad people!  Wonderfully done,",1393718400,5,192,4.617647058823529
8636145,5,B00HUY0G3U,"Filmed by an evangelical filmmaker it is actually a great advertisement for reason, logic & their results, atheism.  The filmmaker is obviously a wonderful human being who has bought into some myths but is very open to learning & emotionally appealing.  My favorite part of the movie are the interviews with David Silverman, Matt Dilahunty & Aaron Ra.  The movie is very good until the very last minute where the filmmaker does a bit of preaching but he was so more then fair up to that point I'll give it to him.  It is actually just a little sad that he thinks (after talking to all these atheists) we would be moved by a brief emotional appeal.  David is very reasonable, rational, even-keeled & real.  I highly recommend every theist watch this movie & all atheists should own it to lend out.",1393545600,6,796,4.570422535211268
8636146,5,B00HUY0G3U,As a fundamentalist Christian who became an atheist later in life I thoroughly enjoyed this raw and honest look at atheism through a Christian viewpoint.  This documentary followed John Christie who is a Christian as he went to atheist conventions and spoke his views on an atheist podcast (Dogma Debate) with David Smalley.  I enjoyed that David and John were civil to one another and had deep meaningful conversations and ACTUALLY listened to each other.  Often Christians think of atheists as people who have never read the Bible or heard the gospel of Christ and that just isn't true and this movie revealed how very much (some) atheists know about religion and Christianity. I think that John gave atheists  a  fair opportunity to express their views and be seen as human beings with morals and ethics.  This movie is great for Christians and atheists alike.  More than anything I think this movie shows that we can be tolerant and loving to each other with or without a religion or faith in a god.,1393027200,11,1003,4.763005780346821
