1431278,2,B00005JD5M,"Finding the body of Christ is the key theme of this film. If the body were found, would it destroy Christianity? I will let you see this drek to determine the final answer.
The film asks an interesting question. Unfortunately, it gets bogged down in setting up the question, that the author's answer is revealed long before the final reel. It is almost anti-climatic to watch the ending. Hollywood formula gone mad.
The dialog is stilted and stupid. There are scientific, as well as storyline, inconsistencies, and it is, overall, a boring movie.
There is one highlight. The cinematography is excellent. Some of the aerial shots will take your breath away, esp. if you enjoy glimpses of Jerusalem.",997401600,4,697,4.915254237288136
1431279,1,B00005JD5M,"This film had a nice message, ""Blessed are those who believe yet do not see."".  It's too bad that they had to ruin this with yet another Hollywood assault on the Catholic hierarchy and the type of political naivety those Hollywood clowns are so well known for.  Using the name of liberation theologist (an attempt to smuggle Marxism into Christianity) Gutierez as the main protagonist is another nice touch.  The idea that we can have a God who is involved in some parts of our lives but not in others is a nice job of liberal swindling and a good way to avoid responsibility for our actions.  To Hollywood:  Come on get off it guys.  Could you please give us something worthwhile for once?  By the way, if the Catholic church were to sell out to political squabbling, they wouldn't take such a hard line on such ethical questions as abortion and human sexuality; instead, they'd just do what all our ""courageous"" American leaders do and ""take a poll"".  Nice Hollywood.  Keep up the good work.",996019200,4,993,4.596590909090909

1431281,4,B00005JD5M,"I rented this movie today and after I watched it, I thought it could have been made better even though the movie itself was great. The movie credits Jonas McCord for writing and directing this movie, but ""Body"" has the same premise as a book I read in 1994 titled ""A Skeleton in God's Closet"" by Paul L. Maier. When I first read it, I could not put it down. I still own that book and I know it's much better than the movie ""Body"". To understand my point, you have to read ""A Skeleton in God's Closet"" for yourself",994896000,,513,4.14
1431282,2,B00005JD5M,"**1/2  What could be sadder for lovers of great movies than a case of missed opportunity?  So many films are so piddling in their ambition, scope and purpose that, as jaded moviegoers, we crave that rare film that will tackle monumental themes, fearless of consequences and immune to compromise.
""The Body"" had the potential to be one of the most provocative and controversial films of recent times - a film so challenging in its theme that it would make ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" look like a Sunday School lesson.  Let's face it:  you don't win popularity contests by challenging the very foundation of one of the world's core religions (as the brouhaha over ""Temptation"" a dozen or so years ago testified).  Alas, for all its potential for greatness, ""The Body,"" after displaying the temerity to pick up the ball and run with it, fumbles badly long before it makes it out of home territory.
The premise of the film is daring, ingenious and courageous:  an archaeologist, a young Jewish woman named Sharon Golban, has uncovered what could well turn out to be the find to end all finds - the body of a crucified man laid in a rich man's tomb, in other words, the possibly unresurrected body of Jesus Christ.  The implications of this discovery - for history, for religion, for the world as a whole - would, of course, be overwhelming and mind-boggling.  However, a theme of such shattering monumental proportions cries out for a filmmaker of commensurate stature to cope with the many moral complexities that such a premise lends itself to.  Unfortunately, writer/director Jonas McCord is not that filmmaker.  I haven't read the novel (written by Richard Ben Sapir) upon which the film is based, but I can attest to the fact that, after an intriguing beginning, ""The Body"" falls far short of its very real promise.  In many ways, the film is a maddening tease, promising to be a morally and intellectually challenging experience, yet in the end leaving us feeling empty, compromised and cheated.
So where exactly does the film go wrong?  For one thing the scope of the film is simply too small.  A story of this size needs to be dealt with on a more global scale.  The implications of such a discovery would most likely turn the world as we know it upside down and, thus, we yearn for a treatment that would be commensurate with that possibility.  Somehow, the characters that have been chosen to act out the drama fail to fire up our imaginations.  Sharon, the archaeologist, is aided in her research by a hunky Central American Jesuit priest named Father Gutierrez (Antonio Banderas) whom the Vatican has chosen (for truly obscure reasons) to essentially debunk the finding.  (As in virtually every film in which they appear, the Catholic hierarchy is portrayed as an assortment of nefarious, two-faced, worldly villains whose only goal is to maintain their power at any and all costs).  The injection of Father Gutierrez into Sharon's world leads to a few insightful clashes between science on the one hand and faith on the other - as well as a lot of predictable romantic palaver between the two principals.  The movie does address the issue of whether or not a person's faith in God (or Christianity in general) would somehow be annihilated if the resurrection could be proved a falsehood.  Derek Jacoby, as a dedicated archaeologist/priest, answers that question one way, while Father Gutierrez answers it another.  The film also makes an effort to explore the psyche of the dedicated archaeologist who puts all her faith in reason and has none left over for God.  She also realizes that she has the power to thrust the world into a spiritual turmoil the likes of which it has never seen before - and she begins to question whether even her own dedication to truth and science can justify such an act.
At such times, the film has a certain ring of truth about it.  But, perhaps through fear of stepping on too many toes or seeing too many picketers outside the theatres, McCord keeps cutting away from the central story to feature a truly ludicrous and uninteresting subplot about a group of Palestinian terrorists who are attempting to ""kidnap"" the remains so they can be used as the ultimate bargaining chip should the Catholic Church decide to support Israel in keeping Jerusalem out of Palestinian hands.  (McCord seems less concerned about Palestinian protestors than Christian ones).  Thus, at crucial moments when the film seems finally to be engaging its complex theme, we are deflected into the mundane world of action cinema filled with such staples as car chases, shoot outs, slow motion explosions etc.  This is an insult both to the profundity of the story and the sensibilities of the audience.
So will ""The Body"" ultimately offend its most devout viewers, those who may find that even suggesting such a possibility as the film posits qualifies as blasphemy of the highest order?  I really can't speak for them.  All I know is that, as a spiritually dispassionate moviegoer who appreciates a provocative theme when it comes along, ""The Body,"" thanks to its overall muffing of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity  - for what filmmaker is ever going to want to tackle this subject again? - offends me for a great many other reasons.",994809600,17,5253,4.837988826815643
1431283,3,B00005JD5M,"I was drawn to this film by its interesting ""What If"" premise.  Banderas plays a Jesuit priest comissioned by the Vatican to debunk the possibility that the body of Christ has been found in an excavated tomb in Jerusalem, the validity of which could obviously be disasterous to the Church if it is proved that the Resurrection was just a myth as suggested by the skeletal remains indicating that Jesus was merely just a man.  With this kind of theological dillema, the plot sets up a great conflict not only for Banderas as Father Matt Gutierrez who struggles against his faith from the subjective truth that could be revealed, but the implication it will have for Israel between the Christians, the Jews, and the Moslems all fighting for control of the Holy Land.  Unfortunately, as is the case with just about any film that touches on religious subject matter, it never has a chance to answer any of the big questions it asks from the start.  By the time the film ends, we know nothing more about ""Dem Bones"" then we did from the beginning (Alpha and Omega) which can lead one to draw their only conclusions or beliefs about the validity of The Body, but what more could you really be expecting... the Second Coming?  The problem with religious films is that they usually try to lure you into the theater under false pretense with the dramatic premise, then try to beat you over the head with a proverbial Bible to convert the audience to their ideology (i.e. The Judas Project and The Omega Code).  Fortunately, this is not the case with The Body.  The film's mediocrity is probably attributed mostly to its low-budget feel and production value.  I was excited to see Vilmos Zsigmond credited as the Director of Photography but completely forget about him while watching the film.  I was disappointed because a cinematographer of his repertoire (Close Encounters, Deliverance) could have given this film just the atmospheric lift it needed in support of the dramatic subject.  Gladiator alumns, Derek Jacobi and John Schrapnel are aptly cast in supporting roles reminiscent of their conspiring Roman Senators Gracchus and Gaius from Gladiator.  Even with a star like Banderas attached, you can tell that no studio wanted to touch this and it is evident from the lack of theatrical distribution and marketing support for the film.  The Body came and went in theaters and no one ever knew or will probably ever care.  Perhaps that, in itself, is a bigger statement about society's genuine interest in religious hypothesis.",994723200,10,2523,4.853146853146853
1431284,4,B00005JD5M,"I rented this movie because Antonio Banderas played the lead male character.  I was basically expecting another movie on the level of The Mask of Zorro or The Thirteenth Warrior.  What I didn't expect was the intensity to which I would be glued to the t.v. set.  Especially since he was not portrayed as a sexy leading man figure.  I was blown away by the story line and the performances by all the actors involved.  The political and religious views were very well expressed and came across in such a way to really make you stop and think about the world wide repercussions that could develop should such an event occur.  I personally stayed on the edge of my seat until the very end of this movie.  I recommend it to anyone not looking for a mindless, pretty faced, lovey dovey flick.  It is one that you will find worthy to tell your friends about.",994636800,3,851,4.445161290322581
1431285,4,B00005JD5M,I saw this movie a week a go and I think its a great movie because if you are a catholic it could confuse you and also you start to think what would happen if Jesus do not resurrected.  You can see in this movie how a priest lose his faith in Jesus.,989280000,3,249,3.69811320754717

1431327,3,B00005JD5M,"I ended up disappointed by this movie.  It was okay, but it wasn't good.  I can't blame it on the acting as that was good and the concept was brilliant, so I guess it was the script itself.  The plot started off interesting as an Israeli archeologist begins exploring the contents of a forgotten tomb that was uncovered when a man began digging in the ground at the back of his store to put in a basement.  Little does he know that this will end up being a huge religious and political problem due to the speculation that the bones found in the tomb, laid out behind a secret wall with a ancient oil lamp and vessel that might have held anointing oil, are possibly that of an un-risen Jesus.  The Vatican is, of course, very concerned about this potential discovery and send a priest (played by Antonio Banderas) to check in on things and oversee what is going on.

Sounds, good...but the plot becomes more and more muddled as local groups from terrorists to Orthodox Jews all become involved for various reasons and the story eventually devolves into one of kidnapping and shooting and bombs.  This could have been a good movie that revolved around the question of faith in light of scientific evidence that shows that a core belief might well be historically false.  It could have shown more of a test of faith for the Catholic Church and the priest send to the tomb and could have gone in a new and interesting way that would have left one wondering and thinking about whether faith needs a basis in historical fact or if the teachings and the story are what is really important, after all...but instead it sidestepped the whole question in the end and left me very disappointed.  It made me feel like the writer/director feared to go where they should have gone and so wrapped things up without resolving much of anything.  It felt like a cop-out.  I also didn't really believe that they could have kept any of this under wraps from the world media, so that fell flat, as well.

Worth watching maybe the one time, but not a keeper.  I'm glad I didn't pay too much for it.",1455235200,,2075,4.486702127659575

The move is about character, dialog, and plot.  What a unique and rare thing.

Bandaras does a better than good job in the lead, and the secondary actors put in polished performances.

Yes, this is a bit of a Catholic basher as it makes them look scheming so, if you are a catholic you might find that a bit of a turn off, and maybe even offensive.  However, not all of the catholic characters are that way.  I put the catholic part this way, it makes catholics look good, but the catholic church look bad.

This story involves what happens when a grave is discovered that MAY contain the body of Christ.  Banderas is the Catholic priest sent by the Vatican to prove that it is NOT.  (It is feared that The Church could not survive such a shocking paradigm shift.)  The plot also addresses the ongoing war between the Palistinians & Jews - & terrorists.

1431447,4,B00005JD5M,"This film that was released years before ""The DaVinci Code"" is little known, but similarly mysterious and controversial.

""The Body"" stars Antonio Banderas as the priest assigned to investigate a risky archeological discovery that threathens his faith, not to mention the entire Church. Banderas delivers a solid and convincing performance as a doubting believer. Opposite his character is Olivia Williams; the ambitious archeologist with no regard for Christianity, and what chaos her findings may cause. The film features plenty of mystery, as well as portrays the heated political climate in Jerusalem, which adds both tension and depth to the plot.

Unlike ""the DaVinci Code"", ""The Body"" stays closer to actual historical facts, and stays somewhat faithful to the Bible as well. It might make the story less complex, but more believable, and treats the religious groups represented respectfully and diplomatically.

1431451,5,B00005JD5M,"This story starts out with the discovery of a body, in an underground tomb, behind a deli, in Jerusalem.  Because of the condition of the skeleton and artifacts found with it, the world of ""christianity"" is knocked on its ear.

The characters, situations, and results are well fleshed out and believable.  The people are a single mother, a reformed mercenary, the Israelis and the Palestinians, a priest who has built his religious house on sand, the Catholic Church, and the everyday people (including the viewer) who are caught in the middle.  I have seen this movie twice - once with some girl friends (it was all about Antonio) and then with a mixed group of friends.  Some people will miss the actual story completely, and some will come away with more than they imagined.  I found the movie exciting and intriguing.  One thing (if you do get the story), by the end you will know if you (or your friends) really do have faith or if you are just members of some denominational group locked into doctrine and ritual.",1143676800,3,1019,4.659217877094972
1431452,4,B00005JD5M,"First, let me say in response to some of the other reviews here that the movie does come to a resolution on whether ""the body"" is actually Christ.  You have to pay close attention near the end, but the resolution is there, and it is quite definite.

As a Christian and deeply religious man, I came to this movie with rather low expectations.  Most of the time such movies treat religion and faith rather superficially.  Maybe it was because of my low expectations, but I came away from this movie quite surprised.  It treats the Christian faith with a great deal of respect, even in the midst of posing a difficult question.  It is amazing to me that someone in Hollywood understood faith enough to create the character Antonio Banderas plays.  Of course, a great deal of this comes from Antonio himself.  His emotions and responses were truly authentic and genuine.  At least, when I imagine myself in his place, I believe I would have responded similarly.

Because this movie is set in Israel, it had to wade through much more than Christian faith.  Movies set in the Middle East tend to either become one dimensional or gloss over the many complicated issues.  Now, I am not familiar with life in Israel these days - except for what I see in the media, which I suspect does not portray life there with much accuracy - so I cannot know if the movie handled all these other issues with as much respect as it handled the issue of faith.  Of course, no movie could go into such complicated conflicts with much detail, there just isn't time - so, in my mind, the key is not so much depth, but respect of the subject.  However, it did seem to me that the movie avoided stereotyping the main characters.  By this I mean it didn't make all Jews the same, all Arabs the same, and all Christians the same.  The main characters were each their own person.  You see this near the end when the shopkeeper gives his life to defend the archeologist.

I give this movie 4 stars because it was thought provoking to me, and I was pleasantly surprised by the content.  I cannot give it 5 stars as the technical quality of the film does not warrant it.  At times it has the feel of a low budget film.",1142553600,3,2183,4.423558897243108

  The Body has very little in the way of extras and bonus materials, having only two trailors and a filmography of banderras.  Still a good movie, and at the very least worth a rental.",1075248000,4,663,4.248
1431477,2,B00005JD5M,"The premise is fascinating.  What if the body of Jesus were discovered?  Of course, the discovery would call into question the resurrection, a key element of Christian (and particularly Catholic) dogma.  The questions it would raise are many.  How would the Catholic church react to the discovery?  How might an individual believer react?  Perhaps as importantly, how might outsiders treat this discovery if one of the consequences might be the unhinging of the entire Catholic Church?  Certainly, some would invite that result (couldn't you see Osama licking his lips at the thought?); others, seeing the Church as a principal player in the battle with Islam, might think otherwise.
So where does The Body go wrong?  The answer, unfortunately, is ""let me count the ways.""  What is right about the movie is the casting.  Banderas is his usual compelling, understated presence as a good-hearted priest weighed down by a troubled past.  He is just the kind of character actor for a role like this, as he navigates the terrain between his own beliefs and the Vatican.  Olivia Williams, as an Israeli archaeologist behind the discovery, was also a terrific choice for her role.  She is attractive enough to create the possibility of sparks to develop with Banderas' character.  (Unfortunately, one of the real problems with this movie is its inability to develop these interpersonal issues with any degree of depth or drama.  I suspect it was the directing, but it also might have been a lack of chemistry between Banderas and Williams.  A wonderful backdrop to the plot would have been a well-executed demonstration of all the personal dominoes that might begin to fall as a priest's faith is shaken.  Unfortunately, we don't really get to see that in Banderas' character, even though Banderas has shown us glimmers of such potential in other roles.)  And what happened to Derek Jacobi?  Frankly, I expected a deep penetrating performance, even with the thinly written--and somewhat silly--affectations given to his character.
The worst thing about The Body, aside from its inability to rise to the challenges of its story, is the mediocre directing.  You can see it, in part, in the actors' performances, as I noted above.  But it is also present in the sloppy and confusing images, including a particularly inept sequence when Jacobi's character finally gives up hope that the body is someone other than Jesus.  One might, to be generous, suggest that this sequence has a dreamy, hallucinogenic quality to it.  To me, it just sucks.
And then there's the torrent of cliches--the utra-orthodox Jews who let a priest instruct them on the Torah; the slimy Vatican types who are more interested in running the Church as a bank, than expressing any real religious belief; the terrorist bent on using the body as a bargaining chip; and, finally, the tacky disclosure to the audience of the Truth.
I'd love to have Hollywood try its hand at this movie again, with a much better script and a seasoned director of serious movies.  Or maybe not.",1069372800,2,3033,4.9840954274353875
1431478,4,B00005JD5M,"I'd take issue with the reviewers here who have said that The Body was just a fuzzy muddle of religion and theology.
There is nothing quite shimmering about any ONE element of the movie, not Banderas, not Olivia Williams. It is the whole premise, and the thought-provoking + sensibly handled storyline that carries the movie. It is not a doozy spin. Everything from archaelogical science to the Gospels to the Bible to Talmud (Orthodox) makes into the intelligent dialog, and there are points where you can savor some pithy but patient debate.
At one point in the movie, a publisher of a theological journal says ""Religion is not based on a rational system of facts. It is driven by human needs."" Such is unfortunately the nature of the beast, this is why movies with textured topical themes (such as The Life of David Gale) do not ring at the boxoffice.
It is easy to see why this did not do well with ordinary international audiences -- it braces difficult questions. To add to its woes, it was released around the touchy times of 2001 when Israel/Palestine/Christianity was the last thing that the world was interested in.
Overall, although the movie meanders a little in the second half, it does a fantastic job of illustrating the fear and loathing that is rife in our world today, and how very trivial some of these issues really are. Still, millions hang by these simple notions. Maybe open-mindedness is what is needed to appreciate this movie for what it was intended to be.
The only minor grouse I have was the rushed, half-baked denouement. Kind of killed the beauty of the movie as a whole.
Oh, and it is also an action movie. Action against breath-taking backdrops of Jerusalem.
Highly recommended!",1066867200,9,1711,4.764309764309765
1431479,2,B00005JD5M,"The premise looks interesting; the location is authentic, and we got actors like Olivia Williams (sorry, but I went to see HER, not Banderas).  But I wasn't impressed simply because it doesn't know how to deal with this kind of delicate subject matter, namely the faith and religion.
The initial setting goes this way: an archaeologist Olivia Williams finds the skelton at the back of hardware store in Jerusalem, and it could be the body of Jesus Christ.  A priest (and former soldier in the Middle America) is sent to the site, to investigate the case, but his work is hindered, or used, by the local powers in Israel and Palestine that try to take advantage of the situation, which might change the history of Christianity.
So far, so good, even though we realize by now that the subject matter requires the most careful handling, not only because it touches religious matters, but because it needs extraordinarily minute descriptions of scientific knowledge if they really try to prove what those characters are trying to prove.  And as for the latter, the film shows some respect to archaeologist's techiniques, not ignoring detailed methods they employ.
However, the film fails to develop the knowledge to anything.  The tempo is too slow, and the characters are nothing but clithed types: politicians are dirty, priests are plotting, and so on and on.  The conflicting religion-science relation that could be intriguing is dumped on the way to the obligatory shoot-out actions at the final reel of the film.  Maybe we should not quote the on-going things in the Middle East, but looking at the tragic events among the Jewish and Arabian people, I cannot but feel this film oversimplifies the complicated political issues there.  At least, they could have, and should have made it more intellectually stimulating, and in that case only, they are justified in using this rather daring premise.
There are some good things, though.  The moody photography of Vilmos Zsigmond (""Dear Hunter""""Close Encounter"") effectively catches the atomosphere of the town, and good supporting cast include Jason Flemmying and Derek Jacobi.  But it is Muhamed Bakri as intimidating Abu Yosef who really steals the show.
Finally, leading actors.  You know the career of Antonio Banderas since his enchanting ""Zorro,"" and I won't repeat it any more.  His character is not convincing, but he is not to be blamed.  His charisma and charm are certainly here, but the film squanders them away in its mundane course.  Olivia Williams, the only good thing in Kevin Costner's ""Postman,"" is slightly better, but her role looks also filled with the stock images of hardworking female scholar from the films in the past.  When she can't save the film, no one can.",1035244800,5,2736,4.997797356828194
1431480,5,B00005JD5M,"I never would have expected to find such a deep message about faith in such a secular movie, but The Body was better than I heard it was. The movie is about an Israeli archaeologist who believes she has found the body of Christ hidden in an ancient secret tomb behind a rich man's tomb, her theory being that the disciples hid the body in the secret tomb and continued to proclaim that Christ rose from the dead. Antonio Banderas plays a Catholic priest sent by the Vatican to prove that it isn't Christ's body.
And this movie has a lot. It goes deep into the attention to the details of Christ's death as recorded in the gospels. It touches on the Shroud of Turin. It explains various archaeological methods of dating. It has characters from Christian, Jewish, and Islamic backgrounds, and it deals with the questions of religion v. politics v. science as well as faith v. evidence, and also, was Christ only a good man and a good teacher, or was He God? Is that important? Plus, it's got a good deal of modern Hebrew in it (being a student of modern Hebrew, that got me really excited). The heated discussions between Catholic Antonio Banderas and his agnostic archaeologist counterpart are engaging, and I found myself enjoying his ""subtle style of Jesuitical debate.""
But what impressed me most was that this movie could say so many nice things about Jesus. I thought that Hollywood wouldn't let the J-word onto the big screen unless it was to take it in vain, but this movie goes against that trend.
If I have one fault to pick with this movie, it's that, in the end, it doesn't offer a very favorable portrayal of the Catholic church, and I'm quite tired of seeing Catholics portrayed as the bad guys. Still, this movie has enough originality and intrigue about it to warrant five stars.

  But one of the reviewers mentioned that the ending of the movie was ambiguous so I decided that perhaps it contained some redeeming qualities after all.
  You can read the other reviews for a synopsis of the plot, I won't try to repeat it again here.

What more could you ask from a movie?
  It was a bit heavy-handed at times with certain situations, which I won't reveal.

1431482,4,B00005JD5M,"I have passed this DVD on the shelves at my local video store countless times.  I thought it was a thriller and well, Antonio Banderas in a lead role?  I continued to pass it over.  Finally, I read a review on this movie and got some insight into the plot (thanks to top reviewer Carol Irvin).  The movie is a great big ""What-If"" concerning the vailidity of Christ.  Now I must say up front...I do study different religions, but as a Christian myself, this movie was more than just thought provoking, it stirred some really scary emotions within me. I feel it necessary to warn those out there who get nervous about religious artifacts and the scandals over gene testing such things...this movie can be a really difficult to watch.  Be cautious.
  The premise of the movie begins with a young archeologist, played by Olivia Williams opening a tomb in Jersalem, which appears at first glance to be the tomb of the risen Christ. (gotta be up on your Bible to follow what is going on here).  The tomb is that of a rich man, and the bed lay empty as dipicted the way it should be from scriptures.  A coin is found on the floor that is dated to 32 A.D. - the exact date of Christ's burial.  At first glance, this seems to be the holy tomb of Christ himself...a most miraculous discovery for the Christian Faith.  There is just one major problem.  The back wall of the tomb is not original to the outer tomb.  The wall is removed and there lies the skeletal remains of a man who has been crucified, and laid to rest.
  From this point on, the movie changes beat. The Vatican and other politicians get involved.  Tests are done and it seems the closer they come to figuring out if it is the unrisen body of Christ, Holy wars begin to break out. The basic question to this movie is to ask yourself (no matter what your religion or faith)...what happens to all if this is found to be the bones of Jesus Christ?  If Christ and God were one, what will all of humanity feel at the expense of determining the identity of the body.  Antonio Banderas is believable and gives a surprising performance as the Vatican's undercover priest sent to investigate the tomb.  The movie moves more quickly than I imagined and has a great shock ending.  I can see this movie being an exceptional, emotional ride for someone of any faith.

Yet the premise of this movie is the very reason I picked it off the shelf (fully expecting to be offended by it). Surprisingly, I found no reason to be offended at any turn, except perhaps by the careful scripting that sidesteps many serious political and religious issues in order not to offend anyone. I must applaud the writers of this screenplay for the way they avoided painting any ethnic group or religious sect as the bad guys, while dealing with a hot topic in a location where such unrest has sprung from the religious, cultural, and ancestoral differences of the people. At the same time, I found it unsettling that the creators of this movie were disinclined to take a solid stance on any of the many issues that the script touches.
From an experiential stand point, this movie was salvaged primarily by the excellent cinematography, featuring breath-taking shots of Jerusalem and the surrounding countryside, along with the talent-laden acting skills of Antonio Banderas, Olivia Williams, and their superb supporting cast.

I think, for the most part, the film depicted Christians respectfully (which is usually most lacking in Hollywood), and that is one feature I appreciated about it.

7938731,2,B00005JD5M,"First I want to say Catholicism is not true Christianity it is considered a Christian cult not just because of its unbiblical  practices, idols and rituals but mostly because it has more ways to Heaven than Christ alone in its doctrinal statement.

THE BODY is a compelling drama about the possible discovery of Jesus Christs bones in a hidden tomb in Jerusalem. Its also an exciting thriller that takes several edge-of-your-seat twists and turns until it arrives at a pro-Christian ending that affirms faith in the Christs Resurrection and Deity. Regrettably, the ending also unfairly attacks the Roman Catholic church and its hierarchy and has a non-biblical view of Christianitys role in politics. Also, probably because the subject matter and the movies final affirmation of Christian faith are controversial, the movie is only playing in a limited American release so far.
Antonio Banderas stars in THE BODY as Roman Catholic priest Father Matt Gutierrez. A top Vatican cardinal assigns Father Matt to investigate the reported finding of a crucified body in a walled off section of a rich mans tomb in Jerusalem. Israeli officials force the female archeologist who discovered the body to work with Father Matt as he investigates her findings before she can publish her paper on them. Hampering their investigation are some Jewish and Arab radicals who desperately want to find out whats going on for political and religious reasons. Violence eventually erupts.
THE BODY goes through several twists and turns as Father Matt and the archeologist probe the artifacts in the tomb and the body. Evidence mounts that the body may indeed be that of Jesus Christ, until a final twist proves otherwise. The movie closes by quoting John 20: 29, Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed. Also, as a couple people note during the rest of the movie, the Resurrection is an important proof of the Deity of Jesus Christ. Thus, Father Matt retains his faith in the Resurrection and the Deity of Jesus Christ, a faith which, as the movie clearly points out, is essential to Christianity. As Paul firmly says in 1 Cor. 15:14, If Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith.
Regrettably, however, there are some anti-Christian elements at the end of the movie.
First, one Catholic priest commits suicide when the evidence seems to suggest at one point that the body is in fact that of Jesus Christ. Secondly, Father Matt goes back to Rome and accuses the cardinal who sent him of manipulating the situation while risking peoples lives. He then resigns the priesthood, saying that he will now serve God in my own way, whatever that means. Finally, Father Matts experience in Jerusalem confirms his belief that God has no place whatsoever in politics. This belief is an unbiblical one that contradicts such Bible passages as Proverbs 28:2-4 and 29:4, which urge governmental rulers to maintain order justly, to follow Gods moral principles and to avoid oppressing the poor. Furthermore, Romans 13:36 says that government officials and other authorities, whether elected or not, are ministers and servants of God who punish and restrain wrongdoers and who commend or praise those who do good works according to the moral principles of God.
Despite these problems, THE BODY ultimately takes a positive approach to Christian faith in general. Not only does it affirm that faith with an important Bible verse at the end, it also shows how important the Resurrection of Jesus Christs body and the Deity of Jesus Christ is to Christians. As Thomas exclaims to the resurrected Christ just before the John 20:29 passage quoted by the movie, My Lord and my God!
THE BODY could have been much stronger, of course, in both its Christian worldview and its execution. It is a little contrived in spots. Some events in fact don't quite make sense when you think about them after the movie is over. Even so, Antonio Banderas does an excellent job as Father Matt. Although Roman Catholic viewers will be upset, perhaps extremely so, that he decides to leave the priesthood at the end, his portrayal is a strongly positive one in general. Also, he is ably supported by Olivia Williams as the chain-smoking female archeologist and by Derek Jacobi as a priest with an expertise in archeology.

Here's a negative review that I really cant argue with;

I was surprised to see a favorable review While the individual parts of this film may not be offensive, the overall message is on a par with The Last Temptation of Christ. its just done in a more subtle way. Under the pretty exterior, this is one nasty and subversive film. The message of the movie is that Christ did not really arise from the dead, but instead was secretly buried and his body was recently found. It pits science against religion, a tactic typically employed by secular humanists and evolutionists. Then it say that it does not really matter that Christ is not risen and in fact our faith has nothing to do with reality but is only belief, so finding the body of Christ is not a problem except for the Vatican and various political power groups. The movie portrays the protagonists in a sympathetic light and quotes scripture passages to masquerade as a Christian film. And then the evidence is destroyed so that people can continue their faith. The only person who understands the implications of devoting his whole life to a lie (faith in the living Christ) is the priest who commits suicide. And he is portrayed as a borderline lunatic. At the end we are assured that everyone has their own god, and isn't that nice? Faith and reality need not be in conflict. I happen to believe in the real god who created the universe. He is not just a belief which has nothing to do with scientific reality. The whole premise of this film is to say What if Jesus didn't really arise from the dead?. The films answer: Scientifically he didnt, but that doesnt matter. Talk about using a lie to undermine peoples faith I challenge you to watch this film, consider the implications and then ask yourself whether this film is of God or of Satan.
