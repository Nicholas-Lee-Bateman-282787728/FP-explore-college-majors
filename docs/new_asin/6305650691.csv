1074962,5,6305650691,This video is a great weight and conditioning video. It works for all fitness levels.  The fast paced and fun team give you a good solid weight program in 30 minutes.  I love it.  The cuing in flawless and the routines challenging yet easy to follow.  You can play this video again and again and you will never get tired.,980380800,4,321,4.3
1074963,5,6305650691,"After having done the Tae Bo series for some time, it's been more difficult finding a workout video that isn't too easy.  Tae Bo is very rigorous, and after you've become accustomed to its pace and its workout, it's not easy to find something that's as challenging and that gets your heart rate up just as easily.  I've only watched this Boot Camp video once so far, and it was great.  It had me sweating in no time, but it wasn't difficult to follow or annoying in any way.  That's another thing - Billy Blanks is a pleasure to watch because he doesn't say stupid things or giggle or get on your nerves. I was afraid this tape might, as the lady on the cover looks like she might be ditsy and annoying.  But it's not like that at all.  You get a really good workout that combines both cardio and muscle toning, just about all of your muscle groups get attention, and there are differing intensities.  If you're a beginner you will still be able to follow and pace yourself, if you're used to Tae Bo you just tighten up and work it out!  I plan to stick with this video on a regular basis until I've seen it so much I can't bear to watch anymore ;)",977443200,10,1148,4.210045662100456
1074964,5,6305650691,"I was very careful selecting this video.  I am a couch potato and needed something to get me moving, but hated the floor covering steps of aerobics.  This video strings good old-fashioned calisthenics together with vaguely aerobic moves, not a whole lot of space needed!  Lots of push ups and sit ups!  You will need dumbells - I started with 2lbs, and have moved up to 5!  Very even workout without being a killer - just about the time I started hoping it would finish soon, PRESTO, she starts stretching.  Easy to up the intensity or to lower it.  If you couch potatoes (aka computer junkies) can get motivated enough to put in the tape, you won't regret it!",971222400,15,660,4.495798319327731
1074965,5,6305650691,"This tape has a good combination of aerobic and strength work, and the cueing is superb.  She's always reminding us to ""apply the movement to the muscle"" and then gives examples like ""move ribs to hips.""  For once on a home tape I felt certain I had proper form on even the first few workouts.  The energy is always high and the pace is fast.  I look forward to my Boot Camp workouts!  But as a previous reviewer mentioned, this is a challenge to beginners and intermediate levels, but if you've been seriously working out for a while, it may not be a challenge unless you up the weights.",969926400,,588,4.3577981651376145
1074966,5,6305650691,"As a person who has a VERY difficult time staying motivated, I can honestly say that I love this workout.  Sue keeps the energy up and really makes you work, but it never gets boring.  I sweat, I do push-ups  (miracle!), I feel strong.  In two weeks, I've already done this one a lot  more than some videos I have owned for years.  Also, there are lower-impact  variations included.  My new favorite, a highly recommended quick fix!",961113600,9,432,4.51948051948052
1074967,5,6305650691,"As an avid exerciser, I own over 50 exercise videos.  This video is my absolute favorite by far.  I enjoy the combination of cardio with strength training, which has proven to be extremely effective.  I also like the  energy that Sue and the other exercisers display in the video. It's a  short, effective, fun workout!  Doing the video at least 3 times a week has  definitely increased my energy and strength.  I can honestly say that I now  love push ups.  You will not be disappointed with Crunch Boot Camp!",960681600,14,510,4.566666666666666
1074968,4,6305650691,"I bought this tape on the spur of the moment, and have never regretted the purchase.  Advanced exercisers may find it a little monotonous, but it's a quick, thorough workout that makes you sweat.  Sue Hitzman, the instructor,  keeps up the energy and doesn't overdo it with the boot camp cliches.  And  she's right--there is nothing better than a good booty stretch!  I don't  own many videos, but this is definitely my favorite.",953337600,,429,4.794520547945205
1074969,4,6305650691,"I really enjoyed the video!  Crunch has not dissapointed me yet.  It is a hard video and I'd advise to watch it a couple times before attempting to do it. There are a lot of push-ups involved so be warned.  But it is a fun  video and Crunch has once again chosen a ""down-to-earth""  instructor that doesn't intimidate.",947721600,7,317,4.396551724137931
1074970,4,6305650691,"This is a great intermediate-level tape that combines strength training with some aerobic moves to give you a complete workout in just 35 minutes.  I've been doing video workouts for the past seven years, and have over 30  in my collection to provide variety, and I just love the Crunch videos.  There is a ton of variety in the workout - lots of add-ons to a simple move  building to a combo, and it got my heart pumping and raised a sweat.  Highly recommended.",947116800,12,462,4.4523809523809526
1074971,1,6305650691,I do Tae Bo Advanced series and I thought I might give this a try to add some variety.  I had NO problem w/ it.  It was very easy and just too basic.  I have been working out for about 2 years and it just wasn't enough  challenge.  If you are a beginner this might be for you--but the more  advanced stay away!,942019200,35,310,3.8412698412698414

1075133,5,6305650691,"I worked out to this for the first time today and I really love it as it is fast paced and covers cardio and toning needs with a super instructor who makes it fun. This is about 35 minutes and so there are really no excuses to not exercise and as I am close to 50 with fibromyalgia if I can do it anybody can. I have exercised for most of my adult life and so I am very fit but anyone can achieve this by doing something everyday even if it is only 10 minutes.  It all adds up and you get progressively fitter. I use these shorter workouts when I am having a fibro flare up and it gets me thru until the tough times pass. Anyway this is fun, fast moving and never boring so I would give it a try!",1427068800,,696,3.8333333333333335

1075136,5,6305650691,"Great workout!  I just ordered my second DVD of this workout.  My first one I have had now for about 13 years and I wanted a second one just in case my first one dies on me. This is a great workout to add to some cardio. Sometimes I will do Cardio for about 10-20 mins first and then pop this in depending on my time, when I do that I skip the warm up.  For the past 13 years I find myself returning to this video and it stays in my rotation to keep things fresh at home. You will need some hand held weights.",1414195200,,509,3.7830188679245285
1075137,4,6305650691,Fun and fast workout. Really works every part of your body and is only about 24 minutes long (not including the warm down).,1411862400,,123,4.391304347826087
1075138,5,6305650691,"This is a great workout. Few workouts make me more sore than this one when I haven't done it in awhile.

1075140,5,6305650691,"I used this years ago (VHS) and had great results. I was excited and couldn't wait to start it again. It's a quick, 30 minute full body workout that is perfect for my in-between days or on days I just want a quick and effective workout. I also like that it moves from exercise to exercise smoothly but quick so there is no time to get bored. When the cool down comes you literally think.. ""It's already been 30 minutes?""

1075234,4,6305650691,"I'm a big fan of the Crunch Fitness workout series. This DVD is a great quick workout. I prefer interval training. This DVD mixes cardio with weights, incorporating moves that are all very simple, yet effective. The coach is good as well, she doesn't have a whiny voice like some instructors! The bootcamp theme is a little cheesy, but not obnoxious.",1375142400,,350,4.754098360655738
1075235,5,6305650691,"I really like this work out.  I am a beginning exerciser. The first time I did the workout, I wasn't able to make it all the way through, but each time I try it again, I can see how I am getting stronger and stronger.",1375056000,,217,3.8222222222222224
1075236,5,6305650691,"I have been using this workout video off and on for a number of years. I have the VHS version and purchased this DVD for a second home. Many other workout videos have come and gone for me, but I keep returning to this one.

As background information, I am a 57-year-old woman who has been using weights and working out fairly regularly for 12 years.

This is, as the instructor indicates, a ""high intensity workout."" If that's not for you, however, there is one woman doing a no-impact version.

As is the case with most of my workout videos, this one does not indicate what size weights the participants are using. Instead, the instructor says ""every time pick up heavier weights."" Based on that, I am now using 200-pound weights (LOL). But seriously, I use 7- and 8-pound weights.

One of the things I like about this video is that when the instructor tells us to be on our left leg, she is on her right leg (and vice versa), so that we are doing the mirror image of her. Also, she always does the same number of reps on each leg, as opposed to other workout videos I use. I also like how the instructor combines high-energy work outs with sculpting.  There are times when she is stationary using the weights, and I combine it with some footwork to keep my intensity high.

This video is just 30 minutes long, from warm-up to cool down. There was a time when I didn't do this video much because most of my videos were 60-minutes long. These days, however, I walk 4 miles most days and do yoga workouts. But it's still important to do weight workouts so I'm doing this one more often now.",1374796800,4,1589,4.3694915254237285

1075238,4,6305650691,"This is another great Crunch workout, no nonsense just good old fashioned sweating.

I love interval training, I hate strength training and with interval I get the strength portion in and yet get some good old fashioned cardio as well.  Like all boot camp style workouts, be prepared for squats, lunges and pushups, all combined with weights.  You can make this workout as easy or as hard as you like by lowering or raising the amount of weight you use.  At around 30 minutes, it's not long but intense enough that you will work up a sweat and you will burn a decent amount of calories.  I'm over 50 (o.k. closer to 60) and an intermediate level and had no problem following this workout.

I love the Crunch workouts and just wish they hadn't stopped doing them, they are all fairly easy to follow, give you a good workout and the instructors don't scream at you.  This is a keeper.",1367971200,,882,4.475

1075345,4,6305650691,"I ordered this DVD to add to my Crunch Fitness library. It is a great workout that gets you sweating a bit. Since it only is about 30 minutes long, it is good when you want to get in a quick workout. I wish the muscle toning sections had more reps to work up a burn. I am an advanced exerciser and found this DVD pretty good. However, if you are looking for some hard core sweating, this may not be the DVD for you.

However, I like to use this workout when I need an easy day.  It is a fun workout with great cues!  It is a great mix of alternating cardio w/weight bearing exercises.  It is only 30 min long.  When you need to squeeze in a workout, its ok.  I consider myself an intermediate ""athlete""  ...  this does not OVERLY challenge me to complete this workout, but I like to use it when I need an easier day.

As if you could really make it through the army's boot camp after completing a 30 minute workout video...  Then again, I've yet to find a workout video that didn't have a cheesy, uber-perky instructor.  That said, this a surprisingly effective video if you want a quick, full body workout.  It includes hand weights and cardio so it gets your heart rate up and tones your upper and lower body.  If you are an inactive or lightly active person, you WILL feel it the next day in your shoulders and legs because of the squats, lunges and hand weights.  I love it because after 2 months I started noticing a tighter butt and awesome little biceps and I have NEVER been a toned person in my life!  My secret was doing this 2 times a week with P90X Cardio or Kenpo in between and adding more fresh veggies and greens to my diet.",1344556800,,940,4.430232558139535
1075353,5,6305650691,"I often pick this workout over others because I know I can get a great workout in 30 minutes.  It is FUN and it goes fast.  If you want more challenge in the weight lifting segments, use heavier weights.  Don't take this too seriously.  This is workout studio boot camp, not military boot camp.

It was mainly floor work and arms/weights interleaved with some short aerobic-style sequences, but not enough aerobics to do the job -- get the heart rate up and keep it up.  I guess ""boot camp"" is appropriate if you remember the old idea of boot camp being all pushups and situps ... but I was expecting an aerobics routine.",1306195200,,467,4.8125

I was so disappointed when I didn't feel the burn later that day or the next day. The push ups in the workout were awesome, and I still didn't hurt.

When it came out on DVD I snapped it up. Can't believe that after all this time, it's still fun and invigorating. Instructor is wonderful. Workout is so ingeniously designed -- not a minute wasted. Creative twists keep the moves fun (e.g., interesting variations on the arms during jumping jacks). The flow of the sequences is well-crafted and seamless.

1075619,2,6305650691,"I honestly cannot stand this workout. The trainer was so bad on cueing and the camera didn't even do a good job on shooting people that 1) were even in time or knew what they were doing and 2) were in the middle of the last exercise so knowing when the new move came in with the cue wasn't very easy. She talks a lot during the pushups and I get that it might help some people to get their mind off of it, but i for one don't know what count she is on when I'm face down or at least not in front of my television to do the pushup. She excessively talks during times when she should've cued. I'm a dancer so it's not like I have two left feet or don't know when counts should be coming in but she was just off. I mean the positives of the workout are that she does make you build a sweat and the exercises are challenging (though there aren't many reps so i guess on the good side, it'll burn but not for that long but on the bad side, those muscles don't get worked out after that). I just found the workout to be lacking in something. It felt like a low budget shooting and the people working out didn't even look like they really knew what they were doing. They just didn't look good as a group. For me when the workout is hard, I don't wanna have to spread my mind on how bad a set looks or how not in sync they are or how i'm doing something that i thought she said to do only she was off on timing or her constant jibbering. So if you're the type that doesn't need all the hoorah destractions but want to work up a sweat, I'd say this would be a good choice.

Overall, like I said, good moves, lots of great toning for the arms, variations on pushups and lunges, but I would definitely not seek out this series again for me.

Oh, and just a hint should have come from reading the box when she said vanilla yogurt and cottage cheese with crunchy cereal was the instructor's favorite ""splurge"" food.....REALLY?  Not macaroni and cheese?  Or cheesecake, or pizza?  yogurt and cottage cheese....this should have clued me in that we were definitely not speaking the same language.

Come on- I know this is a boot camp video, but I hardly see it as encouraging when someone calls the audience member by a military name when the target audience is not military people.

It's a very good workout as far as calories lost and fat burned in a short amt. of time.  Having said that, you'd think it's the first DVD I pull off my shelf everyday...well it isn't.  Here's why.

Everyone in the class looks so goofy.  Their workout clothing is terrible and tacky.  The room they are in is so depressing, too. As much as the instructor tries to fire everyone up, I hardly find the rest of the people or place inspiring.  I have a home gym with lots of windows.  The dark studio the video is completely the opposite!

I have another CRUNCH DVD which I would describe similarly.  One girl in the class looks like Pocahontas!

I would prefer to just have segments.  Like weights, cardio, floorwork.  I do the workout because it's short, so good when I don't have enough time.  I wouldn't repurchase it though.

It may be short but adding intensity would make this routine very effective. I like this a lot 'coz Sue Hitzman covered all the muscle groups. If you don't have an hour for a Jari Love's routine [light weights/high reps], this would still make you feel worked out at the end. As Sue says it, ""every time you do this workout, reach for heavier weights."" I recommend this to those who are short on time but would like an efficient muscle toning routine. There's an average of 8-16 reps per move and overloading the muscles would eventually show definition. Don't worry about bulking up as we hear them say all the time.... getting big is from eating too much of the 'wrong' food and not from lifting heavy weights; we don't have the hormones to bulk up and that's very true.

1075812,5,6305650691,"For the past seven months I've been using the Ellen Barrett Crunch Pilates DVDs (cardio, weights, and slim & sleek) as well as bicycling, so I'm in fairly good shape.  I wanted another DVD to give my body some variety.  I bought this one based on the reviews.

My first impressions was that the warm-up is extremely complicated for someone as uncoordinated as myself, but it gets easier as I learn the moves.  I also felt this DVD wasn't strenuous enough, or that 30 minutes was just not enough time to get a decent workout.  The next morning changed my mind.  Surprisingly, I was definitely sore, particularly in my inner thighs, my shoulders, and even my abs, which I work pretty hard on a consistent basis.  Yeah! (Pain must mean it's working, at least that's what my parents used to say when they put iodine on my scraped knees).

This is a short, intense work-out. I have been pairing it with the abs section of Pick Your Spot Pilates, just because I'm a little obsessive about my mid-section. This is a great workout and I highly recommend it.  I also like that you can use from 3 to 10 pound weights, because I definitely see myself working up to the 10's.  I burn 160 calories during this DVD, and of course, there's supposedly the afterburn calories.

My only issue with this dvd: the other people in the video. They are annoying to the extreme.  Anytime the instructor mentions pushups or any other variation, they moan and groan (sometimes scream) dramatically. Ridiculous. I'm supposed to believe these obviously in shape people are being driven insane by this workout?  Do not insult my intelligence, please.  And that girl in the khaki shorts and blue top in the back needs a punch in the mouth.  Her stupid facial expressions are very annoying.

If you can get past the idiots in the back, this is a good, short, effective workout.",1167696000,6,1846,4.616564417177914

1075887,5,6305650691,"Although I enjoy Pilates and yoga, I need a good workout that makes me sweat.  Boxing and martial arts classes are great for that purpose.  But there are times where I prefer to feel the burn at home.  To that end, one of the best cardio/strength DVD workouts I've found is ""Crunch: Boot Camp Training.""

The workout runs for about 30 minutes, which is great for those days where I want a shorter (but still effective) one.  It's short because exercises are combined together in order to minimize time and maximize benefit.  For example, three-to-ten pound hand weights are used to work the upper body while doing squats and lunges.  Abs and obliques are worked on the floor with different types of crunches, and during standing cardio work by side knee lifts.  Of course, a boot camp workout would be incomplete without pushups - there are three sets, each with a different emphasis to shake things up (and the lower body is worked in as well).  A cooldown/stretch session concludes the proceedings.

As for the instructor, Susan Hitzmann is one of the best I've seen on a DVD workout.  She has an infectious enthusiasm that challenges and encourages at the same time.  She calls well, using a clear and authoritative voice.  I also enjoyed the chemistry between her and the rest of the class.  This is one of the few DVD workouts where I can identify with the assistants, because they look like they are actually working out.  They moan, groan, and laugh like real people, and plastic smiles are kept to a minimum.  Finally, the generic accompanying music complements the workout without overwhelming it.

There are two caveats for ""Crunch: Boot Camp Training.""  First, it might be hard on someone with sensitive knees because there are a lot of squats and forward lunges.  I had an ACL recon years ago, so I usually do backward lunges in place of the forward ones (the workout also features backward lunges).  Also, the routine's fast pace and combinations may confuse or wear out beginners.  But easier variations are demonstrated by a woman on the instructor's left side, so this is a workout you can grow into.  Even so, if your body takes time to get limber due to age or previous injury, you may want to warm up on your own beforehand.

""Crunch: Boot Camp Training"" is an excellent boot camp-style home workout.  I own a large number of exercise DVDs, and this one's on my go-to stack.  Highly recommended!",1152921600,4,2414,4.717703349282297
1075888,5,6305650691,"You can make this workout as easy or difficult as you like by modifying movements and varying weights. I enjoy the instructor's positive energy and sense of humor; it's a great workout to start the day. I was worried that the ""boot camp"" theme would be too prevalent and get old quickly, but it is only mentioned a couple of times.  This is definitely not a beginner's workout, though.  Without some prior instruction on positioning and movement control, it would be easy to be injured doing some of the lunges, squats and arm exercises.",1148515200,,537,4.702127659574468
1075889,4,6305650691,"...but I am blown away by the fact that one of the reviewers did this workout and didn't break a sweat.  I was, quite literally, dripping with perspiration, and I only made it through two-thirds of the workout the first time I tried it.

I AM completely out of shape, but after a recent visit to my doctor, and a lecture on the fact that I am no longer a teenager and have to (1) eat properly and (2) take care of my body by exercising, I am trying to get on the right track.  However, I don't think this DVD was a good place to start.

Not that it's not a good workout--I truly believe once I am in better shape, I will enjoy it.  I like the fact that a lot of the focus is on arms and chest--so many DVDs focus on the hips, thighs, abs, and butt, and it's difficult to find one that will truly help with the jiggle on the underside of the upper arm.  But right now I am not in good enough physical condition to keep up, and it truly is a very difficult workout.

One of my friends, who loves tae-bo and does it religiously, and is in excellent shape, would just love this DVD, so I am going to purchase a copy for her.  In the meantime, finishing this DVD without throwing up or passing out will become my fitness goal.  So if you're a beginner like me, I'd recommend buying the DVD, but don't give up on working out if it's too difficult to complete the first time through.  Completing this workout is something you have to build up to, so don't get frustrated if you can't finish it the first time through.

One caveat--make sure you are in the right position for all of the weightlifting exercises.  Rewind the DVD as many times as you need to, because if your stance is wrong, your lower back will pay for it the next day.",1145577600,9,1728,4.125373134328358
1075890,4,6305650691,"Sue Hitzmann leads this 30 minute video that keeps you moving from beginning to end.  She is joined by women and men all in great shape, including Faith who shows some beginner modifications.

You start with a fun, simple warmup, one of my favorite parts of the workout, then you head right into boot camp training. You start with squats, then overhead presses for shoulders, then you combine both moves.  You squat down first, then press up, then return to stand.  This was hard!  I was using 8 lb weights and quickly had to drop down to 5's, much harder than it looks.  Then you will do some bent over rows, later adding bicep curls and deadlifts before combining all three moves.

Then it's time for the first set of pushups, you will do 12 traditional pushups before moving on to some ab work.  You start with traditional crunches before adding a foot lift, then you will progress into lifting the entire leg up.  Then you will stand up for some jumping jacks, later adding plyos squats which really ups the heartrate.  Then you will do some forward lunges, these are done with a 3 count pulse, alternating legs, then you will jump switch to the other leg, making it tougher.  This didn't feel comfortable for me so I followed Faith for this part.

More upper body work is next, you will combine hammer curls and angled curls for biceps.  Then you will do one arm angled curls, later adding a plie squat.  You will do one side at a time, then alternate sides.  More pushups follow, you start on the knees, then you lift up and go on to your toes, lower to your knees and repeat, later adding alternating glute lifts. Quite challenging.

Then you stand for some standing ab work, knee smashes are the best way to describe them, you will do one side first, then the other before alternating sides.  I liked this move a lot.  The next segment is calf raises/rear lunges.  You will start with calf raises, then add rear lunges alternating legs.  Then you will do more alternating rear lunges, then one side at a time while adding a knee lift, leg extension and a tricep press.  Then you will work the triceps more with a set of double arm kickbacks, then repeat the rear lunge sequence on the other leg.  More tricep kickbacks and french presses complete this segment.

The next segment starts with a move called ""Tap & Touch"".  You shift all your weight on one leg, while the other leg taps front and back.  Then you will do the ""Skate & Slide"", which is self explanatory, later you will add a knee lift, before moving into hops with your knees up high, you will start slowly then go into double time before jogging it out.  Next you will do more shoulder work, starting with rear delt raises and high rows, then you will repeat the Tap/Touch and Skate/Slide sequence on the other side.  More shoulder work follows, starting with a T cross which is a front raise, extension to the side and lowering the arms down, then you will finish with side lateral raises.

You finish out with one more set of pushups, these really target the triceps as your hands are placed more narrow.  Here you combine a 2-2 and single count for a few sets.  Then you will finish with more ab work, this time reverse crunches later adding some arms that actually help execute the move better, then you will move into double crunches before finishing with a brief set of leg pulleys.  Then it's time to stretch.

This workout packs a lot into 30 minutes, and I really felt liked I worked.  Great for days you don't have a lot of time but want a decent workout.  Sue is the perfect instructor for this video, she is friendly and encouraging but to the point. I liked her.

Overall this is one of the better Crunch sculpting workouts I have tried, I felt it was thorough in hitting all the muscle groups, plus there was a lot of variety.  Recommended.",1144540800,9,3825,4.468975468975469

I plan to try it again with my 8 pound weights and see if that helps, although the 8 pounds may be too heavy for some of the moves (for me anyway).

I have been using it regularly for around 2 years and as a very active person who works out at least once a day, I have to say that this is the best bang for your buck (or for your 35 minutes) out there for several reasons:

1.  The instructor is not annoying

2.  It is a head to toe strength AND cardio workout that will leave you feeling thoroughly worked and energized.

3.  It is motivating and the time seems to speed along so that I never get that ""when is this EVER going to be over"" feeling.

4.  The instructor and backup people are healthy-looking and you can tell they got their great bodies from workouts like the one you're doing (this equals tons of motivation).

5.  You only need hand weights, not balls, mats or steps.

6.  You can stick with the same video for years, and just add weight to keep it challenging.

I could go on and on.  This video has kept me in my size 5's since 2004 and I genuinely enjoy doing it!  At the end of the video Susan says, ""Fitness isn't just a state of body, it's a state of mind"" and then they salute while she says, ""Class desmissed!"" I'm not ashamed to tell you that I'm so amped up by the time I get to this point I salute with a flourish each and every time I finish.  And I always finish!",1140393600,5,1394,4.0625

I rather like the instructor, Susan Hitzmann.  She is encouraging without being annoying.  She also makes it clear how many reps they are going to do so you can keep in time with the video.

Another good thing about this video is that they switch things up every few minutes, so it is a pretty well-rounded workout.

There are several sets of pushups, which I didn't really like, but there is also a lot of weight training. The only thing I had trouble with was all the 'unusual' steps forward and back in the very beginning. For some reason I just couldn't get the hang of it. I would suggest this video for intermediate excercisers, thinking it might be a little strenous for just beginners.",1133481600,2,542,4.376237623762377
1076110,4,6305650691,"In less than 30 minutes, Crunch Boot Camp Training provides a very good full-body strength workout that moves quickly enough to give you some cardio benefit as well (my HRM indicated that I was in my zone for about half of the workout).  It is led by instructor Susan Hitzmann in a ""boot camp"" style, which means you will use weights (Susan recommends between 3 and 10 lbs.) for traditional strength work in addition to non-weighted calisthenics.  The workout is set in the usual Crunch studio with a large class, and one of the background exercisers, Faith, shows low-impact modifications.

The 4-minute warm-up consists of very basic moves such as marches and knee lifts, although Susan adds little twists that makes this segment kind of fun (although I did have a bit of trouble following her movement changes at times).  She then has you pick up your weights to do a squat with a shoulder press, eventually upping the intensity by having you do the press from the squat position.  Next comes an underhand row with a bicep curl, adding in dead lifts at the end.  Then it's to the floor for your first set of push-ups:  full push-ups with your hands propped on your weights (Susan encourages you to complete only as many as you can with good form).  Staying on the floor, you'll do an abs crunch series, and then it's back on your feet for some jumping jacks, adding in a plie squat for more intensity.  Next comes a pulsing lunge that gets REALLY tough when you jump to switch legs.  Remaining standing, Susan goes back to the upper body for a front and wide bicep curl combo; she then does an inner bicep curl with a side plie squat.

Back to the floor--more pushups!  This time, you'll do them from your knees, but they become pretty challenging when Susan adds a plank and a leg lift.  She then does some standing abs work in the form of knee lifts.  Toe raises holding the weights are next, eventually adding in a back lunge, a front extension, and a triceps extension.  She then hones in on the triceps more specifically with kickbacks and an overhead french press.  In the following series, you'll move into a one-legged squat position and do a rear tap, adding in a knee lift.  You'll then perform several cardio moves--a skate slide, a knee hop, and a brief jog--add in some shoulder work (flies, rows, and a T move), and then repeat the rear tap on the other side.  Susan ends with a final set of push-ups--triceps push-ups this time--and some additional abs work in the form of reverse curls.  The 3.5 minute cool-down consists of moving stretches performed entirely on the floor, bringing the entire workout in at just under 30 minutes.

I consider myself to be about an intermediate level exerciser, and I found this workout to be sufficiently challenging, as I was sweaty and breathless by the end.  I started out using 8 lbs. dumbbells, and although I was able to use these for most of the workout, at a few points, I needed to drop down to 5 lbs.  If you are looking for a time-efficient strength routine that will provide an intermediate level workout as well as include some cardio benefits, I would definitely recommend this video.",1129075200,31,3152,4.611111111111111
1076111,5,6305650691,"This is an excellent workout for people of all levels.  The instructor means business, but there are modifiers to help you out if you aren't so fit already.  Even though it's a short workout, they cover everything from abs to butt to arms to shoulders.  There's no messing around.  The only way I wouldn't recommend this is if you want to keep your fitness level up.  Like I said, it's only half an hour and if a lot of that is weights, there isn't nearly enough time to keep your heart rate up.  Use this for those in between days.",1125532800,3,532,4.27

1076114,3,6305650691,"This DVD can definitely be a valuable addition to a fitness DVD library, but with certain caveats.  The DVD works well for me, but it is definitely not for everyone.  In considering whether or not this is a good match for you, I'd make the following recommendations:

* This is not a true ""Boot Camp"" workout - I imagine that our armed forces are doing something quite a bit tougher than this.  If you're already in quite good shape, this workout probably won't provide the challenge level you're looking for after the first few uses.

* The instructor moves VERY quickly, and often jumps right into new moves with no demonstration and only a vague verbal description of what to do.  This presents two problems: first, it's very difficult to keep up until you've done the tape several times and know what's coming next, so patience is definitely required for this one.  Second, some of the moves can potentially lead to knee or back injuries if not performed correctly.  If you're new to free-weight toning work, I would strongly suggest starting with a DVD with a heavy emphasis on proper form (like either of Kathy Smith's Lift Weights to Lose Weight DVDs) to learn how to do the basic moves safely.

* Since this is a ""theme"" workout, the instructor gets a little too into it at times and can get annoying quite quickly.  Unfortunately, because her verbal cues are sometimes all you have to know what to do, you can't mute her.  The workout is worthwhile enough for me to put up with it, but I doubt I'd buy another workout led by her.

* While the DVD does have one person demonstrating modified versions of challenging exercises, she's often not visible due to the camera angles, making this DVD less than ideal for beginners.

This DVD is best suited for intermediate exercisers who already have good fundamentals for toning work (such as proper form for squats and lunges, as well as knowing how to protect your lower back) and can be patient with both the fast pace and the instructor's enthusiasm.  I would not recommend this workout for beginners or anyone with weak knees or a bad back, as some of the exercises may not be safe.",1122595200,10,2139,4.6094986807387865
1076115,5,6305650691,"Before I launch into a diatribe of how much I adore this DVD, I submit this disclaimer (partly as a caveat to the reviews that describe this workout as not being intense enough):  A workout is, in large part, only as intense as you want it to be.  You can half-ass any of the moves on here and end up barely sweating.  If you stay focused on what you're doing, provided you're not super-buff already, then it's definitely a challenging routine.

That said-- I started using this DVD about a year ago, in combination with Crunch's Cardio Sculpt (which is great if you're just starting to work out).  This one is more challenging, so after a few months I switched over to using it almost exclusively.  At only 30 minutes, it's really easy to find the time to do this workout 4-5 times a week, and it shows results within a couple weeks.  It hits all the important spots, and also delivers special attention to the ones that are less obvious to the non-fitness inclined, and which we tend to forget about-- back, obliques, and triceps all get their turn.

Furthermore, Sue (the instructor, with whom I am certainly on a first-name basis after a year of waking up to her shout of, ""OK, troops!"") is so motivated and upbeat that I'm happy to have her in my living room several times a week.  She also has colorful ways of explaining proper form (""Think of ice water on your back-- you're pulling away from it!"") and the uncanny ability to yell out encouragement such as, ""Don't stop now!"", at the crucial moment when you're thinking about doing just that.

The sole negative to this particular DVD:  I agree with some of the other reviewers that the nameless exerciser who stands back right and is wearing khaki shorts is a bit of an enigma.  Why does she keep laughing?  Can't she see that I'm trying to do a bent-over row?  Doesn't she know that physical fitness is NO JOKE?  But really, this isn't such a big deal.  And if we're going to send anyone home from Boot Camp, it had better be the blonde in the front row, who is clearly violating Crunch's committment to a no-pressure workout experience by being too hot.",1121644800,,2114,4.494764397905759
1076116,5,6305650691,"I have to admit, the first time I tried this one out, I didn't like it.  But as in all fitness vids, it takes some time to master the steps and to feel like you own it (isn't that the goal anyway?) I am intermediate at the moment, and it took me a few times through to feel comfortable with the beginning segment - I kept getting the steps wrong, and found myself working the same side of my body twice instead of being able to work with the flow.

HOWEVER, I got it after about 3-4 times, and I LOVE this one. The instructor is excellent - very likeable and complete.  It is only 30 minutes, but after completion I feel like I got a great workout.  I am currently using 5 lb weights, but look to move up. Make sure to invest in a good, slip free (sweat resistnant) mat though, I found out the hard way - you do sweat in this one (especially your hands because of the weights) and it is nearly impossible to do the pushup segments correctly because of it.

Don't get Me wrong, it is a good workout and probably not suitable for beginners but not exactly what I would call boot camp.

1076258,5,6305650691,"""Remember, I would rather you gave me 4 excellent pushups rather than 12 sloppy ones!"" ~Susan L. Hitzmann, M.S, New York Exercise Physiologist

Let's just say that this is one of the most difficult workouts I've ever tried. With that said, it was also an amazing challenge. I actually loved it. My husband even came in to see what on earth I was doing (the words ""TROOPS"" and ""Are you guys ready?"" had his attention). Then, he watched me do pushups. The first time he has seen me actually doing pushups. Normally he walks in when I'm doing yoga, so this was very interesting to him.

Susan L. Hitzmann is the perfect instructor to put you in the mood to really push yourself towards a higher level of fitness. She uses amusing army-themed phrases and encourages her ""troop"" to really get moving. Everyone in this workout group looks ""pumped"" and they all look like they definitely use heavier weights. The muscle definition is impressive and you will hear words like ""dead lift"" and ""no break"" which gives you an idea of the style and focus. You can definitely use heavier weights because you are not bouncing around while holding the weights. You alternate between high-intensity cardio and intense weight lifting.

You don't have to use heavier weights. I used 3lb and 5lb weights/dumbbells. They recommend 3-10 pound weights. I noticed this is an intense upper body workout. You will also notice all-over body conditioning and it is definitely a workout you will want to do again and again. You will feel the results, especially in your stomach and arms.

The pushups are fun and there are different varieties. Then, there are the situps. I could hardly do a pushup or situp for three days after attempting this workout. I mean, you really feel this workout in the days that follow. So, you might want to do stretching or yoga for a few days after this workout.

Crunch Boot Camp will keep you energized and highly motivated. It just takes hold of your mind and you can't help but do everything Susan commands. She is an excellent instructor/drill sergeant and she makes you smile while you are working out like you have never worked out before.

This was the most intense 35 minutes of exercise I've ever tried. It was also very amusing and I loved the entertaining theme. Even watching it again while reviewing it, I want to just go do the workout. The music alone makes you want to move. There are a few sections  that also require excellent coordination and I'm still working on the fancy footwork at the start. I've learned that if you just keep moving, you can work through any fancy footwork. Fortunately, it is minimal in this workout.

Highly Recommended for Intermediate to Advanced. If you want a challenge, this will push you to your limits and you will actually love it. Lots of humor and definately a 10 star workout!

1076365,5,6305650691,This video worked out well for me.  It mixed different types of exercises so that I did not really get so bored.  The woman who is the trainer on this video is not fake or overly sugary like Denise Austin is.  Her comments generaly revolve around the exercises with a few dumb little side comments.  I have not however seen such an odd assortment of people working out together in my life.  Their background chatter does get a little tiresome but is not overwhelming.  I am glad that I bought this video and would say that I am loosing some weight.,1053648000,2,548,4.376237623762377
1076485,5,6305650691,"I love, love, love this video!  Because it is a multi muscle workout you raise your heart rate while toning!  I am a working Mom of 4 and I need for my time investment to pay off!  This packs a punch for a 30 minute workout!  I'm uncoordinated so I don't like a lot of dance/aerobic tapes.  After the second try I had the moves mastered!  (no easy feat for a someone with two left feet!) You can raise the intensity by increasing the size of your hand weights!  When I complete this boot camp video, I am really sweating and all my muscles feel awakened!  This is my new favorite home workout!  There is an instructor who demonstrates a low impact version of the workout and she is visible to offer the low impact version of instructor Susan Hintzeman's high impact version!",1052438400,33,774,4.356643356643357
1076486,5,6305650691,"As a mother of a 3 year old, I found little time to get in an effective workout most days...until I bought this tape!  I find that this Boot Camp is not only a great workout, but fun also.  The seven minute segments make the 30 minutes go by quickly without wondering 'when is this gonna end!'.  I also love the weights that they include, and they are at an intensity level where you can add more or less depending on your strength level.  Post-pregnancy, I regained muscle tone quickly by using this video that only took up 30 minutes of my time.  (Any of you other moms will probably agree that very seldom do we get more than 30 minutes before something else interrupts).  I find this is the workout I want multiple times per week for a quick, effective, and fun workout.",1043971200,19,774,4.340277777777778
1076487,4,6305650691,"Crunch's ""Boot Camp"" workout may seem a bit...OK, campy...but it is surprisingly challenging.  The video is focused on the concept of interval training.  As the Amazon.com editor has pointed out, each segment is about 7 minutes and each alternates between strength training and cardio.
The strength segments are good, with a lot of GREAT arm work using dumb bells (sorry, you have to provide these yourself).  The only leg work involves lunges and squats, which may not be your cup of tea if you had bad knees.  The abdominal exercises are good, but people with decently strong abs may find that there aren't enough reps to get a really good burn.
The cardio segments, at 7 minutes a piece, are for certain brief.  However, they are a lot of fun and good breaks between strength training intervals.
I immediately noticed what one Amazon.com reviewer did; your ""classmates"" in the video are so smily you wonder if their plastic surgeons made a mistake.  But, the instructor is just enthusiastic enough to keep you going and just non-perky enough that you don't feel like throwing your dumb bell at the tv.
In a total time of 30 minutes, you get a decent workout and have some fun.  And for you people looking for an upper body/arm workout....you will REALLY enjoy Boot Camp!",1043280000,19,1273,4.759090909090909
1076488,5,6305650691,"This video gives a great whole body workout in a short time.  The instructor explains sequences so that they can be easily followed even the first time.  She does say some annoying things though like `each time you come back I want you to pick up heavier hand weights' really we're going to have 50 lbs weights soon.  The exercises aren't too easy or too difficult, and there are also alternate exercises (some of the time) if you want to take it down a little or are just beginning.  I like the whole body aspect of this workout.  There are cardio sections, but there are also calisthenics that work most other major muscle groups including arm and leg exercises using hand weights (and many varieties of push-ups), several types of ab exercises, and funky pushups that include back leg lifts to work the glutes.  I don't like the active stretching (stretching in which you are always moving and not holding a stretch for any period of time) that is used for the cool down, so I often skip that.  I usually like to do more (longer duration of) cardio than this video provides, but if I'm short on time or just too tired to do more, this tape gives a great complete workout in only 30 min.",1041638400,3,1189,4.451612903225806

It is so short that I can fit it in before or after dinner, but the intensity makes you feel like you've worked out for much longer.  The instructor is fun and makes me feel motivated to keep using the video.  I've been using it for over a year at least twice a week and it never gets boring and I've lost weight and kept it off.

1076585,4,6305650691,"The only negative thing I have to say about this video is the whole ""Boot Camp"" sounding off attitude that the instructor does. But it's minor compared to the seriously tough workout that you get in the end.  From the moment, this tape starts, you don't stop.  She takes you from strength work to cardio to balance segments to push-ups (then MORE push-ups later on!) and back again. I would definitely recommend this for time-pressed individuals that don't have an hour to workout. In 30 minutes, you are definitely sweating and the Bonus is that you're done in that amount of time.",1021680000,5,582,4.696078431372549

It includes all the inportant lower body exercises that really work- like lunges, squats. It has a lot of upper body workouts with weights, and some of the upper body work is done while doing lower body. This is a really efficient workout for only 30 minutes.

It's nice to have a 30 minute workout on hand, though, for those times when time is short.  The girl who keeps making ""growling"" type faces is a bit over the top.
Basically, though, a great workout wher you will work up a sweat every time, and feel it the next day.  Definitely NOT for beginners.",1004140800,4,423,4.0602409638554215

Susan Hitzmann is very engaging.  She is extremely motivating, energetic and friendly.  Her cuing is impeccable.  She is extremely good at providing instruction on proper technique during all demonstrations.

I come back to this tape time and time again, especially on days when my time is limited. The moves are intense, but varied, so I am never bored, and just when I think I'm going to die from the push-ups, it's on to something else.
I am a regular exerciser (mostly cardio--aerobics, running), and wanted a tape that would give me strength work, but not take up my whole evening.  This tape fits the bill, and exceeded my expectations.  The moves are always challenging, and the instructor is great.  She explains the moves very well and has a no-nonsense non-cutesy approach that is refreshing.  I've seen a difference in my arms and butt especially (love those squats!), and have noticed more stamina when I run.
