2488148,5,B000E3LIO0,"Mara Corday is 110 in the shade.  She was the October 1958 Playmate in Playboy.

A solid science fiction ""Bug"" movie. Almost as good as ""Them!""

I completely understand that obscure movies like this may not economically justify pressing a disc.  However, I would have gladly paid a dollar or two more for a disc that would last forever.  Instead, they burned the movie on the old-fashioned, purple dye type disc that are only good for around 5 - 7 years. M-Disc last 100s of years.

This review is for the actual item I received from Amazon. If you are after a, ""pure movie review"", I suggest you look at the International Movie Database. There you will find many reviews without regard to the delivery mechanism.

The Video and audio quality are excellent.

Great Movie !!",1514332800,,773,4.632352941176471
2488149,4,B000E3LIO0,"One of the better giant bug movies of the 1950s. Very good quality video and audio (it includes an English soundtrack). This is the first time I have seen this film in its widescreen format, a great improvement over the 4:3 dvd. I had no problems playing this disc on a new Oppo and a 3 yr.-old Panasonic bluray player, neither of which are region free. It also played fine on a PS3. I don't know why Universal hasn't released this on bluray in the US, but you can't go wrong with this Italian version. This film ranks only behind THEM in the giant radioactive insect category (yes I know a spider isn't an insect, but who cares). If you're a fan of 1950s horror movies, I also recommend you check out the Spanish bluray of NIGHT OF THE DEMON. It's Region A, B, and C and available from Amazon. Like TARANTULA, it's a big improvement over the dvd, includes an English soundtrack, and like TARANTULA had no problems playing it on any of my bluray players.",1514246400,,954,4.395480225988701

2488168,5,B000E3LIO0,"Leo G. Carroll, ""The Parent Trap"" (1961), is the Professor. He was working with a formula that made things grow, really grow. He is the good guy and trying to find an answer to world hunger. There is a difference of opinion and the scuffle starts a fire. The professor gets injected and the tarantula escapes.

John Agar, ""The Brain from Planet Arouse"" (1957), gets to be Doctor Matt Hastings the good guy.

Clint Eastwood ""Dirty Harry"" (1971), is a fighter pilot and gets to bomb the tarantula.

I saw this at the movies when I was a kid. The creature had habit of leaving white stuff everywhere it did it's thing. The film broke for a commercial at that time and was advertising tooth powder. ""Powder your teeth. Don't past them."" Needles to say I cringe at the site of white tooth powder to this day.

So an alternate title for this movie could be ""daddy-longlegs""",1501027200,,867,4.503184713375796

2488203,4,B000E3LIO0,"I grew up watching these giant bug movies whil in
..e I was a boy, and I have a soft spot in my heart (and maybe my head) for them. TARANTULA is one of the better ones. Not as good as THEM but pretty well done as directed by Jack Arnold. The hero is played by handsome John Agar, a fixture in these early sci-fi flicks, and the heroine is played by the lovely Mara Corday. Added credibility is given by the presence of veteran Hitchcock actor, Leo G. Carrol as the mad scientist. at the time, Carroll was starring on TV as TOPPER, and when he first appeared on screen, all the kids screamed ""Cosmo TOPPER!"".  An experiment to provide a new animal feed creates giant animals and, one day, a Tarantula escapes into the desert and continues to grow. The SFX are all back projection and process shots, but they worked well, back in the day. I don't really think you need to spend extra money for the Blu Ray version, though. Look around for the regular DVD release. Old movies like this can only be improved just so much. After that, it becomes pointless.",1453507200,,1051,4.33502538071066

2488213,4,B000E3LIO0,"I think this is from 1956 or so. So let's get to it, the effects were what they were at the time. Don't expect CGI or anything so grand. They took film of a tarantula and pasted it on the screen. Okay, now that is out of the way. Fun, fun, fun. Leo G. Carroll is the mad scientist experimenting with growth hormones (early steroids?) on animals and bugs and his assistant, yuck! His deformed assistant tries to kill him and sets fire to the lab, allowing the still kind of small tarantula to escape...it grows up a lot. His new assistant the lovely Mara Corday and her new beau local doctor John Agar try to combat the big bad bug. Very fun and so entertaining. We must save the town.",1445385600,,684,4.229007633587786
2488214,4,B000E3LIO0,good for  old  movie  buffs,1445040000,,27,4.0
2488215,5,B000E3LIO0,"I first caught this movie one night back in the 1980s on a local channel at about 3:00am, and I loved it immediately, as I do many 1950s sci-fi/horror flicks. This one creeped me out too. I came upon this DVD and bought it on the spot. I wanted to see it again and see if it still holds up for me. It does, and I still love it. The mood and vibe of the film is still creepy, and the 1950s special effects, primitive as they are, work very well and also still hold up. Directed by Jack Arnold, this is no surprise. The scenes with the giant tarantula suddenly walking into the frame, or suddenly popping up and crawling over the top of a mountain while eyeing new human prey as it starts down the other side, are still creepy and menacing. This is a great little flick, right up there with Arnold's other great films of the genre, as well as the works of others in the genre such as ""THEM!"", ""The Fly"" and ""The Thing From Another World"" etc. The cast is excellent, with both fine established character actors, as well as at least one up and coming actor in a small role here who would go on to become an American icon. This would be Clint Eastwood, who makes his appearance near the end of the film as he prepares for his later ""Dirty Harry"" character by getting dirty with a 100 foot spider who is anything but a ""punk."" Sorry, I couldn't resist.

The leading man here is John Agar who is quite good in the role as the comforting small town doctor who helps figure the mystery out, and as a little piece of trivia, the leading lady here is the gorgeous Mara Corday, who would many years later meet up with Mr. Eastwood face to face as ""Loretta"" in the coffee shop robbery scene of the Dirty Harry film ""Sudden Impact."" The film print and transfer here are excellent. It is sharp, clear, and any sort of imperfections, especially for a film of this vintage, are not even worth mentioning. It appears to have been taken straight from the original 1955 negative, and it looks pretty fantastic. You likely won't see the film looking any better than it does here. Not enough to matter. The audio is 2.0 Dolby Digital Mono, and it's clean. clear and fine. This all said, this DVD is about as bare bones as it gets. It consists of the film, and nothing else - and I mean ""nothing"" else. There isn't even a menu. As soon as you pop it into your player, the movie begins. I guess that's the point of these Universal ""Vault Series"" releases. Vintage and hard to find '50s sci-fi classics that would otherwise likely never see the light of day on DVD. A few little extra tidbits would've been cool, but I feel lucky just to have a nice DVD copy of this vintage sci-fi classic. If you like the movie and simply want to see it and own a copy, you can't go wrong here.",1444348800,,2754,4.255725190839694
2488216,5,B000E3LIO0,Great ~ thank you!  Very excited to watch this after so many years since I first viewed it!,1442534400,,91,4.055555555555555
2488217,4,B000E3LIO0,"Bring on the giant insects!  I think the reason there are giant animals in this movie is because the scientists were working on a way to get more food for the planet and causing rapid growth in animals was the way to do it. Commendable, but why would they inject themselves with the serum? That's never explained, except it's a plot device for the first scene and what to come.  Of course, the injectee goes berserk and lets loose the animals and one of them...a...you guessed it!...tarantula, escaped to the desert where it begins to lunch on ranchers, sheep, and whatever other life is around.

There are the usual stock characters...the young doctor, scientist, whatever occupation the hero has, the plucky girl with the boy's name, in this case, I think it was Stevie, the older scientist who's behind it all but didn't mean any harm and eventually pays for it, and the secondary, disbelieving characters who are convince pretty quick.  Yes, there's a brief glimpse of Clint Eastwood as a fighter pilot.  This is the film that put the word ""napalm"" into my vocabulary.

Hokey?  Now, it is. Back then, it was dreadful, atomic-age scary. It's still good for a late Saturday night with popcorn and a couple of friends to enjoy it with.

This movie was viewed in a theater  and more recently on television by the reviewer and no remuneration was involved n the writing of this review.",1441238400,,1384,4.70954356846473

Carroll (SUSPICION, SPELLBOUND, STRANGERS ON A TRAIN, NORTH BY NORTHWEST) as the scientist who inadvertently unleashes the titanic arachnid!

It's a classic 50's Sci Fi flick with a charm much like the original ""THING"" due to the wonderful cast of character actors making up Desert Rocks citizenry.  But based on some of the comments made about the Vault Series picture/ sound quality, I had been reluctant to buy the CD. Well, I took a chance on it and I'm happy with the result. I doubt that it was re-mastered but it's a fine print nonetheless. Overall quality of the CD is excellent to fine.... Best I've seen this old favorite since its big screen debut. P.S.

2488292,3,B000E3LIO0,"as probably most people looking for this movie now I saw the TARANTULA
way back in the 1960's
I think even then it was a rerelease
being shown on my
public television network
on a weekly
Friday or Saturday night show called watch the sky
awesome old sci-films were shown on those nights
anyway the narrator of the show usually had some
unusual and fascinating fact aboutsome/ one/some/part of the movie
the fascinating fact for this particular movie was:
for all you STAR TREK FAND OUT THERE
STAR TREK  had just finished I think it's three run on the network and and most all the sci-fi nerds
could easily recognize Leonard Nimoy's voice
so the narrator said listen closely sci-fi fansto the pilots voice
at the end of this movie the big bad TARANTULA was of course out in the desert
close to EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE so a big bad fast mover F-4phantom was
dispatched to waste the TARANTULA before it made it's way into some low-rent out of the pop:142
town
so when I bough this movie to add to my vast collection
made up a batch of popcorn fired up the woodstove tonight it was -26degrees below zerow
where I live in the good old U.S.A.
loved the movie until the very end no missl;es blasting the TARANTULA and no mr. spocks
voice saying other than those two disappoints at the end of th movie
I still gave it an OK RATING nothing better than a 100foot tall arachnid

2488321,5,B000E3LIO0,"This review is actually just about the Universal Vault presentation (since if you're reading this, you already know the popularity and cultural status of this movie).

Purchased my DVD-R Mar 2013

Format: Originally filmed on 35mm (Spherical process) and softmatted to 1.85:1 for presentation, this presentation shows you more than the director intended by ""opening up the matte"" to a 1.33:1 presentation.  So, while you are getting all the movie, you're also getting what the director didn't intend to be on screen (to a degree).  -.25 in quality

PQ: Astounding for print of its agent and not re-mastered.  If the very finest DVDs reach a scale of 4/5 (Bluray being 5/5), this disc would rate 3.60/4 - only marred by specs and flecks and grain a little ""too"" apparent at times for my taste. Definitely high quality that no one would complain about.

AQ: Originally a Mono (Western Electric Recording) , this presentation is DD 2.0 (Dolby Stereo)w avg 192kbps. No annoying hiss, or tin can sound either. Very fine.

This Region 1 (only) DVD-R is recorded with avg Bit Rate of 7.80 Mbps at 480i  29.97 fps so  best presentation will be with a DVD player that upscales (or at least de-interlaces). 8 Chapters stops on the disc (though NO splash / title menu / chapter titles, or special features).

You can't go wrong with this purchase of this classic monster flick.  The only thing better would be a blu-ray with special features.",1362700800,,1431,4.819672131147541

2488326,5,B000E3LIO0,"This is another favorite of mine in the GIANT insects running amuck genre.  As far as I'm concerned, there aren't nearly enough GIANT insect movies to satisfy me.  Be that as it may, this is one of the lesser efforts in that genre because the tarantula actually takes second billing to a crazy professor.  As far as screen time goes, the tarantula is a guest star in its own movie.  Most of the story involves a crazy professor (Leo G. Carroll) who uses the excuse of an impending food shortage to experiment on animals.  Naturally, his experiments get the better of him.  This movie also stars John Agar as the town doctor; he spends an inordinate amount of time smiling at the oddest moments.............when not leering at costar Mara Corday (the aforementioned crazy professor's new assistant).  As for the tarantula, once in a while it wanders by before throwing caution to the wind, allowing itself to be seen by one and all.  A rampage ensues, easily the best part of this movie.  Nothing says PEEK-A-BOO like a giant tarantula peering in your bedroom window!  This film works best as a double feature with something like The Deadly Mantis (also a favorite of mine).",1359072000,,1173,4.733990147783251
2488327,5,B000E3LIO0,"I turned this movie on almost half way through and couldn't stop watching it to the conclusion. The way the tarantula was shown crawling over the desert is just priceless, rather graceful and precise, occasionally knocking into power lines and causing outages but not getting hurt. Don't know why these scenes please me so but they do. Maybe because it was better done than any number of dinosaur movies I saw as a child. Maybe it goes to show the fear of giant monsters in 50's movies is either ingrained in people who lived then or can be acquired in an instant by anyone from any culture. The cinematography of the desert landscape, small towns, lab/house, other animals and vehicles was very good. Loved the scientist's convertible ('55 Ford Fairlane?)and how it overpowered the empty desert landscape as the tarantula did. On an analytical note, maybe the massive power line towers were also seen as a fearsome thing and seeing them bumped by a monster was almost a good thing. I was sad when the tarantula met his end, again, don't know why. I'm not a big fan of monster films but this is now my favorite movie monster of all time.",1357344000,,1137,4.633663366336633

2488337,3,B000E3LIO0,"I have been a fan of Universal Studios 1955 sci-fi classic ""Tarantula"" since I first saw it as a kid on a Louisville-based weekly Creature Feature show called ""Memories of Monsters"" back in the mid-1980's. I recorded it on VHS and watched it countless times throughout the rest of the 1980's until the tape was eventually lost during a move. I didn't rediscover the film until recently when I watched it on Turner Classic Movies. I was surprised to find out that I liked the movie as much now as I did then.

Much like many of the ""giant bug"" films of the 1950's, ""Tarantula"" uses nuclear testing, and/or bio-engineering-gone-wrong as a plot device. It is the best of the giant bug films of its era in my opinion and stands the test of time, unlike alot of its constituants.

The DVD, however, is awful. The transfer is terrible and the sound is abysmal. I am hoping that at some point Universal gives this film the type of DVD release it deserves. This particular DVD release will have to do for the time being.",1335225600,,1012,4.494565217391305

2488354,3,B000E3LIO0,"Tarantula is another of these '50s sci-fi B movies from the specialist Jack Arnold, where you have to look beyond what you're seeing to get the point.

In dealing with issues of world hunger from over-population and the concerns of some people about genetically modified food, the film is surprisingly contemporary.
The mild mannered and well meaning Professor Deemer (Leo G. Carroll) and his colleagues mix their new formula with a radioactive isotope to increase domestic farm animals to gargantuan size. Deemer fears future generations are at risk of food shortages...he quaintly predicts that the planet will have an over-population 3.75 billion people by the year 2000!

To demonstrate the popular 1950s fear of disaster possible from unfetted science, Deemer's colleagues in pre-narrative  inject themselves with the formula. The drug unexpectedly drives them mad and mutates their own bodies (radiation mutation is another 1950s fear) before finally killing them. A subordinate likewise condemns Professor Deemer to death and mutation by injecting him with the formula as they scuffle among caged test animals in Deemer's laboratory. To literally illustrate 1950s fear of experiments escaping containment and wreaking havoc, one experiment, an oversized tarantula, walks to freedom out a broken door as the laboratory is destroyed by the fire.

As with most B 1950s sci-fi movies the standard of acting and character development is subordinate to the plot, so it would be unfair to comment on the acting of John Agar and Mara Corday.
There is no point either, in mentioning that the spider ultimate height of 100' utterly defies the square/cube principle.

The spider meets its doom at the hands of an very young actor who went on to huge TV and movie stardom...but to say any more would create an unforgivable spoiler.

Tarantula is a B movie,after all, where suspension of disbelief is at its greatest, and  intended as prelude to the A movie the audience actually came to see.
Jack Arnold's thrust about nuclear radiation and scientists loosing control of the experiments and putting humanity at risk is purely allegorical. Trantula works at the level of showing popular concerns on the day and as an example of B-moviemaking.",1297382400,,2236,5.211699164345404

2488356,3,B000E3LIO0,"Although there were notable exceptions, in the 1950s most horror films were little more than drive-in dreck--and then, in 1955, came THEM! The movie had a new story line: atomic testing had mutated insects that grew to enormous size and threatened the existence of human race.  It also had a good script, good cast, good special effects, and exceptional atmosphere.  When it became a big hit everyone rushed to cash in, and TARANTULA! was among the first mimics.

TARANTULA! isn't in the same class as THEM! but it is several steps ahead of most ""big bug"" movies.  Professor Deemer (Leo G. Carroll) is working with atomically bonded nutrients that have the effect of making animals grow much larger than normal.  Among his subjects is a tarantula, and when his assistant wrecks the lab the creature escapes into the countryside, where it continues to grow while munching on cattle and the occasional human.  Soon local doctor Matt Hastings (John Agar) and Deemer's newest lab worker Stephanie Clayton (Mara Corday)--not to mention the entire population of their small town--are on the run.

The film's special effects mixed tarantula models, shots of a live tarantula on minature sets, and lots of rear projection, and while it wasn't quite as ""state of the art"" as some would have you believe, it was still pretty up-scale.  Unfortunately, the script and performances are ho-hum and the pace seems rather slow.  Fans of 1950s ""B"" horror will find it entertaining, and it might do as popcorn-thrower for a family night, but beyond that TARANTULA! doesn't deserve the exclamation point.

Except for a talky middle section of this film, it entertained. (The beginning and ending segments were the best!). It also was fun for me to see Leo G. Carroll, a guy I saw each week growing up watching ""Topper"" on television. Carroll played, by far, the most interesting character in this movie.

The acting was good in here, too, once again above '50s sci-fi standards. It was one of the better entries in the recently-released Sci-Fi Ultimate DVD set. A pretty good transfer, too.  It can also be seen here on this Region 2 DVD.",1241395200,,757,4.634328358208955

There were a number of science-fiction films.  One of these was Tarantula.

This film has an assortment of fine characters with a good script and decent special effects for the time period.

Once again the viewer is given a glimpse into the mysterious world of the atom, especially the radiation component which has tragic consequences for the human race.

A group of scientists from Oak Ridge relocate to a quiet, desert town of Desert Rock, Arizona.  Outside of the city limits, they conduct their secret experiments on a non organic nutrient food concentrate.  Their goal is lofty-to alleviate world hunger as the population increases beyond the earth's abilities to provide food.

There is a tragic accident, and an injected tarantula escapes from the lab.  The nutrient accelerates the growth rate at an astronomical rate.  The spider becomes the menace, but the real villains are the scientists who created it by altering nature's laws.

Leo G. Caroll was the dedicated Gerald Deemer from Oak Ridge who led the team.  His soft spoken manner gave his character a sympathetic allure, rationality, sanity, and humanity.

John Agar's portrayal of Matt Hastings, the country doctor who attempts to solve the mystery of a man's strange death, is played with deftness. His gentle nature and calmness are attributes of a small town healer and comforter.

Stephanie ""Steve"" Clayton, the graduate biology student, is both beautiful and intelligent.  She can also cook, clean and wash- the ideal woman of the 50's.

There is a nice chemistry between her and Hastings.  A little romantic tension goes a long way in this film.

Hank Patterson's Josh is a delight.  He's the comic relief.  He has some of the best scenes and lines.

Some of the dialogue is priceless- ""Jumping Jupiter""; ""Holy Cow""; etc.  You don't find this five and dime dialogue in today's film market.

The cameo of Clint Eastwood as a fighter pilot is a good piece of cinema history.  The oxygen mask may have covered his face, but those eyes of his acted brilliantly.

Also, it was an unaccredited, young composer named Henry Mancini who did the music. He was under contract to Universal Pictures Music Department.

The climatic ending is a fine moment caught in time.  When you view this film and especially its ending, image yourself in the audience of 1955.  The ending takes on a whole new meaning when viewed from that 1955 perspective.

For this 1950's science fiction genre, this is one of the well written and acted films which tapped into the fears of society about the atom and its deadly components.  Ordinary people facing extraordinary menaces, is life at its most challenging moments.",1230076800,,2934,4.914460285132383

This film had a low-budget. The big house in the desert does not seem authentic for that dry rustic setting. The special effects were great for that time. Note the message of this movie: only the Federal government can save you from alien threats. In an earlier time the unity of the people would have ended the threat.

Watching it was like spending time with an old childhood friend.  Considering it was 1955, the effects in this movie are pretty frightening, especially when viewing the entire real tarantula that was superimposed.  The closeups are cheesy, but we didn't have CGI then.  John Agar, Leo G. Carroll (who would go on to be the boss for the man from UNCLE), Mara Corday (Black Scorpion), Nestor Paiva, Hank Patterson (Green Acres), and yes, even Clint Eastwood are around to flesh out the characters.

It's a very re-watchable film, with some pretty good acting and well-drawn characters. Plus a plot that's not totally off-the-wall. Well, yeah, it's out in left field (somewhat), but not so much as to be considered completely ludicrous in every sense.
Leo G. Carroll does a fine job as the bio-chemist whose experiments with a new ""growth formula"" on animals (including our menacing friend, Mister ""Tarantula"") go terribly wrong when the multi-legged beast escapes Carroll's laboratory.
I truly enjoy watching this movie -- no matter how many screenings I give it.  The atmosphere, characters, and storyline have me ""locked in"" from the very start.
And the special effects don't look too bad either -- considering it's from 1955 and well before ""CGI"" type beasts & explosions.
I even kind of like the rather corny (and, I assume, not realistic) ""hissing""/""rattling"" noises that emanate from the super-sized spider during the film. LOL!
Also on the humorous side of things -- I've always thought it was mighty cooperative of our giant-sized, venom-spewing beast to ""follow the road into town"" at the end of the film, thereby making the townspeople's job of setting up the dynamite a great deal easier. (Since when do spiders follow the 'rules of the road'? Oh, well, I guess we'll just assume that our Tarantula here owns a '55 Chevy, and is familiar with the desert highways that surround him. LOL!)
This whole movie is great fun from start to finish.  Plus -- There's a fun ""Theatrical Trailer"" for the film included on this VHS version.

If you're into cheesy yet fun 50s sci-fi thrillers, this is one movie to add to your collection.  Capitalizing on the popularity of Them released a year earlier, it is a tarantula this time that is exposed to radioactive material that somehow causes the spider to grow to gargantuan proportions.  Like many vintage sci-fi movies, viewers need to suspend their disbelief to enjoy the film but this one in particular makes it quite a challenge.
Leo G. Carrol plays distinguished biochemist Professor Deamer who lives like a hermit in a remote area outside a small Arizona town developing a synthetic nutrient out of a radioactive isotope.  While giving a brief tour of his home laboratory facilities to the town doctor Dr. Hastings (John Agar) and his newly arrived graduate assistant Stephanie (Steve) Clayton (Mara Corday), Deamer proudly touts this radioactive swill as the answer to world hunger.  Indeed, his laboratory animals from rabbits to monkeys exhibit fast growth rates in his experiments.  Theres just one problem.  The isotope is unstable and unpredictable causing death in some animals.  As Steve confides to Dr. Hastings, they must solve this problem before they can ever experiment on a human.  (Duh! And to say nothing of the ethical issues this would raise.)  This of course, doesnt dissuade his previous assistants who were impatient enough to try the formula for themselves. (Damn the rats and monkeys! Its got to work.) They subsequently contract a rare degenerative disease that disfigures their faces and bodies.  Despondent and angry, one of the hideous assistants survives long enough to attack Deamer in his laboratory and forcibly give him an injection as well.  The ensuing scuffle causes a fire and damage to the facility enabling an abnormally large tarantula among the specimens to escape into the desert and wreak havoc throughout the county.
Finally, the plausibility of the films premise is further belied by the fact that a tarantulas body structure couldn't possibly support its own weight at such a size.  Volume is cubed so the weight increases at a rate much faster than the size.
Scientific inaccuracies aside, the scenes of the tarantula legs poking out and climbing over distant hillsides are unforgettable as are the accompanying musical scores.  This is certainly an entertaining and fun film even if only for laughs at times.",1012003200,,2587,5.056470588235294

I was close to three when I saw it at the show in 1957.  The part that stuck with me all through the years was the night scene in which the tarantula creeps down a hillside toward horrified horses (I felt so sorry for them!), and when it's eye fills the window of a two-story building!  The tarantula is a very well-made film considering the budget that was alloted for it.  Directors of 50s science fiction films often recieved major budget cuts to their films when studio heads wanted to save money!  For instance, ""Them"" 1954, would have been filmed in color but a huge budget cut only alloted for black and white shooting.  Also, directors were given a certain amount of time to get their film completed, so working conditions were often hectic and frantic!
Nevertheless, I think that this is a great sci-fi film and seeing it as a wee tot in 1957 allows me to view it with that special child like sense of wonder...and yes I still worry about the horses!",1008892800,,1122,4.355769230769231

Also, once he finds out there's a giant spider around, he flies to some professors 200 miles away without telling anyone in the town. I know no one would have believed him, but that brings us to the biggest plot hole of all. Are we really suppossed to believe that absolutely no one has seen this thing walking around?

2488383,4,B000E3LIO0,"Outstanding 1950's science fiction thriller by noted fantasy director Jack Arnold (The Incredible Shrinking Man, The Creature from the Black Lagoon) sees an arachnid grow to mammoth proportions and terrorise a small desert community !!
Professor Deemer (Leo G. Carroll)is working in desert laboratory on a radiation developed serum to rapidly accelerate growth and size of animals with a view to solve world's food crisis. After Deemer is involved in laboratory destroying fight with a fellow scientist afflicted by growth serum side effects, an oversized arachnid escapes into the New Mexico desert and proceeds to grow and develop a hunger for livestock & humans !
""Tarantula"" also features square jawed, John Agar as town doctor Matt Hastings...and the very attractive Mara Corday as medical researcher ""Steve"" Clayton. The film has a wonderful eerie quality that existed throughout Jack Arnolds sci-fi films and the ominous soundtrack accompanying the arachnid is excellent. The interesting black and white photography in the stark desert locations further adds to the unsettling nature that something hideous is lurking nearby....
And yes...that's Clint Eastwood almost hidden behind the oxygen mask aboard the jet fighter in the film's final sequences.
A ""B"" horror movie that hits it's mark on every point....highly recommended for fans of the genre !",974937600,,1358,5.4714285714285715
2488384,4,B000E3LIO0,"This is a classic 50's giant creepy crawly film, but with a good plot, and fab special effects.
The really good thing about this film, though, was the spider.  He starts off fairly small, but just keeps on growing, slowly but surely, eating bigger and bigger prey as he grows.  He didn't just expand miraculously before your eyes, he grew in a normal way, just faster and bigger.  Eventually he gets big, really big!  Not merely as big as a dog, or an elephant, but as big as a mountain!
As often happens in sci-fi, you learn something while being scared.  In this case, you learn (if its really true, of course!) that spiders can walk up walls because they produce a kind of sticky goo at the end of their legs, and leave little ""footprints"" of this stuff behind.  Our colossal eight legger, being colossal, leaves footprints a couple of feet across, with a thick layer of this goo in each one.  Naturally enough, some poor eejit is wandring around the desert, oblivious to the fact that there's one hell of a big spider thudding aroung the place, spots a footprint, and bends down to have a look.  ""hmmm...what's this stuff?"" says Mr spider food, rubbing the goo between his fingers.  I'm sure you can guess what happens next.  Crunchy and messy.  Yum!
In the end, the jets get him, but it was enjoyable while it lasted.  I saw this film on TV when I was small and it frightened the shamrocks out of me!  I remember watching it from behind the couch, and apparently going all pale and nearly fainting at one stage!  If you want, you could see it as a warning of the unforseen consequences of scientific interference with the environment - maybe the film makers could see ahead to genetic engineering, global warming and ozone depletion!  But really, it's just a fab film, good for scaring little boys.
If you're doing some babysitting and you want the little darlings to be scared into silence so you can get on with eating the pizza in peace, this is the one.",970444800,,1962,4.502824858757062
2488385,4,B000E3LIO0,"It's big, hairy, ugly, and it has eight legs.  A dedicated, if slightly mad, scientist (Leo G. Carroll) experiments with ""gigantism"" in  animals as a solution to the world's finite food supply.  One of the  ""experiments,"" a tarantula the size of a large dog, escapes  during a fire in the lab, and crawls out into the desert.  Because its  enhanced size is chemically induced, the spider continues to grow, and  grow.  This is an entertaining '50's scif-fi flick that does a nice job of  building suspense.  There are a couple of ""cheap shots"" of a  person coming up off camera, and suddenly touching someone on the shoulder.  The first-time viewer is expected to jump out of his skin, I guess. A  better example of the film's scary content is the night scene showing  nervous horses pacing in their corral while frantically looking at the  nearby hill and sensing ""something"" approaching over the horizon.  When the ""something"" finally arrives, pandemonium ensues.  Another scene showing the skeletal remains of cattle amid ""pools""  of spider venom raises the hackles.  In typical '50s fashion, conventional  handguns, shotguns, and rifles can't stop the big bug.  The Big T just  keeps coming.  The special effects are competent, if not spectacular.  The  B&W photography combined with a normal sized tarantula photographically  enlarged to fantastic proportions produces some dark-tinted results that  adds to the creature's aura of shadowy mystery, especially in the frequent  night scenes.  Considering the gigantic size of the thing, it takes the  townspeople forever to realize there is something awry out there in the  spooky desert.  After the truth is learned, the usual ""monster  movie"" hysteria breaks loose.  As the Big T approaches the little  town, no doubt planning to feast on the local population, fighter jets are  seen above, and there is the smell of napalm in the morning.
As  classic sci-fi/monster movies go, this film is on many viewers' short list  of the best ""creepy-crawlies.""  It's in the same class as the  perennial favorite, ""Them.""  Monster movie aficionados certainly  need this film as part of their personal movie collection.  It's also a  good introduction to classic sci-fi for the younger generation.  Make the  popcorn, and gather around the TV for the fun.  ;-)",967161600,,2303,5.097297297297297
2488386,4,B000E3LIO0,"As fan of many films, including B rated horror, Tarantula has always been up there in my top five favorites. John Agar, who seemed to be the sci-fi  thrillers leading man in the 50's, is absolutely priceless with his cocky  and corny attitude we've all come to know and love. The special effects in  this movie were great, considering when it was made. Having it filmed in  the desert gave it another eerie quality in itself. I would recommend  watching this film on a lazy afternoon with a bowl of popcorn and prepare  to be entertained!",966643200,,538,4.552083333333333
2488387,5,B000E3LIO0,"Is it Oscarworthy?  God, no.  Is the plot remotely memorable?  Ummm....plot?  Does John Agar go totally over the top and give a completely hammy performance like he does in every other sci-fi/horror movie he ever  made in the '50s?  Indeed, but that likable Agar was the ULTIMATE hero in  these kind of pictures of this era so we forgive him.  Is Mara Corday still  one of the most beautiful leading ladies in '50s Sci-Fi/Horror film lore?  Whoa nelly, yes, although I still think she looked better with her hair  down in 'The Giant Claw'.  Are the special effects passable but do you get  one to many glimpses of a bad matte or incorrect scene placement of the 150  foot tall spider?  Geez, now you're just being picky.  Three letters  describe this movie;  F-U-N.  When I was a little kid, this was probably  my favorite monster movie to stay up and watch on the late late late show,  and to this day I still get a kick out of it.  The film benefits from the  talented direction of legendary Jack Arnold (Creature from the Black  Lagoon, The Incredible Shrinking Man,etc.) who is a master of keeping  suspense taut through 80 minutes and getting the most visually out of a  shot.  And there is a good performance by veteran actor Leo G. Carroll as  the well intentioned but ultimately mad (not to mention eventually horribly  deforemed) scientist who starts all this commotion.  Also has a somewhat  campy and overblown but nonetheless wonderful music score.  Don't think  about it too hard, these movies were never made to be taken very seriously  (I think these filmmakers would get such a kick out of seeing all the books  out there these days that overanalyze the heck out of these movies!).  Just  turn out the lights, make some popcorn and settle in on the couch for a fun  waste of time.  And, try to ignore that feeling of something slowly  crawling up your pantleg as you watch....eeeeeeeeeeee!

8105556,3,B000E3LIO0,"Yes, this is the ""Tarantula"" (with Leo G. Carroll) that is referenced in the Rocky Horror Picture Show opening song, ""Science Fiction Double Feature,"" which was a role-call of schlock sci-fi/horror films.  And "" Tarantula"" certainly earned its place in that roster.

While it's mostly a lot of pseudoscientific dialogue, ""Tarantula"" does stand out for some of its effects, such as the rear-screen projections of giant rodents (and the titular arachnid) in their lab cages, some miniature sets constructed to make the tarantula appear gigantic, and an early form of blue-screen technology that allowed live-action monsters to be superimposed on landscape shots.

The story is typical: Scientist tampering with growth hormones (or ""nutrients"") ends up mutating rodents, people, and our friend the tarantula into monstrosities.  Of course, the tarantula escapes and goes on a rampage until the Air Force steps in and roasts its ass with napalm.  Roll end credits.

For some reason, this film just doesn't pack the punch of a similar and cheesier giant bug movies such as ""Earth vs The Spider"" (later re-titled, simply, ""The Spider""), which used some of the same effects but incorporated teenage protagonists and was much more urgent than the rather languid, all-adult ""Tarantula""...I guess teenage fantasy films need teenage casts.
