8423407,5,B004CQZFEO,These are some of the world's leading thinkers and writers.  Their insights and eloquence are a complement to human intelligence and courage.  If only television could be even as remotely intelligent.  Fritz Pointer,1354406400,3,215,5.454545454545454
8423408,5,B004CQZFEO,"No interviewer matches Bill Moyers for intellectual, in-depth thought drawing ability. A set of PBS Moyers interviews, with celebrated authors. This is not a how-to study of writers' techniques, but instead a small glimpse into the impromptu minds' thought of 21 crown authors. Interviews originated from the late 80's to 2010. The authors came from a variety of country origins. Topics addressed include the occasional book by the author, politics, personal lifestyles, author beliefs, religion, dissent, and science. The list is more varied than the authors. This is NOT mass market paperback, steamy romance, or cookie-cutter Amish authors. These authors articulate on many topics, causes, or issues near to their hearts and writing topics.

These are intellectual literacy giants and will not be appreciated by all. But even those who typically read the lighter forms of publication may find a new writer to try. Personally, I immediately went to the library and checked out ""Shadow Tag"" (2010, Louise Erdrich). Some interviews will surprise, some will inspire, all enlighten and provide new insight into the authors' work.
