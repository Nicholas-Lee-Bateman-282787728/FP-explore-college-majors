1946698,1,B0000UJC5O,"I just recently started practicing yoga again after being away from it for a few years, and have been building a dvd library of yoga sessions. This dvd does not have the versatility that many other dvds offer. (i.e., being able to select from different workouts that might be 20, 30, 45, or an hour long, or focus on various areas of the body etc) this dvd does not offer any of these options. Further, when you choose to view the poses before you do the workout(an option from the main menu), he, Naader, just shows the poses one after the other (and shows the pose at the highest level) with no voice over, or text of what the pose is, the name of it, or how to properly move into the pose. And there is no example shown or verbally explained how to modify the pose for level of ability. Luckily this was not the first dvd I ordered, for if it was, I surely would have given up in frustration. He does the most unusual and extreme version of Sun Salutation I have ever seen. He starts out this beginner workout with a most unusual breathing exercise, that I might have been more interested in trying had he explained more about it, (ie when to breathe in or out, why your hands needed to be under your chin, and then bringing your head way back, anyone with neck problems would not want to try that in a beginning exercise,)He certainly is in fantastic shape, and is pleasant to look at, but that has no bearing on his teaching abilities that appear to be lacking severely in this dvd. Perhaps it's best to take his classes in person at his studio where you can get his individual attention. This dvd will surely be collecting dust on my shelf, as I don't even feel right about giving it away to anyone else, especially a beginner who might hurt themselves trying to copy what this teacher is doing on the screen. I would recommend any Rodney Yee, J.J. Gormley (from Body Wisdom) or Barbara Benagh (also from Body Wisdom)dvd.",1085097600,148,1927,4.385474860335195
1946699,5,B0000UJC5O,"If you want to join the millions of yoga practioners out there and start doing yoga, this is the best first place to start. Naadar, a noted yoga teacher in the Los Angeles area, guides you through the many poses of Hatha-style yoga. Having had the good fortune of taking classes with Naader in person, this video is the next best thing to attending an actual session. If you're a beginner looking to explore the yoga world or a practioner who can't find the time to attend a class, this and the other videos by Naadar are the way to go!",1072137600,13,536,4.316831683168317
1946700,5,B0000UJC5O,"I purchased this DVD for myself and have lent it to five family members!!!  For people new to hatha yoga, Naader Shagagi walks you through all of the poses.  The poses are just challenging enough to see results but not intimidating.  The format makes it easy to move through the series at your own pase.  My family members range in ages and physical fitness but they ALL LOVE THIS DVD!!!",1071014400,14,387,4.485714285714286
1946739,3,B0000UJC5O,This is good bit not quite what I expected. It was a bit to long on each pose.  I have better DVD's,1396051200,,99,3.5
1946740,5,B0000UJC5O,"I bought this DVDs a long time ago and I do yoga every day since 2004.

Naader Shagagi not only teaches you how to do the correct postures, but also helps calming your mind and body and kill daily stress.

I have done yoga with many instructors, but I have a strong preference for these DVDs.

I absolutely love it and recommend it.",1383177600,,332,4.238095238095238
1946741,1,B0000UJC5O,"I was really taken aback by this! All the reviewers who touted this as perfect for beginners are nuts. What beginners need is a cyclical, progressive way to learn to get flexible enough to do these postures! Or a fall back .. If you can't yet do this, then do it like that.  All this video has is a guy doing the postures in perfect form and telling you to do the same. THIS IS NOT INSTRUCTIONAL AND THEREFORE NOT FOR BEGINNERS!",1378684800,8,428,4.219512195121951
1946742,3,B0000UJC5O,Not what i really expected. I was looking for more step by step instructions around getting into the different poses and not just the quick movements of the yogi master. I also did not like that there was not a period of mediatation built into the routine.  I got something out of it but only because i had been exposed to different yogi positions. Would not get it without having had some experience first.,1351123200,2,407,4.5
1946743,5,B0000UJC5O,"I love Yoga.  I love the simplicity of this video, without any fanfare - just straight forward Yoga with healing music and understandable instruction with each position and enough time to enjoy and feel each position.  It is not rushed in the least, as I believe Yoga should be unrushed.  I feel restored after practicing Yoga with Shagagi.  I take with me wherever I go this DVD, and other Yoga DVD's and VHS tapes I have acquired over the years.",1308873600,3,447,4.55
1946744,1,B0000UJC5O,"I am a beginner to yoga and it was recommended to me to start with Hatha. I started taking classes at a studio and they have been great! For each pose we are given options. Sometimes I need the pose altered so that it is easier, and sometimes I need it to be more challenging. This is important for people just getting started with yoga. I have since fallen in love and cannot imagine ever not doing yoga. It's fantastic. I wanted to buy a video so that I could continue practicing at home in-between taking classes. This video seemed like a good option, but PLEASE do NOT buy this if you are just starting. ESPECIALLY if you are not also taking classes at a studio. I truly believe that if I was not taking classes, and had only bought this video to get started, that I would not still be doing yoga today. I would have thought that I was not capable of doing yoga and I would have given up. This video is NOT for beginners. It is nothing like taking a class, and obviously no video can be like taking a real class, but this video is just not geared towards helping beginners. Some of the poses are difficult and he does not offer any alternative if you are unable to make the pose he is doing. Please don't waste your money. I do HIGHLY recommend Hatha yoga. It is changing my life and how I feel every day. I feel calmer and healthier. If you can, take beginner classes at a studio, and look for a different DVD. I wish I had one to recommend but I too am still looking for a better option. Good Luck!",1279843200,6,1504,4.171821305841925
1946745,5,B0000UJC5O,DVD exactly as stated. Arrived in record time. One of the best Yoga DVD's out there in my opinion.,1259020800,,98,4.2105263157894735
1946746,5,B0000UJC5O,"Great for beginners!  This is the best Hatha Yoga tape that I have experienced.  I have been taking Hatha Yoga classes off and on for over 8 years and I was looking for an in-home program. If you want true Hatha Yoga instruction this is the video for you.  I say ""true"" because today's/Western yoga just gets you through the postures.  Hatha Yoga is not just moving through different postures, one is supposed to hold the pose and meditate in each posture for several seconds and eventually minutes.  Hatha Yoga is the practice of bringing together the body, mind and spirit through breathing, the postures and meditation and this video is the next best thing to a Hatha Yoga class.

If you want a real Eastern Hatha Yoga experience in the comfort of your home get this video.",1229385600,6,776,4.586956521739131
1946747,5,B0000UJC5O,"All of Naader's DVD's are stupendous. Just make sure and pick the one that's right for your level of practice, and you can't go wrong.",1225065600,2,134,4.4
1946748,4,B0000UJC5O,"The description does not fit the video content. This was suppose be a beginners guide, but the exercise is a bit advance. Don't get me wrong it's a great DVD but my wife and I needed a dvd that was for TRUE beginners.
The poses were a bit advanced for us.",1210291200,,255,4.019607843137255
1946758,4,B0000UJC5O,"I found this video to be very relaxing. I'm not nearly as flexible as he is but I made it work for me. Overall I think it was a great intro to yoga. A yoga video I REALLY like is Yoga Conditioning for Weight Loss with Suzanne Deason. Not too hard, not too easy (because there are 4 people practicing different variations of each pose).<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-Conditioning-for-Weight-Loss-Deluxe-DVD-Edition/dp/B00004TKIC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga Conditioning for Weight Loss - Deluxe DVD Edition</a>",1203638400,2,557,6.342105263157895
1946759,5,B0000UJC5O,As good as a yoga DVD can get... keeping in mind that it's difficult to get into position and then keep looking back at the TV.,1183939200,2,127,3.923076923076923
1946760,4,B0000UJC5O,"I am 35 with two small children.  With little free time, I don't exercise much.  I wanted to try hatha yoga because I was reading a book on women and stress.  The author suggested, among other things, to try hatha yoga.  I needed to find something to help me relax and to start to exercise again.  I have tried to start exercising again before, but I get discouraged that I get out of breath and can't seem to keep up with the models in top shape.  Although I am not as limber as Naader Shagagi (I would assume most people are not!),  I am able to do the yoga. The program did help me relax and my butt is firming up!  I am now getting up in the morning to start my day out with yoga. I don't mind getting up because it is a relaxing way to start out the day compared to other exercise videos were I dreaded working out.

I thought the one downside of the video was that he did not tell you what to do if you could not do the pose.  For example, there is a triangle pose where you need to bend over and touch the floor.  What do you do if you can't reach the floor?

I would recommend this product!",1163980800,9,1098,3.963470319634703
1946761,2,B0000UJC5O,"I am pretty new to yoga but I already have a pretty good library of dvds.  I thought this one offered a good variety of poses, it was a complete workout working on a mix of flexibility and strength.  Some of it was a little difficult for a beginner cause he does not offer any modifications.  He doesn't seem to practice yoga like anyone I have seen before either.  When he moves into postures he bounces.  He also over extends his knee on poses like  proud warrior.  I thought you were never suppose to do that.  Most of my cd's are performed in beautiful locations, this one is in a studio.  I personally feel the location adds a lot to the practice.  Its very relaxing to be looking out at the beautiful beaches of Hawaii or the sands of Death Valley.  He is not pleasant to look at or listen to.  This was the most expensive dvd I have bought and the most cheaply made.  Not worth the money.",1159660800,8,895,4.224852071005917
1946762,1,B0000UJC5O,Not at all for beginners - difficult poses w/out instruction.  Moves into positions in an abrupt and bouncy manner that has the potential to injure.  Not recommended.,1157500800,6,166,5.111111111111111
1946763,5,B0000UJC5O,"After doing Naader Shagagi's Ultimate Yoga series for only three weeks I healed a long time knee injury.  Along with healing benefits, I encourage my acting students to study these dvd series.  The benefits from breath work, flexibility and stength, self-knowledge, and confidence are priceless. The sequence is so practical and organic. Almost anyone can do these asanas yet mastering them will keep you challenged. I have done this dvd with my 14 year old daughter and 50 plus husband and there are gifts here for all ages. I have given this dvd as a gift to several friends as a way to show them how much I care about them.

1946764,5,B0000UJC5O,"I bought many yoga videos over the years, including Rodney Yee, and could not keep up with the moves....even though I've had some training by an instructor.  A friend gave me Naader Shagagi's yoga video and I had no problems following the program at all. Naader allows enough time to get into the position and to hold it, unlike many other videos I have tried.  I have since bought the entire series on DVD.  I am not the best exerciser...I don't tend to be regular in my yoga  practice, but when I do practice I just follow the routines in Naader Shagagi's program.  I still have all the ""other"" yoga videos I've bought over the years but Shagagi's are the only ones I ever use and they work wonderfully for me!",1131494400,22,712,4.404580152671755
1946765,5,B0000UJC5O,"There are a lot of yoga DVD's out there with frills, fancy settings and too much talking and chanting. Naader Shagagi's The Power of Hatha Yoga is simple yet challenging, to the point and perfect for beginners new to hatha yoga. It's set in a very simple studio setting, not on a beach or in a fancy Hawaiian landscape. There is so excessive chanting or new age hoopla in this one. He describes the poses, teaches you when and how to breath correctly and has, in my opinion, a very calming and soothing voice. I urge anyone interested in true Hatha yoga to check out Naader Shagagi and his series.",1120780800,22,597,4.4363636363636365
1946766,5,B0000UJC5O,"I am very new to hatha yoga (three months) and I am also overweight.  THIS DVD was the perfect introduction to practicing yoga and I have already lost 13 pounds!  The DVD is simple, easy to follow and Naader Shagagi is extremely encouraging in his instruction.  There is a simple set and if one is consistent in practicing this beginner's DVD, you will have amazing results!  Look at me.  I am finally gaining flexibility and my entire perspective of life is beginning to shift... JUST from practicing this series with Naader Shagagi.  I have already purchased gifts and turned my entire family on to the ""Power of Hatha Yoga""!  Please try this.  It could change your life!",1115078400,39,673,4.6923076923076925
1946767,5,B0000UJC5O,"I own many yoga dvds and have studied with many different teachers across the country. I am constantly updating my DVD collection so I can continue my yoga practice while travelling. When I bought this DVD, I was looking for a dvd that was closer to the heart of yoga and in turn found my own heart. Master teacher Naader demonstrates each pose without the help of headsets, overlit studios, and barbie doll models behind him. Naader's instructions, encouragements, and wisdom will bring you to the true meaning of yoga.

If you are ever in Pasadena/Los Angeles area, do whatever it takes to attend a class with Naader. During the one class I was able to attend,  he forever changed my view on the art of asana.  He opened my eyes and my heart to the benefits of the mental and spiritual side of yoga asanas.

 I have purchased this video for all of my friends and can't recommend it enough. The poses are accessible enough for absolute beginners while still feeling good for more advanced students.  While the technology on this dvd doesn't have the versitility of some others, what it lacks in glitz, it surpasses with its message and content.  While I think that there is nothing better for a beginner than practicing with a teacher in an actual yoga class as an introduction this is an excellent alternative for when you can't make it to class or in between sessions.

I am now working with the challenging series as well and feel as excited about that dvd as this one.

8003145,3,B0000UJC5O,"This dvd will never be a favorite of mine.  When I watched the poses, I was excited to think that these were all in this routine.  I was very disappointed that there were only a few poses and a lot of dead corpse pose or shavasnas.  I now understand that you probably have to buy all three dvd's in the series to get all of the poses.
 While he is probably a very good teacher in person, I did disagree with his style of teaching on this dvd and I felt it could cause injury to someone who has not done yoga before.  I don't recommend it to a beginner unless they have taken classes and know where to make adjustments so as not to cause themselves injury. Especially when he tells you to keep your knees straight or locked!  If you have any neck or lower back issues this is not the one to do until you are more flexible.",1434931200,4,821,4.068322981366459

I didn't care for this DVD at all.
It seems when an instructor has been practising for years they forget what it's like to be an actual beginner.
It's not that I am a beginner but I am 58 years old and even though I have been doing yoga for a few years now and I think for my age I can hold my own I found this a little too intense for me.

The biggest problem I have found in choosing a DVD for yoga is that most of them are from one extreme to the other.  The ones for older individual are too gentle but the ones for Hatha 1 or flow can be too extreme.  I will keep looking though. I just hate spending the money on a dvd only to have it sit on my shelf.
