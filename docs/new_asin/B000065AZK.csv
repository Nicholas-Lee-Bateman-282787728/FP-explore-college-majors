1707125,5,B000065AZK,This is a great work-out for anyone wanting to tone their arms quickly! If done regularly it really shows results in 2-3 weeks. Its fun and the instructor does a really good job of explaining the movements and breathing. I love this video.,1084492800,4,239,4.5813953488372094
1707126,5,B000065AZK,"Great video!  Love the variation in exercises.  This is a must buy at beginner, intermediate and maintenance levels.",1083628800,,116,5.388888888888889
1707127,4,B000065AZK,"This is definitely 1 of my favorite workouts.  I've been using this video at least 2x week for the past 3 months & I notice a HUGE difference in my arms.  I can still only use 3lb weights for the shoulders segment, but have moved on to 5lb weights for the rest.
I wish the triceps segment was repeated like the other segments so I would haven't to wait while the VCR rewinds back to the beginning of this segment, but this really isn't that big a deal.
I find I quite often have to hit fast forward as Dave tends to talk a lot...like prior to the concentration curls.  His chatter reduces this workout to approx. 25 mins (not incl. my extra triceps sets).
The women in his group aren't chatty at all, in fact they barely make a peep.  2 of them are so miserable looking throughout the workout you have to wonder if they were forced to workout against their will ;-)",1053648000,4,865,4.224242424242425
1707128,4,B000065AZK,"I have been using this tape 2-3 times per week for about a month and already have visible results in my arms, it is a great routine.....Dave says a few things that are a little chauvenistic (sp?) in my opinion, but after you listen to the tape once, you can very easily do the routine with the volume down. I use 5 lb. weights on this and its perfect, you can really feel it.",1028332800,8,375,4.081081081081081
1707129,4,B000065AZK,"Nice long warmup and cool down.  When I previewed this DVD I thought it was going to be way too easy, but after doing the first segment for shoulders I had to switch to lighter weights.  My friend thought he could do all the reps too but it was a little hard for him also.  I think this DVD is for beginners to intermediate and you can always use no weights or heavier weights for  a more strenous workout ... it will make you break a sweat.. I have been exercising for about 5 weeks now but this is the first time I have used a DVD geared for arms only. For most of the exercises he does 3 sets of 15 reps.  I didn't give it 5 stars because I wish the tape was just a little longer.",1027900800,10,683,3.884892086330935
1707130,5,B000065AZK,The best home exercise video ever!!!  And it gets the results you want...I have not been able to find it on DVD and can't hardly use my VHS tape anymore.  I just love it!!  Your arms look great!!,1379635200,,195,4.078947368421052
1707131,2,B000065AZK,"This dvd is boring and I found the host to be condescending. At most, this is a good starting point and is better than doing nothing at all. Perhaps doing this dvd will motivate you to find a better way to exercise. What I like the least about this video is that it does the least amount of workout on the underneath side of the arm; the part most women want to firm up. While I had the same idea as a previous reviewer in regards to pausing the dvd and doing 2 more rep's on my own, my second thought was 'why should I have to'? Why isn't this dvd made to be consistant, with 3 rep's for each segment. Poor editing, poor planning, and a really, really irritating host make this the least favorite workout dvd I've ever purchased. I would suggest spending your money on a dvd that is an all over body workout as you will get an even better workout for your body than this so called 'Sexy Arms' dvd can offer.",1271116800,2,908,4.135593220338983
1707132,4,B000065AZK,"This video gets right to the basics, but is effective!  A little too much talking, but you can fast forward throgh it.  It is perfect for someone like me who needs a little guidance while working out.  After a while, you can turn off the TV volume and put in a great CD!",1270684800,,270,4.056603773584905
1707133,2,B000065AZK,"This is one of the worst workout videos I have ever used. The women look scary, the music is dull and the instructor's comments are unnecessary. The first time I used it, the comments were ok, but he spends more time explaining what exercise we're about to do than he does actually leading the exercise. When I've used the DVD again, I put it on mute and play my own music. The up-side is that the moves are very simple. Other than that, I'd definitely pass this one up.",1266883200,2,470,4.292134831460674
1707134,2,B000065AZK,"I bought this DVD because it was exclusively devoted to arms.  The DVD does deliver in terms of showing you a good, basic arm workout for those of us that are newbies to free-weights. However, if you get this, be prepared to keep your finger on the fast forward button.  I feel the effectiveness of this DVD is watered down due to the hosts constant prattling on about nothing.  He moves extremely slow and constantly stops in the middle of the workout to talk.  Often about nothing that contributes to any knowledge of the exercises.  For example, mid-way through the workout, he stops and talks about how we consider biceps when we think about muscles, ""you know when you were a kid and your uncle asks you to show your muscles, you didn't show him this (extends his thigh), you showed him this (extends arms)"".  I found myself standing in front of the TV, dumbells in hand, rolling my eyes waiting for him to get through his endless digressions...and that was the FIRST time I watched it.  Each time, it gets more and more irritating so I have to keep the remote handy and forward through bits of the DVD many many times.  Again, if he could have just kept quiet and showed the exercises or at least kept us moving through all his talking, I would give this five stars. The workout is good if you can sift it through all his annoying banter.",1263427200,,1344,4.457142857142857
1707135,5,B000065AZK,This is a great arm toning video. I definitely saw a difference in my arms when I was doing the work out video religiously. It's a keeper!,1240444800,,138,4.148148148148148
1707136,4,B000065AZK,"The video seems like a 1980's or 1990's video. However, it is a good upper body workout,a nice way to target your arms if you are supplementing at home for the gym. I would definitely suggest it.",1237248000,,195,4.297297297297297
1707137,2,B000065AZK,"Exercises are effective, but moves too slowly for me.  I can get in every bit as much in 1/2 the time w/ some of the other DVDS.",1208044800,,128,3.740740740740741
1707138,4,B000065AZK,"This DVD does what it's supposed to do. It's straightforward and all about the arms. The host is not annoying in my opinion, he's just trying to motivate! LOL,
Well, as for the workout, there are 5 distinct segments,
Warm up, Shoulders, Triceps, Biceps and Forearms, and finally a warm down.
It is great for anyone who needs a good start in arm workouts, and it shows results, and isn't overwhelming in the least! =)",1205625600,,416,4.56

1707140,4,B000065AZK,I love this DVD. I bought this DVD to prepare for a April 07 wedding and it worked. Fast results!,1192233600,,97,3.9
1707141,4,B000065AZK,"Despite the other reveiws I read, I like the instructor - I enjoyed his ""nice job ladies!"" comments.

Short, pretty easy, and the type of video you do more often because you enjoy it - and surprising how quickly you see results. No wasted time (I just start doing reps while he's talking between exercises).

I'm glad I bought it.",1187222400,2,330,4.483333333333333
1707142,4,B000065AZK,"This is a simple, no frills workout that is probably best for Beginners in weight lifting (simple hand weights with many repetitions, which are very effective); absolute beginners can also practice without weights until they are comfortable with the moves.  The instructor does a simple routine that is easy to follow and gives advice about proper form.

Int-Adv will still get a workout if they use heavier weights, but they will likely find the video to be boring (not many variations).  Int-Avd exercisers should check out the weight-lifting based videos produced by The Firm.

Half hour video is taught by 1 guy and is divided into the following sections
*WARM-UP:  stretches
*SHOULDERS: 3 sets of 15 reps): Shoulder/Military Press, Lateral Raise, Bent Over Lateral Raise, stretch
*TRICEPS (1 set of 15 reps): Tricep Kickback, Overhead Triceps Extension, Reverse Dip(this dip will be difficult for beginners) [I wish he had more triceps work because it's disproportionate to so many biceps exercises; I would recommend repeating the Triceps section again
*BICEPS & FOREARMS (2 sets of 15-20 reps): Basic Curl, Concentration Curl, Hammer Curl, Power Grips,
*WARM-DOWN: isometric exercises (work the muscles by tensing them up) & stretches

If you are looking for a very fancy production, this is not it; but if you want someone to coach you through a short arm routine this may be what you're looking for.",1183420800,7,1408,5.126637554585153

1707144,4,B000065AZK,"This is a pretty good workout - I do it twice a week and feel stronger.  The pace is nice and it is challenging.  My only issue with it is how the instructor loves to say things like ""nice job ladies"", ""this is really going to give you sexy arms and when you're arms look sexy your whole body looks better"".  This, while his little workout group of all women gazes at him admiringly.  Anyways, it's a pretty good workout - I just have to mute it.",1179273600,,446,4.091954022988506
1707145,4,B000065AZK,It's hard to find a good arm workout on video/dvd and this is one of the best I've found.  The guy talks entirely too much which is annoying but I fast forward over him between exercises.  The set up is odd.  He does 3 sets of shoulders 1 set of triceps and 2 sets of biceps.  I only do 2 sets of shoulder and repeat the triceps to get 2 sets of those in too.  The funniest part is that he has HUGE arms and he uses 5 pound weights.  My arms are certainly tired afterwards and I am beginning to notice a difference.,1176336000,4,515,3.9038461538461537
1707146,2,B000065AZK,"The actual workout is a nice subsitute for when I can't make it to the gym for my normal arm routine.  With a moderate weight I am happy with the tone and am not building too much muscle.  I would probably use the workout more if I didn't find the host so obnoxious, with all his comments directed toward the ladies.  When I ordered the DVD I was hoping the host would have a similar tone as the guy on the ""Look Great Naked"" series, with encouragement geared towards the average woman's workout goals without sounding condensending.",1173571200,2,533,4.474226804123711
1707147,3,B000065AZK,"This video does have good classic toners but it does not seem like enough.

It starts with 3 sets of 3 different shoulder/back excercises

then moves on to one set of three different triceps-(which should have been three like the first set to make it more challenging) and last they hit the biceps and forarms. It moves pretty quickly but they tend to talk alot instead of just moving on with the excercises. I did not feel this dvd was challenging enough for me, it might even be to easy for a beginner. The video would have probably only been 15-20 minutes if they cut the talking in half (memorize and do on your own for a quicker workout), but the total running time is 35 minutes.

I rate this 3 stars because it is OK but not enough time or sets in my opinion.",1170892800,,766,4.268965517241379
1707148,5,B000065AZK,"While Dave Sinclair's promises of shaping arm muscles may be overstated, his exercises are solid in this 35-minute arm and shoulder workout. The buff infomercial pitchman leads four women in a three-part routine aimed specifically at females. After a five-minute warm-up, Sinclair starts with the deltoids, demonstrating three sets of shoulder presses, lateral raises, and bent-over lateral raises at 15 repetitions each. Then it's on to the triceps with kickbacks, overhead extensions, and reverse dips. The biceps and forearms get attention with three types of curls: basic, concentration, and hammer. After power grips, it's time for a four-minute warm-down with isometric poses and more stretches. This is an easy-to-follow but strenuous arm supplement to any workout. Although Sinclair says weights are not necessary, all of the on-screen exercisers use them.",1159574400,11,864,5.653846153846154
1707149,5,B000065AZK,"OK, despite the negative reviews of this item, I bought it anyway.  I am one of those people with an ""apple-shaped"" body, and I carry my extra flab in my upper body, especially shoulders and upper arms.  I have tried toning them many times; at home using instructions from books or magazines, and at the gym.  None of this ever worked.  Yes, the exercises in the video are not glamourous or new & trendy; they are the old-fashioned shoulder lifts, lateral raises, tricep kickbacks, etc.  However, the thing that really helped me is actually SEEING in motion how the exercises are done...because I realized that all the times I was doing the exact same exercises out of a magazine, I was doing them a little bit incorrectly, and therefore was not getting the effects.  I have only done the video for two weeks now (every other day), and I'm not going to lie and say my arms are sleek and toned after only two weeks, but I honestly can FEEL a difference.  I'm sure that if I keep up with this video that in another 4-6 weeks I will see a difference, too.

I don't know what the person was talking about in another review that you would have to have never lifted anything before in your life to feel a difference...I have done TONS of arm exercises and would hardly consider myself to be weak, and just using 3 lb weights fatigued my muscles after this workout.  The one thing I do agree with is they only go through the tricep workout once, which is totally weird because the guy flatout states that's the hardest part on your arms to tone, but I just rewind it and do it two more times, like the other exercise sets in the video.  And yeah, the guy is a bit annoying - he seems to talk too much, but that's hardly an issue - just fast forward to the exercises.  Good luck!",1157760000,5,1771,4.336363636363636

*Shoulders (3 sets of different exercises done several times)
*Triceps
*Biceps
*Forearms
*Warm Down

I haven't used this dvd in a while, and the last time I used it I was totally weak and couldn't get through it.  This time, I've been doing Yourself Fitness for a while (which uses weights), so my arms are stronger.

I used 3 lb. weights for this.

I liked this a lot, and I could definitely feel it.  It made me sweat a lot!  I don't think I'll be sore tomorrow (since my arms are in better shape than before), but I would recommend it.  Someone below said they do this every other day, and I think I'll incorporate this into an every other day routine.  I would love to have beautiful arms again.

One thing I liked about this, no frills, just arms.  that's what I want.

EDIT:  It's now 12/20/06.

I've been using this almost every other day for a couple of months.

Is there a difference?

Yes!!!

This is probably the BEST arms dvd out there.  I really recommend doing it.  The exercises are SOLID.

If you have flabby arms or you just want to keep your arms looking nice use this!

I am currently using 3 lb. weights with it.

1707151,2,B000065AZK,"After my first two years in college, I wanted to lose some of the weight I had gained. This DVD was cheap and I needed to tighten up my arms so I bought it. All I can say is I did this about twice and now it's collecting dust. Like another reviewer said, it is boring and the instructor talks way too much. I'm really not used to working out a lot, especially my arms but I found this too easy and way too boring. They definitely could have cut out some of the talking and made it quicker. It would be good to do if you only have a couple minutes but the lengthiness of it due to unnessecary talking makes that impossible.

Um, the instructor blabbering on about nothing.  The exercises are as basic as can be, you could do them without a DVD to follow because he doesn't switch things up at all to keep them interesting , and there isn't even any music to get into.  This is the least useful exercise DVD I own -- I know that sounds really negative, but anything by Denise Austin or QuickFix would be a lot more interesting and a lot more creatively put together.  You can find other DVDs with several different workouts on them so that you can rotate the routines, and for the same price.  Keep looking and don't buy this one!",1143072000,9,774,4.303448275862069
