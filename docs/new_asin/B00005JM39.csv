1489198,5,B00005JM39,"This is the title of the first installment of the amazing 20 hour mini-series (Steven Spielberg Presents) ""Taken"". This is one of the best mini series EVER made... of any genre.
 Congrats to the 10 directors; the writer; all the producers, actors, the visionary, Steven Spielberg, and everyone else who worked on this project.
 This mini series will not be soon forgotten.
(""My mom used to talk to me a lot about the sky. She liked to watch the clouds in the day and the stars at night. Espeically the stars. We used to play a game. A game called, ""What's beyond the sky"". We would imagine darkness, or a blinding light, or something else that we didn't know how to name. But, of course, that was just a game. There's nothing beyond the sky. The sky just is and it goes on and on, and we play all our games beneath it""- Allie)",1041811200,2,826,4.357142857142857
1489199,5,B00005JM39,"I loved ""Taken"". From the first moment I started watching it, I was hooked. That was two days and two hours each night for a week. ""Taken"" is really just about life and change and the decisions we make. This miniseries really touched me. I loved it.",1041465600,,249,4.319148936170213
1489200,5,B00005JM39,"I had to put my views on this movie, I thought this was the best
mini series ever. I couldn't wait to get home from work to watch this. My opinion I felt like I was there thats how real he made it. My whole family loved it also. this was the best show I have ever watched. I have watched other movies on aliens like the xfiles and close in counters of the third kind but I have never stayed so in tuned to this movie taken. I hope Mr. Spierlberg will come out with the conclusion to know if they will ever see there... well I guess I shouldnt say in case there is people who still haven't seen it yet!  I just hope the come out with another one with the same charactors has to have the same charactors... if you haven't seen it yet then my opinion defintely get the movie its well worth your money!",1041465600,13,798,3.9875
1489201,5,B00005JM39,"When I watched this on TV I was compelled to keep watching. The suspense was laid out so well so that every once and I while you'll be at the end of your seat then they'll let you relax again. Then finally when you get to the big finish (military vs. aliens) it's not over yet. I (personally) research paranormal and Taken uses a lot of real paranormal background. (look it up some time) They used real places and mentioned real people. But the most important part was that the movie wasn't just ""Ohhh we're aliens! Take me to your leader as we destroy you!"" They provided a differnet reason then war to come to Earth. To have a question answered. This is an obvious pivotal point in Scifi.",1041379200,2,690,4.3565891472868215
1489202,5,B00005JM39,"Back in the late 70's, Steven Spielberg brought us an awe-inspiring vision of the UFO phenomenenon with ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" (masterfully crafted and still my favorite movie to this day).  ""Taken"" updates the story of the ""visitors"" by bringing in research simply unavailable back in the 70's (with the exception, perhaps, of a select number of military personel ;)
With ""Taken"", it seems someone really did thier homework.  Interspersing recreations of the most common accounts of encounters with speculation about what might be one possible explanation for abductions and sightings, the result is this finely executed story of several generations of abductees and their encounters.
The main difference between Taken and Close Encounters is that in the latter we are presented with a vision we'd all like to share... Friendly aliens who are just curious and want to say ""Howdy"".  ""Taken"" postulates that although the visitors are super-advanced, they need us in order to breed a bit of something they've lost over time back into their gene pool.  Instead of having all the answers, we are forced to ponder, ""What if they are asking the same questions?""
One part of the conclusion, that asking these questions and pursuing the answers are what life is all about... whether you're alien or human (or a combination of both) is, I suspect, very close to what may be the truth of the matter.
Mr. Spileberg and some other very talented directors hit the mark with this mini-series. Get the DVD(s) when released, and set aside some time for a Taken marathon...
Then go outside and look at the stars.",1040428800,5,1609,4.970260223048327
1489203,4,B00005JM39,"The Sci Fi Channel did us all a great service by airing this ad nauseum for the next two or three weeks, for, though its beginnings were slow, I can now see where the show is going ... and I'm addicted.
The actors, most of them from the indie film circuit or relative unknowns, are impressive, as are the effects. But the story, my God, is the most compelling thing I've seen on television in years.
The series is 20 hours long, covers about 60 years of U.S. history and ""alien encounter"" history and, like a grand old soap opera, follows four generations of three families - all of whom are having encounters with aliens that seem to link them for some, so far unrevealed, purpose.
The purpose, I'm learning, is the creation of the story's narrator, the great-granddaughter of an alien abductee from the first episode and also the granddaughter of the alien hybrid baby conceived in the first episode. (The narrator, Dakota Fanning, is the best part about the series' final ten hours, by the way.)
But what do the aliens want with her? And what is she capable of? And why exactly is she, in some way, being planned by the aliens from the very first episode?
It falters a bit, but not much, around the third generation's stories, which took up the last week of the series when it first aired. But the point was driven home in what was, all points considered, a fulfilling finale.
That's what's kept me watching. This was great TV.",1040256000,16,1430,4.525096525096525
1489204,5,B00005JM39,"This movie was incredible ! It started of slow by setting a story and time line and introducing the charactor`s. It go`s thru the generation of the charactor`s and show`s how the alliens probed the humons thru the years. {Each night I had to watch to see what would happened.}As the story comes closer to the end, everything starts to come together. I hope that they come out with a sequal to this. They cannot let it end the way that they do. She must come back..... IT`S A MUST!!!",1039824000,4,482,4.366666666666666

1489379,4,B00005JM39,"I remember when this series aired. I really loved itback then and had always wanted to see it again since. I didn't even know it went to dvd until I came across this on Amazon recently.

Its a good UFO adubuction storyline that is quite imaginative and unique that spans the lives of three generations of three families. Two who keep getting taken and one obsessed with hiding and destroying it all going from WWII thru to the present and then the future briefly. They covered virtually every iconic UFO event in history, Roswell, the incident in PA, Area 51, you name it. But they gave alternative stories behind them all.

The scripting can be a little slow at times but the story arcs are strong and interesting. Would I recommend Spielberg Taken to friends and family?  Yes I would. Not only is it a blast from the past, its a good watch.",1520208000,,842,4.490196078431373

In fact, you NEVER fidn out where the aliens come from. Oh boy...andt the aliens? Effects have come a LONG way. The little grey men don't even look 3D. Starts out  promising, but it's a rolling a log up hill after the first episode. Some good acting that sitll can't save it. And wow, is that daughter of the colonel really, really bad. All she missed was twirling a moustache. Oh and that episode in the Northwest -- had NOTHING relevant to the rest of the story.

1489460,5,B00005JM39,"OK, its recording 
.
A remarkably wellmade multigenerational chronicle, beginning with one harried husband who was reluctantly rescued by alien arrivals from his Wicked Wife and her six sinister sisters. Whether its Barney & Betty Hill, or Fox & Samantha Mulder, whose to know if these terrifying tales of alien abduction are actually accurate?
.
A native son to the quiet hamlet of Franconia Notch, New Hampshire, this forlorn plumber had all the classic symptoms of unearthly abduction. (1) In late Winter humming noises began after an entire evening on YouTube spent blasting old Three Dog Night songs through his headphones. (2) Then, every time the LITTLE woman revved up her belittlebox, disorienting hours of lost time went absently missing. (3) In the Spring he began mowing grinning emoji faces into his front lawn. (4) Each week, after depositing his meager paycheck, he left the local bank feeling like he was being watched. (5) There was that deviated septum and the mysterious Summer sinus infections. (6) Finally, it all came to a head one cool Fall evening at dinner when he became mesmerized with carving a perfect silhouette of Donald J. Trumps head into a monstrous mound of mashed potatoes.
.
As was his custom, at 6:00 a.m. the next morning he dutifully departed for work. The Wicked Wife arrived home that night to a single lunchtime message he left on the feckless familys answering machine. In it he described how hed been assigned an emergency extraterrestrial sewercall to an old 1966 twinaxel Airstream Overland International trailer located at the Rangeland Court Motel & RV Park out in Crook County, Wyoming. The message ended with reassurance that hed come straight home when the task was sufficiently completed. And that was the last they ever heard of him.
.
Alright, done! You can turn the recorder off now. Hmm? What do you mean the batteries must have been dead?

(NOTE: What can one reviewer add about this excellent 2002 10part Spielberg miniseries? Hard to believe its been 16years since it first aired on the SciFi Channel.

1489552,5,B00005JM39,"I watched the mini-series on the Sci-Fi network back in 2002. I ordered my DVD set in 2006 and I've thoroughly enjoyed it every viewing.

This isn't so much the action/lasers/explosions kind of science fiction. Mostly in a mystery/journey about how the Keys family, Clarke family and the Crawford family change, interact and evolve (literalyl0 over generations. There are aliens, flying saucers, abductions and ""tests and experiments""

Taken is more a cerebral kind of science fiction and that's my favorite kind. Lots to think about and make me wonder. It draws me into the lives of all the characters and while there are good-guys and bad-guys they're not black and white. Instead all shades of grey (heh! heh!).

A lot of folks have talked about Dakota Fanning's key role. She also provides the narrator's voice. Impressive acting for someone so young. But don't forget all the other actors. The entire cast is quite good and I really liked Matt Frewer as Chet Wakeman.

I watched Taken again this week. Seem to pull i out every year or two. It's a story that holds up really well for me and 15 years later is still well worth viewing, especially if you like the more cerebral and progressive kind of science fiction. It should be no surprise I'm giving taken 5 stars. I keep on enjoying it.",1511136000,3,1294,4.737777777777778

However, it is not available to rent online anywhere. Found it on Amazon about 3 months ago and have been contemplating the DVD set purchase.

1489698,5,B00005JM39,"This set contains 10 episodes with some bonus stuff at the end on the last video.  The set has five disks and two episodes are on each disk.

I got tired of trying to piecemeal this series together by watching crummy versions of it on Youtube and decided it was worth the purchase.  IT was $23 not long ago but the price increased since last year to $32 so I figured I buy it sooner than later!  Glad I did!

Spielberg collects a pot full of historical references as well as Alien lore starting with the Roswell crash in July 1947.  The story line follows four generations, starting with a love affair between a human and a gentle Alien visitor.  Black budget Government mongols (and the mention of the Majestic 12 which has been declassified and released to the public), is referenced as well as other topics that pervade the whole Alien culture.  There are lots of historical reference points in this series that adds to the believability of the series.

In spite of the cold and murderous government agency research program headed up by an ambitious military colonel, following three generations in the family line, the series has plenty of love, heart, tension, even night terrors for two families and their three and four generations of Alien contact - all of what you would expect to find in Alien Grey lore and legend.  The series is extremely well acted and directed throughout.

The Aliens are not monsters, ""entities"", or malicious creatures trying to take over our planet as popular fear based folklore presents, but rather the series follows the more benign perspective.  One family and its generations feel continually threatened because of their own fears, while the other family seems to be able to handle the Alien interference a little bit softer.  The series seems to take on the perspective that the purpose of the Alien presence is their desire to understand more about life on Earth.  Their curiosity and desire to understand the human species is motivated by a plan to share the DNA of both human and Alien in order to bring something good to each species along the evolutionary path towards a higher life.

Condensing the bulk of Alien lore and reports by abductees, along with government greed for power, the series seems to sum up the gist of the Alien topic in just one season.  Wish it was more than one season.  But if it were to be more than one season where could it go but down?  To follow the X-files and other shows that looked for the next season's thrills by exploiting violence is not where this show goes.  It ends elegantly on a positive note with wonderment and touches the human heart and gives people hope.",1481500800,5,2647,4.665948275862069

It was great then, and while it doesn't quite hold up to modern-day aesthetics, it still has a great story to tell.  In the end though, it's almost to Ernest towards own good. The special-effects makeup is atrocious, and the acting is extremely subpar. Still a good final watch, but really not the best quality.

1490012,4,B00005JM39,I loved the TV mini-series when it aired many years ago. The DVD is exceptional.,1444176000,,80,4.4
1490013,5,B00005JM39,"One of the most amazing productions I have ever seen--in any category.  ""Taken"" is the phenomenal Steven Spielberg science fiction miniseries about the convergence of the lives of 3 familes through 5 decades of time--the long-suffering Keys, the ingenuous and kind Clarkes and the vicious Crawfords.  Each family plays a prime role in a story of alien abduction and experimentation, and of the  government cover-ups connected with that story.  The aliens' goal is to create a hybrid being having the best traits of the alien race and of the human race. The series chronicles the manipulative attempts of the aliens to bring this about (decades of abductions and experimentation on humans) and the effects of their efforts on the 3 families.  The pinnacle of the story is the birth of Allie Keys--the product of the union of the Keys family line. which is genetically compatible with alien DNA. and the Clarke family line which actually contains alien blood.  Allie has all of the goodness and emotional range of her human heritage and all of the power and special abilities of her alien hertiage.  The Crawford family is involved in military investigations of UFO's and extraterrestrial life and is obsessed with discovering the purpose of the aliens.  They are determined to discover the secrets of the Keys and Clarke families.
You will not see a production that has better quality or a more riveting storyline than ""Taken"".  The 10 episode series provides enough time to develop the characters fully and to allow us to become tremendously attached to them.  The casting directors were stunningly successful with casting this series--the actors are spot on.  Laura Karpman's score is haunting.  With every episode I felt a sense of ""coming home"" when I heard that wonderful theme music begin.
Every element of a good story is present--mystery, romance, betrayal, suffering, revenge, tenderness, viciousness, horror, wonder, heartbreak, triumph, and exhilaration.  I found myself hopelessly addicted.

1490017,2,B00005JM39,"First off, I'm not sure I can handle the idiocy of these terrible CG effects. Man...Spielberg and Lucas both stopped real movie-making so long ago and instead rely on terrible unrealistic computer animation. And so the industry follows. A midget in a body suit would have done much more for this film than this junk. And yah...I know I can't say ""midget"" anymore.

Taken ""takes"" a wealth of historical, verifiable and honestly shocking factual evidence and miss-mashes it with unrealistic melodrama and very poorly conceived SciFi. Why use the ""greys"", Roswell, etc. for this endeavor? Why not make something else up? And if you're going to tackle it - do it well. There is so much ripped off here from X-Files but not managed half as well...what's the point?

I should have known from the early stages with this little annoying girl-voice over - pontificating & condescending, that this was going to be some subtle anti-military, anti-Government, anti-American conspiracy idiocy which isn't even half as interesting as the real conspiracy-idiocy of Linda Howe, Bud Hopkins, and others.

Yep. Our military - pal with Nazis, murderers with glee and generally, portrayed as sociopathic nut jobs.

Now I know - I am certain that some people were killed to protect certain truths over the years. And that our military probably did some not-so-nice things to protect us from mass hysteria among other things. And Operation Paperclip and other such plans did put us in bed with some very bad people. But the way they're made out to be in this series is ridiculous. Even the tales from Roswell witnesses who were threatened don't come close to this lunacy.

Now, on to the Greys or whatever you want to call them - in reality, they look much more like us than these silly insect CGI messes. Ask those kids in Zimbabwe or Betty Hill. They're men...of a sort...and yet not. These guys look like ALIEN and a bad lucas-film revamp of Star Wars had a baby.

Acting is melodramatic and over the top. One saving grace here is that SOME...very little...but SOME facts stick around to make an interesting story.

But the bottom line is that the actual story - the actual facts - are scarier, more interesting, and more powerful than any of what's presented here. And I really don't need more Anti-Americanism in my media, even when masked by these infantile attacks on the Army/Airforce. Without them, these silly films would never exist.

End result is more garbage like this show obfuscates and makes getting the media to take a closer look at this issue almost impossible.",1437868800,,2559,4.853211009174312

But taken as a whole one has to recognize that this is merely a 20-hour version of Spielberg's 2+ hour Close Encounters of the Third Kind.  In that early movie we have all the elements seen here...the WWII abductions, the Government (Army/Air Force) coverups, some abductees being returned intact and healthy, and so  forth.  If you liked Close Encounters (as I did--I still view it every now and then) then I think you'll like this.  But if you're expecting something 'new' I think you'll feel let down.  It's good television, but that's really about all I can say for it.  And I could have done without the cutsy-voiced narration by Fanning and the long drawn-out 'fright movie' scenes of building tension that went nowhere.",1415577600,,950,4.7560975609756095

1490419,3,B00005JM39,"The first episode was fantastic and the period stuff excellent, old cars, hairdos...the Roswell crash, the character of kind Sally who knowingly took in an alien.
Unfortunately, what irritated me was the blowing wind signifying an oncoming abduction.
The narrative by Dakota Fanning who was spectaular as Allie and is an exceptional talent, sucked and was unneccessary.
HERE ARE SOME WRITING ERRORS...
Can you imagine leaving the door unlocked and open access to the original  survivingalien found at Roswell?  Walk right in as the character did...too much!
Imagine too, taking the dead alien bodies in a truck!!!!!! along with Eric Crawford's personal belongings!!!!  COMON!!!  What ever happened to TOP SECRET BEING FLOWN BY JET TO ANOTHER LOCATION WITH GUARDS....???? AND SOME GUARDS AT THE DOOR in the first episode after the crash, the guy just walks right in and leaves the door UNLOCKED AND FOUND IT UNLOCKED!!!! and UNGUARDED...TOO BAD!!!!!!  REALLY BAD WRITING....
The military people were stereotypical and boring and of course, no one family would have, in real life, all that higly classified information....
THE WORST IRRITATION WAS THE CHARACTERS AS THEY GREW THEIR HAIRCOLORS DID NOT EVEN REMOTELY MATCH!!!!!  One kid, Jesse, was a blonde teenager and then brown haired later....LISA was brown haired and then a red head....Charlie was brown haired and then BLACKHAIRED....
BAD, BAD, BAD Speilberg should do better!!!!!
i LIKED OWEN CRAWFORD THE ACTOR REMINDED ME OF  kEVIN bACON.  tHE ACTOR WHO PLAYED THE SON WAS BORING.
tHEY DESCRIBED THE SCIENTIST CHARACTER AS ""SQUIRLEY""  i HATED HIM-- HE WAS A JOKE AND A HALF.",1410739200,,1631,5.218390804597701

1490426,5,B00005JM39,"I first watched Taken when it debuted on SCIFI back in 2001/2. Starting about a year ago I had a hankering to watch it again. After watching the DVD set here are some of the things I noticed:

I had forgotten the details. Particularly the surviving aliens and the human attempts to learn about them had several different incidents. Knowing the storyline helped me to pick up clues that I missed the first time.

Keeping track of who was related to who. The diagram on the inside of the DVD pockets traced each family line and gave the actors name who portrayed that character.

The spaceships were more numerous and detailed.

The irritating Crawford family and their allies were not as irritating this time. They represented the twisted values that have become more commonplace the past few years.

Without commercials the story moved smoothly and more rapidly.",1407110400,3,862,4.836734693877551
1490427,5,B00005JM39,"More than a decade after premiering on broadcast TV, ""Taken"" maintains its grip, suspense and charm as one of the best treatments of the UFO genre stories committed to video.  No need to reprise the plot by me; others have described it well. What surprises me is it's persistence as a go-to miniseries for the dog-days of summer, despite competition from all newly available alternatives, Netflix and Amazon Instant video notwithstanding.  ""Fringe"" is fine, ""Continuum"" a great time travel story, ""Warehouse 13"" and ""Eureka"" are all wonderfully entertaining.  But the epic, novelistic storytelling of Spielberg's ""Taken"" is unmatched for scope - a story covering 50 years and four generations, interwoven plot lines with no incomplete story arcs, no ""lampshade hanging"" or other tropes marring the experience makes it a binge-watcher's delight.",1406937600,,844,5.427480916030534

Interesting alien tech, much more advanced than your typical star wars type stuff. Space travel in a ship without an engine? Wait till you find out what powers the alien craft. As advanced as they are, it's silly at times how oblivious they are to human tech at times.

If you don't mind watching a long series then it's also for you. Some people don't like watching hours and hours - so that's a personal choice.

The acting is supurb by everybody. You either love or hate a character depending on what they are doing and to whom. ha ha

If you aren't familiar with what this is even about I'm not going to spoil it for you. Suffice it to say that it covers several generations of several families that are involved in some way with a superior race that came to earth.  A child was born in the story and she is the central figure actually and is also the nararator, usuallly opening up the next chapter with a few wise words.

The only reason I would update this post later on is if I was watching the DVD's and found them to be of poor quality or some type of glitch. However, I doubt that's going to be the case.

1490760,5,B00005JM39,"If you are fascinated by UFO's, alien beings, and other supernatural phenomena, you'll enjoy this DVD.  Many may scoff at aliens invading our world, but I am convinced they have based on the government's coverup at Roswell, New Mexico.  There is no telling what the government knows but hasn't told Americans.  I have watched numerous accounts of UFO sightings and seen documentaries on them by noted Ufologists and authors, who have chronicled their accounts.  Especially scary is ""Communion"" by Whitley Strieber that describes his alleged extraterrestrial experiences with non-human beings.",1367193600,,592,5.544444444444444
1490816,5,B00005JM39,"For those of us who love the idea of Roswell, aliens among us and all the possibilities they could bring, this story rocks. Don't bother if your attention span is short or you're looking cheap thrills. This is a classy tale that ties all the crazy speculations we've heard for years into a seamless tale spanning three generations. A Sci-fi cliche is how the government would react to a visitation. Cliche maybe (as some naysayers have complained), but most of us sci-fi buffs are intelligent enough and have enough life experience to know how true the cliches are. I tend to immerse myself in a story and focus on that which I like. I look for and pull out those things which are uplifting and spiritually benificial - the things that I aspire to. Things if I put to practice in my own life would make me a better person. Taken is full of those things! One of the bittersweet messages I heard is that its very difficult to put the toothpaste back in the tube. Sometimes events take on a life of their own and no matter what we do or how much we want it to be better things can never be the same. Sometimes doing the right thing is the most painful thing of all. Sometimes life isn't fair and it doesn't make any sense but we have to move on and keep living. The story is narrated by Dakota Fanning who plays Allie, third generation product of an experiment. We don't get to meet Allie until mid-series after a lot of bad things have happened . I found myself waiting with great anticipation for that moment and I wasn't disappointed. Her performance as Allie was beautiful to watch. I fell in love with her character and her serious, big eyes. When the final credits were rolling Emmylou Harris sang a wonderful, sad, hopeful song called ""Just Before It Gets Dark"", that took me to a place in my heart that I don't visit often enough. The end of Taken left me feeling as if I'd just said goodbye to a good friend who I might never see again. The great thing about owning the series is that I can revisit my friend once in a while and we can talk about old times together. I highly recommend Taken.",1366675200,5,2098,4.354591836734694

1490819,5,B00005JM39,I really enjoyed this mini series.  The DVDs are good for going back and catching details that may have been missed.

Some characters are great, while others are insufferable. The story isn't very consistent and Dakota Fanning as the narrator is annoying as hell!

1490824,5,B00005JM39,"The first time that I have seen this show or mini-series was over 10 years ago, which I actually thought was long before that. It was first aired on a Sci-Fi channel and it was the last time that I ever watched it again until now. I had the show completely out of my mind and every time that I would hear or seen Dakota Fanning in other recent works, ""Taken"" came to mind instantly. That's the first show/movie that I ever seen her in, and since then, she always reminded me of that epic. She did a phenomenal job in that, and she was so remarkably yet otherworldly enchanting. Breath-taking, even. The fact that she was a narrator from the beginning to the end of the whole epic added those qualities to the show. At that time, I sincerely thought that she was an angel.

As for the show itself, I was a bit nave about the whole alien thing and wasn't all that into it. What I usually enjoyed was the story itself (not so much about the elements), and ""Taken"" was a good fictitious story about three generations, families and secrets, histories of alien abductions, a government cover-up, and so much more. Even if it has some elements in reality, it's still a good story. Knowing that this was Steven Spielberg's work, he had used this epic as a way to pursue or increase the possibilities of life in the outer space. The one thing that nagged me the most, now that I've seen it again, was the notion that the ""aliens"" had good intentions and the story behind them of having no hate or love being one of the reasons for their ""experiments"" on Earth. Of course, it's just a story, not a reality.

I just found it surprising that this epic wasn't aired more regularly or the DVDs released more widely distributed. For goodness' sake, it won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Miniseries. My eyes kept on rolling up about this and wondering why.

Nevertheless, I really enjoyed watching this miniseries ""for old times' sake."" It was refreshing to re-visit that memories of watching the show and re-feeling that excitement, that anticipation, when it first came out.",1358553600,9,2059,4.529569892473118

UPDATE:  I finally had the chance to sit down and watch all the episodes, and I'm disappointed to say that there are several very important scenes that have been cut out.  I hate it when they do that to DVDs, because if you haven't seen it before, then there are parts that make no sense.  maybe that's why some people have given this bad reviews.

The special effects are breathtaking, especially for a television movie, and are much like Close Encounters of the Third Kind or DT Phone Home. There is a touch of the strange while adding homey realistic touches that make the movie seem so real.

The acting is very good and as the movie proceeds you see how they physically age and gain maturity. Along the way the aliens continue to visit and affect not only the abductees but the researchers involved.

And if you don't like clowns you will love this movie. The clowns are not funny in Taken. They are scary.

The bad thing is when you finish you may want to keep putting in the next one in to watch. One interesting item I heard about this movie was for each segment they had to create a new movie set. They could not use the previous disc set due to the time frame of the each segment. It has government coverups and a great story line. I think I heard the whole movie cost around $40 million to make the movie. A great Saturday movie to watch. Start breakfast while you watch the first disc and be sure to hit the pause button when you leave the room so you won't miss any part. A great buy. A excellent buy if you find it at a garage sale.

1491016,5,B00005JM39,"I never would've thought that I'd become an occult follower of sci-fi films related to alien abductions and government conspiracies.
I will admit that all throughout ""Taken"" I wondered when Mulder and Scully would enter, stage left.
This is an earlier performance by a young actress by the name of ""Dakota Fanning"". She did brilliantly in this made-for-TV mini-series(How old was she in this film? 8 or 9?) showing her ability to portray an individual with keen sensitivities, mature insights, and child-like innocence.
There are 10 episodes, comprising a little less than a total of 20 hours of ""movie"". Each episode is a short movie in it's own right, but leaves you hanging for more to come.
The whole thing starts with the blue lights witnessed by airforce fighter pilots during WWII and continues through the crash of a UFO in Roswell New Mexico, crop-circles, weaved throughout the series are the intricacies of alien abduction, reported by those ""in the know"". The film stays true to those things abductees report having occured. This movie explores the reason the aliens invaded Earth in the first place: to re-introduce into their species evolutionary traits that've been lost as they've acheived higher-intelligence.
I enjoyed the twists and turns the show took my mind through, not only was this a sci-fi film, but also one of those ""mess with the mind"" flicks that catch my attention so well.
There was a little difficulty with following who the characters were, in the beginning of the series, simply due to very similar physical characteristics, and the changing of actors in portraying the same character, because of the need to show the passage of time. (The series takes us through 4 generations, in a matter of 10 episodes.)
There was one thing I remained confused by even as the series ended: what happened to the creepy carnival fellow and what was his role in the abductions?",1274659200,3,1896,4.946708463949843
1491017,5,B00005JM39,"I first watched this show on the SyFy network, I TiVoed the entire mini-series and was taken by the first episode.

Over the years, we've seen varius interpretations of the UFO phenomenon, the Roswell incident, abductions and conspiracy theories. In the wakes of X-Files and Dark Skies I thought the genre would have been done to death for now. Then came Taken.

Taken is a vast undertaking, a ten-episode mini-series, each episode the length of a feature film itself. It's certainly no small undertaking, especially when you consider just how clever the whole project is.

What is Taken then? Well, I'll try not to give away too many spoilers, because it's definately a story you should go into blind.

It starts in the skies over Germany in World War II, where a bomber crew in dire straits encounter something strange in the unfriendly skies.

The story quickly transfers back to America, in the years following the war and quickly focuses on three characters, A young mother in an unhappy marriage, the returning hero to small town america and an Amry Air force intelligence officer stationed at Roswell Air Force Base.

These three characters form the roots of the whole story, as it's their experiences, and the experiences of their families over the next few generations, that carries the story along.

It's a veritable history of the UFO experience, crafted into a single, well thought out story and tied to real world events, from Roswell, through the cuban missile crisis and into the present day. The lives of the three families overlaps on numerous occasions, and it is the different viewpoints of these families which gives the show real heart.

Each families experience of the visitors is different in perspective. The family of Owen Crawford, the Intelligence officer who goes on to command the US investigation into the saucers, experience the whole thing from a conspiratorial and analytical viewpoint.

The Keys family, The Bomber captain and his progeny know only fear, they resent their abductions and continually fight back.

The Clarke Family are ones blessed by their encounters, subsequent generations affected by their matriarchs encounter.

The story is slow to unfold, but that never means that things themselves move slowly. In fact this is certainly an intense piece of work as there's rarely a scene that doesn't carry important information.

The cast is excellent, and the characters superb. Special note should go to Joel Gretsch, who plays Owen Crawford, possibly one of the nastiest pieces of work I've seen in a long time. He manages to play his character effectively as a charming, smiling sociopath, and is eminently watchable. Also enjoyable is Matt Frewer, who comes into the series quite late as Dr Chet Wakeman who works for the government investgators. His sarcastic, knowing character gets many stand out scenes as he becomes established.

Visually, the show is stunning, each of the first six episodes is set in a distinct time period, and suceeds in achieving the feel of that period excellently, really conveying an epic feel to the whole thing.

You don't need to be a believer in UFOs to like this stroy, you really don't. It's a first rate drama that really shoudn't be missed. The DVD provides you with the fifteen hours of the show plus a documentary on the making, so that's well worth a look.

If you get the chance to watch this though, go for it. It's clever, thoughtful, but most of all, you will be taken by ""Taken"".",1271548800,2,3473,4.9229452054794525

1491092,3,B00005JM39,"First of all, if you approach ""Taken"" with the intent to savor some special effects or gaze upon various sorts of aliens and spacecrafts, then forget it. Of the 15 hours of programming here, there is a total of about ten proper minutes with aliens. That is a SERIOUS lack of alien, in my opinion. Even with low expectations, ""Taken"" falters, only because it promises so many things and delivers on absolutely nothing.

The concept of three generations starting from the 1940s to the 2000s seems interesting, but in practice it seems a bit muddled. By Episode Six, you feel a bit dissociated from all the characters - this might have to do with the casting. The first four episodes of ""Taken"" are the best - the vintage scenario and pitch perfect Julie Benz, coupled with the initial start of UFOlogy itself is a treat to watch, but as the story shifts more and more into the modern era, it gets more confused.

Its also clear that by Episode Seven that the writers literally had no idea to go (which would also explain the ridiculously bad series finale). But perhaps the worst thing here is the dull, sappy and monotonous voice-over by Dakota Fanning. There are about five to six of these lengthy 'gems' every episode. Which genius thought that Dakota Fanning, a hugely overrated child star, could ever infuse dull passages of 'spiritual wisdom' with any life? Also, these voiceovers have nothing in common with the scenes they accompany. Case in point, you have a man walking toward a car, entering the car, and then driving away. The entire non-scene is punctuated by Dakota's voice that says : ""Which of us is truly good or bad? Is goodness every really measured? Is man inherently good, or could it be that the universe doesn't really distinguish between either. I guess we'll never know"". THAT is the level of sophistication this show has, and if you're a sappy ten year old that weeps at Hallmark cards, then good luck, this show was made for you.

At the end, despite some excellent production and reasonably interesting storylines, ""Taken"" falters because it is pretentious, and badly cast. The script doesn't do it any favors, and NO resolution is given as to why the aliens want to abduct people and conduct experiments. Also, given that they've supposedly been doing this for sixty years and SO many people have been abducted, at least give us SOME fictional sense of what is going on. Instead, we have one sordid love story after the other with no direction whatsoever, and it all plays out like some boring afternoon soap, with some sci-fi thrown in every now and then to remind you that you are watching Spielberg.

Give this one a miss. There are much better shows out there on the same subject (""The 4400"", for example is at least ten times as good as this). Its also a bit shocking that people are giving ""Taken"" such good reviews because its pretty much a 15-hour long love story with some really uninteresting leads, all of whom have some 'alien connection' that is NEVER truly explained. You will feel cheated and ripped off, and at this price, its a crime that they can get away with this.

PLOT - it's all in the description above. Anymore might spoil it.

SPIELBERG - Yeah, he's only listed as a producer BUT this show has Spielberg all over it.

LENGTH - 5 DVDs tanking in at 15 hours plus a bonus DVD of extras.

SPIELBERG - Did I mention that Spielberg was clearly all over this thing like a cheap suit and if you didn't know any better you'd say it was directed by him?

SUITABILITY - May not be appropriate for younger viewers.

HEALTH CONCERNS - Classic Spielberg tension-building throughout. Parts of it will have you on the edge of your seat and your heart pounding.

SPIELBERG - Did I mention that this is classic Steven Spielberg?

SLEEP DEPRIVATION WARNING - Be careful when you start watching this. You may end up into the wee, wee hours. At first, I watched a DVD a night (3 hours +/-). Then, on the third night, I watched the remaining three (9 hours +/-). Couldn't stop.

BOTTOM LINE - This is a grand, sprawling Steven Spielberg epic on alien abduction. 15 riveting hours of the master at work. It simply doesn't get any better than this.

1491134,5,B00005JM39,"People have been reporting abductions since - well, since longer than we want to let on. One of the stories in the series in a story about a bomber crew in world War 2 that experienced just that; they saw lights in the sky and a ""something"" they couldn't understand and then - and then everything changed. Supposing there really are aliens and supposing these people really are telling the truth about being pulled into bright lights and having no recollection of what transpired, what exactly does that mean? Sometimes it seemed to mean something more, like a person wouldn't be allowed to be harmed because ""something"" seemed to keep a constant vigil over them, and sometimes a person would only be taken once and never remember it again. That's the beauty of the story; the puzzle that starts coming together like an enigmatic puzzle coming together.

Taken is a 10 part mini-series that ponders this and more, following three main families that are either in the ""close encounters"" arena, in the ""alien hunters"" arena, or are in some other arena that goes deeper than that either understands. It tracks these people through generations, three to be exact, as something starts developing in the 40s and keeps developing until - well, until that ""something"" occurs. The beautiful thing herein is that the pay-off isn't in the end or even in some of the story arcs but is instead hidden amongst the details and the derails and the utter humanity that is so easily overlooked. With vocal points provided by Dakota Fanning, this points are sometimes profound and sometimes touching and sometimes both and more.
It really is surprising when you find a series with this much scope and find that it has something to say as well.

When I first watched this series, I had low expectations for what was being presented because I am no lover of Spielberg's depictions of what is ""alien."" He oftentimes seems to have a very tolerant view in light of the other material he also shows - abductions and mutilations and the like. I also find that aliens aren't the best things to watch because they have a certain ""depiction"" people normally see; you have a specific build and a specific mode of travel and those things aren't deviated from. Here, however, Spielberg goes outside this normative box and shows all sides of the equation, pointing out how humans can be very inhumane and how something alien can have all the flaws a person has and more. Combine that with a cast that has talent, a story that really has time to take and build, and you have a thing that is worth watching - and worth watching a second time over.
It was, in fact, the third time I watched it that everything clicked and I really found myself amazed.
This is more adult than you would expect, good for alien and non-alien movie watchers alike, and is filled with surprises. I recommend it highly.",1184803200,9,2861,4.697211155378486

OK, the story is pure hokum and the characters can be decidedly odd, ranging from the angelic, wise-beyond-her-years Ally to the villainous Crawford tribe, who are so bad that you have to resist the temptation to boo them every time they appear, as in a traditional English pantomime. But it gets you in. Part of the appeal appears to be that the thing is just so beautifully realised  - the contemporary settings seem absolutely perfect - that it's irresistible. You find yourself wishing that that there were really something to it - and perhaps this is the other part of the appeal, something encountered in ""The X-Files"", that there is something beyond what is officially presented and that it's being covered up. Perhaps there's something in us that enjoys a good conspiracy theory, perhaps because we like to think that the world isn't just a series of accidents and happenstances.

Its nothing like the hokey, B-movie, sci-fi waste of money that they produce today.

This story has depth, drama, action, mystery, with a sci-fi backdrop. Its really a story about people, family bods, and the depths of human nature and what makes us human. The alien story is just the glue that pulls all the characters together and movies the story along.
I've been looking for this movie for a very long while and I'm sooo happy to finally find it here for much less then originally priced (in the $100 range).

1491182,5,B00005JM39,"First off, I'd like to say that I in no way intend to pan this phenomenal film, but I'll leave the praise to the other reviewers, as I think they've done so adeptly.  I enjoyed this movie immensely, and have managed to sit through it four times.  The rather large pricetag is worth it, in my opinion.  Performances are excellent, script is by and large excellent, perhaps a bit forced at times to push the story forward, but overall excellent.

That said, the sound mixing in the movie is perhaps the worst I have ever heard.  Honestly, the lead engineer must specialize in annoying people with ""hot"" voice-over recordings, because he jammed the microphone volume on Dakota Fanning's narrative so high that it's painful to listen to.  Have you ever noticed that many pharmaceutical company commercials have women who whisper into a microphone and you can hear the wet, sticky noises that their tongues make while moving around inside their mouths?  That's called microphone volume (as opposed to master volume), and hearing subvocal noises is generally a no-no, but some people feel that it contains a maternal and personal quality that conveys comfort and trust.  Mostly, I think it's like listening to someone chew gum into a microphone.

So if you've ever been annoyed by voice-overs or you have difficulty listening to NPR, be warned that Dakota Fanning's narrative in this film is beyond atrocious, through no fault of her own.  Her performance is excellent, her dialogue is excellent, but her engineer single-handedly cheapened this otherwise amazing film with his astonishing incompetence.  But that's just my opinion.",1146960000,5,1625,5.048689138576779
1491183,4,B00005JM39,"This is a very, very, very long film ... an epic (6 dvd disks that will kill almost 15 hours out of your life), so it came as a surprise that it kept my interest enough to watch it until the end.  Oh, I think they could (and should) have tightened this up by nipping two or three hours (or more) out of this series, and not everything works in this film (example:  they did a pour job aging the actors and some of the sub-plots were weak, run-of-the-mill, and unconvincing), but it is a far cry from most of the cheesy sci-fi corrupting the airways on the sci-fi channel.  The truth is, I rarely watch anything on the sci-fi channel because I find almost all of it laughable at best.  Sci-fi is ripe for sub-B scripts, dumb dialog, and poor acting, and the Sci-fi channel is notorious for airing unadulterated crap.  Is it any wonder that most people don't like sci-fi?

TAKEN, however, is surprisingly sophisticated in its approach and direction.  And there are scenes that are truly disturbing (this isn't light fare).  Perhaps it helped that Steven Spielberg produced this series.  It looks like they really did some solid research in the UFO/abduction field when coming up with this script.  And while none of the actors were house-hold names when this film aired, most did a fine job throughout this series.  The plot is simple enough (are the aliens evil, or good, or something else?), but it is the execution of this simple script that makes this series worth watching.  It spans more than 50 years of the UFO phenomena and centers upon alien abduction and government involvement and cover-ups.  Whether you believe in aliens and alien abductions (or government cover-ups for that matter) or think it's all hogwash, this film will keep you interested (although some episodes aren't quite up to par with most of this film).

I don't really know when this series was produced.  I've seen dates that range from 1998 to 2002.  But I do know that Dakota Fanning was quite young (4, 5, 6, or 7 years old, depending upon when this was actually filmed).  And I guess that's what surprised me the most.  This little girl must have a genius IQ (she narrated the entire series) and is now (at age 11) considered to be one of the most gifted actors/actresses working in Hollywood.  And yes, she is the highlight of this film (even though she appears toward the end of the series), as she is the highlight of every film that she has made.  I also don't know what it is that fascinates people (as well as me) so much concerning Dakota.  A fine actress?  Yes.  Believable in every part she has played?  Yes again.  I do know that she feels like a breath of fresh air every time I have watched her (whether in movies or in interviews).

So, if you are looking to kill an entire weekend (and perhaps a good portion of the week), pick up this fine film (if you are lucky enough to find it).  Between 1 and 10, I give TAKEN a solid 8.",1146268800,8,2922,4.474480151228733

The only reason I watched the 1st episode because nothing else was on. I was hooked from the first five minutes. This mini series is awesome. There is not a lot of big name actors in this movie but that adds to the mood. It does have an outstanding performance by Dakota Fanning. She doesn't show up until about halfway through the series, but she does narrarate the entire movie and does a damn good job of it. I think that the list of unrecognizable actors do a superb job. All I can say is that this series is addictive. Watching it on Sci-fi was great, but after each episode I was more than ready to see the next. Owning the DVD is makes it even better. I can clear a weekend, and spend it watching the entire series. Yes it's that long. I have found that is the only way to watch TV today. Wait until the DVD comes out and watch an entire series at once, whether it is the X-Files, Rescue Me, Northern Exposure, and whatever you like.

Dakota Fanning has always been a primo narrator.  I'm sure that the powers-that-be behind ""In the Realms of the Unreal"" Henry Darger documentary remembered Dakota's engaging contribution to Taken and enlisted her for the narration of their film, too.  But I digress.

After a long day, it's great to sit down and watch a movie. I rummage through my DVD shelf, browsing the titles I own. Nothing appeals to me. I'm in the mood to watch something I've never seen before, and all the films I own I've seen about 500 times each.

So, I jump in my car and take a ride to Blockbuster. I park my car, go in, and start looking. I'm by the sci/fi section in the back and  I see five colorful boxes labeled ""TAKEN"" near the bottom of the shelf. I pick up Volume One and read the back, discovering it's a miniseries from Leslie Bohem and Steven Spielburg involving ufology, each episode lasting 90 minutes.

Now I've always been a firm believer of UFOs and extra-terrestrial life, so I think to myself, why not?

So I rent Volume One and drive home. It's now 10:00, and I pop in the movie into my DVD player and sit down on my couch with nice pillow. I kick out my built-in footrest and grab the remote. Little did I know I was in for the ride of my life.

I was blown away at the show. Really. I was expecting some cheesy show about people making friends with aliens but what I got was something else. The first episode took my breath away. I was tempted to watch the next one but I was exhausted from the day so I went to bed.

Sunday night I watched the next one. I liked it even more than the first one.

I just finished watching the last episode of Volume Five. It was absolutely brilliant. The acting is superb; I've never seen actors and actresses act like they did. Dakota Fanning is simply amazing.

The show is full of suspense, emotion, cool CGI effects, adventure, and mystery. That's everything I love in a film.

My favorite TV show used to be House that airs on FOX. Now it's Taken, and it takes a hell of a lot of power for a film to be one of my favorite films.

Allie Keys is now up there on my ""Favorite Sci/Fi Characters"" list along with Darth Vader.

For people who believe in UFOs, you will rate this 5 stars.

For people who don't believe in UFOs will rate this 3 stars.

I recommend not watching this show if you don't.

WARNING--the show isn't exactly kid-friendly. There are some very violent scenes, strong language, and some other content kids shouldn't be exposed to (I think you know what I'm talking about).

You will not be disappointed with this show. I guarantee it.",1133740800,,2346,4.261851015801354

Would have been very cool, just as a cameo, in something of an information sharing moment between the Air Force and the FBI.

Very glad to see Heather Donahue again.  I was wondering when she would resurface after Blair Witch, and must say, she has really matured.  Like Scully, she looks gorgeous as a red-head!!

  I especially appreciated what they did with the cars, since this was a period piece.  Must have been a ball, rounding up these old timers, and making them look new.  Only ONE drawback that stood out as a glaring oversight.  The time caption was 1962 and there is a Plymouth Fury that is clearly a 1963, in the scene.

1491226,4,B00005JM39,"""Steven Spielberg Presents Taken"" is a 10-part maxi-series that spins a story of alien abduction and genetic experimentation out of the infamous story of the crash of a U.F.O. at Roswell, New Mexico. Actually ""Taken"" begins at the end of World War II, when aliens first abduct B-17 bomber pilot Russell Keys (Steve Burton) and his crew during a bomb run over Germany. For the rest of the century the life of Keys and his descendants will cross paths with two other families. Sally Clarke (Catherine Dent) takes an alien visitor (Eric Close) into her home, and ends up bearing his child. Eventually the grandchildren of these Russell and Sally will come together and produce the end product of the alien's breeding program. On the other side of the equation are the Crawfords, the first generation of which is Major Owen Crawford (Joel Gretsch), who is in charge of the Air Force's program to answer the mystery of the aliens.

Major Crawford is your stereotypical warped military commander who is completely obsessed by his project. The nicest thing you can say about him is that he is not a sadistic bully, just a murdering bully. No wonder General Hammond on ""Stargate SG-1"" is such a breath of fresh air. In Crawford's case it is nurture and not nature that warps his two sons and granddaughter and has them following in the family business. Basically the plot is a chess game between Crawford, the Air Force, and his scientists versus the aliens, in which the humans are almost always a step behind and a day late, whether they are trying to understand what the aliens are doing or trying to step the visitors from making the next move.

For most of ""Taken"" the audience knows little more than any of the characters. Even being privy to both sides provides little help. Actually the most important thing to pick up on during the first half of the series is the voice of the young girl doing the voice over narration in these episodes. That is because the payoff for this story is young Allison Clarke and it is not until young Dakota Fanning (what ever happened to her?) appears on screen that ""Taken"" really gets off the ground. Before that part the most interesting character is Owen Crawford, who is not a pleasant person.

Of course, this is the exact opposite of so many science fiction stories, where the set ups are great but the payoffs extremely unsatisfying. That is not the problem here, and if you have to struggle through the first half of ""Taken"" to get to this little girl, then make yourself do it. The result gets what would have been a mediocre science fiction series up to the level of being a good one. There really is not a big payoff in terms of the end of the story, either in terms of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" or ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" it all comes down to the little girl.

With her alien genetic background and what we have already seen some of her ancestors do when they were kids, you know that little Allie is going to be able to do some astounding things. But the most impressive thing she does is talk to others. People like to talk to her, she observes at one point, and for most of her time in ""Taken"" Allie looks like a cute little girl but also projects a calmness and sense of wisdom that are quite captivating. My favorite scenes are when she suddenly turns to an adult and says a sentence of such penetrating insight that it blows you away.

Maybe I am making too much of this. Given how low the bar is set in ""Taken"" it might be relatively easy for an 8-year-old to dazzle us. But given the resume Dakota Fanning has put together in this half of her life from ""I Am Sam"" and ""Uptown Girls"" to ""Man on Fire"" and ""War of the Worlds.""  No wonder I really started paying attention in ""Taken"" once she showed up.",1119484800,3,3759,4.48029197080292
1491227,5,B00005JM39,"A superior mini-series in almost every way.  Mostly well-acted and written.  Well paced for a TV show. Acceptable special effects.  Good craftsmanship.

Based on the Amazon listing, it would seem the DVD set is out of print.  I was able to rent it from my local store, otherwise might never have seen it. Don't have cable.  This miniseries once again proves how invaluable DVDs have become.  A decade ago, those who didn't see it originally would never have had the chance to experience it.

Basically, it's an alien invasion / conspiracy show, spanning four generations, from WWII to ""present day"" (about 1999/2000).  The show follows three different families.  One begins with a lonely housewife in Lubbock who has a crazy fling with a wounded young man who turns out to be an alien.  Their offspring is the beginning of the aliens' plan.  Another family starts with a WWII pilot/hero who is ""taken"" during a bombing run and is the only crew member who is able to survive the ""work"" that the aliens have done to him...thus, he has something in his genes that they want.  Finally, the Crawford family are the villains of the piece, starting with Owen Crawford, a military man who is interested in hiding the truth of the Roswell crash as well as discovering the secrets to alien technology and to their plans for the earth.  His goals are actually admirable...his methods are another story!!

Most of the actors are unknowns or perhaps familiar faces whom we've never put names to.  But most are quite solid.  In my opinion, the earlier episodes are the best, because they're set in another time.  We're so used (thanks to X-FILES) to modern day abduction stories...it's kinda fun to see the mythology of them develop in the 40's, '50s and '60s.  Standout performances include the actor playing Owen Crawford and Dakota Fanning, who appears much later in the show.  She's got the same eerie calm that Haley Joel Osment had at a young age.  Actually, there are several young actors throughout the series, and they are all excellent.  Towards the end, our two major villains are played by Matt Frewer (Max Headroom!) and Heather Donohue (Blair Witch Project).  They are a bit over the top, and have to play a line between insane and just plain nutso.  Mostly they succeed, but they are a bit annoying.

The story is solid throughout all fifteen hours (10 episodes at 90 minutes each..it's a little movie each time).  We become very attached to the characters and involved in their fates.  Some stories play out in a sweet manner, others are bittersweet.  It's got romances that are actually believable.  It's got some action and some sprinkles of humor.  It's mostly a character drama though, exploring how ""ordinary"" people react in extraordinary situations.  I liked it very much.

Just be ready to put in a lot of time.  My family and I found we couldn't just watch it occasionally, so we basically saw the whole thing in about a week.  But it was still sad to say goodbye.  And speaking of families...this is a good show for kids age 11 and up or so.  The violence is mostly tepid. There are a couple of mild ""bedroom"" scenes, but otherwise it's just good drama.  I was VERY pleasantly surprised at the entertainment value in this series.  CHECK IT OUT!",1118966400,19,3256,4.727758007117438
1491228,5,B00005JM39,"Just so you all know, Steven Spielberg did not direct any episodes of Taken.  Amazon and some of the reviewers have this wrong.  He served as executive producer on the series.",1118880000,4,175,4.612903225806452

I loved it and bought it and after 3 times watching it from beginning till the end, I still watch some episodes occasionally! The only problem in this miniseries that I have to mention is, people were aging so fast and were dying young. for exapmle in less than 20 years, a young lady at her late 30s, was become a 90 years old-like lady. It was the only problem that I Could find in this series. anyway it's not that important, due to very good production, enought budget, excellent actings and a brilliant story, you'll difinately enjoy it.",1118188800,,600,4.414414414414415
1491230,2,B00005JM39,"At the beginning all seem perfect, so perfect. The cast, the music the story, but later all become the brick of a wall of contradictions.

  I like the work of Spielberg, but if there is something I hate it's when someone try to make me believe in something with a bunch of bad facts.

Taken its a miniseries about to stories: The first one: the tragedy of the people who were abducted, and the hunt of the alines who maken it. The second (and the worst): The kindness of the aliens agains't the evil forces of the agency who are hunting them.

  But what it's worst of these show: in the end the story tell nothing new about the abductions (except of course the chance of the aliens after all what they did, they could be a good race). There's no new and good theory about these theme, just an story were the good people are almost saints and the bad people seems to be sons of the devil, and in a show who try to be something serious about a theme like this, this is a big and unforgiven sin.",1105315200,2,994,4.172774869109948
1491231,2,B00005JM39,"I just watched the final episode of Taken last night, and yes, I felt taken.  Having invested considerable time in the series, hoping for an entertaining payoff, both my wife and I were simply delighted that the experience was finally over.  Taken is nothing if not long, tedious, annoying and formulaic.  Each episode promises one shot of the aliens and one shot of the spaceships, regardless of how intergral to the plot that may or may not be--but don't get excited, the special effects are nothing special.  You've seen it all before, pretty much, and better.  And every episode is narrated by an annoyingly whiny little girl, who seems like the font of wisdom until you listen to what she's actually saying--granted, some of this may appeal to a certain crowd, but at some point in your life you need to grow up and get over these juvenile, high school platitudes.  Guess what, it isn't the question that counts, and it doesn't matter if we can't answer it--this was the final bit of wisdom from the skies!  If answers didn't matter, we'd still be sitting around dirty and naked in a cave, scratching our fleabites and saying to each other, ""I'm freezing!  I wonder if there's a way we could get warm?""  ""I dunno, I wonder if there's a way we could stop the saber-tooth tiger from eating our kids?""

I'm not just a curmudgeon, I'm a just curmudgeon.  It's not that I hate Sci-Fi, I love it; it's not that I hate Steven Spielberg, I usually am thrilled by his work.  It's that this drawn-out series promised so much and delivered so little, and so little new.  Close Encounters of the Third Kind was a fantastic movie, one of the best of it's type ever made, and Speilberg really broke new ground with it.  Taken is a ten episode, multi-generational version of Close Encounters, without the wonder, without the newness, and without the John WIlliams score, but riddled with inconsistencies that were simply ignored by the scriptwriters.  I have no interest in ennumerating them here--there are simply too many--but I get very annoyed when I'm told that the human/alien hybrid can't use her powers again because it will kill her...then she uses her powers again and it doesn't kill her, or even weaken her.  Maybe I just need to learn to relax?

Having trashed the overall series, I do want to acknowledge some successful aspects of it.  Matt Frewer was terrific, overacting and all; he made his character the most intriguing of the series--this was brilliant casting.  Heather Donahue was good, too, as a twitchy psychopath, but her role was not as well written.  As for the writing, an occasional moment of interest appeared, and one episode featuring some anthropologists in the Pacific Northwest was particularly good--although curiously enough, not particularly connected with the main storyline.  Also, when the hybrid first demonstrates her powers in a rather magnificent display, I was delighted.  But mostly Taken is tedium.  You'd be better off with Dark Skies, or Watching Close Encounters ten times.",1104796800,6,3014,4.85518590998043
1491232,3,B00005JM39,"First what I think went really well for this mini-series:

1) What was great writing, is how over the course of this mini-series we pass through several generations of families from the mid-1940's up to 40-50 years later

2) Some characters are redeemed some are killed off, you never know who is going to live or die. Nice element of surprise.

3) Aliens! Enough said.

4) I thought everyone did a fine acting job!

5) The guy from Max Hedroom (Matt Frewer) plays a character named Chet. I think this was my favorite character who had all the best lines.

What I thought made it only good and not great...

1) Just a little too hollywoodish that each time someone's son or daughter would be the actual successor of that person's military position. I know life is about who you know but come on. If my father was a general, I'm the exact rank when the story jumps forward in time?!? I don't think so.

2) The ending was anticlimactic for me!
AND for me, it doesn't resolve the story line. Now with that said, there may never be a true resolution when you realize what has transpired and the ending definitely sets up for a Taken 2 to be made. Regardless I was still left with the slight feeling of, ""That's it?!?""

Overall: I picked these up through my library or caught it on Netflix. . .it was a while ago so I don't remember which exactly. It was an entertaining watch and one I'm glad I did watch...but not one I'd personally own.",1104451200,,1434,4.381132075471698
1491233,5,B00005JM39,"Its no real surprise what Taken is about,in case you can't guess...Its about Alien abduction. Taken is classic Space Opera...With aliens. The CGI in this film was very strong. The aliens look excellent. The space ship very cool. The story varies from episode to episode, with the first few episodes being great, and the final three being sterotypical rubbish.

The plot? Aliens make contact with earth. People are abducted for no apparent reason. Some people go crazy, others accept it, others fight back. The enigma of the aliens is slowly revealed throughout the five disc draa.

Okay, call me a bad gal, but I liked the Crawford family. Particularly Owen and his son. They had spine. The rest of the characters range from so-so to insipid. I grew really tired of the little girl, Allie, and her narrations. Oh, and her gen-x parents were also annoying. (What was with their hair? Its called a brush...Ever heard of it?)  I wanted them to get abducted. PERMANENTLY. I swear, the mom spent the final two disc's worth of episdoes whining and feeling sorry for herself. Boring.

Worth seeing, especially the first half. The second half was marred by a little too much focus on Allie. It was as if Spielberg ran out of X-files ideas and decided to do Firestarter instead. Entertaining for Sci-Fi fans everywhere...If you can forget about the ending.",1102896000,2,1347,4.843478260869565
1491234,5,B00005JM39,"Hello,

I have read quite a bit about alien abductions from the work of John E. Mack, David Jacobs, and Budd Hopkins. They are real,  the evidence is closer than we think. Taken is the best portrayal of what alien abductions are, and Spielberg has got very very close to them. I am curious to know what Spielberg think about alien abductions, because this is his third movie/production we have seen on the extraterrestrial subject. Remember Close Encounters, ET?

Maybe he is another believer, that would be fine...

If you want to know about alien abductions, I really recommend you to buy Taken, you will be surprised!

1491235,1,B00005JM39,"I will never watch another Spielberg movie again.  This was the longest, most boring, and most cliched alien abduction feature EVER!  Oh how I long for the days when ""V"" came out!

If you want to see how a good sci-fi, abduction story is supposed to be told, watch ""4400"" when the next season comes out.",1095033600,4,303,4.375
1491273,4,B00005JM39,"The DVD quality is really good: sound, picture, additional features, documentary.

The documentary does not have to much information related from where the story has been taken, I mean, reference to real events that inspire the series.  I though that it could have a documentary related UFOs, but not.

Even people does not believes in UFOs can enjoy this series.  It has suspense, intrigue, and is interesting watch how separated histories becomes together.

The last episode, ""Taken"" comes to break a few elements of the series.  ""Mary Crawford"", the grand child of ""Capt./Maj. Owen Crawford"" has a very defined personality, inflexible to rich her goal.  Her priority is the UFO topic, and she never quits her goal.  She did cold actions setting in 2nd plane her feelings.  Very happy end where the end is not needed, the story itself is good.  I felt a little angry with last episode, inconsistence in the personality of characters.  A lot of work defining personalities, consistent from my point of view, now all are changed without reason.  I know that some people likes: The good guys always win.

You can enjoy it, if you have time.

*POSSIBLE SPOILER*  Mary's partner becomes humanist, and his interest in this topic is end.  Why? About Mary, It is not logic her change to becomes passive person that will lose the gift of her grand father, the only physical evidence, and didn't do nothing trying to stop, or the militaries leaves the parents of the child girl free.",1093996800,5,1475,4.84
1491274,4,B00005JM39,"For a 15 hour movie event, TAKEN holds up surprisingly well.  Despite the participation of a different director for each of its 10 chapters, the script maintains a singleness of vision throughout the entire run.  Credit that to the lone screenwriter Les Bohem, hired originally to do the first few chapters but eventually winning the assignment to do the whole darn thing.

The special effects are spiffy though used sparingly.  The focus is, after all, on several generations of 3 families and their involvement in the repeated visits by the aliens - called the grays.

Some actors play the same character throughout their decades-long involvement in the storyline, and the aging makeup doesn't always work well.  Similarly, for characters who must be shown in drastically different growth stages, multiple actors are used to play the same character.  And almost without fail, the actors look NOTHING alike.  Not even close.  But rest assured they are all ATTRACTIVE as adults.  This is television, you know.

The earliest chapters are the most compelling.  Joel Gretsch plays Air Force Colonel Owen Crawford, and Crawford is one deliciously evil b@stard.  Gretsch steals every scene he is in, and thankfully he is in many, many of them.

The concluding chapters are the weakest, and the typical Spielberg hand of sappiness and emotional manipulativeness prevails.  I didn't even notice the now-obvious New Testament parallels of the final chapter until I read another reviewer's take on this, and it sure is a bit heavy-handed.

Worth purchasing?  Hard to say.  Definitely rent it first (each disc runs 3 hours, so be careful how many you rent at once).  Make up your mind about purchasing it after you've seen it.  This box set is so pricey I'd hate to recommend someone to buy it sight-unseen.

All in all, though, the acting is solid throughout, and the absence of A-list stars helps keep the focus on the story and the characters instead of any starpower casting.  Though many subplots and vignettes could easily have been trimmed or deleted without compromising or altering the story's integrity, the mere fact that it runs as long as it does was surely a selling point to market this miniseries as an EVENT.  It could have been shorter and perhaps even tighter and better, but one must show some measure of respect for the epic scope of this tale as told.

Impressive on most fronts, TAKEN is absolutely worth watching at least once.",1090972800,10,2441,4.941031941031941
1491275,4,B00005JM39,"The series is a power-mix of everything UFO-Alien, it borrows heavily, and sometimes just steals ideas from Close Encounters, E.T., Independence Day, X-Files, 50's sci-fi movies, history and more. But don't expect to see many  aliens, it's more about humans, and that is why it works. At first, I wasn't sure. But after the first two chaptes, I was hooked. I found a big flaw in the transition and aging of characters from chapter to chapter for two reasons, incompatible casting from child/teen to adult characters and not very convincing makeup. Also the way some key characters are eliminated from the plot is almost cartoonish. Very good performance by  Joel Gretsch as the relentless Owen Crawford, and  I found an interesting performace by Matt Freweras the sarcastical and witty Dr. Chet Wakeman. But the best is cute, little Dakota Fanning, she steals the show. I hope Spielberg has more projects in mind for her potential tallent. 3/4 of the way the series starts to deviate dangerously, but falls back on track to a rewarding ending. Overall the series is very good. Highly recommended.",1085011200,9,1096,4.978142076502732
1491276,5,B00005JM39,"Some have likened the nearly 15-hour miniseries ""Taken"" to ""Close Encounters Of The Third Kind"" meets ""The X-Files."" That's not far off the mark. In fact, it is what this reviewer thought even before reading similar sentiments elsewhere.
Featuring solid television production, good scripts, passable special effects and fantastic performances by a huge cast, ""Taken"" is a strong series chronicling 50 years of alien abduction and government conspiracies, all circling around three families. Fans of Spielberg's view on aliens and the X-Files' view on government secrecy and paranoia will likely enjoy this (though Spielberg's sweetness and light trumps the Files' jaded cynicism in the end).
All ten episodes, each 90 minutes long, tie together to form one long narrative, though many of the episodes can serve well as standalone entertainment, too. It is the characters that keep the whole affair afloat, with family being the tie that binds three generations together. Some of the middle episodes are a bit slow, and the later installments rely too heavily on cliffhangers, but all in all viewers will want to keep watching well past bedtime. I was so pulled in, I watched the whole series in just three days.
Most impressive is the cast, who turn in great performances throughout. Great makeup work ages the characters as the series moves forward, allowing us to see people live out 30-plus years of their life in a convincing fashion. Very engaging. Most impressive is the young Dakota Fanning. Pay attention to this one. She turns in a startling, deep, engaging, endearing performance.
Take note, this is not Hollywood blockbuster filmmaking. What this is, is classic TV miniseries material. The production values are not nearly on par with those of Band of Brothers. The pacing is television pacing, not movie pacing (deliberate, not action-oriented). And little is shown that could not be shown on network television. None of this works against the series, either. Rarely in these 15 hours does it fail to compel.
So do we get a dark view or light view of aliens? A bit of both, actually. We have dread and we have wonder. They are scary and they are wonderful. Questions of the aliens' intent always linger. Yes, questions are answered for those who watch all 15 hours, but other questions are left open, which is a must for a tale like this. I never felt gypped at being left with too many questions, nor did I ever feel too much was explained.
The DVD set features nice packaging and good disc quality. The last disc of extras is sparse, with a glossy bit of hype disguised as a documentary, but it's better than nothing.
So is ""Taken"" worth the steep price tag? That's a tough question to answer. For lovers of the aforementioned works, probably. You'll love the first viewing, and you'll watch it more than once. Not as dark as X-Files, nor as light as Close Encounters. For casual fans of the genre, well, a rental might be a good idea before taking the big plunge. Those looking for pure sci-fi, too, should proceed with caution; a special effects extravaganza this isn't.",1083456000,27,3086,4.902485659655832

Counting the four hours of self-flagellation for sitting through this painfully boring mini-series amounts to a whole day of my life which would have been better spent watching Close Encounters of the Third Kind twelve times. Obviously, most of the casting budget must have been spent on Dakota Fanning. With the exception of her performance, the acting was one step below a Lifetime made-for-tv melodrama. Heather Donahue was irritating enough for two hours in the Blair Witch Project but after ten hours of her self-conscious twitching and creepy bug-eyes, I was thrilled when it appeared the aliens took her. Alas, they gave her back. Matt Frewer's acting style , while being at least unique and imaginative, has the overall effect of fingernails on a chalkboard or an ice cream headache. You just want it to stop already. Why did I watch the whole twenty hours you might ask. I was hoping for an ending that would justify the money and effort put into this project and was sadly disappointed. The payoff was a simplistic and obvious religious analogy that was an insult to the intelligence of anyone over the age of six years old. They even threw in Peter's denial of knowing Jesus and the little girl's journal as the bible just in case you didn't `get it.' How dumb did they think this audience would be?

The first five episodes represent an excellent, well written, engaging mini-series that gets you hooked by the end of the first episode and makes you excited to see the next.  A soap opera of alien abduction and government cover-up with richly drawn characters and some great production values, TAKEN takes a turn after episode five into an overly melodramatic crawler that lacks many of the aforementioned good qualities.  The first half takes place between the 1940's and 80's and features some great plotlines and characterization, as well as superb fx and remarkable attenion to period detail.  The remainder takes place in present day and has many lulling moments, and very little in the inventive storytelling utilized in parts one through five.  On a whole TAKEN is pretty good and definitely worth the look at least for one viewing but keep in mind that for 14+ hours and for 100+ bucks (if you decide to purchase, I'm glad I didn't even though the DVD package is nice and sound and picture quality is really good), it's not as good as the sum of it's better parts, most of which take place early on.  All and all TAKEN does entertain, but lacks what most television mini-series lack, and that is the devotion and execution of feature films.

It gets better exponentially. If I would recommend one thing for a person to watch, it would be this series.

1491281,3,B00005JM39,"Best:
1) The story outline is very cool and has a full-circle feel. It involves 3 generations of 3 families - one victims of the aliens, one part of the aliens and one hunting the aliens.
2) The acting was good, especially that of the little girl (played by Dakota Fanning). She is possibly the best child actor I've ever seen and it's clear why she was chosen to be the centerpiece.
3) The series had a generally epic feel, showing the passing of time convincingly. (It does, however, take the first 4 episodes to really get you hooked).
4) The special-effects were often comparable to big-budget theater movies.
Worst:
1) The special features were pretty scant - a few behind-the-scenes shows that average 5-10 minutes in length. The problem with them is that they were basically self-congratulatory and provided little interesting information.
2) They didn't really take the UFO subject to a new level as promised. It ended up being a long soap opera with dashes of supernatural, like a watered-down episode of ""The X-Files"" that just goes on and on.
3) The ending and, ultimately, the meaning to the whole series ended up being ambiguous. I KNEW they were going to cop out like that and not answer any questions - and they didn't.
Recommendation:
If you pay the full retail price for this 10-hour mini-series, you'll feel like the one being ""Taken"" (couldn't resist the pun). Get it used for half-price or less if you can't rent it. Soap opera fans will probably like it, but hardcore sci-fi fans may be disappointed if they're expecting anything new.",1076284800,12,1555,4.762962962962963
1491282,3,B00005JM39,"I just finished my 15-hr investment in this sprawling multi-generational abduction epic. The series began strong - the early episodes taking us from 1944 through the late fifties were compelling. These episodes took the lore seriously, and stuck to the ""facts"" on which everyone agrees. The 15 hours starts feeling a bit excessive once we encounter the hybrids in the woods circa episode four. This entire episode feels like an overlong X-Files. The same can be said of the later episode in which the abduction support group is taken hostage.
All in all, the series takes a nosedive in episode four, recovers a little, then once we reach the present day, time is manipulated so that we feel as if we are watching a story unfold in Super Slo-Mo. Dakota Fanning is awesome as Allie. She is one adorable and talented little girl. Heather Donahue is especially annoying as the power-corrupted bitch. She has an oddness about her which is distracting, and the quivering Blair Witch nostrils make several appearances. Matt Frewer, conversely, has an oddness about him that plays just perfectly. He is very good in this. The dude who plays the adult Tom Clarke is also very good.
At some point during an alien agenda story, the writer is forced to leave the safety of the known facts and launch into theory which becomes the payoff of his story, since the real-life abduction saga offers no such thing as yet. I can't really say that writer, Leslie Boehm took the safe road, because he did offer explanations, and he did close the story. I was disappointed in the Spielberg tendency towards spectacle, especally in the grand finale. I prefer a sci fi tale which can conclude with the general populace being none the wiser. Spielberg consistantly pushes his conclusions towards the awakening of mankind to a greater consciousness, which always to me feels overblown. I recommend this series to the diehard UFO fanatic, but I doubt the casual fan should invest this much time into the epic when a nice plot synopsis would do.",1075075200,,2016,4.829479768786127
1491321,5,B00005JM39,"This is that kind of profound Sci Fi I like. I always thought that the standard film format of 90-120 minutes is not enough to present most of the themes I am interested in - like Science Fiction. The sickness of most films today is that the studios put too much action in it and let the stories and characters stay very superficial - they think thats what the crowd wants, but most people I know are critizising exactly that. (Its not the first time hollywood misunderstands viewer studies and ratings).
So, this movie serie has a lot of wonderful quiet moments. It has action too but only where it belongs to the story. Action freaks may be disappointed, this is an emotional thought-related view of the UFO mystery.
They took all the great known UFO incidents (rumors) and tried to get them into one whole story. So, who knows, its possible that this is the truth behind everything...
I see people giving bad notes about this movie mainly for two reasons that they missunderstand:
1: ""Its bad storytelling because in the end it solves nothing""
The story of this movie tries to stay nearby reality, and, folks, thats the nature of our existence that the universe is full of questions and answers that only take you to new questions. Its realism. To critisize the open questions at the end only means that the spectator misinterpreted Taken as a fantasy-film.
2: ""There is nothing new on Taken""
Taken bases on rumors that we all know. Whats new on taken is the point of view, the insight into this 3 families and theory how all the rumors may connect together. Whats not new, and can and should not be new, is all the alien stuff, of course when you try to do something ""nearby documentary"" you can not invent new stuff to it.
So I am completely happy with Taken and I enjoyed every minute watching!",1074643200,3,1800,4.541538461538462

Although the first episode, ""Beyond the Sky,"" is a bit slow moving, it sets up the foundation for an epic miniseries. The characters here are the core of the story, and you'll love (or dislike, in some cases) many of them, especially Allie, whom you hear throughout but only see for the last few episodes. It's not totally sci-fi, more like an epic drama set through 50 years of history, with sci-fi mixed throughout. In other words, even non-sci-fi fans can enjoy this great work!",1074038400,,566,4.785714285714286
1491323,3,B00005JM39,"I must commence by saying I am not a fan of science fiction (rather, I deal with much, much darker, more gothic pieces), Mr. Spielberg, or originally any of the actors in the series. Taken caught my eye for reasons I do not fully understand. What is even more confusing is that through the only moderately interesting first half of the series, I continued watching until something truly caught my eye..
There are many reviewers who have extolled the virtues of Dakota Fanning and her portrayal of Allie -- many of whom seem to be unable to remove their fingers from the exclamation point key. However, I'm certain I'm not the only one who found her irritating and a pathetic excuse for ""philosophical"". The narrative insights peppered throughout the episodes were dull and obvious to anyone who has spent longer than ten minutes thinking about philosophy. I agree that Dakota Fanning did an excellent job of acting an extremely flat character.
In fact, all of the characters seemed to be flat (I use flat as a literary term, wherein the character has only one feature that drives them). The Keys family was passionately violent, the Clarke family was empathetic and emotional, most of the Crawfords were ambitious. There was nothing in either the development or existence of the characters which has not already been cliched to death or was brutally obvious. The acting was mostly embarrassing to otherwise quite good actors. Emily Bergl, for example, who was brilliant in The Rage, spent her screen time in this piece whining about finding her daughter.
That said, there were two characters who either seem to be overlooked or spat on, and I am speaking of Mary Crawford and Chet Wakeman. Mary was one of the most complex characters I have come across in any form of media (excluding literature), and Chet was not far behind. Their relationship was an exquisite homage to the darkness of the show -- which was not as accentuated as it should have been. I am aware that many people found the age difference appalling, but this is such a minor factor in today's society that it surprises me to see most peoples' reactions.
I was even more surprised to find an aspect of Taken to appeal to my inherent dark side -- but the relationship between Chet and Mary did an astounding job of that. Entwining the two unbelievably complex characters into a romantic and yet equally complicated relationship was one of the most intelligent things done in this series.
When I watch television or movies, I watch them for the characters and the themes, connections, and meanings behind the blatant mainstream. Taken did not provide me with anything interesting to consider until Chet and Mary appeared.
Science fiction and soap opera fans who enjoy cliches will love Taken for its interestingly overdone alien abduction and familial plotlines. Those who enjoy looking a bit further beneath the surface will be pleased to find the complication and intrigue of the Crawford family, and the completely untypical relationship between Mary and Chet.",1071878400,3,3028,4.90448343079922
1491324,4,B00005JM39,"""Steven Spielberg Presents Taken"" is a 10-part maxi-series that spins a story of alien abduction and genetic experimentation out of the infamous story of the crash of a U.F.O. at Roswell, New Mexico.  Actually ""Taken"" begins at the end of World War II, when aliens first abduct B-17 bomber pilot Russell Keys (Steve Burton) and his crew during a bomb run over Germany.  For the rest of the century the life of Keys and his descendants will cross paths with two other families.  Sally Clarke (Catherine Dent) takes an alien visitor (Eric Close) into her home, and ends up bearing his child.  Eventually the grandchildren of these Russell and Sally will come together and produce the end product of the alien's breeding program.  On the other side of the equation are the Crawfords, the first generation of which is Major Owen Crawford (Joel Gretsch), who is in charge of the Air Force's program to answer the mystery of the aliens.
Major Crawford is your stereotypical warped military commander who is completely obsessed by his project.  The nicest thing you can say about him is that he is not a sadistic bully, just a murdering bully.  No wonder General Hammond on ""Stargate SG-1"" is such a breath of fresh air.  In Crawford's case it is nurture and not nature that warps his two sons and granddaughter and has them following in the family business.  Basically the plot is a chess game between Crawford, the Air Force, and his scientists versus the aliens, in which the humans are almost always a step behind and a day late, whether they are trying to understand what the aliens are doing or trying to step the visitors from making the next move.
For most of ""Taken"" the audience knows little more than any of the characters.  Even being privy to both sides provides little help.  Actually the most important thing to pick up on during the first half of the series is the voice of the young girl doing the voice over narration in these episodes.  That is because the payoff for this story is young Allison Clarke and it is not until young Dakota Fanning appears on screen that ""Taken"" really gets off the ground.  Before that part the most interesting character is Owen Crawford, who is not a pleasant person.
Of course, this is the exact opposite of so many science fiction stories, where the set ups are great but the payoffs extremely unsatisfying.  That is not the problem here, and if you have to struggle through the first half of ""Taken"" to get to this little girl, then make yourself do it.  The result gets what would have been a mediocre science fiction series up to the level of being a good one.  There really is not a big payoff in terms of the end of the story, either in terms of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" or ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" it all comes down to the little girl.
With her alien genetic background and what we have already seen some of her ancestors do when they were kids, you know that little Allie is going to be able to do some astounding things.  But the most impressive thing she does is talk to others.  People like to talk to her, she observes at one point, and for most of her time in ""Taken"" Allie looks like a cute little girl but also projects a calmness and sense of wisdom that are quite captivating.  My favorite scenes are when she suddenly turns to an adult and says a sentence of such penetrating insight that it blows you away.
Maybe I am making too much of this.  Given how low the bar is set in ""Taken"" it might be relatively easy for an 8-year-old to dazzle us.  But given the resume Dakota Fanning has put together in this half of her life (""I Am Sam,"" ""Sweet Home Alabama,"" and ""The Cat in the Hat""), I am pretty sure she is pretty good.  All I really know is that once she showed up I really started paying attention to ""Taken.""",1070928000,5,3784,4.469476744186046
1491325,5,B00005JM39,"I just saw the last two episodes of Taken last night. I bought it on DVD after seeing parts on it on TV and being highly intrigued. It also gave me the chance to see some actors/actresses in non-familar roles: Adam Kaufman and Julie Benz from BtVS, Ryan Merriman from the Pretender, and Chad Donella from an episode of Smallville. Also, seeing Steven Spielberg do a TV mini-series was neat. If you haven't seen it, I can't reccomend it highly enough.
A quick summary:
Taken follows three families who are involved in alien abductions over the course of approximately 55-60 years. One family  repeatedly abducted, one family with alien blood in their veins, and one family involved in hunting aliens. It culminates in a not totally unexpected, but still emotional final scene.

Extradordinary writing, impressive special effects, and mostly strong performances from a cast of relative unknows. The best performances come from the adorable Dakota Fanning. This little girl gives a heartfelt, and moving performance as Allie Keys. Emily Bergl (Carrie 2: The Rage) also gives a strong, emotional peformance as Allie mother. Other noteworthy performances come from Adam Kaufman as Charlie and Joel Gretsh as Owen Crawford. There are a few things that bothered me which is why I gave it only 4 stars. Heather Donahue(Blair Witch Project girl) is absolutley atrocious, and she almost made me fast forward her scenes. Unbearable. Matt Frewer is also terrible, and way over the top, and his comedic skills are way out of place.

1491372,4,B00005JM39,"While I agree that some of this series does indeed drag on unnecessarily, I disagree on a good number of points.  ""Drama,"" as some have wrongly labeled as a detriment to storytelling, is the very core of any strong narrative.  TAKEN delivers on that account.  It never pretended to be anything else than (and I use this now ubiquitous term only because it actually applies here) a humanized epic. It IS a true epic: the prolonged story of many characters over a vast landscape that attempt to overcome multiple conflicts underlined by a recurrent thematic unity.
For those who want interaction between extraterrestrials and human I might suggest watching other bubble-gum fictions.  The aliens are inconsequential in the true story of TAKEN.  As I see it, the real narrative lies in how three separate families deal with the turmoil of their inexorably intertwined lives and the tumultuous results of their actions.
To that end, the filmmakers have done a credible job of melding elements from THE KENTUCKY CYCLE, THE ODYSSEY, THE X-FILES and countless other familiar works to create an insightful and entertaining mini-series.  While I will agree that some of the episodes in the later part of the series do stray some, they do have their place in the story and reinforce the thematic elements being explored.
Nevertheless, this tendency run aground of an otherwise sound course prevents me from giving my highest accolades and can only summon 4 stars.  Don't get me wrong; I firmly believe that TAKEN fully deserved the awards it received and I look forward to repeated viewings and delving further into what the filmmakers are saying.",1068681600,,1637,4.9963235294117645

1491378,5,B00005JM39,"Steven Spielberg, best known for movies like E.T. and Jaws, delivers a tour-de-force epic on a scale few ""made-for-T.V."" movies have ever reached.  Taken, a mini-series originally developed for Sci-Fi, is a multi-generation story of three families, and their experiences with other-worldly beings.  The story begins during World War II and continues up to present day, elaborately exploring the lives of people who have been abducted and others who would cover up such knowledge.
The story is broken up into 10 episodes:
1.) ""Beyond the Sky"", set in 1947, the first episode introduces the audience to three families whose lives will be forever changed by alien abduction, goverment cover-ups, and a series of events is put into motion that will effect future generations of these families for years to come.
2.) ""Jacob and Jesse"", set in the early 50's, these two boys are introduced to the series.  Jacob, a boy who is half alien/half human, is sought out by the military for his unique abilities.  Jesse, the son of an abductee is taken for the first time.
3.) ""High Hopes"", set in the late 50's, the story continues with Owen Crawford, top officer behind the military's investigation into the U.F.O phenomenon, attempts to capture Jacob, and fails.  Later, he is approached by Jesse Keys and discovers that both Jesse and his father have an alien implant in their brain.
4.) ""Acid Test"" Owen's sons learn of their father's involvement with the military cover up of extra-terrestrial contact when they discover the remains of the crashed ship in a safe within the father's office.
5.) ""Maintenance""  Eric Crawford takes over his father's work when Owen dies suddenly of a heart attack.  He continues his father's search for Jacob Clarke and Jesse Keys, the latter of whom disappeared from inside a military bunker during one of his abduction incidents.
6.) ""Charlie and Lisa"" Charlie, the son of Jesse, and Lisa, daughter of Jacob, are brought together by their alien abductors, and Lisa conceives a child, a little girl with extraordinary powers.
7.) ""God's Equation"" Charlie and Lisa learn about their daughter Allie's powers while trapped in a dangerous situation.  Mary Crawford, grand-daughter of Owen Crawford, learns of the little girl and begins to make plans to take her.
8.) ""Dropping the Dishes"" General Bears kidnaps Allie in an attempt to lure the aliens to him.  Realizing that Allie is an alien/human hybrid, and knowing that the aliens protect their own, he beleives they will come for her.
9.) ""John"" Charlie and Lisa conspire to save Allie from the military, and in so-doing, they learn of their daughter's immense and amazing powers.
10.) ""Taken""  Allie learns who she really is-an alien/human hybrid, and she is forced to make the most difficult decision of her life, a choice that will forever change her life and that of her family.
The series combines state-of-the-art special effects with a story that is both compelling, entertaining, and high spirited.  Such a major undertaking might not have worked even 10 years ago, but with the use of computer animation, the fantastic world of ""Taken"" is brought beautifully to life.
The story plays a little like an elaborate X-Files Episode, and not without good cause....the material is certainly similar.  However, it is treated with a level of intelligence that really captures the imagination of the audience.  Taken won the 2003 Emmy for best mini-series, an accomplishment well earned by the cast and crew of this enjoyable and massive film.",1067904000,193,3516,5.041379310344827
1491379,1,B00005JM39,"I love stories that span generations.  It provides so much opportunity to evolve the characters and the plot.  With 15 hours (ten 90 minute episodes roughly) to tell the story, I had high hopes of a truly epic and meaningful story.  Taken was neither epic nor meaningful.  Every episode, I kept waiting for something to move the plot forward, or change the characters in some significant way (these are the precepts of good story telling, that and a challenge to overcome).  At the end of most episodes, I came away feeling disappointed.  There was no plot.  Everyone was a victim or a bad guy.  No heros, no one to root for, no one you could feel good about.  The challenge in this story was for the abductees to stay out of the clutches of the ""evil government organization"", and for everyone to try and figure out what the aliens were up to.  Normally, you expect the hero to prevail.  But, there was no hero, and nobody prevailed.  In fact, everyone's situation just got worse.  Several characters were victims of their own evil ways, and the rest were just victims.  In this respect, Taken is a tragedy, and the only light at the end of 50 years of people doing bad things to each other is the little girl who finally explains what it's all about.  A barely profound 10 minutes of revelation after 15 hours of poor setup for such a simple climax.  It might have worked if they forced themselves to tell the story in 3-4 hours.  At least then, you could get the same experience without having to wade through so much otherwise useless drama.
I suppose seeing the totally disparate reviews on Taken (here and elsewhere) just points out how many different perspectives there are for good story telling and good sci-fi.  I guess I should accept that for many people, alien abduction stories, no matter how badly produced, are always a hit.  For such people, Taken provides 15 hours of what you probably like most.  A few people have likened Taken to a soap opera.  Perhaps that's the appeal I'm missing as well.  If you want 15 hours of an alien oriented ""Days of Our Lives.""  Buy the DVD.  If you want good story telling, with interesting characters that evolve, a plot that moves and something you'll likely watch again and again, don't buy Taken.  In my opinion, this mini-series should have been called ""Took.""  That's how I felt after seeing it on TV.  Especially considering what the SciFi channel canceled in order to push this mini series on us.
If you must, catch it on the SciFi channel the next time it comes around.  With so many other excellent choices on DVD, don't waste your money to buy Taken.",1067817600,28,2611,4.568965517241379

1491410,3,B00005JM39,"What a great idea - present all the UFOlogy in a quasi-documentary epic tale of three  generations of families that have encounters with aliens.  As a fan of both relationship dramas and sci-fi, I was excited by the meeting of these two genres.  It's astounding that the combination of this great starting point and Spielberg's influence produced such mediocre material.  Overall, if the show is watched in moderation, you may be entertained - a decent story with many plots, lots of aliens and UFOs, good acting (with a few exceptions), and just enough soap-opera drama to keep you coming back.  However, most of the series is surprisingly not engaging and represents everything I abhor about typical TV miniseries - way too much ambition with such low quality writing and directing, slow pacing compensating for a lack of interesting dialogue and plot development, very standard visual style and music (I thought the selection of pop songs in a few of the eps was very poor and misplaced), overuse of narration, and a high dull-to-interesting character ratio. Much of the dialogue is stilted, there is no comic relief, and anytime the show attempts to be `gritty' with a scene of violence, it is over-the-top and out of place.
 Each episode in the first half (the best half) of the series typically cuts quickly between 3 or 4 stories, which helps to keep the pace of a such a long episode moving, and each episode focuses on new stories and characters. Few of the characters/actors are interesting enough to want to watch them for more that a couple of episodes, so the short screen time for each generation's story serves to compensate for average writing.  And when an episode does stumble onto a great character, they are often not given enough screen time and I found myself bored by the other subplots.  Sally Clarke, the young Jacob Clarke, and the older Jesse Keys were easily some of the best characters and performances, but their stories were only given treatment in at most two episodes.
In contrast to the first 6 eps, the last four episodes focus on the same generation of characters and the same story line. The average writing, one-dimensional characters, and occasionally sub-par acting is very obvious when so much time (6 hours!) is spent on one story.  Also, within each episode the writers chose to focus on just a few events, which means that in order for the story to be engaging the dialogue and character development should be top-notch.  However, these episodes are very plodding, especially the hostage scene and much of the North Dakota story.  The series would be much better if every ep was trimmed to an hour or less.
This is a series that was trying to work on many levels - there's the alien and conspiracy story, the relationships of people and generations, the themes of fear, denial, balance of emotion and reason, importance of family and home, etc.  It would have worked so much better if subtlety was used, but instead the little girl Allie is always narrating and explaining the themes and telling us what a character is feeling.  This narration is very intrusive; it might have been okay if it were only bookending each episode, but it is used at the most awkward times.  There is no allowance for ambiguity of interpretation, all motivations are explained;  do the writers think we are stupid?  Most of the fun of watching a story is from trying to understand why characters do what they do.
I applaud the creators for the great idea - the results had the framework for a truly amazing series.  It's very disappointing that it did not work better.",1067731200,18,3591,4.784789644012945

Spielberg and Bohem (the series' writer) have outdone themseves.  If you are looking for a thinking person's science fiction show, something more thought-provoking and thought-requiring than the average sci-fi action show, Taken is for you.  I only wish it were continuing, because this is the kind of quality program I don't want to see end.
The visual effects are also of impressive quality, movie-standard or close and much better than I have come to expect from any miniseries and most TV shows.  The acting is another place where Taken shines.  Every actor does an impressive job with some very complex and in some cases otherworldly characters.  Worthy of special note is Dakota Fanning's portrayal of Allie Keys.  It's rare to find any actor who can convey so much with such a nonphysical role; Allie rarely does anything more physical than walking, most of what she does is either psychic in nature or simply emitting wonderfully scripted and delivered dialogue.  To find this ability in an actor who is young enough to play a nine year old character - and therefore has not had time to build up a large amount of experience - is truly incredible.

1491417,5,B00005JM39,"By far the most comprehensive and persuasive Sci-Fi ""historical fiction"" ever produced in a mini-series format.
The storyline is extremely tight and compeling and rich with deep characters.
The multi-generational spanning of family characters inter-twined with the mysterious undercurrent of the alien abductions and the shadowy (MAJIC-12, Air Force, etc.) government figures pursuing them both, make a sort triangulating crossfire of suspense!
The sinister air intelligence officer, Owen Crawford, is a malevolent but attractive character in the same way Star Wars fans gravitate to the charisma of Darth Vader; an evil character but not totally of his accord - driven to his acts of cruelty and coldness by an uncontrollable obseesion to discover the secrets of the alien presence.
His offspring, one son following in his father's oversized footsteps and the other diverging from this path both meet their fate in the shadow of the alien conspiracy but at different ends of the spectrum.
It is the granddaughter of Owen Crawford who is the true prodigy that continues her grandfather's work with the same obsessive zeal and malevolence to the point of madness.
On the other side of the story is the family plagued and pursued by the Crawford legacy for as many generations.
A family that not only has intimate knowledge of the alien presence and the continued visits and abductions but has a ""bloodline"" connection dating back to the Roswell Incident 1947 that creates successive generations of hybrids that have gifted abilities.
It is this that the Crawfords and the other gov't ""spooks"" want most.  To capture these children and later adults that possess this secret inside.
The third element being the aliens themselves are constantly confounding the govenment entities while plaguing the family's of abductees for generations.
The richly developed story twists and blends to contrast and compare all these characters throughout the production and climaxes with the collision of of all three forces truly bringing into understanding the meaning of its title name ""Taken"".

Not that we believe (or we do) in abductions, UFO's etc. but in this case there is actually a story behind everything - and a compelling one. If you expect laser blasters and space fights you are in for a big disappointment, but let this not deter you from watching Taken. It is done very intelligently. The fiction parts are used to glue various pieces of UFO/abductions information/rumor that has been circulating since the forties.
The blend is very believable.

Essentially, this is soap opera mixed with Spielberg suburban feel-good morality using the alien angle and government cover-up as a pure plot vehicle and nothing more. As with most Spielberg works, it is long on production values and short on depth or profundity.
It does keep your viewing attention, but only in the ""what will happen next to him/her"" sense of soap operas. By all means, sit back and enjoy, but don't expect much of substance from this series.

1491474,5,B00005JM39,"Hi everybody 'out there',
I hardly watch series on television. Still, for a period of ten weeks the Steven Spielberg-event 'Taken' -broadcasted on BBC 2- got me hooked! The topic of 'alien abduction' might be a very tricky one, but fact and fiction were handled satisfactory. The idea to depart from a well known historical event -the Roswell case in 1947- and to relate this to the story of three families, spanning more than three generations and more than 50 years of American history, is simply great. As I watched the series I saw the unfolding of a fascinating beautiful story (with several milestones of history looming in the background) while at the same time I could easily relate to the three portrayed families, as if I was watching my favourite soap opera. It was good drama, offering not only fascinating weird stuff and people (alien abductions, spacecrafts, genetic engineering, mad scientists, the obsessive nature of the Crawford family), but also the joy and the burden that goes well with relationships: love, friendship, romance, betrayal and adultery.
The characters were a real treat. Very entertaining! And who could expect otherwise? A plot dealing with alien abduction will always invite some weirdo's to arrive on the scene sooner or later.
Script-writer Leslie Bohem did a great job. I think we owe it much to Bohem's contribution that 'Taken' is a compelling, fascinating, coherent and consistent fifteen hour television show. An immense effort! Also much praise for Dakota Fanning's fantastic and sometimes deeply moving performance. In the last four episodes she plays the bright, intelligent 9 year old girl Allie Keys. She was absolutely brilliant!
Throughout the story Allie also appears in a 'narrative role', reading her thoughts from her diary, pondering on the ""how's"" and ""why's"" of daily behaviours and human fate. I liked her comments on 'human endeavours'. This 'narrative element' -handled with care by Leslie Bohem- worked really fine for me.
As her name 'Allie Keys' already suggests, Allie is the strange key figure of the drama. Although Allie looks and acts 'human' in every way, she has a unique genetic makeup: she's a mixture of human and alien DNA. This mix of DNA makes her more than the sum of its parts: it endows her with superhuman powers. She can manipulate time and she can manifest thought, among other things. For the aliens she becomes 'an unqualified success', representing the next step in their evolution. In order to create someone like Allie, abducting and researching people was necessary. Achieving this goal seems to be their number one priority and they don't seem to care much about the 'collateral damage' they inflict on their human victims for many decades. Three successive generations of the Crawford family -in charge of a secret USA-government/army-project concerning alien abductions- are unceasingly trying to understand the aliens' intentions.
In the end the aliens' experiment turns out to be very meaningful for humankind as well. Allie's innate goodness as well as the use of her powers for the benefit of people around her transforms those people's lifes. In this regard Allie shows characteristics of a messianic figure. Like almost all messianic figures Allie passes through a severe crisis, a period of retreat -in this case a coma that blocks her off from normal human conditions and surroundings- before she can face up her new mission and destiny. People that have been 'touched' by her 'good works' will eventually gather and become her followers/admirers before she 'takes off'. The last two episodes manifest strong religious elements. A lot of events seem to refer to the biblical New Testament. Let me name a few:
*the 'supernatural' way -via alien, non-human intervention- in which Allie is conceived, resembling the 'divine intervention' prior to the birth of Christ
*the alien John -Allie's great-grandfather- comes as a 'messenger', reminding Allie of her destiny, as -likewise- John the Baptist did for Christ
*Allie's uncle Tom Clarke becomes a 'believer' after years of disbelief and scepticism towards alien abduction. In a way Tom resembles the apostle Thomas who eventually becomes a believer in the message of Christ
*before she leaves, Allie frees her followers-admirers of tracking devices put in their heads by aliens, devices that have ruined most of their lives. In this scene Allie's admirers bleed out of their noses, as if they all in fact spill their blood for Allie... a variation on Jesus' Last Supper with his Apostles?
*there's the betrayal-denial of Allie after she has left with the aliens: when interrogated by a soldier, one of Allie's most fervent admirers -a man whose life was transformed by her- denies that he knew her, just like the apostle Peter denied Christ in a very similar situation
*after Allie has left with the aliens her mother Lisa is convinced that her daughter will return to Earth again, just like Christ is believed to do so (or do Lisa's words here only refer to the possibility of a sequel of 'Taken'?)
*the close of the last episode shows 'believer' Tom Clarke handing over Allie's diary to her mother Lisa, the book with Allie's thoughts on humanity. To me this seemed like referring to 'the Gospel of Allie' that's left behind for the benefit of mankind
I don't have a clear opinion about alien abductions (How could I? So far, I've never been abducted), but I do believe there's more out there beyond the sky. The universe with its billions of stars is simply too big to have only room for us. But we'll probably never find out about this. What really matters is to keep in mind Allie's 'last thoughts' at the close of the final episode: it's more important to keep asking questions than knowing all the answers. While I am writing this, the dvd-box has not been released yet, but I already look forward to give 'Taken' a re-run on my dvd-player.",1048636800,30,5898,5.001017293997966

Credit Leslie Bohem for a tightly written and consistently engrossing script.
The cast of Taken is superb, so much so that I would hate to leave anyone out.  But I will mention the standouts.  Dakota Fanning is marvelous as Allie Keys, a bright and intelligent little girl with an ambiguous future.  Joel Gretsch is riveting as Owen Crawford, one of the ""villains"" of the piece, his performance is so hypnotic his successors (son and granddaughter) are rather disappointing in comparison.  The film's weakest performances definitely belong to Heather Donahue and Matt Frewer, the former of who is just awful and the latter is actually quite amusing, but doesn't feel like he belongs in this epic tale.
The special effects are excellent and the story twists and turns with remarkably coherent and extremely enjoyable results.
