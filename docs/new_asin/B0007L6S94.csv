2217074,5,B0007L6S94,OMG I wouldn't put it against them if they made every single Black Stallion Book (Including the Island Stallion) into a movie. I wil post another when I see it. Which'll be soon.,1103587200,,178,4.424242424242424
2217075,5,B0007L6S94,"I was completely entranced with ""The Black Stallion"", and when the story was continued, I became an avid fan of Walter Farley.  Back then I simply borrowed the books from the library, as we could not find them at a reasonable cost.  Then along came scholatic's in-school programs, and I actually owned what was being put out in print.

As a young country girl with a Welsh pony I roamed the vineyards and nearby Lake Erie shoreline, pretending to be saved by Molly, as Alex was by The Black.  Mr Farley gave new realms to my imagination; when I was not working or at school, I was either ahorse or with my nose in a book about horses!

I trained Molly as Alex trained The Black, only on a far tamer scale.  If I had known then that a *girl* could do these things, my imagination would have soared even more than it already was!

I am older now, but still love the books, and this movie brings even more life to The Black, enriches his history, and brings this grandmother back to her horse days.

This was quite well done, and a tribute to Mr Walter Farley, as well as his son.

None of our children had the passion for horses I did, perhaps our grandchildren may, but until then, it is great movies like this that show the rest of my family my young imagination, and the young girl I am inside.

Well done.  Very well done!",1102377600,14,1324,4.27710843373494
2217076,5,B0007L6S94,"I went to go see this movie with my friend and we loved it. The story was great and so was the background music. I love all horse movies, but this has to be one of the best I've ever seen. It starts ou when the Black Stallion (Sheton) is a wild foal living with his mother. Then he gets captured by a girl and she raises him and enters him in a race of Arabians (Arabian is the name of the breed Sheton is). You'll have to watch it to figure out everything that happens in between and inthe end. But if you love horses and action, this is the perfect movie for you.

And if you want to see other movies, there's Seabiscuit, The Black Stallion,Back Beauty, and plenty more.

This is a calmin yet excitble movie full of thrills and some danger, and the bond between people and horses.",1097107200,11,782,4.1381578947368425

2217099,4,B0007L6S94,"Though rather startlingly short, this Disney prequel to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Adventures-of-the-Black-Stallion-The-Ultimate-Collection/dp/B001F8KOGQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Adventures of the Black Stallion: The Ultimate Collection</a>&nbsp;is still an exciting story of the courage of a young girl and her love for a beautiful horse.  Young Neera (Biana Tamimi) is about 12 or 13 in 1947 when, after having been sent out of the country for safety during World War II, she sets out with a caravan of traders to return to her grandfather's home in the North African desert.  Separated from the traders when the company is attacked by the local bandit chief Mansoor (Ali al Ameri), she loses her camel, then her way, before meeting a wild-running yearling black horse whose presence inspires her to keep going.  Finally finding her way to her family's oasis home, she's devastated to learn that only her grandfather Ben Ishak (Richard Romanus) and her young friend Aden (Patrick Elias) are still living there, and that the family's horses were sold out of necessity during the war.  But the black colt, whom she believes to be the offspring of one of them, offers a way to rebuild the family fortunes: if she can train him for the annual race at which everyone stakes their best mares and winner takes all, she and Grandfather can become breeders again.  Ben Ishak isn't very supportive, but Aden plunges in to help, and when the day of the great fair comes, there's Neera, swathed in desert robes, ready to ride her Shitan to victory.

Besides the beautiful Arabian horses and the starkly fascinating desert landscape (the exteriors were filmed, surprisingly, in Namibia and South Africa), probably the best part of the movie is the race sequence, which, with its rugged course and the motif of girl-jockey-disguised-as-boy, will remind many viewers of the classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/National-Velvet/dp/B00004RFHN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">National Velvet</a>.  And the bond between the Black and Neera foreshadows that which will later grow between the horse and young Alec Ramsay, making the latter seem more plausible.  An enjoyable family film that may spark some discussion about obedience vs. resolve, and will be a special favorite with horse-loving girls who may have felt a bit cheated that Walter Farley's jockey wasn't female.",1263772800,,2456,5.728021978021978

2217101,1,B0007L6S94,"My family rented this movie shortly after it's DVD release a few years ago, and let me just say that's fifty minutes of my life I wish I hadn't wasted on this ""movie"". For starters, it was way too short, the acting was dull and even painful to watch at times. But my biggest complaint; THIS IT A DISGRACE TO THE BLACK STALLION AND WALTER FARLEY!!!
The Young Black Stallion was one of the first horse books I ever read and the one that got me hooked on horses, particularily the Arabian breed. And with my fond memories of the book, this so-called film adaption was just sad to watch. Does Disney really expect us to believe that a Fresian could sire a purebred Arabian? Interesting thought, don't you think?
I think Walter Farley would be greatly displeased with this, how dare Steven Farley let Disney butcher his father's creation! Granted, Steven has done a pretty good job of destroying Walter Farley's Black Stallion himself, Young Black Stallion series, The Black Stallion's Shadow, and The Black Stallion's Steeplechaser were all horrible. Aside from all that, with this movie it was like they just stole the Young Black Stallion title, because not a single part of this movie implicated the book.

I have nothing against a teenaged girl taming a wild stallion, I am after all a teenaged girl, but that's not what happened, Alec tamed the Black. And in the book this movie is supposedly based on, the man Rashid, did not tame, break, and certainly did not train the Black. In fact he was a camel herder who know nothing about horses. The book was also certainly more violent, and I'm not saying the movie should have been more violent, but it's too clean cut for The Black Stalion, and far too clean for the harshness of the Middle East. The Arabic people would actually start whole wars if one Arabian horse were stolen. I don't think anyone should waste their time buying or renting this movie, if you want a good Black Stallion movie, get the orginal Black Stallion, or even the sequel, The Black Stallion Returns, or better yet, read the books.",1248393600,2,2055,4.63013698630137
2217102,4,B0007L6S94,"When this first came out, I couldn't wait to watch it.  As a young girl I loved the Walter Farley series on The Black Stallion.

2217105,1,B0007L6S94,"Although the scenery is nice, I am sorely disappointed in both acting and content.  It was as tho' I was watching a middle school production with forced acting.  Also, the story has little build up in anticipation of it climax.  You just get started watching and the movie is over.  Literally.  I do not recommend this movie.
I have read most of Walter Farley's books, this movie does not do his stories justice.",1181779200,,412,4.589041095890411
2217106,5,B0007L6S94,"When my children were growing up, they loved the books in Walter Farley's Black Stallion series. They also loved the original movie. So, when I saw The Black Stallion, the Early Years, I got it and watched it with my granddaughter, then 7. She loved it. In fact, we watched it many times. It probably isn't a great film for adults, but for adolescents, especially girls, it's just fine. My granddaughter loved it because it's about a girl who was in a difficult spot (in the desert without food, water, or transportation), who bonded with a beautiful horse, and who rode the horse in a race that restored her family's wealth. So an adolescent girl gets to be a hero -- truly an excellent message for girls growing up.",1175126400,3,717,4.565891472868217
2217107,1,B0007L6S94,"I'm all for movies that are based on books, I feel it encourages more people to read. Yes, there are those who don't even know there is a BOOK (*gasp*) but hey, I'm used to less than observant people. I'm also one that understands that the movies will frequently be a little different from the books because of time constraints. But, this is INSANE. Fifty minutes isn't a time constraint, it's a death wish. And where does the book show up in this? There's a black horse in both, wow. >_< There may be more than that, but I couldn't finish watching, sorry.",1174694400,,556,4.407766990291262
2217108,5,B0007L6S94,"Paid $$$$ and travelled two hours one way to see this when it came out at IMAX - can't praise it enough for content, scenery and characters - just one of those family/horselover movies that takeover your heart!",1166227200,4,210,4.552631578947368
2217109,3,B0007L6S94,"""The Black Stallion"" was a brilliantly filmed movie that combined fantastic cinematography with excellent acting and a wonderful script.  ""Young Black Stallion"" was created for Imax, and the cinematography shows that the movie was set up for being shown in a huge, oversized format.  I suspect that this movie was quite a wonder in Imax.  On a television screen, even a large television screen, the movie fares poorly.

Neera is traveling in a caravan across north Africa with her grandfather when their caravan is attacked.  Neera escapes, but falls from her camel.  After wandering a while, Neera encounters a beautiful black stallion (what a shock!).  Eventually Neera makes friends with the black stallion, the black stallion rescues her, she enters a horse race, and there is a climatic end to the movie.

The problem with this movie is that it is a retread.  Take the plot of ""The Black Stallion,"" ""The Black Stallion Returns,"" and ""Hidalgo,""  remove most of the story and substitute panoramic views of scenery, since this movie was made for Imax, add in weak acting, and you have ""Young Black Stallion.""  While there is nothing wrong with this movie, there is little to commend it.  This movie is relatively expensive, and the movie is too short to justify the price.  Indeed, the extras are longer than the movie.

This movie is okay for most family members, but I suspect that most family members will generally be bored until the end, which is predictably exciting.  The horses may fascinate younger girls, but older girls will find the weak acting embarrassing.  Boys will just be puzzled as to why anyone would watch this movie.  I recommend this movie to fans who wish to collect all the Black Stallion movies ever made.  Everyone else should keep watching ""The Black Stallion"" and possibly ""The Black Stallion Returns,"" unless you have your own Imax theater.

Good luck!",1158278400,5,1884,4.923809523809524

2217111,2,B0007L6S94,"This movie is a classic example of marriage between fancy camara work/good music and scenery, and LOUSY acting/plot. Exciting horse race at end is the only redeeming quality . . . and even THAT is pretty predictable.",1155081600,,216,4.864864864864865
2217112,3,B0007L6S94,"It was ok I guess.  I'm a big time horse lover and grew up with the original classic ""The Black Stallion"".  As a child it permeated every thought I had, and now as an adult I'm still slightly obsessed and even have my own black arabian horse.  Given the history of horse movies in general I kind of expected it to be mediocre, and it didn't fail me there.  Its creators made one of the classic mistakes that all makers of horse movies seem to keep repeating, and that is to underestimate its target audience.  Yes, horse lovers usually do know something about horses.  If you are going to make a movie about them it would help to learn something about them too.  As beautiful as the friesian was, there is no way I'm going to believe that horse was the parent of an arabian.  Yes we can tell the difference.

The acting was mediocre, and I'm being generous.  The story was mediocre and very short.  Despite those flaws I still think that it would be a good movie for young children.  They won't notice those shortcomings until they get older.

The only reason I wasn't completely disappointed in this movie is because I watched it hoping for some eye candy and I got it.  Quite a lot actually.  If you are a serious horse lover it is worth watching just for all the slow motion running horse shots.  Fantastic.  The scenery isn't half bad either.  I wouldn't go quite so far as to recommend you purchase it, but if you are willing to spend 5 bucks renting for the visuals I would definately say it was worth it.  But only if you love horses.

If you want to see a really good movie buy the original movie instead.  It has a couple of shortcomings of its own... namely that there is no way on earth the jockey club is going to let an unpapered arab run.  But still, it was referred to as the greatest children's movie ever made and I would have to agree.  The original is a true classic.  Buy that instead.

All in all, I say ""meh"" for the Young Black Stallion.",1148342400,3,1960,4.2896174863387975

I thought that the ""movie"" was too short then and I continue to hold my opinion. The film comes across as a low-budget made-for-tv movie due to its shortness in length and unremarkable plot. I would have liked to see a variety in the scenery and an increase in the action or acted emotions from the actors. Disney has a great idea of making a horse movie with a female lead but this script wasn't quite it. I'd wait until the price drops to around $8 before purchasing this film.",1133308800,,585,4.2792792792792795

The magical fable of young Black's parents meeting is filmed as an extensive prologue before the titles roll, and it's as lovely as anything you'll see.  The Arabian girl Neera finds and befriends the colt while she is lost in the desert, and he becomes as special to her as any horse ever was to a girl.

For my 7-year-old daughter, this is a perfect movie.  It's just under an hour in length, starring several beautiful horses and with a preteen girl as the primary human star.  She absolutely loves it; repeated viewing required.

For the adult, well, the scenery and the horses are spectacular.  The story?  Strictly formula, predictable, and thin; thus some of the scenes of horses running in the desert go on and on and on, because they are the strength of this film.  For my tastes this is a three-star movie; for my daughter, and girls like her who love horses, it's a solid five.",1124064000,11,1007,4.612359550561798

The girl assumes a skilled role in training her friend, and she wins the race. It is predictable, certainly, but girl viewers can identify with the hero, who is finally not a boy, and who, more importantly, gains respect from grown men for her efforts.",1113091200,,529,4.813186813186813

I'll tell you the race scene is one of the most exciting and authentic I've ever experienced.  You feel like you're a part of the race.  There were no stand-ins as far as The Black was concerned.  He ran like the wind over dangerous terrain in Africa.

The only problem I have with this story is that in the desert scenes with Neera, I wonder what these two ate or drank while crossing the unforgiving sands?  Then again, it's a fantasy story directed toward children.

For those who may not know about the horse who starred in the movie, his name is Thee Cyclone and he is a purebred Egyptian Arabian stallion.  He was actually dyed ""black"" for the movie as in reality, he was a bay (medium brown with black mane and tail and legs).  Sadly, this horse passed away late last year--a real tragic loss to his owner.

When 'Black' the name the girl's given her horse at first, gets Neera back home, he runs away.  Neera is left to explain the stallion to her grandfather, who believes the horse was a dream the desert gave her.  Their once-rich family is now poor.  The stables of Arabians they had have all been sold off for food, save for one favored mare, ""Gina"" who the grandfather returned to the desert from whence she came.

A year later, the stallion returns to Neera.  They partner up again for a winner-take-all-high stakes race that will regain their family's fortune.

I wish the story was longer.  It's not as complete as the Farley novel and I can't help but feel that more footage was needed to properly tell the story.  Other than that, a beautiful film and one to keep for all who love horses and nature.",1106352000,25,1069,4.453608247422681
2217123,3,B0007L6S94,"Maybe it's somewhere in the contract: ""Before you can film a Black Stallion movie, you must first hire a child actor who cannot act."" Kelly Reno, who starred in 1979's The Black Stallion (and its sequel a couple of years later), could just barely outperform a cigar store Indian. Biana Tamimi, who plays the Black Stallion's first owner in this 2003 prequel, is a notch or two above Reno and the carved Indian... but not much. Still, she is a likeable enough little girl and she is an expert rider so I'll lay off on the criticism.

It would be easy to sit back and criticize the whole movie - it is somewhat boring - but that would be a pot-shot. Young Black Stallion was originally made to be seen on the IMAX screen and is really meant to be a visual treat, with a little story to go along. On the immense IMAX screen, close ups of actors don't work like they normally do and traditional editing and M-TV style cuts would only result in massive migraines. That is why the format has heretofore only been used for documentary-style films - at just about an hour long, Young Black Stallion is the first dramatic feature made specifically for the giant screen. Playing in DVD format on our small TV screens it feels more like a stage play, where everything is seen all at once.

With animal-movie guru Simon Wincer directing - Wincer has brought us Phar Lap, Free Willy, and Murder She Purred to name just a few - the equine stars are filmed to gleaming perfection. Horse lovers, especially fans of the purebred desert Arabian, will swoon. Aficionados of natural landscapes, especially those interested in seeing the Namibian desert in all its vast glory, will be breathless. People who like a rousing horse race and ""nice story"" will probably be satisfied enough with Young Black Stallion.

The original producer of the first two Black Stallion movies has returned for this version. It does have some of the look and feel of the first two films, making it a welcome addition for diehard fans of The Black... but for fans of the complex and emotional tales that author Walter Farley wove, this prequel lacks a lot. It's not a bad movie by any means; it's just not a great one.

The DVD allows the viewer several choices. To augment the short running time of the film an all-new 15 minute prequel, ""The Sire"" is an option. You can also choose between widescreen and fullscreen - but why would anyone in their right mind would choose to watch a grandly visual film like this in fullscreen?

There are several featurettes - one about how Biana Tamimi was cast chiefly for her riding skills; one about how the star horses were found and how they were trained; and a couple more about the location and the filming. I found the explorations of how filming for IMAX differs so dramatically from traditional filming to be the most interesting. It's quite an undertaking and is certainly a challenging process. For the kiddies, there's a Big Black Horse Read-Along.

2217124,2,B0007L6S94,"My kids were bored to death during this movie.  The scenery was pretty and the horses were beautiful to watch but...First off, the girl playing the star sounded like she was from New Jersey, not Arabia.  Then, we couldn't follow the storyline very well--it just didn't make sense.  So, I would not rate this movie very highly at all.  It might be palatable to a 5-year-old.",1104624000,2,373,4.606060606060606
2217125,5,B0007L6S94,"I am a big time horse lover and a fan of Walter Farely's Black Stallion series of books. I also loved the movie The Black Stallion as a child. I used to beg and bed my mom for horse just like The Black. Of course she said that we already had enough horses... but I would reply ""But we don't have The Black"". And what child who read the books and watched the movie didn't want their own Black Stallion? Who didn't want to be in young Alex's place, riding that great horse?

Anyhow on to The Young Black Stallion

It came out on DVD today and I had to rent it. And it is a great movie, ever bit as good at the first The Black Stallion. I can not find anything that I didn't like about the movie. I especially loved the bonus feature at the begining with Gina and The Black's Sire.

I have to say, that unless you are a avid horse lover and a fan of artistic type of movies, this is not the movie for you. But if you loved The Black Stallion you will love this one.",1103587200,3,962,3.948453608247423

On the DVD, there were some extras which I was hoping for when I found this version of Black Stallion.
In particular, I wanted the song, ""Born to Ride."" which is sung near the end of the movie on the DVD.
The Amazon version of the movie is just the story of the race and nothing more, no song ""Born to Ride"" !!
And also it's missing when the Friesian comes down from Heaven to mate with the mare.
Anyway, without the extras it's still a good family movie.",1494806400,,562,4.155963302752293
