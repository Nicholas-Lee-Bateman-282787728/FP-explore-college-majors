4237451,1,B0022FRPRW,"Actually was very poorly done, seemed like a grade school production!",1484524800,,69,5.363636363636363
4237452,5,B0022FRPRW,Excellent film about children caught up in the poverty and want of a soviet satellite during the cold war.  The efforts and the sacrifices these two children male to gain freedom should cause all of us who take freedom for granted to take a careful look at what we have.,1483833600,,270,4.4
4237453,4,B0022FRPRW,"Excellent performances by the two boys, in a gripping story that takes place in still-Soviet-dominated Poland. Bleak landscapes and equally bleak lives for the beleaguered family, victimized by the daily insults to their dignity and by the incessant pressures and cruelties of the repressive regime under which they live. The unbelievable tale of the boys' escape, alone and without a real plan, grips the viewer's attention and sympathies, and we root for their survival, and salute their amazing bravery and determination. I loved this film, despite really poor English subtitles!",1483747200,,582,5.477777777777778
4237454,4,B0022FRPRW,"Based on true events, this is a heart-breaking story about two young brothers aged 12 and 15 who escape from Poland to Denmark in 1985. (In reality, they escape to Sweden.) I searched to see what became of the boys, but had no luck. This 1989 movie ends with the two boys still in Denmark, seeking asylum. In one of the last scenes they had a phone conversation with their parents. In reality, did they succeed in gaining asylum? What happened to their younger twin brothers? Were they taken away from their parents, as the Polish authorities threatened? Did the parents face additional sanctions? With the dissolution of the Soviet Union and its satellites, was the family permanently reunited in Sweden? I wish a sequel was made to this movie. I believe anyone wo saw 300 miles from Heaven would like updated information. As things stand, I was left with two many questions to make this movie an enjoyable experience. 3 1/2 stars.",1480896000,6,932,4.723926380368098
4237455,5,B0022FRPRW,"It's a true story about poverty, love and most of all freedom.",1480204800,,62,4.25
4237456,4,B0022FRPRW,"I""m glad I bumped into this touching film streaming on Amazon. It gave me a real feel for the conditions that existed near the end of the Soviet empire, a time when awareness of the disparity between life in western Europe and eastern Europe was growing to a point where people had to act.
Certainly worth watching, subtitles are serviceable.",1479772800,,342,4.716666666666667
4237457,4,B0022FRPRW,Sad and moving picture about the extent of brotherly love and what it was to yearn for freedom in communist era Poland. The young actors are authentic and believable. The DVD has no subtitles but the story was quite easy to follow even for someone who does not speak Polish.,1418601600,,274,4.5
4237458,4,B0022FRPRW,"This only reason I did not rate this as a ""5"" is because it is available only in DVD-R and PAL formats.  (Most people
in the U.S. have no idea what PAL is... nor do they know that equipment that plays all formats costs only a few dollars
more than NTSC-only players. They are kept off the shelves because sales staff and customers would be confused-- so
players must usually be ordered on-line.)

""300 Mil Do Nieba"" is what I would describe as a 'bitter-sweet' film.  Although the hardships the boys and their parents
experience are related well, there are also lighter moments;  and the film displays the boys' (usually) hopeful outlook
on life.  And I do not agree with the opinion that the Danish officials were all that strict and demanding... the boys
were cleaned up, given new clothes, fed well, provided with a Polish-speaking representative, given spending money, and
allowed to roam the city!

All of the children acted well, and the younger brother was a charmer. It is a real shame that more people can't see
this movie.  English subtitles are large and easy to read.",1366070400,,1079,4.677248677248677

8411448,4,B0022FRPRW,Very interesting relating about 2 young brothers searching for freedom away from the stifling Polish government. Based on a true story.,1486166400,,135,5.476190476190476
8411449,5,B0022FRPRW,So moving.  The plight of children under oppression and poverty.  They feel the misery and hopelessness of their parents and try to help.  A real statement of the suffering in a totalitarian regime and the struggle for psychological and physical freedom,1485993600,,253,5.121951219512195
8411450,5,B0022FRPRW,Courageous brothers: their pluck and determination is amazing and admirable.  The stark contrast of their bleak life in communist Poland with Big Brother always interfering in one's life and the prosperity and freedoms of Denmark is portrayed with clarity. The children's acting is excellent.  This bittersweet film is well worth seeing and vividly reminds one of the privileges taken for granted in the West.,1485388800,,409,5.375
