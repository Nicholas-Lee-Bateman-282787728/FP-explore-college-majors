When it did play, there was no menu structure as there would be with a normal dvd.  She would have to click on a file, each file is one and a half episodes, no way of knowing which episode.

I just cant understand the writers being able to consistantly keep the quality so high. Now we are in the 6th season ,I feel it's lost it's funniness ,I mean writers cant keep writing great lines forever ,sadly they should just pack it in .They have left us a legacy and I have been watching this series over and over since May and I still laugh although I might have seen each segment 4 or 5 times.

When you have tuned in, there are some magic moments with physics in-jokes that are funny on several levels. Sheldon is an extraordinary creation, an authentic sufferer from Asperger's Syndrome. We all probably know someone at least a little like that. The classic symptoms are low social intelligence, hiding of feelings and poor communication skills. We need not feel sorry for the poor fellow and can laugh at his gaffes because aspics are thick-skinned, too self-absorbed to care about disapproval by others. The other 3 male characters seem to be based on generic models of normal, Jewish and Indian physicists. The shows I have watched so far, only the 1st season, are very fast moving considering their abstract topics and a delight to observe and re-watch with friends.",1352246400,,854,5.02112676056338

But talking about the product itself, its great. I love the plot line of Big Bang Theory, and throughout the seasons, I have really grown a connection with each character. The show is very witty, nerdy, however humorous and cute. There are not many sexually jokes compared to a sitcom say New Girl, but throughout the seasons it progresses. I love the amount of comic book jokes, nerd problems, for example... nerds not getting a chance with girls.

This show is definitely for the little more intelligent, even I don't understand all the jokes they make and I'm a freshmen in college. Hopefully as the seasons continue and I grow wiser in science, I will understand more, laugh more, and fall in love with the characters even more.

Sheldon is an eccentric physicist with Nobel Prize potential and limited social skills.
