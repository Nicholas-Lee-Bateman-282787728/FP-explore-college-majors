739126,5,6303957013,"Fox made a bunch of these Bio classics and they are all superb.  This one ranks right up there with the rest and is fairly accurate.  Henry Fonda steels this picture though.  He is very funny in the few scenes he is in.  A very moving story that is factual as well as entertaining.  Another homeschool friendly flick...with a tad bit more romance than Tom Edison, but nothing like movies of today.  An ejoyable movie for the whole family that could breed some good discussion afterwards!",1098316800,8,487,4.604651162790698
739127,5,6303957013,"This movie is a favorite classic! All the actors do a superb job at bringing together everything a good movie needs... suspense, romance... drama... good versus the evil businessmen... and it makes you feel good to watch it. I'm an electronics teacher and show this to my high school students who love the movie! (It is not easy to inspire kids these days!!!) I've seen it over 20 times now showing it to all my students, and still love watching it!",1042156800,10,449,4.555555555555555
739128,4,6303957013,"Those were the very first words spoken (and successfully received by another party) via telephone by Alexander Graham Bell, the Scotsman who invented the telephone.  The tale begins in 1875.  Young Alex Bell is shown eating cheese and apples while trying to send speech over copper wires.  No one thinks much of this idea except the deaf daughter of one of his grudging sponsors (the deaf girl is Loretta Young). Folks were inclined to call it a toy and they kept away from it; Bell himself tended to distust it.  When Bell wants an ambulance, he sends a friend out to call one.  ""This thing will never work"" he lamented.  But it did of course, and soon the Western Union was trying to claim the patent...Don Ameche does rather well here, playing Bell with surprising conviction.  Henry Fonda is fine as the sensible Mr. Watson as is Charles Coburn as the methodical Mr. Hubbard. The most moving scene in the entire film is when a mute boy, who had never spoken before, enunciates the word ""father"" (sob!).  The direction by Irving Cummings is piously sincere.",1026345600,14,1060,4.691891891891892

739262,5,6303957013,Great film about how the first telephone was invented.  It is so good at times to be able to see the beginnings of what transpired when we didn't have the technology we have today.  We are indeed fortunate to have had all the inventors of the things we rely on today.  The film is very worthwhile.,1433376000,,297,4.267857142857143

739341,4,6303957013,"They don't make them like this anymore. It's the classic struggling inventor story, living in a garret with his buddy Watson and half starving to save money to buy the gizmos he needed for his telephone. There's the usual romance. There's the touching story of Bell's work teaching deaf children to speak. There's the triumphant demonstration before a skeptical crowd. There's the challenge that seems ready to destroy his incipient enterprise. Then, of course, the triumph.

It's not perfect, so I'll give it four stars, not five, but it is an awful lot of fun.",1410220800,,562,4.91578947368421
739342,5,6303957013,This was a very  interesting tale of the life of Alexander Graham Bell and more so because of the fine acting of Loretta Young,1403481600,,126,4.25
739343,5,6303957013,"When older people will talk about the Ameche, they are talking about the telephone, as this film was popular in its day.
Don Ameche plays Bell during the period in his life just before inventing the telephone -- where he just about starved, got kicked out of boarding houses, begged for funds so he could buy supplies for his inventions.

The always beautiful Loretta Young plays Bell's future wife -- she is deaf and lip reads.  Her father, played by Charles Coburn -- a fabulous character actor and great comic actor -- funds Bell's research.

He gets the telephone to work, founds the Bell Company and installs his device all over the Northeast -- until a competing company steals his technology and almost wipes him out.  He could have quit, but Young's character sticks by him through the legal wranglings.  ""Ma Bell"" survives, of course.  The rest, as they say, is history.

If you didn't know the details of how the Ameche -- er -- telephone -- was invented, read a book or watch this movie.",1403222400,,998,4.636363636363637
739344,5,6303957013,"The family's great grandma said that when she was younger, she remembered that for a long time after this movie, many people called the telephone ""The Don Ameche"" because he did such a great job of acting in the movie. Great Grandma is no longer around, but when I saw this, I wanted to have it to share with everyone at a family gathering. Great history story for all of the kids too !",1397865600,,386,4.22972972972973
739345,5,6303957013,"Great clean family movie. Though this is based on the inventor it gives a look into the struggles and romantic involvement of Alexander Bell. Others make claim Alexander Bell stole their idea and invention trying out do him because financial success the telephone will bring.  Great actors included Henry Fonda was very funny, Charles Coburn, Spring Byington. If you are a fan of classic movies its a must have for your collection.",1388016000,,431,4.986111111111111
739346,5,6303957013,Another Hollywood epic on the life of a great inventor. Again dramatized for public consumption but in general terms a good representation of A.G.Bell's discovery of the telephone.,1386633600,,180,5.464285714285714
739347,5,6303957013,"Don Ameche Is fabulous as Alexander Graham Bell.  Long a favorite of mine in musical entertainers, Don Ameche proves his mettle in a serious bio of one of America's premiere inventors.  The supporting cast includes Henry Fonda in a secondary role as Bell's assistant, Mr. Watson, and he does a fine job of it. Of course, there is always the reliable and inimitable talents of Charles Coburn to add just enough character to the story and his is a plum role as well.  All in all a very well acted and well directed film.",1384992000,,518,4.48936170212766
739348,5,6303957013,I really like old movies and this one did not disappoint. It was a double winner for me because it was base on a awesome piece of history. loved it,1381968000,,147,3.933333333333333

739365,5,6303957013,"Every now and then I discover a real gem as I watch some of the older movies (pre-1950's). This has a nice biographical story of Alexander Graham Bell, well-acted, fine sets and scenery, and with some tension. Films like this don't need violence or weird humour or twisty plots or overacting! This is simply a good movie!",1371254400,,321,4.649122807017544
739366,5,6303957013,I REALLY ENJOYED THIS MOVIE VERY MUCH. I LOVE HISTORICAL MOVIES A LOT. THE MOVIE IS WORTH PURCHASING AND WATCHING.,1370390400,,114,4.75
739367,5,6303957013,"Great story telling you how the telephone came about.  Also, I believe that this is the only movie which Loretta Young has two siblings in.",1367366400,,139,4.56
739368,2,6303957013,"I purchased this DVD at the end of 2012, when it was first released, because I wanted to replace my VHS version.  I LOVE this movie. I use it as a teaching tool for adult students learning English as a Second Language (to teach vocabulary and American history).  The first time I played it, I discovered that there is NO CLOSED CAPTIONING!  And this DVD is a 20th Century Fox studio copy!  I thought all recent DVDs had closed captioning. Next time, I'll look at the product description and details more carefully.  I've gone back to using my VHS copy.  I'm going to sell the DVD (on Amazon) to someone who does not need closed captioning (which is also helpful for a hearing-impaired family member).",1364256000,,700,4.56
739369,5,6303957013,I love the old movies. This is one they don't show on TV much. Was surprised to see they had it on DVD. If you like the old movies you should try this one.,1361318400,,155,3.588235294117647
739370,5,6303957013,"This is a delightful film.  As a school nurse I tell my ADHD students to watch this with their family.  Because they are the artists and inventors of the world.  They are the ones who make life enjoyable for the rest of us if they learn to harness their energy and steadfastly follow where their dreams lead.  And if they are successful, they can hire someone to do the paperwork someday.  And after watching it, see if you can dig up Bell's written biography.  He was working on a motorized airplane at the same time the Wright Brothers, only Bell did his research and study out in the open where anyone was welcomed to watch.  Bell's successful first plane flight was financed by a handicapped woman - his wife.  There are wonderful stories out there of real people who are proof that others have survived the wars without and the wars within and have succeeded and thrived.  I know they can help boost the self esteem of children, especially those in difficult situations.  I know because this was one of the ones who inspired me.",1350432000,,1033,4.535135135135135
739371,5,6303957013,"This is a very well done film starring Don Ameche as Alexander Graham Bell and Loretta Young as his encouraging wife.  Don Ameche's portrayal of Alexander Graham Bell is very nice and sympathetic and one feels his glee when he is happy.  One also sympathizes with him when he gives his heroic speech for the lone inventor in court.  Loretta's portrayal of his wife is very nice as well, a little on the melodramatic side which is typical for the time period.  But still very admirable and enjoyable.  One of the cute vignettes throughout the movie are the comments of Henry Fonda as Bell's assistant Watson.  I laughed at nearly everything he said.  Everybody in my family enjoyed watching this movie and I believe yours will too!",1314230400,4,730,4.700787401574803
739372,5,6303957013,"I LOVE Loretta Young. She's a fox and I love her.

739373,2,6303957013,"I bought this video new.  The story line is excellent.  The acting is excellent.  The scene in the courtroom is clever and excellent.  The depiction of American history is excellent.  The costumes are stylized and overwrought, as was typical during the earlier days of Hollywood.  The film is an excellent teaching device for kids.  This film was one of the eternal favorites of our parents' generation and our grandparents' generation.  But there is a slight problem.  There are irritating crackling noises throughout.  Why is this?  The crackling noises make the movie almost unbearable.  I was only able to watch this otherwise excellent movie only once.  I own about 50 videotapes, many of them bought second hand.  Crackling noises of the same type occur on only one of these, namely, Three Stooges in Orbit, which I bought new.  Can any of the reviewers of this product provide insight as to the source of the noises?  Can somebody please tell the manufacturer that they need to do something about the noises.",1128384000,7,1015,4.9171597633136095
