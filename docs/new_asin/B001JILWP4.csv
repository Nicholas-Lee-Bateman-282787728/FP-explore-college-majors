8312962,3,B001JILWP4,"A time voyage through lands and folks to save a future world, peppered with sexy dancing and Indian tunes (misucal, buff-opera?) is too complicated for kids and hardly grasping the adult attention.",1271289600,2,197,5.1875
8312963,3,B001JILWP4,"This is a very different movie for Bollywood. It is an attempt to do myth and fantasy in a stylistic way.  As much as anything the soundtrack and many of the sets let it down.
There are a couple of strong tunes when there are songs but in between the background mood track has odd ideosynchratic sounds and doesnt build a mood effectively. It cuts the ground out from under potentially powerful moments by having odd tinkles rather than a rousing buid in sound.
The opening number has a jazz sound (unlike all the other music in the movie - fortunately) and an odd old Hollywood song and dance type number with it. This bore no relation to the rest of the movie and was a bit grating. I would guess this could have symbolic significance but was lost on me.
They went for a certain arty look with basic sets that were often stripped down and looked more like a child's playroom. One set when it crumbles lookes clearly like polystyrene. This is again probably arty but makes the movie more B-grade to look at and detracts from the mythic feel. I would have liked some more classically fantasy type sets to give the film more substance so that they didn't look like they were battling out at the end of the universe somewhere on some barren planet.
There are few people in the entire movie besides the main characters and shadowy robed figures that get slaughtered throughout. So the film has an empty quality.
I must say we disagree with the other reviewers about Abhishek. He was more than adequate to the part. He looked handsome and mythic in his garb and moved well with the sword play. He definitely had a stature appropriate to the part. Little really was required from his acting in this movie other than various mythic poses and he carried that well.
Priyanka was fine but there seemed to be no chemistry between her and Abhishek (perhaps Ash was too much on his mind!) They didn't really allow time for romance though anyway.
There was a comment among those watching that it was creatively odd in a way that David Bowie wouldnt look out of place wandering through it! It feels like some of the odder cult sci-fi Hollywood movies.
So marks for effort in doing something different, a few decent tunes and Abhishek looked more charismatic than I've seen him. However I don't think it's one movie I'd hang onto.",1229040000,3,2315,4.538277511961723
8312964,3,B001JILWP4,"Combining pieces of all sorts of different mythologies and fantasy stories, Goldie Behl's ""Drona"" never really comes together as a whole.  Abhishek Bachchan is out of his depth in an action hero role, but Priyanka Chopra lights up the screen as his trusty bodyguard.  Although ""Drona"" is by no means a great film, it does have some great moments that save it from total failure.  Kay Kay Menon's demon is pretty hilarious and it is always nice to see Jaya Bachchan on screen - even as somebody's mummy (yet again).

Just sit back and let the non-sensical plot wash over you...

8312965,1,B001JILWP4,"Let's be honest here and say that Abishek Bachchan and Priyanka Chopra are two of the lousiest actors to have come out of Bollywood. I rented this film from an Indian video store and I am sorry I wasted $3.00 on it. I wish I could get my money back. Please save your money and look elsewhere. Not only is the dialogue stupid, but the scenes are choppy, the actors CAN'T act and the story makes absolutely no bloody sense. It starts out in modern day somewhere in Europe and ends up somewhere in la la land. The director, Goldie Behl needs to find another hobby.",1226707200,,561,4.30188679245283
