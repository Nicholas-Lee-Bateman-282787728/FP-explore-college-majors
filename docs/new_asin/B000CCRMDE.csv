8325034,3,B000CCRMDE,"This is a cute retelling of Kipling's famous tale, a nice kids' movie.  The animals' mouths don't move, but hey, this is pre-CGI.  We can use our imaginations and it is fine as it is.  My main disappointment was that their selection of animals wasn't entirely accurate, considering this is supposed to be the jungle of India: they include a skunk (a strictly American animal) and chimpanzees (strictly African animals).  Also the wolves are obviously wolf-dogs or huskies, which is understandable considering it probably would be difficult to find full-blooded wolves to work with in a movie, but it did make it seem less authentic.  However, if you don't mind that it isn't a very accurate representation of the Indian jungle, it is a nice enough children's movie.",1478476800,,765,4.9453125

8325036,4,B000CCRMDE,This movie is hilarious!  Some have criticized the film because the animals' mouths never move.  But the comedic script more than makes up for this. Some of the action scenes with the animals are actually very well done.  And this was before CGI!,1468627200,,246,4.674418604651163
8325037,4,B000CCRMDE,"Well, different perspective on old story. Kids liked it.",1462838400,,56,5.333333333333333
8325038,5,B000CCRMDE,I showed this to my class. We were reading about the new Jungle Book movie and I wanted to give them some background. They really liked it.,1461024000,,139,4.185185185185185
8325039,3,B000CCRMDE,I give it 3 stars because my daughter loved it. She loves animals and the idea that a kid could live out with real animals is exciting for her at 7yrs old. I watched it for her pleasure only and honestly oiled 3 pairs of boots while we sat there just so I wouldn't be totally wasting my time.,1458000000,,292,3.9661016949152543
