7907362,4,B00000F7F3,"Anna Akhmatova was a brilliant poet with a dramatic and tragic life story, like most of the people who lived in Russia during the 20th century. She chronicles not only pain she has endured personally either in love or in patriotism or in struggles against Stalin... she also chronicles the struggles of her people.
This video does not begin to tell of her life or her stark and powerful poetry, but it will provide an excellent introduction that will inspire new readers or longtime admirers alike.",980899200,2,498,4.8023255813953485
