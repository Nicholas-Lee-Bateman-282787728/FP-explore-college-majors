8679133,2,B00NME2WEI,"I vaguely remember this being shown in 1980's as it was made in 1979; it was a follow up to the successful shows based in the Mediterranean like `Who pays the ferryman?' which was also written by Michael J Bird. The plot centred around our main man David Collier who is going to Cyprus to visit his ill brother. Only by the time he has got there his brother has died in a car accident.

Then things get very strange and David starts to feel that all is not as it seems - especially as people have a habit of disappearing on him right at the very wrong moment. As more nefarious carryings on present themselves he starts to feel that his brother may have been involved in more than the building project he was working on and that his death may not have been an accident.

Now that is the plot, what follows are eight episodes totalling around 400 minutes of screen time. This really shows its age, the actors are mostly BBC posh and all invariably English who put on stereotype accents - which they often forget to fake and slip back into Toff speak- as we were not quite ready for real foreigners to infest our prime time back then. All the men seem expert at karate chops which render all recipients paralysed no matter how unconvincing the `chop' actually is. We have stunt doubles that stick out like a badly placed microphone boom, over acting that would work in a panto and so much filler.

The filler is everywhere like a tour of a badly organised mattress factory. Shots of people walking, making the tea, running, sleeping, staring out at the real location or just doing bugger all - Jeez it just seems interminable. Peter McEnery plays David but he comes across as a second division Little Lord Fauntleroy - then Brian Blessed turns up and does an accent but is essentially himself so manages to pull it back on the comedy front - but this is supposed to be all serious.

Then we find out that ancient Greek Gods are messing with everything so where I thought they had plot holes they were actually just the play things of the Deities having a laugh. The fashion is great though as it is all awful and was sort of out of date by the time this came out - if you were hip that is. The dance scenes are hilarious so I congratulate the choreographer - the last time I saw a man move like that he had to be given first aid afterwards.

Oh and the music is clunky, the cars are good especially the Fiat X1/9, but I really struggled to get through this and felt the editor must have been asleep for most of this as indeed I would have preferred to be. As a time capsule it only barely works as it is all BBC middle class, as a story it drags itself around like a sloth on mogadon and as a piece of entertainment it should have been left in the archives. If this was what we had to look forward to in the seventies no wonder we never complained about the power cuts.",1440806400,3,2867,4.27255985267035
