8179466,4,B00006SFKD,"I'm a little surprized not many reviews on this flick, "" Duel of The Tao Tough"" considering it's an o.k flick.  There are many old school kung fu moves in this one.  The art of Kung Fu very transparent and present.  This flick is very entertaining from the get-go! Definately another wu gem!!

I'm not one to give details about a flick,,to me that's a gross dis-service! For the plot, there is a detailed discription provided by amazon!!",1149552000,2,437,4.564102564102564
