8637276,5,B00HYBGN2M,"Big Voice is a wonderfully uplifting documentary about teenagers
striving for excellence and the choir teacher who demands it. This film
offers a glimpse into a world that most people know nothing about. I
was completely drawn in by the teacher, the students and their stories.
This incredibly demanding pursuit is only one of the many activities
they each juggle and yet each time the bar is raised, they strive to
meet it. The filmmakers did a wonderful job of making the audience feel
like we were at the choir rehearsals and part of what was happening on
screen. I was incredibly inspired by the students and wold love to know
what they are doing now.",1475798400,3,655,4.655172413793103
