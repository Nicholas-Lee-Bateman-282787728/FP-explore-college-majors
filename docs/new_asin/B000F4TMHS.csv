8117534,4,B000F4TMHS,"Of the 4 features, Project Moonbase looked the best, and there were no issues.  The Phantom Planet also looked quite good, but it was presented only in a full screen version.  Destination Moon and First Spaceship on Venus both suffer from mediocre prints.  They are both good to watch, but First Spaceship has sloppy edits at what looks like the reel changes, losing some words.  I realize this was dubbed and edited from the original film, but some of the music they added was stolen from Universal horror films of the 40's, and just doesn't work.  Destination Moon deserves to be cleaned up.",1355184000,8,593,4.718446601941747
8117535,4,B000F4TMHS,"Good collection of Sci-Fi B films.  Some would argue that ""Destination Moon"" isn't a B film but I'll let you be the judge on that one.

The 1st two films ""Phantom Planet"" and ""First Spaceship On Venus"" I 1st saw on the one of those 50 packs of sci-fi movies which are mostly of low quality video.  This set isn't like that.  All of these have been restored and are quite pleasant to watch.",1325203200,16,389,4.216216216216216
8117536,4,B000F4TMHS,"If you like sci-fi flicks, this is a nice little selection at a good price.  Sure, these movies have silly plots.  They are dated, and the acting isn't so hot.  But they're fun to watch.  And I don't really see these listed on TV, so if you want to see these films, here's an inexpensive way to do it.  The film quality isn't perfect, but I'm guessing the original film quality on these 4 old movies wasn't terrific by today's standards, and these are not the sorts of ""great films"" that are likely to be restored and enhanced.  Do I care?  Nope.  Personally, if I can easily watch the film and listen to it, it's just fine.  I don't think it serves any purpose to get finicky about quality in regard to these oldies.  Just sit back and enjoy.",1313798400,20,743,4.280575539568345
