8417447,4,B0046SBH2M,Really good learning material for the GPSMAP62 beginner. I learned ALOT about using my GPS with this program.,1497312000,,109,5.111111111111111
8417448,1,B0046SBH2M,I had thought it was a book. The CD was really bad & I wouldn't want anyone to spend money on this. See UTube it has more on the Device.,1439856000,,136,3.566666666666667
8417449,2,B0046SBH2M,Not very good,1423958400,,13,3.6666666666666665
8417450,3,B0046SBH2M,This book offers good basic guidance that will get the novice started down the right path.  I learned about some functions of my GPSMap 62st that I probably would never have used had I not read this guide.,1394323200,,205,4.394736842105263
8417451,5,B0046SBH2M,I purchased this DVD to better understand my Garmin Gps and it surpassed my expectations.  If you want to totally understand your Garmin Maps GPS this is the key to all the mystery.,1392595200,,181,4.484848484848484
8417452,1,B0046SBH2M,This video did not instruct me in way to use the GPS. It told me what buttons did what but not how to use them. On line I could find out what all the buttons did. I wanted to know how to make a trek and so on. This video would get a very minimal rating. I would not recommend this video to any body else.,1392336000,,304,3.621212121212121
8417453,1,B0046SBH2M,This was a disappointing purchase. It was not very helpful. Need to have better ways to illustrate how to use the GPS.,1355011200,,118,4.409090909090909
