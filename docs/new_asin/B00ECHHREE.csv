8603820,4,B00ECHHREE,"As a long time fan of TNA I was looking forward to seeing this show. While I would have taken it a step further this event is actually pretty good. This show does attempt at being kinda old school with a good Aries vs. Dutt vs. Sabin X-Division opener, a good Bully Ray vs. Tommy Dreamer Falls Count Anywhere Match, and a great Jeff Hardy vs. Abyss Monster's Ball Match. But they also did some matches that weren't old school at all, even going as far to do a more current World Title Match (one of the very few times a championship is defended at a One Night Only show). Not every match is a winner but overall is a good show. I'd say it's more Old School-ish. But good show.",1429401600,,676,4.1679389312977095
8603821,4,B00ECHHREE,"This PPV is part of the second season of the ""TNA: One Night Only"" series which are just stand alone PPV events (shows that occur outside the current storylines & happenings on IMPACT Wrestling) with each one having a special theme with this season being more recently taped than the previous season so it reflects the talents current gimmicks & feuds.  This edition titled ""#OldSchool"" was based on superstars of the past & present having a night of revisiting feuds from the past with Mike Tenay & Taz doing commentary on this show.

Austin Aries vs. Sonjay Dutt vs. Chris Sabin - Sabin was the odd man out as he attempted to avoid both men early by standing outside allowing his two opponents to fight each other only for Aries to dominate both men individually that it took double teaming in order to gain the advantage with their egos getting in the way on more than one occasion.

Dewey Barns vs. Ethan Carter III - EC3 issued a challenge to Barnes & outside of a few shots here & there, this was a dominate squash.

Falls Count Anywhere Match: Tommy Dreamer vs. Bully Ray - While this feud goes back to almost 2 decades ago during their time in the original ECW, this match was setup based off Bully's invasion of Dreamer's House Of Hardcore show weeks earlier.  Both men started out trading fist with the fight getting taken to the outside quickly with both men using whatever the could to their advantage from beers to the guardrail before implementing a table into the action along with more weapons to either beat on each other with or put their bodies through including some cringe worthy moments when the guardrail was brought into the ring in a brawl that you would expect from both men with their hardcore reputations.

Bad Influence & Velvet Sky vs. BroMans & Lei'd Tapa - Eric Young was the special referee for this with Bad Influence getting the advantage for their team on more than one occasion resulting in Tapa being the difference maker whenever possible in either using her size advantage to overpower Velvet or getting a shot in on Kaz & Daniels whenever possible while BroMans used illegal tactics such as double teaming behind the referee which were tactics Bad Influence had no problem using along with Velvet using a different tactic that worked to her team's advantage.  A fun mixed tag match.

Monsters Ball: Jeff Hardy vs. Abyss - A rematch from their feud in 2005 that saw them compete in various hardcore matches including a Monsters Ball match as Abyss clearly showed the power advantage early while Hardy kept attempting to use his speed with a ""hit & move"" offense along with using weapons such as a chair & the apron to help him with his daredevil offense only for Abyss to use the weapons to his advantage as well by launching & driving Hardy into or through the weapon itself as we continued to see more weapons involved throughout the match from thumbtacks to barbed wire boards that broke when one man landed on it with such impact & even Abyss' old girlfriend ""Janice"" made an appearance.  This match heavily resembled their critically acclaimed Falls Count Anywhere Match from years ago where both men gave as much punishment as they took.

Kurt Angle vs. Mr. Anderson - Their 2010 feud revisited with Anderson attempting to out-wrestle Kurt in the beginning to no avail only to catch an advantage with a mistiming by Angle opening the door for Anderson to heavily work over Angle's shoulder while staying one step ahead of Kurt allowing him to injure another body part on Kurt that came into play various times Angle attempted to comeback until he was finally able to catch Anderson.  This match was different than their previous encounters as Angle was on defense for a majority of the match instead of it being a more competitive encounter.

Last Man Standing Match: James Storm vs. Bobby Roode - You saw the direction this match was going when the fight was taken to the floor within the opening minutes with one man being thrown into the steps & suplexed on the isleway floor & participating in some fan interaction while the other was sent into the guardrail & ring post as the fight started to get more hardcore with various weapons being brought into the ring & used by both men delivering some hard shots to both the head & other parts of the body.  I can't recall the former members of Beer Money having a bad match against each other & this was no exception as this match was very physical from start to finish.

TNA Champion Magnus vs. Samoa Joe - The former Tag Team Champions & Main Event Mafia members reignited their past feud in the first ever championship defense of a TNA title on a ""One Night Only"" event as Magnus attempted to intimidate Joe only for him to respond with various strikes to the chest both in & outside of the ring with Magnus coming back with some impactful moves of his own as they traded momentum with both men countering & catching the other into their own offensive along with various offensive combinations.  Both men have good chemistry with & against each other with this match being no exception.

Overall this was a good PPV with some strong performances from the talents involved so I recommend.",1428019200,,5186,4.639040348964013
8603822,5,B00ECHHREE,"Another one of these ""One Night Only"" gimmick shows. The concept looked pretty simple, random tag team matches (by luck of the draw), advance to a battle royal, with 100 grand. And amazingly this show was much better than I thought! Picking wrestlers at random by luck of the draw to crate these tag teams was a great move. Even with the DVD in hand (and basically the full results on the back) I legit got excited to see who was going to pair up.

The matches themselves are actually really good and entertaining. These team combinations (like Bobby Roode and Joseph Park for example) make for a very entertaining show.

The main event was pretty solid, though I like the tag matches just a little bit more.

Overall a pretty awesome show.

On another note: This is the only One Night Only DVD so far that doesn't have 30 minutes of over-shown recycled clips, which helps this show out tremendously. Worth checking out.",1404604800,,920,4.591463414634147
8603823,3,B00ECHHREE,"The James Storm/Christian York-Gunner/Crimson tag team bout was sloppy but not that bad. The Jessie Godderz/Mr Anderson-Douglas Williams/Kid Kash Tag match was solidly booked but had a unspectacular end. The Robbie E/Zema Ion-Bobby Roode/Joseph Park tag bout was not great but pretty good. The Hernandaz/Alex Silva-Devon/Doc tag match was so-so at best. The Robbie T/Matt Morgan-Joey Ryan/Al Snow tag team bout was garbage. The $100,000 Gauntlet battle royal was your average gauntlet/battle royal but still good in its own right. I give this PPV a 5 out of 10.",1380326400,,561,5.314606741573034
8603824,3,B00ECHHREE,"This PPV is part of the ""TNA: One Night Only"" series which are just stand alone PPV events (shows that occur outside the current storylines & happenings on IMPACT Wrestling) which each one having a special theme.  This edition was based around the old WCW concept of ""Battlebowl: The Lethal Lottery"" where tag teams are put together via random drawing to compete against each other with the winning teams advancing to a gauntlet battle royal with the sole winner receiving a check for $100,000 with Mike Tenay & Taz did commentary on this show.

James Storm & Christian York vs. Gunner & Crimson - Things went back & forth between both teams early before Crimson took a cheap shot for his team to get the advantage as they singled out Christian York with moves like a one of Taz's tazplex & Tully Blanchard's slingshot suplex before all four men got in the ring with Storm & York doing some good teamwork like a drop toehold into the corner followed by a cannonball, catapult into a DDT, and codebreaker followed by top rope double foot stomp.  This was a very solid tag team match with two teams who hadn't teamed up together before on TV but showed actual chemistry.

Jessie Godderz & Mr. Anderson vs. Douglas Williams & Kid Kash - It should be noted that Williams & Kash had teamed together on the previous ""One Night Stand: X-Travaganza"" while Mr. Anderson was in his normal ring gear & mic drop entrance and not in his Aces & Eights gear.  Jessie attempted to be the leader of his team by taking control but was easily worked over by the other team causing Anderson to tag in & regain control for his team only for him to tag himself back in saying ""I got it!"" while trying to hot the spotlight which frustrated Anderson as Williams & Douglas kept working over Jessie individually & together with double teaming.  This was one of those matches were if you understood the story being told between Anderson & Jessie then you'll find this match entertaining.

Christopher Daniels & Samoa Joe vs. Chavo Guerrero & Rob Van Dam - RVD gained control with his team using a unique wishbone stretch on Daniels causing Joe to be tagged in leading to a stalemate between the two before Chavo came in with Joe working him over while Daniels took shots on the outside as he kept Chavo grounded only for Daniels to make the blind tag attempting to take control which only left the door open for RVD to come in & dominate leading to a situation where the end result was more about one team catching the other than being the dominate team.  This was a solid encounter that told the story throughout the match of one team showing teamwork together while the other team were working as individuals.

Bobby Roode & Joseph Park vs. Robbie E & Zema Ion - Roode made it clear that he wasn't happy with who his partner was & tried to wrestle the match alone & kept teasing Park as if he was going to tag him in before it eventually happened with Robbie & Ion trying to get offense on Park only to keep bouncing off him causing both men to double team & constantly work him over to the point where he was busted open causing Park to react how he usually does in that situation.  This was pretty much the same Joseph Park style of match that you always get with him with Roode playing the role well of the man who didn't take his partner seriously.

Hernandez & Alex Silva vs. Devon & D.O.C. - This match here was pretty short & sweet with the story being that Aces & Eights singled out the younger & less experienced Silvia maintaining control of the match working him over while Hernandez had to keep getting involved to save his partner & take back control in what turned out to be a watchable match at least.

Rob Terry & Matt Morgan vs. Joey Ryan & Al Snow - Joey Ryan was in a no win situation with his tag partner on the opposite team & his partner being the person he had issues with on Gut Check for months causing Ryan to try to walk away from the match only for Snow to throw him back in but refused to work together with Snow & tag into the match to the point where he was encouraging the other team to keep beating up on Snow while Morgan was still looking out for Ryan including pulling his Terry off a pin that would have had Morgan advance to the gauntlet which got to the point where Snow & Terry worked together to force Morgan & Ryan against each other.  Joey Ryan getting the bad luck of the draw here in teaming with Snow but also facing Morgan so this told the story of Morgan & Ryan trying to look out for each other at the expense of their own tag partners for this match which made it the match entertaining.

Gauntlet Battle Royal - This battle royal happened ""Royal Rumble"" style where a new competitor entered in after a certain amount of time with the last man standing winning the money resulting in some moments such as the battle between the first & last two men in the ring, a Beer Money reunion, various interactions with the men who were partners earlier in the night, moments of dominance from Morgan to even Robbie T (yes, you read that right), and Aces & Eights trying to play the numbers game to their advantage.  This wasn't much of a memorable battle royal but it was entertaining & served it's purpose.

In the end, I'll say TNA executed this ""Jokers Wild"" concept better than I remember WCW doing with ""BattleBowl"" with each match telling a different story making the matches good either from a wrestling or entertaining stand point but none of the action here I would say was memorable & the event was easily forgettable once it was over so I recommend if you find this type of concept interesting.",1376352000,,5621,4.405978784956606
