8562252,5,B00B4G228M,"I bought the 3 disc version which includes the documentary movie, behind the scenes disc & CD of live music. The Documentary movie (disc 1) HAS ENGLISH SUBTITLES! It goes into how the members meet, the clubs where they started out playing in & behind the scenes of their live shows. Was great to see how the band came together & how much they all mean to each other. The 2nd disc which is NOT SUBTITLED shows behind the scenes of how the documentary movie was made. Even though not subtitled still a must watch for all non-japanese speaking fans. The 3rd disc is a CD of live music.",1371945600,,582,4.348623853211009
8562253,5,B00B4G228M,"Thanks to the ongoing interaction of an UVERworld staff member with overseas fans on Twitter, the decision has been made to offer this DVD documentary with English subtitles and as a region-free DVD. This means EVERYBODY can watch it.  If you ever wanted to get better acquainted with UVERworld, this will be as good as it gets.

The band was followed from - I believe - March through June 2012 for this behind-the-scenes look. The film was released in theaters in Japan August 22, 2012 and the trailers have been quite promising.

There will be three editions of this DVD - the Blu-ray, the Limited edition (LE) DVD (a 3-disk edition - 2 DVDs and a live CD of the songs included in the movie) and the Regular edition (RE) DVD.

OK - I'm back. This documentary is FABULOUS!!
For non-Japanese-speaking overseas UVERfans, it's a must-have. Not only is the dialogue subbed, but a good portion of some of the longer MC's from Tokyo Dome and other concert DVDs. This is a rare treat.

The movie shifts between the band focusing on their technical and philosophical approach to their music, and talking about their roots in Shiga and their broke-and-struggling years prior to their debut. A visit, or series of visits to their old stomping grounds (B-Flat and HUCKLEBERRY) sparks a lot of memories and discussion and gratitude to the people who helped them. There's an intriguing look at songwriting or ""pre-pro"" camp in Hokkaido, and how the songs take shape. And there are plenty of clips of live performances, song lyrics that are relevant to the discussions, and so forth.  It's two hours of UVER-immersion and personality and passion about what they do.

Please note that if your version has Disc 2, these features are NOT subtitled - only the movie.

For those who purchase the LE version, the cd contains the live performances of songs that were featured in the film, and a LOT of complete MCs from Takuya.

The subtitles are predictably distracting at first. You want to watch the film, but you're so thrilled at knowing what's being said that you don't want to miss a word, and then you miss some action. So, repeat viewings will be a must!",1366243200,,2143,4.708556149732621
