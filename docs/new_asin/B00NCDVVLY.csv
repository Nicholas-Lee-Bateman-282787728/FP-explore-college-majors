6639446,3,B00NCDVVLY,"I read the books, I had hopes for the movies. Unfortunately it fell as flat as the books did for me. They had a half decent plot to work with from the books, but they never took it to the great movie it could have been. I didn't buy the chemistry between the two characters, the character building wasn't there, never once did I ever feel like this was plausible even in the realm of Hollywood fantasy. It felt like a badly casted B movie that dabbled into soft core porn. And I'm a huge sucker for a well written smutty book. I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it.",1532390400,,566,4.108108108108108

6639470,1,B00NCDVVLY,"Im not a young boy anymore, so its pretty significant when I say, this is the absolute worst movie Ive ever seen, in my entire life. Nothing sexy about it, no meaning to it, no sense to it, this movie was simply horrible. I rented it. Thank goodness I was fortunate enough not to have wasted my money on purchasing it. I feel insulted enough that I paid the $4 dollars to rent it and wasted over two hours of my valuable time watching it. If youve never seen this movie, considering yourself lucky. Dont waste your time and the $4 dollars even renting this garbage. Take your $4 and go buy yourself a coffee or an ice cream. Do something that will bring a little satisfaction or joy to your life because, this pathetic movie will bring you nothing but regret for wasting the time to watch it.",1530230400,,792,4.322147651006712

6639479,3,B00NCDVVLY,"Although I find BDSM, dominators, submissive, role playing like animals, the craziest sexual indulgence there was some appeal to the story. I liked Anastasia and thought Christian was an ass (men don't hit ladies).  Best part of the film was at the end when Ana told whipping boy to take a hike. She was not a submissive, if I understood the meaning and her sarcasm and wit was entertaining.",1529712000,,391,4.666666666666667

6639483,1,B00NCDVVLY,"Blah. Tried reading the books too, to see what all the hype was about, and was frustrated by the lack of romance. I was hoping the movie was better. It wasn't. I don't get any chemistry between the two main characters. They just seem like they are going through the motions, with both being unsure of what they want, or how to act, the entire time.",1529280000,,348,4.287878787878788

6639486,3,B00NCDVVLY,"Bought this movie after seeing the hype about the fantasies mentioned and how the women reacted to them. I was disappointed, as I was expecting more sex appeal, but it is so light it can be shown in a church ... :-(",1529107200,,215,4.142857142857143

6639492,2,B00NCDVVLY,The movie fell to meet expectation. There where more and kinkier scenes in the Deadpool movie than this one.,1528329600,,108,4.7368421052631575

6639495,5,B00NCDVVLY,"My first time watching this movie.  It will definitely become a go to classic movie of all time one day.  It is a highly memorable movie with unforgettable characters.  While there is sexual content in the movie, it is not pornographic particularly in nature.  It has love scenes and a very good storyline.  I love the movie and have since watched part two, Fifty Shades Darker.  Now, I'm onto watching part three any day now, which is the final segment of the series thus far.",1528243200,,477,4.552941176470588

6639501,2,B00NCDVVLY,"This was so lame, pretty much just tells you if you're a billionaire you can do what ever you want and treat woman like crapm",1527984000,,125,4.04
6639502,1,B00NCDVVLY,"I guess if you are an ignored, invisible, over-married housewife (probably with kids), then you can envision your hymen regrowing and becoming a virgin again like Anastasia and this would be raunchy sadomasochism for you, but, for the rest of us, this is a tame, polished, Hollywood version of intensity.  I could see how the books were gobbled up by too-long-married housewives because a relationship like Anastasia's is the opposite of being ignored--but still reeks of mutual insecurity and immaturity.

It was boring, and I felt slightly bad for the lead male actor, because his somewhat lazy eye gave away that he was bored by the excessively Hollywood-sanitized, stilted sex scenes.

For Dakota, this may have been some kind of rebellion against her Don Johnson Daddy, so I didn't feel sorry for her, although I wondered if a porn actress would have done better at looking the part.  Notwithstanding her self-bitten lips and other overdone expressions, it was hard for me to believe she was as young as the character.

So, if you are a bored and unwanted wife or similar cohort who fantasizes about being excited, wanted, and revirginized by an obsessively insecure, formerly molested man (that only YOU can understand, right?!), this movie is for you.  For everyone else, who wants or remembers something of authenticity, pass.",1527897600,,1334,5.068493150684931
6639503,5,B00NCDVVLY,"In spite of the prudish and misinformed critics, this is a love story, and the story of a confused victim of childhood abuse who turns around for the girl he loves. I wasn't too sure of it when I read the first book, but after being encourage by others to read the next two, I became addicted. I have read the books (actually audiobooks which I recommend) and watched the moves more times than I can count.
Besides the actual story, I am always mesmerized by the views and daily life of this super rich man.",1527897600,,507,4.291666666666667

This movie was exceptionally horrible - especially the horrible casting job, and the horrible acting from the leads.  I watched half of it hoping that some of the incredible feelings from the books would show on the screen, but nope.  Not a one.

One of my favorite lines in the books was by Dr Flynn to Christian after Anastasia left:  It seems to me that youve been so focused on reaching your goal that you missed the journey you were taking together  I would love to see them together again. They have chemistry.,1524700800,,397,4.324324324324325
6639546,3,B00NCDVVLY,"No ""gray"" in this film. Didn't expect to be so blatant, kinky, & inappropriate in my book. Should have been rated X. I had to stop watching when they went in to ""play"" in the locked torture chamber. Just too much raw sex & I absolutely detest X-rated movies. Its miss-rated. This is not an R film. It's an X. :| jlp",1524700800,,315,4.096774193548387
6639547,4,B00NCDVVLY,"I saw this movie on cable and was fascinated by the characters, so I went and bought the books - all 5 of them (Please E.L. James - give us Fifty Shades Freed from Christian's perspective).  After reading the book, I bought the unrated version and I think it was a good representative of the book in some ways.  Certainly, you finished the movie believing that Christian's way of life - his BDSM was all he could strive for - and I think that was somewhat over emphasized in the movie.  I don't think the movie gave you enough of the reasons that Ana DID fall in love with Christian - he was a bit type-cast as the Dom - and although there were some good scenes that showed him allowing himself to just ""be"" with Ana as a woman and not as his Sub - I think the story was a bit shocking to some people who never or will never read the books.  I think the 2 ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" books give you better insight into the real ways that Christian was changing with Ana's influence.  And of course, when he belted her - and she left, I think that was the first time you really experienced the loss that he felt when she was gone.  Again, not having Dr. Flynn, Christian's psychiatrist even mentioned in ANY of the movies probably lowered some viewers opinion of him that he wasn't trying to make right a life that had started so wrongly - and then continued with ""Mr. Robinson's"" exploitation of him at 15.  But if you did love the movie, please buy the two accompanying books so that you can get an idea of the true depth of both Ana and Christian's journey together - sexually and emotionally.",1524614400,10,1590,4.262458471760797

Dakota Johnson's portrayal of an innocent, virginal college intellectual who's seduced into the ways of a wealthy, dominant personality (with his OWN set of psychological deficits!) is, IMHO.....fascinating.....and fun to watch.  True....the S & M portrayed in the film is puerile and a bit ""vanilla""....and Jamie Dornan's performance is decidedly ""lackluster"".....but (apart from that), the soundtrack is EXCELLENT....and (to me, anyway), the film is quite fun.....if NOT a somewhat ""guilty pleasure"".

6639647,5,B00NCDVVLY,"This movie was amazing! It was far better than any other love story I've read or seen. I picked this masterpiece up after I left my last book club. They wanted me to read some crap about a man who makes it rich in the 20's and falls in love with some ditz named Daisy. Boo! No way. Booooorrrriiiing. After they asked me to read a book about some woman that blind and deaf and could only talk with her hands, I was like, I'm outta here. Me and the girls in mynew book club (aka the the zinfadel club LOL) immediately read this entire series. It was hot and steamy and really got my toaster  going, If you know what I mean. ;-) We all went to see a matinee after church let out. Let me tell you what, if my husband had been home after watching this, I woulda let him kiss me on the lips. Woooo! No holding back! But I had to take the kids to soccer practice, so I just let him watch me shave my legs.  He was begging for it, I tell ya.
Soon...maybe, just maybe...we might do it with the lights on after a box of wine.  I don't know yet though. But when I take 2 tylenol #3's I can get pretty wild. I mean, Not like in the book...that would be a sin...but I can get pretty darn close.
I might buy him a new bottle of lotion and tissues. Who knows?

6639656,4,B00NCDVVLY,"Though a few years late in viewing this immensely popular film and not having read E.L. James series of novels on dominant and submissive sexual experiences, the better late than never applies. No, this is not a great movie but as adapted for the screen by Kelly Marcel it is entertaining (though a bit long) and it is cast with credible appearing characters (the central focus couple spends the better part of the 125 minute film without clothes and pushing the usual standards of X rated to the limits  almost). Sam Taylor  Johnson, the British female director manages the situation well.

Shy literature student Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) rooms with the worldly Kate (Eloise Mumford) and goes to interview the wealthy Christian Grey  (Jamie Dornan) as a favor to Kate who is to interview Grey for the school paper. She encounters a beautiful, brilliant and intimidating man. The innocent and naive Ana starts to realize she wants him. Despite his enigmatic reserve and advice, she finds herself desperate to get close to him. Not able to resist Ana's beauty and independent spirit, Christian Grey admits he wants her too, but on his own terms. Ana hesitates as she discovers the singular tastes of Christian Grey - despite the embellishments of success, his multinational businesses, his vast wealth, and his loving family, Grey is consumed by the need to control everything. He gradually introduces (? seduces) into the realm of submission and dominance  and the film ends with a cliffhanger that guarantees the continuation of James novel.

Johnson and Dornan have fine chemistry and make the affaire noir credible. The others in the cast who contribute well are Jennifer Ehle (Anas mother), Marcia Gay Harden (Christians mother) and bit parts by Victor Rasuk, Max Martin and Luke Grimes among others.

Be prepared for a lot of visual body contact  but of course everyone knows the story and its reason for being because of all the flutter about James novels. Grady Harp, March 18",1520467200,,1992,4.978915662650603

6639717,1,B00NCDVVLY,"Ok I am know I am so late to this conversation, but I am compelled to share my thoughts. I am just floored right now how women everywhere fell in love with this!

My best friend suggested I watch 50-shades of grey because when she watches Christian Grey and his obsessive nature over Anastasia, always worried about her safety, it reminded her of how my husband is with me.  When this book was popular, I never had any interest in reading it, nor did I have any interest in watching the movies. But, yesterday I was home with a sick kid, so I decided to sit down and see what all the hoopla is about.

Who actually thought this was a good movie? What is the obsession with this? The only thing this has done is portray a controlling narcissistic sociopath as sexy? (I don't agree with this at all, but I am assuming this is the allure of the whole movie) And women everywhere went nuts over what? I am like literally sick to my stomach and I far from a goody two shoes, nor am I afraid of a man who has a challenged past. I am being told she ""changes him"" And I need to watch the next movie. For what????  Sir? Don't touch me, physically hurting her? (Yes I get some people get off on this type of pleasure, however, obviously she wasn't getting off from this from the end of the first one)

This has nothing to do with the sex. . .Sex is sex, some people have more colorful sex lives than others, this was all about control. I just cannot believe women actually paid to go see this and hailed this as a love story. . .Just dumbfounded right now. And for young girls who will watch this and think this type of control is sexy? There are insane controlling narcissistic sociopaths everywhere. This was showing women how it is ok to be controlled and it is acceptable and we should tolerate abusive relationships.  It shows how abuse is ok, because he ""loves"" her and although he ""hurts her"" he doesn't mean to, this is just the way he is. It also suggests that if you continue allowing your abuser to abuse you, if you continue loving and making excuses for him, he will quite possibly change because you stuck by his side regardless. However, this seldon happens in real life. I still can't believe how women love this. Very sad in my eyes. I would never want my daughter to watch this and think it is ok. This movie  glamorizes abuse and control. I am also so NOT a fem-nazi, but I must question the mind-frame of women after watching this movie. .

Yes, I get that this was just a movie, however, young people (and some adults) often fantasize and form true opinions of reality from what they watch and view in entertainment.

Wow, just wow. . . .",1518307200,4,2649,4.303212851405623

6639762,5,B00NCDVVLY,"After years of ignoring the hype about Fifty Shades of Grey, I finally read the book and didn't like it. I followed it up with the movie.  I liked the movie better than the book.  I've watched it a few times (and enjoyed it each time) so the repeat merits five stars.

The movie elicited from me what the book should have  furious heart beating, intensity, care for the characters, curiosity, intrigue. I like the sequel, Fifty Shades Darker too.  The cast is well chosen - Dakota Johnson in particular is perfect.  This is because she portrays a better-than-the-book version of her character Ana, who had many annoying tendencies in the book. Jamie Dornan is not as hard as I pictured Christian Grey to be, but he does a great job inhabiting his character too.  I did not find the book romantic, but the movie was well directed and produced so that the actors injected chemistry, warmth, attraction, heart and depth to the characters they played, giving the movie a more romantic atmosphere. The music is terrific; Seattle and Savannah are beautifully depicted.  The story is given a great over-all vibe I didn't feel in the book.

I watched the movie alone the first time (second time with my husband - who enjoyed it as well).  It's not something I could watch in a movie theatre surrounded by other people because of the nudity and explicit sex scenes.  So this DVD was perfect.  A guilty pleasure.",1516406400,,1402,4.654471544715447

Jamie Dornan is so terrified of Dakota Johnson - he doesn't inspire any sort of passion or intrigue at all. And Dakota is a unique actress but this just isn't her forte.

I don't like their character selection. Christian is just not hot enough in my opinion. I was thinking more muscular, but not unrealistically so. The stares he has in the books they talk about paint a different picture to me than what the movie has. Same goes for Annastasia. I was expecting someone else I guess? Hoping is more like it. I think the movie would have been much more appealing with different actors. Not to mention there didn't seem to be a lot of emotion. I thought it was much more mellow compared to the sexual tension in the book. Didnt feel it with the movie.",1514764800,,755,4.286713286713287
6639794,5,B00NCDVVLY,Excellent.  For me it was about that kind of love and passion where you just cannot seem to breath without the other one near.  It's the good girl falls for bad boy ( & vice versa) and her love helps him realize he is not the horrible person he thinks he is on the inside.  She helps him overcome the monsters in his head that were put there as a child.,1514764800,,353,3.943661971830986
6639795,5,B00NCDVVLY,"I watched without expectations, regardless of all the prior excitement from both readers and watchers. I really enjoyed the exploration of the hurt psyche and its manifestation as a sexual persuasion, which is where a lot of our hurts get displayed/channeled. One has to not be given so much to prudish thinking, preconceived notions and have an appreciation for all the aspects of humanity made evident.

6639798,2,B00NCDVVLY,"I do not know why this movie is so popular. Both of the main characters are not likeable. I could not understand how a person would want to subject themselves or allow themselves to being abused by someone else. On the other side it is bizarre how a person who supposedly cares for someone else could at the same time abuse them in a sado-masochistic manner. The male main character to me, even though rich, is unfeeling and controlling with issues. That would be a red flag in most people's minds. This is definitely not your typical love story. It is mostly a voyeuristic movie with intense sex scenes meant to titillate. In real life, I would feel sorry for a woman who is that naive to ""fall in love"" with this type of person. Not a pleasant movie to watch.",1514505600,,761,4.404255319148936

Throw in a couple of whip shots, a room with restraint devices, like most ppl think BSDM is as an attempt to be different, but fails to deliver. It didn't bloom organically, just robotic. No real characters, seems like a prolonged daydream for everyday Jane to be swept off feet by sexy billionaire who chases relentlessly.
Somewhat a rip off of the movie secretary but more bland, unsuccessful in building tension, yet commercially more successful due to farfetched fantasy and more relatable female lead.",1514073600,5,638,5.264705882352941

Writing was terrible and hated the way it portrayed the BDSM community but years later I watched the movie because I know sometimes film adaptations are not always the same as their book counterparts. I thought the plot was well developed and the emphasis on permission and showing the control a submissive can have in the relationship really came across in the film. If the author was going for this I don't feel like it was properly communicated. The movie did a much better job and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

6639883,1,B00NCDVVLY,"My friend got this for me for my birthday. Clearly lying to your friends about ""yeah, I read the book... It was okay."" Doesn't work well when they buy you the dvd. So I watched it. Popped some popcorn and grabbed a glass of wine. I remember why I put the book down in the first place. I had a boyfriend show the same frightening behavior as Christian Grey showed Ana. I had a boyfriend who wanted to know what I was doing 24/7. It's called an abusive relationship - I didn't know that until my boyfriend had his hands around my throat. FSOG isn't about love. It has nothing to do with love. It's degrading, and offensive to everyone whos ever experienced an abusive relationship. If your boyfriend or husband is exhibiting the same behavior, I urge you to get out now before its too late.

I read some of the reviews and was very surprised. Probably because I was married for 47 years to the love of my life and being from a country that the word sex was never spoken and definitely ""taboo""at 16 and 18 we knew nothing about it,except of course what we felt for each other.
So we bought a book.....and I'm delighted to say that we tried a lot of things that Anastasia and Christian did in this movie....lol....oh the memories.
Any way this movie is fantastic....I see it as a great love story that starts flourishing the first day they met when Anastasia falls flat on her face at Christian's office door. The look on their faces at that moment said it all. They played their parts to perfection.
Anastasia's love,patience and understanding became Christian's life-line.

I rented the movie because I had some respect for the director, miss Sam J-T . Obviously her husband passed the opportunity to play Grey.  Can't blame him .

A shy 21 year girl (Ana) who is just about to graduate from college, is forced to do an interview for her college newspaper with the extremely wealthy and handsome 27 year old Christian Grey. She meets Christian in his office and fumbles through the interview as she is distracted by his good  looks. As she becomes more relaxed, she starts challenging his answers to her questions and making comments that most people would not have the nerve to say to him. He finds this very refreshing  and challenging. By the end of the interview, they both feel an electrical attraction and try to ignore it but can't.

6640037,4,B00NCDVVLY,"I watched this movie out of curiosity because there was 1) so much hype about it 2) the reviews were awful and I had to know why. First I will say that I laughed at a LOT of things that happened in this movie, and there were only so many scenes that were good, I don't fault the actors/directing at all, but the writing is just off the wall and too unrealistic! It's a shame that this story was not better written, these fantasies are over the top and the idea that they took every possible FANTASY and put them into ONE movie was just silly, this is why I was laughing half the time. I'm laughing as I write this post, the billionaire boyfriend, the sweet innocent girl, ugh the list goes on and on. The chemistry between the actors was good, I imagine they had to do a lot of work to get those scenes right and for that I applaud them. As a side note, after watching Fifty Shades of Grey I heard about&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Secretary/dp/B00C2QUCBM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Secretary</a>&nbsp;which was released in 1999, a lot of the lines and even the main character was copied from Secretary into Fifty Shades of Grey.

The acting is a joke.  Both leads come across as little kids playing dress up.  There is zero chemistry between them, and well...she is just awful.  Very immature sounding and just awful.  He's certainly not much better with his attempting to be a 'big man' on the screen.

6640090,1,B00NCDVVLY,"** contains spoilers**

This movie is advertised as a thrilling, unconventional romance that helps Ana release her dark desires.  Sounds liberating, except Christian tries to dominate all aspects of their relationship, so its actually oppressive.  Although the contract he writes up supposedly proves he respects her limits, he doesnt show her much respect at all.

For example, when she expresses concerns about being beaten, he dismisses her concerns, telling her shell like itas if he knows her better than she knows herself.  When she doesnt sign the contract fast enough, he pressures her to hurry up and takes her into his special room anyway.  And when she breaks up with him, he breaks into her house!

Another example of his disrespect is when she announces shes visiting her mom and he reacts possessively, claiming she belongs to him and needs his permission.  When she goes anyway, he follows her and distracts her into only paying attention to him.

All this possessive behavior --- breaking and entering, stalking, isolating  is sexy?  Whats sexy about treating a human being like a doll thats supposed to look pretty, but not move or speak its mind (she gets a spanking for asking a question)?  Is it sexy because hes rich and can afford a gilded cage to store her in?

Anas behavior, though not as outrageous as Christians, is also controlling.  It seems shes only participating in this lifestyle to get Christian to change his sexual preference to match hers.  Shes like someone agreeing to an open relationship with the agenda of changing it to a monogamous one.

I didn't see this story as sexy or liberating.  I saw it as two incompatible people trying to change each other. The ending was confusing, too.  Ana asks Christian to beat her as hard as he can and when he complies, shes offended he could do such a thing.  I do appreciate Christian self-reflecting in parts, but theres not enough of it.",1497312000,,1919,4.831288343558282

Upon contacting the settler on this issue the only thing they advised was to adjust the contrast. I advised I had but would do it again and would advised them again. Upon letting them know there was no changed I've had no response, contact, solution, resolution forward working on resolving the matter nor have I even received any type of response back period since my last email advising there was no change and the darkness was so bad & black I couldn't even watch the movie the entire way through. Now so far I'm just out that money with a movie I can't even watch. I've never had a problem with any of my purchases from Amazon in the past and I order from there a lot!

6640140,5,B00NCDVVLY,"Wow. So good. Can't even begin to describe how surprised I was by this. These two are relatively unknown actors, and their performance was just amazing. As a fan of the books (yes you should read all four of the books before attempting to pass judgement.) as a fan of the books, I was gratified to see that they didn't deviate too much from the original plot line. I am the first to admit that the first book in the four book series seemed to be written very immaturely (as far as a romance type novel goes) I love romance novels and have been reading them for the last twenty years. If you can grit your teeth and get through the first book, you will be very happy with how the subsequent books in the series play out.
Getting back to the actors;
On screen chemistry was unmistakable. I'd be interested to learn how many takes the first ""office"" scene took to perfect as it's spot on. I feel both of the actors put in an oscar worthy performance with this first scene alone.
Throughout the movie I found myself drawn more and more into their story. Had I not first read the books in may have been completely lost, confused, and annoyed by the seeming lack of romance. But having read the books especially ""grey"" it all made much more sense.
I suggest you read the first fifty shades title, then read grey, then go back and watch the movie.",1495497600,12,1340,4.342629482071713

6640221,1,B00NCDVVLY,"If you read the books and loved them like me, you expected so much more out of this movie than was given. First may I start by pointing out that although movies do leave out the occasional part here or there to move the story along, this one allowed so many parts to be skipped that you use no true earthly idea what's going on or why anything is happening the way it does. (While reading at least.) There was no warmth between the characters whatsoever. They acted as though every tough was awkward and forced painfully. The scene in which Ana leaves Christian is my biggest let down. He acts like ice. The good readers know how much it tore him to pieces and her too! This whole movie was in the wrong order, lacking too much, no warmth or depth within the two lead roles, you didn't see the staff, you didn't get everything that you were supposed to. If you actually enjoyed this, I'm so sorry to tell you how much ""More"" it could've been for you. Readers keep on reading.

6640234,1,B00NCDVVLY,"How could I rate this movie? Many people say the movie wasn't near as good as the book. I am inclined to agree! The movie, like so many other rented Amazon movies, jumped, skipped, and dropped audio on a regular basis;; I don't recall blank pages in the book and missing paragraphs. and long sections of empty pages.

With a high-end, low latency, non throttled, high bandwidth  170 Mb/sec download stream (20 Mb/sec upload) with QoS settings on max, with which allow me to watch a steaming 4K movie (on industry leader, Netflix without a problem on three separate accounts in two disparate locations, which are 700 miles apart, it is obvious where the problem exists. Each account and location, are serviced by 100 to 200 MBA/sec, low latency hardware. Each location is capable of playing a 4K  Netflix movie with 5.1 surround sound on higher end video/audio equipment.  As I travel frequently between both locations, I noticed a commonality: the second and third tier films included at no extra cost play well without any typical consumer recognizable problems other than a few unnecessary and irrelevant DRM issues that only Amazon has determined are ""troublesome,"" when played on certain devices. No big deal.

As a loyal Amazon Prime customer and semi-evangelist, I highly recommend Amazon Prime membership to anyone who can afford the annual  $100 fee to enjoy discount prices and shipping upgrades which are competitive with so many other online retail distributors who have the benefit of brick and mortar stores, and who seem to be more than willing to match Amazon Prime prices if you are willing to ask!. Stores like B&H, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, Guitar Center, Sam Ash, and many other stores need only for me to bring up the Amazon price on my iPhone, and they'll match the price. The benefit of Amazon Prime is not having to go to all of these stores, and wait for a manager to green light the transaction. The shipping is fast, and the tracking services? Impeccable There is a convenience offered by Amazon Prime that gives it true value.

That they offer ancillary benefits, such as streaming movies as part of the paid membership makes them one of the least expensive online streaming movie services at $8.50/month. This includes a yet I investigated Amazon Prime music service which offers members musical selections.

Where does it go wrong? In my experience, along with many others who work, or have worked, in the streaming multimedia industry, renting a more relevant film from Amazon: one not offered as part of their Prime membership is a risk. Notably, half of the time, regardless of the quality and meticulous tuning of one's own hardware and top-tier Internet service, it has been my experience, one echoed by others, that within the 24 hours you are allowed to view the 90 to 120-minute streaming HD video once you have started watching it, ""technical difficulties,"" render the movie unwatchable. I was told, after multiple transfers to various departments, that given the popularity of some (two to ten-year-old) movies, the servers are ""overloaded."" As if it were my fault for choosing to give $4.52 to Amazon  to receive a shoddy product!

Fifty Shades of Grey may very well be a great movie, a mediocre movie or a horrible movie. I wouldn't know. I rented it from Amazon. Tried to watch it three times, rebooted everything, and switched to Netflix and watched ""The Good Son."" It was a good psychological thriller. Better yet, it played, from beginning to end, without interruption.

My review of Amazon's HD streaming version of, ""Fifty Shades of Grey?"" I have not yet seen the entire film. Perhaps when it makes its way to Amazon Prime or Netflix, U'll let you know! Caveat emptor!

the sex scenes were ok, so if that is all you're looking for.. meh.  I'd still probably suggest going to find some real porn or maybe a better romance novel.

The rest of the movie was just cringe worthy.  terrible dialogue, one dimensional characters, stunted scenes, and a controlling relationship. Overall, it just isn't a story i'm on board for.  I read the books back in their heyday, and to be honest i think the movie gives the abuse claims a lot more validity than the books ever did.

I went with 2 stars instead of 1 because I do genuinely think this is better than the book (even with the abuse, which says quite a bit about the entire franchise), and I think the actors did a good job with what they had to work with.

6640331,5,B00NCDVVLY,"I know that there are a lot of people that have a lot of problems with this movie but I'll be honest - I love it. Stop over-analyzing everything and stop taking it so seriously. Watch the movie with an open mind and just try to enjoy it.

This movie is a big improvement from the book (which I read and thought was just ok). Yes, Dakota Johnson is almost unbearably awkward as Anastasia, Eloise Mumford (Ana's roommate, Kate) is annoying with her perpetually red and know-it-all face, and sometimes Jamie Dornan's Irish accent slips through. I have somehow found a way to look passed these faults (and a few others) and truly enjoy watching this movie.

If you liked the Twilight books/movies and don't mind a few (or a bunch of) sex scenes, you'll probably enjoy this movie too. It's fun to find all of the parallels between the two series - the plot, the characters, etc.

I think there are a lot of reasons to hate this movie, but if you take it for what it is (a Twilight fanfiction turned movie) I think that you, like me, could find this movie funny and entertaining.",1489968000,4,1073,4.436548223350254

6640409,3,B00NCDVVLY,"I haven't read the book ""Fifty Shades of Grey"". I took one look at the page count and wondered how a bodice-ripper could drag on for 500 pages. But, curious to know what all the fuss was about, I saw the movie. This is a soft-core porn flick for the ladies. In some respects, it hearkens to the tradition of bringing exploitation cinema to big audiences using big budgets, A-list actors, and clever scripts. Steven Spielberg and George Lucas built empires this way, and the occasional cut-above horror flick finds popular success. ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" isn't of that caliber, though. It doesn't elevate the genre. It spends most of its time on a goofy narrative, hokey dialogue, and boasts about 15 minutes of sex with a running time of just over 2 hours.

Anastasia ""Ana"" Steele (Dakota Johnson) is a college senior about to graduate with a degree in English Literature, when she is asked by her roommate Kate Kavanagh (Eloise Mumford) to interview the handsome billionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) for the student newspaper, as Kate has fallen ill. In spite of being the ""world's most eligible billionaire bachelor"", the public knows next to nothing about Mr. Grey's personal life. Anastasia is a little shy and too bohemian for his spotless offices, and the interview proceeds awkwardly. But Mr. Grey is charmed by her and makes an excuse to see Anastasia again. She finds him charming but is both attracted to and repulsed by Mr. Grey's controlling nature, which she only begins to understand when he asks her to be his submissive.

Nothing the characters do makes much sense. Mr. Grey is not a real man but a total feminine fantasy, specifically E.L. James' fantasy. The dialogue is often preposterously bad. These people could not logically be attracted to one another. Ana takes half the movie to decide if she wants to sign a contract. The movie was made in 2015, yet everyone uses a flip phone. These things won't matter to the movie's intended audience. Mr. Grey is hot. The sex is sexy. That's all this movie is trying to do. Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson are good at making bad dialogue seem reasonable enough to advance the plot to the next scene, at least. And they look good.

There have been questions raised about how BDSM is depicted, whether Christian and Anastasia's relationship is abusive, etc. Mr. Grey's insistence that he only relate to women through contractual dominant-submissive relationships is portrayed as a pathological way of coping with childhood trauma. That's because the narrative is traditional romance. The heroine must save her man from himself in order to find love. So he must have a pathology, preferably a kinky one. Ana wants Christian to change, but isn't the thing she wants to change the very thing that attracts her? ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" is one person's fantasies strung together by whatever plot elements she could come up with. It's not helpful to say it isn't authentic or the relationship isn't healthy. It's fantasy.",1488326400,,2981,4.875739644970414
6640410,4,B00NCDVVLY,"Never got to see this at the theatre and after some of the reviews wasn't sure I wanted to, but since the next one's due out (50 Shades Greyer) I decided to rent the first.  Have to agree with most of the original reviews...Dakota Johnson was pretty good and convincing but Jamie Dornan was a bit stiff and unconvincing in the beginning of the movie.  I do think he improved some as the movie moved along so I'm hoping he'll be even better in the second one.  That being said....the movie deviates some from the book (obviously they couldn't include all of it).  Some elements were combined or not presented exactly the same or presented in a different time frame, but overall the theme and plot of the story are true to the book.",1488326400,,730,4.425373134328358

6640422,3,B00NCDVVLY,"Okay, so I have watched this movie twice, two years apart, and have two very distinct experiences.

The first time I watched the movie was when I had just completed reading the book series, and while I liked the music even then, outside of the music, the movie was a 2 star experience.

It just did not live up to the book series. Or more specifically, Jamie Dornan could not match the Christian Grey persona. Though I must say that Dakota Johnson was the perfect pick for Anastasia Steele.

However, I watched it again now, in anticipation of the second movie Fifty Shades Darker, and I must say that I liked it a whole lot better. I am not really sure why, but I guess, I possibly have grown used to idea of Dornan as Grey and the details of the book have become hazy in my mind.

Anyway, all in all, Round 2 was much better than Round 1 for this movie.

6640425,2,B00NCDVVLY,"Never read the books, but I saw the second film and I can tell you that, it was better then this one. And yes I too watched  just out of curiosity and wanted to know what the hype was about. in my opinion if they had cast a much more (beautiful ) girl then I wouldn't have  thought it would be considered such  a big blockbuster and really never answers the question of - what's the big hoopla about this movie, Johnson's character was absolutely boring but Christian was amazing .",1488067200,,481,4.263736263736264
6640426,5,B00NCDVVLY,"I'm giving it five stars for the quality and accessibility, which, Amazon excels at, but the storyline is pretty ridiculous. That being said it's a great campy escape. You can make fun of it with a friend or simply zone out on it and let it wash over your troubled brain and take you into a world where lust at first sight with a young billionaire turns into an extremely bizarre patriarchal exploration of bad romantic choice making. It has a great soundtrack though.",1488067200,,468,4.583333333333333
6640427,4,B00NCDVVLY,"This movie really surprised me. I initially avoided it because it was said to be ""abusive"" and all about kinky sex, but it's not. Really it is a love story based upon a man with a not so good past. He lives the way he knows and keeps love and emotions at a distance to protect himself (the control he speaks of, including contracts..he is a man of business after all), but when he begins to fall in love with Ana, he starts to break his own rules and the walls he's built around himself slowly and reluctantly begin to crumble. He does practice BDSM (dominant and submissive sexual practice) which many people may be uncomfortable with, BUT it is not abusive and every bit of it is consensual, including an emotional scene where he lashes her with a belt. It is best to watch the movie/read the book to understand why this takes place, and if you're strongly against such behavior, this is not for you. The woman absolutely is the one who is in control and walks away when she wants to, every time. In fact, it is her ability to walk away and say what she likes and doesn't like which begins to peel away at Christian's layers (hence the title)...he is the one who is vulnerable. This is like a grown-up fairy tale about love. Only this time it's definitely not the damsel in distress.",1488067200,,1285,4.380753138075314

6640446,2,B00NCDVVLY,"I'm ashamed to say I rented this for some light entertainment of cheesy romance and kinky sex with a lady friend.  Unfortunately, it pretty much fails to deliver on both counts.  There are almost zero naughty love scenes-- I think there must be less than 60 seconds total.  We're all adults here; why is Hollywood so gun shy?

On the romance side, not much of anything happens.  Whereas in the book there is a sense of adventure and fun, in this watered-down adaptation, the characters could not care less about each other, and hardly even kiss.  I think my parents would be mildly titillated watching this.

PROS: You can tell the actors are having a good time playing crazy characters, and overall the acting, camera work, and sound are infinitely higher quality than in a daytime soap.",1487635200,2,788,4.708029197080292

Second, as a married woman for quite some time I found none of Christian's toys all that shocking. Third, I watched this movie only to see if the scenes were enough to, in the immortal words of The Rolling Stones, start me up.

There was very little to no chemistry between the leads. I actually watched the first ten to fifteen minutes. I laughed. A lot. As I did when some of the more serious sex scenes were watched (which I fast forwarded too because watching painfully bad acting simply required more patience than I had).

Don't waste your time unless this kind of stuff is new and exciting to you. Even then, this film is a joke and about as bad as the books.",1486771200,,809,4.3509933774834435

I did not read the book but in this portrayal Anna just wants a normal loving intimate relationship, and she gets a cold, distant, stalkerish, and abusive guy instead.  Are the gifts and extravagant outings supposed to make up for it?  They really don't.  It just makes him seem even more manipulative.  I really hate this movie.

You can tell everyone involved in the production cared about making the movie as close to the book as possible. Now I know there were people who saw this movie and didn't read the book and they find it to be over the  top but it's a movie based on romance novel. Fifty is not greatest book ever written but it was a fun read and I found the movie fun too.  Also, it is not the greatest movie ever but so what! It is romance and escapism. Trust me we could all use both of those things considering what's going on in the world. I for one can't wait until Fifty Shades Darker.",1486598400,26,726,4.06993006993007

I can not believe the hype around this movie or the sequel. The plot was ridiculous. The dialog was awful. It's as if a teenager took every single cliche line from a Rom-Com and built a script around them and thought it sounded professional. There was not one aspect of this movie that saved it.

No joke, it looks like someone took the movie case and coarsely rubbed it on the sidewalk. I open the movie case, and chunks/flakes of plastic from the case fall onto my lap. What?

My overwhelming feeling was sadness that both characters, having finally found someone they wanted, worked so hard to meet in the middle & still didn't get there.

As an adult who's in a healthy relationship, I can appreciate the movie for what it is. However, if you're wondering if this is an okay movie for a young, impressionable female or male to watch- it's not. If this were real life, this would be a man you'd want to run far away from.

However, the movie did her character justice.  It made her seem innocent, yes which he character is, but also funny, a little kooky, and also stronger in her ways more so than the book.

6640637,5,B00NCDVVLY,"Although the subject is highly controversial, I found this movie's treatment of a difficult topic extremely sensitive and well-done.  Extremely sensuous, of course, but also exceptionally tasteful, which is rare in this genre - normally, you feel like you're rooting through a garbage can looking for interesting treatments of the genre subject, but certainly not the case in this film.  I thought the key actor performances were excellent, although some of the side actors/roles seemed shallow and painfully predictable.  Definitely not for every viewer, but I found it fascinating.",1486166400,2,583,5.52808988764045

The  Twilight book was poorly written as well.  I only read this to see what all the fuss was about and I was very disappointed.  Don't waste your money...,1485561600,,451,4.451219512195122

6640743,1,B00NCDVVLY,"I was so bored that I decided to watch this just to see what the fuss was all about, and boy am I glad I did...I haven't laughed so hard in quite a while! This POS was ridiculous, especially in all the hilarious contradictions, many of which were 180 degrees out of phase with a key element to hte plot. Mr. Grey doesn't ""make love,"" he tells the young ingenue, he ""f's...hard."" And yet, for some reason which is not explained, he temporarily sets aside his lifestyle as a freako-pervert to tenderly deflower her, once he learns that she still had her virtue. He doesn't share his bed for sleeping purposes either...except on those occasions when he does...lol Another one of his central tenets that gets conveniently set aside, again, for reasons to which the viewer is not privy. He also insists on having his willing ""victims"" (my word, not his) sign a contract before volunteering to be his sex toy as he indulges his demented perversions which take place in his ""play room,"" except, yet again, on those times when he doesn't.

There's little suspense, not that this is a suspense movie, because you can see everything coming a mile away, and not just because the book was a big seller. It's just the typical lazy, uninspired, hack Hollywood writing, full of the usual shopworn plot devices in movies like this. And yes, we've seen this basic thing before, many times. The freako-pervert thing is just a gimmick to distract you from the fact that there truly is nothing new under the sun. And supposedly they're going to string this garbage out for another two movies? LOL! GMAFB... Please people, don't be suckers. Even if you like suggestively kinky soft-core porny types of movies, THIS WASN'T VERY GOOD AT ALL! It simply fails to deliver. Perhaps we should actually be glad of that.

The girl is cast well enough, I suppose, but the joker who plays the self-indulgent rich boy is laughable, and makes Charlie McCarthy look less wooden by comparison (web search that reference if you must, at least it will keep you away from this stinker of a movie for a while longer). If you must watch it, do as I did and indulge yourself in the unintentional laughs. Too bad they couldn't have just left the way it ended as THE END, PERIOD, because not only would it spare us two more pieces of this garbage, but such an ending would make far more sense than having the formerly sweet young thing coming back to Mr. Freako-Pervert for more.",1485475200,,2435,4.621247113163972

It's fun to watch their chemistry, the steamy scenes and the rest of the cast who could really pass for inconsequential.

6640836,2,B00NCDVVLY,"Disclaimer: Yes, I get it. The books aren't classic literature and they condone unhealthy relationships (psychological/physical abuse). The BDSM community isn't happy with the portrayal of their world.

But if you're able to put that aside and try to enjoy the movie, well, you're out of luck. I'm not under any misguided notions, I know books and movie versions are gonna differ a little. But come on!

After watching ""The Fall,"" I thought Jamie Dornan was a fantastic choice. But his character in the movie seemed to fall flat. If they would have made Dornan's character more like the serial killer in ""The Fall,"" I think they would have been a lot closer to what the character is like in the book. And Dakota Johnson, well, I'm not sure. Her acting also seemed to lack some of the emotion I perceived from the books. She plays the innocent part really well but with the emotional range/expression of a goldfish. Only one of their ""steamy"" scenes was close to what I would have imagined.

All that said, this is simply my perception. Maybe other people thought it was better and actually fit the characters from books. But I think they could have done better. Especially since the soundtrack was packed with some groovy tunes.",1484870400,,1228,4.755868544600939

I read the book afterwards, as I usually do, and this movie is a wonderful companion to the book. There are, as usual slight deviations from the book, which is normal because of time restraints. I think they did well picking actors/actresses for the movie. Grey seems insecure with Anastasia and controlling which is how he is in the book. Ana,  in my eyes, was perfect. She is described in the book as not being the classic beauty and shes a book enthusiast. I think Dakota played the part very well and she's not TOO beautiful, even though she is beautiful.. to be the perfect Anastasia. Oh and I love the soundtrack!!",1484697600,,741,4.4411764705882355

His actions are the  opposite of his philosophical being because he's in love.  It's a wonderful love story with a twist. Anastasia is really the controlling one.  She doesn't quite know it in the beginning.  Watched how Christian is dictated by her responses and her actions.  In the beginning,  they are both in the dark by their philosophies, yet still receptive to one another.  I've read and watched the story and trilogy well over the allowed limits.

6641009,2,B00NCDVVLY,"The movie's just so so and I'm not super thrilled with how they ended it. I guess since there are 3 books to cover, the ending makes sense, and I never did finish the first book since the characters were a bit unbelievable. Not too crazy about the actor they chose for Christian either - just didn't fit the description from the book and the acting isn't that great. And then the subject matter - BDSM. Most people think of that as rather kinky and kinda wild, yet the movie was pretty tame in the way they portrayed the sex scenes. Not that I would expect porn or anything but it was pretty mediocre & not too believable in my opinion...",1483488000,,638,4.2809917355371905

6641016,1,B00NCDVVLY,"Enjoyed the books, but this was painful.  Better left as text.  The acting is beyond wooden from both main characters.  I'm sure Dakota Johnson is a lovely person but she was not right for this role physically and every line is delivered in the same monotone.  Same regards to Dornan...he's just not the physical presence that this character required.  NO CHEMISTRY between these two.  Thank goodness it only cost me $2.99!",1483401600,,423,4.887323943661972

She's awkward, intelligent, virginal, strained parental relationship, works in a hardware store

I thought this was supposed to be erotica.  I guess I don't really know what erotica is supposed to be, but I didn't think it was the same thing as soft porn. I expected there to be more substance to the story. Instead, it was sex scene after sex scene with way too many booby shots.

I found the movie unsexy due to the lack of chemistry between the actors. Also, since I didn't read the book, I felt confused the whole time.

The most confusing part was the end. She tells him she wants the worst of his fantasy, so he spanks her. She did not appear to be in any real pain. She didn't cry out. She did not tell him to stop even though she had that choice. She counted each whack as she was instructed. When he is done, she freaks out and leaves because he ""hurt"" her. That was the end.

6641130,5,B00NCDVVLY,"What can you say, after reading all three books and then to see the movie, the first installment of the trilogy.  I think without a doubt they did a wonderful job.  I think i have watched the movie over l00 times and have read the three books just as many times.  In a sense it was a fairytale but with characters that could have been you or me.  Dakota and Jamie did such a good job portraying the characters,everytime I see or hear about the book or movie I can envisionlize them as being the true characters of the movie and books.  I can't get over how much it seem so real and so convincing that  two different people could show each other the light.  He showed her the light of becoming a woman and not having self esteem problems and she showed him that he was a beautiful person insided and out and no matter what he went through as a child he could start a new life with her in the light. You kept hearing about that there was no chemistry, the chemistry was there even though the sex in the movie was toned down more so that it was in the book.  It was done tastefully.  I would recommend this movie to anyone, you will enjoy it and your will want to see it over and over again.  I can't wait until Fifty shades darker and Fifty shades freed come to the screen,I'll be there and so will many others.",1481932800,12,1309,4.138339920948616

There is nothing sadder in our society than promoting and forgiving domestic abusers. This story and the books do nothing to an enhance equality of two people in a relationship. Rather, there is a glorification that a man who abuses is ok if he is only abusing to make you ""feel good"" via his interpretation of making love. His control and manipulation of a woman into a relationship with him shows that narcissism is ok. It shows that love is ok if expressed through sociopathy. And, it shows that a woman to a powerful, financially successful man with complete control, is only an object with which he can mold. There is nothing humane about this storyline. It is not even porn, or soft-core porn. This movie is approving abuse and control.",1481500800,2,795,4.726618705035971

6641246,2,B00NCDVVLY,"I was so disappointed in this movie. The actors held back too much to make their feelings believable, the delivery was stilted. I never really believed he had feelings. The books are tremendously better...some of the scenes that were left out were important to their relationship and some of the changes didn't keep the characters in mind. A red car? He would never let her have a red car. She rolled her eyes on camera maybe once? It was an important part of her independence. He barely meets Ray, but Ray's feelings are important for her. If you're gonna keep 'laters, baby,' we needed more Elliott and Kate, because the lines aren't even delivered with the excess the book implies. We see Christian smile and look carefree once, in the back of the glider, and he returns to his stiffness. We don't really get a sense of what she sees in him, other than chemistry.

I don't blame the actors...they're better in everything else they do, I blame directing. Let them breathe! Let them feel! We get a few scenes of Ana's playful innocence, but her peeks inside of Christian's little boy charm are just non existent. It's ok, Ana. You can do better.",1479513600,2,1146,4.617647058823529

After that, the movie is okay, Half of the entertainment value for the books, IMHO is the characters she has in her head. There's no way to show that, altho it would have been interesting to have little cartoon characters to make comments. Some of the things she thinks are hilarious.

I don't adore the film for the simulated sex, but for the realistic exploration of Anastasia's psyche *by* Anastasia. I also admire the approach by a female writer of understanding this particular male dominant's motives for doing what he does and for making the chemistry between Ana and Christian so compelling. Casting two fairly new (to U.S. viewers) major-screen actors who are related to famous actors is magic in itself, but it also lends to creating a distance between viewer and screen action that permits the viewer to hang onto every bit of intimacy without a bit of guilt.

6641420,5,B00NCDVVLY,"This movie was greatly made in many ways. Its well directed and edited film. The story flows very well and is interesting almost every minute. Each scene was done with so much detail and social accuracy of human interaction, emotional, intellectual and sexual. The background music and theme songs are phenomenal and blend into the scenes very well and intensifies its emotions.

There are almost ten theme songs, which shows how the producers and directors wanted have taken this movie to their heart and soul. The movie definitely makes you briefly live in the story while watching and may make you think about it for while after leaving the theater.

The female lead role, played by Dakota Johnson, goes through wide range of emotions. Dakota Johnson did so well, in every emotion, that is just amazing. Dakota Johnson did full justice to the story and efforts being made by whole movie staff. She is just phenomenal, in both simple and very serious emotional scenes. If you observe careful, she is almost perfect in every facial expression and body language. The real beauty is how accurate her face expressions are during simple scenes and conversations.

The male lead actually did phenomenally well in some scenes, which could have easily gone unnoticed. Over all he did reasonably well.

Anyway great movie end of the day.",1475193600,,1330,4.95067264573991

As a parent I would hope that my children wouldn't get into this type of reading or movie till they are 21,  and have more life experiences to be able to put this type of knowledge into perspective. But I know that a much younger crowd was eating this series up. While I'm not a prude, I am a parent and I just don't think a child younger than 21 has the experience or knowledge of life to deal with issues like this without being harmed or scathed in some way.

This isn't a kid movie or a under 18 movie that is for sure, I learned about a few things myself that I never knew. This isn't as bad as some make it sound it is enlightening in a different frame of mind in which some people enjoy to have in their lives. Not me though.

The book does a much better job and also, in the book, you actually realize that this relationship is DIFFERENT than what he has had before....it is a LOVE story, not a SEX story, and I don't think people get that in the movie. Plus you couldn't really understand  the ending since she really didn't experience the experience that the book puts forth. All-in-all....it doesn't live up to the book and I would really recommend reading that first and watching the movie simply as an enhancement.",1473465600,5,655,4.598290598290598

I had no attachment to the characters. Ana, spoke like she was suffering from a nasal ailment -- Dakota Johnson is not the right person for the part.

Jamie Dornan looks good but he is no Christian Grey!

I watched this when it premiered in South Africa on Valentine's Day - what a waste of good money *Sigh*

My poor husband was dragged in to watch it because I raved about the books - he told me I should re-evaluate my sense of ""cringe-worthy""...

I suggest you read the book - you will not be disappointed..",1473120000,,600,4.36936936936937

6641535,5,B00NCDVVLY,"This movie was greatly made in many ways.  Its well directed and edited film.  The story flows very well and is interesting almost every minute.  Each scene was done with so much detail and social accuracy of human interaction, emotional, intellectual and sexual.  The background music and theme songs are phenomenal and blend into the scenes very well and intensifies its emotions.

There are almost ten theme songs, which shows how the producers and directors wanted have taken this movie to their heart and soul.  The movie definitely makes you briefly live in the story while watching and may make you think about it for while after leaving the theater.

The female lead role, played by Dakota Johnson, goes through wide range of emotions.  Dakota Johnson did so well, in every emotion, that is just amazing.  Dakota Johnson did full justice to the story and efforts being made by whole movie staff. She is just phenomenal, in both simple and  very serious emotional scenes.  If you observe careful, she is almost perfect in every facial expression and body language.  The real  beauty is how accurate her face expressions are during simple scenes and conversations.

The male lead actually did phenomenally well in some scenes, which could have easily gone unnoticed.  Over all he did reasonably well.

Anyway great movie end of the day.",1472947200,,1342,4.95067264573991

i loved the movie and tells a few good stories,
you get to see some bondage and nudity in the movie, but its fitting for the moment
there is a request thats made by the main actor in the movie, if you see the movie
you ill find out what it is and the big question is, will , it ever be carried out!!
i heard they were making a second part to this,but it would be under a different name,
i am not sure about it, but if it's true, i would love to see it !
will it continue where this show left off?

I thought it was quite interesting & found Ana's perspective on S&M realistic. Besides the nudity (more so Ana's), I don't think it is as vulgar as is being implied & stated - if both parties were equally nude, i.e. full frontal nudity for Grey & not just Ana, then the level of vulgarity it was hyped up to would be warranted (in my opinion). Overall, a good movie for adults, but then again, it is all about perspective & as with all things, common sense does apply (especially when it comes to control).",1471219200,,618,4.245762711864407

6641675,2,B00NCDVVLY,"I watched the film as research for a presentation I'm doing on rape myth acceptance, specifically how violent sex is considered hot sex, etc.. Yeah, Yeah... I know what you're thinking. ""Research."" What I was most interested in understanding was the relationship dynamic between these two characters outside of the sex. I have read all three novels and while we can see a lot of Christian's manipulation and signs of intimate partner violence in the books, we also see Ana make excuses and ultimately forgive a lot of his behavior because of admissions he makes about his past. Now, in the book, these admissions were a bargaining chip delivered after sex, but in the film, Christian's primary admission about his mother was made while Ana was asleep. She didn't even get to learn of his horrible childhood that shaped his character. So, without knowing that information, or really much knowing anything about him, she claims in the movie that she loves him. BASED ON WHAT? So, I feel like the movie makes a lot of assumptions about it's audience, mostly that they have read the books and can insert the plot for themselves. Whoopie. As a stand-alone product, the film is not great. If I wanted to see two people going at it, that's was porn is for and it's free. I hope the next film gives more insight into the characters and provides fewer sex scenes. If this is a love story, then tell me the story. Make me care about these people. Just showing me them having sex doesn't a relationship make.",1469664000,2,1497,4.674242424242424

After all the hype (and my own curiosity) I decided to by this and 100% regretted it once I went through it and really felt that I wasted my money. I will start with the good: the movie is shot very well and looks really clean and good. As for the bad: I feel the movie came across as a cheap 80's style soft-core porn that was obviously (and cleverly) aimed at a female audience.

In the end I think this was the main issue: the movie was not aimed at me which is why I did not enjoy it but I can easily see why women would enjoy this a lot.

It was one of those rare instances where the movie was actually better than the book (a book that is poorly written fan fiction of Twilight no less). I'm SO glad the left out the ""inner goddess"". Adding that would have made this movie more like Lizzie McGuire than an actual drama.

Still not wild about the borderline abusive relationship aspect.

But if you're in the mood for mind numbing movie with decent sex scenes with acting that is okay, this is the movie for you.

I'm not sure about the actor for the Christian character, though.  He wasn't as intense as he should have been.  Hopefully, the the next movie, he will be more dominant.

6641799,1,B00NCDVVLY,"So many people recommended this movie to me and I am now questioning my choice in friends.

I never read the books as the terrible cast they put on the BDSM community and how Grey ignores safe words, the writing is like a 12 year old tried to write sex, etc. Terrible, but this is about the move not the book. I was dubious about the move due to the horrific nature of the book. So many people told me, it's better than the book, it's better for the BDSM community, seriously, just watch it. From now on movies and books will be on the level of abortion in things I want to speak about with this person.

I have wasted money, time, and so many of my brain cells on this movie. The plot is beyond simple, not in any way captivating and above all sincerely painful. I would much rather have been whipped than watch this movie. If I could go back in time and the only way to stop myself from watching it was to kill myself, I'd truly consider it. I cannot fathom where people are coming up with these stellar reviews? I feel like the only purpose of this movie is give sad people a misplaced hope that some rich man will fall in love with them and give you a terrible BDSM relationship. Why?

I liked it! It's romantical, funny, dramatic, and of course, very sexy! (Duh!) I felt like it was as classy as house-wife BDSM can be, I guess? Basically, nothing in it was overtly shocking or off-putting. The actors did a great job reeling me in, and I fully believed the love story.  Probably one of the more unusual and interesting romantic movies I've seen in a while.  Biggest tips?

6641869,2,B00NCDVVLY,"After all the stir this movie created at every part of production and distribution I was expecting something much better. There is a little story in there but mostly it's the Gray character being a pushy dick. If I wanted to watch an over controlling a$$hole push an insecure woman into sex, I'd go hang out at a frat house. Both my GF and I just looked at each other after expecting so much more. If you want to watch, good luck. I just think it feel far short of the hype that surrounded it. There was a lot of nudity though, maybe that was the ""shocking"" part? I still don't get it",1466294400,2,584,4.176991150442478

6641909,2,B00NCDVVLY,"The movies was just as bad as the book. The plot is ridiculous, boring and unimaginative. The author overindulges into sexual descriptions and sadomasochistic practices that bore the reader to death. The main protagonists have no chemistry and the actors chosen to play them have no emotions and are as exciting as cardboard cutouts. A complete waste of money and talent on this venture and I definitely don't recommend such mediocre movie whom surprisingly many hailed as a success. It's still a great mystery to me why the book on which this movie was based was so successful being sold. I would never put it on the best seller list in a million years. This movie and the book belong in a dustbin.",1465689600,,699,4.691056910569106

The other day I was watching TV and flipping through the movie channels and caught sight of Fifty Shades of Grey. It was only 4 mins in, I came in on the part where Anastasia is being let into Christian Greys office, immediately that scene captured my attention. This movie had me hooked from beginning to end. Dakota and Jamie nailed their characters. They really did an amazing job making me a fan. So much so, I want to read the books and definitely can not wait until the next

6641925,5,B00NCDVVLY,This movie is outstanding! As a huge fan of the book series this movie definitely held its own. It was unique and didn't follow the story to a T but did enough to satisfy my hopes in what this movie would be.

6641928,4,B00NCDVVLY,"We watched this movie in the theater, then on Blu-ray, and then the director's cut.  We didn't notice anything different about the director's cut from the other versions of the movie.  I don't know if I'm alone, but I'm not a fan of the casting of Dakota Johnson.  The role is supposed to be this girl-next-door type girl that a billionaire is infatuated with.  I just think that they could have done a better job portraying that.  I don't see what Christian Grey sees I guess (but if I did, I guess I'd be worth billions).  There are a few things in the movie that may be unclear unless you've read the books.  We're looking forward to the next movie regardless.",1465344000,2,663,4.429752066115703

Yeah, I know what you are thinking.  It is the same for me.  It needed these kinds of characters to make the story hold it's own but makes it less relatable.  The movie was decent made but the story does pull you in and is an interesting read but the bounds of the lavish wealth is over the top.  Sex and kinky is what sells the story.  The Author steers away from being crude and raunchy in her use of language except with necessary to the story.  The message is clearly made without sounding the story comes from porn skit.  This is one thing I really commend her on.",1464307200,,739,4.170212765957447

The lost glass slipper would represent her virginity and self respect which she tries to gain back in the end after being severely punished by her 'dominant' for no reason whatsoever. Don't get me wrong- I'm all for some spicy love scenes but the storyline was so LACKING. You have no idea what his justifications are for having such a distorted view of a relationship and despite how ""intriguing"" his Edward Cullen wannabe persona is, you end up hating him and being irritated with her.

Maybe you just have to read the books... But if you're ever in the mood for kinky- you're better off sticking with Danielle Steele and erotica in streaming ((be sure you have a good antivirus beforehand- word of the wise)).",1464048000,,858,4.797297297297297

6642024,5,B00NCDVVLY,"My personal opinion of FSOG is that it is an incredibly beautiful love story. So called critics and others who are anti FSOG really do not evaluate the film on any other merits than the small part BDSM plays in the movie. Christian might attempt to objectify Anastasia in the very beginning, but he ultimately cannot and THAT IS the point of the movie!  Christian is drawn to Ana for whatever reason (he never fully understands WHY he is so attracted to Ana on a level he never has been with anyone before) and the story within the movie is how he tries be in a relationship when he never has been before.  I am enamored with the attraction that Christian has for Ana, when Ana is such a fresh, innocent, unassuming woman. He always has had to have all sorts props in order to achieve sexual release. But with Ana, he wants more. He wants a relationship with her outside of the sex or in addition to the sex. He's willing to reinvent himself, as it were, in order to be with Anastasia. Since Christian is Ana's first sexual partner, she is learning as she goes also. She's never had a serious relationship, so she isn't sure what's usual or to be expected. But she recognizes that she loves Christian Grey and wants to work on a loving relationship with him. I've watched this movie more times than I have counted and the ending gets me EVERY TIME!  Even though I know it's NOT the end!!  So, put aside what others have criticized, what they have pooh poohed, or put down and watch this incredible movie. You will be awed by the love story, and amazed at the chemistry of Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson!",1463788800,3,1604,4.408783783783784

Well, I decided to read the books because I had to know why millions of people loved these books. Well, I really liked the books. If you can stand reading a book from the point of view of a sheltered teenager, it's a pretty good read. Also, you'll enjoy the books if you don't mind the total knock off of the Twilight series minus the vampires and werewolves. I digress, after reading the books, I know why the movie was so bad now, it's because the screen writer and director didn't give the audience enough time to really know Anna and Christian. (That and wrong actors cast) You would never know by the movie how deeply taken Christian was with Anna. He was totally knocked off his game by her in the books but the movie didn't display that at all! And the most important thing of all, they totally watered down the sex scenes and left out the best ones! I've seen better sex scenes on daytime and primetime television! I don't plan on watching anymore of the movie installments because they don't plan on sticking to the books which angers me because it totally destroys the books! To sum it all up, bad screen play, bad directing, and bad acting but if you have nothing better to do, it's still an okay movie to watch but know the only similarities to the book is the name and the characters, after that it really should be called a movie based on the fifty shades of grey book not fifty shades of grey exactly like the books!",1463443200,,1512,4.3087719298245615

6642061,4,B00NCDVVLY,Love the books! Trilogy and Grey. cant wait of the fifty shades darker Christian Grey POV coming out on the 18th of June. There were a lot of scenes that they did not include in this film but since the author EL James is making the script for the Darker I'm hoping it would be better.

I found anastasias child like behavior a little strange at times and if her inner goddess appeared one more time
I would have screamed.
her interactions with Christian were unbelievable in parts of the book.
sad ending to this book but we shall see.",1463184000,,318,4.5

6642069,4,B00NCDVVLY,"The movie was great!  However, after reading the books you are a little disappointed after watching the movie.  I think they left out major key parts of the book that really describe the characters and they didn't quite capture all emotions correctly.  Basically, I felt like this movie was rushed.  Of course you are not going to be able to cram all the details of a book in one movie but I just felt they could have done better.  Maybe it will be like the Twilight series where the first movie wasn't the best but the following two are phenomenal.  I also felt like some of the characters could have been casted better, again.. just my opinion.  But the only reason I gave the movie 4 stars was because of the lack of details portrayed in the movie.",1463097600,2,751,4.398550724637682

Not sure about the books, they may be better. The film just wasn't to great. I'm sure there are better hot films on Skinamax, or just watch some porn.",1463097600,,324,4.295081967213115
6642071,1,B00NCDVVLY,"Let me start out by saying I have never written a one star review for a movie.  I generally like something about any movie.  I love movies in general.  This however, was the worst movie I've ever seen.

Now, that may seem like a bold statement.  There's been lots of bad movies over the years.  I always seem to be able to find a redeemable aspect of any movie.  There wasn't one here.  Let's go over how this movie failed at being a movie.

Acting for one, was awful.  Truly, like not even bad in an amusing way like your B Horror flicks or angst ridden teenage dramas.  I'm talking bad that pretends like it isn't bad.  Bad that walks around in a nice suit, if you will.  The lead actress tries way too hard, and the lead actor doesn't try at all.  This leads me to my next point.

Chemistry, this is particularly important in the romantic genre, which I can only assume this is trying to be.  I felt no inclination that the leads belonged together.  I felt more chemistry between her friend, and Christian's brother.  There was nothing there.  Just kinky sex, not even kinky enough to make that aspect interesting.

Writing, this is the biggest failure of this movie.  I know this is based on a novel, but out of respect for English Literature I hope it isn't true to the novel.  It's like a group of teenage girls were given a basic outline and had at it.

Cinematography, all in all mediocre, nothing to either recommend or condemn this movie.

There was a distinct lack of any plot.  No climax whatsoever(Unless you're a fan of wordplay).  The ending was so anticlimactic that I just stared at the credits.  I felt physical pain watching this movie, and I have no desire to watch it again or any sequels that may arise.",1463011200,,1725,4.393650793650794

6642076,4,B00NCDVVLY,I read the book only because I found out that the story was located in WA State (just like Twilight) and WSU since that's where my daughter's attending college so the place is familiar to me. The story is okay kind of unique it some sort of way because I don't read books that has BDSM in it this is the first time. I guess I expect more in the movie because the book is more graphic and intense than the way it was portrayed in the movie although the movie was done in good taste. Im hoping that the actors playing Christian Grey & Anastasia Steele will not be too reserved on their acting prowess for the next movie of 50 Shades Darker especially in doing the sex scenes in the film. They do have chemistry off screen when I was watching some of their interviews and behind the scene film but I hope it will be more develop for the next film of 50 Shades Darker since the two actors are already familiar & intimate from 1st movie.,1463011200,,932,4.183333333333334

Nag nag nag, and I was horrified that he might rush to go ask her to please marry him, at the very end of the movie, which thank God I didn't have to see, as it turns out.  Then she, as the wife, would have had him by his balls for the rest of his life.  This sort of thing is why the new men's movement, called men going their own way, hate the modern third wave feminism's gynocentric tyranny so much.  As a woman, I'd like to see an impervious Christian Grey, who is wuss-out-proof.  Wusses are -NOT- dominants.  Therefore, I was unable to believe for this movie.",1462838400,,748,4.232394366197183

If you enjoyed the book and know that the movie will never depict every detail that the book will have then its a good watch. I'm awaiting the second movie in the Trilogy.,1461715200,,327,4.258064516129032

After reading the series of books I know that so very much about the characters and how they came to be who they are is just not revealed. I hope there's more depth in the next movie as this book has so many levels and should be a miniseries or something.

6642185,3,B00NCDVVLY,Slick but pretty vapid and dull overall.  The end is just a teaser for the sequel.  Dakota Johnson is another matter.  It's not that she's a raving beauty nor that her body is over the top.  But her facial and vocal expressiveness are just magical and save the film.  I couldn't imagine anyone else in this role.  I will watch the sequel only if she's in it.,1461456000,,358,4.268656716417911

6642201,5,B00NCDVVLY,"While it was not as good as the book, I didn't expect it to be as none of the movies based on books are, I thoroughly enjoyed it. If you are watching based on your love of the book alone, you may be disappointed as there is quite a bit left out. However, Dakota Johnson plays a fantastic Anastasia and Jamie Dornan, while not who I would have envisioned playing the mercurial Mr. Grey, is still quite hot.

I felt the editor could have given the writer stronger writing advice. The language was very immature and often quite boring and unrealistic. However, I think Sam Taylor-Johnson did an excellent job of turning the book into an artful movie--much classier than the book.",1461024000,,432,4.773333333333333

The first time I watched it I felt a bit disappointed the actors did not exactly fit the images in my head. The second time I began to appreciate the skill and interpretation by the actors and I liked it very much. Overall I was very pleased and look forward to the next two movies.

This is the first time I've seen Dakota Fanning, I know of many actresses that I would've thought better, when I read who they thought of, it was pretty much same, just nobody wanted it.  I think Dakota was ok for the part, she took s heck of a risk & she pulled it off. Jamie Dornan on the other hand, should use that hand to whoop his own derri&egrave;re ! Christian Grey was going to be played by Charlie Hunam, he backed out last minute because of schedule conflicts. I like Charlie Hunam and he's a fellow Geordie like myself ( born in Newcastle  Upon Tyne). I think if anyone could've pulled it off it would of been Jonathan Rhys Meyers ( The Tudors)., maybe even one of the 2 actresses that played Jane Seymour, ( they used 2 different ones in The Tudors) but Dakota was still ok! Although the book has been brutally criticized I still believe the movie would've been ok, it's all in the casting, Dornan was not the man!",1460937600,3,1073,4.280788177339901

6642289,5,B00NCDVVLY,"The movie artistically presents very intimate scenes from the book, and the director, Sam Taylor-Johnson, does a beautiful job capturing the attraction and developing love between the two main characters.  Unrated version includes scenes at the end that show the aftermath of the dramatic ending. I had started to read the first book before the movie came out, but I stopped because I found the writing style lacking.  Seeing the movie inspired me to try the book again and overlook the inordinate number of irksome ""Oh My"" and ""Good point, well stated"" references in the book.  E L James had a real winner with Taylor-Johnson directing this first movie.  Hopefully the new director and screenplay adaptor will be as successful.",1459209600,,728,5.041666666666667

These two don't have any spark between them, they bring nothing to the table whatsoever. This isn't a story of a D/s at all, just a control freak with BDSM tendencies. She isn't submissive, and he gets angry when he can't make her do what he wants. That isn't a D/s at all.

Not to sound like a jerk but hey, if your going to make a film about sex and your female character is going to be nude in a lot of scenes, then hire someone with a hot body.  It will make it much more entertaining for the viewer. The film has a slow pace and uninteresting characters. i did not care for one moment about their relationship and found the guy Christian weird and unpleasant.  Anastasia is boring and not played well. She looks bored and the sex scenes look staged and are not even remotely erotic.  Stupid idea to make an R -rated film based on an X-rated novel. If your considering watching this with your partner to get you in the mood, better idea is to just rent some real porn and dont' bother with this poorly made and rushed looking stinker.  PHOOEY!!!

6642339,5,B00NCDVVLY,I liked the movie.  I felt Dakota's performance was great in conveying emotion.  Christian Grey's character acted as I would have expected.  The movie leaves you wondering if the ending is just a set up for another in the series.  The credibility of the key players stretches reality a little in that super star achievers and totally innocent beautiful girls may not actually exist.  It is also hard to distinguish between collaborative BDSM and Abuse in the brief window of this movie.  Still the interaction of the characters was interesting.  There was change in both and believe ability in the way they reacted to each other.  I will watch it again and would like to hear directors comments (not on my copy),1458086400,3,711,4.770491803278689

Anna was a little annoying but I would so buy the movie again. i really did enjoy the book though. I would recommend buying both products. and I would recommend buying this movie for a little bit of romance in your life. The movie was definitely hard core and I think I would buy the movie again. I even bought the sequel to the book and I am super excited for 50 shades darker to come out in theaters. I have a whole year to wait, but I am really excited for it to come out. i loved the movie so much that I can't wait! I watched this again last night before bed and woke up this morning and started watching it.  You should totally buy this movie and buy the book, it will make you feel hot. You will definitely need a napkin after watching the movie. Christian is an amazing actor and he is so hot. I would buy this movie 90490832 more times. . Purchase this! The story is well written and whenever I was watching the movie it put me in an amazing mood. i am always better after reading these novels and watching the movie. i would say buy it and watch it alone and read the book alone too, you will be feeling like a million bucks in no time. I am a mom and my kids drive me absolutely crazy, they yell all the time and whenever I get them down for naps I pull out my kindle and start reading this book or bring out my iPad and watch it. I forget about being a mom for a few minutes and I can actually fantasize about being the character. And then I am snapped back into reality when they wake up. i wait for them to sleep, i start counting the minutes until they are sleeping so that I can read my book and watch my movie. I even pull it out while the kids are watching tv or my husband is watching the game. i would recommend this movie to all my girlfriends it is a hot read and definitely something I would watch again ( I already have).

IMO, no matter how you slice it, this is a story about a sexual predator.  It makes me sad for all the people who gave it positive reviews under the guise of romance, or even psychological struggle.  I am not a sexual prude.  Christian is obvious damaged and that is sad, but Ana comes into the story psychologically intact.  He tries to psychologically manipulate her into something she would have not previously considered (despite any ""contract""). He uses her emotions against her.  I think any sexual activity, traditional or extreme, between a couple should be consensual, of common interest, explored and delved into together, something they will both feel good about after.. This story shows a psychologically forced activity. It kinda made me sick and I fast forwarded through the sex scenes, ( I get S&M and know what it involves, but this showed something that one partner was not comfortable with, no matter if she pretended). Yay for Ana for the ending, but I have to believe there would be psychological ramifications for this woman, whose first sexual experience was deviant. Christian, on the other hand, is heading for serial killing or raping, or maybe just psychologically damaging more women. Makes you wonder what happened to the other 15 women who slept in that room of this only 27 year old man.

6642489,4,B00NCDVVLY,"Note: My evaluation of ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" will include important points from the movie, therefore be aware of spoilers.

Select thoughts about the movie:

1. The title reveals much about the author's intent. Grey, of course, is Christian's name,. surely, intentional. According to[...] gray is described thusly:
""The color gray is an unemotional color. It is detached, neutral, impartial and indecisive - the fence-sitter"" and this one: "" The closer gray gets to black, the more dramatic and mysterious it becomes."" Note: This is the story of a man with FIFTY shades of gray!

""Shade"" (in color terminology)
'Shades are created when only black is added to a hue. This results in a rich, often more intense and darker color."" Note: Christian is very ""dark.""

From a color psychology perspective, ""gray is the color of compromise - being neither black nor white, it is the transition between two non-colors. The closer gray gets to black, the more dramatic and mysterious it becomes...Being both motionless and emotionless, gray is solid and stable, creating a sense of calm and composure, relief from a chaotic world.""

Definition of Chaos from internet dictionary
""""complete disorder and confusion.
synonyms: disorder, disarray, disorganization, confusion, mayhem, bedlam, pandemonium, havoc, turmoil, tumult, commotion, disruption, upheaval, uproar, maelstrom; Note: Even after adopted into an acceptable family, Christian's mind still lives in the chaos, the tumult of his early childhood.

Oh, yes, the names, particularly Christian, has obvious reference to Christ who was crucified to provide sinners with ready forgiveness of sins, but that is not where Christian intends to go. Instead of forgiveness, Christian subconsciously dwells on punishment, thus his ""play room."" Too much chaos, too much gray. ""Anastacia"" means resurrection. More on her name later.

The reader/viewer can readily see that the author was deliberate with his word choice and name choices. Of course, the obvious plot line follows a course of erotica, and, as one reviewer called it, the ""life style."" But neither is the true subject of this movie: instead, it is the study of a personality gone way off course because of severe child abuse. At Ana's graduation, Christian, a major donor to the university and guest speake,, tells his audience that he knew what ""extreme hunger"" was. W-h-a-t?, my little brain asked? First clue to Christian's deeply secretive life--severe child abuse. At another juncture Ana wants to know what had happened to him as a boy. He replied, ""You could not look at me the same way again if you knew.""Deep stuff

After reading several reviews, I was dismayed and stunned to discover that so many people thought the movie erotic and romantic even though Christian directly told Ana that he did not do romance. Instead of writing a review of the obvious surface plot line, I decided to write what I think is the point of this movie. Because of severe childhood trauma, some severely damaged children develop a hidden identity (or multiple personalities).  Instead, in adulthood, Christian turned to an inner life which found an outlet hidden in his play room under lock and key. After the numbing experience of his childhood, he needed to be in total control, thus he became the Dominator.

 Ana's reluctance to sign the contract shows her tenuous thoughts about signing it, yet she does not reject it out of hand because of its horrors. For whatever reason, he begins to fall in love (whatever that is) with Anastacia. She submerges partially into his life style, the one that protects him from more pain. Like any woman in that circumstance, she thinks she can change him. Sure enough, he does seem willing to address his boundaries and even lowers some. Yet, the terribly sad outcome of the story is Ana's resurrection. She cannot stay.

The director does not present his thesis as an in-your-face subject, nor does he offer any solutions. What he does is open the door to dialogue about child abuse, probably the most common cause of societal ills. What can be done, he seems to ask. Will the viewer respond in any way?",1455926400,,4133,5.061764705882353

6642496,3,B00NCDVVLY,"I read the books so I knew what I was getting into. No complaints on what the story is (and it's not a story of abusing women, if anyone still believes that). But it seemed like the filmmakers knew their audience would have read the books too, so they scrapped the character and relationship development for the sake of hitting the plot points and getting to the hot stuff. It was like watching a 2 hour preview to a much better movie. Every scene felt forced, like we just tuned in to the interesting part and missed all the setup. And I swear some parts were literally sped up, like when a movie is shown on cable TV and needs to fit the time slot. The only time I felt the appropriate intensity of the story and between the characters (and therefore, felt interested in what I was watching) was in the last 10-15 minutes. Finally, some conflict and character arcs! Even in a trilogy each part must be able to stand on its own.
What I really find unfortunate is that though none of the books are particularly good, per se, the first book is the most honest and heartfelt and deserved better treatment than this.",1455753600,2,1113,4.381642512077295

The first 15 minutes I didn't think I was going to finish the film, it took awhile to get used to the awful dialogue and I felt bad for the actors having to say some of the stuff. I thought while reading the books the dialogue was terrible but credit to the screenwriters that they wanted to keep it in line with the books.  The acting got better as the movie went along and I thought they did a great job with what they had.  As with the books, the cliffhanger is BS and makes me want to punch someone in the face it's such a cheap trick and makes me angry at myself for getting fooled twice with it (how do you think I ended up reading the second book?!).

The ""text message"" caption bubbles were completely unreadable.  The text was so tiny that I would've had to get up off my couch just to read it.  Completely spoiled the entire movie, and it's baffling that somebody at the film studio wouldn't have noticed this when pressing up these DVD's for release.  Oh that's right, they were all watching it on either a computer monitor with their faces 6"" from the screen, or on a giant big-screen movie theatre where each letter was 3 feet tall.  Did they really have no clue that people might actually be watching this DVD in their homes on a regular television screen?  Mine is not small btw, 29"" or more I think?  And yes my eyesight is perfect with contacts in, I never have the slightest problem reading other words in movies, TV shows, etc.  Somebody really really dropped the ball here, and it ruined an otherwise perfectly entertaining movie.

Then this 2015 film adaptation premiered on February 13, 2015 of last year. Who says they don't strategically plan the release dates as nothing quite says ""Happy Valentines Day"" quite like a dozen roses, a box of chocolates, and a romantic evening playing tie-me-up & spank me?

Ill end on this thought; most moviegoers seem to agree that sequels are not usually as good as the first. But the bRiDe and I went to see 50 Shades of Black this past weekend, and oh my, the aggressively romantic mood it inspired in momma. Whap! - Ouch! - Sigh!!",1455062400,,747,4.485294117647059

6642593,5,B00NCDVVLY,I have to say that the first time I watched the movie I was a little disappointed. Not really with the quality of performances but I think I was hung up on comparing it to the books. I have since watched it a few times and have to say I like it better every time. I have read many reviews that bash the actors and I think that is unfair. In my opinion both Dornan and Johnson were an excellent choice. I hope they stay with the production of series. I was skeptical at first because I guess we all have actors we consider sexy and vulnerable and had them in mind for the parts. Honestly I believe that if they had picked known actors we may have been disappointed. The fact that we we unfamiliar with these actors made watching an experience rather than just the book on screen and predicable. I challenge those who had negative comments to watch it again and this time forget the book and feel the story. Watching inexperienced Anna calm the demons inside Christian is moving. This film is not about sex (though there is that) it is about a tortured soul find home.,1454457600,,1066,4.308457711442786

6642664,3,B00NCDVVLY,"My wife wanted to watch this, and I was admittedly curious, given all the hype. She liked it, said it was a good movie, perhaps to watch again someday.

I'm undecided if I would ever watch it again. It is an interesting exploration of human sexuality and power dynamics of relationships. The sex scenes seemed realistic, not particularly titillating and were never disturbing. Anybody shocked by any of this needs to get out of the cave they live in.

I am glad this move got out there, and anyone hyping it did really need to have this to loosen some of their prudish bonds (pun?maybe?). It may have done some good to de-stigmatize SM/bondage/domination. I do honor the mixed reactions from people within the lifestyle, and recognize that I don't completely understand those who find such relationships fulfilling. It does help me not be so judgmental - to see that in many cases we are more slaves/victims of our own internal emotional workings than of some other person. It does, however, show some fuzziness of issues of consent. Nothing here falls into a clear definition of rape, but it does show how it may not always be easy (or desired?) to stay on the ""safe"" side. The writers/producers went to great lengths to be ethical and make the ""best practices"" very clear, but the whole illusion of ""control"" is explored. That alone, makes the movie worthy of watching, but I still don't see the motivation for the hype - other than that  the door of the porn closet is now a bit further open. I'm okay with that closet door being open, I just hope we don't spend too much time or energy in there, and that we don't neglect the sanctity of relationships because of it.

Watch it, but do so consciously and don't get too caught up in it.",1453852800,,1738,4.578778135048232

It's very troubling that so many women are wetting their panty liners reading this book. I guess men have found that so many women get turned off on the porn that they make, that they have concocted these pie in the sky love stories to try and tell them the only way to sexual satisfaction is to become a subservient and obedient wife.

However the writing is excruciating to those who have fallen in love with the books. Mr. Grey showed no emotion or change in the entire film. He was cold and never changing, and yet in the first book you see him wanting ""more"". You see that Anastasia means more to him. I will say again.

But, let me first say, I did not read the novel before watching the film, and I'm really glad that I didn't. I absolutely loved this movie and was enthralled throughout the entire length, beginning to end. The emotion, deep-seeded and ""obvious"" dark romance pulled me in and I have to say that this has become one of my favorite ""romance"" films, as strange as that may sound. Perhaps it's because I understand the BDSM lifestyle, and enjoy similar situations, but either way, the connection between Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele is absolutely wrenching. I highly recommend at least giving this film a chance, as you may be surprised at your reaction. I cannot WAIT for '50 Shades Darker.'",1453075200,,795,4.896296296296296

6642737,1,B00NCDVVLY,"So yes I read the books- the first one in a week and downloaded the 2nd one immediately. I enjoyed the story even without the writing. Time has allowed me to be sullied on the books since book 3 is just more repetitive stories from book one and two- and don't even get me started on the 4th book- nope I will not read it. I will not give EL James one more red cent of my money for the drivel she writes. So I waited to watch this on HBO.

And while the book was repetitive sniveling drivel from Ana- at least she had a life outside of Christian. She had a job and goals- this aspect of her life was completely removed from the movie- now it looks like her entire world is to please Grey- that does not make her powerful. That makes her weak. Sure she walked away in the end, but since there are sequels you know that they end up back together.

As far as chemistry? These two don't have it. Dakota johnson's voice seems nasally and lack of any fluctuation. Jamie for an, who I am a fan of, I wonder if he was directed to not do an American accent???? Most people from other countries can remove their accents. They had zero chemistry.

Truth be told it was much worse than I anticipated. I am disappointed that this movie made as much as it did. I am disappointed that Dornan said he wouldn't do the sequels and has now been signed on for them. Although I will watch when they are on HBO again because el James husband is now doing the screen writing- giving this woman more control on it will make it that much more of a train wreck!!!",1452988800,,1536,4.130434782608695

I've seen a lot of movies and this has to be on my top 3 worst I have ever witnessed. The light hearted little quips they drop as humor relief is enough to make me want to cut myself. If I was made to watch it again, I would rip my eyes out. Basically a high budget cinemax movie. I hate to say I  failed to find some appreciation for every movie I've ever seen, but this movie is just one long 50 year old wet dream for those who married young and never hit their sexual stride.

It didn't bring in all elements of the book, and some things happen differently in the movie than portrayed in the book, but this should be expected. The books are nearly 600 pages each. Obviously all the material won't make it in the film. Still, I was impressed with the quality of the film. I thought Jamie Dornan (who plays Christian Grey) did a fantastic job portraying a damaged character. Obviously, there are several seriously sexual scenes, so you may want to watch this movie before deciding if you'd be comfortable watching it with someone else. Dakota Johnson (who plays Anastasia Steele) is in really vulnerable, erotic positions for the entire end half of the film. There is a lot of nudity in this film, too.

If you are an adult and you liked the Twilight series, you will probably enjoy this movie as well because they are very similar... Hmmm... maybe because the story started out as fan fiction! The story is switched up a little...e.g. no vampires... and the names are changed, obviously, but otherwise... it's much the same with more of the eroticism that was lacking in the young adult Twilight novels.  I liken this to a cross between Twilight and Harlequin.  The SM aspect of it is pretty tame, though I probably wouldn't want my teenager daughter watching something like this.  The nudity and sexual ""situations"" in the film are pretty graphic for an R-rated movie, but probably not much worse than 9 1/2 weeks or Last Tango in Paris (if any of you remember those films).  As far as the DVD goes, I've had problems with several of these discs not playing and giving me an error stating that they can't be used with my DVD player.

First of all the actors were all wrong for the roles and secondly there was so much missing dialogue that that the essence of the story is lost. Then there is the music.  While most of it is okay Beyonce just ruined it for me.  During one of the major sex scenes in the book Christian played very specific music for Anastasia, we should have had the pleasure of listening to the same music during that scene, but instead we got Beyonce.  In my opinion there is not much that is less sexy than Beyonce.  I would have rather they played just about anything else.

6642806,5,B00NCDVVLY,"""Camp...is not a natural mode of sensibility, if there be any such. Indeed the essence of Camp is its love of the unnatural: of artifice and exaggeration.

1. To start very generally: Camp is a certain mode of aestheticism. It is one way of seeing the world as an aesthetic phenomenon. That way, the way of Camp, is not in terms of beauty, but in terms of the degree of artifice, of stylization.

2. To emphasize style is to slight content, or to introduce an attitude which is neutral with respect to content. It goes without saying that the Camp sensibility is disengaged, depoliticized -- or at least apolitical.
...
18. One must distinguish between naive and deliberate Camp. Pure Camp is always naive. Camp which knows itself to be Camp (""camping"") is usually less satisfying.

19. The pure examples of Camp are unintentional; they are dead serious.
...
23. In naive, or pure, Camp, the essential element is seriousness, a seriousness that fails. Of course, not all seriousness that fails can be redeemed as Camp. Only that which has the proper mixture of the exaggerated, the fantastic, the passionate, and the naive.
...
58. The ultimate Camp statement: it's good because it's awful . . . Of course, one can't always say that. Only under certain conditions, those which I've tried to sketch in these notes.""

I also understand that the movie could not possibly capture all that was in the book; however, the movie does present a good and sufficient story line. Some folks thought the movie was a little slow, but it needed to be somewhat slow so that writer could establish a story line. That way, the film would not be just about sex (wham bam thank you ma'am), but it would actually have some substance. This movie did have substance. I also thought that choosing Dakota Johnson to play to role of Anastasia was a great move. Dakota's inexperience in the film industry was parallel to Anastasia's inexperience in life which made Dakota a perfect fit for that role. Dakota's acting was superb. You are certainly able to connect with Anastasia's emotions. Although there is full nudity and sexually explicit scenes, it in no way did this movie meet the level of porn. The camera guys were on point. However, I am glad that I watched it at home. I am not too sure if I would have felt comfortable sitting beside a stranger watching this movie in a theater.

6642822,1,B00NCDVVLY,"You have to take this movie & book with a grain of salt.....it's meant to make money, not be true.  This is NOT a true BDSM relationship.  A real BDSM relationship is founded on respect, limits, and communication.  It's not for the dominate/master/madame to have a toy to take out all their frustrations or issues on; nor is the goal to harm the sub/slave.  I've been Madame for years and I've never once started a dom/sub relationship by handing my sub a contract stating only what I want.  That's abuse, not BDSM.  My role as a Madame is to help my submissive learn about themselves.  To push their boundries, try new things, and work through issues holding them back.  I only do what they want.  In a BDSM relationship, the submissive honestly holds all the power.  Before we ever think about doing a scene/session together we sit down and discuss what the submissive wants out of this relationship.  We hammer out each others soft & hard limits.  After a period of time, we go back over the purpose and all of our limits; as they change over time.  So, don't look at this book or movie as how all BDSM relationships or lifestyles are because it's not.  This book & movie were more about a man who had issues he'd never dealt with and abused women to cope with his emotional issues.  Plain and simple this book was about women willing to subject themselves to abuse by a man who cared nothing for them or their wellbeing.  A healhty BDSM relationship can be a beautiful process of loving, learning, and growing.  If you've never tried it or truly researched what BDSM is, then you don't have the information to comment or condemn.",1451347200,6,1633,4.537671232876712

I saw NOTHING passionate or daring in this film. I can name tons of movies that were more erotic than this. It wasn't even erotic at all. The stuff Christian did in the film was so tame that you can see more heat on a LMN movie. I kept checking to make sure I watched the right movie. This couldn't be THE 50 Shades of Grey everyone goes over. I figure the books have to be ten times more erotic than this because this movie was PG at best.

There was no steam and NO chemistry between the characters. This was like a watered down version of a wannabe porno flick. No imagination, nothing stimulating about the sex scenes whatsoever. The sex scenes were boring, immature and laughable and the movie cut the scenes off at the best part. I don't get it. I thought this movie would steam up the screen but it wasn't even half as hot as films like Fatal Attraction, 9 1/2 Weeks, Basic Instinct and MANY others.

Did I watch the right movie? I have to assume the books are much steamier because I've seen PG-13 movies with more passion and hotter sex in them than this.

If you want to see real passion and erotica then check out some of the films I named up above. This 50 Shades adaptation has nothing on any of them!

The budget was low, the acting was terrible, and the movie screen dripped with cheese. After Christian introduced Anastasia to the Red Room, however, things took an unexpected turn. I was prepared for the BDSM aspect of the story. What I was NOT prepared for was the blatant emotional abuse. The story was much more about  a girl trapped in an abusive relationship with a psychopath than a couple mutually enjoying kinky sex. I left the theater feeling depressed because so many girls and women find this kind of story romantic. There was far more control, manipulation, coercion, and mental/emotional abuse than sex. Also, the production value of this movie was also atrocious.

I totally believed him in this role and found him to be mesmerizing. The looks, the aloofness, the control....dynamite! The story was okay, I guess, I have never read the book or books. so I had a fresh perspective. He had me melting. Now the down side of this movie. Where Jamie gets a 5 star rating from me, Dakota Johnson is a 1. She was so dull, I would rather watch paint dry. Again, I haven't read the book so I am going by the movie. he laid out his life and his quirks for her, showed her his playroom etc and told her he is not the romantic guy and not into dating and all of his ""things"". He gave her a contract, too which she read and made addendums to! She wouldn't sign she just wanted to change him. she was stupidly annoying. For God's sake, send him my way!

I could not stop laughing the whole way through this movie. First, the very hokey takes on the Twilight series, but more the absolutely funny moments throughout the movie. Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan are great in this movie. If I may be allowed, since this movie is based on a fan-fic of Twilight, Ana is so much better acted than Bella (though having read the opening via Kindle free preview, I can honestly say Twilight is better written) and Dakota is an much better actress than Kristen Stewart. Jamie is on par with Robert Pattinson, though I think Edward is a better character over all. The way they treat the subject matter of BDSM is absolutely the best comedic moments in cinematic history.

6642857,3,B00NCDVVLY,"The movie wasn't a complete disaster, but it did leave A LOT to be desired.
First of all.. Dakota and Jamie have no on screen chemistry, I almost choked on their awkwardness. It seemed to be crawling out of the screen.
Second.. I have read all the books, and I get it. They are long and filled with filler detail. I understand you can't fit all of that into the movie. Here in lies the problem though... The movie was a repetitive cycle of Christian setting his boundaries, Anna trying to dispute them, sex, and then Anna emotional roller coaster because christian kept his word and stuck to his boundaries, so like a child, she throws a fit. And this cycle is just repeated endlessly with a few minor tweaks here and there. I'm pretty sure most viewers get the point. Quit with the whining contest and put more adequate content in the movie. I'm here to watch a sexy romance, not an episode of law and order.
Third... The characters have absolutely no distinguishable positive personality traits. You have Christian with his God complex, egocentric, aloofness. Then you have Anna with her timid, virginal, whimpering adolescent behaviour. Sometimes she tried to be a sexy adulteress, but it looked more like how a kid dresses up in their parents clothes to make themselves look older. I'm positive my 12 year old dog has more sexual prowess.
4th. I know I touched on this, but seriously. There was no plot. The only thing the movie really got into was this absurd viewing of what they think BDSM is (sorry to burst your bubble, but handcuff and getting spanked with a belt is kinky.. Not BDSM.) and the sex contract. Oh, and Christian's money, making it look like Anna was a gold digger. I think the only reason the producers dodged that bullet is for the reason I stated earlier. My old dog has more sexual prowess. I'm sure a sloth does too.
This is honestly a movie for 17 year old girls to go see with their boyfriends so they can get their hormones pumping. If you are a rational, logical adult, this movie will make you want to slam your head on a blunt axe.",1450483200,2,2065,4.509333333333333

Well, it doesn't take the brain power of Professor Brian Cox (now there's a real man, good looking and staggeringly intelligent) to realise that 'something awful' happened to Mr Grey for him to be such a controlling, manipulative, stalking jerk. I watched the film with a friend, against my better judgement. Oh dear...oh dear. I thought that Hollywood had plummeted to the depths with 'Titanic' and the supremely awful 'Avatar' but this is far, far worse. Bad acting, no chemistry and a risible storyline that could have been covered in 10 minutes. The female lead (a moderately pretty girl) alternated between biting her lip (rather a lot), trying (unconvincingly) to be provocative and behaving like a cringing Victorian ingnue, whilst Jamie Dornan just looked plain wooden and unbelievable. In fact I don't think he varied the expression on his face during the entire movie. The only good thing about this movie were two songs - Earned It and Love Me Like You Do.

I had to know how it ended. I'm not sure why it had such an effect on me, but I was drawn in to the romance and the evolution of the characters. I do agree with others that the movie is a little disjointed. After reading the book there were several scenes that just made a lot more sense to me. That, however, is my only complaint. I remember people I know saying how ""dirty"" the book/movie was. I actually didn't think it was that bad. The love scenes were not overly done and you really get a sense just how much Christian and Ana want each other and especially how much Christian is thrown by the feelings he has for Ana and how he wants to protect not hurt her.

6642953,4,B00NCDVVLY,"I had absolutely no interest in this book or this film. I saw it by accident, and was actually surprised that I enjoyed it. It does share certain similarities to Twilight in that an extraordinary man is obsessively attracted to an awkward and very ordinary girl and that he can't be with said girl, but is too obsessed to stay away from her either. It is the sort of fantasy that appeals to every woman except for the B&M parts.

Since reviews I read said that book was far better than the movie, I gave that a shot and was so disappointed. The character of Ana was so childish and the writing so silly and immature, that I couldn't stand reading it anymore. In the movie version, the character of Ana had a certain appeal to her that made the relationship actually seem believable-- as she was portrayed as being mature, classy, and smart. While the literary Ana was like reading the inner thoughts of a teenage girl.  I am definitely interested in seeing the sequels to the film and will stay far away from reading the books to learn this information.",1448755200,,1053,4.479166666666667
6642954,1,B00NCDVVLY,"Ah, this is a pretty terrible movie and even if you're into BDSM, it's not sexy at all.  During the scenes that are supposed to be without boundaries and dark, I felt as though I could read the actor's minds.  Jamie Dornan's thoughts were more complex, which is acceptable, given that he's a little older.  First on his mind was why did he allow himself to be so manipulated by his agent:  first, he's a really creepy serial killer and now he's a low-energy dominant?  Dakota Johnson's were right there for anyone to see:  is my career over before it's even started?

I've worked for men who are scarier and more of an ape than Christian Grey without taking their clothes off or brandishing a whip.  If you want to be titillated or even remotely turned on, don't watch this movie.  You have better things to do.  You know you do.  Do them now.  Do. Them. Now.  Do not disappoint me.

6642960,1,B00NCDVVLY,"Emily Blunt over at BluntReview (dot) com says: Yech. Sadly, the whole thing is a tad (read:huge) disappointment. The first hour-ish is us being tortured by a young lady being volleyed between two non-schooled frames of acting; super dull, and just uninteresting - flat. We are to believe this prosaic young woman brings on the advances of a mysterious billionaire bachelor. He is immediately intrigued (by what??) and pursues her like a badly written romance novel...complete with a helicopter ride to a date. The whole set up is so unfathomable, you start yelling at the screen, ""You're kidding right? Has the writer ever had a passionate embarkation?"" Then Mr. Grey eludes (annoyingly coyly over and over) to his particular sex style - that involves a disclosure agreement pages long. Um, it's kinky sex <- well, we keep being told. He's rich, handsome, has a squad of ""helpers"", he can get a submissive gal-toy in half an hour...sheesh. Ah, then as she gives in to his magical allure, the movie gets all porn-y, and pouty and even more silly. A film called 9 1/2 Weeks did this decades ago...but, made it actually erotic and sexy. Perhaps if the lead woman wasn't played as monochromatic as a generic fast-food chain's paper napkin, you could - possibly - buy the rest. But from frame one, the waiting for the huge hoopla wanes; this is pure unadulterated mock-sexy. Though, if you wanna watch strangers do it? Yep, that's in here...Wanna see Jamie Dornan show you he really does know how to act - honestly? Watch The Fall on Netflix; so so much better.

The lead characters were so bad it was liking watching 2 robots pretending to be human. The dialogue is the best part of the movie and that is only because coming from those robotic mouths it was extremely funny. I should have known better as I tried to read the first book but it was so bad that I could only get through the first chapter. Since the movie is free on cable, I thought I would give it a try but it is every bit as bad as the book. The actors playing the main characters should hang their heads in shame at the performance they gave, it was truly horrendous from start to finish. I think the actress playing Anastasia was high during the whole movie as she appeared half dead in every scene, the Christian character seemed as if he was trying hard not to be noticed as if he could just get through the movie without anyone noticing he was there. The actor must have realized how awful the movie was and wanted to pretend he was not really in it.

It focuses more on Christian and Ana, while the other characters don't get much attention or are not mentioned at all (I'm talking about Christian's house keeper...not that it really matters.) I thought the ending was great, but some people complained about it....I don't get why. There Are Three Books!! Any way, the final scene in the unrated version was kinda of satisfying.

The sadistic elements in the book are the principle items, but while the film also makes it the main element of the plot, the film does not overplay it as the book does.",1448496000,,459,4.348837209302325

6642972,1,B00NCDVVLY,I don't understand all the fifty shades hype. I personally have read better BDSM romance books and seen way better movies than this. The characters are boring and the acting is terrible. Christian acts like a serial killer and reminds me of Ted Bundy and Anastasia give me a break. The whole movie she looks terrified and/or shows no emotion at all. Talk about miss casting. They just don't look good together. Anastasia is way to skinny quite frankly so is he.  There is really no heat between these two. There relationship is so tiresome. The movie is so cloudy and dark. I felt like I needed a flashlight. This is just another franchise out to make money off of a niche market of women willing to pay for this crap. I am glad I saw this movie and read the book for free.,1448496000,,773,4.368055555555555

Christian holds the world to his personal standards, that fundamental part of his character wasn't there either.  The director did a terrible job portraying any chemistry between Christian and Ana, the scenes between lust, and learning to understand one another were without flow, it was hard to follow.

It usually shows its fangs when you're deap in a relationship & both people are feeling safe. Then the truth flows. This movie needs to be seen by everyone because so many relationships don't sit down & discuss what each party wants out of that.. Not talking wealth here, this has nothing to do with that..  A verbal contract when you are within any relationship should be the norm but it's so far off now..if you are with someone be happy & if you are not happy get out if you can.. Christian is in his own "" prison"" & Ana is trying to get someone to just sleep next to her which is not in Christians game plan because of his childhood for one..

There is nothing erotic and sensuous about these two together.  And why is this girl using a flip phone?  And he is a billionaire who plays a piano by Fazoli?  I can only think that the budget was so blown for this tripe that a Steinway could not be afforded.  It is just as bad as the book .,1448064000,,468,4.287356321839081
6642994,3,B00NCDVVLY,"No use writing a long review since it will be gone (land a few pages over) in a few days and nobody will skim that far to read it considering the high amount of reviews here already.  I didn't really know what Fifty Shades of Grey was about.  Well I had a good idea... it was either about extreme sex or romance.  I did my best to ignore the heavy amount of advertising earlier this year.  Turns out it's a little of both.  My dad's girlfriend joked that I shouldn't watch this movie and that it's inappropriate for me (a 34 year old man).  I thought she was hinting that the romance is really strong but well, it's actually because of the sexual stuff, haha.

It's about a mentally disturbed man played by Jamie Dornan who doesn't care about normal relationships.  He doesn't like cuddling, taking girls out to dinner or going to the movies.  Nah, instead... he likes to dominant women sexually using all kinds of chains, whips, traps, straps, etc.  Really crazy stuff.  You know, typical dominance nonsense that hopefully only a small population of people legitimately enjoy.  The problem is that the woman he likes (played by Dakota Johnson) doesn't give a rats behind about any of that stuff. She just wants a normal relationship with a guy she finds irresistible.  So what happens when the relationship gets serious?

Well that's an interesting word isn't it?  Serious.  As in, don't take this movie seriously because there's nothing serious about it.  It's either unintentionally hilarious or intentionally hilarious.  For the first 30 minutes Fifty Shades of Grey leads us into believing it's going to be a typical plodding clichd romantic story until that MAJOR turn of events occurs and Jamie shows Dakota his room of sexual pleasure.  That in itself is quite funny, but to really drive home the funniness it turns out that in order to be Jamie's girlfriend, Dakota has to sign a contract and abide by his dominance rules.  She has to submit to his sexual fantasies whenever he calls for is.  The rules are strict, and rather hilariously shortly after we even hear those rules spoken out loud through narration like he's reading the ten commandments.

What's in it for Dakota?  She gets to have whatever she wants since Jamie's a spoiled man with tons of money, a variety of cars and a really fancy looking luxurious apartment room.  He buys her laptops, a nice car, etc.  All because she's following along to this contract Jamie created that she has to become a submissive sex slave basically.  Well isn't that touching... not!  Dakota actually goes along with this which is the best part.  What a really bizarre movie, and the sexual stuff is pretty strong with lots of nudity too so be warned of this.  We see Dakota naked and participating in all kinds of sexual dominating acts just to please the mentally confused Jamie Durnan.  I'd be using that whip alright... for a completely different reason!

At the very least, give us a satisfying ending and an explanation WHY Jamie acts the way he does towards women other than that's his prerogative.  I mean come on!  His character is so shallow, but I guess some would argue it's mysterious and fitting that way.  3 stars is about right for this one.  Shallow and silly writing that comes off as overblown nonsense.  However the story is at least somewhat original and more appropriate than say, a late night Cinemax show if you get what I mean.  This one at least tries to tell a story.  And how creepy is it that Dakota's mom resembles her roommate.  Yes creepy indeed.",1448064000,,3532,4.68130081300813

I think they did a great job of casting and an even better job of set designing that picks up on more than the book describes, but I thought the small dialog revisions they made were brilliant (""Everything for the perfect serial killer"" at the completion of Grey's hardware store visit).

6643085,2,B00NCDVVLY,"This seemed to be a very long preview of the book. Instead of taking a portion of the book and having a continuous storyline, they chopped up the book and only gave us brief glimpses of each portion of the book.

Most of the book is the thoughts in Ana's head. They could have thrown a couple of those in there to make more sense of the situations going on on the screen.

I have read the book so I knew what was going on, but if I hadn't, this would have been a terrible movie. Just a little better than a softcore porno.",1446854400,,522,4.009615384615385

In fact, I thought maybe I had the wrong copy until I viewed the regular version and they were still pretty much the same. If I buy something that is ""unrated"", I expect it to be different than the R rated version I paid to see in the theater. I still liked the movie and was happy to see it after reading the books. I would have rated it three stars but that says ""It's okay"" well, it was better than okay just disappointing.",1446768000,,532,4.174757281553398

6643124,1,B00NCDVVLY,"To be as plain as possible, this movie sucks. I read all of the books (which were mediocre) so I felt like I had to see the movie for closure. The actors playing the lead roles have the worst chemistry. The story was forced into too small a time frame. If you had to cancel you Cinemax subscription and need some of that classic late night bad softcore porn action, get this movie. If you're looking for the most basic and boring ways to spice up your bedroom life, get this movie. You'll probably be disappointed.",1446422400,,514,4.364583333333333

6643151,5,B00NCDVVLY,"Many people think this is a story about sex, lust, and pain, but that is just a small, albeit important, part of the story.  The real underlying  storyline is one of 'Love at First Sight' on the part of both an innocent and inexperienced Anastasia Steel, and a tortured, needy, powerful Christian Grey, but it takes both of them some time to realise just how deep and true their love really is.  This is a story of trust, courage, understanding and reliance, each on the other until to realisation that the sex, and all it's variations, become incidental to the deep and powerful feelings they have or each other. I am now anxiously awaiting the two sequels: Fifty Shades of Darker, and Freed.  A more powerful love story has not been written before, and it s a pity, though necessary, that so much of the story in the book, has been left out. A 'MUST VIEW' for all the broadminded romantics like me",1446076800,,899,4.4969325153374236

6643164,5,B00NCDVVLY,"Given the phenomenal success of the book the film version comes with a built in fan base  a very passionate fan base  which means box office success is pretty much a sure thing.  Record-breaking numbers in pre-sale tickets is also a solid indicator you're going to have a gigantic hit.  Personally, I loved this movie despite my disappointment over some of the scenes from the book not making it into the film, scenes which I think would have better served the film adaptation. Under director Sam Taylor-Johnson's artistic eye the movie looks beautiful but feels too fast.  As much as I enjoyed it, the movie felt a little rushed.
If you are one of those people who are going to watch this movie just for the sex then you are missing the big picture. Yes, it's a sexy movie but at its core it's a love story.  The sex, which is only 20 minutes of the entire movie, is hot and erotic and done with the utmost taste and class. Dakota Johnson (Anastasia Steele) and Jamie Dornan (Christian Grey) are perfectly cast and, I don't care what anyone says, their chemistry is pitch perfect.  This is Dakota Johnson's movie since the story is seen from her character's point-of-view and it's a star-making performance. She nails every single emotion and nuance perfectly, which is not surprising if you are familiar with the talented actress's previous work.  Jamie Dornan is a perfect Christian Grey.  Aside from his obvious physical attritbutes  the Northern Irish actor is both unbelievably gorgeous and sexy  he personifies Christian's Grey's dominance and alloofness with a subtle and enigmatic performance.  I just can't see this movie working as well with other actors in the lead roles.  Johnson and Dornan bring sensuality, sweetness and humour to Ana and Christian. On a side note: I thought Dornan's American accent was impeccable. I never once heard a trace his Irish accent so I don't know what some people are talking about.
Taylor-Johnson has managed to bring one of the most provocative books to life by staying true to its origins, not an easy task considering the erotic-BDSM subject matter.  An erotic love story such as this has not been seen in mainstream cinema in a very long time, the operative word here being 'mainstream.'  The studio producing Fifty Shades of Grey wanted to appeal to a wide audience so it opted for an R rating as opposed to the controversial NC-17 rating, which probably would have served the movie better.  However, it still pushes the R-rating boundaries of mainstream cinema but it's more of a tease.  And like Ana, you will want more. Lucky for us fans Fifty Shades of Grey is a trilogy and two more films  Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed  have already been confirmed.",1445904000,,2719,4.7837259100642395

6643186,1,B00NCDVVLY,"Where to start? Firstly, if you have not read the books, you will have NO IDEA what's going on the whole movie. I read the books, and I was having a hard time keeping up. They took everything majorly important in the books and only gave the audience half. All of the small details that made up the understanding of the whole relationship vanished and all you get is a skeleton plot with no real rising action, climax, nor dalling action. Secondly, the actors did the best they could with the script they were given and I'll give them the most credit for effort and shame the director under a rock for negligence. Lastly, the light cast on BDSM is disgusting. It is portrayed terribly and should be very much revised in the next film. The book series is excellent.

Seems like the idea that this guy is rich is supposed to make this very beautiful talented woman with so much to offer feel Lucky to have attracted his attention and that is absurd.
It is unbelievable that she would suffer over a decision about being with this damaged guy who is offering to share nothing of himself.

So I can't wait for the next one to come out. I found it to be a romantic chic flick, but that's what I was looking for on a rainy cold night, watching a movie on my Kindle.

There's a lot better representations of actual s and m online, I'd look there instead of here if you're curious.
Overall not a fan of the acting, dialogue, or plot. Was predictable and not sexy at all if you're familiar with bondage and s&m. Rather boring.",1445558400,2,564,4.824742268041237

This waste of film had all the kinkiness and sexiness that Dudley Moore pulled off in ""Foul Play"" when he showed Goldie Hawn his sex toys. Only when they did it, it was truly funny. ""Fifty Shades"" didn't even have characters that had a spark on screen. You didn't care for them at the beginning of the film, and you felt no different at the end of the film.

It's about the strength of a woman and her Life Lessons. It has humor and sadness mixed with sexiness. What more does one want?,1444780800,6,448,4.6835443037974684

There is very little story, and because so much of the book occured in Anna's head it was hard to portray her and Christian's mental battles.

6643371,2,B00NCDVVLY,"I read the books and loved them! However I'm not one to criticize how it is written as long as it catches my attention(only too many misspelled words can cause me to put down a book with a good story line). Then we have the movie that is never as good as the book and I totally understand it's hard to stick a really good novel in 2 hour time frame & expect for it to come out as detailed or as well done. Same thing goes for this movie. I really had to give a lot of thought to my rating because I basically thought the movie was o.k. What killed it for me was the acting/actors. JD is in no shape, form or fashion a Christian Grey. Christian Grey is a dark, brooding, sexy beyond belief alpha ""dominating"" male who makes women melt with a glance. Would I pick Dakota Johnson as Anastasia? No .She definitely looks too old to be a college student  .. but I could live with her being in that role if there were enough chemistry going on between her and JD. How can you tell a story involving a highly sexual BDSM relationship when the character acts like he don't even like her. If JD passed Johnson on the street or a female like her, he wouldn't give her a second glance and it shows badly in this movie!  An actor such as Ian Somerhalder would have been perfect for the role of christian imo. You need a bad boy to play an experienced BDSM dominant I Not a boy scout. I have to give Johnson credit I think she gave it her best shot but when the other character doesn't cooperate then it doesn't do well...and I'm not knocking either one of their looks...They both are very good looking and in the proper roles could maybe do good. But for me the leads being too out of character and lack of chemistry killed it for me. I even watched it at the cinema on the release date and again at home when it came out on video to give it a fair chance. So bottom line is this film lacks the chemistry, angst and emotionally scarred dom u would expect to see and that throws the whole film off course.",1444176000,,1991,4.128865979381444

Dakoka Johnson really brought Anastasia to life on the big screen. Jamie Dornan an admirable  job as Christian, I just think that no matter whom the producers chose as ""fifty"" nobody would be the perfect fit as nothing is better than who you conjure in your mind. With that said, Dornan did a good job with the material he was given.

They skipped over so much and I think the biggest thing they excluded was Christians overbearing way he took care of Anastasia. I think part of the draw to the 50 Shades series was  Christian's protectiveness over Ana. I know it seems barbaric and chauvinistic at times but we as women live busy lives with so much responsibility. This books is fantasy and the fantasy of a man taking care of everything so we don't have to worry about anything is a great escape. I think they missed the mark excluding that part of him.
I LOVE the reality of my life and wouldn't change a thing, but also enjoyed the fantasy of 50 Shades...the books that is.",1443916800,,722,4.348148148148148

6643407,1,B00NCDVVLY,"Don't waste your time. This movie was horrible and disappointing. I read the book series and quite enjoyed them. The movie doesn't build up the characters and show how these two have this intense connection.  I also had to just laugh at the ""steamy love"" scenes...they were just stupid.",1443830400,,286,4.836734693877551
6643408,4,B00NCDVVLY,"Not at all what I had imagined. (I haven't read the book.)  I thought there would be a lot more sex from the get go. The movie was so complex. I loved the slow build, how he won her trust, and the development of the characters. I especially liked Anastasia's innocence and trepidation yet her willingness to be vulnerable and explore while at the same time being so grounded and fierce in knowing and holding to her boundaries. She submitted yet didn't fold in the face of a very powerful, dominant and masculine man. And Christian had just the right amount of tenderness to his character that I was able to understand why she was drawn to him and was willing to withstand the intense emotional confusion of their relationship. Loved the very last scene as well.

I am not into S & M, hence the reason I never read the book.  But curiosity eventually got the best of me so I could understand what all the hype was all about.  I watched it with an open mind and really enjoyed it but realize that parts of this movie could be very disturbing for some people.  For what it is worth, my friends preferred the book to the movie.

The acting was awful!  Both Dakota Johnson & Jamie Dornan need acting lessons. In my opinion Eloise Mumford would have made a better Ana. It wasn't a romance, I'd call it more like a cheap porn.

6643440,3,B00NCDVVLY,"The movie wasn't as bad as I was expecting. Kelly Marcel (screenwriter) and Sam Taylor-Johnson (director) did an astounding job of adapting the source material. When I finally watched the movie, I was shocked that they were able to take what I believe is an utter crap book, and make it into something that is palatable. The soundtrack also helped. The music within the movie, and the soundtrack itself, is nice. I can honestly say that I've liked almost all the songs off the soundtrack, and most of the music present in the film fit the scenes.

The sex scenes weren't mind blowing or graphic which was fine with me. I know this wasn't okay with some fans of the book, however having graphic sex scenes would have meant an NC-17 movie (i.e. it wouldn't have been able to be released nationwide). Plus, who didn't know there would be an unrated edition DVD/Bluray? I liked the changes Marcel and Taylor-Johnson made when it comes to BDSM and being safe, sane, and consensual. There are several points where Christian asks Anastasia if she is enjoying herself, and goes over their safe words. Anastasia in the film is nave and swept off her feet, but she still has a will of her own. It's still a modern fairy tale, but not as grating as the book.

The chemistry between the two actors is okay. I found that some of the people talking about the weird chemistry were some of the same people who were shipping Dornan and Johnson as a real life couple. However, Jamie Dornan did seem to be channeling his Paul Spector character on several occasions. Then again, Christian Grey isn't the most emotionally well-balanced person, so maybe it's just the material itself that makes for ""bad"" chemistry.",1443398400,,1693,4.677852348993288

So if your into whips and chains you may like this.  I am not but I went into this movie with a open mind and even with a open mind I still thought wow they could have paid me half of what they did for this movie and I bet I would have made one just as good if not better. The dumbest thing in the movie was at the end when they got into a argument and she said "" Find Christian I want you give me the worst you got, I want you to do your worst and what does he do he take off his belt and gives her a whooping. I mean you are in a room full of whips and chains. There was a paddle with spikes on the wall and the worst thing that you could do was whoop her with a belt? You could have at lest hit her with the belt buckle or choke her out and called her Steve but nope you whooped her across her behind with a belt. Please don't waste your time or money on this crap.

6643519,4,B00NCDVVLY,"I have read many negative reviews for""Fifty Shades of Grey,"" the movie. I must say that after reading the ""Grey Trilogy"" I enjoyed the film very much. I would even go so far as to say I liked the film more than the books. Call me weird!!

Based on  the highly successful 1st novel ""50 Shades of Grey,"" by E.L. James (It sold a total worldwide sale of 100 million copies),  the film tells the steamy story of young, attractive billionaire Christian Grey (played by""The Fall"" star Jamie Dornan) and the young, innocent and vivacious Dakota Johnson, (who appeared in ""The Social Network""). This erotic romance is a skillful distillation of James first book that captures the heady exhilaration of being someones fixation.

Anastasia Steele (Johnson), a naive but charming soon to be a college graduate meets aloof billionaire Christian Grey (Dornan) through an interview for her school newspaper. She literally trips into his office and looks up at his standing figure on her hands and knees. From the first moment she sees Grey she is intimidated but the sparks still fly. It takes Grey about 15 minutes into the interview, which he is initially bored by, to really take a personal interest in Anastasia. In his own way, sparks fly also.

Smitten, Christian pursues her until she ends up in his bed  but only because she drank too much the night before. Over a hangover-eliminating toast the next morning, Christian makes his intentions clear: he wants to become her Dominant, but not her boyfriend, and hed like her to sign a contract that will dictate the parameters of their sexual play. (BDSM is a variety of erotic practices or role playing involving bondage, dominance and submission, masochism).

The soft core scenes are tasteful but for the most part decidedly sensual. Anas erotic submission in Christians red ""playroom"" contrasts with her ongoing resistance to actually signing the contract. The room holds rack upon rack of cutting-edge bullwhips, a variety of high-end ass paddles, and more restraining cuffs than you can shake a stick at. And how much of this kit gets used? A mere fraction, and even then Christian, supposedly the maestro of pain, can do little more than brush his cat-o-nine-tails over Anas flesh with a feathery backhand....most of the time. There are some not so nice graphic scenes.

This is a move that leaves open the possibility for Anastasia to negotiate a more open and emotionally vulnerable relationship with her new bedroom partner. Christian has never encountered this resistance before & is intrigued. Ana is funny, smart, always quick with a quip and definitely not your usual Submissive. Her personality is a mega-improvement over her unassured, lacking in self esteem persona from the book. Ana is free, in a safe environment, to explore her dark side. However,  the further Ana concedes to Christians sexual wonts, the less satisfied she becomes. She wants ""MORE!""

There is no women abuse or rape here! Christian never does things that Ana does not approve. If she says ""NO, or the safe words ""YELLOW"" & ""RED, all activities STOP ASAP. Even at the end of the first book,  Christian never does things that Ana does not approve of.

The film is well acted, not too long, and somberly photographed, by Seamus McGarvey. It IS better than the novel, IMHO. And best of all, one gets to actually view the expressions on the characters faces. Christian becomes more likeable, more vulnerable than in the book...his emotions are clearly shown on his face. Same with Ana. And the romantic element, originally a ""no no"" from Christian, develops in a way that the audience can feel. Even the humor comes across better than in the book....one can sense & see the timing and reaction.

Overall, I recommend this film to anyone who enjoyed the ""50 Shades Triogy. HOWEVER, one can also enjoy the movie very much without reading the books. A most unusual, intense romance plus!

6643610,5,B00NCDVVLY,"This is a wonderful series... Sure there is s sex, some of it different than most people see familiar with, but moreover it is a Wonderful LOVE STORY.. Ana teaches Christian how to love himself..Something quite different from all he had ever known.. They both learn alot from the other.. It is one of the most beautiful love stories of all time.  Once you get into the real story and put the sex where it belongs, I know you will enjoy the growing love story, his tenderness to her, her willingness to learn from him you will find this beautiful tender love from each of them... my favorite. In this trilogy is the third book...  I am now patiently waiting for the second of three movies to be made.. If the movies are even close to the books wow. We are in for a real great treat.....  I truly hope she continues to write...It would be a terrible waste if she didn't....She has a writer's mind with a lovers twist.....THAN YOU FOR YOUR DEDICATION.......",1442016000,,954,4.471264367816092
6643611,5,B00NCDVVLY,"I think these two actors were perfectly cast.  Good movie, but I do think the book was better.",1441929600,,94,4.222222222222222
6643612,5,B00NCDVVLY,"As a big fan of the movie, I preordered it on Amazon right when it came out. The script was bad, but people seem to say their acting was bad. I disagree, I don't believe people who disliked the acting would be any good at acting, so its best not to say anything.

The screenwriter was a bad choice. Im so happy they chose a new one for the next movie!!! Hopefully it will be good, I'll buy it regardless because of the actors <3

Dakota Johnson was a great actress and so was Jamie Dornan, they acted as they should. Anastasia Steele in the movie wasn't desperate like in the book. I was a bit annoyed with Ana in the book, but Dakota made Ana adorable and funny. Their chemistry made me love the movie and thats whats important. I can watch the movie 10x and not get tired of it. On the 4th time already since the movie came out in theaters :P

Cant wait for the next movie in 2017!",1441929600,,883,4.092485549132948
6643613,3,B00NCDVVLY,"To be honest, I had very low expectations for this movie, but just had to see.  And see it I did today.  I won't give away any of the plot devices except for one, so don't read on if you don't want a spoiler.

This was a well thought out film.  The acting was so much better than I thought it would be.  The chemistry between the two main characters was very good.

This film would have garnered a 4 star rating except for:
1.  This was the same plot as 9-1/2 Weeks, just different character backgrounds and sex scenes.  I did enjoy the fact that there was more character development in this movie than in 9-1/2 Weeks.
2.  I'm a romantic at heart and would very much have liked to see the characters work out their differences or at least have a somewhat happy or hopeful ending.  I haven't read the books yet, so maybe that is the actuality and the other movies will catch up.

If the ending had been done differently, this was a movie I would have wanted to own.  As it is, I'll have to wait and see how the other movies are to make a final decision.",1441929600,,1052,4.12807881773399

times I think they should have put 1 and 2 together  the second part of the book got some drama. The first book should not have been a movie, it had no story line and the actors were very dull they did not have that OMG about them. Christian was suppose to dominate a room he did not do that for me he was cute but for another movie roll i feel so bad i don't like to be that person to be negative. They really should have done one and 2 together i know it is about money but that is not right either but i still love my fifty shades of grey books now those i will give a 10 star to",1441929600,,734,3.6392405063291138

6643616,1,B00NCDVVLY,"Women listen, the only reason females see ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" as a love story is because the movie plays ""sensual love music"" by R&B singers like Beyonc while a very good looking man copulates with a very good looking woman.  The movie is really just one big date showing a rich man breaking down the morals of a decent woman.  How does he do it?  He does it through manipulation; giving gifts, being kind and attentive, and in other words...pretending to be ""her man.""  I have met men on dates similar to Mr. Grey (without the sadism) who start out telling me exactly what they wanted from me, and the only thing they left out was my payment.  The movie is clear and beautifully filmed with decorative apartments overlooking the city.  The dialogue is modern and sharp, and only once did the movie seem outdated.when Ana explained to Christian her computer was broken, so she could not email him.  I guess email accounts had not yet been added to cellphones.  E.L. James, the author of the book has been able to deliver her personal touch to the story, and it almost seems she has written an autobiographical novel.  What woman would not be attracted to a man who is rich, good-looking, and attentive...oh, and let's not forget ""sadistic.""  Whether this movie will set the Womens Liberation Movement back a thousand years is yet to be seen because many women have already taken steps backsleeping with men on the first date after only a cheap dinner and a glass of wine.  Maybe E.L. James wrote the book just to wake women up and allow them to see just how un-liberated they have become since 1960s...she is trying to tell us it was not us who were liberated, but the men who were liberated.  Now, men no longer have be protectors of a woman's virtue.  They no longer have to be concerned about offending their new dates by asking them to strip, bend over and hold on.",1441929600,,1872,4.535714285714286

6643717,3,B00NCDVVLY,"Amazon made a big, fat hairy deal about ordering quickly in order to get the ""Unrated"" version.  I always try to get unrated versions because they usually contain more scenes/footage; more of what the director's vision of the finished product was supposed to be.  Somehow, I ended up with the ""R"" rated version.  I know I ordered the former, but I might have checked the wrong box, Amazon having employed every confusing means of bait-and-switch that they are so proficient at.  So the movie, in its theatrical release, was good, but I feel I can't comment on the film itself, having not had the opportunity to analyze for myself what the original intent of the director was.  With so many people following the book and so many eyes tuned to how it would translate to screen, I missed a good opportunity.  All because of pure cussedness on the part of Amazon.

6643781,2,B00NCDVVLY,"While the characters were picked out greatly to portray from the book except for Christian's sister( In the book she was more talkative with Ana). It was just too controlled, nothing seemed natural about the romance and it was too rushed and although that's how the book kind of portrayed it, it took a little bit more before Ana trusted him. And the bike scene when Ana is told to leave Christian alone... Totally rushed, it was more intense than that. The sex scenes were not as bad, all they did was show her and his booty lol. If we'd seen his umm stuff it would be sort of a porno. But it just left me wanting less of them in bed, and more of the from the book capturing the romance",1441065600,,687,4.212121212121212

6643788,4,B00NCDVVLY,"I read the 50 Shades trilogy a few years ago when EVERYONE was talking about it and was not at all impressed. The writing was poor and some of the lines were very cheesy. The idea was interesting though, and I felt there was a story there, just not well told. I was among a long line of girlfriends that decided to go out and watch 50 Shades when it came out in theater to see how Hollywood had adapted the story on screen. I was actually very impressed! My husband didn't like the movie AT ALL and couldn't understand why any female would be interested in being abused. I think that is what made me like the movie though. It really did a good job of showing the main characters being torn between several conflicting ideas of right and wrong, desire, sex, and control. They were vulnerable. Also, Hollywood didn't downplay the issue of BDSM going too far and what it does to someone not ready to be submissive. Lastly, I liked that the movie had a lot of comic relief. The story needing to be told could get very awkward and very heavy and the author made the characters come to life well.",1440979200,,1090,4.321951219512195

I definitely would have chosen a taller and better looking actor to play Mr. Grey. All he had going for him were his eyes and nice waist.

I'm reading book two now (then book three) I'm not really expecting anymore movies from these books. The movies would be too predictable. At least change up the ending so we don't get bored with the storyline. Don't get me wrong, I fully support the author of the books.

On the other hand, the quality of the movie is not the best. I've watched the movie on Demand and the quality and view is much better.

6643878,4,B00NCDVVLY,"The book was mind porn and anyone who's read it is going to feel an interpreted visual representation will fall short because nothing will live up to the hot and steamy story rooted in their mind's eye. This film, however is surprisingly faithful to the book.  It was well paced and the narrative included the appropriate scenes to convey what were needed to condense a 530 page novel into a two hour movie.

The biggest problems were the acting and consequently the chemistry between the leads.  Dakota Johnson's Ana lacked the energy and spirit that attracted Christian in the first place. Jamie Dornan as Christian was flat.  He used the same expression (resting bitch face) as the billionaire CEO, frustrated lover and the vulnerable young man who was damaged at a young age.

When they finally come together it becomes sex scenes by the book, mechanical and lacking sensuality.  I should have been uncomfortable with the scenes as a voyeur into their intimate moments.  Instead, I thought about the superior cinematography and editing.

I've never seen Ms. Johnson's work so I can't compare her acting ability against something she's done in the past but I love Jamie Dornan.  He does stoic very well.  If you watch him in The Fall (Irish BBC series with Gillian Anderson) you'll see the underlying menace in his portrayal of a serial killer.  There are tiny things he does that send chills up your spine. As the police get closer to apprehending him you watch his character's armor crumble.  That is so necessary for the role of Christian Grey yet is no where in sight within this motion picture.

This leads me to believe the director, Sam Taylor-Johnson and/or author, EL James insisted they underplay the roles.

Don't expect much and you'll be pleasantly surprised.",1440460800,,1775,4.873333333333333

I SO wanted to like this movie, but like most other adaptations, it was a huge disappointment.  Christian and Ana did not look anything like I pictured, the acting was not very good and overall the production felt very juvenile. It seemed very slow in some parts and rushed in others. The actor that portrayed Christian seemed emotionally flat. The actress portraying Ana did well in some scenes but she just seemed too plain.  My husband, who didn't read the books, felt lost instantly and said it felt slow.  He also said that it seemed like it was made for teenage girls, which I would NEVER let my daughter watch.

I was so hyped once I saw it that I even bought Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy books. I'll admit that some scenes felt a bit rush, but I feel like they did a good job putting everything together in a two hour movie. They definitely stayed true to the books. I wished some scenes from the book could have made the cut to be placed in the movie, but there can only be so much and I still loved it.

The actors have no chemistry as lovers, they seem almost uncomfortable. Anastasia feels absolutely no attraction towards Christian, she seems almost annoyed with him the whole time. They play off the ""innocent"" ""Young"" Anastasia and its a little creepy really, her giggle and all it is not how it is portrayed in the book, yes young not creepy. (Not a huge fan of the books since it gets repetitive quickly) Christian seems a better pick for the role however he does seem a bit 'robotic' and uncomfortable as well, maybe the effort put into his american accent has something to do with taking a toll in his performance. Anyway, great graphics & definitely a big budget production, but more hype than it deserves. What I like the most was the idea of Christian's lavish lifestyle and success, helicopter, glider etc LOL now THAT was cool LOL",1439510400,2,986,4.672413793103448

I've yet to finish the 2nd book but only because of the character Ana her immaturity kinds irks me but I'm planning to finish it before the 2nd movie comes out. I bought this movie on amazon I have watched numerous times. It's not that bad. Also I've listen to the book Grey on audible and it actually puts somethings in perspective.,1439510400,,482,4.193548387096774

As a film enthusiast I do not agree with the directors take on the film, however it was not a bad film.  I enjoyed it and I thought the sex scenes were appropriate for film with out making this a full pornography film.  I do not agree with the way Christian Grey was portrayed, I would have like to see more character development to describe his motives and actions better.  However, Dakota Johnson's was spot on as Anastasia Steele and I look forward to the second film.",1439510400,,582,4.216216216216216

Why did I love this movie so much!!!???Because like the book this movie made horrible look like an art form! And if a person can forget their scruples and feminist ideals, and strong opinions on a healthy relationships at the door... Then you too can find this movie as amusing and as entertaining as I did!!!
Important note!!! This movie is not sexy AT ALL! ( the sex scenes are beyond boring (I actually skipped over most of them in the book)... Christian is also NOT sexy! He actually reminds me of a half witted serial killer who is stalking his prey in the most awkward way possible.... And Anastasia is DOA at best (I was sad we didn't get any of her lame inner monologue... Dare I say my inner goddess was disappointed...) And the cheministry between the actors was non existent... Like that shizzle couldn't even have been lit with a blow torch.... But I tell you all this made the movie that much more EPIC!!!

6644075,3,B00NCDVVLY,"I have conflicting thoughts on this film. Having read the books, I waited a long time to see the film, assuming that it wouldn't follow them well. I was right. If you're a fan of the books, this may not be for you. I found myself frustrated at the silly, needless changes they made. I frequently find this is the case with book adaptations, however. Still, changes both small and large (including the end) seriously bothered me. On the other hand, I would assume that if you see this without having read the first book, it might seem disjointed. The ending would either be really frustrating or force you to read the books. So in the end, I can't really recommend it to either camp, book readers or non. I can say that it's not a terrible film if you know what you're getting into (lots of skin ... referring to unrated version ... haven't seen the other) and you like romances with deeply flawed characters.",1439510400,,908,4.475903614457831

OMG just like 20 minutes in and I was non stop laughing. I knew it was based off of Twilight fan-fiction but I had no idea how close it would be to the Twilight movie or books.

Never mind the red room and everything else beforehand. I know that it wasn't going to be much since she negotiated so much of the contract but really, that was all?

To me, it felt like this is a movie made for fans of the book. If you haven't read any of them, you can pick up on a few things but miss a lot of the important things. I kept asking my wife questions throughout the movie, which means they didn't explain things well enough.

The acting was definitely subpar. While there were some steamy, well done scenes, even my wife commented during trailers and other parts that ""the actors are simply going through the motions"". For me, the chemistry simply didn't seem strong enough between the two main characters. In fact, I only finished about 2/3 of the movie because I was bored with the premise.

6644269,5,B00NCDVVLY,I loved this movie. It had nothing to do with porn; it's all psychology. The relationship between Christian and Anna is very interesting - mostly because of Christian's childhood memories. I can't wait for the next one to come out!,1438732800,,231,4.8

6644276,1,B00NCDVVLY,Well there's two hours I'll never get back. My suggestion to anyone thinking of watching this movie is to watch porn instead. At least in porn there is far less whining and the characters try to be likeable. The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that now I don't have to waste my time reading the books. I haven't seen anything this bad since I was forced to watch Twilight.,1438732800,,390,4.283783783783784

6644310,5,B00NCDVVLY,"Ok.. I know I gave this 5 stars and I ought to be ashamed but I'm not.

1. Yes we all know that the book is no Tale of Two Cities but was it ever going to be? No. It isn't meant to win prizes it is meant to entertain and it did. And all you men moaning about how terrible this is, you should be grateful that your significant other appreciated it because I'm sure you got a little loving afterwards.
2. Ok, I didn't really like all the casting choices because *enter your choice here* would've been a better Christian/Anastasia. I think they did a very good job with a very difficult role. I'm not saying the characters are extremely complex but because of the popularity they were never going to please everyone.
3. I saw the theater release in the theater. The unrated version *sigh* let's discuss that. What the heck happened to the story? It was like they took every scene they cut from the theatrical release and just smooshed them together to make this edition. It was confusing, it didn't follow the story almost at all. It cut some of the most important scenes out to make the unrated version shorter. I would have rather they add all the deleted scenes and make the movie as long as day. It was almost unwatchable. If you don't want to add an additional DVD or Bluray to save money, then just put the deleted scenes as an extra on the same disc and we can watch them if we want.
4. I admit that this complaining is probably making you wonder why I gave 5 stars. Because I got this on Amazon Prime day and got a good deal. I'm not upset by the unrated edition. I still get to watch the original version which is a lovely guilty pleasure that surprisingly I am not at all ashamed of.",1438473600,,1690,4.248447204968944

I think it became a farce of itself after a while.  I actually bought all three books and became totally saturated with the story and the style before I finished the first book.

I think it was an interesting idea to write the same book from a different perspective, and I enjoyed it. But, it felt it was too much like a money making production, leaving you hanging. I would expect there to be 2 more books you will have to buy just like in the original set.

One reviewer hit the nail on the head: it's like an Audi commercial, beautifully shot, but lacks soul.  It was as if the actors left all the work to the director and design people and just woodenly recited lines.  No chemistry, no convincing passion, no convincing conflict.

I was surprised that I actually had fun with it. The character of Ana was very important. I was expecting a doormat but found her to be quite the handful and that was great. Early in the movie after Christian warned her away she didn't cry herself to sleep. Instead she was more like ""your loss, weirdo"". He was the one who had to keep coming back. Pure wish fulfillment. As for his being wealthy and powerful, I didn't get the impression she tripped much on that. She was also really piqued by his stalkerish behavior at times. Not to mention her reaction to his BDSM. In every instance he had to win her over.

[spoiler] The main problem I had with the story was despite non-stop talk about the contract, she never signed it before they go into the BDSM and punishment. The movie implied that Christian was so carried away by her that he deviated wildly from his usual approach to women. I suppose that is still wish fulfillment but it doesn't make it right.",1438214400,,1101,4.3707317073170735

He laid it all out for her very clearly and she knew what she was getting into, but continued all throughout the movie to be so confused and surprised that Christian meant what he said.

Everyone has made such a big deal about the sex part of it that I thought it was likely to be all about that with a cheesy story and acting behind it.... But, I can honestly say that the storyline was excellent.  It was dark and deep.  I watched this movie very intensly.  I related to Dakota and almost watched as if imagining being her.  The movie is so much more than a young woman obsessed with a hot guy.  Its about a young woman pulled from her normal life into an experience that confuses her emotions and thoughts and a man who is so deeply guarded that he has created a secret life for himself that only few see.  I thought the actors played their parts just as they should and I found myself deeply involved in their interactions.  I don't understand the negative reviews about this film or the acting.  Lately I find that movies that are rated 4 stars or higher by users generally are not that good and I just don't get it.  I held off on watching this film because of the reviews.  For me this movie did not turn out to be anything like they say (middle aged women sitting in theaters getting all hot and bothered). .. Bottom line, if you like films that have intense story lines and hope to be moved in some way then try this film.  I think most will either love it or hate it.",1437955200,,1349,4.186046511627907

I thought the female lead was very strong willed and not at all submissive.  She seemed to have more of the power than the guy who was supposed to be the dominant one.

When reading the book, you don't realize how ridiculous it is until watching it play out on screen.  I think everyone did the best they could, but this movie was BAD!",1437782400,,265,4.5
6644468,5,B00NCDVVLY,"This movie was something else.. She was so naive and he taught her well. She came back for more. But not for him to go that far with her. I don,t blame her for leaving. He is so handsome.",1437782400,,187,3.8205128205128207

6644470,1,B00NCDVVLY,"I can understand why this was a big hit, since it deals with an aspect of sexuality that is deemed taboo by most people. That being said, the acting was terrible, the story wasn't much better, and the characters were shallow and obnoxious. I spent most of the movie appalled at the female character for being a nitwit. The male character was basically a jerk. They should have just made this into a porno and been done with it.",1437782400,,427,4.417721518987341
6644471,2,B00NCDVVLY,"It is a sado-masochism relation. She is not too much into the masochism piece, but accepted it with the hope of change the dominant man. It is not a healthy, respectful relationship.",1437782400,,182,4.71875

6644497,1,B00NCDVVLY,This movie is 50 shades of wasting my time.  It was not nearly as good as the book and felt almost like satire.  We spent more time laughing & making fun of the actors than actually watching the movie.,1437609600,,201,4.128205128205129

6644504,5,B00NCDVVLY,"I'm buying this. Listen,  there are reviews that claim that this film wasn't worth the view but I can assure you that in my humble opinion for a two hour movie with plenty of all the right things,  this was awesome. I can not wait to read the series, it was extremely erotic to be an R rated movie. I know that there was much more that was excluded because any more would simply be too much for a film in cinema if you get my drift........ this movie was everything,  I'm surprised by how much I liked it in every way.",1437609600,,518,4.0588235294117645

I was just begging for her to either sign the damn thing or walk out on him.  Anyway, a couple of the sex scenes were a bit more graphic than I expected.  But I didn't care about either of the characters.  I feel like 2 stars is generous.",1437609600,,364,4.231884057971015

6644519,3,B00NCDVVLY,Don't like to review movies because one person's 'great' movie is another person's 'terrible' movie.  But Amazon has asked for my opinion.

I'll explain it like this... I thought it would be a bad A-class movie but it was more like a bad b or c-class movie. It was just soooooo bad, almost unbelievable it got the hype it got. Imagine no chemistry, corny characters/ corny interactions/ corny and over the top obvious innuendos, and Mr. Grey doing unspeakably GROSS not attractive things like smelling undergarments....

more satisfying. This was void of reciprocated love.",1437609600,,290,4.82

This one seemed to get bad reviews from lots of people, but I didn't see what they were complaining about.  To make a movie as good as the books, you'd have to give it an X rating and you'd find it in the back room of a video store or in a seedy adult bookstore rather than a regular movie theater.

6644647,2,B00NCDVVLY,"I never read the books so I am coming at this as just a movie watcher.  Rich mysterious seemingly perfectionist Mr Grey is enchanted and obsessed with Ms. Steele. He wants to lavish her with clothes, cars, a beautiful penthouse apartment among other things but control her life especially sexually.  I will tell you that the entire time I watched this I kept thinking I had seen it before..and perhaps better and I had done many years before in a movie that shocked audiences and critics alike and it was called 9 1/2 weeks.

In that movie the lead character becomes consumed with a woman who finds him mysterious and dark and becomes just as obsessed with him as he her and along the way they fall in lust and possibly love. Back to shades... I found the movie intriguing but I was not turned on. I found the characters interesting but I was not hooked on them. I found myself slightly involved but it was not a ""i cannot tear myself away from the screen type movie"".  The def left the door open for the sequel with a rather abrupt ending as Ms. Steele who upon finding out what Mr Grey does to those who disobey him walks out presumably of his life.

Of course, the books are poorly written quasi-erotica and an inaccurate portrayal of the BDSM subculture to begin with.

I think Dakota Johnson did very well, but I was less than impressed with the actor who portrayed Christian Grey.  For what was supposed to be the sexiest, steamy movie since 9&1/2 Weeks, this was a disappointment.  I've seen hotter stuff on daytime TV!  I've read the reviews of the book, here on Amazon, and I am glad I haven't read them.  I rented this with free digital credits I got from choosing the slow shipping speed with my Prime membership, so fortunately, this didn't cost me anything to watch.  This makes me happy, because, in a way, I wish I could get that 2 hours of my life back! LOL

6644693,1,B00NCDVVLY,"The movie made the characters a lot more callous and ignorant than the characters in the book. There was an aspect of internal change in Christian that this movie did not bring out, which is key to this whole relationship. The absolute main character of the book, Ana, was made to seem weak-minded and a just ""go with it' girl instead of the headstrong young lady that the book depicted. I fell in love with Christian's parents and the caring way in which they immediately took Ana into their lives. Christian's mother seemed to be some super rich, ultra stuck up doctor who couldn't be bothered with Ana in this movie. The other characters weren't really portrayed in the movie as well.

Even though there are some kinky parts I think it is a sweet love story. 2 people wanting different things from the relationship, having their own issues and differences  but in the end wanting to  be together and trying to find a way to make it work.
The movie did a good job of getting the main concepts into the scripts and keeping the two main characters true to the book's presentation.

The texting in the book was very funny and the movie managed to get some of that in also.
Hard to get everything and all the depth of the characters into a movie without making it too long. And this was only a 1/3 of the story!

6644788,4,B00NCDVVLY,"I'm so frustrated reading all the reviews from people who say this movie and the book are about abuse of women. It's actually about a strong woman who refuses to allow herself to be dominated. Christian is aggressive in pursuing her by giving her expensive gifts, but it's a stretch to call that abuse in the context of a fiction book/movie. Granted, in reality it would be creepy for a guy you hardly know to give you a computer or books worth a couple of thousand dollars, but that's not the type of abuse people are concerned with in the Fifty Shades stories. He's ""bossy"" about things like wanting her to eat healthy foods, but he's not threatening. Christian's prior relationships have been more straightforward BDSM with contracts and expectations clearly delineated. Anastasia never agrees to sign his BDSM contract and never participates in any activity without consenting. She makes clear exactly what she is and is not willing to do. At the end of the first book/movie, Christian is rough with her after she asks him to be, but that really happens only once. She is never injured and is free to walk away at any time. The only true abuse in the stories is what was done to Christian as a child. Anastasia helps him heal from that and helps him learn how to be part of a normal, loving relationship. She is the stronger of the two characters. The majority of people who object to the book(s) and/or movie because of abuse have not read the books or seen the movie.

As for reviewing the movie, I think it portrayed the book extremely well. It would not appeal to someone who had not read the books, because it does not stand alone as a full story. The ending would leave you thinking, ""What the heck?"" if you have no idea what comes later. As for the sex, I frankly thought it was rather tame in comparison to the books. They could have been a little bolder.",1436918400,,1867,4.507374631268436

Rarely will I ever say a book is better than a movie, but the key element that makes the book such a success was definitely lacking in the movie. I am entirely let down by the absence of passion between the characters that play Ana an Christian.

6644935,4,B00NCDVVLY,"I borrowed this movie surreptitiously for a guilty pleasures, trashy movie night at home. I tried reading the book at one point and did not even last long enough to get to the ""good"" parts. (See my review) At this time, I was willing to surrender 2 hours of my time just to see what the fuss was all about.

Did I enjoy myself? Yes. Is it a romantic movie? Not really. Did Christian scare the beejeezus out me? YES.

Make no mistake  any sensible woman would run for the hills if they had a Christian in their life  and I'm not talking about the BDSM fetish. I mean his stalkery, emotionally stunted, obsessive persona.

So why did I enjoy this movie more than I thought I would? I would have to give credit to the director, Sam Taylor-Johnson. As I understand it she battled with E.L. James to make the story, shall we say, less stupid. Taylor-Johnson didn't completely win, but she succeeded in making me very interested in what happens to the characters on screen AND not making me want to hurl things at Christian Grey.

I also have to credit Dakota Johnson for making Anastasia's character much less irritating than she was as I remembered her. Dakota was believable and even likeable. Her Anastasia had enough charm so that I didn't have to wonder  what the hell does Christian, let alone anyone, see in her???

Now, as to Jamie Dornan's Christian  he certainly looks very good, when he's not staring from the screen like a creepy psychopath. He did as much as he could with the material.

Bottom line  the movie did a good enough job that it made me want to brave reading the book again. That is no small feat.",1436486400,2,1617,4.447457627118644

Ana, a clueless virgin (who somehow knows nothing about the modern world despite being a college graduate), is stalked, harassed, belittled, and abused in every way possible - physically, verbally, emotionally, and sexually - by Christian, who apparently gets away with it because he's rich and attractive. if you know anything about real BDSM, you won't find it here: he ignores her safeword, pushes her into things she doesn't really want to do, gets her to sign a ""slave contract"" and expects it to be binding, uses tools and implements in the wrong ways at the wrong time, and there is no aftercare, no scene negotiation, no respect at all. it's painful to watch, and insulting to the BDSM/kink community at large. ""SAFE, SANE, AND CONSENSUAL"" is not something you'll find here - the horrific and appalling romanticisation of abuse IS. if you want a good BDSM flick, watch Secretary (with Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Spader). if you want a controlling, arrogant, manipulative a-hole with too much money and no compassion or sense abusing a helpless, brainwashed victim for the better part of two hours (or if you just like retching), give this a go, you won't be disappointed. absolute trash dreamed up by a fan of another abusive relationship - the one featured in the Twilight books.",1436486400,,1381,4.931330472103005

6644969,3,B00NCDVVLY,"I will start by saying that I read the books. I thought they were OK, but extremely redundant. As for the movie, it was also just OK. I know the actress that played Ana was named Dakota, although I don't recall her last name. I think she went a little overboard to convey the naivety of her character, and almost came across like she had some sort of mental problem. In the books, she was a plain Jane. In the movie, she is homely and ignorant. I think the actor who played Christian (again, can't recall names) did a little better of a job, but their level of ZERO chemistry made his job almost impossible. It definitely isn't a movie I could watch more than once. It kind of reminds me of a rip-off of the Twilight movies, just add in a few whips and a set of handcuffs.

The sound-track is ill-fitting and far from as exciting as the clip on the original trailer.  I literally counted the days until this film's release from the moment it was announced.

6644973,3,B00NCDVVLY,"********** SPOILERS BELOW **************************

What a surprising film.  People expecting an overheated romance with a playful backdrop of BDSM may be disappointed.  I haven't read the book, but unless I'm mistaken, the book is an easy-to-read steamy love story and not much more.  This film, as Ana might say, is so much more.  The filmmakers have picked through the trappings of a steamy romance and like talented prospectors cleverly turned it into statement about sexual politics and control.  That's not a new idea for a film, but for this film it's surprising.  Make no mistake, there is warfare between the lead characters, although it's subtle enough to be missed if the viewer isn't paying too much attention.  Christian wants complete control and sex on his terms without ""doing romance"" or even allowing Ana to touch him without permission.  He can't/won't let her in on what's going on with him emotionally, or his past, or basically.. well, anything.  He seems to want the shallowest possible relationship but (of course) with kinky sex.  Sadly, the kinky sex isn't even a source of fun for him -- it's deadly serious and a need, not a want.  Ana is sexually inexperienced and a romantic, but basically wants a deep emotional connection.  She also wants the trappings of a loving relationship -- she wants to sleep in the same bed as Christian, she wants to touch him without having to ask permission, she wants to cuddle, and she wants to connect with him on a deep level, but Christian can't give her any of these things.  Basically, the relationship is hollow and unsatisfying for Ana.

Once Christian gives Ana a contract to read and (he hopes) sign detailing what he wants their relationship to be, he's handed her the keys to the kingdom and has pretty much lost control.  She taunts him a bit with her new-found power, and strings him along until an overheard conversation about how desirable he is wakes her up and makes her realize she has to concede a bit.  There is so much power here in little Ana's hands, she's able to best Christian in an arena in which he most certainly is a master -- the business meeting.  I enjoyed the back and forth, and most of all, I enjoyed the fact that this movie surprised me.  I loved Dakota Johnson's performance, and I enjoyed how Ana asserts her independence throughout the film.  When Christian dances with her, she breaks away and does her own little dance independently of him.  I shouldn't be surprised how fun she is to watch and how natural she is based on her pedigree, but I was.  On the other hand, Jamie Dorman lacked so many attributes I find attractive in a leading man, I found myself watching only Ana during scenes and as a straight woman, I guess I should have been watching Jamie.  I do get that Christian is a repressed sort, but Dorman lacked intensity, charisma, and sex appeal he should have brought to the character.  He was completely stiff, and not in a fun way.

Things I didn't like -- well, the BSDM element is certainly in bad taste in these times, considering the worldwide problem of human trafficking, and the high percentage of women who are its victims.  I also hated the scenes in which an effort seems to have been made to visually present Ana as a child.  In particular, there is one scene in which Christian carries Ana out of their ""playroom"" that I found highly disturbing.  Even though the actress is in her 20s and the character is old enough to be a college graduate, the film is visually telling us that she is a child.  Considering that this comes after a BSDM sex scene, it nearly made me ill.  Also, some of the character inconsistencies (so is Ana shy and awkward or is she making snide remarks when first meeting Christian and interviewing him?) bothered me, along with the corny dialog such as ""I'm incapable of leaving you alone"".  Furthermore, I thought I was going to get the so-bad-it's-good awfulness I expected from this film after the first few scenes, as the circumstances even within the universe the film created were ludicrous.  Ana's roommate can't find anybody on the school newspaper staff or journalism class to interview the most eligible billionaire in the world?  Really?  Also, the character of Christian contained so many elements of a disordered personality he became hard to watch.  By that I mean stalking, breaking and entering, trying to isolate Ana, etc.  In the real world, Christian needs intensive therapy.  But I'm placing my bet now that in future installments, ""the love of a good woman will cure him"".

It's my understanding that the filmmakers are (for the most part) not interested in working on the sequels.  I totally understand this -- they had their say and the original released version of the film ended just the way that it should have -- there is nothing more for them to say.  Never fear though, the extra scenes thrown into the unrated version have convinced me that future installments will be more in line with the book, and less in line with a clever reworking of tired romantic clichs.

Now about the book -- I hadn't planned on reading it until I learned that the author's success began in the world of fan fiction.  She must constitute a threat of sorts to the established publishing industry, based on the vitriolic reviews I've read.  She also may have further paved the way for amateurs in the industry, something of which I heartily approve.  I don't write fan fiction, but I know many who do, and they generally toil for the sheer love of writing, without any real expectation of mass success.  Recently, I read an article about an outside-of-the-industry fan who was invited to formally pitch a TV idea for a very famous franchise, and I have to wonder -- has E.L. James' success forged a wider path for those outside the industry?  If so, I say kudos to her, and for that reason alone I plan on purchasing the series.

One last observation:  It's too bad the name of the book and film isn't ""Fifty Levels of Grey"" -- just think of the fun we could have with that acronym.",1436400000,2,6045,4.669187145557656

Watch anything else that Jamie Dornan has done, especially The Fall and New Worlds, and sadly you will be disappointed in his performance here. Like the editing problems with the books, this is great stuff but could have been so so much more. This movie is all about Ana, Ana, Ana. I think the director was so focused on getting Dakota through the Red Room scenes and developing her character, she did not direct Jamie at all. I think he was left pretty much to his own devices, and Taylor-Johnson could have gotten so much more out of him. Just 10  minutes of The Fall will make this abundantly clear. I also think he was distracted by having been cast just 30 days before shooting started, by his new wife and new baby. I would hope that he will redeem himself in Darker and give the performance we would expect from one of today's finer actors. Having said that, he is so gorgeous I would happily pay money to watch him open a can of tuna.",1436227200,,1020,4.396825396825397

My face depicted varying degrees of um no, hell no, and RUN! I'm no prude, and I'm game for some experimenting, but Mr. Grey belongs on a therapist's chair. At least the film can platform the discussion of what boundaries and control are and how to deal in an abusive relationship. *Just to be clear, I don't think bondage is abusive, if done right, and whips would be too easy of a target for an abuse soapbox. There are plenty of signs of abuse in this film and I'm not being small-minded.

There were soooo many better choices with character, stature, sexiness etc. Consequently, I failed to see the book described charisma in the movie character so he just didn't come across as believable.

I think movie #2 is going to have to create something mighty magical !!!!

An intimate relationship shouldn't be about ""owning"" another person or setting rules for the relationship nor about dazzling another with one's money and the expensive things one owns. I'm glad Anastasia could finally pull out - hopefully damage-free.  At the same time, Grey is basically not happy with the world he's created for himself; it's not working for him in the long run.  Tied up as I was with the plot, I haven't been able to objectively critique the craftmanship of the movie itself apart from the story.  But I would have appreciated a more satisfying end to the story where Grey wakes up and makes a conscientious decision to seek a healthier romantic relationship.

The BDSM some might disagree I think the movie makes the Grey seem like he is using the women he buys her stuff and it does not seems she actually really wants to do this. I am sure the book makes a different spin but the bigger issue is would she do it if the guy was not rich. In the final punishment she did ask for it then she gets angry as he did it, at the same time he is a fool for doing what he did as it even goes against BDSM rules of not harming your partner and only doing it if they enjoy it this is from what I read about it.

I did not like the creepy mind control of the dominant character and his soon to be trained virgin rabbit, which he now possess in the quadrant of a non- loving relationship.

6645274,5,B00NCDVVLY,"I know it's hard for avid readers to wrap their head around a movie based off a book but doesn't follow it to the ""T"". To me the movie is based off the books loosely following the story but taking other avenues to get there. It's a good movie. I genuinely enjoyed it but if your only take from fifty shades is sex then you aren't going to be into it because your perspective is inaccurate. This is a story of a shy introverted poor girl who finds herself falling in love with a rich powerful man and actually enjoying the type of sexual play he likes. It is confusing and upsetting to her because in her head she doesn't feel like it's normal but her body responds to his kinky ways. He is not a using her they are consensual adults engaging in behavior that they both need to find a balance in. However, if you just want sex and are mad that they choose Jamie Dornan (still) then just stop reading the series and don't watch the movie but if you undrstAnd the books emotional journey then you'd like the movie.

I read all 3 novels several times and I have been so excited to see the novels come to life on the screen. I didn't read the novels for the sex scenes alone. The entire story line of how Christian grew up and how he became a dominant was intense and intriguing. Both Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan's portrayal of the characters were spot on. The chemistry portrayed onscreen was unbelievably hot! I can't wait for the 2 sequels even though I know the ending. Thanks to everyone for bring the book to life. Good job!

6645279,2,B00NCDVVLY,"I read Fifty Shades of Grey back when it was being written chapter by chapter as fanfiction and was curious how it would translate to film. Not so curious that I wanted to see it in the theater, so I was willing to wait until I could rent the movie- I watched it last night. 2.5 stars from me.

I didn't think it was a horrible film, but it wasn't very good either. It covered a lot of the material from the book, but I felt like it suffered from a number of issues and just felt off. The biggest problem, at least for me, was that the 2 lead characters seemed to have no on-screen chemistry together, and in a film like this, that was a necessary thing- they needed to sell the sexual attraction 100% and sadly fell way, way short of that. Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan just weren't compelling to me. I thought Johnson was okay, but Dornan came across as slightly wooden and flat (which is a shame because I have really enjoyed him in other roles- I know he can act better than this), and there was little to no electricity, no spark between Ana and Christian, something that really needed to be there to make me believe they had this incredibly intense attraction to one another, that would have both of them willing to change how they look at how a relationship should be.",1435795200,,1277,4.2987551867219915
6645280,1,B00NCDVVLY,"Didnt do anything to enhance the craptastic storyline that the book provided. Utter crap. I didn't think acting could get much worse than what Dakota  Johnson calls acting. She is awful. There was no passion between DJ and JD. JD though, is a good actor and I enjoy him in everything except this. Some men can pull off the cleanly shaven look, my husband is one of those. Some call pull off a mustache and some a beard and  the many variation of male facial hair. JD needs a beard or he looks creepy. The story was lacking, just as the books did. They didn't rate well for me either. So I was not surprised. I had a credit so that is the only reason I watched this. Happy I didn't pay for it.",1435795200,,692,4.156716417910448

6645309,3,B00NCDVVLY,"When I started reading these books, I might not have finished them, simply because I thought the writing was so terrible.  And while I realize there is a lot of controversy about this story, and everyone has a right to their own opinion, there IS an underlying story here.  There is a reason Christian Grey is the way he is.  I kept reading because I soon realized their relationship began to evolve into something more than what Grey wanted and was looking for.  That's what I liked about the whole story, that even as he tries to fight it, he does end up falling in love with her.  With that said, I didn't go see the movie when it came out in theaters because I thought the casting was wrong, but I did finally rent it a couple nights ago.  While Dakota Johnson fit her part, Jamie Dornan was not at all what I had pictured in my mind for the role of Christian Grey.  Not even close.  Dornan, trying to pull off that role, failed.  Ian Somerhalder, who I had never even heard of before the movie buzz began to circulate, would have been a much better fit.  There is nothing sexy about Dornan, and I felt his acting was too robotic.

In E.L. James' defense, about all the critics claiming this story glorifies rape and abuse, I disagree.  BDSM does exist, and has for probably
centuries.  If it's not your thing, it's not your thing, but there are women who find gratification in being submissive to a dominant.  If they didn't, they wouldn't agree to that lifestyle.  To each his own.",1435708800,,1487,4.395604395604396
6645310,5,B00NCDVVLY,In LOVED THIS MOVIE!!!! Yes there is always going to be people that have their options.  But what I really liked about this movie is that Ana is relatable.

Grey siblings are all adopted just like Edward family of vampire his father a doctor well instead the mother is... The major cheesy line I heard was ""are you going to make love to me now"" and ""you hit the nail in the head or head on nail"" poor choice in the movie. I did not find myself interested until the end she is desperate to make a connection as her feelings evolved and she realizes that he is not reciprocating the same. However what female enables a guy to layout the rules and expect a women to lay down and take it. Innocent virgin or not one has a mind. The logic of saying yeah okay you have full control no dating or commitment attached is laughable for me. I read the books after the movie and was astonished in how poorly written it was the flow was scattered and the movie had a better flow making or trying to make it normal. Interested how much is cut and rewritten in the last two books. I think the only reason the book got picked up is the author connection to TV.

I absolutely loved the music: Annie Lenox and Beyonce are amazing and I am not even a fan of Beyonce.
The movie, on the other hand, was a disappointment. The actors lacked chemistry and they are by far the least talented ones i have watched in an American movie. Everything felt forced and childish and they were not able to convey the relationship that the characters have in the book. Realistically i did not expect the movie to do the book justice, as it almost always is the case, but i did not accept this level of mediocre acting.

6645337,3,B00NCDVVLY,"This film is beautiful--expensive sets, pretty people, gorgeous locations, lovely camera work--and the soundtrack is excellent. The 3rd person objective perspective of the film fixes probably the most irritating aspect of the book, Ana's juvenile inner monologue (thank god, no voiceovers.) It is a great film for sitting back and watching the pretty, if you don't need to think about it too much. If you are inclined to think about it, you'll notice the holes, inherited mostly from the book. 1) Grey's attraction to Ana, or Ana's to Grey, is never explained. Apparently her worth as a submissive is supposed to be justified entirely by her klutziness, and this is supposed to motivate him to caretake; his attraction to her as a dominant is down to...money? Power? Pretty, pretty eyes? You never find out. 2) Dornan plays Grey as a 27-year-old; this is true to the basic outline of the character, but Grey is supposed to be an experienced dominant with 15 prior relationships. Unless these were one-night stands, he should be more confirmed in his habits than he is here, more dedicated to control; instead, he lets Ana put him on an emotional rollercoaster that makes him seem very young and less competent than one would like. 3) There are homages that seem longer and more obvious than they need to be--a spanking scene reminiscent of ""Secretary,"" a glider date pulled almost verbatim from the remake of the ""Thomas Crown Affair."" I got up to make a sandwich. 4) The film lingers lovingly on BDSM paraphernalia, at the expense of BDSM behavior. Leather cuffs do not, by themselves, a submissive relationship make. (See Lars von Trier's ""Nymphomaniac"" for a bondage scene that depends only a ratcheted tie-down strap, the kind you use on a pickup truck, a couch and a phonebook. Not at all pretty, but surprisingly effective, in all senses.) All in all, not a waste of two hours, but not a film I'm likely to watch again. For repeat viewing, I prefer the less glossy, but more character-driven, ""Secretary.""",1435622400,5,2011,4.883040935672515

6645339,3,B00NCDVVLY,"So my wife and watched this and of course there is some sex, still this is a commercially produced movie by a major studio, so it is still relatively tame compared to an art house movie.

Spoiler alert:

The movie itself is okay, 3 stars.  The take away for me about this movie is not about the sex or alternative lifestyle, it's a bigger life lesson.  I'll explain.  When the two lead character meet, the lead male character is explicitly clear about the kind of relationship he is looking for.  He is not looking for a girlfriend, to make love or have love.  The lead female actress is young an naive and she ends up in love with""the boy"".  When Christian does respond with the same wants or feelings, the movie ends with with Anastasia walking out upset and crushed.  I think of my own life when I was much younger and dating and too often when we are young, we date the wrong people thinking they will change into what we want them to be, most of the time this won't happen.  I am not saying that people won't grow or there won't be some change as people grow older or a relationship matures, but when someone is clear upfront about who they are or what they want and it doesn't align with what you want, I think it better to move on and find someone that is more in line with what you are looking for.",1435622400,,1306,4.229838709677419

I watched it with open mind but I was disappointed.  It doesn't measure up to the beauty of the books.
The acting was poor and boring.  The writing was shamefully trite.  There's more passion and sex on netwok TV.  The scenes were choppy and characters from the book were left out which I think was a mistake.  The characters included in the movie were dropped into a scene and yet added nothing.

Yes I watch it with my girl friend who said so much of the movie was in line with the book, even the dialog matched up. Why critique? Well someone had the idea to make this movie and agree to star in said film. A lot of hype over what should have been called 50 shades of yawn. I get it really is written to a younger audience; one that has a limited sexual experience. I mean in general, after all engaging or not in power driven sexual encounters doesn't matter as much as having a reference point and understanding of your own desires. This is something one hopefully develops with time.

My bigger issue with the book is the complete joke of a 27 year old billionaire who is somewhat self made, with some rich adoptive parents for help.  He is beautiful man with such insight to others. Running a telecom among other things, not a tech geek who did make his own billions. Of course he plays the piano, is rich, beautiful, understands the subtleties of the human condition and worked through his childhood issues of abandonment, seduced straight into a world of bondage and submission at age 15.

In the beginning, there was no transition from Ana being naive and innocent to being caught up in lust for Christian.  She started out like she was already in the middle of the relationship.
Didn't really like the ending, although of course it leaves things open for a sequel.  Don't know how it went in the book, but in the movie, Ana baits Christian.  She tells him to do what he does so she ""can understand him.""  So he does what she wants, which she could have stopped at any time, and then she leaves him!

Specially Dakota Johnson. Definatly not the right female for the job. I guess that is my biggest disappointment--how fake it all seemed. Yes, they followed the book somewhat. Not much. But I kept looking for characters that were in the book that were never seen in the movie.

hasn't heard of 'E.L.James's' book '50 Shades Of Grey'
Literature Student 'Anastasia (Ana) Steele's' (Dakota Johnson) first meeting with billionaire businessman 'Christian
Grey' (Jamie Dornan) comes about by conducting an interview with him at his office on behalf of her flat-mate and
friend.
She becomes flustered by his charm and manner, he was not what she had expected and almost immediately feels
attracted toward him.
It is pretty obvious he is is equally taken by the nervous presence of interviewer and seems to want to be the one
asking the questions.
'Christian' makes it his business to learn more, and turns up at 'Ana's' place of work.
She is quickly seduced by 'Christians lavish life-style, romance seems to be on the cards..........
As 'Christian' has a need to protect both his image and interests he needs her to sign documents to say she'll never
disclose anything of their relationship.
'Christian' has deep secrets that 'Ana' will soon become familiar with and indeed a part of, but this is a strange type
of relationship, he has rules and needs, and presents her with a contract to read and agree to.
She will explore her wildest fantasies and learn of his expectations of how a relationship works for him, he has his
rules and always has a need to be in control........but, will she agree to his terms ?
'Ana' proves to be anything but the type of girl he's known in the past.....will he give more ground than he has ever
given before......
A romantic tale which has many moments of humour and is often mesmerising sometimes brutal and frequently
seductive as they explore and discover each others desires and indeed limits.
The film can be seen in either the theatrical cut or the unseen version.

6645549,1,B00NCDVVLY,"To anybody who's interested in watching this movie, skip it. It's misogynistic, perpetuates terribly and ill-conceived ideas about consent and problematic conceptions of what sex actually looks like (i.e. he touches her arm and she orgasms), is just a joke in terms of writing, plot, and character development... am I missing anything else? Oh wait, yes. If you find this sort of fantasy attractive or arousing in any sense, I would suggest rethinking how you think about yourself and relationships. Anastasia literally finds him attractive because he is attractive and rich and buys her a lot of things (I don't think he ever once smiles or shows any character trait that is actually swoon-worthy). Add ""the ability to critically engage with ideas"" to the list of things to rethink. The sexual aura around capitalism that you find in this movie is as disturbing as Anastasia's superficiality, as artificial as Anastasia's 1000 orgasms, as repulsive as Christian and Anastasia's understanding of consent, and as pathetic as how long it took Anastasia to fall head over heels in love with this guy (5 minutes into the movie).

6645580,3,B00NCDVVLY,"Fifty Shades of Grey is a film adaptation of the novel of the same title by E.L. James about the steamy tale of a college student who began a relationship with a young billionaire.

The movie have shown promise in the beginning and could have told the great kinky novel of E.L. James extremely well on the big screen. Unfortunately,it doesn't as it failed to deliver.

The screenplay focused too much on the masochistic relationship between Ana and Christian instead of providing depth into their characters. The film does not go in depth with Ana's character like her passion for Literature and why she waited for so long before entering into a romantic relationship that she was a virgin when she first made love with Christian. That goes the same for Christian as well as what made him successful as a business magnate at a very young age and why he would rather enter a loving relationships. It basically left the
audience wondering more about them. Also,it never fully explored what made Ana and Christian love each other and why Ana would allow herself to be manipulated sexually by Christian despite being uncomfortable with their so-called sexual relationship.

What's worse,the sadomasochistic sex scenes were simply horrible as they lacked realism. It was obvious that both actors are uncomfortable with these scenes and lack believability while performing them. Also,it was evident that both actors lack chemistry  and were never at ease with each other. Do I need to say more about their more intense erotic scenes?

The conclusion was lacking and left the viewers hanging as it ended abruptly. If I have not known that there will be up and coming sequels for the movie,I would have not forgiven them. Obviously,the film is definitely sequel baiting. LOL

If there is one positive thing that I could say about this movie,it is Dakota Johnson's performance minus the erotic scenes. She performed Ana's character with a lot humor and vulnerability. Also,we get to see her love and passion for Christian as shown in her eyes and body language. She definitely had a notable performance. Too bad that Jamie Dornan as Christian Grey could not compliment her at all that it made it seemed forgettable to the viewers as well.

Finally,it made a lot of money at the box office. This only proves once again truly sex sells no matter how poorly made the movie is.",1435104000,2,2364,4.865671641791045
6645581,3,B00NCDVVLY,"Note: This review contains NO spoilers

Fifty Shades of What am I doing with 125 minutes of My Life. As a person who hasn't read the book, I would say the film is a bit meaningless and therefore doesnt encourage me to read the books or follow up for Fifty Shades Darker. The unrated Blu Ray of the film was pretty and glittery but it lacked a certain of depth when I watched it.

I will start with the set design. While it is beautiful and well planned to fit their individual characters from Anastasia Steeles homely apartment to Christian Greys expensive red room, the characters played by Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan respectively. They were clich. Upon watching the Extras on the Blu Ray disk, the set and costume designers wanted to incorporate personality into attire. Anastasias room was simplistic and girly with shelves of books, a tribute to her personality as the inexperienced and innocent girl.  Her second room, in Christians apartment, is white with a cushiony bed, completely symbolic of a delicate female. A cute tidbit that caught my eye when they first entered the room, was the caged dove with an open door; a representation of Anastasia in the events of the movie. Christians apartment was what almost any girl would think her dreamy, billionaire boyfriends abode would look like: classy, large, almost designer, and stoic. Until you get to the red room, which showed Christians want for dominance and his seductiveness.

Now the actors in Fifty Shades of Grey, seemed to enjoy their rolls quite a bit. Their performances were well done for the roles needed to portray but the intensity of some scenes were overdone and felt nearly tacky because on certain occasions, there wasn't a need to have such a serious poker face. What bugged me the most was Christians intense gaze. Was that really necessary to show charisma? Homie, you look like a psychopath but otherwise, Mr. Dornans performance was spot on for what was required of that character; if I am correct that would be a serious, well behaved (in public), and to the point business man. Many of the side and minor characters had more appeal than the two stars of Fifty Shades; their performances were subtle yet effective and didn't need long periods of time to either be likeable or annoying.

While Fifty Shades of Grey has sparked much controversy for the BDSM community, I didn't notice abuse in the sex scenes or punishment scenes as Anastasia didn't scream Stop or No until pushed over the edge. Its probably more in the books. However, it was easy to spot the dominant, control freak that Christian wanted to play in Anastasias life.

The music picked for the audio helped set a mood and was paced well for the sex scenes but overall not very memorable. The setting was quite beautiful and captured Seattle in a way I wouldnt know, since Ive never been there but at first glance you would know it is Seattle. While there are bits of symbolism I could identify, Fifty Shades of Grey the film adaptation was at best flashy but not leave me excited for another film.

6645621,3,B00NCDVVLY,"The book was cheesy; the movie is even more cheesy.  I liked the books, but not loved them.  They were a bit contrived, but the characters were as least compelling.  The actors in this movie (or maybe the writing) did not create compelling characters that you could relate to.  The situations seemed too contrived and artificial.  The actors didn't really suit the roles as described in the book.  Grey is described as a handsome man with an air of mystery and seduction that makes women melt around him.  The acting didn't really live up to this persona and the actor seemed way out of his element.  He did not seem comfortable in this role at all.  Dakota did marginally better in her role, but still lacked the depth of the book's character.

These roles could have been real juicy parts for the right actors.  It's not clear if the fault lies simply with poor acting, or if the actors were stymied by the direction or writing.  The combination of all three didn't work that well and the scenes seemed too artificial.",1435017600,,1020,4.574585635359116

6645673,4,B00NCDVVLY,"Overall, I like the movie. I find however, that for all of hype and promotion of the movie, that it is a bit slow and plodding. The so-called ""suspense"" of many of the scenes is boring and predictable. And, it takes FOREVER for some of the plot elements (which I will not describe) to develop and reach their conclusions!!! The love scenes are often powerful and nice. The domination scenes don't seem natural or spontaneous. They seem practiced and ridiculous most of the time and Grey's fascination with her is powerful, but seems unnatural also. Actually, it seems as if I am panning the movie, but it did hold my interest, for the most part. It is not a movie I will want to watch over and over again...but now and again will do. :-)",1434931200,,737,4.466666666666667

6645690,1,B00NCDVVLY,"Everyone knows that ""50 Shades"" (the book) was originally ""Twilight"" fan fiction - Christian Grey is Edward Cullen and Anna Steele is Bella Swan.  She's the geeky nerd who can't quite seem to do anything right.  He's the uber-cool, cold-as-ice demi-god who always gets his own way.  It's a romance, but it's not - she loves him (of course she does!), but he's got issues.  And it's up to her - whether it's Anna or Bella - to make things right.

Anyone who knows anything about S&M will recognize right from the start that there's nothing about Christian Grey that suggests he's really a sadist.  In fact, as I was watching, I kept asking myself, ""Who's really the dominant here?""  Christian tells Anna all about his ""play room,"" with its shackles, whips, and chains, but nothing that happens in that room is in any way dangerous - or sadistic.  He hits her with feathers, slaps her gently on the rump, or ties her hands with silk scarves.  It's all very non-threatening, and if he's a sadist, he's a very good liar!

Ultimately, this is a movie about wounded men (poor Christian had a lousy childhood) and innocent women (Anna is a virgin when she meets Christian, and it's her pure and honest love that might - maybe - save him).

I say ""might"" because this is the first in what will be an intolerable number of sequels.  ""50 Shades"" has no real ending, because we need to come back for the next installment.  But it's abundantly clear that Christian Grey has never been in charge of anything - at least not where Anna is concerned.  So while Christian - or Edward - is super in charge of his own world, he has no control over his heart.  Yikes, is this dreadful, or what?

I watched the movie because I was curious; ultimately it bored me silly!  Had Anna really turned the tables and starting giving Christian a taste of his own medicine, I might have been interested.  But the ineffectual woman thing got old very fast.  Watch this for the absurdity of it.  If you're expecting anything else, forget it!",1434844800,8,2008,4.525

6645692,4,B00NCDVVLY,"I have read the book, so of course I expected the movie to be somewhat different.  I think the characters could have been more fleshed out (no pun intended) in the movie.  I felt it focused too much on the sexual aspect more than the underlying emotional conflicts both characters were suffering from.  I hope when and if they do the sequel that they put more time and energy into the underlying story.

6645747,1,B00NCDVVLY,"No.  I just.  No.  Okay before watching this I was concerned about the actress playing Anna, but she was not the problem in the movie even though she still comes across to me as much older than 21.  It was Jamie Dornan, he just was not Christian at all.  He seemed stiff, his acting and his personality.  I get he was trying to pull off the confident, closed off Christian Grey but that is not how I found his character to be at all.  Then because of that and in addition to major parts being left out it just made their relationship even more awkward than in the book.  I really enjoyed the books, read them twice.  I will admit they aren't some great piece of literature but they serve a purpose of offering a great escape and also introduced many women to erotica and made it okay for them to want to read it.  This movie though was just so hard to swallow.  It felt comedic which would have been fine if it was meant to be.  Dakota Johnson had moments of true comedic relief which was nice and not what I had issue with, it was the unintended comedic quality and ridiculousness of the movie.  They didn't build the relationship more which needed to happen because people who have never read the book definitely would not be able to believe the relationship, I read it and how they presented it in the movie was a very hard pill to swallow.  Truthfully I almost didn't finish the movie, I forced myself to though.  My husband an I ended up having many laugh out loud moments together.

The redeeming quality of the movie?  The music.  I love the music, bought the soundtrack.

Honestly I wish I had just rented this movie instead of buying it.  I don't think I could ever watch this again.  I am interested though to see if the next movies resolve the issues this one had.",1434758400,9,1775,4.318181818181818
6645748,4,B00NCDVVLY,"I thought this movie was so disgusting I don't how many times I going to have to see to determine the full amount of how disgusting it is. Dakota Johnson deserves  a good spanking. Serious now, movie moved a tad bit slow and it was interesting in the character development. MS Johnson looks like her mother Melanie Griffith. You see the evolution of the characters during the movie and the ending  leaves us hanging. A good conversation movie.",1434758400,,443,4.666666666666667

6645884,1,B00NCDVVLY,I can't believe I wasted my time watching this movie.  There is absolutely no story line and no character development; the primary focus being on the signing of a contract and the devices behind the locked door.  I recognize this genre does not make for greatness but this was a pathetic and banal attempt at sensuality.,1434499200,,320,4.696428571428571

6645900,2,B00NCDVVLY,The movie barely touched on many of the key elements of the books that made it a good read. Glossing over the inner struggles of the main character in order to focus on the nudity. It was like a game of hide and seek. You might catch a glimpse of an important scene from the book only to have the scene glossed over and end before we learned why it was important. You never got to know the story behind the messed up main character.  It was hard to watch. Kind of like reading the cliff notes to the good book....you know the basic story...but you do not understand the characters.,1434499200,,581,4.2342342342342345

6645906,5,B00NCDVVLY,"It's all relative, so you will have to decide for yourself! I love the fact that this is a DVD and Blu-Ray AND has a digital download option AND an alternative ending and unrated version AND bonus features! What more could you want?! :-) And if you want yet another review of the movie itself, this is a very open expression of a dominant/submissive relationship but moreover, at its very core, it is a love story -- make no mistake! :-) The acting is quite good and believable and I was mesmerized so much so that I am eager to see the next two movies based on the next two books! What can I say? I LOVED everything about it and want more! Pretty much nothing suits 100% of the people 100% of the time so if you like, give this trilogy your time. I see no reason to be negative about any of it. It's all G@@D and for many like me, it's all very, VERY G@@D and downright DESIRABLE!!! ;-)",1434499200,,887,4.162790697674419

6645908,4,B00NCDVVLY,The movie had no surprises.  It followed the book scene for scene.  I found that some key explanations were left out of the movie that might have  heightened the anticipation of this crazy love story.  Read the book first and all will fall into place.  Still hot and steamy.,1434412800,,274,4.510204081632653

6645918,4,B00NCDVVLY,We enjoyed the movie.  But we were a bit distracted by the sound problem.  The audio was a bit jittery throughout the entire movie.  It was a little bit distracting.  So we would have enjoyed the movie more if this problem had not been there.,1434412800,,242,4.311111111111111

6645920,4,B00NCDVVLY,"Well, after watching this movie, I have to say that I'm not as warped as I thought I was.  To be sure, BDSM has never been my gig.  Nevertheless, I approached this film with a sense of curiosity.  Needless to say, my curiosity was quenched.

Ana (played by Dakota Johnson) is a naive college aged woman whose life begins to cross paths with a rich billionaire named Christian (Jamie Dorman).  While Christian  has the social aptitude of a 12 year old, Ana nevertheless finds herself drawn to him.  Despite his apathetic view of life, he obviously has a business acumen, + he's rich & handsome.

Such is the framework for us to watch as Christian leads Ana to his dark impulses and rather demented way of looking upon relationships.  He does not want a girlfriend.  Rather, he needs a sub.  Is Ana capable of fulfilling that role?  Therein is the crux of the film.

Full disclosure:  the primary impetus of my wanting to watch this movie did not lay in its psychological foreplay.  Rather, I mainly just wanted to see Dakota Johnson naked.  I feared that it might be a classic ""teaser flick"" which shows ""everything but....""  Well, if anyone else has any of these same reservations, fret no more!  Dakota Johnson has an All-American, unassuming girl-next-door beauty, which makes her perfect for the part.  She also has a fabulous cheerleader body and the viewer gets to see all of it!  The flick hits a Grand Slam on that topic.

6645921,2,B00NCDVVLY,Very disappointed. I read the books and they are so much better. I didn't think there was much chemistry between the two main characters.,1434412800,,137,4.75
6645922,2,B00NCDVVLY,"Kudos to the female lead for earnestly acting her part, but the male lead left much to be desired. Having read the book (and, admittedly, I thought it was dismal), this movie is almost impossible to follow. Too many pieces of the plot are missing. I'm sorry I spent $6 on it. It's not so much the fault of the actors, of course. It could use much better screen writers.",1434412800,,369,4.285714285714286

6645931,1,B00NCDVVLY,"Unfortunately, the chemistry between Ana and Christian that drove the books to be readable is totally missing from the film, rendering it unwatchable. The love story comes off as about exciting as a cheese sandwhich, and as sophisticated. Unless you are a diehard uber fan of the 50 Shades series, this movie is a waste of time.",1434412800,4,328,4.771929824561403

6645933,4,B00NCDVVLY,"This movie followed the book very well. Even though there was a lot of hype about the book's sexual exploits, for me the book was a wonderful love story between a very strong nave girl and a guy that was very messed up.  I thought the movie did a great job of depicting their love story.",1434412800,,287,4.125
6645934,2,B00NCDVVLY,"Plot is lacking. I didn't read the book because I'm not a fan of reading but knew I should at least see the movie to see what all the hype was about. The sex scenes are good, but the story is totally lacking. Another rich boy saving a poor, insecure white woman only to realize it's not her that necessarily needs the saving. He also comes from a place of abuse, which makes it seem like BDSM practices are only carried out by those who are abused and need to abuse others to feel better about themselves, which I think is pretty unfortunate and paints a poor picture of BDSM practices in general. Again, this is just my opinion, but I didn't enjoy the screen story very much.",1434412800,,676,4.2890625

6645943,3,B00NCDVVLY,"I would say this, the book was horrible, so based on how awful the book is what kind of movie could it possible be. I think the director tried hard, really did not manage to do what could be, but I think it is the awful writer of the books who always seems to interfere. The movie was carried by Dakota Johnson who created a nice character. Ana in the book is boring, has no life, is totally not an interesting character, Ana in the movie is sweet, lovely and alive. I love Jamie Dornan, he is a talented actor, but I am not certain well cast in it. You can tell he hated being in it. And I will say this, the best part of the movie may be the soundtrack.",1434412800,,655,3.9696969696969697

6645946,1,B00NCDVVLY,"One of the biggest pieces of DUNG I have ever been suckered into viewing. In all honesty, the rental fee is not worth the time I wasted (which I will never have back). The acting was stilted and dull. The plot was tin-pan alley all the way. The dialogue was forced. Many times throughout the film you could see a herculean effort being made to seem erotic and exotic. Regrettably, it false way short of the mark. The ending strains to be mystifying, but it only add to the confusion that has been pent up by two actors that cannot find a chemistry and did not have any skilled directing to get them even half way there.

This film needs a heavy dose of literary Viagra because it's a tremendous let down...",1434412800,3,706,4.348484848484849

6646046,5,B00NCDVVLY,"Being a Christian, I was very skeptical of seeing this movie, especially with so many negative remarks and reviews. But when I tell you this movie is AMAZING! I really, really enjoyed myself and I really relate to Ana. I love that she becomes stronger as a woman and makes her own decisions about her sexuality and what makes her happy and what doesn't. I believe that's so powerful as a woman...to make your OWN decisions about everything involved in your life. I've never seen a movie where a woman exemplified such power and used her mind so much. The actors were flawless and the visuals were a treat. I first saw this movie on Demand but now I'm purchasing because it's that great!

I would also like to say that I can understand where people think this movie is abusive. It made me sad when Christian had a difficult time loving Ana. I can also understand that this lifestyle seems abusive and brainwashing....and yes, in my opinion, it can be, if the person is not strong-minded. You must be strong-minded to have a sex life like this. Anastasia has a strong mind, which is why she is always able to control the situation for herself. This isn't abuse. He isn't raping her or forcing her to take beatings. She's letting him because she wants to try new things, enlarge her understanding about things she doesn't know and discover her womanhood. And I think there's nothing wrong with that.

I think this movie should not be dismissed, even by Christians because it's great for discussion. And yes, I want a sex life like these two when I'm married, plus true love. :)",1434240000,,1574,4.578014184397163

The storyline is very similar to the 1980's movie ""9.5 Weeks"" with Kim Basinger and Mickey Rourke. The ending was weak and predictable for this type of multi movie series where they try to build anticipation for the next movie by leaving the audience hanging.

6646108,3,B00NCDVVLY,"The movie is a lot tamer than I was expecting and I enjoyed the consensual, romantic parts.  The violence was disturbing to me.  I've never been fond of unnecessary violence or violence for pleasure.  I wouldn't want someone to be aggressive towards me and I wouldn't want to be forceful to someone else.  This is especially true in the context of sex which should always be consensual and loving and if married on a regular basis.  I read that the story was originally a fan fiction posted on the internet and based on the Twilight characters, very odd, a porn fantasy converted to mainstream fiction.  I found the parts with text messages really annoying.  I don't like it when movies display text on the screen, it's either too hard to read or they don't give you enough time to process it.  I thought the ending seemed abrupt and confusing.  I wish there had been more content about Christian's childhood, his mother's abusive friend, the reason he won't share a bed, and his supposed ""emergency.""  I was surprised that Annabelle was reluctant to try some things and expressed her viewpoint, since she was shy and sexually inexperienced.  I was expecting aggressive dominance throughout the film.  The author, screenwriter, and director are all women.  The author's husband wants to write the screenplay for the second film.

6646134,1,B00NCDVVLY,"After how bad the Twilight books were portrayed in the movies, I hoped Fifty Shades would learn from their mistakes.  When I found out who was cast for Christian, I had serious doubts but decided to rent it anyway.  What a waste of time and money.  The movie was such a bad adaptation of the book.  I think with a good script Dakota could pull of a decent Ana, but Jamie is just not cut out for Christian.  The movie was choppy like most have said, but aside from the bad acting the script was bad, really bad.  The movie didn't have any of the sarcasm, humor and wit that I really liked in the books.  I'm not a fan of the BDSM parts of the book and would just skip or skim those.  I read the books because I liked the love story and I liked the characters.  Jamie didn't portray any of the confidence, humor, intelligence, arrogance in Christian.  Instead to me he just looked angry and confused all the time.  I hope that the sequels will be better but I sincerely doubt it unless they do some serious work on the writing.  My ideal Christian would have been played by Alexander Skarsgard.  After all Twilight is based on the Sookie Stackhouse novels (though Stephanie won't admit it but you would have to be an idiot to believe that) and Fifty Shades of Grey was fan fiction from Twilight.  True Blood is the only successful screen adaption for any of these stories and Alex's portrayal of Eric was spot on.  Fifty Shades of Grey Sequels - take a lesson from True Blood on how to do this successfully.",1434153600,4,1505,4.325

I bought the film not here, but on a local store in my country ( Portugal), but I do want to ask you the readers, especially from other countries, something that is bothering me.

In the last few months, I read that this unrated version would have 22 extra minutes of film, like unseen images, deleted scenes, etc  actually film scenes, not backstage scenes. At least that was what I understood.

However, this ""unrated"" version, at least mine, only had two more minutes, that were in the middle of the credits!! The so called alternative ending, which is only a continuation of what happens in the beginning of book 2 ( the way they are coping with the break up).

Can someone please tell me if the same happened to you? If the only ""news scenes"" are the alternative ending?",1434153600,,984,4.4748603351955305

Of the 50 possible shades of grey, this rather lame effort barely covers two of them -- as if the director were so afraid of going too far, crossing some imagined boundary, he barely let the material glance off the production -- much as Christian's flogger barely glances off Ana.  How she could be writhing in pain (ecstasy?) is anyone's guess.  Remove the explicit scenes and dialogue, and the thing has all the sophistication of a Lifetime movie.  Christian's secretive, abusive background -- what made him what he is and sculpted his desires -- is barely touched upon.

Johnson is a fresh-face, natural performer, and could be a very good actor at some point, but that point has yet to be reached.

6646238,2,B00NCDVVLY,"I don't understand all the hype.  I am no prude, but why all the publicity?  There are far better films out there!  Maybe the millennials think this is good stuff.  Maybe they have not seen Lady Chatterly - the UK version",1433980800,,221,4.317073170731708
6646239,5,B00NCDVVLY,Besides this movie missing very small details that the book had in it . This movie was great!!! and I can't wait to see the 2nd one. Fifty shades darker.,1433980800,,153,4.133333333333334
6646240,1,B00NCDVVLY,No chemistry. Just raunchy. Guess no surprise there. Dornan was easy on the eyes at least. It was confusing as well.,1433980800,,116,4.571428571428571

6646246,1,B00NCDVVLY,Book was so much better,1433980800,,23,3.8
6646247,2,B00NCDVVLY,I found the flim to be very disappointing. It did not do the books any justice.  The actors they picked did not portray the characters in true form.  I thought Dakota Johnson did not play a very good submissive. She was to snarky as the character Anna. There  was also to much tension between her and Jamie.  The scenes seem forced not natural. You could tell they were acting. You did not get lost in the scenes like you could get lost in the books. I hope the director thinks about the way the scenes play out for the next two films. The flims need to be based more on the books instead of adding  and taking out important features of the book. I loved the books. I hated the movie.,1433980800,,684,4.190839694656488

6646257,5,B00NCDVVLY,"Loved the books and loved the movie. The first time I watched it I was disappointed. I was too into seeing how much the movie was like the book. I think a lot of women loved the books because it gave them permission to be different in the bedroom.  It took away the scariness of that lifestyle. If you're looking for the same sex scenes like in the book, it doesn't happen. It would be rated X. So I gave the movie a second chance and fell in love with the love story it tells.",1433980800,,477,4.021052631578947

6646259,4,B00NCDVVLY,Good movie for the most part.  I was expecting a little more on screen chemistry between Ana and Christian.  I also think a slightly more well known cast would have helped.,1433980800,,172,4.516129032258065

6646265,3,B00NCDVVLY,I thought it was a bit more graphic than it needed to be for my taste.  The story line interesting especially how his messed up childhood really screwed him up.  Don't think I will watch the sequel.,1433980800,,198,4.324324324324325

The main problem is  there's absolutely zero chemistry between the main characters.  After 10 minutes I was completely bored with this flick.",1433980800,5,255,4.622222222222222
6646276,3,B00NCDVVLY,the movie was great. I saw the movie in a movie theater but I own  books so I have to own the movie,1433894400,,99,3.3043478260869565

6646306,4,B00NCDVVLY,I thought the two had wonderful chemistry!  Kudos to the producer in not having the two main characters be the most beautiful people in the world. This is a compliment I assure you. They were quite sexy and sensual in their own way. And my...my... my......... Mr. Dornan! I view him in a whole new light :-) He played his character phenomenally.  I never thought of BDSM in a positive way....my thoughts have changed!,1433894400,,417,4.621621621621622
6646307,1,B00NCDVVLY,"Don't give in to your curiosity, it's not worth it. Fifty Shades of Grey is poorly written, it has adequate acting, and sends a horrible message to everyone. I was bored most of the movie and horribly uncomfortable thorough the ""sex"" scenes, which consisted of the female character half heartedly enjoying being hit with objects. The movie is repetitive and in the end disturbing.",1433894400,,380,4.953125

6646352,1,B00NCDVVLY,I have read the trilogy and there are so many holes in the movie. If you have not read the books it's just porn. The character are not attractive enough too. For all the women who read the books we would have prefer to see more of Christian than Anastasia ! Really!  And the ending was very poor did not lead you to believe that the rest of the story was going to be told,1433894400,,371,3.9466666666666668

6646357,2,B00NCDVVLY,"I did not read the books because I'm a man who didn't care for it.. On the other hand, the two girls that I have dated (NOT AT THE SAME TIME) both have.. And from what they tell me, the scenes are too toned down... Not that I would want FULL HARDCORE I have ""other sites"" for that.. Just not enough for me to enjoy it BUT that's just the first complaint.. The MAIN problem is the acting it very bad, some parts are ok but overall it was bad. Not enough of a personally connection between the two, it just seemed all physical... Maybe that was intended but really almost for no reason Grey falls in-love with her and she gives it up stating she's a virgin, really??... Ohhh I know most girls lie about that sort of thing but this is not the case. Just bad directing and script. No imagination or rationalisation connecting the audience with the characters... On a good note the two actors do have a chemistry on screen which was a welcomed surprise. But the actress is too damn breathy... lol This movie overall was mehhh..",1433894400,,1022,4.328125

Between the really bad dialogue from the books, and the acting by Jamie Dornan - this was almost painful to watch.  No chemistry, no romance.  The books were trashy for sure.  The writing was terrible, but there was a story in there - amidst all of the wonky drama - of two people who shared chemistry and love.

I wouldn't turn the clock back 50 years to put myself in Ana's shoes for all the tea in China, which I'm pretty sure is worth more than all the gold in Fort Knox. It reminded me of Kim Basinger and Mickey Rourke in 9-1/2 weeks but even more nuanced.  Dakota Johnson should make more movies and explore her range.  Her looks are magnetic, just like both her parents.  If Melanie Griffith still hasn't seen the movie I think she made the right decision.  Jamie Dornan was outstanding, and played his part so believably it was chilling.  This was a very polished piece of film making.

This left out not only any of the many sexual things that they enjoyed together, moved location of where things happened around in total disregard for the book, the biggest being making a sexual dinner scene into a business meeting at a conference table in Grey's office!  It also leaves out any hint of the deep feelings that they are beginning to feel for each other.  It's stilted and shallow acting and the plot seems to jerk around going nowhere.  Stick to the books please!

The worst fall out to come from the actual books now though is that I have since read numerous books whose authors now think the color gray is actually spelled grey.

I cannot say the same for the Grey character.  He was boring and one dimensional.  I didn't feel any chemistry between the two leads.

As for the story, I can appreciate the screenwriter staying close to the book--I'm sure it's what fans expected.  However, because the movie could only be so long, they skipped some things that would have made the film more cohesive.  They tried to squeeze everything from the first book into the first movie and I'm not sure that was a good idea.

Maybe it was the script.  Maybe it was the acting.  Maybe it was a combination of the two.  Whatever it was, this movie was not as enjoyable as I had hoped.  It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it was at best a two star movie.  I can always hope the next one will be better. :)",1433721600,,914,4.369047619047619

6646583,2,B00NCDVVLY,"I was disappointed in the movie. I did not  have a chance to see the movie at the theater and I am glad I did not and saw it for much less $$'s. I love the trilogy and knew this centered on the first book which is 50 Shades so I did not expect beyond that one as the next movie my guess will deal with the 2nd book then last movie will deal with the 3rd book.  To me the book is an awesome love story that follows Christian and Ana as they discover how to love each other.  The scene in this movie does not describe any of this.  They meet, then it is off to bed.  That happens in book too but there is a discovery process in the book that is just not there for me in the movie.  This move seemed to center around GEH but the first book was about Ana preparing to graduate and the only time GEH is highlighted is during the interview for the newspaper.  They were driven around in a black Audi SUV in the movie Christian is getting into the back of a gray 4 door sedan.  On the drive back to Ana's college they describe the Audi as a Spider and the top is down, not in the movie, looked like Audi convertible and the top as up.  They do touch on his jealousy with other guys but nothing about Ethan and Christian's reaction to Ethan on graduation day was priceless.  The location in Savannah is not even close to what is described, in the book they were at hotel outdoor bar in the book they were sitting on a sofa in dark bar. Christian's apartment in the book is suppose to be white in the movie it appears dark and brown.  Elliot character looks nothing like he is described in the book, actually none of them come close to the beautiful characters as they are described.  The movie show Christian and Ana walking in on Elliot and Kate making out on the sofa, the book has Elliot meeting Christian outside the ladies apartment.  Never was a scene like this in the book and to me it was unnecessary it added absolutely no value.  The movie moved this to me to be about sex not even so much dominance just sex.  Initially Christian and Ana had sex while he wore his t-shirt the movie just jumped pass that yet.  I realize screenplay is usually different than the book but this movie did not in my opinion have the essence of the book.  I give 2 stars because the people who starred just was doing their job and could not help that they were nothing like the book characters and they we just doing lines as instructed.  That rating for me is for content.",1433721600,,2454,4.130526315789473
6646584,2,B00NCDVVLY,"Having read the entire series, you have a vision of what Christian and Anastasia look like.  I think Dakota Johnson was a great pick and she really did a nice job of portraying Anastasia.  I wish I could say the same for Jamie Dornan.  He's not bad looking.  But he is no Christian Grey.  His acting seemed really forced and at times like he was reading and acting from queues.  I forced my way through it.  They did follow the book closely and I think it was a job well done, minus Christian.  They need a bigger, stronger man.  Someone that commands authority just by his stares.  Not what looked like an bad SNL skit.  Perhaps for the next movie, they should do what they did with the Bond movies.  Swap him out!  Get a new Christian!",1433721600,,737,4.291970802919708

It's mostly innuendo and left to our imaginations.  The film itself is shot well, the actors' performances are solid with Dakota pulling off the nave yet curious ""girl next door"" very believably.  The soundtrack is excellent, and the ending is perfect.  Even the subject matter is handled very well....and makes adults who have been curious about pushing their limits into the ""non-vanilla"" areas of intimacy very intrigued.  The storyline suggests the male character has a deep-seated need for this type of activity, but truly what we see is a wounded male slowly becoming vulnerable as his seduction of Anna turns the tables and begins seducing him back towards a more emotional connection with a woman.",1433721600,,854,4.937062937062937

6646692,2,B00NCDVVLY,"Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson are good looking people, so they were visually appealing for the roles - but the movie was disappointing overall.  Jamie is a good actor - I've seen him in another BBC drama where his character is very well developed - but he is short changed in this role.  Then there's Dakota, who tries too hard to embody what the FSOG author probably intended.  Additionally, there is WAY too much left out of the movie that's in the books (I do understand why, though, since there's a lot of detail in the trilogy), so if you haven't read the books, you're at a severe disadvantage to keeping up with things.  I am interested to see what the sequels are like in 2017 and 2018, but I have a feeling they're suffer at least somewhat from the same issues.",1433635200,,772,4.415492957746479
6646693,1,B00NCDVVLY,big buildup for a stupid movie. it went nowhere and it dropped at the end. Grey was a whiny baby.

6646698,2,B00NCDVVLY,"Oh, Yeah... Here's a review to think about before watching this ""winner"", a shallow but somewhat intense-- the intensity slowly sinks into boredom-- story of lovers, a rich, psychologically damaged young man who has amassed billions somehow-- we are never told how--  just see the trappings of wealth and ""success"" at 27-- and a young, curious college virgin-- like those really exists these days-- are twisted into an S&M affair because the virgin is so naive and unaware of human sexuality and he doesn't do romance; only likes to ""F^#$* hard"", oh my! The plot is so thin as to be downright pathetically uninteresting. The screenwriter(s)? must have thought eye candy for actors and sensual cinematic surroundings would be enough to keep our interest with friends and family on the sidelines, thrill rides in gliders and helicopters enough to break the boredom, but there's little more than that, seriously, and while the acting is good, it isn't enough support the entire film which can be summed up with one line from Christian Grey himself, ""I'm fifty shades of F*$%#d up.""

I was already a big Jaime Doran fan thanks to his role in the great series The Fall, but Dakota Johnson was pretty good too.

6646733,1,B00NCDVVLY,"A syphilitic pig high on crack cocaine could have written better drivel than this. A panda with no hands, a degenerative muscle condition, and an alcohol problem could have done better acting. The acting was unbelievably bad. The portrayal of Anastasia Steele really gave Kristen Stewart a run for her money. There is no deeper thinking, no reason, no logic to the story--which is full of plot holes and ludicrous situations. No two morons could have done a worse job coming up with this joke of a movie. I would have paid better attention, but a few minutes into the movie, I discovered one of Christian's eyes was bigger than the other and I spend the rest of the movie alternately laughing and staring with horror and disgust--it was really distracting. Despite the fact that he breaks into her house, demands she get on the pill, and decides what she eats, she just keeps going back to the stalker! Ladies, if you find yourself wanting a Christian Grey for a lover, I suggest lots and lots of expensive therapy.",1433548800,12,1015,4.675977653631285

I will admit that I started reading the book when it first came out but after reading the first few chapters I put it away because I didn't think it was material that I would like but after seeing the movie I went home and started reading the book again and didn't stop until I read all three books.

There is only one previously deleted scene included and the big grab as far as this edition goes is all of the special features. They are interesting if you're the type of person who enjoys special features and featurettes.

If you are buying this edition for the unrated aspect, don't waste your money. Just buy the theatrical version and watch the ""extra"" footage on YouTube. If you are interested in special features, you'll like this version.",1433548800,2,641,4.8807339449541285

6646797,4,B00NCDVVLY,"Having read the 3 books and having seen the movie in the theater, I wanted to see it again to get a better idea of its intent.  The movie is worth seeing more than once.  It is much better than some critics would give it credit for.  While it is an out of bounds, non-mainstream, type of romance, it has many layers and depths to it.  The writing and acting are better than some reviews would lead you to believe.  It is a complex love story that perhaps many would not see at first glance.  I liked it a lot better than I had thought I would and would suggest that critics look beyond the graphic sexual nature of the story to each character's motivations and ""inner self"" discoveries.  And all should be reminded that there was no force used that was not consensual.  That is key to understanding that it is about personal revelation and making choices about how to live life on their own terms.",1433462400,,897,4.3293413173652695
6646798,1,B00NCDVVLY,"Insipid.  The male lead is too young.  Who was the most noteworthy young business mogul in Seattle?  Who runs the biggest search engine?  Is this supposed to be their dark side?  A 22 Y/O woman who is still a virgin in this day and age?  I felt very little while watching it.  They did manage to give the female lead a spark of resistance, which she doesn't have in the book.  Maybe they made a weak movie because they had a sure thing on their hands- a lot of people who liked the books would go to see what they did with it.  The buzz from viewers after they saw it was negative.  I read part of the first book then put it out on the street.  The 2nd and 3rd installments are due out in 2017 and 2018.  Those will have to be much better movies than this.",1433462400,,756,4.0

6646814,3,B00NCDVVLY,"The movie followed the book and quotes from the book. I thought the sex scenes were appropriate as they could be keeping the movie ""R"" rated. A couple important parts were left out that are important for book / movie 2. Ana's character lacked the wit and assertiveness as written in the book. Overall the movie was average. I would not bash it as some of the reviews were down right nasty. If people keep in mind this is a fictional story about DOM & SUB that becomes a love story. Anyway I kept an open mind. Some people have blinders on and only see down a straight fixated path.",1433462400,2,581,4.290909090909091
6646815,3,B00NCDVVLY,I think they did a good job of making the book into a movie.  I was wondering how they were going to do that and be able to have an R rating.  I'm not sure if it was the acting that wasn't very good or the lines that were given to the actors.  Just felt forced or something.,1433462400,,274,3.689655172413793

6646839,2,B00NCDVVLY,For a person who enjoy the book.  I have read it 10 times.  The theater version was horrible.  Didn't do justice to the book at all.  The unrated version was better as for as endings go.,1433462400,,186,4.083333333333333

6646841,1,B00NCDVVLY,"We all know the book had sex in it, but it also had a story line that also drew these to together and made some of Christians ghosts to come to the surface and he Anastasia battled them together. They made this entire movie about nothing but the sex. So basically they made Christian look like some positive dominate and Anastasia looks like some star struck lover who can't understand why she keeps coming back for more. She doesn't even have a job shows her graduation but now all they show are her gifts and sex they have absolutely no relationship even the sex is under par. They really botched this movie would have been better as a mini series. You can't put three books into and hour and half. There will be a part two they left everything very much in the air but as far as I'm concerned they gave these characters no life. So if you liked the books as I did you will not like the movie glad I only rented it.",1433462400,,917,4.215909090909091

6646852,5,B00NCDVVLY,"Heard a lot of negativity about this one, but glad I took the risk to see for myself it was well worth it. All movie adaptations have to leave out and rearange things to fit into the time frame & comply with rating guidelines. I mean do you really want to actually watch bloody tampon sex? There was also bad press about Jamie & Dakota's on screen chemistry, but I found it enthralling. As for Jamie not making a good enough Grey, I don't think anyone would have been able to live up to those expectations, but as stated before, he certainly had me enthralled!

He is great looking & has a good body, but I felt he should be meaner.  The book make you feel like there is a lot of conflict in it between the two main Characters.  In the movie, Mr. Grey seems nice.  Other than the Dominate thing.  Never the less.  If you haven't read the books, then you don't know what to expect & may like it.

6646903,3,B00NCDVVLY,"First I have to say....THANK YOU! To the screenwriters for not having Anastasia constantly saying ""Oh my!"" in this movie, that would have totally ruined it had they done that.  But I digress, having read all the books in this series I was interested in watching the movie as well.  Not for the red room scenes per say, but to see how well it would translate to the big screen.  I have to say, it could have been so much better. Not because I thought the books were ok or am necessarily trying to compare it to the books as a one on one comparison but because so much was left out that needed to be included.  I found myself having too many moments of ""did I miss something here?""  It was like the ""Cliff's notes"" of the book itself...that's it!  That's where my problem lay with it....it was rushed.  I felt like I was just watching a highlight reel.  Where's the background information on Christian so the audience has a glimpse into why he is the way he is?  That was a big part of the books, well ok, not a HUGE part of it....but it was an integral part of it.  I also just didn't feel the chemistry between these two actors...when it should have sizzled it simmered.  I may see if I can find the unedited version of this one and see if it is any better but if it's not....I probably won't bother with the following movies.",1433376000,4,1326,4.243027888446215

They are even better than I pictured from reading the 50 Shades triology seven times.  I've lost count of how many times I've watched the movie.  This is basically a wonderful love story -- especially the second and third books -- and the so-called BDSM isn't real BDSM at all.  It's just kinky sex and I think it's sad that many people will miss this beautiful love story because of their preconceived notions.

6646967,2,B00NCDVVLY,"Personally I think the movie played down the entire point if the book, which was Christian's control freak behavior in favor of playing up the sexual kinks. I think it was a decision in favor of being less controversial IMHO. Because consensual kink is far easier for a mass audience to swallow than a man who literally wants to control every aspect of your life both inside and outside the bedroom.  He took the ownership thing quite literally.

Christian was FAR less intimidating in the movie.  There were no discussions about eye contact or her calling him Mr. Grey or Sir, for instance.  Some stuff, such as the food was given a nod, but not overly emphasized. If you hadn't read the book you could have blinked and missed it and the significance.  Another example is the fact that there was no mention of the background check he ran on her and the fact that he tracked her cell phone to find her in the bar wasn't exactly clear unless you thought about that scene.

Also his obsession with her safety was played down.  In the movie he just buys her a new car, while in the book it's a big deal over the safety of her old VW and he goes so far as to order her not to drive it back to Portland (she does anyway).  It comes off looking more like an OTT gift from a rich guy (which it was) but it was much more than that.

Christian came off more as slightly stuffy, but someone who easily seemed to fall into the role of playful banter while with Anastasia.  He did do that, but it was far more significant for him.  To me, many of the best parts of the book dealt with his inner conflict between being the Dom who wants to punish her for not showing constant respect and his surprising enjoyment of her defiance and flip comments.  He was almost bi-polar on that point.  He was so turned around he didn't know whether to be mad and punish or kiss her.

Overall, there was an intensity/lack of envelope pushing missing that I blame on the screenwriter and not the actors.

I guess they wanted to avoid more controversy over the dangers of controlling men. I'm not arguing that the relationship was healthy, but I enjoyed it for the fiction it was. Although on the flip side I wouldn't want an impressionable teen (ie my niece) to read it and not because of the sex scenes.  Guess I felt a bit guilty/conflicted for enjoying it because of Christian's need to control outside of sex due to the very real issues of some of his actions being flashing neon warning signs for a potentially abusive relationship.  As a mature adult woman who very much sees the difference between real life and fantasy, I liked the book. But it did bring up the question of how responsible the entertainment industry should be in romanticizing a situation that for some could justify behavior that is worrisome in the real world.

However, all societal issues aside, I'd have enjoyed the movie more if those issues hadn't been de-emphasized.  I think they were more important to the spirit of the novel than boob shots.  I even think the movie could have been done with 0 nudity with a clever editor.",1433289600,9,3079,4.444839857651245

I have not read the book and after watching this and feeling like I wasted two hours of my life, there is no way I'm participating in any more of the Fifty Shades bizarre empire. I really don't understand why it's such a huge hit. I tried to read the book when it first came out and I found the first chapter sophomoric. This is a coming of age story I have no interest in hearing about and I'm fascinated that other people think it's so great.

6646998,5,B00NCDVVLY,"I enjoyed it. Dakota is really enjoyable as Ana and brings laughter to the film. Jamie, I don't know. There were times when I just laughed at his performance when it was meant to be taken seriously. But then again, the movie is FSOG. His performance obviously doesn't bother me too much, since I've already watched it a handful of times since it came out Mother's Day weekend. I enjoyed the books, I enjoyed the movie. It's a great escape. It's entertaining.",1433289600,,458,4.597560975609756

6647019,5,B00NCDVVLY,"I love this movie. But, this is because I love the book. If I had not read the book first the movie would be quite boring. My husband did not like it at all and felt that the storyline was lacking. I think that if you have not read the book then do not watch this movie as it will not make much sense. There was a lot of information that was left out of the movie that is important to the storyline so I will be curious to see how they do with the second part of this series.
All together, I love this movie, but again, it is because I am a huge fan of the book.",1433289600,,562,3.73109243697479

6647026,5,B00NCDVVLY,I wasn't able to watch the Blu Ray version of the extended edition and the regular DVD is the theatrical version only. I do have the extended version on Instant video and I prefer that version of the movie a lot better than the theatrical version. For those people buying this special  edition I don't recommend it if you don't have a Blu ray player to watch the extended version. I would purchase the instant video on Amazon which is a good deal and inexpensive.,1433289600,,463,4.447058823529412

6647033,5,B00NCDVVLY,"It's 50 Shades need I say more.  Don't just watch this movie once watch it numerous times.  A lot of clues throughout the story as to what will happen next.  For instance when he leaves her in her room(""Is this nice"") and gives her a peck on the cheek goodbye when clearly she wants him to stay.  She leaves him on the curb outside his office building(After negotiating the contract) and gives him the same peck on the cheek that she received when he wanted her not to leave.  Smart girl.

6647168,3,B00NCDVVLY,"I thought the movie created the necessary tension between the two characters.  What I was most disappointed by was I felt Anastasia was portrayed as wimpy in the movie.  In the book I thought she was more curious and had a desire to understand Christian, so I found myself really disliking her in the movie.  I prefer strong female characters who can be vulnerable, but I don't think the movie married the two well which is sad.  Also, the chemistry between the characters wasn't great, but the scenes were tough so I can't be too harsh in my assessment.  I also skip through some of the scenes, because I found it to be tiresome and a bit poon-like.  Again, much the book I thought the frequency of sex was unrealistic and unnecessary but I guess that makes me a bit of a prude.

6647179,2,B00NCDVVLY,Well...I was disappointed...blah...I really liked the trilogy although there were things that I disagree with. I.e. Demeaning and debasing women. kinky F$&@ery is okay...but not hurting or abusing someone.  I think those of us who read the books probably got and enjoyed what they expected from the books. Now I wish I hadn't watched the movie. Ana's character was a pretty good representation. Christians was terrible. I agree with a lot of other reviewers--the movie will only make sense if you read the books. I probably won't watch any of the other future movies for fear of being disappointed more...,1433203200,4,605,5.05

6647182,5,B00NCDVVLY,"Just like the books, there is a lot of controversy over this movie.  For myself, I thought the movie followed the book quite well.  Dakota Johnson was ideal, but I had to get used to Jamie Dornan as Christian.  Mainly because I always pictured him with dark straight hair. Regardless the pull between both actors was palatable just as the book described their attraction.  Another standout performance was  the part of Catherine Kavanough as played by Eloise Mumford.  Mumford had the vitality, spark and character that I always imagined ""Kate"" to have. Likewise Christians brother, Elliot (Luke Grimes) was the perfect counterpoint to Christian.  Marcia Gay Harden was perfect as Christian's mother. Her class always come through in her characters.

The only disappointment I had was  that the interaction between Anastasia and  Taylor (Max Martini) was left out.  That interaction  also plays a part as to the progression of the romance between Christian and Anastasia. In the book Taylor is the one person Christian trusts implicitly, which is why the progression of Christian's caring for Anastasia aligns her with Taylor.  The two of them should mesh.  Hopefully that will be picked up in the future installments.

This movie was beautifully filmed with attention to detail right on down to the red room.  The sex scenes were well done and tastefully done with the background music making them more romantic.",1433203200,8,1413,5.104803493449782

6647234,1,B00NCDVVLY,"I am not sure where to begin with this.  I am a fan of the books and have read and re-read them.  I was interested to see the movie and which position the screen writer took.  Since this book is the Mack-daddy chick lit, I wondered how it would parley into a film.  There were so many directions: how does one convince another to change for them (which could have been either character), how do the first 4 years of life lay the course for the rest of your life, what the hell is so appealing to submissive -ish and what's so great about ""getting me"".  None of these were explored.  The movie was destined to fail because it never had a clear position in the movie.  It was clips of different parts of the book without ever being explained almost like the pictorial insert in a book.  Nothing was cohesive.  You never knew how she went from having her ""situation"" rectified, to holding her hands up to be tied, to showing how bad it is.  Then it was over, thankfully.  Dakota Johnson was good.  Poor Jamie Dornan was just dreadful.
Skip this movie.  Read the books.

6647290,1,B00NCDVVLY,"The biggest problem I have with this movie isn't the acting- which wasn't great anyways - but the complete and utter emotional and yes, physical abuse, of main character Anastasia. I did read the book before watching the movie and I felt exactly the same way, but on recommendations from friends saying the movie was different, I decided to go ahead and watch it. Just to be clear, I have ZERO issues with BDSM. But Christian is a very controlling individual, way out of bounds from what is acceptable in the BDSM community. He demands her to go home rather than be out with her friends like a normal college student, gets pissed when she wants to see her mom, actually has a clause in the contract on what days she is to be with him, what doctor she is allowed to see, is so screwed up from his past that punishing her brings him joy. If you read the book, you know that there are many times where Ana states that she is scared to tell him to stop, or afraid of him if she rolls her eyes because he is going to ""punish"" her. This is NOT what BDSM promotes. This is not healthy and it is astounding that anyone would think that this is a movie showing some love story. It is far from that. I usually don't write reviews, but if this helps anyone stay away from 50 Shades or maybe rethink their perspective on this movie and see it for what it really is, I will sleep better.",1433030400,9,1374,4.228136882129277

6647295,5,B00NCDVVLY,"Amazing movie it more than lived up to the hype. I've been putting it off because of all the bad reviews I didn't want to see the books ruined but No such thing it was great and did the books justice with all the boundaries in place for the big screen. I can see where it might be confusing or jumpy for someone who hasn't read the books which is my only complaint but overall I really enjoyed it.
 Dakota Johnson was amazing as Anastasia Steele she really drew me in and embodied what I imagined Ana to be like when I read the books. I had reservations at first but she more than proved herself.
And oh my oh my Jamie Dornan as Christain Grey was a love at first casting for me I was so happy he replaced the other guy. He truly did his character justice I loved every moment from his character but the underlying vulnerability Chiristain has Dornan was able to showcase in a way that proves his talent as an actor.

6647301,1,B00NCDVVLY,This movie was awful.  Its not just because I read the books and compared it to the movie.  The acting was atrocious.  Christian Grey needed to be taller.  Anastasia Steele... shorter.  You could tell ahe wore flats the whole movie just to make him look taller.  The 2 nobody actors cast for these main parts were completely wrong for the charachters described in the book.  Also Kate is a redhead!  Not a blonde!  They didn't explain the deeper meanings.  Anastasia's inner goddess is not in the movie and that was a huge huge mistake on the director or whoever made this s*** heap of a movie.  Ok... they need to show that she likes twinings english breakfast tea when at the coffee shop and that she hates coffee.  Neither of these facts were displayed in the book.  Those are important details.  OK THIS MOVIE NEEDS NUDITY... FULL FRONTAL ON BOTH PARTS.  Otherwise they shouldn't have made the movie.  NUFF SAID.,1433030400,2,916,4.63125
6647302,4,B00NCDVVLY,I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed the movie.  I read all of the books and found myself caught up in the series. I had my own ideas who should play the leads and it wasn't Dakota Johnson. I really liked her in the movie and she really came to life as Anna. She did a great job with the role and made it believable. It is funny with all the sex scenes on cable series that there was controversy about this movie.

6647351,1,B00NCDVVLY,"About as much plot as a porno, but without the sex scenes to make it worth your time. These characters are basically stick figures - one dimensional. The protagonist is a nothing little girl, nothing to say, nothing to do, with scene after scene after scene of her trembling and trying to decide whether or not to have sex with a Billionaire.  For the most shallow audience members - the sheltered cul de sac types - this will be one of their favorite films. After all, every chick flick sizes up a man by what he owns and his social status. This movie delivers on that. Mr. Perfect who gives extravagant gifts, drives fast cars, has a penthouse, can fly his own helicopter, but doesn't know how to love, only how to tie girls up and spank them.  This is no 9 1/2 weeks. I never felt any of the chemistry between the characters, nothing was believable. The movie just plotted along. One it finally got momentum, it was over. Awkward ending.

The plot was turned to try and squeeze in too much into a short period of time. Yet. If you haven't read the book, many things won't make sense to you.
Ana & Christian have absolutely no chemistry in the film. There's no tension between them. No passion. You don't feel the connection.
The dialogue that were meant to be filled with sexual tensions and raw carnal desire seem more comical and awkward.
