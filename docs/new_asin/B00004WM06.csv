7925623,5,B00004WM06,"This 4 hour program,containing hundreds of spectacular photos of Abraham Lincoln, tells the viewer the story of our 16th president from birth until death.  The story comes alive vividly by dozens of actors narrating letters and diaries to tell the struggle of Lincoln rising from poverty and obscurity to becoming a talented and shrewd lawyer to running for president and holding the union together during civil war.

Seeing this program reminds the viewer how many times Lincoln was photographed-over 100 times.  How many photos are in the public domain of Lincoln's contemporaries like Stephen Douglas?  Maybe 6 to 8 images each.  Why was Lincoln photographed so often?
Why has this educational early 1990s documentary never been released on DVD is a mystery. So if you want to see the production, buy a VCR and purchase this stellar program for your library to enjoy and now and for years to come.",1419292800,2,900,4.973333333333334
