5675935,4,B00BUQ14O4,"I've seen a flurry of films lately that defy classification.  This is not a bad thing, either; this simply means they are so broad in scope and/or vision that they are hard to stick into a single genre.  THE RAMBLER is definitely one of those films.  Filled with vivid surrealism and near hallucinogenic themes, this film is one you must see to believe.  Part thriller, part drama, part dark-comedy, and part horror, it is an epic trip into madness and beyond.

Watching this film caused memories of years past to bubble to the surface in my brain.  Specifically, memories of watching films like David Lynch's BLUE VELVET and Oliver Stone's NATURAL BORN KILLERS.  I can see subtle influences of both directors in this one.  But whether homage or mimicry, the result is a wild yet vastly entertaining powerhouse of a film.

THE RAMBLER is shot very well, although some of the camerawork looks as if the cinematographer was tripping on acid at the time it was done.  Again, this is not a bad thing...if anything, it heightens the exotic mood of the film.  It is noteworthy to mention for those who fancy such stylized material.

The acting is top notch as well, with Dermot Mulroney leading a bizarre but talented cast.  I first saw Mulroney's work way back in the late 80s with his portrayal of Dirty Steve Stephens in YOUNG GUNS, and I have enjoyed it ever since.  Co-star Lindsay Pulsipher, who fans of TRUE BLOOD will recognize as were-panther Crystal Norris, does an excellent job as well; she portrays The Girl, a semi-real love interest The Rambler interacts with on his journeys.  The rest of the cast is great, too, a wide and varied group of individuals that help to create the insane world The Rambler inhabits.

My sole complaint about THE RAMBLER is that it offers no explanation as to what in the hell is actually going on in the film.  I really enjoyed the movie experience overall, because it is wonderfully bizarre and equally vivid...but the lack of exposition left me scratching my head at the end.  Maybe I missed some symbolism, or maybe it's meant to be open to interpretation without any cues; I'm not sure either way.  This is not a huge detraction for me, but I do feel it is worth mentioning.

Still, THE RAMBLER is a fascinating film to watch.  It's almost a step-by-step guide into madness.  It also has some amazing gore, an aspect which I was surprised to see.  I recommend giving this one a look, if anything to see just how far down the rabbit hole it might take you.  The film hits store shelves tomorrow, June 25, 2013.",1372032000,,2551,4.6177777777777775
5675936,3,B00BUQ14O4,"This sophomore feature from filmmaker Calvin Reeder solidifies his stature as a blatant David Lynch copycat. From the jarring editing and a nonsensical narrative to the surreal characters and dream-like situations, The Rambler doesn't just seem to borrow from films like Mulholland Dr. and Lost Highway as much as poorly imitate. Like The Oregonian, Reeder's first feature, The Rambler is purposefully confounding in both narrative and the unconventional yet intentionally jarring manner in which the story is presented. Even the worst of Lynch was more interesting and more coherent than this muddled misstep, but fans of experimental horror may enjoy the unsettling images and editing compiled in The Rambler. Others may find that this 99 minute film feels much, much longer.

  The basic plot of The Rambler seems impossibly simple, and perhaps this is because the feature film is actually based on a 12 minute short that Reeder completed in 2008. Dermot Mulroney stars as the nameless rambler, on his way cross country to work with his brother on a horse ranch after being released from prison early for good behavior. He makes a brief appearance back home, but after discovering the unfaithfulness of his wife and the bleakness of this existence, he makes plans to join his brother for a peaceful existence in Oregon.

  This peace is not easily found, as the rambler quickly discovers how quickly random violence occurs on the road. As he hitches rides across the country with his guitar in tow, rarely seeming to lose his hat and never parting with his sunglasses, this expressionless traveler comes across a cornucopia of quirky characters that range from harmless to homicidal. Oddly combining both of these attributes is the film's more compelling character, a mad professor played by James Cady. He has a device which is said to copy dreams onto VHS, but it has a bad habit of exploding the subject's heads instead.

  This type of shock gore occurs randomly throughout The Rambler, as it did in Reeder's debut, but I would not place in the category of horror. It seems an appreciation of horror may be necessary to enjoy this film, however, if enjoyment is indeed intended. There is a sincerity missing from Reeder's material, which makes it difficult to tell whether this film is intended to have meaning or simply meant to aggravate and infuriate the audience. Or perhaps the filmmaker has no clue what any of it means, choosing to stylistically steal from other directors without figuring out what any of it means. Honestly, I could care less either way. Sincere or not, I didn't enjoy The Rambler, but that has less to do with the gore or confounding filmmaking. By the end I was just bored. This material was better suited for 12 minutes.

  The Blu-ray is void of special features, though there are technical aspects of the filmmaking which are inarguably enhanced by high definition. You don't have to like it to appreciate the talent that went behind the nonsense.

5675937,3,B00BUQ14O4,"I enjoyed it. Mulroney was great. But perhaps this will leave some viewers cold. Strangely, I found the rougher, lower-budget, THE OREGONIAN more original and striking. This movie is literally a doppelganger plotwise to that film. What you get here is a continuous series of ""Weird America"" vignettes strung together in a hazy, grimy, brutal pall. It runs from the darkly humorous to the outright grotesque. Dermot Mulroney holds the whole film together. He is one of the most underrated actors in america. But even he couldn't transcend the David Lynch aping, which seemed much more prominent here than in Reeder's first feature. I found on a few occasions a ""weird for weird's sake"" ethos creeping into the film without having any underlying concept or logic the way David Lynch would demand of himself. So some of the dreams, repetitions and odd segues start to seem like padding than something that was well thought out. Less open minded genre fans might have qualms with the movie's equal emphasis on Road Movie, Horror Film, and Western - so if you're looking for just one genre, you might not care for it. There still was a lot to enjoy - I have to say the song Reeder wrote for Mulroney to sing at the end of the film is a GREAT song. I wanted an Mp3. And I thought Lindsay Pulsipher was quite luminous with the little dialogue and scenes she was featured in. I hope she gets more roles. There is a yucky, vomiting scene that goes on for a long, LONG, long time. I think Reeder was testing the Comedy = Tragedy + Time theory!",1419033600,,1533,4.578181818181818
5675938,2,B00BUQ14O4,"I found no point to this film, in which Dermot Mulroney participates aimlessly and impassively in scenes of real or perhaps hallucinatory gore involving physical torture, mayhem, and human distress and abuse, many replayed as flashbacks to heighten their repulsive effect.",1407369600,,272,5.658536585365853

5675941,4,B00BUQ14O4,"The Rambler is a strange and wonderful film. It begins with a solitary character who has kept himself to himself during his time in prison, when he is released he tries to return to his old life, but things quickly don't work out so heads across country to his estranged brother's ranch.

The film is all about the journey and along the way he experiences some strange encounters and some very odd characters. It has a similar vibe to Jacob's Ladder with the cowboy trying to progress with his life, but with horrible visions intruding. The people he encounters are fantastic characters, the mad scientist who has built a device that can record dreams and the taxi driver at the end stood out for me.

Everyone in the cast performs well with their roles, the lead in particular plays the solid character with an effective performance. As I've already mentioned it's a strange film, the visions blend well, although the horror does tend to the absurd style.

If you're a fan of David Lynch's work then you should check this out.",1383523200,,1027,4.662983425414365

5675946,5,B00BUQ14O4,"The Rambler is an exhilarating road film that takes many unexpected and horrifying turns throughout. It's certainly shocking and grotesque at times but Reeder infuses the narrative with disarming humor that plays nicely off the carnage. Some could even call The Rambler a comedy. I laughed a lot and then the nightmares came.

Unadventurous movie watchers beware...",1373846400,,365,5.4035087719298245
8574137,2,B00BUQ14O4,"Way too weird for me. I was never sure if these things were really happening to The Rambler, if the whole movie was a dream, or if perhaps this was his version of Hell.

8574138,3,B00BUQ14O4,"This movie definitely does a great job of establishing it's own universe; one that is equally creepy as it is absurd. It does however fall flat in quite a few areas, but manages to stay consistently strange and original throughout.",1475625600,,231,4.8
8574139,2,B00BUQ14O4,"The visuals were interesting, the story non-existent and the entire film eventually leads to nowhere leaving one to wonder why they wasted the time it took to watch it.

No point.",1475107200,,347,4.898305084745763
8574140,4,B00BUQ14O4,Strange and it kept my interest.  Similar odd scenes to a David Lynch film but they move at a much quicker pace.  Already recommended this film to friends that like weird movies that are not explained and don't have traditional endings.,1473120000,,236,4.7317073170731705

8574143,5,B00BUQ14O4,"Not your run of the mill movie.  If you are looking for some basic low budget horror film this is not it (it does have some strange blood and guts type stuff but I wouldn't say this is a horror film at all).  If you are looking for a super slick cgi multi million dollar film this is not it.  If you like small budget, unusual films that test what films could be, then you should give it a try!  It is a film that doesn't always spell everything out for you.  The plot is pretty simple really, it's about a man ""rambling"" through life and follows him through this journey.  As the plot goes on you don't really know if the rambler is alive/dead/in between/on drugs or if he is just in some strange alternate universe.  You do know that he is in a strange world and everyone including the rambler seems to take it all in stride like that's just how things are, which is what makes the movie funny at times!  I say great weird move!  Hope I can find more like this one!",1455408000,,967,4.128342245989304
