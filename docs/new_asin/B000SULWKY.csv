2891476,4,B000SULWKY,"Great series- but $229.00 for all 7 seasons is a rip-off. Get them individually, they're only like $15.99 each I believe. That's more then $100 in savings. Cheers!",1267574400,69,163,4.857142857142857
2891477,5,B000SULWKY,I use to watch Tales from the Crypt when I was younger and I am glad I purchased all seven seasons. Too bad there was only 7 seasons.,1260403200,9,133,3.7857142857142856
2891478,5,B000SULWKY,an old fan of the originals and now the made for tv. many superstars before they made it big. like in the old twilight zone. not doing a marathon. only on second season. seeing arnold appear speaking perfect english was hirlarious.,1259625600,12,231,4.658536585365853
2891479,5,B000SULWKY,"I remember watching Tales From the Crypt when I was younger, and decided to get the whole 7 seasons.  Some seasons seem a whole lot better than others but overall it is a good buy and will keep you entertained for a long time!",1248480000,8,226,4.136363636363637

2891481,5,B000SULWKY,"If I have to order a complete used series again (which I probably will do very soon) I would definitely used this same vendor.
The complete series was spanking new and was very pleased. I highly recommend any one who is thinking of buying a complete series.
I saved so much, which was great!!!
Thank you so much.",1238803200,7,312,4.396551724137931
2891482,5,B000SULWKY,"I purchased this set as a Christmas gift for my 29 year old daughter.  She was beyond thrilled.  She has already started watching this series.  She could not believe that I would think to purchase this and the whole series, too.  The service on receiving this order was great and the condition the dvd's arrived in was fantastic.  I would order from this vendor again.",1231286400,7,368,4.6
2891483,4,B000SULWKY,"Watching these shows again, I felt a wave of nostalgia. There was nothing quite like Tales from the Crypt on television in the late 80s/early 90s, and the series still manages to hold its own today. Recommended for fans of horror with a clever comedic twist.",1208649600,3,258,4.630434782608695
2891484,4,B000SULWKY,"If you're interested in the complete Tales from the Crypt show, you're already versed in what makes it good (or bad). This collection is nothing more than the individual seven boxed sets shrink-wrapped together with a new UPC. You might save some money, but other than that you're getting exactly what someone who collected the series' from the beginning has.

While I enjoy the show quite a bit, I feel somewhat cheated that I waited, and received this slapdash collection, rather than the at least boxed sets for other series (Kids in the Hall being a notable boxed set not differing much from the packages preceeding it, while Twin Peaks' new boxset is stunning).

I'd say five stars for content, four for packaging. Thanks for nothing, Warner Brothers.",1194566400,3,756,4.8984375
2891485,4,B000SULWKY,Good boxset that contains all seven seasons. Each season has its own dvd case...  like this a lot.,1515715200,,98,4.444444444444445

2891489,5,B000SULWKY,"Arrived in beautiful condition and the visual quality is excellent. I missed this show went it was on cable; but Im glad that I have it,now for my viewing pleasure.",1510790400,2,164,4.5
2891490,1,B000SULWKY,The DVD's that I received are bootlegs! The differ from what is pictured and are in very cheap plastic cases without slipcovers. I am very disapointed!,1509408000,4,151,4.846153846153846

2891499,4,B000SULWKY,"Only took a point off for not actually including the box that makes it a ""box set"". I just got the 7 seasons bundled together in a shrink wrap. Not a big complaint really, but it does make it less attractive and display ready. There is an actual box set release, so maybe that packaging was limited for whatever reason.",1503532800,2,319,4.333333333333333
2891500,5,B000SULWKY,"I am having the absolute BEST time revisiting these (some of which I'm barely watching for the very first time) and bathing in it's nostalgia. Seriously, with 90+ episodes, it's absolutely worth the cost. As I dig into these, along with the really excellent documentary about everything Tales From The Crypt located on the first disc, I breathe a heavy sigh of relief that the recent talks of a reboot never ended up happening. This is just a perfect example of the type of horror that was made at exactly the right time by the right talent. It really doesn't get any better than this.",1503014400,,585,4.580952380952381
2891501,5,B000SULWKY,Great Series gets a repackaging it's essentially just a big cardboard case with 7 DVD cases with 2 to 3 discs for each seasons in each case. I'm sure some of you got this when it was up very briefly at $19.99 which was a great price to get the set at. Other than that it's a fun Horror series. The Crypt Keeper was always a fun character.,1502841600,2,338,3.985294117647059
2891502,5,B000SULWKY,"It's a re-release of the same individual seasons as in the last Complete Series. However, the box gives it a clean and modernized update. You still get all the seasons of this great show. And it is still given perhaps the greatest investment of talent at the time from so many producers, directors, and actors in great single-episode presentations of campy horror.

While it's doubtful this series will see a Blu-Ray update, I think it's still worth owning the DVDs. The show wasn't meant to be enjoyed in high definition, just enjoyed.

If you are looking for high definition ownership of the standalone movies, however, look to the Collector's Editions of Bordello of Blood and Demon Knight.

Overall, I am thankful to own this show to its entirety and to finally enjoy the full experience for the first time in my life rather than piecemeal episodes at a time. Let it never be said that a show cannot draw you into the full experience of enjoyment with just an episode or two, for Tales from the Crypt does it well.",1502582400,6,1018,4.644444444444445

2891505,5,B000SULWKY,All I can say is if you wanted a BLU RAY then you wait for one you don't give a low rating to a release that is for something else.  Cause its still a quality show and its still a good bit of fun even if not in the format you wanted.  I say the show is five stars and am glad they finally did it right.  I hope they do a blu-ray for all the people complaining someday but really thats not a reason to put down this release.  Some people are jerks.,1497571200,6,447,3.723404255319149
2891506,5,B000SULWKY,"That old DVD set really did need an upgrade. The packaging was terrible and the discs were pressed on poor quality dvds. They scratched very easily. I think they were missing a protective coating or something. Check your copies and you'll see what I mean...

These here are freshly pressed DVDs. Definitely better quality ones than before. They are definitely thicker and definitely less prone to scratching!

Each season comes in a standard sized DVD case all of which fit into the box set. This is a lot nicer than before... it's sturdier and more visually appealing",1497484800,6,568,4.845360824742268

2891509,1,B000SULWKY,"Dang, I've been waiting years for this to be re-released on Blu-ray! ...DVD...really? Are people still buying DVDs? I'd give the show itself a 5 star rating (except for the final season). One of the greatest horror anthologies to date. Although, I'm sure fans of the show would prefer a properly re-mastered blu-ray release. For this reason alone, I give this ""product"" 1 star.",1497139200,13,377,4.90625

2891511,5,B000SULWKY,"Fun, but not scary at all. I watched these on reruns when they would come on. It's quite an expensive set for not more than you get. The first and last season suck, but all the middles are good. There were just a few shows for each season. Guess that used to be an HBO thing. It's a good collectors set, and I see that M Night is rebooting this series. If anyone can make it good, that man can!

The puppeteers are the greatest with the Crypt Keeper.",1492560000,2,450,4.056179775280899

2891519,5,B000SULWKY,"I purchased this set for my husband for his October birthday. He has always been a huge fan of horror movies and yet he didn't own any Tales from the Crypt. I would have ordered all of the seasons individually (I think it was less expensive that way) but several seasons were out of stock. Because I needed them by a certain date I went ahead and ordered the entire set. He's pretty darn happy with them. I had never seen them before and while I really don't like anything scarier than a ""B"" horror film, I really enjoy these. They're sort of like more gory, macabre versions of Twilight Zone. Oh, and they're by HBO (back in the day) so there is nudity, which I wasn't expecting. Our 7-year-old also LOVES scary movies but we both agree that he can't watch these until he's much, much, much older (like after he moves away for college).",1477440000,9,837,4.371794871794871

2891533,5,B000SULWKY,I'm enjoying sinking my teeth into these Tales again. Many episodes have held up nicely with terror and suspense. I'm sure they'll be some duds along the way but so far so good. I think having A-list producers really helped with the writing. Seeing the intro brought back memories. Never realized the show lasted 7 seasons as I remember only a handful of eps on HBO back in the day. Cool to see all the big name stars having fun with this spunky little show.,1456617600,,458,4.4

2891580,5,B000SULWKY,"Not sure why anyone would want to watch the seventh and final season. That year HBO went to England to film the series on a shoestring budget and with the exception of a couple actors (Daniel Craig) but the stories are horrible and confusing. But the first six seasons are magnificent. A killer Santa Claus, mad scientists, Timothy Dalton as a werewolf, a killer tattoo, Don Rickles as a ventriloquist with a secret, vampires, decapitations and all sorts of mayhem. Most of the stories were adapted from Shock Suspense, Tales from the Crypt, Vault of Horror and Haunt of Fear comics of the 1950s. Brad Pitt, Demi Moore, Billy Zane, Martin Sheen... name them and they were on the show. Episodes were directed by Arnold Schwarteneger, Michael J. Fox, Tom Hanks and other hollywood celebrities. If you like chilling murder stories like ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS and can stand HBO's tollerance with sex and violence and gore (no limits), you will enjoy these morbid tales with shock endings. My only complaint is the lack of extras such as showing us how the crypt keeper was accomplished and other trivial curiosities.",1361145600,,1115,4.904761904761905
2891581,1,B000SULWKY,"I chose these tapes because my husband and I use to watch them on TV years ago and enjoyed them.  When I found the series on line I got excited.  However when we got them we didn't know they were unsensored.  The fowl language and the nudity was very unneccesary.  We didn't have any of that when we watched it on TV. So I thought that was what I was getting.

I feel there can be movies made without all the garbage and still be enjoyable.

I would not recommend this item.",1357603200,5,474,4.0978260869565215

Otherwise, wait until Black Friday next year! One thing to mention that there are the double sets (seasons such as 1 and 2 together/ 3 and 4 together and so on) for about 20 bucks a piece and the 7th season alone is like 40 bucks.

2891593,5,B000SULWKY,"I used to watch Tales from the Crypt all the time... loved the mix of horror, humor and irony that the show pulled together.  This is a great collection to add to your library if you are a fan of the show.  The set is basically as shown; the individual seasons shrink wrapped together.  Probably could have packaged it in one large package and saved some resources but not a big deal.

I've had this on my wish list for a while now, but spending $150+ for it was holding me back... love the series but that was a bit much.  I was delighted when I was able to get this set as one of the deals of the day for around $80 which is a great deal in my opinion.  Amazon does a lot of repeat deals of the day on things so you maybe able to find it again for a great deal if patient and persistent.",1289347200,24,789,3.930817610062893
2891594,3,B000SULWKY,"You know, I really looked forward to getting this series on DVD. I loved it as a kid, delighting in its cleverness. Now? I really wonder what the producers were going for.

The original comic stories usually did a fine job of catching the reader off-guard with their shocker twist endings. But these TV episodes telegraph their big, ironic surprise from a mile away. Plot twists involving gender confusion and practical jokes gone horribly awry are standard tropes. The endings that I'd actually consider surprising are only so because their twist makes no sense, with characters behaving murderously or treacherously for no particular reason, and often commiting a crime no fool would expect to get away with. And an even worse problem for a supposed horror anthology, I have trouble thinking of any episodes that I'd call genuinely scary.

TftC definitely peaked at season two, when there was at least a regular attempt to raise a few goosebumps. By season three, the series descended into campy self-parody, and our host Crypt-Keeper switched from a creepy, raspy-voiced ghoul to the shrill, cosplaying punster dialed up to eleven that we're all familiar with today. I recall thinking the Crypt-Keepers puns were funny in an awful sort of way, but they're really just..awful. The same handful of words are transposed over and over again--""ghoul"", ""ghost"", ""die"", ""boo"", ""scream"", ""chop"" and a few others (too few). The gimmick cloys quickly when watching multiple episodes in succession. Another mistaken memory was of how risque the material was. It's all pretty tame stuff.

Maybe the point here really is that this series is for an audience of a certain narrow age range. Someone who's just old enough to get into an R-rated movie would find the content here to be a lot more fresh. But even they would have trouble buying into the notion that you can murder someone by feeding their tie into a paper-shredder. Even one that's industrial strength would probably jam once they hit a bit of bone, and you can just unplug'em...

In the interest of saying something unabashedly positivek, it is fun to see some talents that have gone on to bigger things, and others still who faded into relative obscurity. I enjoyed hearing the voice of Sam Kinison as a man's guilty conscience and Bill Paxton teaming with Brad Dourf as incompetent sibling hold-up men. You get to see Tom Hanks and Arnold Schwarzenegger doing some light work in the director's chair. There are some fun moments to be had here, as long as nobody's expecting anything terribly cleaver--err, I mean ""clever"".

Bottom line, my advice is to buy season two by itself. You'll get the best episodes this show had to offer.",1289174400,14,2685,4.91832229580574

8207089,5,B000SULWKY,"I remember I used watch this show on HBO when I was younger. I didn't see too many of them though as they would often come on late at night. So I was thrilled to find out that there was a complete box set with all 7 seasons and bought it. Every season comes equipped with 3 DVD's which contain every episode from that season, a neat little home menu that includes the Crypt Keeper making his usual puns and bonus features that include a documentary about EC Comics and how Tales From The Crypt came to be as well as little tid bits about each season. To me, the series is more disturbing than it is scary, but it does throw some dark humor into the mix, however, some of these episodes can get really gory. I think that the use of disturbing and psychological horror has a much better affect on someone and will tend to scare them more so than just a plain ol' jump scare would. I really love this series and everything these set has to offer. My only gripe is that the transfer for every episode is a bit grainy. If they can take films from the 80's or early 90's and make them crystal clear on a DVD or Blu-Ray, then why couldn't they do it with this series?",1524700800,,1160,4.1371681415929205

The star power here is just mind boggling, down to the directors of photography and film editors. It's very much a lark show in which masterclass directors and actors decided to have a little fun and get as naughty as they could for a half hour at a time. Tales From The Crypt prided itself on defying the conventional norms of its day, which stands to reason that it could NEVER be made in today's climate. I'm glad the reboot fell through.
