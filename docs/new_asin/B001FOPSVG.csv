8302207,1,B001FOPSVG,"IF you like fiction, this is the piece for you. B'Tselem have been ostracized for faking scenes in their photos and in this quasi-documentary. If you want facts, don't watch this. Goebbels would have approved. Arafat would have approved. How can anyone who claim to be Jewish and understand what it is like to survive Anti-Semitism create such a lie?

Yes Israel, like other countries does have issues but this is not it. It's a small country that keeps on getting illegal refugees (hello USA, Italy, Greece) and try to keep them alive unlike the hell they escaped from. Yet this fakeamentary shows the plight of a people that hate humanity and life as it is due to their own leaders and how they are raised.",1437436800,,708,4.619047619047619

8302209,1,B001FOPSVG,"What can you expect from an extremely left wing organization that has promotion of self-hate as its core agenda? What a waste of time. A great platform for Jew haters (and self hating Jews) that can lash out under the guise of humanitarian concerns. It's the new antisemitism, no less.",1341360000,,285,4.72
8302210,1,B001FOPSVG,"Although this just might be an excellent documentary, I was not able to play it in my DVD player and it is likely you cannot play it either. I have tried to play it in my two different DVD players as well as a friend's DVD player and this DVD does not play. I did not see any information about this when I purchased the DVD or I of course would have not purchased it as I am unable to find out what is on it. Be sure to check you DVD's region codes. It is likely you will not be able to play it.",1236470400,,495,3.723809523809524
