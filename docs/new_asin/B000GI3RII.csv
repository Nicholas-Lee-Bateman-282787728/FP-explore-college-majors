The Action is great, Matt is phenomenal, Chris Brewster tears it up in his SMALL performance. The Storyline isn't even that bad. what i didn't like was a personal thing, but the movies good.",1435104000,,341,4.08955223880597

If you're like me and didn't even particularly like ""Bloodfist,"" this one's not worth going after. As a matter of fact, the only real reason anyone might go after this is because it's the only solo vehicle to date of premier American Gen-Xer Matt Mullins.

The story: martial artist Alex Danko (Mullins,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mortal-Kombat-Legacy/dp/B005H7NO5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mortal Kombat: Legacy</a>) arrives in a dystopian Los Angeles to find his brother murdered following his participation in a lethal underground fight ring. Alex enters the tournament under the tutelage of trainer Slick (Joe Sabatino,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/NYPD-Blue/dp/B000EXDS0C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">NYPD Blue</a>), determined to find the killer.

Compared to the story's previous incarnations, ""Bloodfist 2050"" gains and loses points against the others tit-for-tat. The biggest shortcomings are its plot pacing and its visibly low budget. Where the latter is concerned, I'm sure all B-movie viewers have seen the general look of this film before: many of the sets are mainly made up of miscellaneous junk and you never truly believe that it's taking place in the future...or even within a real city, for that matter. Story-wise, the movie seems to forget it has a purpose for most of its middle act, then rushes its final twenty minutes to make up for wasted time. The plot and all its events and twists have hardly been altered, so veterans of the past movies will more or less known exactly how this one is going to play out as soon as all of the characters have been introduced. Speaking of characters, none of them are particularly interesting, but at least the fighters all have unique looks and (occasionally) varying fighting styles.

The fight scenes and the presence of their star is where this one sort of stands above its predecessors. Matt Mullins (who was about 25 when the movie was filmed, younger than everyone who'd played his role before him) isn't a particularly phenomenal actor but he's an undeniably standout athlete. Bridging the gap between martial artists and stuntmen, he's full of kicks and flips and tumbles and jumps - sort of a smaller version of Scott Adkins. He can't save the cumulative fight content of the movie from a barely passable rating - (of the whopping twenty-two fight scenes, I only enjoyed about five) - but he can at least make his own brawls worth watching for his sheer physical fluidity. Other notable fighters include Monsour Del Rosario (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloodfist-II/dp/6305824703/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloodfist II</a>) and stuntman Chris Brewster (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bunraku/dp/B005F96URI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bunraku</a>), who also provide fairly consistent performances.

Director Santiago would die approximately three years after the release of this, the last film he directed. It's a bit of a shame that this would be his final work as an auteur, but hey, who am I to judge? If you're a general fan of his style of moviemaking, this one will probably appeal to you, and if nothing else, I appreciate that he gave one of my favorite karate guys a platform so early in his career. Check it out if you think this is your kind of thing, but otherwise leave it.",1360022400,,4379,6.269102990033223
8132588,3,B000GI3RII,"Its a cheap low budget flick, Yes, the actors suck, Yes. But lets keep things in there proper prospective. Your watching this for the Martial Arts/fighting, and the action. The fighting was pretty good. What blows me away is, this is the 5TH different movie the same story and fighting scenes.  Bloodfist 1 with Don Wilson, Angel Fist with Cat Sassoon, Full Contact with Jerry Trimble, Dragon Fire with Dominic La Banca,and Now Bloodfist 2050 with Matt Mullins. All the same story, all the same movie almost word for word.. Its unbelievable.",1300752000,2,541,4.880434782608695
8132589,2,B000GI3RII,"Besides the extremely low production quailty of this movie, Bloodfist 2050 is an exact clone of both, ironically, the first Bloodfist and another martial arts movie, ""Dragon Fire"". Combine all of these with little exciting fighting, despite a martial artist filled tournament, and Bloodfist 2050 turns out to be an hour and 18 minute movie that still seems too long and doesn't end quick enough.

One, it's like Bloodfist.  It is the very same storyline.  A fighter is involved in pit-fighting, and is killed outside of the ring at the beginning of the film.  His brother, Alex Darko (Matt Mullins) seeks revenge and a man from the police force named Detective Marino (Joe Sabatino) offers assistance.  Matt must fight in the tournament, and studies each fighter with Marino before he fights them, just like Kwan (Jose Mari Avellana, who actually plays the fight MC in Bloodfist 2050) and Jake Ray study each fighter in the first Bloodfist.  The conclusion to who the killer is, is the exact same as Bloodfist.

Two, it's like Dragon Fire.  Matt plays ""the outsider"" in a corrupt and crummy L.A. torn future.  Pointless scene after pointless scene takes place in the nudy bar, where pointless & stupid shots of nude dancers distract us, or attempt to, from the important dialouge from the main characters.  And just like Dragon Fire, there is the similar tournament, avenging a brother's death, and the killer is the same predictable dude.

The only bright spot of the movie - Matt Mullins.  He is a refreshing face, with much fluidity in his fights and acrobatics much like Ron Hall & Marc Dacascos.  I would stand enjoying to see him again, but hopefully in some better quality productions.

As for fight action, I was hoping for a great deal with there being a tournament and all. Sadly, the tournaments were far more exciting in the first Bloodfist and Dragon Fire.  In Bloodfist 2050, each fight is very short and involves little choreography, though the fights look more realistic than the first Bloodfist, and sounds effects are ok.

Bloodfist 2050 was made in 2005 but look like it was made in 1975.  Bad picture and terrible use of a wide mix and variety of outdoor shots, from horrible digital shots that make L.A. look like a computer game, from clips borrowed from what I think was a 1990 movie titled ""The Great Los Angeles Earthquake"".  But I am sure on the budget these guys had to work with, it could be worse.  Gone are the days of at least a decent B-action american martial arts movie.  With the exception of ""The Circuit"" series, anything after the year 2000 is just rough.  Bloodfist 2050 worth watching only for Matt Mullins, or if you are desperate.",1182384000,2,2672,4.752711496746204
