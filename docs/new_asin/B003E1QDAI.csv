4112672,5,B003E1QDAI,"I cant say it enough. It is a great movie and Benjamin Bratt's performance is beyond excellent. All the reviews have said enough about the film and I will not repeat. But will recommend it, don't hesitate.",1282694400,2,205,4.5675675675675675
4112673,5,B003E1QDAI,"""La Mission"" refers to the Mission District of San Francisco, home to Che (Benjamin Bratt) and his 17 year old son Jesse (Jeremy Ray Valdez).  Che is a macho, reformed ex-convict and recovered alcoholic who raised Jesse alone, after the death of his mother when he was very young.  He works as a city bus driver, and lives for his hobby of restoring old car, turning them into ""low riders"" he takes cruising with his friends on weekend nights.

Jesse is a good boy, and a good student, planning to attend UCLA in the fall.  He is also gay, a secret he has kept from his father and extended family, and has been dating a young man from a wealthy family. When Che finds photos of the two of them together, Jesse is initially thrown out of the house, and goes to live with his uncle, who tries to get the stubborn Che to reconcile with him.  Che goes on a self-destructive binge, perhaps believing God is punishing him for his earlier misdeeds.  Ultimately, fate forces Che to examine his reactions and attitudes, remembering that family and his son were once so important to him.

An emotionally devastating film, ""La Mission"" paints a realistic portrait of the knee-jerk reactions of many lower-class Latino men to homosexuality, as well as the clash between traditional values and modern realizations. The film also features a unique musical score, ranging from Aztec folk music to some great, mellow classic R&B.  The acting is first rate, especially Bratt, young Valdez, and Erika Alexander as Lena, Che's African-American neighbor who tries to make him realize what he is risking to lose.  Absolutely a ""don't miss"" film, with 5 low-rider stars out of 5.",1281571200,2,1657,4.7456445993031355
4112674,5,B003E1QDAI,This is in my top 10 movies of the decade! Very thought-provoking movie and deeply real movie that I can't wait to see again.,1281571200,,125,4.25
4112675,5,B003E1QDAI,"Writer/director Peter Bratt had the choice in LA MISSION to make a film about the Hispanic culture in San Francisco's Mission district to create a predictable imitation of life or a sensitive study of a culture with all of its beauty and with all of its problems: gratefully he took the latter.  This is a film bursting with fantastic color from the inimitable clash of pigments used for the interiors of the homes of this culture to the fantasyland carefully restored old cars painted with religious and emotional scenes - the proud mark of the Low Riders - and the street celebrations full of lust and glamour and the intoxicating foods and dance.  But it is also an internal film dealing with such realities as alcoholism, prison time, single parenting problems, pride in a child's educational and athletic achievements - and the delicate issue of responding to the presence of same sex relationships.  It is a banquet of delights and problems that Bratt handles magnificently well.

Che Rivera (Benjamin Bratt in a role that defines his fine acting abilities) has served time in prison, is an Alcoholics Anonymous member, and since his wife's death early in their marriage is the loving father of his well-educated and well-loved son Jesse (Jeremy Ray Valdez, in a role that should mark him for an important career).  Che works hard as a bus driver, spends his free time restoring old cars to ride every Friday evening -  'slow, low riding through the streets of San Francisco's Mission neighborhood'. His family includes Rene (Jesse Borrego) and Ana (Talisa Soto) who share as much pride in Jess as Che: their only son was born with a cardiac defect that has made them more sensitive to the differences in children.  Che has only one problem: Jesse is gay and has a boyfriend Jordan (Max Rosenak) and the discovery of Jesse secret life destroys Che image of his family and of himself.  A neighbor Lena (Erika Alexander) befriends Jesse and eventually Che and Lena are draw together over a tragedy that occurs: Jesse is shot by a homophobic fellow student, forcing Che to face his own demons and begin to understand his son more fully.  The excellent way in which Bratt handles these major crossroad confrontations is written and directed and acted with such sensitivity - nothing occurs as expected and everyone maintains dignity - a very difficult range of emotions to handle.

The entire cast is excellent, the dialogue is spicy, the characters are well conceived, the particular gifts of Erika Alexander as a woman with a history of abuse who is devoting her life to working in a women's shelter who allows her physical needs to be met while maintaining her ownership of a wise woman of experience are extremely well utilized, and this film offers a platform deserving of the talent of Benjamin Bratt and Jeremy Ray Valdez.  It is a tough story told with great sensitivity and truth.  Hiro Narita's cinematography and Mark Kilian's musical score round out this very fine achievement in cinematic art.

4112676,5,B003E1QDAI,I am glad that I watched this movie on the recommendation of a friend.  A great movie with a whole lot of substance.  This movie is as real as it gets.  Benjamin Bratt did an outstanding job in playing a father who struggles with his personal demons of alcoholism and anger management as well as learning of his son's sexual preference.  This film dealt with a lot of the day by day issues facing many of us today.  An enlightening movie.  This movie will official become part of my personal collection.  A movie that I will certainly watch again.,1280966400,,547,4.4646464646464645
4112677,5,B003E1QDAI,"I avoided this movie like the plague. One day I was waiting for someone and I had to kill a couple of hours so I went across the street to my local movie theater. Being that I had already seen everything -and my personal rule against double dipping at the movie theater- I decided to give something new a chance. I am so glad I did.  ""La Mission "" was a really good movie.  It's a shame that it was so good, because I was the only person in the theater watching it.  This movie is about acceptance, it's about racial tolerance, tolerance of sexual preference, family and tradition.  The dramatic elements are moving, tear jerking and powerful.  The father son dynamic is very touching.  The point is that the father loved his son, even if he couldn't accept his son.  Wow, I could go on forever. This was truly a fantastic movie, no wonder Benjamin Bratt was pushing it so hard, everyone needs to see this.  Im glad I did. This is a movie about a gay teenager coming out to his parent.",1280102400,3,985,4.315217391304348
4112678,5,B003E1QDAI,"I was invited to a screening of this film a few months ago and really didn't know what to expect. I've been a fan of Benjamin Bratt for some time and thought he deserved an Oscar for his performance in La Mission. It's nice to watch a film that doesn't depend on CGI and special effects to tell a powerful and moving story about how life really is for so many people. Kudos to Erika Alexander for her fine acting in this film, too!",1278979200,14,431,4.142857142857143
4112679,4,B003E1QDAI,"Che Rivera (Benjamin Bratt) defines himself not merely by his ethnic and spiritual culture, but also by street culture, growing up tough and maintaining that image on a daily basis. Living in the Mission district of San Francisco, he earns the respect of his neighbors by being the very definition of masculinity: Physically strong, emotionless except for anger, able to finish a fight should one start. He's also passionate about restoring classic cars, a hobby that requires intensive manual labor. He has served time in prison, but he's now working towards reforming himself. He has quit drinking. He earns a living as a bus driver. He wants to do right by his teenage son, Jes (Jeremy Ray Valdez), who he's had to raise on his own since the death of his wife. Jes is a high school honor student who will soon graduate and head south to attend college at UCLA. Che has every reason to be proud of him.

But Jes has a secret. He's gay. He doesn't know when or how he's going to tell his father. For the time being, he assumes, he will continue making school-related excuses for staying out late. Che discovers his son's secret entirely by accident, unleashing a torrent of anger that leads to a public fistfight and Jes being kicked out of his home. His son can't possibly be gay. There is, after all, a reason God created men and women. Why would he choose to be something that's so clearly wrong? Is Che being punished for his past sins? His best friend and fellow car enthusiast recounts how he asked himself the same thing when his sickly son was hospitalized. He also tells Che that, in the end, he was just glad that his son was alive. Che eventually lets Jes move back in, although we quickly realize that he hasn't really come to terms with anything. He's merely pretending that Jes is something he isn't.

As father and son walk on eggshells around each other, Che begins a relationship with his new neighbor Lena (Erika Alexander), who's a caring and supportive staple at an abused woman's shelter. At the same time, she's headstrong and saddled with emotional baggage, the latter qualities revealing themselves as their attraction grows physical. Is it possible for her to love a man with such a terrible history? She's seen his kind before - violent men who have no healthy outlet for their anger. Is it possible for him realize that his macho reputation isn't getting him anywhere? And can she get him to see things from a different angle when it comes to his son?

One could ask these questions all day long. But you know how men like Che are. They're stubborn. They live by an unspoken but well-understood street code. And homosexuality is a concept completely outside their range of comprehension. This is perhaps a bit broad, but Bratt manages to make his character convincing, mostly in the way he navigates the emotional range; Che can be volatile, but there are also times when he's great to be around, especially when he's with his low-rider buddies. It's also interesting to watch him around Jes - the anger, the embarrassment, the denial that allows him to treat his son with some degree of respect.

We know, of course, that the problem lies not with Jes but with Che, which means he will spend the rest of the film working towards accepting his son for who he is. One of the film's more interesting approaches is that it's told from the father's perspective; it's not about the son reaching out to the father, but the father having to learn how to reach out to the son, if such a thing is even possible. It's about Che having to deal with himself before dealing with Jes. It's about coming to terms with an image that may not have much to do with the person inside. Of course, this also presents some problems, namely that it's awfully one-sided. Jes, as depicted, is so decent and likeable that he he's obviously in service of the film's message. Why couldn't he be just as flawed as his father? What if he realized he was prejudiced towards straight people?

Or what about Jes' lover, Jordan (Max Rosenak)? He's an all-around pleasant guy from an affluent and supportive family, although that's pretty much the extent to which he's developed. Is there nothing more we can learn about him? Does he not have his own insecurities or weaknesses or intolerances to sort through? I began to wonder all this late in the film, when he and Che have ... an encounter; while the intent of this scene is clear, the execution comes off as overbearing. Much like Jes, Jordan is merely a plot device, solely created as a way for the filmmakers to get a point across. This could have been a great movie had it not been so insistent on telling us something we've heard many times before. As it stands, ""La Mission"" is a good movie, lacking complexity but livened up with an engaging story and believable performances.",1278633600,3,4829,4.623543123543124

But it was the dialogues and the many unspoken incidences that made this movie great. As a straight man, I too struggled in the past with the existence of a gay close relative. In the culture that I was raised, scorn, ridicule and shunning were the prevalent modes of reaction. It is the changing cultural approach to this issue, helped enormously by sensitive yet utterly realistic movies like La Mission, that we may hope for fear and insecurity to be replaced by acceptance and love.

I'd seen him in many things over the years and he's not one of my favorite actors but he impressed me in this role. His character was witty, exciting and sexy! I also loved the interracial romance between he and the gorgeous Erika Alexander. They had amazing chemistry, but I wish we could've seen more of their romance. The actor who played the son was great as well. The character development is deep yet subtle. We see hints of the characters' pasts here and there and it helps us understand them better. For example, we see Lena (Alexander) as standoffish with Che but we learn after they make love that she has an abusive past and finds it hard to move on from the pain. This is the main reason she tries to fight her attraction to Che because he reminds her of the violence she helped herself and other women escape.

4112801,5,B003E1QDAI,Great representation of the Latin community and the deep love they have with family that sometimes is tested by the deep horror of being gay or being thought of as gay. Their religious beliefs teach them that being gay is the same category evil demons from hell and it scares them to death - that's why it's so difficult to meet or even date a Latino or Hispanic man. I know from vast experience and this movie really shows the truth about that most of all! Kudos to everyone involved,1447286400,,484,4.388888888888889
4112802,4,B003E1QDAI,"I'm a Benjamin Bratt fan, so that already gives the film three stars!! Bratt did a great job as a conflicted father who can't deal with finding out his beloved son has a secret life. The story line was a really good one that's worth telling because we rarely see themes explored such as homosexuality within the Latino community where machismo can sometimes come across as a virtue. The dialogue was a little forced when it came to the language...almost as though the filmmaker, Peter Bratt, tried too hard to be down with the homeboy culture. I thought the acting was really pretty good all the way around and was impressed by Erika Alexander in her role as a new neighbor/friend. It's not a complex film, but it tells a great story and leaves you feeling positive after it's all over.",1446336000,,786,4.581560283687943

I appreciated immensely that the movie focus so deeply into the father-son relationship, glossing merely over the gay aspect surrounding the son, and, of the father's violent ghetto nature. The  sexual scenes are portrayed with much artistry, letting the viewers' imagination to really do the work. The ending is also masterfully left to the viewer's intelligence to decipher. I do recommend this film to all parents with similar issues.

4112863,4,B003E1QDAI,"What I love about this film is that it pushes issues of homosexuality and interracial relationships and how to find acceptance in these pressing issues  and harmony in an ever evolving world.

Set in present day (2010) San Francisco's Mission District,Benjamin Bratt stars as Che a middle aged old-school chicano recovering from alcoholism, his character deals with many stereotypical cholo influences of what La Mission once was. In the 70's cholo culture thrived in these streets, neigborhood, Rat rod lowriders, tattoos of your old lady when they were still bad and deep roots of la raza and family, Che seems to be nostalgic for a world that just is no longer. Machismo, a staple in Che's  character sets an over barring tension in his world. Che's son Jesse is a teen and has the appearance of any urban latino kid of today but what soon seems to surface is that Jesse is gay. To Che Jesse's homosexuality has to be a mistake or confusion, to Che is just down right un-expectable. Che gives jesse a unfair ultimatum ""chose family or chose to be gay."" To make Che's world worst he seems to be irritated by his new neighbor a black hipster women that rides a fixie.

The film evokes a cultural mold of what it is to be a cholo in the San Francisco Mission District back then and now and challenges those boundaries with unexpected influences. The film has a fantastic oldies soundtrack and plenty of cherry rides. Che's story reins with anger, loss and above all love.",1399161600,,1471,4.667953667953668

4112880,5,B003E1QDAI,"Bottom line: this is a very good movie. The most enjoyable performances for me came from the female lead (Erica Alexander) and the actors who played the son and brother of Benjamin Bratt's lead. The son was everything a gay man dreams of in a husband - handsome, smart, sensitive, funny, loyal. Bratt's performance was solid, but he had a tendency to take some things too far - like saying ""know what I mean"" about a thousand times. All together the cast created a tight latino community that was the heart and soul of this story and could be felt throughout the movie. What I didn't completely understand was how a part of one of the most liberal cities in the country could still be so prejudiced against gays and at the same time be so integrated with the black community. It felt like a disconnect that might could've been bridged with more backstory to better explain the neighborhoods of San Francisco. But what the movie brought home in spades was the deep bond between father and son that ultimately survived in spite of everything thrown at it. This movie is about evolving to a better place and that's a great place to look toward when the credits roll.",1377648000,,1163,4.569377990430622

The whole Latino ""Machsimoism"" with sexuality specifically, heterosexual vs homosexual within our culture. It shouldn't be that way but there is some truth to it. This is a great movie to show eventually he ultimately excepts his son for who he is.

I was so disappointed that the director/writer, Bejamin Bratts brother, chose to stick with  stereotype upon stereotype with all of the characters. The story had potential to be a fresh take on an interesting premise. The dialogue felt forced and predictable. The audio was awful. I didn't care for any of the characters, as there was no attempt to go deeper with the characters. Even Bejamin Bratts performance was flat and uninteresting. Too bad, because Bejamin Bratt is an awesome actor. I kept on cringing every time a song would come on. There were way too many songs. Sometimes, no music works better than too many songs. The gay theme seemed more of an afterthought.

He's like an OG (original gangster), with heart.  And, the chemistry between he and Erika Alexander is very nice, as she sees both sides to Bratt's character, which is macho and kinda romantic.

Watching the interaction between Che and his buddies was a bit like being a fly on a wall and observing men as they are when they aren't in ""mixed company.""  The love that was evident between Che and his son was well portrayed.  His anger and the way he expressed it seemed believable although frightening. I thought the Aztec dancers were fascinating to watch. The end of the gangbanger who shot Jesse was predictable but well done.  The film was well-directed, well-acted and beautifully photographed.  Again, Benjamin Bratt shows us that he is a fine actor and, overall, has not been given enough opportunities to demonstrate that.  Thank goodness for a brother who is a gifted director!

4112916,5,B003E1QDAI,"This is set in the Mission district of San Francisco and is about Che Rivera (Benjamin Bratt - `Miss Congeniality). He is an ex con, reformed alcoholic tough guy who has spent too much time in a `twattoo' parlour. By day he drives a bus and in his spare time he hangs with his homies and builds low ride classic American autos. He is something of a character in his neighbourhood - sorry `hood' and is one of those people that does kind deeds for no apparent gain, but is as tough as nails and keeps his fighting training up, just in case.

He has brought up Jay (Jeremy Ray Valdez) - his only son after his wife died and has a very strong bond with him. Then a feisty new neighbour moves in and causes a certain amount of friction and his son decides to not accompany him on one of the low ride cruises as he has some study to do. And study he indeed does, although it is at a gay discorama of his white boyfriends tonsils with his tongue. Unfortunately some Polaroid's are taken and Che finds them. As a strong Latino macho man he finds this more than a little upsetting. What happens next is a story of how Che tries to deal with, what he sees as a hammer blow to all he believes in and how stunted some people's world view is. It can often take an apparent out-sider from the community to shine a light on the goodness that is right under peoples noses and this is brought to the fore.

Whilst this is a story based around a boy being gay this is not really a gay film, so if that is what you are looking for then this might not be for you. All of the acting is top notch and some of the camera work is truly excellent. This though is a narrative driven plot and it does so with a great deal of care and feeling. Jay also has to deal with being outed at school and the rank homophobia of some of the bottom feeders from the hood.

I really enjoyed this film from writer and director Peter Bratt who is Benjamin's brother but I am sure that did not influence why he got the gig - yeah right, well irrespective of the whiff of nepotism this is still an outstanding effort from all concerned and if a brotherly love in can come up with something this good, then let's hope they collaborate again very soon.",1344816000,,2207,4.13986013986014

4112935,4,B003E1QDAI,"""La Mission"" is a superb small film that draws the audience into the characters and situation.  Benjamin Bratt is the film's star.  He turns in an excellent performance as the macho father who has a very difficult time after learning his son is gay.  Bratt does an excellent job of teetering between extremes.  On one hand, he is a loving father; on the other, he is a low rider filled with pride and bravado.  Thrown in to the mix is his struggle with alcoholism and his romantic reawakening with his neighbor Lena.  It is a replete performance, well worth the admission price.  As Lena, Erika Alexander turns in an incredibly powerful performace.  We see her as a recovering victim, probably of domestic violence, but also as a strong woman who balances her ideals with compassion.  Jeremy Ray Valdez plays Che's son Jes.  With his mother deceased and his father who spent time in prison, he has found his way in the world, often with the help of his uncle and aunt.  He does a good job showing an intelligent young man who doesn't quite fit into his own culture.  His love interest is Jordan, played by Max Rosenack who does a nice job as the caring young man who sticks by Jes' side through thick and thin.  Talisa Soto also turns in a caring supporting performance as Jes' aunt Ana.  ""La Mission"" is a strong film, probably not perfect, but well worth seeing.

4112943,5,B003E1QDAI,"La Mission, set in the streets of San Francisco's Mission District, is easily the most powerful Latin-interest film released in years.  Peruvian leading man Benjamin Bratt's brother Peter Bratt directed the film, which focuses on the relationship between a macho bus driver and his son.

Benjamin Bratt is nothing short of brilliant as the tatted-up Che Rivera, a recovering alcoholic with a passion for lowriders, and pride for the academic achievements of his son Jesse.  Bratt channels his inner pachuco with genuine swag, in a role destined for him to play.

Che is old-school Chicano to the bone, which makes for tremendous conflict when he discovers his son's sexual orientation.  Rivera's son Jesse is played by Jeremy Ray Valdez, a young Latino with serious acting chops, and an infectious smile.  Valdez and Bratt share an incredible on-screen chemistry as father and son, and Rivera's intolerance is something many Hispanic viewers will recognize.  The stigma attached to homosexuality amongst old-school (and largely Roman-Catholic) Latinos is something almost never confronted in film.

For those of you already saying, ""I'm not going to watch this,"" calm down.  This isn't a ""gay"" movie, but it does address issues that Latinos tend to sweep under the rug.  Jesse's orientation serves as a means of revealing who his father Che really is, and uncovering the pain and rage that needed to be healed in the ex-convict.  Helping Che battle his inner demons is Lena, the earthy and extremely sexy neighbor who works for a woman's shelter.  Played by beautiful morena Erika Alexander (of Living Single fame), Lena attempts to heal the rift between father and son, while dealing with her own fears of Che.  Before the film is over, expect plenty of love, anger, and loss.

The rest of the supporting cast also make for an interesting movie.  Jesse Borrego, best remembered as the artist Cruz from Bound by Honor, is reunited on-screen with his compadre Benjamin.  Bratt's wife Talisa Soto, playing the gorgeous wife to Borrego's character, also rounds out the cast of well-known Latino actors.  One of my favorite inclusions to the cast was talented voice actor Kevin Michael Richardson, who adds plenty of great comic relief to keep the film light.

Perhaps the best aspect of this film is that it's genuine.  I've seen more than a few movies that try to work in ""Latino"" themes, only to come off as gimmicky.  LA Mission is a movie with alma, real soul.  From the clothing and music to the lowriders and pachuco swagger, La Mission gets it right.  If you're a car enthusiast, the ranflas in this movie are guaranteed to put a smile on your face.  I did think that the references to running a lowrider on biodiesel were tacky and out of place, but props to the film being shot on an environmentally-friendly movie set (one of the only ones in the Bay Area).

The verdict?  Hit up your local Redbox tonight and give this one a rent, or better yet buy the DVD online.  This is easily the best performance of Bratt's career, in an emotional flick that keeps it real with Latin audiences.",1292025600,35,3091,4.862332695984704
4112944,4,B003E1QDAI,"When you are living in a stranger Country, maybe the most important work you have to do is to trying to adapt to a spacial social condition. That means you should give up to a great part of your own ideology, or at least, making it invisible to others in order to avoid rejection. But unfortunately often, the opposite happens, dragging people through conflict. While dealing with this kind of life in Latin San Francisco,""macho man"" Che realizes his son Jesse is gay and, bursting in anger he throws him out. The story is then full of bitter moments, but also of funny and hot ones. And at the end, as if wishes could always come true, Che's love for his son succeeds, a sudden change of mind finally happens, and Che takes his car to look for Jesse to LA.",1290902400,2,757,4.375886524822695

4112950,5,B003E1QDAI,"I find this film to be fine from several viewpoints:  cinematography, writing, cultural analysis, and, of course, acting. My wife and I live in the Mission, not far from where the Riveras ""lived"" in the film. The two negative reviews on this film were written by persons who obviously do not live in the Mission. My wife is Latina, and I have organized in the Latino community since the 60's.

Who was this film written for?  It was primarily written for Latino people who are still struggling with the meaning of Machismo, intimacy, and same sex love. These are still profound issues for the Latino communities, believe it or not!  Not four weeks ago four people were shot near our home in gang violence. Two of them were precisely around this issue.  Thus the Anglos who feel this move is cliche'ed or overstated have spent little ore no time in the Mission.

This movie is about a community coming to terms with itself, with change, and with the deeper meaning of Love. Che Rivera is a living character but he is also a symbol for the whole community. The fact that he, himself, falls in love with a Black sister in the film emphasizes the attempt to deal with the wholeness and integrity of the change that the movie addresses.  The beauty of the movie preserving Lena's freedom to choose (by not tying up her choice in the last scenes) when Che comes to her finally feeling his own pain and understanding his violence is exquisite and beautifully done.

This is a fine movie. It is one of the best films about Latino culture I have seen. We are privileged to have it to enjoy again and again.",1283731200,18,1597,4.520833333333333
