6453190,5,B00KX4564S,"The History Detectives are back on the case with a whole new look but with great detections. Without the need to do a case in fifteen or twenty minutes, the special investigation takes an hour look at one specific case that has baffled people for a long time. If you are a fan of the old format u may or may not like this new version. But if you are interested in the history of a person this is the show for you. My one problem is that they did not do a proper season of shows (they only did 4 instead of 10 or 12). Other wise this is an enjoyable program to watch.",1414627200,4,566,3.9304347826086956
6453191,5,B00KX4564S,Wow!  So cool for anyone who loves history.  Mythbusters for history buffs.  Love this.  Binge worthy!,1513382400,,102,5.1875
6453192,5,B00KX4564S,"Well done investigative program, with a very strong team, and a good mix of archival probing, expert consultation, and field work. I hope that more of these shows will become available on Amazon Prime.",1512950400,,201,4.9411764705882355
6453193,5,B00KX4564S,Love this series!,1479168000,,17,5.0
6453194,5,B00KX4564S,The show is very interesting and leaves you wanting more. I love it.,1460592000,,68,4.3076923076923075
6453195,5,B00KX4564S,Great DVD on the history of this terrible accident on the Mississippi River during the Civil War period......,1459900800,,109,5.111111111111111
6453196,4,B00KX4564S,My daughter said it was a bit scary.,1459555200,,36,3.625
6453197,5,B00KX4564S,Only downside to this program series is that Amazon only has a couple of the programs on their website for streaming...........??,1454976000,,129,5.190476190476191

6453199,4,B00KX4564S,"This is a good show that has some mystery involved & is fun to follow. They will take an antique object from an owner & try & trace it's original origins. It could be a very boring show, but it is done in such a way as to be very entertaining. You will love watching it especially if you are a history buff.",1445299200,,307,3.888888888888889
6453200,4,B00KX4564S,"Love this show. It is a little drawn out, but great history and usually great ""mysterious items"". I liked the one about the Texas Servant Girl murders the best.",1434758400,,160,4.551724137931035
8662393,2,B00KX4564S,"I LOVE the idea of this show. But it falls flat. They spend far longer talking about conspiracy theories in the Glenn Miller episode than they spend investigating actual facts. They also act as though they've somehow solved a mystery. BUT, near the end of the episode we are told that the US Army reached this exact conclusion just weeks after his disappearance. I'm deeply disappointed by show the claims to show ""detectives"" when the real investigator only got to speak for a few minutes and told me everything I needed to know.",1530316800,,530,4.709677419354839
8662394,2,B00KX4564S,"Subject matter was decent, but it just comes off as tacky and sensationalized. The hosts all come off as smug, and their back and forth as bad acting. There's no charm or genuine likability there, and the over-produced quality is too distracting for me. It made it hard for me to believe any of their research or discovery was genuine because of how terribly it was being presented. Smarmy is a good word for it.",1521504000,,412,4.506666666666667
8662395,5,B00KX4564S,Learned a lot from these shows.,1518652800,,31,4.333333333333333
8662396,5,B00KX4564S,All four episodes are excellent. So interesting and well done. I hope they will be doing more like this.,1518048000,,104,4.526315789473684
8662397,1,B00KX4564S,"This is the worst acting I have ever seen. It was painful to try and watch the episode on the Servant Girl Murders. I couldn't get past the forced ""casual conversation"" at the roundtable discussion at the beginning of the episode. It got even worse as one of the ""actors"" began reading newspaper articles and showing emotion while going through them. Don't waste your time unless you like bad acting with no porn sex to go with it. Lol",1517702400,,435,4.518987341772152
8662398,1,B00KX4564S,I could only watch the first few minutes as I found the investigators extremely annoying. It is similar to a rehearsed play. I would much rather have a male narrator with a great voice as in Ken Burnes documentaries!,1515628800,,216,4.564102564102564
8662399,5,B00KX4564S,Great to see people tackling lesser known mysteries that the casual viewer likely knows little about. I think they shortchange some things and overlook questions that could be important (example-- nobody ever asked why the pilot of Glenn Miller's plane made a distress call-- they were over an Allied controlled English Channel after all). What places this above other docs of this type is their ability to cut through the Gordian knot and  admit that the simple answers could be the right ones. I wish there were more to watch.,1514851200,,528,4.866666666666666
8662400,2,B00KX4564S,"All style and no substance. You can learn more from five minutes on Google and/or even Wikipedia about Glenn Miller or Jimmy Hoffa than you can with this bloated self-absorbed bit of meta-twaddle. Hey, did I just coin a neologism?",1514505600,,230,4.775
8662401,5,B00KX4564S,"Loved this.  So sorry it is only 4 episodes.  Yes, it is not fast paced and it is scripted but these folks know what they are doing and they present the material in a very comprehensible, easy to follow manner.  They choose very interesting cases and although I loved all 4 of these, the Jimmy Hoffa episode was my personal favorite.",1513987200,,333,4.426229508196721
8662402,5,B00KX4564S,I wish there were more episodes. This is a perfect combination of mystery who-done-it and history buff stuff. Love it.,1513814400,,118,4.95
