3033644,5,B000YOX3HO,"The DVD exceeded my expectations as far as being a documentary on the life of Sonja Henie.  It portrayed
her life from her early years through the end of her life.  It showed excerpts from the many movies in which
she starred as well as her awards and Olympic medals.",1392422400,,267,4.32
3033645,5,B000YOX3HO,"I used to watch Sonja Henie's movies on TV years ago, and was fascinated with her lovely performances on ice.  I knew she was Gold Medal Olympics winner, but did not know it was 3 times in a row.  I very much enjoyed seeing clips of her performances, and at such a young age!  Her life was, as for most, varied.  It had challenges along with successes.  Anyone who ever heard of her, and anyone who likes to see the Olympic figure skating events, in my opinion, would enjoy watching this.  I'm glad I got to see this on instant video.",1375315200,4,534,4.237623762376238
3033646,4,B000YOX3HO,"Sonja Henie was an icon of grace, talent and beauty when I was growing up in the very early 40's.  This movie takes me back
to the little kid sitting in a dark movie and dreaming if ice skating too.  The movie as seen now is pure kitch.  The plot is thin.
The acting poor and the ice skating compaired to todays moves on the  ice seem repetitive and boring.  But put in context of
the time pure nostalga and fun to watch and compare how far we have come.",1372550400,,454,4.0
3033647,4,B000YOX3HO,This was a good Biography of Sonja Henie.  Good film and pictures of her life and career.  Detailed her personal life and demons.  Well done biography that is just about the right length.,1371081600,,187,4.606060606060606
3033648,5,B000YOX3HO,"Learned a lot about the lady and found the program extremely informative and enjoyable.  Recommended to all history buffs
as well as those who are skating enthusiasts.",1360627200,,167,5.185185185185185
3033649,4,B000YOX3HO,"The life of Sonja Henie is extremely interesting....the pictures from
her past, including those during WW II are especially good.
The story held many items that I had never seen or heard of before,
including clips from her movies - many of which I missed.
All in all, a very good Biography of a great ice skater and a woman
who had it all, but was controled by other people - not unusal I
guess for a STAR who becomes a star as a child.  She certainly was
the Queen of the Ice!",1208217600,19,477,4.129032258064516

8233625,3,B000YOX3HO,"Instructing the personally autographed portrait of Hitler be highly visible to protect her property while Norway was invaded, and the callous concern for her mother's jewelry immediately following her death were the choices of a grown woman, not that of a pampered child.
