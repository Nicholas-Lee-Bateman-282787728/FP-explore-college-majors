That being said, this is bottom of the barrel dreck. The costume is pathetic, the scares aren't there, and the acting is horrid (especially the ""high school girls"" - who all look like sadly aged strippers.)

A sad entry that started well 40+ years ago with ""Legend of.."" Charles Pierce has to be rolling in his grave over this.

8620605,4,B00G4FCZRQ,"This is a good follow up to the original docudrama!  I cannot say if any of the stories are based on true sightings reports or not, but either way it is enjoyable!  My only concern is they could have made ""the creature"" look a bit better, even on a very low budget. I believe  die-hard fans of the original would appreciate this work as long as they watch it with a sense of humor!  Those who enjoy bigfoot movies in general might find it interesting, as long as they are not expecting to be ""amazed"" by special effects and elaborate sets.  Enjoy!",1407024000,,547,4.323529411764706
8620606,3,B00G4FCZRQ,"I didn't know anything about this movie until I found it by accident one day on amazon. Being a huge long-time fan of the original ""Legend of Boggy Creek"", this served as a true sequel to that original (trying desperately to forget ""Return to Boggy Creek"" and ""Boggy Creek II"").

The premise was great: a movie that not only acknowledged the first film, but told of more recent Fouke monster sightings since the original release. They even stuck in the Travis Crabtree song! Most of the sightings within this film were interesting to learn about, though nothing as horrific as those depicted in the first film.

The downside is that it was very poorly done. I read one review that said they thought the filmmakers didn't take it seriously, so they had fun with it. My question is why didn't they take it seriously? I love bad movies and love to laugh at them for what they are. But this movie could have been so much more had the filmmakers taken it seriously, gotten some way better actors (the acting is HORRIBLE by the way), and made something that more closely resembled the first movie, which is a classic. I'm sure the filmmakers were having fun making this film, but when you're making a sequel to a much-loved film, you start stepping on a few toes when you start deviating from the original mold. Like the original, there are musical sequences (3 of them actually) in this movie. However unlike the Travis Crabtree song and the Listen To My Lonely Cry songs from the original, the songs in this movie serve absolutely no purpose but to serve as filler.  I had my finger planted firmly on the fast forward button at all times should another song come forth.

The original ""Legend of Boggy Creek"" was not only such a big part of my growing up experience, but served also as a favorite of the older generation, with my parents and uncles. But ""Legacy of Boggy Creek"" had fowl language that they would disapprove of, and I would even be embarrassed to show it to them, not to again mention the eye-rolling acting abilities of the cast.

The film closes with a found footage clip from a supposed attack, which looks like someone had watched ""Blair Witch"" too many times, complete with a ""I'm so scared"" sequence. Awful, I tell you, just awful.

So in rating this film, it gets big points for finally someone trying to make a worthy sequel to the original film, with recreations of more recent sightings. Good job! But it loses points for its delivery which falls short of hitting the mark, simply by not taking itself seriously.",1406505600,3,2532,4.59070796460177
