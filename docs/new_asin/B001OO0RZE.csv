3731237,3,B001OO0RZE,"This is a slick, well done series describing the border protection actions of the Canadian immigration and customs enforcement group, with a US liaison officer active in most episodes.
 A previous reviewer stated that there was no anti-US element to these shows, that is clearly incorrect as every episode, at least in season one, has an underlying theme of the big bully to the south and the sensitive and compassionate approach to things the superior Canadians take (other than their political masters who come off very poorly -- and in close cooperation with the US).
  That said, and if you can ignore the occasional anti-US diatribe, the episodes are tight, well paced with excellent acting and solid direction.  The stories are topical and the action is realistic.
I would recommend this series as both entertainment, and an education on Canadian intellectuals feelings towards the US.",1298851200,15,891,5.124137931034483

The computer geek that is allways eating is disgusting and that American agent that came directly from CSI Miami seems like she is going to start dancing the rumba at any minute.

But after the first couple of episodes, the anti-American comments really did get old.  I got frustrated.

Then there was the way the professional women had their shirts unbuttoned almost 1/2 way; in a law enforcement office setting...well, not the muslim female sergeant. I thought she was a good character, though her part did seem to be written for a character who was pretty unaccustomed to respectful behavior in the office.

It was nice to see the variety of characters on the team though.",1439596800,3,613,4.855769230769231

Perhaps because I live within a few hours of the Mexican border and am used to hearing stories about immigration agents there, I didn't identify with the characters in this series, which focuses on Canadian immigration agents dealing with crime along the border with the U.S. And the U.S. agents are generally portrayed as arrogant and thoroughly unlikeable.

3731260,5,B001OO0RZE,"The Border Series was a wonderful find for us.  We watched them in order and though some of the players may change, the quality stayed great!  The concept of there being problems at the Canadian and US Border had never really occurred to us, so we were intrigued.  It took us a show or two to fall completely in sync with the style or tone, or possibly it was just the show settling in to its own.  Whatever it was The Border grabed us and made a small part of our hearts Canadians.  We were sorry that it wasn't continued for more seasons.  Each season ends with a cliffhanger so you may want to order each consecutive season as soon as you can, because you won't want to wait to see who lives and who dies.

Interesting plots and characters to both love and hate and seeing the USA from the other side of the border made this a great investment in fun and fueled many discussions as we debated the issues.

We were able to get season one and three through Amazon (USA) and we only able to get season two from Amazon.ca (Canada).  Which is no bad thing, since it reminds us to shop for shows not listed on Amazon.",1426377600,6,1114,4.216981132075472

3731310,3,B001OO0RZE,"The Canadian drama The Border is finally available on DVD for the first time in the United States thanks to Mill Creek Entertainment releasing the complete first season on a three-disc set, which sent me a free copy of the DVD in exchange for my honest review.

The Border is a blend of NCIS and Law & Order, except the series focuses its attention on the fictional ICS (Immigration and Customs Security) agency as it protects the Canadian border from terrorist and smugglers. The agency is lead by Mike Kessler with Maggie Norton as his second-in-command, as they attempt to protect Canada from any threat.

The episodes are:

Disc One:

Pockets of Vulnerability

Gray Zone

Bodies on the Ground

Gross Deceptions

Special Features:

Cast & Crew Commentary

Behind the Scenes with the Cast

Disc Two:

Compromising Positions

Physical Assets

Family Affairs

Enemy Contact

Disc Three:

Restricted Access

Normalizing Relations

Civil Disobedience

Grave Concern

Blowback

I don't have access to Canadian television programs, so I didn't know what to expect from The Border, which plays out more like a 24 episode. The episodes are fast-paced, but can be slightly boring at times despite the fact the plots involve hunting down terrorists, tracking down hijacked planes, and stopping a money laundering scheme. Considering the ICS is a fake agency, it can feel like a bit of science-fiction than reality. They producers could at least used a real agency. Besides from Sofia Miles, I had never heard of any of the cast before, though they do a decent job with what little they have to work with. Overall, I found The Border to be moderately entertaining, and the DVD picture quality is wonderful, but I can easily see why the series only lasted three seasons.",1376870400,4,1760,4.955479452054795

The other 2 disks are fine, and I do like the series, but would like to have a complete set. Do not know if others who have purchased this set have experienced the same problem, but it is VERY frustrating to have this situation.",1361059200,,530,4.205882352941177
3731312,3,B001OO0RZE,"I am a huge fan of the BBC's MI-5 (Spooks), probably my favorite TV show ever.  I also enjoyed 24 but it did go a bit over the top toward the end.  While traveling in Canada, I saw an episode or two of the Border and really enjoyed it.  (Note, I'm not sure what season it was.)  So I decided to purchase the first season and watch it.  My wife and I just sat down and watched the first two episodes.  As for plot, acting, tension, etc., it was OK, nowhere near as good as MI-5, but still interesting.  The problem we had with it though is the camera work.  In every episode, every scene is the ""artsy"" hand-held camera mode made popular in movies like Blair Witch.  And it's not a subtle little movement of the camera -- it's a lot.  I literally had a bad headache after watching the two episodes.  We both decided we just couldn't watch anymore.  Just tonight I tried again with another episode, but I had to look away and just listen.  Sigh.  I wonder if seasons 2 and 3 had the same problem.",1359244800,,994,4.163157894736842
3731313,5,B001OO0RZE,"I'm a Brit, living in the UK and I was put onto this series by a pal ,so I have to confess I'd never heard of this show before. Unsurprising when you discover it's a Canadian production rather than from the USA.

Boy, what a find!  I ended up watching all three series over a period of two weeks. Couldn't get enough.

The show's based on the activities of the (fictitious) Canadian Immigration and Customs Service, a department responsible  for monitoring all nefarious activities taking place along the US/Canada border. This gives the writers free reign to cover everything from illegal immigration to the mafia, drug trafficking, gun running, honour killings, espionage, terrorism and a host of subjects in between. I'm trying desperately to come up with a comparison for anyone who hasn't seen it and about the only thing I can come up with is a cross between a less glamorous Spooks, Homeland and a darker, much grittier version of NCIS. But, in fact, I think it's heaps better than any of those.

Series like these do require a certain formula, so you do get the tough boss and the slightly nerdy computer guy who loves his job, but you can forgive them that thanks to the sharp plotting,  excellent acting, and the realistic, often witty, dialogue. Unlike glossier shows from the US - Burn Notice, Human Target and the truly execrable CSI Miami, to name but three - the characters are, given the parameters of the concept, entirely believable.

They're all `regular' people, too - no glam suits, no one turns up to a crime scene in a tight fitting white pant suit and so forth. There are no lantern jawed hunks or sun kissed babes. This lot can act. There are a couple of recognizable faces in the show - both American, I'm assuming for viewers south of the border - Sofia Milos and Grace Park - playing US agents, but other than those two, all the players are probably, to a Brit audience at least, new faces.

The show tackles tough subjects with many episodes inspired by real events. It even came under flack for supposedly showing US/Canadian relations in a bad light, with the US being the big bully, whose agenda is to manipulate and sometimes undermine Canadian foreign and domestic policy.

Interestingly, there's a comment on Wikipedia that states:

""Formerly secret diplomatic cables published by the whistle blower organization WikiLeaks revealed that US diplomats in Canada warned their superiors that The Border and several other popular Canadian dramas had an ""insidious"" anti-American bias.""

A good reason for watching, then, some might say.

I knew I was viewing something special when, in the episodes involving terrorism they actually knew how to pronounce Iraq - `ear-raq' rather than the dumber `eye-raq'. A refreshing change, I can tell you.

As with most series, it takes a couple of episodes before it finds its feet but when it does, it's pretty damned terrific and by the time you hit season two it's turned into one of the best TV thriller series I've seen for quite a while. When the Calabrian Mafia turn up it goes into over drive with a tremendous season two finale that is picked up again in the outstanding third and final series.

It was a real shame the show was cancelled - amazingly due to low viewing figures. In many ways I wished that I hadn't seen it and that I was coming to it for the first time.

A true gem...not to be missed by anyone who's into smart, intelligent crime shows. There aren't too many of those around.  More's the pity.

If you do like it, please post a review. It deserves no less.",1358294400,2,3551,4.683279742765273
3731314,5,B001OO0RZE,"An outstanding series and DVD exactly as ordered, looking forward to purchasing Season 2 & 3 at a later date.",1354233600,2,109,4.5
3731315,4,B001OO0RZE,"Many elements of this show are superb. The acting is above average and better than many US made dramas. The subject content is relevant and timely, especially for it's production time-frame. The action scenes are good. And the story lines are very interesting. I don't even mind the evil US depiction for two reasons:

1. It's probably accurate.
2. I don't care. We are probably the only reason they are speaking hoser up there instead of Russian.

Anyway, the only real negative thing I have to say about this show was the over emphasis they put on shaky camera scenes. The photography work was horrible. I understand what they were attempting, but it is overly distracting from the scenes and is the only reason that I will never purchase the DVDs for this series.

Other than that, personally, I welcome our new Hoser overlords.

If you don't like my review, get oat.

3731316,5,B001OO0RZE,"Over the course of the last 10-years there have been 3 superior English language programs within the genre of espionage and terrorism (foreign and domestic):

24 - USA

Spooks/MI-5 - UK

And The Border

I have already submitted reviews Seasons 2 and 3, so I won't provide a long synopsis.

The character development and evolution on The Border is superior to 24 (which is more adrenaline based) and is at worse equivocal to Spooks (which had a much longer run).

Anti-American or not?  This has a caused some debate among other reviewers and I can actually see both sides.  Yes, it seems like the Canadian Government in Ottowa (which isn't portrayed well in the show either) does ""cow-tow"" to the USA.  However, I don't personally feel that there is a prevailing anti-American tone to the series.  There is actually much more conflict with CSIS (the Canadian version of the CIA).

What you have here is a show that starts out very good and just gets better.",1336089600,8,957,4.704819277108434
3731317,5,B001OO0RZE,"The Border is a Canadian TV show about the Immigration and Customs Service who handle cases related to border enforcement in and out of Canada. Tho they are actually Law Enforcement and not 'Spys' like on MI-5, the show very much has the same 'feel' and that's a good thing. Like MI-5 this show is about a foreign security service in a foreign country this time Canadian versus the UK and so the United States is not the 'star' of the show. But the US is always looming here like a 'bigger stronger brother' just waiting to step in and take over. The show has the same fast start, smart action, cool music, like MI-5 does so you are immediately thrown in to the series. You don't get a lot of 'back story' on the Agents for ICS--that comes later--the important thing is the cases which are always complicated and filled with moral 'grey'. In the second episode a new 'super agent' from US Homeland Security (the gorgeous Sophia Milos), shows up and starts bossing around her smaller Canadian cousins with mixed results. Like MI-5, the US takes some 'jabs' in this show so don't be surprised if it sounds like were the 'bad guys' sometimes. But its really more that your getting an up close look at another Agency full of dedicated people in another Country doing their best just like our FBI or CIA or Border Patrol. And the fact is that our Country IS the 'biggest kid on the block' with the most money and resouces that dwarf our allies but that doesn't mean we necessarily do better at intelligence or protecting our citizens than they do. So US security services take some shots here--so what? Big Country, Big Target; so be it.

So WHY watch the show? Because its slick, and fast paced, and well done in its action scenes and its personal moments with the Agents. Like MI-5 which I'm comparing it too, its just really well done and compelling and they cover a lot of show in the 50 minute episodes.",1327968000,6,1903,4.484149855907781
