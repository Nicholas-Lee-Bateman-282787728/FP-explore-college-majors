3663299,5,B001K3W4VE,"I thought the film was very interesting and had some very moving parts to it emotionally. I found it to be something that others could relate to if they are considering joining a band. The idea that a band can be a big family was good and motivational. In order to be the best at something requires a commitment and sacrifice which came out in the movie. The mention of going through the whole exercise of practice for hours and days on end to attain the prize but coming up short showed the disappointment of the kids who eventually realized that the journey itself was worth the effort because of the bond that came out of the effort and the thought that ""we'll do better next year"" . Of course, anything like this can be all consumming if it isn't mixed with some diversity of lifestyle but the experience itself can be a character building experience for anyone. Having been in the band myself, I would recommend watching thsis movie and get into a band. It can be a lot of fun, too,",1358812800,2,987,4.398907103825136
3663300,5,B001K3W4VE,Good presentation of actually performing in a marching band!  Ny daughter related very well with many of the performers in the movie.  Great presentation for school agers who are curious about what performing in a band is like as well as identifying with issues school agers confront in school.  Good personal insights of the band members.,1353196800,2,339,5.017857142857143
3663301,4,B001K3W4VE,"A great education for students and parents...
on the Benefits of being in a school marching band.
Benefits are a 1 to 1 match with my own family & community experiences.

Spend the few $ more & get the DVD in place of the download.
Video Quality is better & easier to show others.",1351123200,2,280,4.185185185185185
3663302,5,B001K3W4VE,"This is an incredible movie !!  I bought it for my son who is in the marching band because I thought he would like it.  Not only did he love it, but I also loved it as well.  It helped me to understand what he is experiencing, since I was never in the marching band.  I was surprised how I got so caught up in the story being told.  It's not just a regular documentary with facts being spewed, it tells a story and I found myself laughing out loud, and even getting choked up and tears at the end.  (And I'm an ex Football guy).  This film is super-entertaining for everyone, whether you are in band or not.  2 Thumbs way up!!",1340150400,2,626,4.032520325203252
3663303,4,B001K3W4VE,"I haven't yet watched this movie, but I'm excited to. My only qualm is that the DVD holder part (where you put the CD) was broken, so it was shaking around the box. Hopefully, the DVD will still play properly. Other than that I am satisfie.",1334966400,,240,4.239130434782608

3663305,5,B001K3W4VE,"This movie was amazing.  It was great to see the work these dedicated kids do to prepare a 10 minute show.  As a band director I understand how the kids and director live and die with every performance.  Make sure you see this if you are in, have been, or thinking about getting into band.",1270944000,12,289,4.218181818181818

8314225,4,B001K3W4VE,"If you have ever been part of competitive marching band, or have a child that is one. This is a must watch. Our family became familiar with competitive marching last year. My son and our entire family completely identified and related to nearly everything that went on in this documentary.
The movie captured how Bands have many unique personalities and the various trials and tribulations that go on during a typical season.",1488758400,,425,4.916666666666667
8314226,2,B001K3W4VE,I thought this would be good to show our marching band but it is pretty dull and does not focus enough on the band but in what it means to a few of the members.,1431993600,2,160,3.6
8314227,5,B001K3W4VE,A little cheesy but brings back the emotion of being in a marching band and the fellowship and teamwork that develops as you polish the show and the anxiety of competition that comes with it.  A real good job of jogging the memories of any former or current band geek.,1420502400,,268,4.36
8314228,5,B001K3W4VE,Purchased this for our band director!  It was perfect to show our marching band before we watched the Bands of America comp. Love MARCHING BAND!!!,1418601600,,146,4.84

8314231,1,B001K3W4VE,"Its a ok documentary just to boring nd  based on the type of marching band tnat im currently in  makes all this look boring  where not jazz nore  corpral  where more like a F.a.m.u type of highschool band
we work harder  have less support nd aren't the nerdy type but actually very strong due to us having to defend our selfs  but all im saying is this movie doesnt relate 2 any band  nore any band in my area

this is more like a white army band  while mines in he other hand is mkre peppy  get down dancing ghetto band",1393113600,,520,4.0495049504950495
8314232,5,B001K3W4VE,Really a must watch - goes well with the Drumline.  I am sending it to the band playing grandson & I know he will enjoy it too!,1391472000,,127,3.7037037037037037
8314233,3,B001K3W4VE,"An entertaining and emotional look at the world of marching bands. This large band comes from Ohio and is used to winning big, but will they win the championship during the filming of this documentary?",1379376000,,201,4.771428571428571
