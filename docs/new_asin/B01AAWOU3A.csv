8746872,5,B01AAWOU3A,"The AM video has helped me progress in healing my chronic back pain, when I hit a wall with all my other practices. And it only takes 15 minutes. A friend recommended it to me ...

I have back issues: scoliosis caused by a short leg, which causes me chronic lower back pain and general tension and stiffness all over. I've done PT, which helped strengthen a lot. I also do Pilates, which has worked better than anything else to date. You can barely see the scoliosis in x-rays. But then I'd still get bouts of tension that aggravated everything.

I was complaining to my friend who popped in this video. 15 minutes later, all the kinks were worked out and I felt great.  A couple of months later, some workout didn't agree with me and my muscles were really seizing up. My usual bag of tricks - stretches, foam roller, pressure ball - were barely helping. Desperate, I remembered my friend's video, borrowed it and did the AM workout.

Just as before it worked out all the kinks. I have not been without it since.

I do the AM workout everyday, twice a day. It is very gentle, but very powerful. It opens up your range of motion where your legs and your spine meet your hips - your mobility - and works its way up your whole spine. No one had ever told me how important this area is before. And it only takes 15 minutes. If I'm really slammed, I'll do a few of the moves on my own, and that helps too.

Rodney Yee has a lot of yoga videos on Amazon streaming video. And I'm sure they are all great, and I will try others. But I hope they add this one too, then I can take it everywhere I go!  Love it!",1460851200,,1601,4.178571428571429
