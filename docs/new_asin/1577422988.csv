7799045,3,1577422988,Good tween age movie. Adults may be a bit bored but as always these family films each good moral values and doing the right thing. It is actually kind of hard to find these days.,1216339200,,178,4.114285714285714
7799046,5,1577422988,"I chanced upon this obscure New Zealand film while flipping channels on TV one day and it grabbed my attention at once.  I combed the internet until I found a copy of it to own.  It is a 'family film' about kids with cancer and predictably very dramatic, certainly not the sort of genre I'd normally enjoy.  But this movie utterly makes me weep.  It's one of the most powerful and moving films I've ever seen.  It's a heart-wrenching portrayal of incredible friendship and I have yet to see its equal.  The two young stars, Toby Fisher and Nikki Si'Ulepa, carry this film with masterful insight beyond their years.  ""The Whole of the Moon"" deserves much more acclaim and recognition than it has received.  If you have not seen this film, do--it's overwhelmingly worth it.",1131667200,3,771,4.659259259259259
