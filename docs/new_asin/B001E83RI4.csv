8297060,1,B001E83RI4,"Gary Gait is an amazing lacrosse player and coach.  I have seen Gary demonstrate his shooting skills which leave you in awe.  I had great expectations for Gary's DVD but was very disappointed. The DVD content is more elemental than what a beginning coach would even need.  Anyone who has taken the US Lacrosse Level 1 on line coaching program has learned way more than the DVD provides.

I would avoid this DVD if you have any lacrosse experience whatsoever.  Gary, please produce a coaching DVD worthy of your talent and abilities.",1325462400,,532,4.739130434782608
