6824796,5,B00PWNRZYE,"One of the best ""Basic"" BJJ video sets I've watched.  Mr. Hall really gets into the small details with this video.",1429056000,3,114,4.428571428571429
6824797,5,B00PWNRZYE,"This DVD is great. The open guard situation is really one of those positions where there is a lot of freedom of movement for both players and because there are so few limitations on movement it is hard to pin down exactly what it takes to be successful. Ryan understands the situation at a deep level and he does a great job describing the physics of the situation. He doesnt teach just techniques even though they are in the DVD. Instead, he explains the dynamics of what is occurring so that you can then properly evaluate a situation that changes as your opponent tries different passing scenarios.
The old style of just teaching techniques from different positions is flawed because it takes your opponents reactions and actions out of the equation. This DVD teaches BJJ in a more evolved way.",1426032000,7,797,4.7
6824798,5,B00PWNRZYE,Great Price. Quick Shipping. I loved the instructional. Well worth the money. I'd buy from here again.,1425600000,,102,5.0588235294117645
6824799,5,B00PWNRZYE,"Great DVD set with fantastic, clear instructions. People of any skill level can find things to work on from this DVD set, even complete beginners.",1422748800,2,146,4.88
6824800,5,B00PWNRZYE,"I am not getting paid for writing this review.
That being said, this dvd open my eyes on what my guard was lacking.
Ryans teaching skills are awesome. He breaks it down to where anyone can understand what's happening which in this case is the guard and how you need to build walls and different layers of defense.
Do your self a favor and buy it!",1462060800,,346,4.257575757575758
6824801,5,B00PWNRZYE,I loved this DVD series.  I'm only a 3 stripe white belt and I wanted to work on my guard.  This gave me some confidence and knowledge to begin playing with the open guard.,1459728000,,172,4.029411764705882
6824802,5,B00PWNRZYE,"Great series! Professor Ryan is more focused on making sure you understand the principles and fundamentals of a defensive open guard, and less on teaching you a portfolio of specific techniques. He does a great job at explaining the bio-mechanics behind each frame, and how to use frames and posture to build and maintain the structural integrity of your walls. I only wish the series was a little longer. At a few points Professor Ryan gets excited about a follow up technique that is outside of the scope of this series, and he kind of leaves you hanging, but probably for good reason -- he keeps the topics on-point and keeps you from being distracted by flashy ninja rolls and transitions that are covered in other DVDs.",1453248000,4,724,4.708661417322834
6824803,4,B00PWNRZYE,"good product, fast delivery",1451520000,,27,6.0
6824804,5,B00PWNRZYE,"thanks, Ryan Hall.  gold.",1448582400,,25,5.25
6824805,5,B00PWNRZYE,"Absolutely phenomenal. Moreso than any singular technique, Ryan provides an overarching approach and philosophy to the guard position. Anyone at any level of jiu jitsu can benefit from this DVD.",1446249600,,194,5.5
6824806,5,B00PWNRZYE,"Great instructional,  I've been training  since 2004. I have a folder completely  full of instructionals, & Ryan's  why, when, and what for have opened my eyes too much of the basics I thought  I knew.",1443052800,3,201,4.628571428571429
6824807,5,B00PWNRZYE,Beautiful and detailed instruction.,1440633600,,35,8.0
6824808,5,B00PWNRZYE,"This is a great series for anyone looking to improve their guard. Ryan goes over a lot of core concepts that, personally, I needed refinement on. Not to say that my guard improved overnight after watching the series, but I definitely have important things that I keep in mind while rolling now. I would recommend this to anyone, beginner or not, it's worth the watch. Also World Martial Arts is great. I've gotten a few of the Ryan Halls DVDs now, and WMA has been responsive and helpful when I needed something.",1435536000,3,512,4.576086956521739
6824809,5,B00PWNRZYE,"I bought this as a birthday gift for my husband and sparring partner and I can already see that it was a big mistake. His guard has just gotten that much better. I've been working on guard passing and I'm better at it, but now he's much better at re-guarding and I'm attributing that to Ryan Hall's Defensive Guard DVD. If you've never seen one of his videos, you're really missing out. He not only really understands the theory behind BJJ, but he can convey his knowledge clearly. This video gets top marks from me for its content, organization and format.  The video has high-production value - good, clear video that demonstrates the technique and good sound. The material is well-organized so It's easy to follow. In addition, the material he teaches is gold - the stuff that makes your game better. And Ryan has a good speaking voice, as well as a sufficient command of the English language to convey the material in a straight-forward and easy-to-understand manner.

I would recommend you buy this for YOURSELF but would caution you to be careful who you give it to if you're buying it as a gift. I already found my husband's guard was difficult to pass before he got this DVD because he's bigger and stronger than me, and frankly, much better at BJJ than I am. But with the new knowledge he's gained from this video, it's now damn-near impossible for me to pass his guard. When we sparred on Tuesday and I spent 5 minutes having him re-guard on me, I had to tell him, ""I see that giving YOU that DVD for your birthday was a big mistake!""  But he's thrilled with it.",1434067200,8,1572,4.489510489510489
8689564,5,B00PWNRZYE,This DVD has really given me an understanding of the guard that Ive never had before. Its a real game changer.,1531353600,,110,4.285714285714286
8689565,5,B00PWNRZYE,Very conceptual. Good stuff,1525651200,,27,6.0
8689566,5,B00PWNRZYE,This dude is awesome.  Not a bunch of moves to memorize.  Theory.  Well done bro.,1522022400,,81,4.266666666666667
8689567,5,B00PWNRZYE,I got it.,1500595200,,9,2.3333333333333335
8689568,5,B00PWNRZYE,"After watching this set multiple times, I have become an unabashed Ryan Hall fangirl. The content is primarily conceptual, and clearly and cleverly conveys the fundamental principles underlying all sound and successful guards. The manner in which these principles are conveyed also makes it super easy to recognise them in various positions and situations.

Rather than understanding this guard or that guard, I'm starting to see the fundamental principles of all guards, and my guard game has become more fluid and efficient. Can't recommend this set enough.",1494201600,2,559,5.425287356321839
8689569,5,B00PWNRZYE,"You don't have to go too far to realize that most jujitsu instructional videos are focused on a series of movements or steps that will make you better - ""do this, then do this, and then do this"". Ryan breaks that monotony by distilling things into foundational principles. He shows you that there is more to jujitsu than just a series of moves. Ryan Hall is a Gem of an instructor, get his DVDs. They'll help you train, not just your body but also your mind and your thinking!",1482969600,2,476,4.359550561797753
8689570,5,B00PWNRZYE,"Excellent dvd that provides a complete way to defend guard passes. I believe Ryan Hall DVDs are so great because he explains a whole system, rather than just show techniques.",1482710400,,174,4.833333333333333
8689571,5,B00PWNRZYE,"Great Series by Ryan hall, the way he explains the positions is very detailed helped me retain the information definitely recommend this to any BJJ player!!",1481846400,,156,5.038461538461538
8689572,5,B00PWNRZYE,"Professor Ryan Hall's videos have been applicable to my game more than any other dvd series.  Trying to learn specific moves while your off the mat is almost a waste of time, but learning fundamental movements and principles that applicable to multiple situations in guard retention and sweeps is very doable.  I watched a bunch of his DVDs while I was injured and I came back on the mats feeling better and more technical than I ever have.",1468540800,2,440,4.628205128205129
