Ignore the sheeple who give this a low rating...

It's a masterpiece, best concert DVD of the year.",1384214400,5,138,4.956521739130435

5962173,3,B00F0JG7E4,"To clear up in the beginning : I am writing about ""Deluxe boxset with DVD, Blu-ray and 2 CDs, region 2 (PAL)"". Amazon has been mixing up all the reviews for dvd, boxset, blu-ray and cd.

It was a very hard and long lasting decision : How many stars??

I have known the ""original"" concert of 1969 (two days after Brian Jones' death) and I was really upset during my London visit about the atmosphere during both concerts 44 years later. It was a lot more ""spring break"" than ""love & peace"", but perhaps I am too old for this sh... (lethal weapon).

Some of the songs were the same like 1969 (for example Satisfaction, Sympathy for the devil, Midnight rambler) but it did not have the same fascination for me like in the past. And it was not only Keith Richards, who (very) often played the guitar (much) better.

It looks a little like Fidel Castro : His speeches in 1959 (at the age of 32) during the Batista reign sounded much different than today, where he (at the age of 80plus) is still using the same phrases. 70-vears-old musicians playing the songs of 20-years-old ones are similar (Sorry Stones for that comparison).

As Bill Wyman said : ""I realized you cannot really return to something from the past after years, because it's not the same."" (Rolling Stone magazin 05/07/2013).

The Rolling Stones' music has been fantastic all over the decades  -  there is no doubt about it. Perhaps nowadays it is still better, when your mind is not oppressed by the memories of decades.

Picture quality is at least good (at a LIVE performance); sound is not worse than that. But use of camera and cut are absolutely too hectic in my opinion  -  I prefer a mostly fixed camera, which reveals the action on stage and I don't like additional ""fast cuts"" and changing distances all the time. As a spectator I also do not jump around the dome / field during the concert.

But perhaps I am also too old for this sh...

Why three stars ??

Rolling Stones music  :  *****
Atmosphere at concerts  :  **
Feeling  :  **
Picture and sound  :  ****
Cut  :  **

I can get no satisfaction with this and you make a grown man cry",1383955200,12,2110,4.404145077720207
5962174,3,B00F0JG7E4,"The track listing for the CD's here matches exactly the ""exclusive / limited release"" iTunes version from earlier this year. A decent enough performance from the Stones but nothing terribly revelatory here. The 50th anniversary victory lap is much celebrated elsewhere (the pay per view show from NJ, the broadcast from Glastonbury, etc) as well.",1383696000,10,346,5.3090909090909095
5962175,2,B00F0JG7E4,"Had potential but I watched Start Me Up and this one suffers the same fate most new concerts do nowadays- over-editing.  Maybe they think no one has any attention span anymore, but I'd prefer watching guitar solos or nonmoving camera shots and just enjoy the band and music. They waste so much money on production and end up with camera shots that never last more than a second or two, the cameras are constantly moving left and right up and down almost making me dizzy, and they jump from mile away shots to extreme close-ups. It's a shame because the picture is perfect, the sound rocks, and though the Stones are past their prime still rock out. I have to prefer the older concerts on crappy cameras because you can actually watch the band play and Mick sing for more than a second at a time. Please keep it simple next time and save the gimmicky stuff for bands that need it.",1383523200,285,879,4.425925925925926

5962179,5,B00F0JG7E4,"A great show.  I have seen the Stones since 1966 and they still have the ability to put on a great entertaining performance here in 2013.  Seeing Mick Taylor play with them again was nice too.  It's good to see them do so well in their 70's.  In fact it's amazing that Mick Jagger can jump around as much as he does.  I don't care for the 'change-the-view-every-three-seconds' editing.  But the quality of the music makes it enjoyable.  The crowd loved it too, the park was packed.",1507593600,,481,4.459770114942529

5962183,2,B00F0JG7E4,"To me, the soundtrack on this disk did not seem nearly equal the quality of the online video that linked me to the Amazon product page and which so completely convinced me to purchase this music video. The online music video seems to use close miked vocals of the performers with the audience level controlled and faded so as not to interfere with the performance whereas the DVD sound track sounded like audience located microphones recording everything together, resulting in Mick Jagger's vocals being nearly drowned out by the audience. Also stadium echos and audio compression on the DVD soundtrack reduced music dynamics and vocal clarity. Video quality and the performance by the artists is excellent, but a lot the excitement of the performance is lost do to mediocre audio.",1505260800,3,782,5.023076923076923

5962186,5,B00F0JG7E4,"I was pleasantly surprised how the Stones sounded live in a large stadium setting in Orlando in 2015, particularly the guitars, that I took a bet on this blu-ray. The massive LED screens on stage made the show a total audio-visual spectacle. This show set-list is similar and was a blast to replay this live. This sounds great on a 5.1 surround system. If you don't have external speakers and are listening on TV speakers, you'll miss so much of the experience. Ronnie Wood and Kieth Richard's guitars sound amazing.  I had no problem with the camera views switching throughout each song and love the perspectives from the distance, side of stage, behind stage, above stage, of both the band and fans.  I also thought the blu-ray video quality was great, both day and night. A great time-capsule in digital audio and 1080p video of a band that stood the test of time for 50 years, enjoy!",1500681600,,887,4.643312101910828

I even popped it on my DVD player on a few different laptops and nothing different.  Color and picture quality just blurring and nothing like what I saw on TV broadcast.

5962273,5,B00F0JG7E4,"Don't let the unfortunately accurate complaints about the horrible video editing deter you - this amazing performance and the vitality of both the songs and the performers after fifty years will captivate you in spite of it.  This is genuine, in the moment, rock n' roll by guys who are amazingly doing it like 20 year olds when they are in fact all around 70.  Keep that number in mind as you watch Mick's unbelievable energy.  It is also a marvelous showcase for Charlie Watts steady artistry at the drum kit.  As far as the video goes - it does get less intrusive in the second half.  It appears that what they were trying to do was match the tempo of the visual cuts with the tempo of the music. Editing, after all, is what establishes the rhythm of a film.  However, they should have realized after watching the first song they cut that way that it doesn't work - otherwise every concert video would be cut that way.  The audience wants to focus on the musical performance - not be distracted by incessant cutting that tries to keep pace with it.  And what is the laughable fixation with continual and meaningless overhead shots of the stage on which you can make out nothing?

5962277,5,B00F0JG7E4,"This is a terrific concert! Other reviewers have commented on the jumpiness and fast cut cinematography but I really didn't find it so terribly distracting. Yes, there are some shots of individuals from the audience that appear to have been filmed prior to the concert that seem, sometimes, to last a bit long, but it's not like that went on forever. It certainly showed how diverse a crowd, agewise, it was.
The whole band was tight and cooking. Keef sounded better, and more on key, than he has in years. Mick was rocking, as was Ronnie and the old Wembley Whammer. Nice to see Bobby Keys, Tim Riese, Lisa Fischer, Bernard Fowler and even Chuck Leavell still so professional and putting on a great show.
I've been a fan since 1963 and I even have a Telecaster in my guitar collection tuned to open G I use when playing the Stones' hits catalogue;  I know what Keef and Ronnie are playing but I still like to watch them do it. That said, I understand why the camera seeks out Mick, one of the greatest showman of this and every other era. He's still got it folks and this BluRay disc gives you the concert and the sound you want to revel in the music of the greatest rock and roll band in the world.

Mostly, he just walks around strumming a cord about every 5 seconds, actually strikes more poses than plays.

This is a legendary band that can no longer play their own songs. Were it it not for the other back up musicians, and the ""ghost drumming"" quite evident in most songs, this performance would play like a flat out SNL parody.",1409443200,,559,4.470588235294118

Kieth Richards, he is the definition of a Rock and Roller, from the way he dresses too the hip jewelry that is perfect. He is just cool. (haha) I am sorry but, Charlie Watts with the straight face can out play any drummer in the world. I just can't imagine being his age and hitting a set of drums for 90 some odd minutes without collapsing. Ron Wood, the guy is a ledgand, I mean he has played with the best but, he plays the best when he is with his mates. I just could not beleive how perfect each song sounded, Jagger's voice like I said, has not changed, by my ears anyways. All I can say is, this band as been around 50 years, there is no band that has come out in the last twenty years that will be around as long as The Rolling Stones have.

After watching the entire concert, I don't think this editing is as terrible as some people have stated, and I really enjoyed it very much. The image and audio quality are incredible, you get to hear some of the best Stones songs, plus ""Doom and Gloom"" which fits in well. The band really seem to be enjoying the concert, and you get to see/hear Mick Taylor doing what he does best in ""Midnight Rambler"".

Even though there are many more awesome Stones concert releases (""Ladies & Gentlemen"", "" Some Girls - Live in Texas '78"", ""Shine a Light""), if you are a Stones fan you should definitely get this on blu-ray, you won't regret it.

Instead of letting us watch the concert, they show us, and remind us, and never let us forget, that they are in control of what we see. No single shot lasts more than three seconds. Not once can we watch Keith or Ronnie play an entire lick. The longest shots are the ones where the camera zooms in from the back of the crowd, over their heads, and focuses on someone on the stage for about a half a second and then cuts to something else. This particular shot is repeated over and over and over throughout the show to the point of tedium.  A close second in frequency is the shot of people in the audience sticking their fingers in the air. Ridiculous!  You can see much better film of the band for free online.

5962337,5,B00F0JG7E4,"Like other reviewers here, I also hate quick cuts that don't give you a chance to focus on a shot before quickly jumping to the next shot...but this is NOT one of those concerts! The length of time each shot remains onscreen feels very comfortable and unrushed. The Stones have been making concert videos longer than anyone, and they are consummate professionals. This is one of the best concert videos you will ever see. The lighting, the camera angles, the composition of each and every shot is superb! It sounds terrific too. Also, concert videos NEED crowd shots. They contribute to the ""you are there"" feeling...seeing the reaction shots of the fans is vital to any good concert video. Don't worry, there's plenty of the band. The crowd shots are lightly peppered throughout the concert and do not detract from it at all (they enhance it). I'm not even a big Stones fan, but I certainly recognize a great concert video when I see one. I'd guess that most of the people complaining about quick shots and over-editing are over 60 (and if not, they're acting like they are). Remember, Mick Jagger had final approval, and he's 70. Why don't you go back outside and say ""Hey you kids, get off of my lawn!""",1390780800,,1205,4.635514018691588

5962346,4,B00F0JG7E4,"There's not much left to be said about The Rolling Stones, and this 2013 concert recorded at the legendary Hyde Park (where they gave a legendary show in 1969) certainly adds nothing to their immense legacy. With that said, rock's most beloved elder statesmen still play with remarkable energy and Jagger still has yet to be reminded 70, pushing the limits of age as far as he can with his incessant running around and strong vocals.

There's nothing new on ""Sweet Summer Sun"" that the average fan has not already heard; live versions of their 1980 hit ""Emotional Rescue"" and their new 2012 recording ""Doom and Gloom"" are the only real eye grabbing inclusions. However, while offering nothing new, this is still an interesting look at where the band is at in their 50th year, and it's always good to hear how certain songs have evolved over the years and how many of them remarkably maintain their edge over the years. Some of these tracks just don't carry the same punch coming from 70 year old men as they did from 25 year old men, with ""Street Fighting Man"" and ""Jumping Jack Flash"" sounding especially feeble. But ""Pain It, Black"" still drips with fury, and ""Brown Sugar"" is still one of the great party-rock anthems. The best songs are the ballads, with ""Ruby Tuesday"" and ""You Can't Always Get What You Want"" sounding particularly excellent. Keith's ""You Got the Silver"" is also one of the high points.

The audio on both the cd and dvd is excellent, though the dvd suffers from very shoddy film work. While far from the greatest Stones release, ""Sweet Summer Sun"" is still more than listenable.",1390089600,,1601,4.693950177935943

Having said that, this blu-ray proves once again that, even at their age, The Rolling Stones can out-rock any other band in the world. Bar none. This concert is a joy to watch. I have only one critical comment. For some unknown reason, Keith doesn't sing a single song. I missed hearing Happy or Little T&A. On the other hand, they feature former band member Mick Taylor on a blistering performance of Midnight Rambler that must be seen and heard to be believed. If you are a real rock & roll fan, this concert is a must addition to your collection. It just doesn't get any better than Sweet Summer Sun.",1389830400,,709,4.298507462686567

Overall though, the Stones are still the world's greatest rock n roll band and prove it on this DVD. I highly recommend it.",1389830400,,418,4.5131578947368425

Lisa Fisher is her usually spectacular self and Mick didn't hesitate to let her take center stage--age has wisely  impacted the size of his ego. After following the Stones through the Exile tour it was so special to have Mick Taylor's presence again.  Incredibly touching to see the butterflies during ""Miss You"" dedicated to Brian. The juxtapositioning of old footage with the new was ""brilliant"" as the Brits love to say. Every die hard Stones fan should own this as part of the band's history.

5962359,5,B00F0JG7E4,"I've been skeptical of recent Stones.  But wow, the 'Sweet Summer Sun' DVD of them at Hyde Park this past summer is great.  They played really, really well.  If anything, they knew they had to rise to the occasion, and they did.

My DVD player broke, so I've been watching it on my laptop, with headphones.  Because of that, I've been able to pay close attention to Keith's guitar in my right ear, and Ronnie's in my left.  Their interplay is terrific, but the really encouraging thing is that Keith is dead-on in his playing.  He plays more laid-back now tan 20 or 30 years ago, but he is damn solid again.  What a relief to have him back.

The film itself is excellent.  It's not just a concert.  There is pre-show footage, some interview snippets.  And then there are crowd scenes and footage of the day's event.  Really colorful and fun to watch.

I've never been a big fan of ""Street Fighting Man.""  But I have to say that the end/run-out jam on that song is damn good-- really gives you a sense of how the modern day Stones sound when they're in their groove.

All in all, this is a better concert and better document than 2006's 'Shine A Light.'  It's nice to know that there is a more recent, live record of the Stones-- and one that can replace 'Shine A Light,' since that concert isn't as enjoyable (Keith is sloppy, Mick is not in great voice.)  Whenever it is that we finally lose the Stones, at least there's a recent film of them that kicks ass.

Keith sings two songs, by the way, and seems to be in stronger voice than in years past.  Plus, he moves around the stage a bit and must be in decent health.  I have a feeling that Mick really put it to him before they toured, saying, ""You better hack it.""  You get the sense that Keith is doing his best, knowing he has to come through, no coasting.

Ronnie must be sober and in good health because he just rips on guitar when needed.  And Darryl Jones is being given more of a spotlight at times, which he deserves.  (I love that Darryl plays 4-string bass-- none of that pretentious 5- and 6- string bass pomposity.)  And Charlie remains a phenomenon-- perfect, rock-steady beats, song after song.

If you like the Stones, buy this.",1388966400,4,2196,4.3580246913580245

5962362,2,B00F0JG7E4,"Great performance, sound and picture, but probably my least favorite Stones concert DVD/Blu-Ray.  As others have complained, the quick cuts are annoying and not only does the audience get way too much screen time, many of these shots are very cheesy, quite obviously staged and out of sync with the music.  For instance, the stills of isolated fans staring into the camera during ""Ruby Tuesday"" was uncomfortable to watch and frankly made this great song's sentimentality kind of laughable.

I don't know why the director was trying to re-invent the wheel with this one.  He should have taken a lesson from the greatest director of our time, Martin Scorsese, who wisely focused almost entirely on the band in his concert film ""Shine A Light"".  With this band, the performance should (and invariably does) speak for itself.

Lastly, as someone who buys every live album or video the Stones put out, I would have liked to see a more imaginative tracklists.  I already have dozens of versions of most of these songs because they put them on every single release.  Satisfaction, Start Me Up, Brown Sugar, Miss You, Sympathy, HTW, Happy...All good songs, but how about mixing it up for once?  Why cut the 3 or 4 songs that would have made this recording unique from past releases?

For any fans out there, I'd recommend seeking out the recording of the Glastonbury show from a few days prior.  Not only a great performance w/ good sound, but also a great, unique setlist and a straightforward focus on the band.",1388707200,,1506,4.7984496124031

The Holy Trinity of Mick, Keith and Charlie (the founders) were FULL OF ENERGY for this Return to Hyde Park concert; so was Mick Taylor who played a number in memory of his first occasion with the Stones, it's too bad Bill wasn't there as well.  The collection includes the '69 performance which I had never seen and am so happy to have finally experienced an event that to me was more mythical than real all these years.  The extras are wonderful, and if only I had a blue-ray I'd be able to experience the total benefit of this collection.  If you are a mature Stones fan, as I am, or a novice, this is truly a worthwhile and worth it collection to own.  I was amazed at how well the boys played..., and, of course, Ronnie Wood!

5962365,5,B00F0JG7E4,"Got this during Amazon's daily holiday deals at a great price. The discs come in a hardcover book of photographs of the Hyde Park shows in 1969 and 2013. The discs include DVD, Blu-Ray and CD versions of the 2013 show, and a DVD of the Hyde Park 1969 show, also known as Stones In The Park. The discs are stored in slots within the inside front and back covers, and they are a little difficult to get out. I feel like I'm going to break the discs trying to get them out.

The Hyde Park 2013 show has taken some criticism for the quick-cut MTV style editing. This is more obvious when comparing to the 1969 show. I have seen worse, and from this band (the Live Licks box is literally unwatchable). There are moments that linger, maybe a few seconds more than usual, but I really, really hate this style of editing and I wish it would just stop. Martin Scorcese knows how to film a concert - the Stones' own Shine A Light is a good example, as well as The Band's The Last Waltz. The idiot who edited this needs to take some lessons from the master. But, I can't say this is unwatchable, and the band really hits the mark. Another interesting comparison can be made to the 1969 show, which is sloppy. (Mick Taylor had joined the band literally weeks prior to the show.)

The CDs are merely the soundtrack to the DVDs, mixed well, and the power and heart of the band come through in the audio as well as the video. This band knows its days are numbered, and they are playing with all the strength and talent they can muster. They are not just going through the motions and cashing the check (as they have been rightly accused of in the past). They are playing for the ages. It's a privilege to watch them.",1388620800,8,1701,4.2631578947368425
5962366,3,B00F0JG7E4,"Sometimes, it's better to let it rest. This concert is a case in point, as it proves that you cannot always go home again. On this presentation, The Stones come dangerously, perilously close to ""an oldies band"" incarnation. Yes, Mick Jagger is energetic, Charlie Watts is on his game (as always), but Ronnie Wood shows why The Stones as a band have never been able to move beyond it's 1970's heydays and Keith Richards is looking like his batteries are almost wore out. All the hits are here, nothing really new and, if such a thing is possible, this concert is one big bore. I was barely able to get through the first viewing without nodding off. I love The Rolling Stones. I have been a fan since Day One, since their first appearances on American television (The Mike Douglas Show, The Hollywood Palace) and have followed them faithfully ever since, eagerly buying every single and album and proudly plopping down an ever-increasing amount of dollars to see them in concert on nearly every tour they done in the U.S. But, as I watched this concert in Hyde Park--a revisiting of one of their most memorable and important concerts, given in the summer of 1969--I became acutely aware of the subtle details that make this newer concert a very pale imitation of the former. For example, it is quite sad to see Mick performing ""Midnight Rambler"" out of context in that he no longer doffs his belt and falls to the stage, slamming the belt down in an S/M fury as he did in 1969 and several years after. The same for the subtle changes in some verses of popular songs. After all, The Stones are now a FAMILY event and you can't have Mick singing about ""cocaine eyes"" or ""speed-freak jive"", ya know? Even the crowd looks desultory, as if they, too, simply want to pretend that they are reliving a momentous event in the life of The Stones. The drama of the first Hyde Park Concert is not in evidence here. This is just a paean to the fans, because, well, after all, it WAS The Stones 50th anniversary as a band and all. Even bringing on a sadly overweight Mick Taylor (still an amazing guitar player) and a disgruntled Bill Wyman for a few numbers doesn't take away the pain of realization that we ALL have gotten older and perhaps, just perhaps, it is time for Mick and The Boys to go gently into that good night. You've done it well, mates. But all good things must come to an end. And this may be just what we need.",1388534400,3,2413,4.461538461538462

5962369,5,B00F0JG7E4,"Still one of the top two or three acts in the world 50+ years into their career ... the Stones were hitting on all cylinders at Hyde Park ... they seemed to really be into it, and having a great time ... everyone was animated & enthusiastic ... different members sharing the mikes when singing back-up vocals ... smiling, laughing, and giving the crowd everything they had in their performing arsenal !!! Even the ""supporting"" musicians & singers were in top form ... and contributed a lot to this superb show ... especially Chuck Leavell, Lisa Fischer, and Bobby Keys ...

This band certainly is a freak of nature ... being able to sustain such a high level of performance at their respective ages ranging from 67 to 72 ... while they have not released a really good album since ""Steel Wheels"" in '89,  they take songs from their immense catalog, and make them shine ""live"" ... and do what the Stones have always done better than anyone ...  play rough around the edges, snotty rock & roll with a large amount of attitude !!

The highlight for me was Mick Taylor's playing on ""Midnight Rambler"" ... and I felt a warm tinge of nostalgia when Mick, Keith, Ronnie, & Charlie included him in the show closing bows ...  why this guy ever left the band I'll never know ... he was a HUGE part of their peak years of '69 to '75 , when they did their best work.

5962388,5,B00F0JG7E4,"I am the Stones Authority. How do you not love this? The Stones playing their native London, England, 50 years after the fact? I am watching it right now so to be sure to write an accurate review! This is the 8th time I am watching it on Blu-Ray for folks scoring at home. Okay, they are old. We can't skirt it anymore. They are playing the hits, not much original material here, okay. Given that, if I should've ponied up whatever money I had to fly there and pay the scalpers what they wanted. This show is fantastic! Nothing bad here. People are complaining about the pace of the editing!? Really!? Who are these dead goofs!? This is easily the best produced, best photographed and best edited performance video that the Stones have ever done, bar none. See my other reviews for relative comparison. This beautiful presentation makes up for anything that 50 years has taken away from the band. These versions of these songs leave you feeling flush. Hi-Lites!? All of it, including ""It's Only Rock and Roll"",  ""Ruby Tuesday"" - Just about want to cry when I hear and see this version. ""You've Got the Silver"" with Keith, fantastic. My one criticism of this disk is that the did not include in the regular show or the extras Mick Taylor playing ""Can't You Hear Me Knockin'"".  Hey, ""Midnight Rambler"" and Taylor are a beautiful thing. Stupid Bill Wyman!  Taylor is awesome. ""Midnight Rambler"" - probably not played live since when? 71? 72? Here it is with Mick Taylor and it just rocks. But I have already seen the bootleg videos on YouTube of ""Can't You Hear Me Knockin'"" and that is far more satisfying for a Stones purist by a long stretch. By a very long stretch! Let us all hope that it surfaces somewhere on a professional release and soon. My one big huge complaint about this release. Damn, how good is it to see Taylor rocking with them? Doesn't it bring it all back? Everything that was good and amazing about ""Sticky Fingers"", ""Exile On Main Street"", or ""Goats Head""?

All right, they all look like hell, but they are so good. Instead off us all saying, ""They look like old farts"", shouldn't we be asking, ""Why does music today suck so bad?"", And why has it really sucked for more than 20+ years now?

State your case. Who in the last 20+ plays as good as these old F's do on this disk production? Kiss my ass. No one.

This video just goes on and on delivering the goods. Unfortunately, it can't give you everything that you want, despite the really good version of ""You Can't Always Get What You Want"". There is just too much that the Stones could do. Could've done for this night, at this time, at this place. ""Sway"", ""Beast of Burden"", ""Waiting On a Friend"", ""Brand New Car"", ""Biggest Mistake"", ""Moonlight Mile"". Fifty years. Fifty incredible years. Watch this video, play all of your albums, CD's, DVD's celebrate everything it is to be the Stones. To be a Stones fan. Dear God, I love this band!",1386028800,12,2911,4.514231499051234

Again, under Leavell's ""direction,"" and with several backup singers and a horn section, they're just a ""tribute band"" now.  I have a DVD of the last Stones performance in Hyde Park, kind of ""mirth-less,"" too - it was the ""memorial to Brian Jones"" gig.  Bad as they were in 6/69, with Mick Taylor just having joined, like, a month or so ago, they were no worse than now, bolstered by so many singers and ""backup musicians"" that effectively drown out the remnants of ""The Rolling Stones.""

I have literally every released record, both sides of the Atlantic, including all UK singles and LP's, all first press plus some promo and demo stuff worth thousands of dollars. So I'm a fan. I often crossed huge distances just to see them. I've seen them live I can't remember how many times. I won't talk about the video production, I'm gonna talk about music alone. This is by far, as far as sound production, their worst live recording. Trust me. Take all the old records from your shelves, all of you who have them, not to mention the famed ""Get Yer Ya-ya's Out!"", and try to compare. Sound is terrible. But what is by far the worst thing of it all is Mick's singing. He sings like he an old lady close to some weird falsetto. His voice is too high and artificial. And I am really sad because there seem to be some very nice new and fresh arrangements of most of the tracks, although I'm used to much slower renditions. It seems they were in a hurry to squeeze in as many tracks as possible.",1384992000,8,1040,4.284263959390863

5962406,3,B00F0JG7E4,"I was expecting a good 50th anniversary concert, but I'm not impressed with this new RS release. First the performance is not one of their best.  Probably because they all look seventies and perform as is, they have not the same energy as before.  You will notice a big difference with their last concert  films (The Biggest Bang and Shine a light).  Second, the film editing is poor: too many screen shot changes (1 to 6-8 seconds each screen view), too many audience shots, historical commentairies and screen shots.  It would have been better to make a decent documentary with those last two screen shots types. For my first viewing, I wasn't able to enjoy each song chapter, I was instinctively skipping to the next.  All in all, to be honest, 3 stars is the max I could give to this release. If you are an inconditional, buy it.  The best thing of this release, is the stage presence of Mick Taylor for 2 songs.  If you look for one, if not the best, of the best RS concert film, look for Briges to Babylon.",1384560000,,1012,4.4324324324324325

I didn't get to see the Stones live until their Steel Wheels tour even though I'd dreamed about attending one of their concerts for years. Since then I've been to a show on every tour right up until the most recent show at Staples Center in Los Angeles on May 3 2013. I'm one of the crazies who not only splurged for a floor seat but also for one of only 600 leather jackets!
They're one of the very few bands I save up for so I can really treat myself.
I've been waiting and hoping that sooner or later they'd release one ( or more ) of the shows from the most recent tour on DVD/Blu-Ray. This set has everything I'd hoped for and more. It's a real treat for me to see the Hyde Park show from 1969; way before I ever thought I'd see them. And the book with the photos is very well done.

My goldfish with it's 2 second attention span loved it!  I have a normal human attention span and just couldn't get locked into the show, ever.  Which is too bad because the quaility of everything is the best I've ever seen!

If the Sweet Summer Sun production and editing team ever read this, please release this film again editied to properly enjoy the brilliant camera work.

And that's difficult to say since I believe that Martin Scorsese's ""Shine A Light"" was brilliant. The quality of the video as well as the audio is outstanding. I have to disagree with some of the other reviews which mention the quick shots of the band as well as the shots of the crowd. The film is recorded just like any other concert footage but some of the angles captured I believe are fantastic. At times you feel like you're walking around the stage with the band. The crowd shots capture the intensity of the concert. I'm from the US but there's nothing like watching the excitement of a European audience. I'm not sure exactly what it was but so many times while watching this DVD I kept saying ""WOW"" to myself. Watch this on a large screen and crank up the volume until the speakers want to pop.

5962412,4,B00F0JG7E4,"The Rolling Stones whose absence from the stage since 2005-2007's ""Bigger Bang Tour"" return in 2013 on their 50th Anniversary Tour.  What began last December in New York, New Jersey and London continued on through an American Tour from May through June of this year and finished in Hyde Park on July 6th and July 13th.  The video, although over produced, shows the boys in good forming cranking out their hits including: ""Honky Tonk Woman,"" ""Ruby Tuesday,"" ""It's Only Rock N Roll,"" ""Jumping Jack Flash"", ""Sympathy for The Devil,"" ""Brown Sugar,"" and so much more. I Love Keith with ""You Got The Silver"" and ""Happy.""  The Highpoint of the concert for both the Video and CD is the addition of former Rolling Stones guitarist, Mick Taylor, on ""Midnight Rambler."" Taylor left the group back in 1975 and was replaced by Ronnie Wood.  Taylor played with the boys back in December of 1981 in Kansas City on their ""Tattoo You"" tour, and the addition of his guitar adds to ""The Wall Of Sound"" on ""Midnight Rambler"" along with Mick on the harmonica. There are those die hard Stones fans who say that the Taylor years with the band were the best, and his chops on ""Midnight Rambler"" adds weight to that notion.  Wood and Taylor have 2 distinct styles of playing and are showcased when you listen to ""Rambler."" Although I am purist at heart, and like the Stones in their ""Raw"" form minus the over editing and producing, ""Sweet Summer Sun"" does not disappoint.  It is a snapshot of the band and its place in history as the greatest Rock and Roll Band in Rock's 60 year history.",1384387200,6,1563,4.60431654676259

The ADD award goes to director Paul Dugdale.  He seems to think we want a new shot every half second and that we're more interested in the goofballs in the crowd than we are in the Rolling Stones!  I really wouldn't mind if all the obnoxious crowd footage were completely removed from this show.  It's bad enough that we never really see the performance the way it should be seen - from the perspective of the audience.  It's like we're there on stage BEHIND the performers, or off to the side.  Very rarely do we see them from the front.  It's a real shame that such an awesome event wasn't captured better!  The quality of the images is awesome.

5962415,5,B00F0JG7E4,"After 50 years, it is impressive to see the energy that this band brings to this concert. Keith Richards begins by saying that ""A gig is a gig."" The concert DVD begins with some background on the Hyde Park concert--and the last time that the Rolling Stones played here. Obvious is their age. Man, I remember seeing them on TV when they were young and fresh faces in the music world. The concert DVD is pretty well done. The staging is pretty impressive. No need to go over every song (it would take too long), but a sampling follows:

""You Start Me Up."" An energetic version--not what one might expect of 70 year old musicians in rock and roll. Jagger dances and the band plays well. The rhythm section performs well (Charlie Watts and Darryl Jones). It looks, literally, like the band is enjoying itself performing after 50 years.

""It's Only Rock and Roll."" Nice feature in this set: names of early rockers on the screen behind the band--Bo Diddley, Jerry Leww Lewis, and so on. Nice guitar work. Chuck Leavell on keyboards does well.

""Street Fighting Man."" One of my favorites. ""Everywhere I hear the sound of marching charging feet. . ."" Keith and Ron look pretty old, but their guitar work is fresh. ""'Cuz in sleepy London town there's no place for a street fighting man."" Mick is very energetic in his singing and dancing.

""Honky Tonk Women."" Another classic rock and roll song. Still done energetically. Bobby Keyes and brass play well.

""Happy."" Keith's song. His voice is a wreck here (and has been for some time), but it works pretty well as a song.

""Midnight Rambler.""  After all these years, still an impressive look into a dark place. Mick Taylor (the successor to Brian Jones and the predecessor of Ron Wood) joins the Stones to goods effect, Then guitars of Wood, Taylor, and Richards--with Darryl Jones' bass--work well together. The guitars create a wall of sound--with Jagger on harmonica adding to the effect.

""Jumping Jack Flash."" One of the great guitar riffs. Watts' drumming is a wonder here. Wood and Richards play well off of one another. It seems somewhat surprising to me that the Stones actually seem to still enjoy performing together.

""Sympathy for the Devil."" Stage goes dark. Telling and chilling images on the screen behind the band. Then, the first few notes. ""Please allow me to introduce myself."" Keith does a nice solo.

""Brown Sugar."" Up tempo and surprisingly fresh.

""(I Can't Get  No) Satisfaction."" Mick Taylor returns, to good effect. The fuzztone begins the song--and here we go. A great deal of energy and a freshness to the band's approach.

Overall? A terrific concert album.",1384214400,7,2627,4.772626931567329
5962416,5,B00F0JG7E4,"Frankly, I can't believe the 3 star or worse ratings for this.

This is an outstanding document of ""the greatest rock and roll band in the world."" Beautiful presentation in a sturdy hard bound book, with the DVDs and bluray on one side of the book, and the CDs at the end of the book.

The book is fantastic, as it transitions from the 1969 performance in black and white pages, to full color, depicting the most recent performance.

The 1969 video of the Hyde Park performance is included. The video and sound of the recent performance is excellent. I'm not bothered by the camera angles. I absolutely love the way this is shot....it looks, and sounds superb.

I had the iTunes recording of the show released a few months back, but the fidelity on CD is an upgrade.

I am excited and grateful to get this kind of release from the great Rolling Stones.....in 2013.

While most bands born of the 60's are releasing reissues of reissues of their catalog (yes, I know the Stones do this too), to have a band like these guys still releasing anything current, is a major achievement in and of itself.

This release is evidence of a band that still plays great rock and roll. Mick Jagger defies logic. That a 70 year old man can perform, move about the stage, and sing at this level.....really makes no sense. I think he is as good now, or better, than he was 20-30 years ago.
