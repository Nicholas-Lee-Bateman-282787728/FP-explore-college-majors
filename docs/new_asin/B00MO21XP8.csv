8673382,2,B00MO21XP8,"Just received this DVD today and so far am very unimpressed:  The inside workings along the spine are broken up--literally, pieces of it in the box itself.  Also, there was nothing to moor (no pun intended) the first disc on the inside of the front cover; the seller just tossed the first disc--loose--on top of the second disc.  All these comments, mind you, before even trying to play any of the discs.  Depending on what I find, this whole lot may be going back.",1512518400,,465,4.5
