8743698,4,B0192PER4S,"Well... if an outer space alien visted you and made you pregnant with a superhuman hybrid, you would be famous too !  I LOVE JESUS 100% and I believe people should not only follow teaching of love and kindness and peace, but also people should be figuring out HOW Jesus did these wonderful things.  Or more directly, set aside the mythology and research the science that can help us cure illness, regrow missing limbs,  heal blindness of eyes, minds, hearts and souls.  I never realized Mary had so many temples built for her all over the world.  I do believe Mary and Jesus would have been African in appearence, but their message of faith and hope can be enjoyed by all people of the world.
I look forward to the time when science and medicine has developed the many skills Jesus demonstrated so long ago.  Some say since he is God, he can travel through time and was showing us such wonderful inventions are possible.  Certainly people 2,000  years ago wpuld think our technology today is magic.  Sadly our  war like civilizations are still growing and have yet to bring Heaven on Earth.  Blessings to all who watch this beautiful video.",1499212800,,1140,4.621890547263682
