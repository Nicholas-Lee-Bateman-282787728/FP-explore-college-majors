3688469,3,B001LPWGD2,"Let's get the obvious out of the way first:  this movie is very very low budget.  But what a low budget!  The acting is as wooden as you'd expect for these kinds of films, so director Wiest wisely forgoes lengthy exposition and those annoying character speeches that are meant to be supposedly self-revealing for said character, and goes straight for the chase.  There are lots of pretty decent well choreographed chase and gun fight scenes.  Yes, the skeletons are a little tough to watch without smirking, but the fiery cowboy who shoots bullets of hellfire that incinerate his victims was BRILLIANT.  In all, Dead Noon does a great job synthesizing cowboy mythology and old-west clichs and giving it a semi-modern twist.  Case and point-the excellent music for the film.  As for the bizarre review that compared this film to bad acting in a porno, I've never watched porn so I wouldn't know about porn acting, but it's pretty obvious that that review knows what he likes and likes what he knows---and should stick with that.",1270339200,,1027,4.828571428571428
3688470,3,B001LPWGD2,"A very pleasant surprise. A friend suggested that I watch it, but I knew this was a very low budget movie so I really didn't expect much. However, it was better than I expected it to be. It actually kept me entertained. The production quality was definitely low-budget, however The special effects are impressive when you consider the budget, or lack thereof, that they had to work with. As for the acting, it was better than I expected. The performances by the actors Kane Hodder and Kelsey McCann, who were in effect setting up the story, are actually extraordinary. Definitely far superior to what I would expect to see from actors in a low-budget ""straight to DVD""  horror film.
 Again, I found it a fun way to spend an hour and a half. Just understand they obviously didn't have the budget of, say, Avatar.",1267747200,6,811,4.625
3688471,3,B001LPWGD2,"I really enjoyed Dead Noon.  It is sort-of a follow-up to the old movie High Noon, where the bad guy, when dying, says something like ""I'll get even -- I'll be back"".  It is supposed to be scary (maybe) but is really a comedy.  It has a lot of great lines and some fun action scenes.  I like the idea that it is told as a story.

The sheriff is really a cute guy with his dimple.  Wonder how they filmed him jumping over the deep canyon and almost slipping -- it looked real.

The extra things in the ""making of"" with the shower scenes are hilarious.

I recommend watching this for pure entertainment.  The first few minutes are pretty slow, but stick with it.  It's worth watching.

3688472,4,B001LPWGD2,"I really liked this movie, especially if you listen to the story being told it makes the movie even better.  It kept my interest and I was really surprised by the ending.  I'm going to watch it again because I know I will even catch more of the story.",1238544000,2,251,4.1020408163265305
3688473,5,B001LPWGD2,"I've read a lot of bad reviews on this movie, but I really liked it especially the beginning where you see Kane doing his normal thing - messing with people.  So as you can tell, I'm a huge Kane Hodder fan and will buy any movie he is in, directs, writes, and stunt coordinates.  Love ya, Kane.",1235347200,2,294,4.140350877192983
3688474,1,B001LPWGD2,"I watched this movie with my wife. We both enjoy zombie movies and I enjoy westerns as well as cult classics such as ""Night of the Living Dead"" and ""Return of the Living Dead"" so tongue-in-cheek comedic horror is not unwelcome in our DVD collection.

Unfortunately this movie failed to deliver. Kane Hodder plays his part well but the rest of the acting is substandard in our book as the characters' interaction is reminiscent of a bad porno movie...without the porn.

The soundtrack is awesome as well as the poker game in hell scenes, but if you're seeking a zombie western that in our opinion is worthy of the genre try ""Undead or Alive"" from DarkLot Entertainment.

Our favorite zombie horror/comedy movie to date is ""Dawn of the Dead"" from Universal studios.",1234051200,3,763,4.765151515151516
3688475,4,B001LPWGD2,"I got to ""preview"" this movie via a supermarket dvd; I hated it only because it was so cheaply made.  After I found out the cost to make it was $4,000, I thought, wow what a great movie for so little money.  I watched it again and - boy do I love this movie.  The story is great.  I listened closely to what they were talking about, rather than focusing my attention on the paperweight skeletons.  This is a love it or hate it movie, many will hate, but I got past that, and now I even love the cheap scenery and special effects.  The score is magnificent - reminds me of John Carpenter's Vampires score.  Plus - I love Kane Hodder.",1232409600,9,632,4.131147540983607
3688476,5,B001LPWGD2,"DEAD NOON won for Best Visual Effects, and an Honorable Mention, at the 2007 Tabloid Witch Awards in Santa Monica, CA.

The high concept is brilliant -- HIGH NOON done as a horror western.  As in HIGH NOON, some bandits return to take vengence on a sherrif, who recently married and stays to protect the town rather than run away with his wife.

The difference is, these bandits were killed by the sheriff's ancestor.  And they've been released not from prison, but from Hell.

DEAD NOON's energetic style evokes EVIL DEAD and the work of Quentin Tarentino.  A lively, gory, fun horror western, with a strong moral core.",1231718400,5,620,4.694444444444445

8319369,5,B001LPWGD2,This movie was made on a very low budget but it is very well made. The acting is good and the storyline is well written.,1391644800,,120,3.84
8319370,1,B001LPWGD2,"I'll cut to the chase; this movie looked like a bunch of jackasses with a cheap camera filmed this entire movie, the only time a real camera was used is during a narrator's rambling. If you're looking for an amateur's film to get some creative ideas, then rent this movie. If you want to watch this movie, i.e. enjoy it, save yourself the ten bucks for something worth while. I have nothing against indie films or amateuristic filming. I do, however, feel irritated when said film sucks more than a college girl desperate for rent.",1328140800,,531,4.6
8319371,1,B001LPWGD2,"I cant believe Lionsgate put this movie out. To say this movie was horrible,is an under statement. I just finished watching it and Im pissed off that I wasted my money.",1300838400,,168,4.451612903225806
8319372,4,B001LPWGD2,"This i found was an ok movie..it was not Great but i'am very glad i bought it!
well to be honest it was like a underground college film more than a Hollywood film
which i like it more anyway. on that subject Go get it from Amazon buy it and ENJOY!!!!",1299715200,4,250,3.9215686274509802
8319373,1,B001LPWGD2,"When I initially saw the three stars for the rating of this DVD, I thought I would give it a try. The first five minutes were well done and fairly interesting, but then when the flashbacks appeared on the screen, the awful suckiness of this movie was brutally manifest. Since the budget for this film was only $4,000, the only ""trick"" they had to use to create the flashback to the Western age of the 1800s was to overdevelop the film until everything is in a very harsh white color. This ""so-called effect"" does NOT work! It was very jarring to look at the screen like this. Then the awful ""acting"" of the unknown characters immediately became apparent when they opened their mouths to speak, and each of them became VERY ANNOYING to watch. After struggling to stick with this film for about 15 minutes, I finally jerked it out of my DVD in disgust and threw it hard into the trash.

Don't waste your time on this huge DUD of a film.",1289606400,2,934,4.398843930635838
8319374,2,B001LPWGD2,"Got this one because I like westerns and I like horror. So when I saw this movie was both, I jumped at it.  The reviews weren't good, but I took a chance.  I wish I had not! The special effects were laughable, the acting was horrible.  The sound quality was bad. The story was kinda stupid.  Overall, not a good movie.  The DVD cover was misleading.",1287964800,,349,4.2272727272727275
8319375,1,B001LPWGD2,"A long time ago a sheriff killed a man (Frank) and his thugs. Frank plays the devil in a game of poker in order to return to the surface and take revenge on the descendants of the sheriff and to make Ingmar Bergman (knight vs. death chess match) roll over in his grave. They start killing anything at random with bullets that burn people alive.

The special effects are not good. There are a lot of pauses in the dialogue. I don't mean the William Shatner overly frequent dramatic pauses, but the deer in the headlight pauses one has in order to attempt to gather their thoughts because they forgot their lines or some guy off camera fell asleep while moving the cards. It was so bad it was MST comical.

While everyone in the gang has been dead the same amount of time, they are all in various stages of decay, from skull, to just the eyes are missing. There are Italian zombie films better than this one. Is there a reason why one wears jungle camouflage pants in the desert? If you are going to make a cheap movie, at least make the dialogue entertaining. This movie is Ed Wood bad. I made the mistake of not watching it stoned. Don't you hate it when morons get a camera for Christmas?",1283644800,,1189,4.327354260089686
8319376,1,B001LPWGD2,"I bought this used, which i recommend if you want a good laugh, not as much as ""Zomieland"" good laugh, but more like...... hey I have a zombie movie plot and I know how to create flames on my fancy computer (the flames where horrible) lets get some of my college buddies and one hot girl (deputys wife) that would definetly look out of place, and make a movie.  This movie made me wish I had to take a massive dump, so I wouldn't have to push pause knowing I have come back and push play eventually.  I love zombie movies, I watch them with the bar set pretty low, low budget, lack of talent when it comes to acting and etc. But I should have known this movies was going to be waste of time by looking at the main menu, it looked cheeeeeeeeesssssy!(I added the extra ""E""s so you would have a slight idea, but I fore worn you theres still room for more) I did not bother finishing the movie but instead I watched Austin City Limits on pbs, K'naan and Mos Def were performing.  YOU SEE EVEN WRITING THIS REVIEW ABOUT THE DEAD NOON, IM STILL GETTING SIDE TRACKED.  The movie was confusing, at first you think there in the desert than theres rednecks with shotguns that would rather shoot first before they even know whats going on, so of course they die.  Theres a seen than had laughing only because it didn't make sense, a scene starts off with a car parked on the side of the road and a random no named character says ""Dude im starving, lets get a taco"" but instead of starting the car, they get get out and pop the hood as if their car is broken down, and when one of the demon zombie things walks up to them, one guys asks ""hey you think you help?"" then the demon zombie thing cocks his gun, and the guy takes off running, leaving you the viewer like ""wtf""... Long story short don't buy this movie with high hopes... Or average ...hopes?....Or low.... Or just watch pbs",1282953600,2,1871,4.24438202247191
8319377,1,B001LPWGD2,"Without a doubt, the worst, un-watchable, pathetic waste of time I have ever bought. Who ever gave this a good or average review must have been one of the producers of this ""movie"". No story, laughable special effects, untalented ""actors"", etc..
