3982223,5,B002SSPQDI,"Robin Williams, ever the comedian, never ceases to amaze with his antics; quips, quotes, humorous outlook on all aspects of life, love, happiness, work, and more. I'm never disappointed in anything Robin Williams has ever done, including the more serious side of him in some of his dramatic roles.",1270771200,2,297,5.081632653061225
3982224,5,B002SSPQDI,"I'm so glad this has finally come out on DVD.  I have the video version but it has been played so many times, I am thrilled to finally be able to own it on DVD.  Robin Williams Live at the Met is the funniest stand up I've ever seen.  It is from 1986 so younger viewers may not know too much about the political environment that Robin speaks of for this routine, but it hardly matters!  Sex, drugs, the birth of his child, all this is timeless, and we can all relate to him on these subjects.  You will not be disappointed in this performance, your side will be splitting from laughing so much!",1269907200,11,594,4.175438596491228

3982229,4,B002SSPQDI,"I have not viewed the DVD, as it is a gift, but if close to the original (beta max!) in content, I'm certain it will be great.",1399680000,,126,3.7037037037037037
3982230,1,B002SSPQDI,The picture on this DVD is very poor quality.  Also the video and the sound are not always in sync.  The person I bought it for has to continually stop and restart the disc in order to keep the video and sound in sync.,1389225600,,218,3.9318181818181817
3982231,1,B002SSPQDI,I was SOOO looking forward to this collection. I could tell within the first few seconds this was actually a VERY POOR copy from VHS to DVD. My first thought something was wrong when I noticed the pictures on the cover seemed Photoshoped in. AVOID this 2 disc set and let's hope they actually re-release this collection in OFFICAL form.,1388448000,,336,4.616666666666666
3982232,4,B002SSPQDI,"I was a little disappointed at the quality of the picture, but I was prepared for that from reading the other reviews! We have them both on VHS and was just SO excited to find them on DVD, and they were a fabulous as I remember!",1386547200,,228,3.9782608695652173
3982233,5,B002SSPQDI,Great DVD set. Had forgot just how funny the old Robbin Williams really was. Live at the MET just was too much... laughed till tears rolled.,1385683200,,140,4.423076923076923
3982234,3,B002SSPQDI,"This is definitely from his roots. I have original on VHS. DVD'd are nice to have but the picture quality and mixing leaves a lot to be desired. This harks back to Mork and Mindy days and when Dr. Toad and he had the Whisky River Inn in Arnold, CA",1382918400,,247,3.96
3982235,5,B002SSPQDI,Rodin Williams is the best. Also looking for bill Cosby stuff. Also rge delivery was fast. No issues. it was also easy to use the order form.,1381968000,,141,4.2592592592592595
3982236,5,B002SSPQDI,"This is a ""MUST HAVE"" for all fans of Robin Williams.
I first saw this in the 80's and it's still brilliant today",1381708800,,113,3.9565217391304346
3982237,1,B002SSPQDI,"The quality of this DVD set was extremely poor by my standards..( And I'm not that Picky)
I wouldn't order this again...",1377734400,,120,4.5
3982238,5,B002SSPQDI,Great dvd filled with fun and laughs!  Be sure not to be eating or drinking when watching because you'll lose it! Played great really enjoyed it.,1373500800,,145,4.576923076923077
3982239,5,B002SSPQDI,I love this DVD Robin is great very funny I laughed my ass off he covers a great many subjects if you like Robin Williams and I do you ll  love this one.,1372291200,,153,3.6363636363636362
3982240,4,B002SSPQDI,"A nice set, especially if you love Robin Williams like I do. My only warning is that the audience is a bit distracting as in all ""LIVE"" shows in such a big place. Smaller audiences give you the feeling of the humor, without all the noise drowning out the comedian. GREAT material though and as always, Robin Williams is hilarious!",1371945600,,330,4.516666666666667
3982241,3,B002SSPQDI,The encore part of the Live From the Met show is not watchable.  It doesn't play at all.  The visual is distorted as well as the audio.  I would have been happier with a perfect Met performance rather than that and the Evening with Robin Williams.,1370131200,,247,4.326086956521739
3982242,5,B002SSPQDI,These DVDs are so much fun. Robin WIlliams at his best and the audience reactions add to the experience. I feel like now I have 2 DVDs to trun to when I am having a tough day. They will definitely cheer me up.,1367280000,,209,3.883720930232558
3982243,4,B002SSPQDI,"Every time Mr. WIlliams opens his mouth, I get ready to laugh.  These performances are solid and very entertaining.  There weren't any ""laugh until you can't breathe"" moments, but good laughs beginning to end.",1365897600,,209,5.117647058823529
3982244,5,B002SSPQDI,We've liked Robin Williams for years and have been looking everywere for this DVD and finally found it.  Love the skits on this.,1365465600,,128,4.565217391304348
3982245,5,B002SSPQDI,"WHO DOESN'T LOVE ROBIN WILLIAMS.FOUND THIS PRICE WAS THE LOWEST AND DIDN'T TAKE VERY LONG TO RECEIVE.
WORKS GREAT NO PROBLEMS",1364169600,,125,5.0
3982246,4,B002SSPQDI,I always wanted to own this title. One of the funniest performances by any comedian!!! Robin Williams is hyper fantastic.,1360713600,,121,5.1
3982257,5,B002SSPQDI,"This was a great 2 DVD set!  Robin Williams is hilarious.  I had one DVD that would not play, notified the seller, and they sent me another one that worked!  The seller was great!  I will probably buy more Robin Williams DVD's, his standup is superb!",1359676800,,250,4.369565217391305
3982258,5,B002SSPQDI,A million laughs and more! Don't laugh too hard or you will miss some great jokes. We had this on VHS years ago and were so excited to get it on DVD.,1358467200,,149,3.6875
3982259,5,B002SSPQDI,Like everyone else wish HBO would release this on DVD. In the meantime this works. You also get a bonus 2nd Robin Willams performance DVD.,1358035200,6,138,4.56
3982260,4,B002SSPQDI,"The only reason that I've given this a 4 star rating rather than a 5 is that the video transfer could have been done better - the aspect ratio is off, making everything seem just a little wider than it actually is. It's also just a bit grainy, though not that noticeable. Sound is good, and you could even listen to it with your eyes closed... but with Robin Williams, the video is at /least/ half the fun.

As far as content... 5 out of 5. Heck, 6 out of 5.

This is some of Robin Williams' best work - a two DVD set, ""An Evening With Robin Williams"" (San Francisco, 1982) and ""Live at The Met"" (New York, 1986).

Some of the absolute best stuff that he has ever done. So funny that you had better be alone when you watch it, and there better not be anyone else in the house... because you will be laughing out loud so hard that you might disturb the neighbors.

This is the total 'stream of consciousness' humor that made Robin Williams famous in the first place. Sure, he's got subjects that he wants to joke about... but anything can set him off and make him take a different path, usually with humerous results. There's plenty of audience interaction in both of these shows - in fact, that's where half the humor comes from, where he riffs on something that someone in the audience may have said, or where he actually wanders out into the audience and comments on their fur coat or their hairdo... totally off the wall funny.

Two of his best live show videos ever... the only thing to wonder at is why these have been given life by the Australians (they obviously know a good thing when they see it), and why the American companies haven't done anything...

If you like off-the-wall humor, if you like comedy that knows no boundaries, if you like stuff that will totally make you laugh your butt off... grab these - quickly.",1323302400,,1830,4.367647058823529
3982261,5,B002SSPQDI,Seen these before want them on DVD I have not recieved my DVD only  few days old but as I said seen these shows believe me take a deep breath and hold your ribs !,1320192000,,162,3.6285714285714286
3982262,2,B002SSPQDI,"Robin Williams gets 5 stars plus, but the ""DVD's"" I received aren't real.

We still have the VHS of Live at the Met and were thrilled to find the DVD which arrived just today. I was shocked to find that these are not true DVD's at all - they are simply the VHS versions copied to DVD-r's with inkjet printed labels.

I'm not an expert on all things DVD, and it says these are from Australia, but I'm very concerned that we didn't get what we actually paid for.",1314230400,10,460,4.157303370786517
3982263,5,B002SSPQDI,Show what he was like first starting out. He more up front with the people. He keeps you laughing from start to finish and never stop bring the laughs.,1302566400,3,151,4.241379310344827
3982264,5,B002SSPQDI,"My husband has talked about this show for years (no kidding). He states it is just the best, however we no longer have a VHS player. I searched hi-and-low for years and here it is!!!! We finally watched last night and I will admit, it was great! This is Williams at his best and a great value. Buy this if you want to laugh.",1293667200,2,324,4.078125
3982265,4,B002SSPQDI,"I have wanted to replace this material in my collection for years. Though this is one of his very early routines, it must rank as one of the funniest and most profound hours of comedy ever recorded. Mr Williams moves effortlessly from subject to subject engaging the audience continuously. For the younger watchers, the political references of the times may confuse but the sentiment is right on point. Enjoy this funny, witty and timeless recording with friends and you will see his genius on their faces.",1286755200,5,506,4.895348837209302
3982266,5,B002SSPQDI,"Bonjour. Sorry if you find typos, it'll probably be the computer's fault or the fact that I'm French speaking from Rimouski in Eastern Quebec (that's the the city where Sydney Crosby played his junior hockey - for those who care). In anycase, I've been a longtime fan of Robin Williams. I do recall having bought the cassette of this same show in another lifetime. Having it in DVD was a real treat(?) down memory lane. I really laughed my head off once again. I recommend it to anyone in need of something (whatever). Enjoy!",1271203200,,525,4.595744680851064

8379573,5,B002SSPQDI,"Who doesn't love Robin Williams. LOVE this DVD. When you purchase this item you need to remember when these performances were done. The technology for filming were not as developed as it is today so the color is not as sharp, BUT there is no problem with the filming it's self. I purchased this for my husband as a gift. When were having a rough day we simply through in one of Robins DVD's and have a laugh.",1448668800,,408,4.243589743589744

8379577,5,B002SSPQDI,In my opinion this was his funniest work (other than Mork & Mindy). I had Robin Williams sign it 3 years ago. Thankfully I have this DVD to remind us of him.,1419811200,,157,3.9375
