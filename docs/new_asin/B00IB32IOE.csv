8689392,5,B00IB32IOE,"What a pleasent surprise this dvd is.  Being a foreign import I was expecting a repackaging of their 1st dvd ""Fly Jefferson Airplane"".  There is only about 2 songs repeated on this one.  The title opening is a live instrumental portion of ""Fat Angel"" propably recorded at one of the Fillmores.  There's only a few interviews between songs & some are quite funny. Included are 3 performances from the ""Dick Cavett Show"", ""White Rabbitt"" from the ""Smothers Bros. Show"", their portion from the Rolling Stones ""Gimme Shelter"" where Marty gets stomped by the Hell's Angels at Altamont. both songs from ""Monterey Pop"" a repeat of ""High Flying Bird"" & the horrible camerawork during ""Today"" where Marty sings lead & yet the camera only focuses on Grace (disgraceful). A live performance from the ""Ed Sullivan Show"" of ""Crown of Creation"" (very cool), ""Eskimo Ble Day"" from the PBS special, a psychedelic video of ""Greasy Heart"", Joan Rivers interviewing Grace.  The real surprise is a live performance in concert of ""Wooden Ships"" that had to be recorded late 1970 including their awesome light show. There's no info on this song but Grace was pregnant, Papa John & Joey Covenington were both in the group & Marty had a full beard. I saw this tour at that time. Finally it ends with a clip from the foreign film ""Stamping Ground"". If there's a downside at all..there is no chapter section on the menu so you have to fast forward on repeat viewings. Some of the picture content isn't perfect nor the sound (after all being recorded mostly in the '60's) but a little adjusting on my blue-ray player & I am really thrilled to get some new Jefferson Airplane footage when they are so hard to come by..If you're an Airplane fan I URGE you to get this ASAP...you won't be disappointed!",1404691200,8,1772,4.7216828478964405
