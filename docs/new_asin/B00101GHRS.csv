8236462,4,B00101GHRS,"Fascinating account of the details of the movements of the USS Pueblo...from BOTH sides. Anyone with a rudimentary knowledge of time, speed, and distance and basic navigation will immediately see the North Korean evidence submitted as justification for their attack on and seizure of the Pueblo as complete drek.

Further reading on the ""incident"" will however bring to light the total lack of preparation and naivete on the part of the US Navy and US intelligence services to support the Pueblo before, during, and after the attack and seizure.",1391904000,,545,5.123595505617978

8236464,1,B00101GHRS,"I thought that documentary was boring, and one sided. It is obvious that there is more to this story instead of the propaganda given to us by our country.

8236466,5,B00101GHRS,"It would have been more honest if this information had been made available years ago.
There has been nearly 40 years of second-guessing scrutiny from arm-chair quarterbacks.
Finally, ...the official word, ...Pueblo did nothing wrong!

8236467,5,B00101GHRS,"""The Pueblo Incident"" is a new video from the US National Archives. The program is a 25 minute briefing given by a Lieutenant with US Naval Intelligence. From the presenters narrative it appears to have been made in late January or early February 1969. The briefing centers exclusively on the forged evidence presented by North Korea to justify the attack and seizure of the USS Pueblo AGER-2 on January 23, 1968.
 North Korea took Pueblo's navigator's working logs and navigational charts they had seized and began a concerted program of forging each and every entry to make it appear Pueblo intruded into their 12 mile territorial waters on a number of occasions. The program shows all the claimed ""intrusion"" points were in fact additions or outright forgeries. Pueblo's flank speed was 12.5 knots. To make all of the North Korean claims of intrusion, Pueblo would have to be capable of making at absolute minimum 15 knots and in one case 2500 knots!
 In addition to debunking the forged North Korean evidence the briefer makes references to the exact position of Pueblo and the reported positions of the SO-1 subchaser and the P4 motor torpedo boats during  the attack. During the prelude to the attack and the attack itself all ships were in international waters 16 miles from the nearest point of North Korean territory, namely Yo Do Island.
 Viewers might wonder why it took the US government 38 years to declassify this video briefing. The key part of the information released is the position reports made by the North Korean vessels. US and South Korean facilities were monitoring and recording all communications made by the attacking ships and their home base at Wonsan. To release this information at the time would have been considered a serious compromise of classified information!
 For historians, this is an extremely important addition to what is known as ""The Pueblo Incident."" For the crewmembers of Pueblo who went through the attack, capture, imprisonment, tortures and recriminations when finally coming home, it is 38 years overdue.
