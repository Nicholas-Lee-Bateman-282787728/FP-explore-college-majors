8417763,4,B00475AQNK,"This was my first video of ocean waves, so I had high hopes. The video camera was not still in some spots. There are some nice pans backwards showing the houses by the beach, and for the most part the camera was set still towards the waves. A couple spots of birds walking by. For the first minute the video jumps eradically, possibly because of manufacture defect. The last 20 minutes? is on a separate section that you must play to continue. Overall, it was relaxing and did what I bought it for.",1339977600,3,498,4.365591397849462
