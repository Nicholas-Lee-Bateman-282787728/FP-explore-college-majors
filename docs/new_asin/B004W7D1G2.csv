4485649,4,B004W7D1G2,"When you see in bold letters ROGER CORMAN PRESENTS, you know you're in for a gloriously awful cheese fest!  DINOCROC vs. SUPERGATOR surely fits the bill.
  It's a horror buff's guilty pleasure---goofy plot and special effects; the ubiquitous direction of Jay Andrews (AKA the infamous Jim Wynorski) and the presence of a name ""star"" (this time the late David Carradine).  Add a wannabe Elijah Wood (Corey Landes), an Indiana Jones complete with hat named the Cajun (the character, not the hat!) whose ""real"" names is Rib Hillis!!  Why not Kidney Beene or Penis Envy??  Also throw in FALCON CREST's John Callahan as the local sheriff.  What a casting coup!
Now, is it great?  NOOOO!  But is it a hoot?  YES!  The so-called epic confrontation lasts about 30 seconds with our hero Landes hiding in a water trough!  Gadzooks!  Sit-com material fersure!
Ah, well break out the Milk Duds and/or popcorn and enjoy the benefits of another Corman blockbuster!",1311292800,3,950,4.936708860759493
4485650,3,B004W7D1G2,"The only reason i would pay $17.99 for a cheesey SyFy movie like this is so they could afford better special affects for future movies. The original Dinocroc was much better and was somewhat creative. The idea for a low budget cheesey flick was a really good idea for just one movie, maybe a few. But making an endless amount of movies all sharing the same plot and storyling gets annoying after a while, and is definetly not worth that price. Roger Corman, you already made this movie in 20 kinda-different ways before, so why should i buy 20 of kinda the same movie? Other than that it's good though.",1309824000,,602,4.4818181818181815

4485652,5,B004W7D1G2,"This movie is fantastic.  It is a total throwback to all the old SciFi monster movies.  I am actually surprised they didn't use stage prop monsters.

Seriously though, this movie is all about having a good time.  Don't expect a deep plot, profound lesson, or complex characters.  Do expect monsters, cheesy special effects, and of course girls in bikinis (oh... and a girl with an comically large gun with infinate ammo).

This movie is pure AWESOMENESS!

I can't wait to get this on blu-ray.",1304294400,13,492,4.785714285714286

4485705,4,B004W7D1G2,"This is number three in the movie series (I've yet to find the second movie, Supergator, made in 2007).  It follows the same formula as the first film (Dinocroc) in that a research lab has created not one but two abnormal creatures that escape into the wild (this time lovely Hawaii gets to host the smack-down).  The bad guy in this movie is the late David Carradine, appropriately grumpy.  He has a sidekick assassin helper, a croc killing expert known as the Cajun (Rib Hillis), and a supposedly crack team of mercenaries (they barely add up to a snack).  None are particularly effective in getting rid of the angry beasties.  Also crawling around in the underbrush are a couple of cops and an agent of some kind (Corey Landis) who wants to expose Carradine's nefarious dealings.  The monster gator and croc stomp around and chomp around the island (the body count is well over 20, on screen).  Most of the action is confined to a few set pieces.  There's nothing really remarkable about this effort because it really doesn't do anything unexpected or new.  It sticks to the usual formula that's heavily relied on for movies like this (Corman's in particular).  In that regard, it doesn't disappoint.  It is entertaining, despite being so predictable.  It's something I can easily watch multiple times, so it goes into the collection.",1407974400,,1337,4.815789473684211

4485719,3,B004W7D1G2,"Two giant croc-type animals escape from an experimental lab in Hawaii and nearly kill everyone one. David Carradine is the owner of the lab and wants to keep everything quiet. He brings in a military team to kill the crocs, only to discover fake TV bullets don't kill giant fake crocs. The team is killed, do next Carradine calls in ""The Cajun"" an American version of Crocodile Dundee, down to the hat. As the body count increases, so do suspicions. People who successfully escape one croc at one water hole always wind up at the place where the other croc is located.

In addition to men in uniforms, the crocs also feed off of girls in bikinis. Our Cajun hunter teams up with the local authorities to hunt down the crocs, the same people Carradine wants to hide everything from. If the crocs don't kill you, Carradine's men (or woman) will. The final scene was so bad it might as well have been clay-mation.

No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Fake looking creatures, CG muzzle flashes (these actually match the sound) bad lines, bad acting, bad science. Would have been a great movie for 9 year old males in 1960.

If you like watching Asylum films while stoned, such as Moby Dick, or Mega-Shark vs. whatever, then you can't miss this one.",1341273600,3,1235,4.579185520361991
4485720,4,B004W7D1G2,I happen to enjoy the scifi channel monster flicks. With a name like Dinocroc vs Supergator you can't expect more that what this is. It is not Avatar but a good couple of hours of laughs.,1329436800,,187,4.222222222222222
4485721,2,B004W7D1G2,"Wow, talk about ""over acting"", this is a great example for want-to-be actors to watch to see ""What Not To Do.""  The actors do every movement so big - pull their guns out to make sure you know they have guns, count to 3 before breaking down the door...the nurse scene after character was shot was a joke!

I guess if you are into a retro, ""over-the-top,"" sci-fi movie where the blood and guts make you laugh as opposed to make you hide your eyes, this may be the movie for you.  My 10-year-old son loved it!  And I will confess that I did jump during one scene.  Guess it's all in the eye of the beholder.",1320969600,,604,4.128205128205129
4485722,1,B004W7D1G2,"Judge Dan Mancini, DVD Verdict-- For the most part, Roger Corman's low-budget collaborations with the Syfy network have failed to entertain even as camp, but Dinocroc vs. Supergator is especially egregious--most likely because Syfy passed on the project early on, forcing Corman and company to whip it together on an even smaller budget than usual. One of the notable hallmarks of Corman's made-for-TV and straight-to-video renaissance is the use of hokey, PG-rated CGI monster violence. It doesn't get any hokier or PG-rated than the kills in Dinocroc vs. Supergator, which mostly recycle the same two effects over and over again: some dope or a couple of horny vacationers are snatched from the edge of the water by the poorly composited digital Supergator, or some dope or a couple of horny vacationers look up and scream before being snatched by the Velociraptor-like Dinocroc, their rubbery CGI arms and legs twitching in his equally rubbery mouth as he swallows them down. Both shots are incredibly cheesy, and they each happen at least a half dozen times throughout the picture. The movie's CGI cheapness is so blatantly cynical in its execution that it completely fails to entertain even as kitsch.

The movie lands on Blu-ray in a 1080p/AVC transfer framed at 1.78:1. The high definition treatment serves the movie well during the over-used aerial shots of Kauai meant to make the production look far more expensive than it actually was, but only exposes the gross limitations of the digital monster effects. To be clear, I've seen a plethora of these modern made-for-TV monster movies. I know that they tend to revel in the camp of their substandard visual effects, but the CGI in Dinocroc vs. Supergator is unusually bad even for the genre.

The Dolby TrueHD audio mix in 5.1 surround makes decent use of the entire soundstage, including some directional panning, but doesn't reach far enough into the low frequencies to really impress. One expects some thump and rumble in a movie about giant reptiles, but this track doesn't deliver.

An audio commentary featuring Corman and Wynorski actually makes the movie infinitely more entertaining as the duo pulls no punches in detailing their cheapskate ways during the production--from getting a major discount from the aerial tours company they used to shoot Kauai by featuring their logo-emblazoned helicopter prominently in the feature, to using not-so-clever editing to limit the number of actors they had to fly to the Hawaiian islands from the mainland.

The only other extra is a trailer for the movie.

Dinocroc vs. Supergator works neither as a monster movie nor an unintentional comedy. It's an awful waste of 87 minutes.

8444652,3,B004W7D1G2,"""Dinocroc Vs. Supergator"" is a formulaic dueling giant creature film starring the late David Carradine in one of his last performances as the evil Jason Drake. With Roger Corman as an executive producer, it would be hard to go wrong in this genre, and while this installment is entertaining, it's definitely nothing groundbreaking or original either. Set in Kauai, the dinocroc escapes the lab of the evildoers and begins feasting on humans within the first minute of the movie. The film has lots of terrible dialogue (""Stop prayin' and start shootin'!"") that gets especially pernicious when the romantic banter with the cute conservation officer (Cassidy Swanson, played by Amy Holt) begins, though the very worst dialogue is reserved for the atrocious bikini-clad girls at the pool (who are mercifully devoured quickly). ""The Cajun"" (Rib Hillis) is the specialist hunter who has been summoned to help dispose of the rampaging duo. There are subplots about weaponized reptiles and illegal military development, mushrooms two feet tall, a backstory involving a horrible British woman, Victoria (Lisa Clapperton), who is Drake's enforcer, a brother and sister scientist team at a moral crossroads, and a Hollywood director schmuck in a hot tub who makes a light refreshment for dinosaurs.

Yes, there's a lot going on, and almost none of it matters because you came to see two giant lizards fighting. After much technobabble about the DNA matrix and other junk science and an instance of inappropriate defibrillator use, the Cajun and the cute twenty-something law enforcement couple herd the dinocroc and supergator together with a helicopter so The Cajun only has to kill off the survivor. As the cops close in on Drake's house, there is a bit of action and some death in what may the most contrived scene in sci-fi history (and that's saying something). Not to be outdone, an Elvis-centric tour group encounters a giant alligator in a cinematic moment that is totally unique.

Jim Wynorski (who directed this under the alias Jay Andrews) is a competent director, and ""Dinocroc Vs. Supergator"" is an enjoyable if mindless diversion for fans of B-movies. The DVD also has a commentary with Corman and Wynorski, which I enjoyed almost as much as he film itself. It also features a trailer and English or Spanish subtitles if you want them. If you like big dumb rubber-suited monster movies (or their CGI equivalents) you'll find this worth a look.",1480809600,,2446,5.082089552238806
