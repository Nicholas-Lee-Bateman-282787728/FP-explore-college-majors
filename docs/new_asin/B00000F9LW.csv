4403610,2,B00000F9LW,"Not a bad western, with a good cast of character actors. The problem is the picture quality isn't very good(although certainly watchable) but this is a black and white print of a color film.",1253145600,7,190,4.617647058823529
4403611,1,B00000F9LW,"I first saw a preview of New Mexico at the St. James cinema in Brisbane in the early 1950s. As a young boy I was most impressed. It is a typical western from the 1950s, similar to Bugles in the Afternoon and Warpath. The film was photographed in Ansco color but this VHS transfer is in black and white and consequently it does not do justice to the landscape photography. In fact, this VHS transfer is a total disgrace and the video production company should hang its head in shame. Much of the tape is so dark that it is unwatchable. The picture is grainy and out of focus. I am sorry that I purchased this video for it was a complete waste of money. I am going to throw the tape in the rubbish bin as I have no use for it. So prospective buyers, please take heed and do not purchase this VHS tape.",1247011200,2,799,4.128205128205129
