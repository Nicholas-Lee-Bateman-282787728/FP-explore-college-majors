6817754,4,B00PLYTIW6,A good story and very good acting.  This movie is really sweet and a pleasure to watch although it is also rather sad.  There is plenty of goodhearted humor and light spirited fun which leaves one feeling happy.  I recommend this movie.,1425513600,3,236,4.571428571428571
6817755,5,B00PLYTIW6,Can't add much to what another reviewer already stated. Saw this on the Up station. Excellent performances all around.,1422748800,5,118,5.2631578947368425
6817756,5,B00PLYTIW6,"A Girl's Best Friend is a sneaky movie that just aired on the UP channel. I say ""sneaky"" because it puts up this front of being a happy-go-lucky tale about a girl and a dog but then ambushes you with how emotional it gets. 12-year-old Penelope Daught (Lilah Fitzgerald) and her ailing single mom (Kirsten Robek) have just moved to Seal Bay, and it's been a struggle. Penelope's mom is in dire need of a liver transplant and she's failing rapidly. Most days she can't leave the house, she's that weak. This leaves Penelope - oh, she prefers to be called ""Polka Dot"" - fending for herself and trolling the local coffee shop seeking odd jobs. It's at the coffee shop that she runs into K-9 Unit police officer Cooper Brawn (James Denton) and his search dog Luey. She promptly extends her services as a kennel cleaner. Officer Brawn turns her down. There's that girl, Polka Dot, not taking no for an answer.

It's young Lilah Fitzgerald's movie all the way. She's fantastic and so very engaging! It helps that her character is a bit of an eccentric. For one, she dotes on Mark Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. She identifies so with Huck's plight. Some other kid actress could've made it all too precious. Fitzgerald is a natural. She's so brimming with life and pluck and yet, when called for, she has this ability to break your heart. Her scenes with Robek (who plays her mom) are superb stuff and tender and tremendously moving.

Denton is super-likable as Cooper, the carefree K-9 officer (dude lives on a houseboat). I don't think it's a spoiler when I say that Cooper does cave and puts the little girl on an unofficial stipend for cleaning the police kennel. This allows him free time to pine for his ex-fiance (Laura Mennell) who broke off the engagement because of his flightiness. Oh, yeah, the ex-fiance happens to work for Child Protective Services. But that can't possibly be relevant.

I don't see how you can't be moved by this movie. I am a manly man and I own up to having had to grope for the hankie. This kid, Lilah Fitzgerald, will keep your eyes glued to the screen and invested in the story. She'll have you smiling and marveling at how spirited she is and how audacious she is, and, later, she'll have you on the brink of the weeps. A Girl's Best Friend ain't much of a movie title. But the movie's merit lies in the wonderful acting and the orchestration of the many poignant beats and the high degree of artistry and entertainment value. I choose to ignore the lapses in credibility. Maybe someone as resourceful and with so much gumption as this girl really can with regularity sneak a police dog out of the precinct and take it home with her. If she can do that, it's no shakes to slip that same dog into the hospital to visit her mom. It's harder to overlook Cooper's dropping the kid off at her house and then leaving her there without making sure there's an adult around, especially after the scare she'd just had (sorry, I won't spoil). So, you see, I've pointed out some flaws. And so what? I'm still rating this 5 out of 5 stars. I actually sort of love this movie. I'm really impressed by that girl. Penelope ""Polka Dot"" Daught is a phenomenal character, and that's coming from a guy who prefers Tom Sawyer to Huck Finn.",1420502400,22,3261,4.523728813559322

6817759,1,B00PLYTIW6,"Looks to be good movie, but how can a person watch with no sound of what people are saying.  Perhaps for a good lip/mouth reader.  I even restarted my tablet and no such luck hear background noises that's it!",1473465600,,208,4.3076923076923075

6817762,5,B00PLYTIW6,This is one of the most touching movies UP has ever produced.  I loved it. Wish I could have given it 10 stars.  Its about a little girl who's Mom is terminally ill and how this little girl functions while her Mom is dying.  Then it shows a happier ending for all concerned.  I wouldn't recommend it if you just lost someone recently as I've spent the last 45 minutes crying through it but its an amazing movie....worth the watch...Its one that leaves you feeling good...the little girl is just precious...James Denton who plays the police officer she cons into letting her work for him does an amazing job playing the aloof police officer with no responsibilities until he meets Miss Polka Dot.  His life changes for the better but most importantly Polka Dot receives the hope she needed.,1468627200,,789,4.64748201438849
