7867374,1,6304304188,"First off, I love Star Wars....but...This DVD is so awful!

The animation is terrible and the storylines are so completely boring and pathetic.  Don't buy this DVD unless you enjoy ANYTHING Star Wars and have a very, very, very low IQ.  I'm sure maybe then you won't mind it in that case. The Clone Wars Vol. 1 series is the only animated Star Wars DVD I've seen that respects the material and the characters in.

My personal version of hell would be getting tied to a chair and being forced to watch this DVD on repeat!",1113264000,,520,4.385416666666667
7867375,4,6304304188,"I enjoyed seeing these animated adventures the first time, when they ran in 1985-86, but seeing them again was wonderful, too.  An imaginative way of exploring the ""Star Wars"" universe through the eyes of new characters and villians.",1062374400,3,233,5.131578947368421
7867376,3,6304304188,Droids was good but the plot is to melo! I think this film should have been more action packed like that ewok one. But the droids make it worth while for me. But two main low points the really scary scene when the  droids are in trouble. The other is the uneccissary use of foul language  throughout the film. Otherwise its not bad.,958521600,,332,4.253968253968254
