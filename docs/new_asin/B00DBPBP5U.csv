5787620,4,B00DBPBP5U,"Thank you Amazon for making this series available. Now, if only you could talk Animal Planet into producing more seasons of The Haunted, I would know you are miracle workers!
I enjoy the series because as most pet owners know, our pets sense our world differently than we do. In some cases their perceptions are superior to ours, humans just have to re-member  and respect those perceptions...become more aware.",1348272000,4,411,4.956521739130435
5787621,3,B00DBPBP5U,"I've always been a fan of real-life paranormal stories, and one of my favorite shows is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Haunting-Seasons-1-4/dp/B001BCUB46/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Haunting - Seasons 1-4</a>&nbsp;which takes real-life supernatural experiences and dramatizes them. The stories are featured in a docu-drama format and the effects are quite chilling.

When I saw this show on television (I believe it is being screened on The Animal Planet channel), I thought I'd see how it compares to A Haunting. The format is different - most of the show focuses on interviews with people who have had close encounters and experiences with the paranormal, such as the family who moves into a New Orleans home, only to discover it is haunted. The interviews take up most of the show, weaving back and forth between the various family members who have experienced these close encounters, and also friends of the family. Family photographs and actual footage of the places are shown, as well as video footage where applicable, such as video footage of paranormal investigators going through a home or building.

There is also some dramatization involved, but not much. At times, the going back and forth between the various people being interviewed becomes rather annoying, and I felt the story itself moved very slowly as a result, and the storytelling seemed choppy. I prefer the format of A Haunting which focuses on dramatization, and feels more like a movie with creepy effects, as I think this format results in a more scary viewing experience. This show is recommended if you like hearing first-hand stories of people's encounters with the paranormal and how they dealt with such experiences.",1324944000,3,1745,5.483271375464684

This particular 'brand'- meaning that now the show is on a different channel. They simply aren't as scary as when the show was on Discovery Channel.

5787632,5,B00DBPBP5U,"Ghosts and evil spirits.  I appreciate the stories that show what can happen if you mess with stuff you don't understand.  Much like A Haunting, Paranormal Witness, and Haunted Amish, one should not mess with stuff they don't understand.  Or as I like to fondly call them idiots.  Don't get me wrong I am a part of the alternative religion scene and will not put down my beliefs here for big brother to track.  But even though I believe in most of the stuff in these episodes and really appreciate the story telling.  Nothing would ever get me to handle a spirit board or mess with anything that John Zaffis or the Warrens have encountered.  If you don't understand and it's evil don't poke it with a stick.  Even if you think you really understand it and can handle it.  I would point you in the direction of John Dee he as the court magician for Elizabeth the first.  He contacted the other side and he didn't go on a magic carpet ride.  Really these are just my opinions and come from a world view informed by watching these types of shows, devouring a lot of books, and having my own experiences that just happened.

I highly recommend if the subject matter interests you.",1389657600,,358,4.523076923076923

5787654,5,B00DBPBP5U,"Some of the things that happen to these people are terrifying, and I would hate to be in their shoes when that was happening, I love a good ghost show that's real and actually have happened to people, it opens your eyes to what's really going on around us but we just haven't noticed, I sometimes prefer the storytelling instead of the idiots going around with a camera and running at every little sound that's made (which half of the noises are made by them stomping about) the storytelling is just easier to follow, but don't get me wrong I like to hear the EVP's and things of what the ghosts say and they have that on this show, the people who are being haunted call in experts so you see some camera action and get to hear things on the recorder, but all in all if you enjoy paranormal shows but get dizzy with all the camera movement, this is your show, I just hope they come out with season 3 soon...",1388361600,,907,4.2485549132947975

5787659,5,B00DBPBP5U,"According to theory, children and animals are more sensative to ""unconventional"" events than those of us who have grown up entrenched in more accepted believes. this does not make us anymore ""right"" then they, just more closeminded.these are stories which are for those who perhaps wish to be more open to possiblities.",1384214400,,319,5.153846153846154
5787660,4,B00DBPBP5U,"I liked this show on the paranormal better than many others because the dramatics weren't as prevalent.  With so many of the other ghost hunter shows, when something paranormal happens the whole crew goes into ""oh my gosh did you see (or hear) that!"" and the camera goes all over the place making it impossible to see what all the excitement is about then they ask you to believe that what they are telling you happened, actually did.  This show offer's expert information without the over the top dramatics.  It offers many actual recordings of paranormal activity and doesn't make you rely on someones account of the event, although in some cases I did feel that was lacking on this show as well.",1381708800,,698,4.658536585365853
5787661,5,B00DBPBP5U,Awesome season and kept me entertained!  Story formatting and the way the episodes are shown kept me engrossed from Start to finish.,1381190400,,132,5.0
5787662,4,B00DBPBP5U,"Just for the record, in Season 2 Episode 1 ""The Demonic Seduction"" (LOLWTF?), the guy with the horrible facial hair claims to hear screaming in the backyard, and records it whilst flipping the f*** out, but I can tell you with the utmost certainty that he is hearing a fisher cat. They are quite common up here (I live in Connecticut) and they sound exactly like a woman screaming in pain. I don't know how someone that has lived in New England all his life (and Animal Planet) missed that one.

But I digress..

Most of these stories are about paranoid people and other people feeding off of said paranoia. How is a dog barking at a wall 'evidence' of the paranormal? Or a photograph of your breath in the cold an 'apparition'? All of these hokey paranormal groups and their so-called 'scientific' evidence is quite humorous to me. Of all the footage shown, they have not once provided any quantifiable evidence: just hillbillies screaming at shadows and agreeing too eagerly with their teammates' 'experiences'. There are no checks and balances in this world of half-assed paranormal study, and absolutely no science involved. Taking pictures and claiming that someone touched you does not a scientist make.

This is just a fun show full of people to laugh at and cute animals to watch. It is pretty entertaining if you take it at face value. I LOVE debunking this show (Which is probably why I watch any 'haunting' show.) The strange part is that I'm a believer, but I still can't believe a second of this. It's better to dissect all 'evidence', because you are then left with actual proof. One simply can believe everything you hear or see, but one can be entertained thoroughly by the tales of spineless rednecks.",1378857600,3,1718,4.72

5787666,1,B00DBPBP5U,"An absolutely UNbelievable episode... first, how did this obviously under-educated and very common family end up in a $2 million dollar New Orleans mansion?  Secondly, it takes a lot of money to ""gut"" a house and rebuild it from the floor joists up...  and even with a million dollar life insurance policy on the dead husband, that was probably a $3+ million dollar project.  Also, these are historical homes, and permits are required to do any updated renovations or changes, as well as permission from the historical society, on the houses in the New Orleans area...  I was totally digging the show, until this episode came up.  The red-neck son and crackhead-looking daughter just blew it for me.  I'd give this one 1.5 stars.",1373587200,,729,4.838709677419355

Thirty minutes of I've seen this before on another channel with a sprinkle of ""My dog started barking at shadows"" or ""my cat was so scared he couldn't poop in his box"".  Well, maybe he should pooped on the script....it might have had more flavor.  Stick to the animals....no, seriously; stay to what you know and quit trying to compete with the other channels in an area that is not your arena.
