4314192,4,B004B93RFQ,"Short Review: Overall this documentary is very well done, because its just an hour long it feels just about right. We get to see some great highlights from his career and get an insight into the life of a Giant. Though his size may have gotten him through the door and a run in WCW, he has a lot of talent that isn't because of his size. Big Show can play the big bad monster as well as being the funny gentle giant. I enjoyed watching this video and seeing his greatest moments but learning a little more about him, people compare him to Andre the Giant but he is very different to him and that is because of his personality.",1305590400,,626,4.181818181818182
4314193,5,B004B93RFQ,"yep! only rvd and rey mysterio's out do this one.it didn't have a book.so i had to randomly try discs until i get it right.i ended up writing my own book.this dvd ranks high on my list because its full of really good matches.ones ive seen and like i mean.the undertaker and shawn michaels videos were sorely lacking in that area.
  dvd 1-big show's life story.sometimes funny,sometimes touching,very interesting.after the story is a bunch of backstage stuff which is really funny.he's really good at impersonations in case you didn't know.then there was some feats of strength.you've got to see em to belive em!
  one thing that made me mad though was after show had given all these heart felt compliments out to all the other wrestlers,triple h talks all kinds of trash on the show.he makes fun of his size,calls him fat,makes light of his diabetes,and worse.he tells story after story about times he's purposely sat and made big show mad just for something to do on a plane ride.he tells stories where big show falls and is hurt or breaks a chair and thinks
its hysterical.its a good thing he's a gentle giant and not a mental giant or he'd put triple h's $$%^&^&*( in a sling and then cook up a comedy routine about that.
  dvd 2...vs hulk hogan[monster truck sumo match][6 stars].pretty good if you're into monster trucks.
  vs hulk hogan[title match][6 stars].this is the famous story of him being champion on his first night in wrestling.
  vs ric flair[title match] 6 stars
  vs sting[title match]  7 stars[awesome!]
  vs lex lugar[title match]5 stars[very average]
  vs stone cold[guest referee:mankind]6 stars
  vs undertaker[title match].this one has a really crazy ending![7 stars]
  vs rock vs triple h[no dq triple threat]-7 stars
  vs kurt angle[big show is dressed as hulk hogan] 6 stars
  vs brock lesnar[title match].unbelivable power by brock!6 stars
  vs rey mysterio jr[6 stars].show uses rey as a club while he is strapped to a stretcher! the ball?the steel ring post!
  vs eddie guierro[us title match. 7 stars.i didn't expect much from this match but eddie pulled every dirty trick he could.it was very entertaining! plus the ref gets crushed badly!
  vs lumber jacks[8 stars-CLASSIC].big show comes to the ring during a lumberjack match and takes on all 14 of them by himself!
  vs kurt angle[6 stars].there was just no following that last one up! they are probably in chronological order
  dvd 3....................
  with kane vs lance cade and trevor murdock[tag team title match]-6 stars.he's being held back! this guy shouldnt even be in tag team matches because he should be the unstoppable champion ever since the 90's.
  vs triple h[6 stars].show has a giant cast on his broken hand but fights anyway.
  vs rob van dam[new ecw extreme rules match]-[7 stars].rvd can make anyone look better.
  vs sabu[ new ecw extreme rules match]-7 stars.also a great one.
  WHEN I  SAY ""NEW ECW"" I MEAN THE WWE RUN ECW NOT THE WRESTLERS EDEN RUN BY PAUL HEYMEN,THE REAL ECW.
  vs floyd money mayweather[weigh in].5 stars.pretty normal but ends in a fight,as always.
  vs floyd money mayweather[no dq match].[6 stars]this was the one from wrestlemania.i was afraid it wouldnt be on here because this dvd sets are allergic to having high profile matches on them.but it was!
  vs kofi kingston.[5 stars].when kofi came out rvd had been underground for some time.i thought maybe kofi had been trained by rvd. because he's an awesome flier and an awesome kicker too.i used to call him the ""black van dam""
  vs rey mysterio jr [ic title match] 6 stars].
  with chris jericho vs dave batista and rey mysterio jr[6 stars].
  vs miz vs triple h and hbk vs cm punk and luke gallows[triple threat elimination].5 stars.an average match that could have been far better.
  normaly in the wwe they have a triple threat match which is different than a 3 way dance.in a triple threat match whoever gets the first pinfall or submission wins.the ecw had the 3 way dance.in it ,whenever someone loses,they leave and everybody else continues.this is called a triple threat ""elimination"" match which actualy makes it a 3 way dance.
  vs cm punk/luke gallows/ and joey mercury[3 on 1 handi cap match]5 stars.
  i have to say this dvd set got above average and stayed there.i have 5 of these dvd sets.it is better than the undertaker dvd set by some.it is waaaay better than the shawn michaels video in which they basicly took everything special he ever did and made sure it wasn't included.
  i would rank it behind the rey mysterio set because i like dazzling,mind blowing ,high fliers more than  the crusher style.
  i would definately rank it behind the rvd set because that one gave me everything i wanted and more.
  another thing i didn't like about the non-giant sets was how they left out a lot of stuff people remember them for.this one had only a few exeptions.
  1-when lex lugar racked him

  2-when kevin nash power bombed him
  3-when he won the 2000 royal rumble although rock is still credited with it to this day.
  4-the end of the 2004 royal rumble where he held his own against the 5 man team of kurt angle,chris benoit,john cena,rob van dam and chris jericho
  5-the sumo match vs ahkee bono
  6-that time he made a microphone disappear in his hand

  and thats really about it.so theres a huge amount of good stuff on this dvd set.i'd say go ahead and buy it.it's great fun.",1302307200,,5390,4.771490750816104
4314194,5,B004B93RFQ,I really enjoyed this dvd. The documentary was very well described and down to the point. The match selections were ok. Almost all of his matches he wins in which is a good thing. They put all of his world title wins and most of his great matches. This dvd is well worth getting.,1301529600,,279,4.185185185185185
4314195,3,B004B93RFQ,"He came into the wrestling business being put in the same spotlight as Andre The Giant & for over the next 15 years, he's definitely been one of the most dominate giants in the history of the business.  From being ""Andre's son"" to the ""World's Largest Athlete"", the story of Paul Wight is finally being told.  Throughout the documentary, you'll hear from his various family & friends along with fellow WWE talents such as William Regal, Triple H, Arn Anderson, Chavo Guerrero, Edge, John Cena, Pat Patterson.

The documentary begins with the story of how he was a small town boy (complete with footage from when he was a kid) to have health problems early & a heavy eating habit.  How he played basketball with that ending up getting him suspended for 6 months is talked about before going into the story behind the issues with a tumor that caused his overgrowth & stories behind the job he had before going into wrestling.  The documentary continues talking about how he was discovered by Hulk Hogan & trained at the WCW Power Plant with Triple H & William Regal commenting on his experiences there before going into how he got the spot that he did resulting in winning the World Championship in his very first match.  His ability to be very athletic for his size as far as speed, coming off the top rope, and doing moves likes dropkicks were heavily discussed before going into the problems he had in WCW with Triple H having his own theory of what went wrong there.  The story behind Show's WWE debut at the St. Valentine's Day Massacre PPV was talked about next before going into how he was miserable in his early WWE career before talking about how certain veterans like Undertaker helped mentor him.  A big highlight of the documentary happened next as the real life story behind the storyline with Big Boss Man in regards to his father's death was heavily discussed including why they had to take a more comedic approach as the storyline went along as opposed to keeping it serious.  His first WWE Championship win, the concept behind his entertaining impressions, and his reasoning behind his time in the OVW developmental territory are discussed before talking about his dominance in the ring with such highlights as when him & Brock Lesnar broke the ring.  We get a tour of his personal traveling bus along with the story behind why he got it & what he brought to the ECW brand was discussed before going into his new training methods that helped him lose weight & stay healthy with the feud with Floyd Mayweather (including getting his nose broken) & his acting roles (Knucklead, Waterboy, SNL) finish out the documentary.

Matches Include:
Sumo Monster Truck Match vs. Hulk Hogan - What they did here was have Hogan & Giant's customized monster trucks welded together & they had a sumo-type match over on Cobo Hall with the winner being able to push the losers truck out of the circle. It really wasn't much to watch unless your a huge fan of monster trucks but Hogan ended winning before getting into a confrontation with Giant leading to him falling off the roof of the building.
WCW Halloween Havoc '95

vs. WCW Champion Hulk Hogan - This match was the stereotypical formula you've seen from Hogan vs. ""Giant/Big Man"" matches in the past with the likes of Earthquake, King Kong Bundy, Big John Studd, ect. Hogan would get beat down & worn down with getting in a few short-lived comebacks here & there before finally Hulking Up, beginning to overpower, and eventually slam Giant. Right here is where all hell breaks loose as you find out that Jimmy Hart & Lex Luger were members of the Dungeon Of Doom by attacking Hogan & Randy Savage along with the appearance of the Yeti (which was short lived) before Giant walked out with the World Title.
WCW Halloween Havoc '95

vs. WCW Champion Ric Flair - This was pretty short & sweet as Flair tried his best but the future ""Big Show"" dominated this match & broke the figure four as only he can to win the WCW Championship.
""WCW Nitro"" Apr. '96
[Rise & Fall Of WCW]

WCW Championship Match vs. Sting - The prematch stipulation is that Jimmy Hart, Giant's manager, would be handcuffed to Lex Luger, ex-Dungeon Of Doom member & Sting's partner, to prevent interference.  Sting tried to hit & move early before eventually getting caught with Giant working over Sting's midsection by just standing on his stomach while later applying a body scissors & using the ropes to his advantage.  Luger & Hart were able to stay out of the action in the beginning but they would get more involved as the match went on such as Giant attempting to chokeslam Sting though a table the same way he did to Luger on the previous Nitro but Luger was able to use Jimmy Hart to prevent it along with playing a major factor in the end that helped Giant retain his WCW Championship.
WCW Slamboree '96

WCW Championship Match vs. Lex Luger - Luger was coming into this match looking to become a triple crown champion as he was already half of the WCW Tag Team Champions while also the WCW Television Champion.  Jimmy Hart tried getting involved early on but Sting appeared to chase Hart off making sure it was an even contest.  Giant focused on Luger's back by constantly tossing Luger onto his back while applying moves like the back breaker & bear hug.  This heavily effected Luger's power advantage as he wasn't able to slam Giant at one point while he was able to put Giant into his Torture Rack but unable to hold him helping Giant retain his title.
WCW Great American Bash '96

vs. Steve Austin - This was right before WrestleMania XV with Mankind as the special referee, The Rock doing commentary, and Vince sitting at ringside.  Show had the clear power advantage as he was able to keep counter Austin's attacks & block the stunner numerous times with Show also being was very defiant of Mankind causing him to take matters into his own hands at times as the referee.  This match really put Show over as a threat since he had to take numerous non-stop chair shots to the head to finally be put down.
""RAW"" Mar. '99

vs. WWE Champion Undertaker - This match which was a complete brawl from start to finish with the referee letting them get away than what they normally would such as Taker using a chair. However what this match is remembered for more than anything else is Big Show chokeslaming Undertaker through the ring.
""RAW"" July '99
[""Best Of RAW: Volume 2"" & ""Undertaker's Deadliest Matches""]

vs. WWE Champion Triple H vs. The Rock - This was originally suppose to be Steve Austin but with him getting ran over earlier in the show, Big Show walked in as his replacement.  Show was a dominate monster throughout the contest causing Triple H & Rock to get on the same page by constantly teaming up to take out Big Show whenever possible.  This match went all over the place from the ring to the floor back to the staging area with anything being used that they could get their hands on (ring bell, fire extinguisher, announce table).  Shane McMahon tried to be a guest referee to no avail before Vince McMahon would end up ""screwing"" someone out the WWE Championship in favor of Show.
Survivor Series '99

vs. Kurt Angle - This was pretty short & sweet as it was around the time that Big Show was being very entertaining during his matches by doing impressions of other wrestlers & famous people but this was probably he most memorable one he ever did...BROTHER!
Backlash '00

vs. WWE Champion Brock Lesnar - This was a match that was more about getting a storyline over than having an actual match. Brock had a broken rib so he was limited in what he could do but in 4 mins., he did an F-5 to Big Show, had Heyman turn his back on him (which was being set up for weeks) & have Show cheat him out of the WWE Title.
Survivor Series '02

vs. Rey Mysterio - ""David vs. Goliath"" here as Mysterio kept embarrassing Show for weeks leading up to this match here.  Rey tried to hit & run but Show kept eventually catching him & dominate.  Rey used a chair at one point & delivered 3 619's to Show only to once again get caught for Show to get the win & punish Rey for everything that happened after the match.
Backlash '03

vs. WWE United States Champion Eddie Guerrero - This match played to Eddie's weakness as he was selling the beating Show gave him on SmackDown so it was mostly a ""David vs. Goliath"" type match with Show dominating for the most part until it was just too much for Eddie as Show won the U.S. Title. Check out the part in the end when he tried to put the belt on his wait to realize it's too small.
No Mercy '03

vs. Kurt Angle - Show was revenge after he was ""raped of his dignity"" (tribute to Andre The Giant) by Kurt Angle to the point where he made it made it clear that he was going to ""break Angle in half.""  Show slowly punished Angle to the point where Kurt tried to take the easy way out of the match before being forced to continue.  Angle tried to resort to dirty tactics like a chair (which Show punched into Angle's face) & the tranquilizer gun which only made Show more angry to the point where Angle payed for it with a very powerful chokeslam from the top rope.  This was probably the most dominate performance from Big Show throughout his entire career.
No Mercy '04

w/Kane vs. World Tag Team Champions Lance Cade & Trevor Murdock - Kane & Big Show got the title shot here because they didn't win the vote to participate in the WWE Championship match later that night (explain that logic).  While Cade & Murdock were able to get some shots in & work over Kane for a short time, this was a dominate performance by Show & Kane from start to finish & even after the match.
Taboo Tuesday '05

vs. Triple H - Triple H had injured Big Show's hand weeks before the match causing it to be put in a cast...only for Show to reveal the next week that all Triple H did was give him an extra weapon to use.  Show dominated Triple H early before he missed a punch into the pole causing the cast to split enabling Triple H to eventually remove it.  Triple H worked over that hand using the steel steps & a chair while Show was in pain to the point where he couldn't use the chokeslam but still fought through & even broke Triple H's sledgehammer in half with his bad hand.  This was a good match that revolved around the story of Big Show's bad hand.
New Year's Revolution '06

Extreme Rules Match vs. ECW Champion Rob Van Dam - After RVD lost his WWE Championship the previous night on RAW, he accepted Big Show's challenge against the wishes of Paul Heyman.  They started out in the ring but eventually worked through the crowd at ringside with Show only beating down RVD including one moment where he caught RVD coming off the top rope & just easily tossed him out.  RVD was able to gain some momentum & used the ""Extreme Rules"" to his advantage by countering Show's attempt to use the steel steps causing Show's head to bounce off them.  However Paul Heyman would be the determining factor in this match the same way he was weeks earlier at the One Night Stand PPV except in this case, RVD's title reign when ""Up In Smoke"" as he lost the title to the Big Show in what was dubbed ""The South Philly Screwjob.""
""ECW on Sci-Fi"" July '06
[ECW: Extreme Rules]

ECW Championship/Extreme Rules Match vs. Sabu - In a nutshell, I just saw this as Sabu being a spot money for Big Show to dominate. The match wasn't smooth as Sabu is also so fast paced & trying to be innovative that his spots look sloppy at times plus some of the props like the tables were having some problems as well. Just again, Sabu was a body for Show to dominate over.
SummerSlam '06

vs. Floyd Mayweather - Well this was the best ""worked"" boxing influenced match I've seen in wrestling but considering how crappy the other ones were, that's not much of a compliment. The match was entertaining for what it was once they got away from trying to make it a look like a real ""shoot"" match & started getting entertaining with Mayweather's crew getting involved at times with chairs & brass knucks coming into play. Too bad they didn't book Mayweather as the heel in this feud, as he is just a natural in that role, because I got a guilty pleasure out of Big Show chopping & just manhandling him at times. In the end, this match was like the Billionaires match last year where it was about the the hype of the celebrity appearance to draw money instead of having a high quality match so with that in consideration, this was an entertaining match for what it was...and at least he didn't have to see Big Show in a diaper unlike his celebrity match at WrestleMania 21.
WrestleMania XXIV

vs. Kofi Kingston - Although Kofi was able to get some offense with his vast array of kicks, this was a squash match for Big Show to kept swatting Kofi down & even knocked him out while he was in mid-air.
""SmackDown"" Apr. '09

vs. Rey Mysterio - Just another squash match for Big Show as he just manhandled him & even was able to measure his knockout punch to where Rey knew it was coming but there wasn't anything he could do about it.
""RAW"" Apr. '09

Unified Tag Team Championship Match w/Chris Jericho vs. Batista & Rey Mysterio - Eventhough it was heavily put over that Mysterio & Batista were former WWE Tag Team Champions, the little known fact is that they were only champions for a week & have teamed up together so many times that you can count them on one hand & hadn't teamed together in years. Knowing that fact, this match was the shock of the night because Batista & Mysterio worked really well together here as they did great teamwork & kept Jericho away from Big Show various times in the match and working him over. Watch out for the kick Mysterio gave Jericho at one point that looked like it was out Tajiri's old playbook and just how massive Show is to Mysterio as he palmed his head on the outside & lifted him into the ring. This played match played out well as it worked towards everyone's strengths & there wasn't a dull moment. Definitely the best performance in both of these teams history.
Hell In A Cell '09
[Best PPV Matches Of 2009-2010 (Blu-Ray Edition)]

w/The Miz vs. Unified Tag Team Champions D-Generation X vs. C.M. Punk & Luke Gallous - This was under the format of the original ECW's ""3 way dance"" where instead of the first team to score the victory wins, this was elimination style with the last team standing becoming the Unified Tag Team Champions.  This was a match that went back & forth between all three times & continued on once Punk & Gallous were eliminated.  Eventhough the result of the match was ShowMiz becoming the Tag Team Champions, the bigger picture here was the issues with Shawn Michaels in regards to his frustration over not only his issue with Undertaker but also Triple H.
""RAW"" Feb. '10

vs. Straight Edge Society (C.M. Punk, Luke Gallous, Joey Mercury) - Before I get started, old school wrestling fans will get a chuckle out of the Greg Valentine reference Matt Striker pointed out in regards to Punk's t-shirt. This was a 3 on 1 handicap match with the twist on the rules being that it was tornado tag rules so all the members of the S.E.S. were allowed in the ring at the same time. In a nutshell, this was a dominate performance by Big Show as he showed that his injured hand was healed and easily took care of Gallous & Mercury in the beginning before he reinjured his hand missing a chop on Punk & hitting the ringside steps. S.E.S. was able to work over Show for a small time but Show was able to still recover & dominate his way to a victory with possibly the biggest story being where Punk was with Serena when Gallous & Mercury were at the mercy of Show.
SummerSlam '10

DVD extras include bonus stories from Show in regards to what happened when he met his wife's parents, his reaction to the name ""The Big Show"", a moment he had with The Rock on a plane, the story of what happened backstage when he impersonated The Godfather, talking about his lifestyle change, how he got his cousin a role in the Knucklehead movie, doing a word association with talents he worked with, and Triple H telling various funny memories he's had of Show.  Other DVD extras include past footage such as the time he pushed a dumpster on top of Big Boss Man & Prince Albert, the funeral he had for his late father, Show showing off his entertaining side for the first time, destroying Torrie Wilson's car, pushing over a jeep, his return to SmackDown in Oct. 2004, and the weigh-in with Floyd Mayweather from RAW.

In the end, the documentary only last around an hour which I found very disappointing as they didn't cover most of his major feuds & moments throughout his career (we have time to see his bus but nothing on his feuds with Brock Lesnar & Undertaker that repackaged his career?).  As for the match selection, again so many significant matches from his career were left out here as well.  With the documentary only going an hour & extras around half an hour, they had more room to use to add additional matches such as his stretcher match against against Brock or the actual match where they broke the ring, the tag team Buried Alive match with Taker vs. Rock & Mankind that for some reason WWE refuses to release to this day, one of his many matches against Undertaker (No Mercy '08 where he knocked Taker out or No Way Out 03), the ""Battle of the Giants"" vs. Great Khali at Backlash '08 (before you freak out, just watch it as Khali actually had to wrestle in that match & both men did well), the Singapore Cane match from One Night Stand 08, Steel Cage match vs. JBL, Last Man Standing vs. Shane McMahon, The Rock at No Way Out '00...all of these to pick from not even tapping into his WCW matches he's had past 1996.  I enjoyed it overall but was disappointed about how much they left out in favor of what they left in (did we really need the Kofi & Mysterio squashes?) but I'll give WWE credit in that we didn't give us a heavy load of repeats from other sets it's something I would recommend overall.",1300147200,5,17979,4.449209245742092
4314196,5,B004B93RFQ,"I have bought many wrestler specific dvd's over the years, most I have rated three stars or less, this is a five star dvd no doubt about it. Most of the time when I buy a dvd about one of my farvorite wrestlers the match selection is terrible because which ever wrestler it may be the Undertaker for example wins about half of the matches on the dvd. Another negative about wrestler dvd's is too many of the matches are of little or no importance. The Big Show A Giants World does not have these problems, as this dvd has the best match selection I have ever seen, and The Big Show actually wins most of the matches (18-3-1). The matches on this dvd are also some of the most important of The Big Show's career these include, 5 world title wins, 2 world tag team title wins, 1 united states title win, and some successful title defences. If your a Big Show fan this is must have dvd. If I could I give it ten stars.",1299801600,8,915,4.175141242937853
4314197,4,B004B93RFQ,"This 3 disc set turned out much better than I had anticipated. The lack of the WCW matces really do suck. The documentary portion was nicely done, however, the lack of depth with inside stories of rivarlies/matches was disappointing as well. Even though it did lack WCW matches I was pleased somewhat with the matches on hand since it had the likes of HHH, The Rock, Stone Cold Steve Austin, RVD, etc...overall not bad but could've been much better...",1299024000,,451,4.7215189873417724
4314198,4,B004B93RFQ,"When I heard that WWE was releasing a Big Show DVD I was very skeptical at first, but after further review I am pleased to say that this was put together very nicely.  For the most part the match selection was done well but I would have preferred to see more matches from WCW.  A lot of the matches were enertaining and had a pretty good pace to them.  I was expecting to see a lot of slow paced action but I forgot how well the Big Show could work.  The only complaint I really have for this 3 disc set is the fact that the bio was only an hour long!  It was a good watch and I learned a lot about Paul White, but they should have extended the bio to atleast 2 hours.  They lightly skimmed over his days in WCW which really hurt this DVD.  Disc 1 features some good special features which somewhat make up for the lack of bio.  All in all I would recommend this DVD to any wrestling fan.",1298678400,3,888,3.977401129943503
4314199,3,B004B93RFQ,"I liked this dvd, a biography of the big show, however i think they should have spent more time on his wcw matches and his time in that organization.  A little to much time was spent on promoting the knucklehead movie, which was not why i viewed this dvd, i could really care less about that.  So that bring a 60 minute biography on the big show down to about 50 minutes, it goes down to about 40 minutes if you don't really care about the floyd mayweather match.  This dvd could have been alot better.  Rent this one instead of buying it.",1298592000,,539,4.203883495145631

4314201,2,B004B93RFQ,"This dvd is a disappointment. I'm not a huge fan of The Big Show, but I enjoy the quality of the biography features that the wwe puts out. This dvd lowers the quality a tad. The biography is barely passable and is far too short. It only lasts about 58 minutes. Most clock in 1:40 to 2 hours. They only spend about 10 minutes on Big Show's WCW run, skipping over a lot of his feuds. They spend too much time talking about Knucklehead. They also skip over a lot of Big Show's feuds in the WWE focusing way too much time on the Show/mayweather feud. Some of the matches on the dvd are good. They serve, mainly, as a nostalgic glimpse into the past. The later matches aren't as good. I hope this is not a new trend in wwe dvds.",1297987200,7,723,4.098591549295775
8421670,5,B004B93RFQ,"Great DVD set on the Giant. As a WCW fan I wish there would've been more matches from those days. All WCW matches are from 1995 and 1996 there is no NWO material on this DVD set. But this is one of the better WWE profile DVD sets. The Giant, Paul Wight, is involved with and has many great interviews here on the DVD set. The Giant is by far, hands down, the best Big Man that has ever wrestled. The only other big man who even compares to him is Andre the Giant, and Andre only because he was the first real big man. Paul Wight has more agility and personality than all others for his size, and he has personally immortalized the Choke Slam. I loved The Giant as a kid, and I rolled with the Big Show as a teen, so as long as Paul Wight is in the ring he will be the greatest Big Man to wrestle in my opinion. This DVD set has about 23 matches and tons of bonus and personal interviews. I had no idea Big Show And Floyd Mayweather had fought at Wrestlemania 24 in 2008. The Big Show slimmed down in boxing shape is so cool. All the Big Show material after maybe 2002 was new to me. I paid about 12 $$ and its well worth it for this DVD set on a Legend.",1516838400,,1153,3.9106382978723406

I watched the first 2 disks so far, and I must say this is good WWE DVD and a the first WWE dvd I have purchased in in a few years. I enjoyed how they told Show's story from WCW transitioning into WWF and how he had a few setbacks and the early years of his life. I did enjoy watching some of the matches during his time in WCW I found it kind of crazy how he rises to the top so fast against guys like Hulk Hogan & Ric Flair. I think the match selection on here perfectly chronicles Big Show's career from past to the present good job on the match selections WWE.",1318032000,,652,3.837037037037037
8421679,4,B004B93RFQ,"He's the largest athlete in sports entertainment, a multi-time champion, an TV star and this is a 3-Disc set highlighting Paul Wight's life growning up and what's happened during his time inside and outside the ring.

We see how he grew up in a small town and how from an early age he started to get bigger and stronger than other children around him, even at one point he broke a backboard at a school while playing basketball, causing this school to suspend him. One of the best parts of the documentary was when they talked about the tumor in his brain that caused Giantism and how if he didn't have it removed then he would die. This removal led to him having to change how he ate and worked out and how things he found so easy before were a lot harder without the gland in his system. There's also him talking about how he was a car dealer before he realzied he needed a better job to get to a better place in life.

Enter pro wrestling where Hulk Hogan discovered him and his training at the WCW Power Plant caught the eye of guys like Triple H and William Regal who marveled at his size and shocking agility. This agility was shown in various clips of his WCW run, including hitting dropkicks from the top rope, also that in his first match on PPV he won the WCW Championship from Hulk Hogan. While he was large and impressive it seemed he was never really used properly, mainly due to backstage politics.

They showned his shocking debut at St. Valentine's Day Massacre was shown and he was also very open and honest about how he was not very happy in his early WWE days. Mainly cause since he was never allowed to develop in the ring in WCW so he didn't really know what it took to have a great match when he debuted in WWE. They discuss how his October/November rivalry with the Big Bossman brought closure to the death of Wight's dad a few years back, pretty touching stuff.

We hear how Stone Cold Steve Austin's injury at Survivor Series '99 led to Show being put into a Triple Threat with Rock and Triple H and that he won the WWE title, but he admitted he got lazy feeling he didn't need to try since he was on top. This led to him being booked as someone who impersonated various superstars and characters, which were funny but kinda sad too. Since he had gotten lazy he was sent to OVW and he talked about how that opened his eyes to how he needed to work and train harder.

He returned and had good rivalries with The Rock and namely Brock Lesnar, they even showed how they broke the ring on an episode of Smackdown. He discusses how traveling on the road is tough especially for his size, thus he bought a tour bus which made road life easier to endure. After he left in December of '06, he got more serious about his training and this led to a return and match against boxer Floyd Mayweather at Wrestlemania XXIV. We also hear about how he branched into action roles and his real life wife talks about how she knows he loves wrestling but would like to see him not be so hurt all the time.

Matches

-WCW Halloween Havoc '95, Sumo Monster Truck Match, vs. Hulk Hogan: Taking place on top of a building, each man had a monster truck and they were welded front to front, then tried to push each other out of the circle, which Hogan was able to do. This wasn't worth much of a watch, but the aftermath is good where they have a face/off that leads to Giant ""falling"" from the roof to the ground. 5/10.

-WCW Halloween Havoc '95, WCW Championship Match, vs. Hulk Hogan (Champion): If you've seen Hogan against big men before then you know what to expect as he sells to Giant to make him look unbeatable, while he hulks up and goes to even slam the Giant. The end was bedlam as Jimmy Hart and Lex Luger came down and sided with Kevin Sullivan's Dungeon of Doom, they beat up Hogan, then there was an appearance of the infamous Yeti. The Giant ends up leaving with the World Title without ever actually having won it. 6/10.

-WCW Monday Nitro, WCW Championship Match, vs. Ric Flair (Champion): Flair did his usual selling to make Giant seem unstoppable and also resorted to dirty tactics including using brass knuckles to knock the big man out. The Giant does break Ric's figure four, chokeslams him and makes the cover to win the world title. 6/10.

-WCW Slamboree '96, WCW Championship Match, vs. Sting: Sting tried some hit and run offense before Giant started working him over focusing on his ribs and back. During this match Jimmy Hart was handcuffed to Lex Luger so there would be no outside interference, but that also led to a controversial finish as Luger ended up hitting Sting on accident with Hart's megaphone. Giant made the cover and retained his title. 7/10.

-WCW Great American Bash '96, WCW Championship Match, vs. Lex Luger: Coming into this match Lex was looking to add to World title to his half of the tag team and his TV titles. Giant worked over Luger's back with backbreakers trying to take away any chance of the Torture Rack being used. However Lex does get the Rack applied but cant hold the Giant up so he makes the cover to retain his title. 6/10.

-Raw March '99, vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin: This was to hype the upcoming Austin/Rock and Show/Mankind matches at Wrestlemania XV, Rock was on commentary which added some funny elements to it. Show blocked a few Stunner attempts and Austin had to hit Show numerous times with a chair then hit the Stunner and made the cover to win. 6/10.

-Raw June '99, WWE Championship Match, vs. The Undertaker (Champion): Another quick contest that is a little better than the other match, namely for Show chokeslamming Taker through the ring and this ends in a no contest of sorts. 6/10. Great post match where Show destroys the Acolytes and Mideon.

-Survivor Series '99, Triple Threat Match for the WWE Championship, vs. Triple H (Champion) vs. The Rock: After Austin was injured earlier in the night, Show was the substitute and it was a good triple threat that really put over Show as dominate to the point that Rock & Triple H teamed up to take him down. Lots of weapons were used and the action went all over the arena, Vince McMahon ended up coming down and played referee allowing Show to pin Triple H to win the title. 8/10.

-Backlash '00, vs. Kurt Angle: Very quick match that saw Show impersonate someone the WWE knew very well ""brother"". Show hit some big moves and hit a leg drop to win the match. 5/10.

-Survivor Series '02, WWE Championship Match, vs. Brock Lesnar (Champion): Due to Brock having a broken rib this wasn't nearly long enough for a championship match. Lesnar did hit some impressive suplexes and even an F-5, but his manager Paul Heyman pulled the ref out before the 3 count. Show ended up hitting the chokeslam on the chair and made the cover to win the WWE title. 6/10.

-Backlash '03, vs. Rey Mysterio: We have another quick one here, Rey hits some good quick moves but eventually gets caught and receives a big chokeslam, Show makes the cover and wins. 5/10. The post match is more memorable as Rey is being stretchered out but Show comes back, picks up the stretcher and slams it into the ring post and drops Mysterio face first into the outside mat.

-No Mercy '03, WWE United States Championship Match, vs. Eddie Guerrero (Champion): Eddie had been beaten up by Show recently, so Guerrero wasn't 100%, Show worked him over and while Eddie tried he just couldn't stand up to the big monster. Show ends up hitting a big chokeslam to win the U.S. title. 6/10.

-Smackdown '04, The Return: We see the final minute of Eddie Guerrero vs. Kurt Angle with lumberjacks around the ring, the Big Show's music hit. He ran down to the ring and laid waste to everyone and I mean everyone in the ring with power moves and chokeslams. Great segment. 9/10.

-No Mercy '04, vs. Kurt Angle: After Angle knocked him out and shaved his head in the middle of the ring on Smackdown, Show was out to exact vengeance and boy did he ever. Angle did get in some moves but Show basically just tossed around Kurt and beat him down, even punching a chair into Angle's face at one point. Kurt got hit with a big chokeslam from the top rope and Show made the cover to win. 8/10.

-Taboo Tuesday '05, World Tag Team Championship Match, w/Kane vs. Lance Cade & Trevor Murdoch (Champions): After they didn't get voted into the WWE Championship match, Kane & Show got this title shot. It was a dominate performance by both men, though Kane did get worked over by Cade & Mrudoch for a bit. They ended up hitting dueling chokeslams and made the cover to win the tag titles. 7/10.

-New Year's Revolution '06, vs. Triple H: Show's hand was injured leading up to this match, he had to have a big cast put on it which turned out to be a weapon early on before Show missed a punch into the post and soon after Triple H broke the cast apart. Steel steps and a chair were used on the hand and Show couldn't even chokslam him. Triple H ended up hitting the pedigree after a hard fought match to make the cover and win. 7/10.

-ECW, July '06, Extreme Rules Match for the ECW Championship, vs. Rob Van Dam (Champion): This match went all over the place, Show just tossed RVD around the ring and the outside, later RVD countered when he tripped Show hitting the steel steps head first. Like at One Night Stand a month before, Paul Heyman came down to make the count but ended up screwing RVD. Show hits a chokeslam and makes the cover to become the new ECW champion. 8/10.

-Summerslam '06, Extreme Rules Match for the ECW Championship: Not very good here as a lot of the spots were botched and Sabu didn't get a lot of moves in. He was just someone used to put over Show without looking really good in the process. 4/10.

-Wrestlemania XXIV, The Biggest vs. The Best, vs. Floyd ""Money"" Mayweather: As far as worked boxer vs. wrestler matches this is the best one, which mind you isn't sayin much. This was about Show getting his hands on Floyd and beating him up while Floyd had to resort to having his posse interfere. He used a chair multiple times on Show and even used brass knuckles and Show couldn't answer the 10 count. 6/10.

-Smackdown April '09, vs. Kofi Kingston: More dominance from Show as Kofi hit a few good moves but Show ended up hitting his knockout punch on Kofi who was in mid air and he pinned him to win. 5/10.

-Raw April '09, vs. Rey Mysterio: Another one where he throws Rey around and even sets up and nails the knockout punch that Rey couldn't avoid. 5/10.

-Hell In A Cell '09, Unified Tag Team Championship Match, w/Chris Jericho (Champions) vs. Batista & Rey Mysterio: Pretty good one here that saw both teams work very well together, Jericho was isolated by Rey & Batista for a bit. Show just knocked Rey around the ring when they faced off and the champs almost went down before Show hit a big chokeslam on Rey and made the cover to retain the titles. 9/10.

-Raw Feb. '10, Triple Threat Elimation Match for the Unified Tag Team Championship, w/Miz vs. D-X (Champions) vs. CM Punk & Luke Gallows: Not a bad one here, but was more about Shawn Michaels' issues with Undertaker at their upcoming Wrestlemania match as he got distracted and rolled up by Miz so we have new tag team champions. 7/10.

-Summerslam '10, Handicap Match vs. The Straight Edge Society (CM Punk, Luke Gallows & Joey Mercury): This was a really great showing here as Show just beat up the 3 until he re-injured his hand after hitting some steel steps. Show didn't stay down long, as he again beat up all three men and Punk ended up leaving the ring with Serena while Mercury & Gallows got destroyed by Show as he won this match. 5/10.

The extras are good too and are funny for the most part. Loved the one where they showed his return in September of '04 where he just cleared the ring of everyone.

While the documentary is very short its nice to see some footage of his life outside the ring, the matches are good for the most part and there are a lot of repeats like other sets that WWE has released.",1315267200,6,11981,4.417044424297371
