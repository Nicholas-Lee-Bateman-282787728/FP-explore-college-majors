2423491,5,B000BLAK76,"I got this boxset series a few months back and I absolutely loved it.  The story is ingenious and it's different from your typical k-drama!  It's nice to watch a drama where the female lead isn't perfect in everyway, a little rough around the edges!

It's wonderful how the story develops and how everyone ends up in the end.  This is definitely one of those k-dramas that gets you hooked.",1140220800,13,389,4.514285714285714
2423492,5,B000BLAK76,"MNIKSS is really one of the best korean dramas out there.  it's almost as good as my two favorite korean drama Attic Cat and I'm Sorry, I Love You (MISA).

the plot is really great because you can guess whats going to happen but of course Kim Sam Soon twists it so that it comes out totally sincere and laughable.  the two main leads are really great actors altho Hyun Bin (Sam Shik) sometimes has a expressionless expression but that's rarely often.  while Kim Sun Ah (Sam Soon) is really great actress.  even the two supporting characters enhances rather than detracts from the two main characters.  Hyun Bin's absolutely one of the most attractive prince charming...best is when Sam Shik is in love with Sam Soon.

the music is great of course.  especially the song Inside My Heart and track 14 of the OST.  both of the songs leave you feeling meloncholy.

the drama got me wanting the stuffed piggy that Sam Shik seems to always mistreat and curious about Momo who is a quiet girl who listens well but it's actually a book written by Michael Ende.",1129593600,15,1051,4.542553191489362
2423493,5,B000BLAK76,"Scroll down to REVIEW for the review. Also, I am currently rewatching this drama for the fifth time.

This is the very first foreign & Korean drama I've ever seen (the second was Hana Yori Dango). I enjoyed it but it didn't mean anything to me until I was fed up with being bullied in school because I was the ""fat, ugly chick"" that everyone made fun of--even though I didn't do anything! Now I have some crazy self-confidence, you wouldn't even believe how much this drama changed me.

My sister laughs at me because this drama was life-changing for me! I wanted to be just like Sam Soon (personality & profession) but I became my own person in general and want to be the best in whatever I do. Alfred D'Souza's ""Happiness is a Journey, Not a Destination"" is my favorite poem and I plastered it to my wall and read it constantly. It's like the go to sappy poem but means the world to me. Sam Soon made me a whole new person and I've seen this drama over 3 times and finally purchased it.

I recommend it to everyone whether they have low self-esteem or not. Sam Soon is her own person and all she wanted to do was fall in love. I made my life about two things:

1. Succeed in my career.
2. Fall in love and get married.

She's a simple person and so am I!

REVIEW

My Lovely Sam Soon tells about the life of an unemployed pastry chef, Kim Sam Soon, who has gone through a terrible break up on Christmas. Six months later, she's still unemployed but looking but no one is willing to hire her. That's when she meets Hyun Jin Heon, the owner of Bon Appetit, a restaurant looking for a French pastry chef. Luckily, Sam Soon is French-trained and Korean so it's even better. However, their meeting is not so great but (of course) Sam Soon gets the job. When his mother keeps prying about Jin Heon getting married, he cooperates with Sam Soon (who is in need of cash) to play as a pretend couple. He claims they won't fall in love because she has a ""realistic perception of herself"" (AKA fat + ugly but not really because this is a TV show so she's slightly chubby and still pretty). So, this devolves into a story that revolves only around love with Sam Soon getting stuck in the middle of Jin Heon and his previous lover, Hee Jin (the girl with the name Sam Soon wants to change her name to). Hee Jin's doctor friend also gets mixed up in it when he follows her to Korea for her own personal reasons + he loves her.

So, the plot is amazing to me. Although it's not a really deep drama with backstabbing and corporate takeovers or murder, this drama sure does have its moments. It's not so heavy you're crying all the time; however, it does have its moments where you do well up and a tear (or two, three, twenty) will fall. However, it's generally light-hearted and, like most Asian dramas, SO CHEESY. I still love it.

The characters are all dynamic in their personalities. Sam Soon seems like the tough chick who can take it off but she's pretty soft on the inside--especially, her heart. In the case of Jin Heon, he seems like a cool, calculating type but he's definitely not. He really is as Sam Soon says, ""a boy until he becomes a father."" Sadly, Henry has very little personality in the beginning since he's just the general happy guy but he gets awesome as the series goes on. Hee Jin is actually surprising as a second female lead meant to steal the main male lead. She is not catty and sly like most second female leads in Korean dramas. This is very refreshing! Sadly, Henry as the second male lead is pointless since he NEVER pursues Sam Soon. Thus, he's more like a third male lead only after Hee Jin with Sam Soon's ex-boyfriend filling in as the male second lead. On cast lists, they wonk this up. They need to fix it. Also, secondary characters such as the chef, the sister of Sam Soon, the parents, Mi Joo and so on are great! This is a very lively drama that won't bore you. The acting is perfection on all parts (except Daniel Henney since he's a model getting into acting roles and this is his first major drama).

The progression of the drama is a little slow at times but that's every show. Sometimes, I skipped past parts with Hee Jin and Henry because it was just them repeating something she already spent part of the show thinking about or someone else brought up. Also, when I watch a drama, I tend to focus on the main couple more than other characters. However, I don't do this for all dramas. Sometimes, the second couple or other subplot is more interesting and I watch the show for that instead.

I have the Kim Sam Soon soundtrack because the music is really great and they mix it up so it's not the same old thing. Sometimes the camera work is kind of weird (in one scene there's a random and unnecessary zoom-in) and you see the boom mic/stick at the top of the screen but it's more funny than distracting.

I don't know what more there is to say. I love this drama and it does have it's bad bits, I admit. However, the bad is too small for me to see when it's so good.",1322611200,,5002,4.2926829268292686
2423494,5,B000BLAK76,"Hilarious and  entertaining.  The heroin, Sam Soon, is a hard-to-hate character and I am sure many women can identify w/ her.  It is one of my all time favorite (and I watched over 100s of k dramas)!",1321920000,,199,4.324324324324325

2423496,5,B000BLAK76,"I watched the show for free on [...] and I love the show so much I want to spend the $$ on the DVD.  I had watched one Korean drama before I watched this show.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE this show and the main characters.  I was hooked from the very first episode when she was crying her eyes out in the men's bathroom and met her true love there.  This show just made me laugh and get teary-eyed.  Even my husband was hooked and didn't want me to watch the show without him.

I have a question about the DVD.  I'm deaf myself and I was wondering if the English-speaking portions are also subtitled in English.  When I watched the show on [...], they only showed the Korean subtitles when people were speaking English.  I can't read Korean and I couldn't read their lips at all when they were speaking English.  Could someone answer my question?  Thanks!",1290816000,,845,4.284810126582278

2423498,4,B000BLAK76,"I finally got the chance to watch My Lovely Sam Soon this summer. Sam soon is a take-no-crap heroine (there's always one in most good kdramas) who found herself in the stickiest situations. It was a very funny show and it kept my interest till the end. While I did enjoy watching this program, I think its a rent rather than buy. Some characters connected really well and others -- it just seemed forced. 3.5 stars",1285545600,,414,4.4605263157894735

You will laugh at her antics, but also admire her determination and business savvy. There is nothing much I can say that hasn't been said in previous reviews, but I have to mention the really nice packaging by YAentertainment! It also contains a mouse pad as a bonus.

2423503,5,B000BLAK76,"Two words, kids .... Hyun Bin.

And not to take anything away from the terrific Korean actress, Kim Sun Ah, who portrays the title character in this beloved Korean perennial (and available on Netflix btw in case you just want to dip your toes in) because she is wonderful, from start to finish. But once you've invited Hyun Bin into your lifeboat, isn't the rest of the pitching and rolling voyage all about how to keep him hydrated and looking fresh?? HB is the undisputed poster boy of my as-yet unwritten series, ""The Compulsively Watchable Koreans."" I came to K-dramas late, but like all recent converts to religion, I am fanatic and prone to button-holing strangers in the street to sing the praises of Lee Jun Ki in ""Iljimae"" or Ji Sung in ""Save The Last Dance For Me."" If you haven't already discovered them, run don't walk to the nearest one. You'll be addicted in no time, just like me.",1264291200,5,895,4.559006211180124
2423504,5,B000BLAK76,"Funny how we're supposed to get a beauty-is-skin-deep message in a story where an ugly duckling prefers attractive men. But, somehow it usually works. Especially when the actress has the ability to draw the viewer into her character so that the viewer deeply empathizes. Talented Kim Seon Ah does.

She could have done it even if she hadn't put on an extra 15 pounds for this role of a 30-year-old looking for -- as her character Sam Soon charmingly put it -- someone to help row a small boat across the Pacific.

The other lead actors are not quite as good... and more conventionally attractive. The tall, boyish-looking lead actor Hyeon Bin just barely rises above his role's stereotype. However, he should at least be given a stuntman credit for the physical abuse he takes from the females thru out the series.

There's a fair amount of English in this one cuz Korean-American model-turned-actor Daniel Henney makes his dramatic debut as one of the minor leads -- and he hadn't mastered Korean yet. Consequently, the girl he follows to Korea was cast with an actress who had spent her teenage years in Australia -- the very pretty Jung Ryeo-won, former member of KPop girl group Chakra. Her English is much better than what is usually passed off as English in Korean shows. There's also a lot of English-language songs on the music track.

There are some soap opera clichs here. And it threatens to get tiresome when the pattern of boy-loses-girl boy-gets-girl repeats and repeats. The writers needed to show more imagination. And I found the ending a little less effective than it could have been. (I think the ending would have been powerful if the series ended at episode 15 instead of 16 -- making me wonder if that was the original intention.)

The ratings for the original airing of this show in South Korea were phenomenal -- averaging 40% of the viewers -- with the finale capturing over 50% of the viewers. It was the most watched show of 2005. And it became a hit all over Asia. I'm sure non-Asians will like it just as much.

BTW, ""Sam Soon"" is an old name rarely used nowadays -- that's why the woman spends the series resenting it.

BTW-2, that's Daniel Henney showing off his basketball skills -- he attended college on a basketball scholarship. And no doubt that's Kim Seon Ah playing the piano at the end -- she majored in piano at a US college. For that reason, I suspect her English is even better than the broken (but very understandable) English we hear in this show.

BTW-3, if you like this one, you might try one I liked even better --&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/COFFEE-PRINCE/dp/B000X5HE7Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">COFFEE PRINCE</a>&nbsp;which aired 2 years later. It shares a lot of common elements with this one -- but in that one, the girl is passing herself off as a guy.",1260921600,,2853,4.84394250513347
2423505,5,B000BLAK76,"Okay I'm 20 years old and a guy. I hate soap operas, I hate romantic comedies but there are some drama/comedy/romance series that I like. One of theme is the show Ugly Betty, I bought this series on a whim when I had some extra cash to spend after my friend told me about he told me if I liked Ugly Betty I would like this. he was wrong its much better than Ugly Betty, the series takes place in Korea revolves around a 30 year old woman named Kim Sam Soon. Sam-Soon does not have the greatest life she is unmarried at 30, a little over weight, hates her name(apparently Sam Soon is a very embarrasing name?), and just found out her boyfriend of three years is cheating on her. Not to spoil to much of the opening a series of events lead Sam Soon to getting a job as a pastry chef at a French restaurant working for the rude pretty boy 27 year old Hyun Jin Heon, needles to say the series starts off with them hating each other. Unlike other shows

My Lovely Sam Soon has only 16 episodes, that may not sound like much but because of its length the series is able to give a great story that wraps up nicely without out staying its welcome. Each character from the main to the side characters are well rounded and have a purpose in the series they don't just simply exist in the world they are apart of it. The overall look of the show is similar to a British show as it has that realistic look to it unlike the more cinematic American shows, the music is nothing amazing you will hear the same stuff over again but usually what you're seeing is so great you won't notice.

Overall My Lovely Sam Soon is a fantastic series that I recommend to pretty much anyone. except for femminists, I know there is a big cultrual gap between the east and the west but seriously this girl for the entire first episode and a lot of the series is treated like crap. her Mom is angry with her because she is not married at 30 already calling her an old maid (at 30?) and she goes for a job interview and the guy she's taliking to says she will never get a job as she is not pretty and all women should be pretty all the time. All I'm saying try pulling that crap over here that girl is gonna beat the crap out of you.",1257120000,5,2199,4.111627906976744

2423511,5,B000BLAK76,"This is one of the better dramedies korean soaps out there. Highly enjoyable. What I really liked about this is the fact that in the end... something you don't see a lot in korean soaps is a single couple together in bed and enjoying each other's company. No sex scenes, but it's realistic. Its not the usual respect the family over the hero/heroine feelings, but about a real girl, getting older, struggling to make ends meet, finding unexpectedly a Mr. Just RightNow and making it work.

The latter are very good and bring an interesting twist to the story. Of the half dozen k-dramas that I've viewed, this is easily the best one. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed it to the point of going to bed 1 - 2 in the morning to watch as many episodes as possible in one day. It is quite addictive.",1216166400,,571,4.39622641509434

2423519,4,B000BLAK76,"I notice that despite Sam Soon's avoirdupois, other characters' dress sense is really more ridiculous e.g. her paramour's shirt in Episode 2. What is with the widehipped accentuating outfits on the returnee and does Daniel Henney really ""stir"" anything in the audience? I don't get it. I have to believe that the impression created contrary to the hype is as intentional as is the inexplicably bad hair on the clever girl character. Side-by-side, Korean American boy is not the heartthrob of the series nor is he the breakout. Kim Suna does an excellent job as Sam Soon and her weight increase highlights her pretty nose and sweet mouth. Sam Soon suffers so much in the story that I really can't understand the other reviews about her inner strength. She gets pushed around for the whole show, she just complains about it. There were at least two good coffee tables in this series. For a Korean drama, there was an absence of noticeably crazy furniture. I liked the Irish Spring bathtub and toilet. I want to know what Sam Soon wrote on the restaurant cake after crossing paths with Chae Ree with her fiance for the first time. The best thing about the show that everyone else finds SUPER hilarious is the scene when Sam Soon's paramour tells Daniel Henney (according to the subtitles), ""I don't like you. You're stupid."" That scene literally warms my heart.

This series contains many feints. It's sneaky.

Also, it is not realistic which makes a riposte to the demand for Cinderella endings in standard Korean romance dramas.  SNEAKY.",1167955200,2,1536,4.832699619771863

I have shown this series to several people of different ages, backgrounds and interests, many of whom hate romantic comedies, but I have yet to find a person who doesn't love it.

It is very low budget and the soundtrack appears to be compiled of really bad midi files, but those are the only drawbacks.  The cast couldn't be more talented, the dialogue couldn't be more amusing, and the plot couldn't be more gripping.  The characters have so much personality, each one being loopy in their own unique way and clash with each other in the most hilarious and original situations.

This gets compared to Bridget Jones Diary quite a bit, which I can understand to some extent but doesn't really do the show justice.  It has in common with Bridget Jones Diary an adorably neurotic heroine who obsesses over her weight and constantly gets herself into humiliating situations, but I think it is much more clever, much more funny and reaches a much broader audience than Bridget Jones Diary.
