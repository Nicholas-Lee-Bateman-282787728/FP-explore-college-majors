3695338,3,B001MBTRWS,"This is another cookie cutter documentary about one of our beautiful National Parks. I guess these shows are necessary to maintain public support. Is it me or do all park rangers look like fraternal twins? No matter what age difference exists between them they all look and sound the same. Also, it seems to me they have the same Colarado dialect sound in their speech. This to me, seems to be the case no matter what section of the country they work in they all have that Western Colorado accent no matter if they're in the deepest swamps of Georgia.  Maybe that's a prerequisite for the job. I mean to look and sound alike.
Another thing that irks me about Park Rangers is their seeming happiness. It is as if they exude a serendipitous contentment with themselves and their jobs and they just want to share the happiness and good work they're doing with everyone. No one can possibly be that happy.
In future I recommend these documentaries avoid interviews with park employees and use a narrator.",1375142400,,1000,4.649717514124294
3695339,4,B001MBTRWS,"I wish it was longer: I am a photographer who spends many hours in the park, both on and off road. this very short video gives a wonder introduction to the park. Spoken words that do not over power the visuals a well done intro.",1368921600,,228,4.088888888888889
3695340,1,B001MBTRWS,Very disappointed with this video. It is only about 10 minutes long and gives only very genaric information about the Park. It is useless for planning a visit to the Park. Very over priced for what you get.,1335657600,,206,4.447368421052632
3695341,5,B001MBTRWS,"Having worked at Rocky Mountain National Park, I found this video an enchanting way to revisit its familiar beautiful places.  Good show!",1291680000,,137,5.2272727272727275
8320882,5,B001MBTRWS,It is a short documentary on RMNP. There is not much history or any other explanation.,1477526400,,86,4.4375
8320883,2,B001MBTRWS,Very limited. Having visited Rocky Mountain National Park several times I think a more extensive discussion and views of the park are warranted. Perhaps an interview with a ranger discussing the different areas. The area of the headwaters of the Colorado river is a beautiful region not shown or discussed.,1462752000,,306,5.14
8320884,4,B001MBTRWS,"i'm not sure if i'm confusing this with the nature oarks as opposed to the nature wonders; this title suggests a far more comprehensive
and spectacular coverage and superior film quality than the other, if so this one is highly recommended; so check out both!",1437264000,,259,4.777777777777778
8320885,5,B001MBTRWS,I loved this show as it reminds me of the beautiful Rocky Mountains and how much I have missed vacationing there in the summers.,1394668800,,128,4.375
8320886,2,B001MBTRWS,This is older video footage and offers limited park information - regardless it does show some lovely features of the park.,1387411200,,123,4.904761904761905
8320887,5,B001MBTRWS,"Anytime I have a chance to ""visit"" our wonderful national parks, I know the show can't help but be wonderful.  So much beauty to see and information to learn.  Rocky Mountain National Park is one of several I have never had the opportunity to visit in person, so this gave me the opportunity to experience being there.  I rated it a 5 due to the entire production/filming, as the magnificent beauty speaks for itself upon seeing it up close, and yet afar.",1380499200,,455,4.524390243902439
8320888,2,B001MBTRWS,"I purchased this just as I returned from my first trip to Rocky Mountain National Park, hoping to learn more about this wonderful place. Sadly, this film is quite short and must have been made long ago.  Such a national treasure deserves an update with better writing and production.",1378252800,,283,4.775510204081633
8320889,5,B001MBTRWS,"Interesting, informative and very well done.  I look forward to viewing more similar programs in the very near future.  Thanks.",1377734400,,127,5.3
8320890,3,B001MBTRWS,"Not HD & outdated. I wouldn't watch it again, and that's my criteria for a good video.experience. Kids get bored real quick!",1377734400,,124,4.681818181818182
8320891,1,B001MBTRWS,"Only 10 minutes long. Very little footage. The narrator refers to the park as ""Rocky Mountains National Park,"" not Rocky Mountain National Park. Very poor indeed. Almost fun to watch just to hear how awful the narration actually is. A good video on Rocky is ""Real Rocky."" Another is Spirit of the Mountains though its only 20 minutes long.",1375660800,,339,4.762711864406779
