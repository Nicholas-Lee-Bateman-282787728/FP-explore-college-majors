7976601,4,B00007IG1D,"Bias Alert! I am a big fan of Terrence Hill westerns, ""They Call Me nobody', ""My Name is Trinity"" and Trinity is Still My Name"".  These are truly Spaghetti Westerns and they are not on the level of the Clinton Eastwood westerns. But 4 films for under $5 is a good deal if you enjoy 1970's type westerns. Also this has nothing in common with Django Unchained with Jamie Foxx, Leonardo Di Caprio. So please don't be fooled these are all ""B"" movies with no major stars.",1420675200,,466,4.35632183908046
7976602,5,B00007IG1D,"Classic spaghetti western films as usual. Some I can recall during my early childhood days watching it overseas. Though here it is consider as ""Rated R"" and must have an adult to supervise or get to be one when seeing it in the theater...but overseas...it was not even dealt with. I was watching movies that some are even consider as ""NC-17"" nowadays.",1410739200,,351,4.67741935483871

7976604,1,B00007IG1D,This set looks like it was boot-legged at a theater. Abyssmal video and audio. A complete disappointment. Especially because I bought this as a gift.,1390348800,3,149,5.0
7976605,5,B00007IG1D,"I do not review movies. There are plenty of reviews out there, some good, some bad, and every one has an opinion. I recommend, based on the title and description and if is the type of movie that you like, buy it and decide for your self if you like it or not.",1380758400,,259,3.9056603773584904
7976606,5,B00007IG1D,"Oh they just don't make'em like this anymore. If you're 40 to 50 years old and want to take a trip back in time to the days of drive in movies and the classic western genre of the 60's and early 70's Then this set is a must. If you love the ""Trinity"" collection you will love this. I didn't even know these existed until I got on Amazon and started my search. It is the dialog, the action and even the sound of the guns that defines this genre and they just don't make'em like this anymore!",1369785600,10,490,4.010204081632653
