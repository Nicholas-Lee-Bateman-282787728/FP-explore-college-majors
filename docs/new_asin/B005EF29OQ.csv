8468176,3,B005EF29OQ,"My two girls love the Octonauts.  However this product has a few issues with it.

1.  DVD Compatibility.  This is a Region 2 DVD and will only play in European DVD players or Region Free players.  You can get a region free player relatively cheaply on Amazon; the best solution is to get a player that lets you switch the region yourself.  It's harder to find a region free portable player.

2.  Some characters have different voices.  ""What?!""  That's right, if you're used to the Disney Junior episodes, be prepared for a mild shock.  This original BBC version of the Octonauts has different voice actors for Peso, Dashi, Tweak and Pinto (Peso's little brother).  Barnacles, Kwazii and Inkling are the same.  Peso is the most grating as instead of his Hispanic accent he has a young boy's British accent (ditto for Pinto).  Dashi also sounds British (instead of vanilla American), but she usually doesn't talk much so it's ok.  Tweak still has a southern/country accent but it isn't as broad and the voice actor is obviously different.  My girls mostly just rolled with it (""Hey!  Peso's voice has changed!""), but my 3 year-old's favorite character changed from Peso to Tunip (presumably because she didn't like the Dickensian lad's voice).

3.  The Creature Reports are not part of the episodes.  They are included in the extras, but you'd have to get to them from the menu if you want to play the one that matches the episode the kids just watched.  A bit annoying.

4.  Finally, there is a 3 disc complete 1st series boxed set available on a certain UK sister site.  If you can overlook the above issues, that is the superior set.

Hope that helps.
