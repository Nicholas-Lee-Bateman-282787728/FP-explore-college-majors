8744032,5,B0195H0I4Q,"Director/story/ screenplay writer Christopher McQuarrie keeps the fast action, droll humor, and level of excitement in this new version of Mission Impossible and to this viewers experience it works very well indeed.

CIA chief Hunley (Alec Baldwin) convinces a Senate committee to disband the IMF (Impossible Mission Force), of which Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is a key member. Hunley argues that the IMF is too reckless. Now on his own, Hunt goes after a shadowy and deadly rogue organization called the Syndicate. Ethan and team (Jeremy Renner, Simon Pegg, and Ving Rhames) take on their most impossible mission yet, eradicating the Syndicate - an International rogue organization as highly skilled as they are, committed to destroying the IMF. Key figures are Ilsa Faust (a dazzling Rebecca Ferguson), Lane (Sean Harris), and Atlee (Simon McBurney)  with a brief but well offered appearance as Prime Minister of England Tom Hollander.

Strong cast (Cruise still has what the role takes), excellent special effects, smart script, lush color photography and even some time allowed to listen to a performance of Turandot at the Vienna Stadtsoper  all add up to an enjoyable escape outing.
