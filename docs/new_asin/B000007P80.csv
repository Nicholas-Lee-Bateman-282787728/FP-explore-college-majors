1196614,1,B000007P80,"I bought this movie for my collection of 60's biker flicks and rapidly became sorry that I had. Thinking that Dern and Ladd were somewhat acceptable in the thoroughly enjoyable ""The Wild Angels"", I decided to give them another try with ""The Rebel Rousers"". The title implies an exciting biker romp but after watching this, instead of excitement, I felt complete numbness...What dialog there is seems adlibbed, makes no sense, or is hard to understand, the supposedly Mexican people, which the small town is populated with look remarkably Causasian and have the worst phoney accents I've ever heard (they were so bad it wasn't even funny), and the bike scenes are rare and poorly planned. Everything about this movie was poorly planned... I should have been warned by the advertised plot, knowing that the bikers would be scheming on a pregnant woman, but I didn't expect her to be 8 months pregnant....I'll bet the actors who played in this movie are mortified that it can still be viewed... I thought that Hells Belles was the worst movie I had ever seen, but this one has just taken it's place, making Hells Belles seem like a pretty good movie in comparison. Save your money or you'll be really sorry.",1162598400,18,1204,4.793269230769231
1196615,5,B000007P80,"quite a trippy and moving story this movie has to offer

full of odd situations

great characters

interesting ending

in a way Jack is a good guy in this

because he doesn't always look interested in the gang he's in

and at times he is the bad guy with what he does and wants to do

but still a great performance by the whole cast

it shall be seen more times then I can count trust me

and it too also offers insights on life and such

see again what you can learn",1109376000,,467,3.924731182795699
1196616,5,B000007P80,"Yes, Rebel Rousers is a great Bad Biker Movie. I wasn't sure at first, as it starts off a little tepidly, but by the finale, the absurdities were piling up at such an astonishing rate that any doubts that it merits Trash Classic status had long since evaporated. First, the Rebel Rousers are one motley, unconventional movie biker gang: Bruce Dern is fascinating as always as the sensitive (!), moral (!), philosophical (!) gang leader, J. J.; Harry Dean Stanton as sarcastic Randolph, his lapels and fedora festooned with buttons, looks like some kind of punk-rock zoot-suiter; another gang member is a meditating Hebrew; and yet another a violent, leering Cowboy-psycho type. Jack Nicholson, wearing B&W striped prisoners' pants, stocking cap, and scarf, gives one of his prototypical nasty jerk characterizations as J. J.'s chief rival, Bunny, a more generic `scuzzy biker dude.' They all roll into a dusty border town (Chloride, Arizona), where the chief pasttime seems to be playing checkers, and literally run into Paul Collier (Cameron Mitchell), an old high school football buddy of Dern's. Diane Ladd (then-Mrs. Dern) plays Collier's pregnant, estranged girlfriend Karen, who's shacked up in the local motel. Ladd and Mitchell try to inject some seriousness into the proceedings with earnest but meaningless, convoluted discussions about their relationship (accompanied by romantic guitars, flutes, electric piano, and cigarettes). Meanwhile, the bikers terrorize the local Padre and a little boy, and party wildly at the town watering hole, where they dance and strip on the bar, and introduce themselves to tippling little old ladies and farmers. Paul and Karen run afoul of the bikers, who argue a lot incoherently, and hold races on the beach to see who gets to have Ladd for the night. Assorted priceless moments include: Mitchell smoldering while the creepy bikers make shameless, lascivious plays for Ladd right in front of him; Bob Dix as Miguel performing the Mexican hat dance at his birthday party; a bloodied, frustrated Mitchell seeking help from the checker-playing farmers and drunks at the bar; Dern performing a ""wedding,"" reciting passages from the Harley Davidson Service Manual (their ""Bible""); Mitchell casually saying ""Hi, Bunny"" to Nicholson; and Nicholson arguing with Dern, who says ""Don't look at me with that kind of grin on your face!"" Like other bad biker movies, Rebel Rousers is, shall we say, thinly plotted and unfocused, with many scenes that seem improvised, directorial flourishes that will leave you scratching your head (like the final shot, for instance), and enough bad dialogue for several movies. According to Dern, this was filmed in 1966 and shelved, then had a limited release in 1970 timed to cash in on Nicholson's star turn in Easy Rider. The soundtrack of generic Ventures/Arrows-style twang sounds about right for `66. The cinematography by then-unknown Laszlo Kovacs (Easy Rider, Five Easy Pieces, Shampoo, Ghost Busters, etc.) looks typically fine, although some of the dialogue is obscured by background noise, loud music, or everyone talking at once. Dumb, strange, hilarious, and never boring, this is right up there with The Hellcats in the pantheon of Sublimely Bad Biker Movies. From the producers of The Brain That Wouldn't Die and Nightmare in Wax! Recommended.
This review is being posted under the ""Passion Productions"" DVD release, though I actually viewed Rhino's DVD edition, which may be going out of print but is still fairly easily obtainable at this writing (it has the same cover art as their VHS). Rhino's transfer looks surprisingly fine, better than I had expected, with some minor speckling, but otherwise displaying well saturated color (!!) and acceptable fleshtones, crisp detail, and good contrast/black level. The movie doesn't appear to have been shot widescreen and there is no mention of this in IMDb, so the full-frame transfer is not problematic. There are no extras other than 18 chapter stops, but Rhino gets points just for putting such an obscurity out in such a nice transfer. From comments in other reviews, it seems the other DVD editions of this are typical PD junk, so definitely track down the Rhino version.",1062201600,5,4211,5.203240058910162
1196617,1,B000007P80,"The archtypal bad biker flick.  This movie has a great cast--Bruce Dern, Jack Nicholson, Harry Dean Stanton, Cameron Mitchell, Diane Ladd--and probably the worst writing you will run into.  As a matter of fact, maybe  it wasn't written at all.  Many of the scenes look as if they must have  been extemporized (if that is a kinder term than ""adlibbed"").  Great fun to watch.  Jack Nicholson's pants are worth the trip!",939686400,2,417,4.788732394366197
1196618,4,B000007P80,Its cool to see old Jack in this during is younger times. Another good one to add to the Jack Nicholson collection.,1331683200,,115,4.2727272727272725

1196620,2,B000007P80,"Man, what a bummer!  Jack Nicholson, Bruce Dern, Diane Ladd, Harry Dean Stanton, Cameron Mitchell - with a cast like that in a biker movie, you'd think it would be great.  Very little chopper scenes, and the bikers' outfits looked like they were grabbed from a thrift store.  Biker chicks? - Forget about it!  There were a couple shown briefly, with one stripping down to, dare I say it - her bra!  The storyline is the typical bad boys getting out of hand - with one grabbing a straight guy's pregnant girlfriend after beating him up. I won't give away the ending - in case someone just has to buy this barker.",1274745600,,611,4.419642857142857

1196622,1,B000007P80,"This has got to be one of the cheesiest biker films ever made.  The plot is thin, and the acting reminds me of a grade school play.  I bet Jack Nicholson and Bruce Dern are regretting they were ever involved in this film.",1252886400,,221,4.116279069767442

I love Nicholson, and I like biker movies.
This was a waste from start to finish.

1196625,3,B000007P80,"Rebel Rousers is one of the many so-called ""Outlaw"" biker movies from the late sixties and early seventies. Interesting only, because it shows a young Jack Nickolson, who started his carriere in bikermovies, for which he does not want te be remembered! What can I say? It is amusing, but you forget it after watching!",1209254400,2,317,4.781818181818182
1196626,5,B000007P80,"Hilariously bad! I love old Drive-In style biker flicks and this one is even worse than She-Devils On Wheels. A real gem of bad editing (the music is so loud at times you can't hear the dialogue), poor acting & blatant ad-libbing. This movie must have taken a whole week to make. All the bikes are Triumphs but Bruce Dern reads from a Harley-Davidson Service Manual. I loved Nicholson's prison striped pants with the dirty seat and a hole in them. I laughed my but off on this one.",1206403200,7,481,4.415730337078652
1196627,3,B000007P80,"this movie is for people who want to collect biker b-movies, not for those looking for great acting, story, or production budget.  so, there are some nice bikes worth seeing here and the plot is silly enough to have fun with. definitely a cheap thrill and i'm glad to have it in my collection.",1203897600,,293,4.425925925925926

7905109,1,B000007P80,"I rented this film from the library just for the curiosity of seeing Jack Nicholson before his break through role in ""Easy Rider"".  This is a terrible movie and Jack, Bruce Fern & Diane Ladder fight a losing battle against bad direction, writing & intrusive music which ruins a quiet scene between Ladd & a comatose Cameron Mitchell who looks like he needs a drink.  Definitely for the non discriminating & people of low IQ.",1406592000,,424,4.64
