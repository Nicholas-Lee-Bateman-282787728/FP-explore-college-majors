2564592,5,B000FGFBTY,"I wept as I recognized poor white folks as they lived in the not so long ago. It could have been a documentary about one cousin of mine.

2564607,5,B000FGFBTY,"My Sociology class watched this movie this semester, and I loved it. We didn't get to see the whole movie, so I bought it to add to my collection. This movie covered a lot of the topics we had in class. I would recommend this for anyone. The slurs used in the movie were common in the time period this was covered, and was a teaching lesson that words used the wrong way, can hurt others. I'm currently waiting for the movie to arrive.",1418169600,,435,4.190476190476191

2564617,2,B000FGFBTY,I got the dvd looks good I started watching the movie and played good but somewhere in the middle the dvd stopped and skiped ahead I have another dvd player so I tryed it in that one but same thing happened. I tryed to clean dvd and play but same thing it skiped. I went into scene seletion and tryed to fast foward and rewind through the scene where it skiped. I was able to rewind it then try to watch it but it still would stop and skip the scene. so I gave up and just watched rest of the movie but I miss about 20 mins in the middle of the movie. Not what I like to see only part of it.,1321142400,,591,3.774193548387097
2564618,5,B000FGFBTY,"This was a very touching movie. I've seen it twice when it was on Liftime a few years ago. My daughters were much younger then. I didn't think they were mature enough to appreciate the movie at that time. But when I found the movie on Amazon I knew I had to purchase it. I watched the movie again with dauthers. They too were touched. It is a movie that I will still watch years to come.

Della Reese once again gave an outstanding performance.",1316390400,,444,4.223529411764706
2564619,5,B000FGFBTY,"I could not find this movie anywhere in a store. It is a very good

2564622,5,B000FGFBTY,"Oh my, what a movie. I am a big fan of Miss Della Reese. I love her to death. This is one movie everyone should see. Love the movie, and sensitive subject. A family movie. Its about a young white girl, growning up in poverty. Ms. Della Reese steps in with her husband ""To Tall"" played by Civil Rights Activist, Ossie Davis. Great Acting, Great Movie. A must see also!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1242777600,,392,4.614285714285714
2564623,5,B000FGFBTY,"This is a very good movie! A definite must see movie! I highly recommend it! It is about a woman who overhears her uppity, teenage daughter, making fun of this poor girl in school, and the woman decides to teach her daughter a lesson that she will never forget!

 The daughter begins to  learn things about her mother, and her mother's past that she never knew! The mother takes her to a place that holds unhappy memories, for her mother, and also tells her daughter about a wonderful loving, black couple that saved her life! This is a heartrending, and heartwarming, awesome story!

 This is a story about a very remarkable, strong, special woman who had all the odds against her during her awful childhood, growing up years, and also about a wonderful black elderly couple, who also had all the odds against them, and they befriended and loved this poor young white girl any way, because the girl had no one that cared!",1241049600,,922,4.597560975609756
2564624,5,B000FGFBTY,"Chasing Secrets is an inspirational story of a down-trodden and abused white girl befriended and given a wonderful chance in life by a poor black couple with excellent Christian values.  The film's strongest message is that any person, regardless of education or economic status, can make a difference in another person's life with love and a willingness to teach and guide.  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys seeing love, courage, and decency triumphing over wickedness.",1237939200,,494,5.2405063291139244
2564625,5,B000FGFBTY,"When you can get a teen-aged boy to watch this with his mom, you know you  have a wonderful movie!  It's one I dearly love.",1230076800,,123,3.88
2564626,5,B000FGFBTY,"I ORDERED THIS DVD FOR MY MOM, WHO HAD SEEN THE MOVIE ON TV. THE MOVIE IS HIGH ON HER ""FAVORITES LIST""!!",1216425600,,104,3.772727272727273
2564627,5,B000FGFBTY,"I don't know why I waited so long to see this movie. It is a 5 star. My husband and I both cried and laughed. Acting was superb and it was very well done.
Buy it-you will NOT be sorry!",1209686400,,184,3.625
2564628,5,B000FGFBTY,"This movie was truly heartwarming and endearing. I watched 3x's, i grew up in the south, so I'm familiar with the issues in this movie. Love is a conquering force, overcome evil with good, such a powerful and positive message of what love can do.",1202083200,,246,4.488888888888889
2564629,5,B000FGFBTY,"Who would think that a successful writer would get her start from two elderly black surrogate parents?  Chasing Secrets is the type of movie that tears at your heartstrings.  Della Reese is excellent as ""Honey"" a woman who has lost her own child and she takes in this abused white girl who is forced, by her abusive grandfather to do things no 14 year old should have to face.  Ossie Davis is his usual loveable character and plays well opposite Della Reese.  Crystal Bernard's character is also played well, as the misguided young mother.  Get your tissue box out as this movie packs a powerful punch.  It's a great movie about possibilities.",1187049600,,643,4.696428571428571
2564630,5,B000FGFBTY,"One of my favorite movies, and the story may be applicable to many of today's families. A well-to-do mother of two privileged teenage daughters finds them too prideful for her liking, so decides to show them their roots. She takes them to the place where she grew up, and tells them about the squalor and abuse of her own childhood--something they had previously known nothing about. The story unfolds about an elderly black couple who loved her, taught her, and gave her a chance at a real life. Warm, touching, and absorbing--and they do it without putting anything in that the whole family can't watch.",1182470400,,605,4.771428571428571
2564631,5,B000FGFBTY,"especially in this day and time!  I so loved it, will buy many copies and give away to fam and friends, I watched it in the middle of the day on Lifetime so I know many haven't seen it.. All actors involved are just fabulous, both girls, both elders, even the horrible people are great;-)  Watch it, own it, give it as a gift..beautifully directed, and on & on~",1178582400,,361,4.217391304347826
2564632,5,B000FGFBTY,"This movie is one of the best I've seen in a long time.  Della Reese

is outstanding in her performance and is backed by another great performance by Ozzie Davis.  A great family movie, that teaches children not to judge other kids by their social status.  I would give this movie 6 stars if they would let me.",1171584000,,310,4.293103448275862
8122151,5,B000FGFBTY,This is one loving movie and a good example for loving anyone's child that is being abused.  This loving AfAmercian couple showed what sensible love is.,1516924800,,152,4.846153846153846
8122152,5,B000FGFBTY,Purchased as a gift.,1512950400,,20,4.25
8122153,5,B000FGFBTY,"I love this movie. I have watched many movies over the last 15 years. But very few of them hit home like this movie did . The acting is great , the plot is wonderful. And when you finish the movie theres a good feeling that you have at the end. I would definitely recommend this movie to someone looking for characters that comprise of strength, that grasp opportunity, And just a general feeling of warmth at the end. It is a true reflection of how much one person, the right person can change a childs life. I loved Della Reeses acting!",1511136000,,538,4.284313725490196
8122154,5,B000FGFBTY,enjoyed the movie very much,1508716800,,27,4.6
8122155,5,B000FGFBTY,Great acting and a look what to see where we have come from and know that sometimes progress comes slowly.,1508025600,,106,4.35
8122156,4,B000FGFBTY,"This is an excellent movie about child abuse, plain and simple. The story itself rings true as the abused girl found refuge in a loving Black couple, who lived in a ramshackle house nearby. They rescued, nurtured, and protected her, to the extent possible for this time period. Della Reese and Ossie Davis are superb in their portrayal of this compassionate couple. The love and care extended to this little girl by them was heartwarming and a lesson to all parents on how to take care of our children. The dresses for the little girl were not believable as they looked more like they came out of vogue magazine than the impoverished, rural country she lived in. The fairly new saddle oxford shoes and matching socks didn't make much sense either. Growing up poor means your shoes are too small and worn out, and when you're neglected, you hardly ever have socks that match. The actors, including the little girl, carried the movie. I'd give all three an A+, the cinematography an A, but the overall production a C-.  Want to make a special mention of the actress who played the little girl's mother. I've not seen her before or since in any movie. It was a flawless interpretation and performance of a troubled mother, raised in the same wretched conditions as her daughter. (Brava!)",1506470400,,1284,4.706666666666667
8122157,5,B000FGFBTY,Very good story-line.  The movie is little shorter version than the book that I recall that it was based on but none the less it was well worth the money and has an excellent plot.  Arrived quickly and reasonably priced.,1502668800,,220,4.475
8122158,5,B000FGFBTY,Excellent Movie!!!  So much going on for both families and the struggles of life.  So many teaching moments that are even applicable today.,1501977600,,139,5.0
8122159,5,B000FGFBTY,A very special story. One that's lost through the years.,1497571200,,56,4.7
8122160,5,B000FGFBTY,"This movie was really incredible and profound! I am so grateful that my family and I have it for the long haul, as opposed to a rental. Unfortunately, it had a few scratches on the back of the disc, however, it still ran well.",1496448000,,226,4.159090909090909
