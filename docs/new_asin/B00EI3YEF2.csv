8605545,4,B00EI3YEF2,"I've been an admirer of Steve Pyke's photography for a while and thought that this would be a great chance to see him at work. This is a very well put together film, showing not only how a photographer works with his subjects and creates his art, but also how he probes their minds and thoughts.

Listening to the astronauts relive their very personal accounts of their pioneering travel, Pyke takes them from the comfort of their own homes back into deepest, darkest space. I certainly wouldn't class the filming as low grade, it's shot in a very intimate way and I think the conversations with the astronauts are much more candid because of it, instead of the more formal interviews with a full film crew standing around.

It's easy to understand how their perception of the universe is changed by their experiences and how they gained a new view of our tiny planet and its place in the grand scheme of things from high above! This is a compelling watch for both fans of space and photography - I would highly recommend it.",1385424000,,1025,4.565217391304348
8605546,2,B00EI3YEF2,This is really a friend with a cam corder documenting a still photographers search of astronauts to make portraits of and its really amateurish all around. I had great hopes but it is very hard to watch and really poor quality... no excuse these days for such.,1381276800,,260,4.553191489361702
