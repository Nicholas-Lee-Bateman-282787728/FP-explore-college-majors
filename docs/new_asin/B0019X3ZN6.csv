8275486,3,B0019X3ZN6,"Grind (1997) is a movie that is greatly underestimated, perhaps for
the lack of big name actors and crew, except for perhaps Frank
Vincent.

In reality, this work is powerful, and at least over 90 mins,
relatively fascinating, from a story rooted in a realism that
cannot be denied (anyone reading the tabloids), coupled with an
undeniable charisma of the actors and actresses, their simplicity,
bursting youth and natural presence on screen.

The topic has already been covered, in MONUMENT AVE (aka SNITCH
1998), in terms of a ""chop shop"" .. meaning, in the downturn of the
economy, a divorce, hardship, some individuals may turn to
insurance fraud to reap financial gains, as automobiles are resold
for their value in parts.

Frank Vincent does a fine job, as the father of 2 grown men, one of
which is like the turtle who finishes first, steady but slowly from
his 9 to 5 job down at a metal finishing plant, while the other son
is the proverbial hare, winning car races, but distracted in terms
of his own life objectives, and unaware of his social surroundings
and repercussions of a clumsy conduct.

Adrienne Shelly is a remarkable actress, with a low-key presence,
yet subtle, with a convincing human presence, passionate and
interesting to watch.

Paul Schulze, as the husband, is equally interesting, as the story
intertwines that of 2 brothers, and how the two deal with disparate
circumstances, their own differences and talents but loyal to one
another as brothers.

Saul Stein is credible as a tough businessman in the underworld,
who dabbles in the money gain game, but who s not prepared to lower
himself to having blood on his hands.

From a cinematic point of view, the scenes are crystal clear, as is
the audio and the  realism of the story and action, although not
rising to a wide-screen caliber. It also and lacks subtitles. The
music is fine, and well chosen.

Examples of life events that may ""connect"" with the audience are
backyard BBQ's, the arrival of a baby, the boredom of work, and its
politics, celebration of birthdays,  parties, great looking women.

The movie  suggests that one's character is evaluated in how one
deals with a passion, in this case car racing,  that one doesn't
want to give up, yet not sufficiently financially viable or
sustainable as a livelihood.

How readily does an individually give in to the temptation,
crossing the line,  into into the underworld, or to sexual passion,
of gambling, to the tedious 9 to 5 routine, in sum, of ""the grind.""",1236988800,,2500,4.822014051522248
