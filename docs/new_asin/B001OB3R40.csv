8330185,5,B001OB3R40,An entertaining adult dvd,1498694400,,25,5.5
8330186,4,B001OB3R40,"A little amateurish, yet if you enjoyed some of the other erotic parodies with their rather stilted animated loops, you'll probably like this one.",1420329600,,146,5.125
8330187,1,B001OB3R40,"Video was weak.  No issues for delivery, very short video.  Graphics could have been better, mostly still pictures.  Price a little high for what you get from it.",1386979200,2,162,4.714285714285714
8330188,2,B001OB3R40,"...Imagine the combinatio of your favorite toon-animated characters (Zodiac's Saint Seya, or the Wolverine) in sensual action...Not something to look up to. Besides the graphics are not that good. Mainly stills and repeated secuences. Stick up to their common outakes in wich u met these guys in the first place.",1258675200,,312,5.26
8330189,2,B001OB3R40,"This one done a little better but the soundtrack was horrible. Another lack of imagination, I'm pretty sure there are more females in the Knights of the Zodiac, the Fushiyugi was subpar, the voicerover in the X-Men horrible, and the 4th one was the only one I've actually liked since it didn't do any annoying voices and was straight-forward. For crying out loud, the Chun-Li & Kasumi sketch could of had more done to it. I know I would if I had creative control. Someone should of had a bullet put through their head for such a short scene.",1190851200,8,541,4.474747474747475
8330190,1,B001OB3R40,"well lets see where to start. animation was terrible, audio was off and even then the voices were bad. sounded like they just recorded a bad porn soundtrack from afuzzy screen and just added it in. all in all i broke the disc as soon as i finished watching it. it is just not worth having, paying for, or even thinking about.",1174867200,16,325,4.258064516129032
