8556528,5,B00AQN06TQ,"when i heard about an animated version of old Ricky Gervais podcasts, my mindbrain immediately jumped to ""that just can't be any good.""  for the first time ever, i was wrong.  the Flinstoney style is the perfect vehicle for Mr. Karl Pilkington's quirky look on life.  i've seen each of these episodes at least four times each, and still thoroughly crack up.  few shows/flicks are worth repeated viewings in my book, but i honestly can't tire of this set.  surprising perfection.",1427241600,,478,4.851851851851852
