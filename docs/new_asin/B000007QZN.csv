1196955,4,B000007QZN,"Take a trip back to a simpler time, when an unassuming teenage girl could track down the missing evidence in a messy murder trial.  Carolyn Keene's  ""Nancy Drew"" series received definitive screen versions in the late 1930s thanks to the Warner Brothers films franchise starring Bonita Granville as teen sleuth Nancy Drew.

In NANCY DREW...REPORTER (filmed in 1939), we follow Nancy while she works as a student reporter at the city newsdesk.  Enterprising young lady that she is, Nancy secretly swaps her assigned story for a hot murder trial, where pretty chemical lab assistant Eula Denning (Betty Amann) will surely go to the gas chamber unless Nancy uncovers the vital evidence that will clear her name.  Nancy teams with her next-door-neighbour Ted Nickerson (Frankie Thomas) as they set off on a dangerous, thrill-packed race against time...

Bonita Granville remains the definitive screen Nancy; the perfect embodiment of the enterprising, go-gettum spirit of the books.  Frankie Thomas (best-remembered as TV's ""Tom Corbett: Space Cadet"") is also very fine as the reluctant stooge to Nancy's crime capers.

Playing two troublesome whistle bomb-wielding children, Mary Lee and Dickie Jones are veteran scene-stealers.  John Litel plays Nancy's father, with Larry Williams, Sheila Bromley and Thomas E. Jackson.

The print on offer from Alpha Video Classics is quite good-quality, and the price is certainly very nice.  (Single-sided, single-layer disc).",1179964800,2,1460,5.473214285714286
1196956,5,B000007QZN,"Bonita Granville was a delightful ball of fun during the 1930's in this ""B"" series from WB. This entry was one of the best in the series. She looks cute as a button dressed by Milo Anderson and brings energy to the ""B"" script by Kenneth Gamet. Director William Clemens keeps everything moving quickly for an enjoyable bit of fun for young mystery fans, and film buffs fond of the always terrific Bonita Granville.

Nancy gets her chance as a reporter along with some other girls as a promotion run by the local paper. There's a fifty dollar prize and a medal for the student who turns in the best story after three days. The weary editor hands out some generic fluff to each girl but, of course, Nancy is more interested in the big story involving the death of rich elderly woman, and off she goes to the inquest instead.

When the verdict turns out to be murder by a rare poison used in photograhy, Nancy is hot on the case! Betty Amann is the innocent girl, Paula Denning, Nancy tries to clear by beating everyone to the container with the real killer's fingerprints on it. But a boxer named Soxie (Jack Perry) with a disfigured ear wants it too and uses his girlfriend (Sheila Bromley) to grab it from her in a crowd.

Nancy can't do it alone so enlists the help of her pal Ted (Frank Thomas Jr.) with a new hat. Granville and Thomas were good together and it was endearing that he didn't quite realize he was Nancy's boyfriend. Dickie Jones and Mary Lee were also fun as Ted's young siblings wrangling their way into everything. There's a fun scene where they end up having to sing for their meal at the Mandarin Cafe while in hot pursuit of the story.

John Litel portrayed Nancy's dad, Carson Drew, in the series and there is one especially nice scene between the two that is filled with warmth and the fun of a father/daughter relationship. Nancy tricks him into helping the Denning girl but with Nancy and her pals on the case, the outcome is never really in doubt.

There is a delightful entry with a marvelous ending typical of the series. This one is a fine mix of energy and humor and won't disappoint fans of the sweet Bonita Granville, a young and shining star from the era who deserves to be remembered.",1173571200,10,2218,4.439803439803439
1196957,4,B000007QZN,"""Nancy Drew ... Reporter"" is an enjoyable 68-minute black & white detective film from 1939.

Nancy (Bonita Branville at 16), has entered the ""River Heights Tribune""`s contest for best student reporter.  She assigns herself to a murder case in which a woman was poisoned by a new photography chemical.  Nancy interviews the accused individual and learns that the poison's container may permanently record the fingerprints of those who touch it.  Nancy is determined to find the container and win the release of the accused.  Since Nancy's father, successful lawyer Carson Drew (John Litel), is reluctant to help at first, she turns to her friend, Ted Nickerson (Frankie Thomas at 18).  Nancy and Ted get mixed up with a boxer, a will, a policeman dressing as a woman, and wax cylinder recordings.  Nancy does many clever things, including figuring out phone numbers and escaping locked utility rooms (funny!) on the way to success.

The mystery story itself is not difficult to follow, and we come to know the bad guys early on.  The main pleasure is the natural, easy-going working relationship between Nancy and Ted.  Bonita Branville does a good job of balancing sleuthing rigor with being Daddy's girl and Ted's pal.  Frankie Thomas injects light comic touches in being Nancy's slightly overwhelmed assistant.  The Nancy of the film feels more girlish and flexible than the Nancy of the early book series.

I have seen quite a few of the films released by Alpha Video, and this one has a much higher picture and sound quality than just about all of them.

Given the times and the source material, there is no sex or gore.  The only skin scene is a brief boxing match between an attractive Ted and an unattractive bad guy.

The one annoyance is the presence of two brats, Ted's younger sister, Mary, and her sidekick, Killer Perkins, who show up to pester the two leads.  One prank does contribute to the final scene but seems a high price to pay.

At this point, ""Nancy Drew ... Reporter"" is the only film from its series to make it to DVD.  It would be nice to have the rest released too.",1141344000,,2092,4.7292817679558015
1196958,4,B000007QZN,"I am now uncertain if she called her neighbor Ted or Ned after reading the other reviews! I thought it was Ned her boyfriend as I could not see a married man (saw wedding ring on his finger while using the phone)helping out Nancy. His wife would be angry and why would she not call on Ned her boyfriend? I also missed her girlfriends Bess and George and wanted a longer more involved mystery that they all could be in,including the maid! Now I will have to watch it over again to make sure who is who! Seems like they tried to make a ""filler"" movie,but Granville is still great as Nancy Drew!!",1138147200,,593,4.256637168141593
1196959,4,B000007QZN,"This movie is the product of a pre-feminist era. Nancy was a girl who TOOK CHARGE. Bonita Granville is adorable, but she's just not the Nancy I grew up with.

1196960,5,B000007QZN,"This is a very entertaining, wholesome and excellent B movie with sparkling dialogue, good comic scenes and lots of action as Nancy Drew solves a murder while along the way getting her many friends in more trouble than they care to be in. Bonita and Frankie Thomas are excellent as they uncover the clues.

Little Dickie Jones, who, at the age of 6, was performing lariat tricks and riding in Hoot Gibson's rodeo and  was also the voice for Disney's Pinocchio, and first timer Mary Lee, who frequently appeared in Gene Autry and Roy Rogers movies, are also very good playing Nancy's pesky friends.  Dickie gets to show off his Donald Duck impersonation, while Mary sings swing in a voice that would put many American Idol winners to shame.

Bonita Granville starred in 4 of these Nancy Drew movies.  This is the second in the series.  Top notch entertainment. Highly recommend despite less than good print.",1116892800,,906,4.7756410256410255

I give this item 4 stars because 1: I love Nancy Drew, 2: The story is good, and 3: Bonita Granville does a good job.

But, Where is Hannah? Where is Togo? Where is Bess? Where is George? Where is Ned? Where all the these characters that are just as important as Nancy??

Actually, there is a Ned. Well, Ted, really. But he is a whimpy scairdy-cat.

Don't you think these films would have made a great hit if they actually copied the books to some degree?

Can you imagine the Secret of Red Gate Farm, or The Ringmasters Secret as a film! Wonderful! The fans would flock!

But no. And why not? I don't know. Bonita is great. She is really clever, and funny, but without the REAL characters, it's hard to even refer to this film as Nancy Drew.",1106438400,26,763,4.227586206896552

Nancy comes across young, smart and with a lot more opportunities than anyone has a right to expect.  But she's not spoiled and you can't help falling in love with Bonita Granville's portrayal of the heroine.

1196981,3,B000007QZN,"Nancy Drew, Reporter, 1939 film

The film begins in a newspaper office. Students will work for three days as cub reporters. ""Can I cover a scandal?"" ""Journalism is a noble career."" Each student draws an assignment. Nancy Drew makes a choice: the coroner's inquest. It was poison, not a heart condition! This chemical is used in photography. The beneficiary of Kate Lambert's will is the suspect. Eula Denning is held for murder. A car chase provides action. The Lambert house is sealed, but a man tried to enter. ""Reporters do it in the movies."" The story in the newspaper makes Denning look guilty. Nancy's intuition tells her Denning isn't guilty. A whistle bomb? Two mischievous children? Will Ted Nickerson help Nancy? Nancy is clever! They interview Eula Denning in jail and learn about the missing tin of chemicals.

Is entering illegal? ""Not for a reporter."" Ted distracts the guard in a card game. Nancy sneaks into the house and finds the can. But a female confederate snatches the can and runs away! Carlton Drew, the lawyer, is surprised by Nancy's promise. Was it a mistake? The man with a bent ear is a clue. Nancy goes to the newspaper morgue for research, and finds a photograph. She has a plan to learn more about Soxie. Ted volunteers. Nancy gets a telephone number, then counts the pulses from the dial! Nancy adjusts Ted's boxing glove. ""What happened?"" Nancy tracks down Miss Lucas, and finds her with Miles Lambert (Kate's nephew). She drops a nickel. There is a conflict in the caf. Soxie can deliver the can to the police. ""Sixty-five cents."" Mary Nickerson sings for entertainment, the other join in. People throw bright new shiny silver coins. Nancy tells the newspaper editor what is happening. ""The story must be true, they printed it in the paper."" [Huh?]

Nancy tells the sergeant the story was designed to cause a crisis and catch the murderer. Note the disguise used by the sergeant. [Isn't that old woman too tall?] Was that legal wiretapping? The sergeant tosses the suspect's room. They are caught! Nancy gets an idea to get help. They get attention, and are released. Soxie meets Miles, they flee when they hear a police siren. But the police are in pursuit, and catch the pair. The loose ends are left untied. What about those Nickerson brats?

This is based on the Nancy Drew Stories by ""Carolyn Keene"", a popular series of adventure books from that era. This story may be more believable in a written format. What kind of novels are written for teenagers today?",1459382400,,2499,4.777777777777778

1197000,4,B000007QZN,"The second of only four Nancy Drew mystery films produced by Warner Bros.-First National in the late thirties, ""Nancy Drew ... Reporter"" is a fun filled delight.
Very typical of WB B-pictures of the period; this is a polished production, well-cast and cleverly plotted,  more than ably directed by William Clemens who helmed all films in the series and moves at a brisk pace.
Although based on ""Carolyn Keene's"" ever popular teenage characters, ""Reporter"" was an original story by Kenneth Gamet who also wrote the screenplay.
But obviously the key to making this film a constant pleasure is the magical casting of Bonita Granville as the feisty, persistent Nancy and Frankie Thomas, terrific as the often bewildered but good hearted Ted Nickerson. They play off each other beautifully and in this adventure they have the added bonus of solid support from John Litel as Nancy's father and two of the most loveable ""brats"" you'll ever see on the screen: Mary Lee and Dickie Jones.
The Alpha transfer is a bit on the ""soft"" side but shouldn't derive anyone from thoroughly enjoying this nifty little mystery adventure.  Just a pity that Warners didn't make more in the series!",1432944000,,1173,4.949238578680203

If a viewer is or was a fan of the original Nancy Drew series, or is a fan of thirties film efforts, this is worth having.",1224806400,,353,3.8493150684931505
1197109,3,B000007QZN,"The only reason I'm viewing and reviewing NANCY DREW... REPORTER is because I set up a Livejournal poll to determine which one dollar DVD I should select next.  The results were counted and the loser was me.

Before firing up the DVD player, I knew I would have a bit of a problem in my encounter with this work.  Mostly because I am not in the demographic that this film was initially aimed at.  In short, I am not a 13-year-old girl living in the late 1930s.  I mean, I'll try anything once, but I just doubt my ability to physically manage this one.

Prior to viewing, I did some basic research to determine if there were any familiar touchstones in connection with this film that I could cling to (translation: I wheeled around the Internet Movie Database for a couple of minutes, looking for names I recognized).  The director was not someone familiar to me.  William Clemens seems to have directed virtually the same film multiple times, with many of his movies having a similar plot summary to that which is described in his 1942 feature, SWEATER GIRL (the title sounds filthy, but the content probably isn't): ""College students attempt to solve a series of murders on campus while also trying to put together the school's big show.""  I didn't get much of a sense of Clemens' body of work, but I did get the impression that he was good at picking appealing titles for his movies: LADY BODYGUARD, THE CASE OF THE STUTTERING BISHOP, SHE COULDN'T SAY NO and THE FALCON AND THE CO-EDS, to name a few.

The information for the screenwriter was similarly unilluminating.  So turning to the actors, I looked up Bonita Granville who plays the eponymous character.  I was initially disheartened to see that her final filmed performance was as the uncredited role of 'Woman' in 1981's THE LEGEND OF THE LONE RANGER.  But further investigation revealed that she'd been nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Oscar just two years before NANCY DREW... REPORTER.

Slightly cheered by this information, I placed the DVD into the player, settled down on the loveseat and pressed 'play'.

It was only a few minutes in this movie featuring teenagers of an indeterminate age when I realized that this was indeed going to be silly enough to be enjoyable.  During a high speed chase sequence in front of an obvious rear-projection, Nancy spends as much time concentrating on the road as she does holding onto her hat.

The story concerns Nancy Drew becoming a reporter, as you no doubt have already guessed from the title.  The editor of the local newspaper has been talked into allowing a group of young people (each one with a massive floppy hat) to work for an unpaid stint of three days.  Whoever has written the best story at the end of the time will get a fifty dollar prize and a gold medal (although no promise is made of the article actually getting published).  Nancy doesn't have the biggest or the floppiest 1930s hat, but she's a young and plucky determined kid.  So she ditches her cheesy human interest assignment and shows up at an inquest.

After the results of the autopsy are broadcast, Nancy is the victim of a seemingly unconnected hit-and-run accident.  The conclusion of the subsequent chase sequence is the film's most shocking moment, in which it is revealed that fixing a broken bumper will set Nancy back three dollars and fifty cents.

At this point, we meet the three other main-ish characters: Ted Nickerson, her amiable, but dopey platonic boyfriend; Mary Nickerson, Ted's kid sister; and a child allegedly named Killer Parkins who is Mary's partner-in-crime (presumably his parents named him during Prohibition when they thought a henchman's life would be something positive that their baby could grow into).  I should admit now that I'm not extremely well versed in the Nancy Drew mythos so I'm not sure if these characters are from the books or are original to the film.  Further, I'm not sure if it really matters.

Also, I should take the opportunity to mention that because of the era's hair and clothing styles, all the kids look like they're in their early thirties including the children who are clearing counting their years in the single digits.  (This can be simultaneously humorous and creepy -- case in point, the scene where Nancy's father joyfully wrestles his daughter into bed.)  The hairstyles are so full that in one scene Nancy Drew successfully smuggles a 1930s camera into a jail in her hair.

The rest of the movie is full of the pleasant silliness one would expect from a teen-oriented mystery movie of the era.  There are dumb police officers, slow-talking heavies, blond molls and clueless adults.  At one point Nancy accidentally sends her hapless boyfriend into the ring with a professional boxer.  Later, Nancy, Ted and the two troublemaking kids are forced to sing for their dinner when they run short of funds (for some reason, a Chinese restaurant cheerfully accepts the customers singing jazzed-up nursery rhymes in lieu of cash).  There's even a police officer in drag, which had me scrambling back to the Internet Movie Database to fruitlessly search for a young Ed Wood in the credits.

If you're in a frivolous enough mood, then this is a decent, enjoyable film.  The thing to keep in mind is that it's very much of its time.  I'd recommend it if you enjoy eager, non-mentally taxing movies of this style and from this era.  On the other hand, if this description has you rolling your eyes in annoyance, then just stay away.",1221004800,,5480,4.765889830508475
1197110,4,B000007QZN,"Nancy Drew, Reporter (1939) is a very good entry in this series. I watched it for the first time the other night and was amused by two scenes with Psycho references. Since the movie was made over 20 years before Hitchcock's masterpiece, the scenes are pure coincidence, but worth sharing...during the movie, one of the characters appears in drag looking eerily like Mother Bates! and in another scene, which takes place on a rooftop, there is a sign in the background advertising the Bates Hotel!

1197111,4,B000007QZN,"Nancy Drew was and is an incredibly popular book series, but film makers knew a good story when they found one, and decided to make this one into a film series. Bonita Granville stars as Nancy, an excitable young girl who itches to solve mysteries. In this movie, she finds herself assigned to a childish topic when she volunteers to work for the local newspaper. She switches her topic with a real reporter's and finds herself listening to a murder trial. She believes the main suspect is innocent and does all she can to prove her theory, even if that includes involving her lawyer father and her boyish neighbor against their will. With run ins with boxers, photographers, and security guards, this movie keeps you on your toes.

This film is ideal for young audiences too because of the age of the main characters. There are several ""Golly""s and ""Gosh""s thrown into the dialogue which makes these teenagers seem a bit younger than they would be in today's world. However, a good mystery is suitable for all ages, just like this movie.",1183420800,3,1038,4.7032967032967035

7905220,5,B000007QZN,"I will forever love the four ""Bonita Granville as Nancy Drew films""! After skimming other reviews, I do agree that parts can be a tad silly - if you're an older audience wanting a classic crime noir movie, then this may not be your taste. Remember, Nancy Drew was just getting her start and was really popular with the younger girls back then! The first book came out in 1930 so this was Hollywood's [now-typical] effort to get some extra cash from a popular book series. They definitely made this a family-friendly movie that was very true to the times.

As for the Nancy-Drewness of it, Bonita Granville may not be the perfect actress [from that decade] to have played Nancy, but I do think she does a good job and the role goes against her then-normal ones of more bratty teens, so you still get a slight hint of that from her character. The movies do change some things from the books (such as Ned's name to Ted and and the housekeeper from Hannah to Effie); these things bothered me a lot when I first watched them when I was little (granted, I was reading a Nancy Drew book every day so I knew all the details!) but I can overlook them now that I have a better understanding that movies will never be as-good-as or the-same-as the books for any series!

My most important comment for anyone who is thinking about watching this (especially for a Nancy Drew fan, and even more especially for a younger fan who's perhaps only read the new books - yes, those yellow flashlight books have cut parts that were in the originally-published ones because some events/terms are no longer socially acceptable!): It's great to watch a Nancy Drew movie from the era that it is set in. I would love for a new Nancy Drew movie to come out that keeps her in that decade (versus the usual ones that make her modern), but it still would not be quite the same. There is something about the overall feel from it - plus Bonita doesn't have to ACT like a 30s teenager...because she actually was one! She doesn't look like she's wearing a costume, because I bet she personally owned outfits like the ones she had on!

Overall, if you are a Nancy Drew fan, you must watch all four of the Bonita-Nancy movies.",1513209600,2,2189,4.440298507462686

7905222,5,B000007QZN,"I'm a big fan of thirties and forties movies, though usually ones more important than this. But since it was on Amazon Prime at this time I wanted to see it as an example of what a B-movie for teens and kids was like in the thirties. I've seen a few films of the Dead End Kids but those had actors like Humphrey Bogart and jimmy Cagney in them so I don't think those would count. The same with MGM's Andy Hardy series and some of the Rooney/Garland films which were made for a more general audience I've also seen a few episodes of old serials of the period but those are just laughable, very brief cliff-hanging episodes shot with the Southern California desert standing in for Africa, Asia or another planet. Frankie Thomas, who plays Nancy's sidekick, Ted Nickerson, came out of one of these titled Tim Tyler's Luck.

Nancy Drew, Reporter is a step above those, a reasonably good-looking, competently directed studio product from Warner Brothers even though it is barely more than an hour long. Bonita Granville is a revelation; she's vivacious, energetic and spunky as Nancy Drew. I would compare her to Deanna Durbin in terms of being wholesome and fresh but without the singing. Frankie Thomas is brave and stalwart if often put-upon as her sidekick and seeming romantic interest. Everyone else is a supporting character and most play them well enough though Ted's younger sister and her friend were written as too obnoxious.

You have to give a lot of leeway for something like this which, after all, was written for kids. The villains would be twirling their mustaches if they had them, the legal case is overly circumstantial to begin with, and Nancy's lawyer father, city editor Bostwick and Police Detective Entwhistle are awfully accommodating to Nancy and her plans. Nancy herself is more scheming than I would have thought and openly lies when her fingers are crossed, but it's all in fun anyway. There's just no way to fairly apply the standards of a regular film to this and having not read the books have no idea how she stands up to the written character (not always a fair thing to do anyway).

It's breezy and moves along very fast with some really funny bits like Ted trying to pose as a boxer. I enjoyed the whole thing so much I ordered the entire series of four films so I could check them all out.",1500595200,3,2322,4.6174334140435835
