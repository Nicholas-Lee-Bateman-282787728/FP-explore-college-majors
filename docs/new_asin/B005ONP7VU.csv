4854071,5,B005ONP7VU,"Ordered this based on other reviews I read and I am glad I did. The character is a low key
person who peaks your interest and leaves you wanting more information. The stories kept my attention the entire time. Will look for more from this character. James Purefoy is great.",1350000000,2,273,4.48
4854072,5,B005ONP7VU,Have always liked James Purefoy movies and wondered if I would like a more contemporary one. I was realy pleased with the content of the movie and the quality of the DVD. Seeing a more English film was fun and the movie was great! I would watch it again.,1349136000,4,254,4.204081632653061
4854073,5,B005ONP7VU,"I was so pulled into this great story. I've always loved British drama and was not disappointed by this film! The story is very involved, but always easy to follow and really keeps you riveted to the screen! You feel strongly for the characters and the way the twists and turns are played out, and the way it ends, just magnificently done! I highly recommend this! And if you aren't a James Purefoy fan, this will give you a nice introduction to his presence on screen, his depth and character! He truly transforms.",1348531200,9,515,4.548387096774194
4854074,5,B005ONP7VU,"For all James Purefoy fans this is a MUST SEE!  Mr. Purefoy does an excellent job portraying barrister William Travers in 'Injustice.'.  If you loved the HBO Rome series, Ironclad, or Solomon Kane, you will see Mr. Purefoy in a new dramatic role and character that certainly won't disappoint any viewer. Very nicely pieced together thriller that I enjoyed watching from beginning to end. In fact, the entire cast I thought was brilliant.  When it comes to the UK, they certainly know how to make and create a TV series, not to mention the countless films that are so overlooked here in the US like Solomon Kane and Ironclad. I wish we had more TV and films like this in the US.  Mr. Purefoy gets a 5-star from me on this one!",1348531200,6,725,4.46969696969697
4854075,4,B005ONP7VU,"First the name caught my attention, then as I read that Anthony Horowitz had wrote and produced this mini series it was a must see.(Big fan of Foyle's War).
This series has many interwoven threads which keep you wondering and waiting what will come next. Even perhaps looking for another mini series.",1348185600,4,300,4.788461538461538
4854076,5,B005ONP7VU,"This is a gripping story where several threads are interwoven into a satisfying mystery yarn. I really like James Purefoy, and the rest of the cast is also excellent.",1347321600,23,166,4.758620689655173
4854077,5,B005ONP7VU,"Anthony Horowitz created, wrote, and produced this mini-series. It's a psychological thriller with layer upon layer of subplot, reminiscent of a best-selling novel. Horowitz was responsible for Foyle's War, Midsomer Murders, and much more. It was his name that caught my attention and inspired me to watch this 5-parter. It is really a 3  hour movie. It's great on DVD so you can begin at lunch and watch through till dinner (or supper till bedtime). But don't expect to be able to sleep immediately after watching this mind-twisting series. Whenever you start episode one, you'll not be able to stop watching till the end.

SUBTITLES provided for DVDs. TV airing June 2011
Episode 1: Defense Barrister Will Travers (James Purefoy-`Dance to the Music of Time') moves to the Suffolk countryside. Nice scenery, but too much action and flashbacks to enjoy the setting very long. Wife Jane (Dervla Kirwan) teaches to boys in a juvenile detention facility. Will is troubled over a violent past, exposed slowly via the flashbacks. His old friend Martin (Nathaniel Parker-`Land Girls') is arrested for murdering his lover/secretary (Jayne Wisener). Solicitor Miss Chandra (Sasha Behar) asks Travers to take the case after refusing murder defense for 2 years following a breakdown. Murders multiply. DI Wenborn (Charlie Creed-Miles) investigates with a grudge. He's ordered around by a nasty cop boss (David Schofield-`Land Girls' `Pirates of the Caribbean' `Blue Murder'). Multi-plots revealed.
___ 2: Travers gets the facts from his accused friend (but more there in the relationship to discover). And he recalls his night with the murdered Lucy (brief nude shot). He also explains his laptop disappeared at the same time, hardware owned by Qestrel Oil. A connection to the murder? Travers is stalked. Jane gets impressed with a lad's writing. Why was animal activist Spaull killed? Execution as DI Wenborn thinks? Wenborn's a man viewer's soon hate. Mental illness?
___ 3: `Agadir' begins to pop up in the wrong places. Wenborn's wife is arrested about the time he learns Travers has past case connections. Jane learns why her writing student is imprisoned. Prosecution barrister played by Nick Dunning (`Iron Lady' `Tudors').
___ 4: Murdered Lucy had form. Wenborn bullies a suspect about a gun. Again Wenborn looses control. There is a suicide now in the mix.
___ 5: A journalist's story becomes evidence. Qestrel Oil is involved. There's another attempted blackmail in this dramatic, dark, disturbing conclusion. Seems London law finds its own methods of justice.

Excellent, pieced together like a mystery/suspense novel with a not-the-normal end. One would expect no less from the greatness of Anthony Horowitz. The ending was left open enough for the possibility of another psycho-shot series of INJUSTICE. Let us hope",1341878400,41,2819,5.273942093541202

4854080,2,B005ONP7VU,"I enjoy James Purefoy, Dervla Kirwan, and Nathanial Parker in other roles and I like police/legal drams.  So I gave this one a try.  A complete waste of my time.  Despite Dervla/Jane not being cast as the usual flat, boring barrister's wife, this one never lived up to its potential.  This starts out as a taut legal/police thriller.  We have the good guy barrister, the vengeful crooked cop, and the old school friend in trouble.  But it ends up as if they ran out of time and had to wrap it all up in the last episode.  The evil DI is a joke of working-class stereotypes.  You just hate him and want him to die.
 Does he have a complex backstory or some hidden motivation?  No.  He's just a jerk.  The bad guy is really the bad guy, but not for the reasons you think, but for the same old reasons that make everyone the bad guy these days it seems.  And the subplot gets complete dropped after we insanely connect that guy to the murderer too.  It is as if someone wrote a very good first episode and then handed the rest to a bunch of 8th graders to finish for their creative writing project and they got a D.  It is so rife with clichs that you keep saying, ""No.  That has to be a cover for something else.""  But it's not.  It's just poorly written.  Anthony Horowitz really should finish a script before he starts filming it.  This one is crap.",1512777600,2,1349,4.2362204724409445

4854092,2,B005ONP7VU,"The first 3 installments are wholly entertaining in the best British fashion.  High production values, tight scripting, engaging characters, and top-notch performances.  But I felt something went awry as the series continued.  By the fourth episode it was as if there was a sudden realization that there wouldn't be enough time allotted to wrap up the series with the same care that was given to its beginning.  By the final episode it falls completely to ruin and what began so wonderfully in Episode 1 plummets into a woeful,  slipshod Frankenstein's monster seemingly cobbled together from equal parts  Perry Mason and Dexter Morgan.

What a disappointment.",1500768000,2,660,5.228571428571429

4854106,2,B005ONP7VU,"I didn't want to put any stars on this because my post is convoluted. Have a great deal of respect for the actors - brilliant. It was well directed BUT here's where it gets weird. If I take a  dislike to a role I just don't want to  watch the DVD. I watch a lot of mysteries, not too many thrillers as I think the state of the world is thriller enough. I absolutely hated the  Detective Inspector's role., HATED HIM. The only way I could watch it was to forward the DVD and do crosswords. He made my flesh creep which, I am told, is the sign of a brilliant actor. Not for me. Did I take the abuse personally? You betcha. I find a lot of these productions make the police look like a lot of thugs and this just isn't the case. I've worked on both sides of the challenge.  As a volunteer in a prison, and involved with the police in  a lesser capacity before I came to America. This brutality made me feel physically ill. What he did to Alan made me feel homicidal and he was so obviously racist. Of course his boss wasn't much better. Maybe I am nave but what I saw or tried to hide from in this DVD was the manner in which law enforcement was presented. It wasn't in the least entertaining. Some of my professional involvements are with veterans with PTSD which includes Law Enforcement, first responders. prison guards. I don't know any of them acting in such an unprofessional manner. I think it's a Brit thing. I am a Brit thing. I don't like it and of course I won't watch any more of these. I also work with the parents/families of murdered children so perhaps you can fathom how disgusted I was. In such cases, the police are magnificent with bereaved families and do their best to find the perpetrator. They are under strict supervision. I am sure there are bad apples as there are in any profession, my own included, but this kind of propaganda appalls me. I am now returning to watch the rest of it if I can and only hope that the ghastly Detective Inspector gets his desserts. That will make it worthwhile. I'd like his boss to get it too but that rarely happens in this productions as they want to keep the role going to torment others. To be brief...............UGH!",1479513600,3,2178,4.302439024390244

4854117,3,B005ONP7VU,"Just average. There are too many plausible inconsistencies. First and foremost, it is hard to suspend belief that Martin could have entered and left and entered and left again the 5 star hotel without any CCTV video footage. All hotels have cameras, especially 5 star hotels. That would have destroyed the missing time alibi.  I know it must be hard to write mysteries in today's world where all of our actions are tracked real time by cell phones, computers, and real time CCTVs,  forever saved in posterity by corporations and governments for eternity, but the unbelievable makes not a good mystery. This is especially true in England where CCTVs are everywhere now.

Material mystery problems aside, the main point of the film series seems to be that virtually no one is guilt free in that everyone is plausibly corruptible by the experiences of life. That's the nature of humanity. In that, the film succeeds.",1477353600,2,913,4.915584415584416

I intended to watch only the first episode and ended-up watching the entire first season in one go.  Mr. Purefoy is a bit more mellow than usual in this role (as befits his polished barrister character), but he's just as watchable nevertheless. I also really enjoyed the actor who played the DI -- he was such a harsh dude to so many people in so many scenes that I ended-up seeing him as comic relief. Great to see Nathaniel Parker (""Inspector Lynley"") as well. This is yet another high quality and masterfully-executed UK dramatic series with excellent cinematography, and I certainly hope the second season will be on Amazon in the near future.

And, yes, I get it that if you lie to your defense attorney and are guilty when you say you aren't, the story leaves you hanging with the idea that you will pay, and pay dearly, but I like that kind of ""injustice"", so I thought the ending was extremely  clever and very satisfying.

4854195,5,B005ONP7VU,"Possible spoilers: I found ""Injustice"" to be somewhat two thrillers blended into one episode of five series. Purefoy plays the paranoid Barrister Travers, bouncing back from a nervous breakdown, who refuses to take on murder cases unless he is certain of the clients's innocence, yet all is not as seems in his barrister mind. Travers' young son seems to be smarter than he is when Travers works on a case and usually ends up successful, yet his son was right, whereas his father ""missed it."" Then, of course Travers ""rights"" things, in his own mind, by taking out the client he defended and is now free. In among the twists and suspicions of suspense, we also have the genius, Detective Wenborne, with a terrible home life, created in part, by his career in investigation. Travers and Detective Wenborne never actually meet, although the two are drawn together via Detective Wenborne when he discovers the guilt of Barrister Travers in one of his own murder investigations. Unfortunately, an accident prevents Detective Wenborne from making his planned arrest of Travers--one day before the accident. Therefore; Travers is free to return to his home in London where he begins the same cycle of his past murder cases that caused his nervous breakdown in the first place. I found this ironic and he does it with a smile. There's great acting by all of the cast members. As brilliant as Barrister Travers is, he could never hold a candle to the clever genius of Detective Wenborne. I hope there's a second season that will continue and reveal Barrister Travers and his methods of practicing law.",1463184000,,1593,4.881918819188192

Who is on the right side of the law and who is not?  Well, in this series, it is often difficult to tell.  Even when the supposed ""bad guys"" are revealed, I found myself championing their causes and logic!  Twisted indeed!  Excellent acting layered with enigmatic plots...murder mystery meets dramatic thriller!  The lead character, Barrister Travers, played by Jame Purefoy, invokes a range of emotions from the viewer...sympathy, confusion, anxiety, and....wait for it....respect and empathy!

4854254,5,B005ONP7VU,"On the DVD cover of INJUSTICE it says, at the top of the box before the title, From the creator of Foyles War. That tells you something. The brilliant writer Anthony Horowitz, whose work on Midsomer Murders as well as Foyles War renders him one of the finest writers of television drama working in the industry today, provides a powerful script that is intricately plotted and perfectly balanced, sustaining its drama and tension right up until the end of the five episodes.

Led by James Purefoy, who will be familiar to audiences for a number of fine performances (and by this reviewer for his excellent portrayal of Beau Brummell), the acting is spot-on all the way down to the smallest of roles. This includes an essentially silent performance by a child actor who factors into the story in a way that will not be revealed here. Possibly the most interesting performance is by an actor not yet as well known, at least in North America  Charlie Creed-Miles  who plays a very colourful, hard-nosed investigating cop who crosses paths with Purefoys haunted lawyer William Travers. Also worthy of notice is Nathaniel Parker as the old friend of Travers who desperately needs his counsel in a murder trial.

The twists keep coming fast and furious in each of the five parts, each episode ending with a moment of revelation that keeps you watching in rapt anticipation of the next wow moment.

There isn't a flaw to be found in the execution of this superb drama which draws upon the best of legal and police dramas to fuel the story. Horowitz shows (as he has so often done in the past in his other work) that an intelligent script that keeps the audience guessing is the best drama there is. The violence is minimal (though a little gory) and there are no car chases in sight  just realistic, high-octane drama produced and performed to perfection.

James Purefoy is a great leading man, capable of portraying strength and vulnerability in equal measure. It must be remembered that he was highly touted to be the next James Bond, losing out to Pierce Brosnan initially, then later to Daniel Craig in Casino Royale. At the same time, Purefoy is outstanding in period pieces and one can only surmise that there is virtually no limit to his considerable acting range.

Brilliant script + Excellent leading man + solid production values and supporting cast = INJUSTICE. It will be a crime if you don't watch this one.",1397433600,2,2413,4.742243436754177

His work in POIROT, MIDSOMER MURDERS, and FOYLE'S WAR are well-known to Anglophiles who regularly watch those TV series. With the five-part miniseries  INJUSTICE Horowitz is not confined to continuing characters and constrained  to a pre-established plot-line formula. The story revolves around a barrister defending a colleague from a murder charge,, but Horowitz skillfully interwines fascinating character arcs, courtroom theatrics, police procedural routine while embellishing the tale with his characteristic sense of irony and moral ambiguity. that will please fans of courtroom drama. The always excellent James Purefoy (THE MAYOR OF CASTERBRIDGE and ROME) is the barrister and Nathaniel Parker (THE INSPECTOR LYNLY MYSTERIES) is his client.

4854271,1,B005ONP7VU,"In everyday life if you have not gotten enough of true ""injustice"" and want to watch plenty more morbid, disgusting, repulsive stories for ""entertainment,"" this is the show for you.

This show has many of the crazy Brit notions of ""entertainment"" that are appalling ~ an obnoxious, racist, bully police officer who is allowed to mistreat and abuse his subordinates and others. The subordinate talks to his captain about his foul behavior, and the captain says, ""...where does it say in the rule book you have to be nice. Speaking personally, I find you weak and disloyal coming here behind his back...""
There's the barrister, a tragic, unsympathetic character who starts taking the law into his own hands.
There's the poor, tortured, imprisoned young boy who has a hateful, psychotic mother who protects her psychotic lover at the expense of her son. He is continually victimized by the court system, the guards at the youth facility, and not one adult looks beyond their prejudices or self interest to see a boy drowning in the insanity of his mother's cruelty.

4854273,4,B005ONP7VU,"Let me begin by saying that I believe James Purefoy is a great actor. Anything that I see him in I automatically feel the need to watch , now that doesn't necessarily mean that everything he's in is up to his standard as an actor ( that retched series The Following, what a disappointment). But this series was actually good, not great, but it was entertaining.
Purefoy plays a lawyer who lives away from big city life after he defended a man of murder that he later finds out is guilty. You see that his character isn't all there, he seems to be seeing things and you come to the realization quite quickly that he has or had some sort of meltdown. He is called upon by a friend to defend him in a murder case, and he reluctantly accepts.
His wife is a writer that gives literature classes in a juvenile facility, there she meets a boy with great potential as a writer, and she decides on helping him in his search for a career as an author.
There is also a police officer investigating another murder that has a connection with the case that brought Purefoy's character to his breakdown.
The series consists of five episodes, each more interesting than the last. You have murder, intrigue, and a mystery. Now why don't I give it 5 stars, you might ask?
Well for starters it's all pretty predictable, not all of it but most of it. The coincedances with the wife, police investigation and the juvenile facility are a bit too much for my tastes.
But the biggest problem I had with the series was the investigating police officer ( who's a dead ringer for one of the guys in The Pet Shop Boys ) , he is just the least likable character in this. And I know you don't have to like every character in a movie, but it's frustrating when you take away from the action to show us his storyline. He is such a creep that if it has nothing to do with the plot, then I don't care to watch it. Because believe me at the end of the day, it has very little impact on the story, and going through the torture of watching this ass to have it come to nothing is just inconsiderate on the part of the filmmakers.
And another thing that bugged me was the incessant use of the scene in the first episode where someone is shot in the head, this scene is shown in every episode after that. In. Every. Episode. At least twice. We get it already. We're not idiots.
So if you want to be entertained watch it, it's not rocket science, and you will probably know how it will end, but I still believe it's worth watching for Purefoy alone. Now The Following, that's another story.",1374796800,5,2550,4.303534303534303

4854278,5,B005ONP7VU,"For those expecting another ""Foyle's War,"" from writer Anthony Horowitz, you're in for a surprise.  I'd say shock, but the story is so good and unpredictable you'll be captivated.  Twists and turns abound everywhere as the innocent become guilty and the guilty get their justice. The ending is a shocker.

My wife and I are fairly old-fashioned about ""R"" rated shows, but this one uses just enough sleaze to develop characters and tell a modern-day story.  The 5-part series, each episode running 44-45 minutes, starts off somewhat slowly but then the freight train starts rolling.  There are some far-fetched aspects in the premise, but we each give ""Injustice"" 5 stars out of 5.

It is a further mystery why this series was not on PBS as part of its ""Masterpiece-Mystery.""  One can only hope that it will in the future so that more people can enjoy the brilliance of its author.  Will a sequel be forthcoming?  That is another fervent hope.",1370044800,4,942,4.801242236024844
4854279,5,B005ONP7VU,"if you did not know who the star in this made for tv uk series was when originally made, most americans do today.  this is because he brilliantly played the serial killer villain with a cult following in the highly successful THE FOLLOWING shown on american tv in 2013.  kevin bacon plays the fbi hero but the villain in that series clearly has the role with wide, wide range.

he is just as good in this series as a London barrister who was forced to move to the countryside after having a mental breakdown.  this is because he is a brilliant murder defense advocate BUT he wants only innocent clients.  his clients lie to him, which is a well known aspect of being a criminal defense advocate.  thus, he has gotten guilty people off while thinking they were innocent. this is what drove him to the breakdown. a person with this problem should have never studied any form of law.  it is absolutely essential that professionals in law at all time recognize their role as advocates only and that the decision making is handled by judges and juries. unfortunately, he had an excellent aptitude and ability for the law despite this dreadful inability to not see himself also as judge and jury.

his coming back into the field to defend a friend from college accused of murder sets off this problem once again BUT this time he isn't the only person juggling the concept of truth and justice and their reverse, injustice and lies.  virtually every character in this series has his and her own crucible over these concepts.

this is a thinking person's mystery series.  if you want non stop action without any thoughtful handling of the nuances of the legal system, this is not for you.  if you want to see the law from every angle with a first rate cast, you can't do any better than this series.

4854287,4,B005ONP7VU,"I have to admit I almost stopped watching the series about half way into the watch. It was dragging and the storyline seemed boring, But I  gave it another try, and by the end of episode one, I was a believer.

James Purefoy  plays William Travers he is a good looking defense lawyer,  lives in Suffolk  and has a lovely family. Though on closer inspection, all does not seem right. It seems he has had a recent breakdown. A recurrent nightmare leads to the death of a man, though it takes two episodes to get us there. William's wife is teaching literature at the local boys reformatory, and has a special student that she may mentor.

Then there's DI Mark Wenborn, played by Charlie Creed-Miles who had a colleague who was crooked, and, now Charlie's a mean man, not liked by anyone. He has his eyes on Travers and that can't lead to anything good.

One of Willam's old school friends has been arrested for murder, and he has requested William as his barrister. This means William will need to return to London, the scene of his breakdown. Most of the story is told in flashbacks, and it is interesting, indeed, to look at the evidence and clues as they accumulate. This has turned into a well planned and laid out series. They may want to look at the first half of episode one and beef it up, it almost lost me.

4854292,3,B005ONP7VU,"I've got to admit that I got this without even knowing what it was about because James Purefoy is in it. This was not his most impressive hour (because of the character, not his acting), but it was okay.

The formula is typical British soap opera style where you have all these seemingly unrelated characters and plots going on that converge at the end. There is a big reveal and the viewer let's out a sigh of understanding and awe of brilliant, creative story-telling - except that it's not all that brilliant. I generally like the formula and am usually delightfully surprised. However, not this time. There are things that weren't wrapped up, which leads me to wonder if that was done purposefully to leave room for a part 2. There were questions about what was real and what was fantasized as part of a nervous breakdown. Much of it was predictable. Worst of all is the big speech at the end that tells us what happened. Ugh! Did we go all that way for that?

Still, it's a lot better than what American TV is producing these days. Given that, I'd say it was a worthwhile effort, but not great. If you like British tv, you will probably find it at least okay. If not, you will probably find it slow and predictable.",1359244800,16,1220,4.441964285714286

4854304,5,B005ONP7VU,"Although Horowitz created this series, I swear I saw the ghost of Hitchcock pacing in the background. Eerily, his prints hoovered just off the pages of script, evident in pacing, tone and tenor and I wonder if the honourable he and Mr. Horowitz wrote the denouement in one mind.

Yes, Purefoy (Travers) was excellent as a the subdued, yet stalk-on rigorous attorney, eying both the prosecution and his client throughout the trial.  Moreover, the flashbacks of life before rural Suffolk, as well as the choppy shots of the murder of Spaull, were done in a coherent, easy manner with which to keep pace.  The insinuations of a 'breakdown' in Travers' past was another great possible portent of pitiful prospects that sent tingles up my spine.  Was he going to fall apart and go on a spree, will it come off short, constrained by the so-called British sangfroid? And again my thoughts returned to Hitch, who could have only contributed to this series through the breath of his spirit and his lasting influence on a talented Horowitz.  Hitch was admittedly afraid of many things, in fact, he once said ""The only way to get rid of my fears is to make films about them.""

 The support actors were brilliant! Dervla Kirwan is always spot-on. Although I have never watched Charlie Creed-Miles before, I can honestly say, I just hated him in such a good way!  Can't wait to see him in something else.

In conclusion, this is a great UK miniseries with 5 episodes that keep one interested and, I would say, entertained.  Give it a watch, you'll have no regrets.",1353715200,2,1551,4.711111111111111

I was completely absorbed and enjoyed every minute.
Keep them coming!",1529625600,,143,5.545454545454546

8481624,2,B005ONP7VU,"The closed captioning was so bad, at times completely ignoring bits of sentences. Words misspelled, timing way off, etc. Impossible to feel involved in the plot as I would find myself (for example) suddenly realizing ""Aha!!! Aratraya must mean Eritrea!"" and laughing at how long it took me to figure that one out. At times even the names of the characters were misspelled. If it was done by a computer, update the software. If it was done by humans, send them back to elementary school.",1522281600,,486,4.729411764705882
8481625,5,B005ONP7VU,"Wonderful!  So well written and acted, and we know the people quickly and well, which makes it so tense. Masterfully done.",1521676800,,122,4.809523809523809

8481627,2,B005ONP7VU,"We could have passed on this one.  Its rather far fetched and what we found increasingly aggravating were the chronic flashbacks which movie makers like to utilize for added ""artsy"" attempts.  It didn't work for us and the fast forward was a relief through much of the flashbacks.  A disappointment overall and story content could have used a bit more work.",1520208000,,357,4.819672131147541

8481629,5,B005ONP7VU,Rich characterization and some outstanding atmosphere and performances make this a winner. I thoroughly enjoy British legal dramas and the premise behind this one brings an intriguing hook. I hope they bring us season 2 and beyond.,1518307200,,231,5.27027027027027

8481631,3,B005ONP7VU,"Some characters get treated better (well more subtly) than others.  The main guy, his wife, pretty much everybody except the main copper.  Every time he's on screen I wanted to shut the show down.  He's an a-hole, yes we get it, no need to pound it into us every single scene.  He doesn't have a single redeeming quality and that makes him hard to believe in.  Even the most psychotic sociopaths are able to at least fake being human beings for extended periods of time.  This dude had no notes other than the one note and it was irritating to have to stomach him through an otherwise decent thriller-drama.  It was enough for me to bust it down from 4 stars to 3.

Best part of the whole thing?  Every time Dervla Kirwan was on screen.  She was not the only one to do a good job by far, but it felt special.",1515542400,,808,4.222222222222222
