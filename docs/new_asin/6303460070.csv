7848363,4,6303460070,A good look at a greatd ballplayer and a good man. Aaron was rather unassuming while in the public eye as he knew people were watching him - closely. He managed to have a stellar career while avoiding controversy; yet he knew when it was time to speak up. This film documents that reality rather well. Definitely worth a look.,1484697600,,326,4.45
7848364,5,6303460070,"In my mind, Henry Aaron is still the all-time leader in career home runs, even though he has seven fewer than Barry Bonds.  Bonds no doubt took HGH and steroids.  Bonds has walked more times than any player in history, which gave him fewer good pitches to hit and took the bat out of his hands.  It can be argued that if he had more chances to hit away, he would have hit maybe 850 home runs.  Even if this would have played out, I still think Aaron is the all-time leader.  Now about the video...

This video is a documentary on the life and baseball career of Hank Aaron.  Starting from his youth when he was a child up to the present day (then 1995), there is a treasure trove of old actual footage mixed with re-enactments.  The re-enactments were very well done and believable.  You'll learn that Aaron grew up a Dodgers fan and idolized Jackie Robinson and was very disappointed when Bobby Thomson hit his ""shot heard 'round the world"" in 1951 to defeat his Dodgers.  This video goes into a lot of interesting detail about Aaron's life and playing career, including his involvement in the civil rights movement in the 1960s and the aftermath of Dr. Martin Luther King's death.  There are many interviews with many players he played with and against.  The jist of the video, to summarize, is how Aaron overcame incredible odds to surpass Babe Ruth's all-time career home run record of 714.

At the end of the video you'll see Barry Bonds talking about how Aaron's record of 755 home runs is unreachable.  But that's another story.",1255910400,,1535,4.534545454545454

He overcame so much Hatred for breaking a Record.he  Paved another road after the one set before him.not that he broke Babe  Ruth's number but the fact that he was a Black Man doing it caused the  maddness. He is a Hero.",967248000,4,363,4.538461538461538
