355751,2,6301758110,"We rented this last night, paid the premium for it being offered early, wish I could have a do-over on that.  I know that Terrence Malick often makes some really different films, and I skipped watching the Tree of Life because of what some reviewers said about it, that it had really beautiful cinematography, but that there wasn't a cohesive story there, or it was just wierd.  Well that was certainly the case with 'To the Wonder', it was way wierd.  The people talk to each other very, very little in this film.  It's composed mainly of the five main characters just being filmed in different locations, walking, jumping, rolling around, but not talking.  So you see them doing different things, but you wonder why they are doing that, and there is no answer, you're just supposed to see it, and that's it.  So we watched the whole thing, and then said ""what did we just watch""?  Save your money folks unless this sort of movie does it for you.",1365984000,2,947,4.535294117647059

Open Window

How would it be if you appeared
in this open window?

It would be as though my hands and feet
were suddenly untied, and life was pouring
back in.

I would say, I have not smiled
or laughed since you left.

Wine has had no effect.

And you would tease,""such melancholy"".
It may be catching.

Then I would wrap my shroud around
and offer my neck to your blade.

Cure this headache permanently.
You are the soul light in my eyes.

Words drift out in the air.
Let the musicians play now.
The stringed instruments, the tambourine
and drum.
Since no reed flute is here today.

355754,5,6301758110,"Terrence Malick's new film To The Wonder was released on the same day in select theaters across the U.S., but more significantly, on Video On Demand (VOD) and online so that you don't have to wait three or four months for it to come out on DVD or Blu-Ray, but can stay at home and watch it in HD and the comfort of your own home -- all for a mere $7.99 or $6.99 -- less than the price of a single ticket at the cinemas.

This is a radical move, to bypass a theatrical release. But this works for this type of film, I believe, because the same-day limited release in theaters generates same-day reviews across the country and could result in great VOD traffic. This could be a new strategy for independent films.

This is only fitting because this is such an intimate, personal film -- or experience -- that to share it in a dark auditorium with total strangers seems to be the antithesis of this film.

I watched it on On Demand in HD and I found it to be, like all of Terrence Malick's films, a deeply internal experience. You're and constantly being pulled in several directions:

1) You're never sure what's going on in a Terrence Malick film; yet you're assured that it's a steady hand that's riding the keel. A Malick film is a journey -- you go with it. It's the same sort of experience or sensation that you have when you're watching a Stanley Kubrick film for the first time. The story and the meaning is never obvious or written out. It's something that seeps into you.

2) I keep using the word ""experience"" because that's so much of what a Malick film is. He's never followed traditional linear storytelling. He has his own entirely unique voice. And that's what a filmmaker has to have to stand above the rest and be unique. It's more sensory. More emotional; and not gut-wrenching and buckets of tears emotional--internal conscious thoughts-at-work emotional.

3) It's mind-numbing and awe-inspiringly beautiful. Every shot -- every single image -- is to die for. And all -- ALL -- are shot in NATURAL LIGHT!!!  Every shot backlit. To bring that final message home I found myself compelled to pick up my pocket camera and shoot these handful of photos off the screen. And these don't do To The Wonder justice.

Emmanuel Lubezki deserves a special American Society of Cinematographers achievement award for this work. (Of course, that won't happen. It will go to another all digitally composited film as it has for the past three years with Avatar, Hugo, Life of Pie.)

So often you hear filmmakers say words to the effect of, ""We didn't want to talk about the subject of the movie -- we wanted to talk around it."" In Terrence Malick's universe, the actors barely talk at all, unless it is in Voice Overs of the thoughts of the characters are posing in questions to themselves. This could sound absurd in another filmmaker's film, but in a Terrence Malick film it's expected. And it's brilliant!

Any other film is told in a story and you can almost see the screenplay's scene cards pinned onto the screen. In To The Wonder Malick doesn't even seem to bee shooting the scenes. Instead, he shoots everything that happens between the scenes. This could be frustrating for some traditional movie watchers. For me, however, I'm always watching movies in search of something new and different and original. To The Wonder is that film.

Yet you sense, from images that you can relate to like recognizing similar snap shots from moments in your own life of knowing happiness, love, resentment, doubt, loss.

There is a bigness and an emptiness to the film -- and this, I am certain, is intentional. Everything in Oklahoma is Big. The houses are Big. The rooms are Big. The skies are Big. The streets are wide. The rooms are spare, if not devoid of furniture. The people seem almost lost in it all, there is so much space between them. I believe that Malick is trying to say that there is an emptiness in the characters lives. And everyone is seeking love, either the love of another person or for the love of God to be returned, and that the vastness and emptiness in these places represents the space that the characters are hoping to be filled up with love.

I can't help but think of the connection between this film and Malick's film from -- years ago The Thin Red Line. While that was a film set in World War Two, at its essence was a story about people that were all strangers in a strange land. The Americans and the Japanese they were fighting couldn't be more different from each other -- totally separated by language, race, culture. The Americans fearing death and the Japanese preferring death to surrender. They could have just as easily be aliens from another planet, a variation on War of the Worlds.  Also, the Japanese from the northern Pacific and the Americans from North America being brought to do combat on a harsh tropical island (Guadalcanal) in the Southern Hemisphere, which both armies were complete strangers to.

The story takes place in Paris and Oklahoma. Ben Affleck meets Olga Kurylenko in Paris and brings her back to his home in Oklahoma. Life is happy and playful, but then the realities of being back in his world and at work set in. Domestic bliss gives way to mutually dissatisfied dreams and disillusionment. Then another woman from Affleck's youth, Rachel McAdams, comes back into his life. There is rekindled love. But love, like flowers, bloom and fade.

Ben Affleck has hardly any on-camera lines in the film. Yet you always seem to know where he is in his life. He seems like a man who doesn't fit in on his home turf. Is much more comfortable being somewhere else, in this case Paris, where he can be who he really feels like he is inside or can be free to be somebody else. When he returns with his French love to Oklahoma, she no longer fits in. And he doesn't really seem to want to be there either.

He begins seeing Rachel McAdams, an Oklahoma girl who works horses on a family ranch. There is happiness there. But Affleck is a wrestless spirit.

Perhaps his character is a romantic adventurer -- someone for whom every new love is like an around-the-world cruise filled with discovery, passion, zest for life. But, ultimately, you have to return home and there is always an eventual letdown that the trip is over -- back to the real world and who you really are.

I felt that I could relate to all the characters on each of their levels. That's the genius of Terrence Malick's films: By not clearly defining the characters (I don't even think they address each other by name) they are open-ended enough to be malleable and easy to impose our own thoughts, feelings, recolections.

Mixed into this is Javier Bardem as Catholic priest who is new to a parish and trying to reach out and fit in. But he is conflicted about being a stranger in a strange land. His internal voice speaks in Spanish to God, searching for answers. He believes in God, but he seems to be asking God to tell him that He believes in the priest.

There's a poignant scene where the priest conducts a wedding ceremony, then afterwards the family and guests are rejoicing and shaking hands and talking with one another -- everyone is paired up -- and Javier Bardem is walking through them alone. He's seeking God's love and wisdom, but you sense he fears that he is walking in a Godless emptiness.

This is Malick's first film set in the contemporary world, rather than the 17th century, the turn of the 20th century, the 1940s or 1950s.

I have no idea how this film started out on the written page. I could not imagine it as a screenplay. I could see it more as being drawn from the pages of a treatment. Or a novel. Or a poem. Because this is a visual poem.
Roger Ebert's final review was for To The Wonder. If this was the last movie he saw, I think he passed away happy. And, with the underlying sense of nature and spirituality in the film, with a sense of contented grace.

After watching a Terrence Malick film, it stays in your system. You feel content not to speak. Your mind is swirling with thoughts. You see the world from the perspective of a Steadicam Point-Of-View shot. And your ears are filled with the sound of string instruments and ethereal classical music.

This all sounds quite heavy and gloomy. And . . . well . . . yes . . . heavy, it kind of is. But, ultimately, in my view, To The Wonder is a sermon. A journey of various characters who are seeking love, and forgiveness, in their own way. A man seeking the love of a woman . . . even though he may not know which woman that is. Of a woman for a man, with all his faults. That none of us are perfect. That we are all flawed creatures and we must strive to build the best life that we can with what is available to us. Of the love of a man for a God that he is not certain is listening. Yet, even though he is reaching out in the darkness, he still does not give up hope that there is a God -- of some sort -- out there. And that we are all a part of something greater than ourselves. A universal goodness. That we are all connected. Albeit tenuously at times. I came away from To The Wonder with a sense that, if there is in deed a Heaven, then perhaps, for better or worse, it is here on this Earth and within our fingertips, if we will only accept it.

(Please NOTE: I am not addressing or espousing any specific religious belief, but a great, broad, all-encompassing and extremely esoteric and non-denominational spirituality.)
And whatever you may take away from To The Wonder, if you can ever come across 112-minutes of cinema that generates this type of intellectual stimulation, combined with incomparable beauty in every single shot -- and without digital compositing -- isn't that worth $7.99 in itself?

Thank you, Terrence Malick. And thank you, To The Wonder.",1365897600,65,9775,4.507909604519774
355755,3,6301758110,"A lesser Malick film is still a good film, but in this film, only the smallest thread of a plot is left. Little bits and trails of dialog are used or not, but are all but meaningless. There is little character development, but hints at character as our main character, a sad, bipolar(?) woman played by Olga dances and twirls through everyday life.
I admire what Malick is doing in this film, showing us little impressionistic bits of life and love, interspersed with narrative and peppered with beautiful scenery. It's the same style that worked, in my opinion, quite well in The New World, Thin Red Line and even Tree of Life. The problem here is this time, Malick has completely eschewed a script and the movie falls flat and although it's beautiful to listen to and look at, there is very little connection.
I would recommend this to fans of cinema and Malick, although be forewarned this is a very Malickian movie, very un-Hollywood.",1365724800,8,938,4.6909090909090905

Deeply complex and even courageous (for a film in our present day) religious overtones.  It's a dream, it's a story, it's a lament, it's a poem and it's a prayer.  You'll either drink it in and be absorbed from the beginning or it'll strike you as a piece of arch cinematic noodling.  I watched it over the course of several sittings -- it may be a little too much to fully appreciate or absorb in a single uninterrupted dose.

356023,2,6301758110,"This movie has nothing to do with Christianity or love.  The director/writer express hatred and disdain for both. Rule one- relationships are not built romantic love.  The priest should have told Ben: Jeremiah 17:9 (KJV) 'The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?'  The main female character who believes in romantic love and desires spiritual love of a husband to a wife is embodied in this woman with an undiagnosed mental illness. Ben Affleck's character, an expression of physical love, is represented by a man suffering from  some low level depression having great stress dealing his job an environmental inspector talking to and seeing the lives of the impoverished desperate people being poisoned in town(s) by faceless corporation(s). So Ben Affleck's character finds this child like woman to play with for a while as a means of escape. He abandons her when this method of escape starts to wear off and/or not work, and picks up with a childhood friend.  This woman is more grounded but has too much real life personal sadness for him to be bothered. He drops the new chick for the old chick with a marriage proposal so void of love (almost casual interest) that a mail ordered bride would think twice about before accepting. Affleck's character goes through the motions of emotional, romantic love, but he doesn't know how to be in love or give it. French woman (Marina) abandons her own daughter to the biological father after being dumped by Affleck the first time. Who would still want to marry a woman too unstable to care for a kid because you dumped her?  This movie is an indictment against family, love, responsibility, integrity, womanhood, manhood and really common sense. This movie embraces mental illness by normalizing the juvenile thoughts in this woman's head by making it sound like pretty romantic poetry. Let's not forget about the priest who is having a crisis of faith, as you do when you're a Catholic priest in a Hollywood movie. This priest needs a sabbatical or new profession. This movie has nothing to do with adult love or people struggling to have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ or incorporating divine love in their relationships. This movie is beautifully and artistically shot. The director tells the story more with the scenery to compensate for the limited dialogue and does it very well.  The score is as impressionistic and the scenes, the silence and lack of dialogue  are poignant and revealing. The visuals are romantic and sometimes the scenes are tragically saturated in sharp greys near black and white lighting to express bleakness--Ben's character.

This isn't a painting to be gazed at, it's a movie....which ought to, well, move.  The sweeping scenes, romantic frolics and whispered narration of the characters' inner thoughts quickly become grating rather than illuminating or artsy.  If one more person started strolling through a field of tall grass I thought I would scream.  And then someone did, but by then I already was playing a game on my tablet to keep the mind working, so screaming wasn't necessary.  A little simple dialogue would have been wonderful - not a lot, just enough to keep the film progressing, raise the decibel level a little, wake the viewer up....

357426,5,6301758110,"People are constantly criticizing about this movie not having a concrete story. I agree but since I already had a feeling that it would be, I was already prepared.
Since the movie <Thin Red Line> the director Terrence Mellick's world becomes all about poetic cinema. The movie that has to do with showing beauty with narration to explain or match the imagies he is showing. The acting and storyline is there all right but is not very intensive and it is rather very loosen so most of the audiences who are used to Hollywood style movies will fall asleep or turn off the movie during watching it.
But when you understand his new world since his movie <Thin Red Line> it is really a great pleasure to watch his cinema. It is like feeling a long long poet with a beautiful music combined with beautiful actors in it as well.
When I first saw <Thin Red Line> I really felt the chill from the inside. It really showed so well the meaning of HOW CAN THE MEN SO BRUTALLY DESTROY THE NATURE THAT GOD CREATED? With the Faure's Requiem combined, the pinnacle moment was the scene when the soldiers are invading this neighbour where everyone in there were dead.
Since then his movies has minimal dialogue and all about narration and images.
This movie is also the same.
It has all kinds of beautiful images include the most beautiful shots of Olga Kuryleko and Rachel Mcadams' nudity. See, from the movie Ring Finger, the movie based on the Japaese novel that was made in France, Olga was fully exposed full nudity but at that time she was not at all sexy or beautiful at all. It was just ok, she was naked? Kind of attitude. What I wanted to say is, it depends on the director that how the actors look. True beauty is created by it's creator.
In this movie TO THE WONDER, OLGA is never been beautiful before. Even a small nudity looked like goddess.
The camera angle, the light exposure and everything makes her so supreme being.

The images really stayed in my mind is Olga dancing .constantly round and round in the outside with her both arms spread. It seems so cheerful and makes me smile.
Also her daughter is so cute who is also very happy girl in this movie. She is not in the screen all the time and it was only a brief moment but she made the movie really shine.

And of course the Rachel Mcadams was never been prettier. She was like a youngest then ever. She was acting as Ben Affleck's former girlfriend. Flashback of his past.

The movie itself as I mentioned is like a long poetry. If you are ready to watch it that way, it will be a great present for you.

In some way in a much different way it kind of related with other movies like <VALERIE AND A WEEL OF WONDER 1970> It was a most beautiful movie I've ever seen.",1460851200,,2721,4.3609467455621305

This film is about seeking through doing; our very existence. So, if you want the I.T. film of the year where you will feel safe and predictable, don't watch it; but if you have ever taken a long walk in nature or traveled after deep loss or even triumph; then see it.",1459814400,13,713,4.25
357428,5,6301758110,"This is by far the most spectacularly beautiful film I have ever seen.  In all its muddled, confusing, frustrating pretentious chaos, it spoke to me on a level that I don't think any other movie ever has.  Some of the cinematography literally made me gasp wide-eyed. It was just stunning. Unbelievably stunning.

Understand though, that this is not a movie like you are used to seeing.  The experience of watching To the Wonder is more like going to the opera, orchestra or (perhaps closer) the ballet.  There is a bare plot that meanders through the two hour running time, but no real dialogue or structure.  That's just not the point of the thing any more than looking for the plot in a visit to a museum.  The only movie I can compare it to is The Tree of Life, another of Malick's creations that was the subject of huge polarization, though (to me) this one exceeded The Tree of Life in almost every way.

One of the only complete trains of thought in the entire movie, a profoundly moving statement by Father Quintana, a Catholic priest in rural Oklahoma suffering with and (I guess it could be interpreted against) his faith:

""We wish to live inside the safety of the laws. We fear to choose. Jesus insists on choice. The one thing he condemns utterly is avoiding the choice. To choose is to commit yourself. And to commit yourself is to run the risk, is to run the risk of failure, the risk of sin, the risk of betrayal. But Jesus can deal with all of those. Forgiveness he never denies us. The man who makes a mistake can repent. But the man who hesitates, who does nothing, who buries his talent in the earth, with him he can do nothing.""",1459728000,,1648,4.4485049833887045

357640,4,6301758110,"Malick's movie is like John Dunne's devotional poetry, except instead of rigid verse, Malick uses voice overs and images, like the stairs that suggest  our efforts at transcendence, or the priest's gorgeously filmed attempts to love and serve the sick, the poor, and the suffering and to find God through them. Both Dunne and Malick are technical virtuousos, but being tired, I have to say that Dunne has the major advantage of bundling his songs of faith into fourteen lines, while Malick takes two hours. I waited for this movie end like a disconnected lover waiting for a partner's panting finish. I guess To the Wonder is about the inability to love more than anything, and in that maybe my response is symptomatic of the problem Malick is looking at. In any event, I watched This Is 40 last night, which dealt with the same theme, really, in a different way--and with more humor, but less moral rigor and visual virtuosity--and I enjoyed it more.

357642,5,6301758110,"I have given this film 5 stars, not because it is an excellent movie in any usual sense, but because it is excellent as what it actually is. To the Wonder is of course very beautiful. Malick is in love with light and finds unusual ways to use it as different as clouds reflected on water, a candle flame, or a spinning cut glass ball. He is also famous for combining a beautiful sound track with the lowest forms of human conduct.

For those people who made comments that the film is a mess or unstructured or have tried to label it as a poem in an effort to make it conform to a comprehensible genre, I will try to show that To the Wonder is actually highly structured, but not in ways most viewers will easily be able to see. There is also the fact that Malick's films are increasingly evolving into conceptual art and very close to surrealism. Conceptual art, usually unorthodox, is concerned with expressing ideas important to the artist, but making it comprehensible to an audience is a secondary concern, if a concern at all. If Malick had wanted to make this film readily understandable he would not have used four languages, five if you include sign language. Other examples of conceptual art are Charles Ives' music and Picasso's Les demoiselles d'Avignon.

The structure of To the Wonder is a very good basic expression of Soren Kierkegaard's existential philosophy of the human condition. Very simply Kierkegaard saw people falling into three personality types. Marina (Olga Kurylenko) is the ""aesthetic"" type governed by the senses, impulse, and emotion. Neil (Ben Affleck) is the ""ethical"" type which is motivated by responsibility and social good. What job could be more ethical than an EPA inspector? Father Quintana (Javier Bardem) is the ""religious"" type, although a failed or relapsed type. For  Kierkegaard the religious personality required a total self-relating to God, and it has to be constantly repeated. This is why  Father Quintana struggles all through the film with self-doubt. He thinks in voice over, ""Love is a command and a duty. You say I can command my emotions. You fear your love has died."" Important to existential philosophy is that every person has freely chosen his life condition and can change it. Although miserable to the point of despair, people rarely find a way out of their life condition because it requires a complete, active break with their past personality type. (Cf. ""Fear and Trembling"" and ""Either Or."") Each character plays out their personality in spite of the conflicts and misery it causes, and each character ends the film essentially unchanged. It is inevitable that as soon as the first joys of new love fade, Marina and Neil are too different to stay together. She is soon bored with him, ""don't be so serious"" she says. Neil on his part is exasperated with her impulsive, irresponsible personality.

Because Malik is dealing here almost exclusively with abstract ideas, he has eliminated most of the dialogue and uses symbols instead. One is a flight of ascending stairs. It could be escape, fulfillment, hope. He shows Marina and Neil pacing around the same house, but on different floors. They can not come together, physically or mentally. He has also stripped the plot down to the barest minimum. He is trying to cover a lot of psychological ground and avoiding another three hour film like The Tree of Life. He uses a lot of cinema montage, a series of short shots of actions or people's expressions to tell the story without words. Yes, there is too much twirling, but what action better shows joy in such a quick, simple way? This type of filmmaking requires a lot attention from the audience. I didn't get it all the first time either.

The end of the film, starting with the first scenes in the airport when Marina is leaving, are the most difficult because Malick here abandons a linear time sequence. This section can best be considered a series of memories, regrets, expressions of despair, or of desire. In a voice-over Marina says, ""Weak people never bring anything to an end themselves. They wait for others to do it."" Pure Kierkegaard. Then she is shown committing adultery which she knows will cause Neil to leave her. There never could have been a baby or young child while she was still in Kansas. Perhaps she wished her daughter was still young and not estranged  from her. The scene of Neil with his attorney explicitly states the divorce  will be easy since there are no children. The scene of Neil with a young boy is his wish for a son. The last scene with Marina back at Mont Saint-Michel with the same music as the first time is her memory of lost love. This scene also brings the film full circle to the beginning, indicating that nothing in these people's lives has really changed because they have not changed.

Malick has probably thought about this film most of his life. He did post graduate study at Oxford on the human condition as expressed in the philosophy of Kierkegaard, Wittgenstein, and Heidegger. Over laying this philosophical structure are loosely autobiographical events in Malik's own life. He left his first wife to marry a woman he met in Paris with whom he lived for a time in Kansas. He later divorced her. (Wikipedia) Malick did not make this film for you or me. He made it for himself, and it is a very personal expression of his thoughts on the human condition and spirituality. This is why Roger Ebert could write, ""Malick...appears almost naked here before his audience.""",1436054400,18,5491,4.7776606954689145

Perhaps the non narrative style just doesn't translate as well when dealing with a much smaller story.

Rated R.
Terrence Malicks films are hard for most people to stay with because they do not follow the usual 3-act narrative of the typical film. Like his Tree of Life, this film will be confusing at times, the scenes, though beautifully photographed, seeming far too random. The stories, such as they are, deal with a young couple falling in and out of love and a compassionate priest going through what the ancient fathers called the desert of the soul as he struggles to feel the presence of God. There is very little dialogue among the characters, most of the words that we hear being the inner monologue of the characters as they wonder about existence and meaning. Best parts are the insights on love and commitment that we hear in snatches of the priests sermons.",1419120000,10,782,4.633093525179856

There are no doors slammed shut on the experiences of the characters in this film, only moments of disclosure, moments of being called, and moments of light.",1417564800,3,556,4.802083333333333

The ""dialogue"", mostly internal monologue, to me, is always emotionlessly, whisper-like, throughout.
This movie is practically spoken in 3 different languages (English subtitles included):  French, which is the predominant, spoken by Olga Kurylenko, throughout the entire film; then Spanish, which is when, a very Spaniard Javier Bardem, the minister (in an ALL Anglo parish!), steps in.  Yes, Ben Affleck does have things to say, once in a while. In English, of course.
Olga Kurylenko, is a French woman/mostly child-like, (EMPHASIS ON CHILDISH -which got to the point of annoyance!)  that is ""totally and irrevocably in love"" (in the infamous words of Bella Swan -Twilight) with her lover Ben Affleck, in which in my opinion, does not reciprocate, so totally or irrevocably.  Which I honestly do not blame.
Voila!  Rachel McAdams, the other woman.
Bardem is another, in a constant, internal monologue, agonizing over  love loss in his lonely life,
This movie begins in France, and ends up in, not sure what state in the U.S. -Texas, maybe?

TO THE WONDER reveals the missing spiritual elements in the life of a man unable to find peace, understanding and meaning to his existence. It's not enough to just have beautiful woman come into your life and the two actresses in TO THE WONDER are by every standard exceptionally lovely. The man in this films has no clue about the purpose of life. Is it to only have a season of great love and then when that reaches a high point and diminishes to move on? The disillusioned Priest in the film is easier to understand. It would be very difficult to walk among the day to day hardships of the people in his parish and keep a positive outlook on life.

358055,2,6301758110,"After watching this movie (and having seen 'The tree of life' and 'The new world') I suppose that Romance is not a genre that fits Terrence Malick well.
Though Malick shows romance with his typical and admirable abilities, which indeed provide us with some unusual and valuable shades of experience, as a whole the romance does not appear round or real or believable enough to me.
Probably, his female lead often possessing archetypical qualities (and lacking in earthliness and autonomy) has something to do with this. Also some of his abilities he does not proportion well, overexposing us with some typical Malick-images.

Yet, I believe archetypical qualities, a dreamlike or contemplating atmosphere, and spirituality can be combined - also in a romantic context - with a certain groundedness, a sense of concrete and raw reality. I do admire Malick's evocation of spirituality but this spirituality is not earthly in the sense of having harmonized with modern daily life. Reality remains largely compartmentalized into an acknowledged spiritual domain and a mainly disenchanted modern life. And his main characters seek to reunite these.

The fusion of these two domains (the spiritual and the daily) is portrayed cinematically far more succesful (than in the romantic storylines) in the storylines that focus upon finding meaning and/or spirituality, like the storyline with the priest in this movie, and more evident in 'The tree of life'.
I felt the storyline with the priest was too underdeveloped or could be more articulated.

One thing which bothered me in this movie is that Neil is left so undetermined. I think this is partly so because this movie is quite autobiographical and Neil is Malick's alter-ego. It was hard for me to identify or sympatize with Neil.

I did like the appearance of the older woman and especially the older negro talking to the priest, and the female friend stimulating Marina to live more freely.
And the editing remains great.

This movie was assumably very therapeutic for Malick to make but for me it did unfortunately not realize its potential.",1397692800,,2090,5.117302052785924
358056,3,6301758110,"In one of the brief ""making of"" clips that complement the theatrical trailer on the extras of this ""To the Wonder"" DVD, the film's stars (Ben Affleck, Olga Kurylenko, Rachel McAdams, and Javier Bardem) join its technical crew in acknowledging that they filmed most of their work here without a script of any kind. They boast about reading Heidegger and Dostoevsky to prepare for their roles, clearly enthralled by the idea that they are making a Really Important Movie for Terence Malick, of whom they speak (he is never actually interviewed for the making-of feature concerning his own film) in terms of adulation. As one might therefore expect, the movie itself turns out to be an example of Malick's worst excesses as a filmmaker, proving to be an exercise in superficiality masquerading as deep insights about human nature.

As the actors reveal in the documentary, they were pretty much figuring out their characters as the film went along, and it shows. The film's narrative is so minimalist, so full of silent montages set against Parisian and Midwestern backdrops of brilliant natural lighting, that it almost fails to qualify as a film in any traditional sense. It sometimes feels more like an advertisement, full of attitudes and postures rather than an actual story. Malick's obsession with capturing the authenticity of human experience through the artificiality of film results here in a series of documentary-style sequences with portentous voiceovers that appear to go nowhere. Malick is clearly trying to say something important about the ambiguity and uncertainty of human existence, but his characters are so bereft of motivation or plot (Ben Affleck barely speaks throughout the entire film) that it just falls flat. Affleck meets a girl and her 10-year old daughter in Paris, brings them back to the American midwest, marries the girl in a Catholic parish, watches her get deported, and then takes up again with an old flame before the French girl returns. But the characters are so inscrutable that we fail to become terribly involved with any of it, leaving the film as an interesting experiment that doesn't quite succeed in being good.

Although I enjoyed the surreal vision of World War II in Malick's ""The Thin Red Line,"" I have never been an unqualified Malick fan, as I find many of his self-conscious flourishes of authenticity to be more pretentious than meaningful. I haven't yet seen ""The Tree of Life,"" but I'm sorta losing my endurance for Malick films. This one has some nice moments, and Javier Bardem's Father Quintana character was particularly intriguing in his Mother Teresa-style portrait of disinterested love battling against spiritual dryness, but there's just not much here to relish. As always, Malick's style is more memorable than his substance here, which is perhaps a reflection of his Episcopalian love of aesthetics.

Malick's camerawork is as usual fluent, lucid to the point of being excessively poetic, capturing all the minute facial expressions of the actors in its close-ups. With a minimum dialogue and almost gaseous storyline, the movie may turn some audiences off (there were several of them leaving the theater during the show).

The woman's daughter, though, also frolics and spins with her arms out.  She's adorable, too, and has an adorable name, Tatiana, in case you missed the fact that she is adorable.  This goes on for quite a while.  The French woman tries to spin and dance for the guy in their house, using a scarf, but he is beginning to lose interest. She does manage to frolic and giggle when he puts the hose on her but that is short lived.  If only she could do something else...like cook or make conversation or read a book?

He is the most interesting character, so far and I had hopes that he might interject something of substance into this thin romance.  But even his presence didn't do it for me.  I was relieved when the French woman went home and the Affleck guy met a local girl.  She looked amazingly like the French one...same sweetheart face, petite body and long hair....only hers was blond.  And, thank God, she didn't spin around!  I had hopes for that duo but when she started giving her version of the same hard-luck story that the French woman delivered, I had enough.  I'll never know what happened to any of them and I'll never care.",1390176000,47,1841,4.79047619047619

358253,5,6301758110,"***This review may contain spoilers***

In Terrence Malick's sixth feature film in a 40+ year career, he tells us a story of love given and love withdrawn. Neil (Affleck) meets Marina (Kurylenko) in Paris, and they fall in love. They kiss, and they laugh together in the thrall of a new, untainted love. They visit the monastery at Mont Saint-Michel, the titular wonder. When Neil returns to the United States he does so with Marina and her young daughter, Tatiana, in tow.

The blighted neighborhoods and wide, empty spaces of Oklahoma are a change for Marina and her daughter, but they try to make the best of it. In the supermarket young Tatiana can't stop marveling at how ""clean"" everything is. Marina dances through fields, raising her hands to the sky in exaltation.

The first sign that there may be trouble in this paradise is Neil's apparent unwillingness to make it official and marry Marina. A poison seeps into the love between them, and soon they are fighting for reasons not even they know. When Marina takes his hand and places it against her face with tenderness, he pulls away. Tatiana, friendless now and with the glow of something new having worn off, begins to let out some anger of her own, directed primarily at Neil. She begs to leave this place where she does not belong.

Marina seeks advice from Father Quintana, a priest who spends much of his time among the lost and the wretched. Throughout the film we hear him (in voice-over) entreat God, perhaps for a sign, longing to hear a voice that he once heard, but can hear no longer. He seems unhappy and lonely, a man who is expected to comfort others while in need of comfort himself.

When her visa expires Marina returns to Europe with Tatiana, and it as this point that Neil reconnects with Jane, a woman he knew in his youth. She has her own tale of sadness and loss, but they seem to make each other happy, and we can hope that we may find a happy ending in this unexpected love. But life, or fate, or God have other plans, and Marina returns to Oklahoma without her daughter, who has gone to live with her father.

For a brief moment Marina and Neil are once again enveloped by light and love, and again happiness seems like something attainable. But then the poison returns, there is shouting, there are tears and a betrayal, and happiness slips steadily out of reach. When Marina once again (and likely for the last time) departs, the guttering flame of a love that once burned bright finally goes out, and the memories of laughter and tears, and the weight of what was and what could have been, are the only proof that it had ever burned at all.",1389744000,4,2631,4.540084388185654

Along with ""Badlands"" this one is the most linear of all of Malick's films and his majestic landscapes are a beauty to behold but what's it all about?  Ben Affleck is saddled with a character who hardly speaks and his ability to act with his face and body alone is limited.  Javier Bardem plays a conflicted priest, arguably the most interesting character, but he's not given enough of a narrative to build an arc.  Rachel McAdams accounts for the best 15 minutes of the film even if her character is also a bit of a mystery.  She says her husband didn't want to have kids while he was in school so they didn't.  Then it seems he took off, leaving her with a bankrupt ranch and somewhere along the way she had a child that died.  All interesting stuff but they're pieces that don't have a puzzle to fit into.

Gods Grandeur

THE WORLD is charged with the grandeur of God.
  It will flame out, like shining from shook foil;
  It gathers to a greatness, like the ooze of oil
Crushed. Why do men then now not reck his rod?
Generations have trod, have trod, have trod;  5
  And all is seared with trade; bleared, smeared with toil;
  And wears mans smudge and shares mans smell: the soil
Is bare now, nor can foot feel, being shod.

And for all this, nature is never spent;
  There lives the dearest freshness deep down things;  10
And though the last lights off the black West went
  Oh, morning, at the brown brink eastward, springs

  World broods with warm breast and with ah! bright wings.",1388534400,,923,4.451807228915663

358348,2,6301758110,"Terrence Malick is one of those directors that I don't always click with.  I know that he has a very large and supporting group of rabid fans and yet I have yet to be truly mesmerized by him since his debut, Badlands.  What I have always admired about Malick is that he tries to come at very deep rooted and intellectual subjects from a vantage point of almost complete detachment, allowing us to hover over these subjects without beating us over the head with them.  Hes focused on war and faith and death and celebrity and in each of these instances, even when I don't feel the film worked as a whole, you find this otherworldly atmosphere thanks to Malicks thickly laced scope of ideas.

Ive said this time and time again, but Malick is a director who tends to get in his own way.

To the Wonder is, in my eyes, the most disjointed, distracted and overall uneven film Malick has directed.  While Ive grown accustomed to his use of visual imagery and whispered voice over to create his point, the use of those images and whispers only reduced To the Wonder to an elongated commercial for Zoloft.

The synopsis here is rather simple.  Neil meets the free spirited Marina in Paris, where he sweeps her off her feet and brings her and her daughter back to his home in Oklahoma.  Their relationship starts to crumble almost immediately and soon Marina and her daughter pack up and leave.  In her absence, Neil starts to court Jane, a former flame, only to have Marina crawl back home and convince him to marry her, leaving Jane out to pasture.  Marriage doesnt fix the crack in their marriage though, and soon they find themselves at violent odds.  While all of this is happening, the Spanish pastor in their town is, apparently, struggling with his grasp on his own faith.

Im honestly not sure what Father Quintana has to do with this story, at all (completely reminded me of the useless Sean Penn segment in Tree of Life), but Javier Bardem was easily the best thing about the movie so I hate to say it should have been removed from the film.  In all honesty, this felt like a really bad editing issue.  Terrence Malick is notorious for chopping his films in half.  There was that controversy over The Thin Red Line where he actually cut Adrian Brody right out of the film, and he was slated to be THE STAR.  So, its no surprise that Rachel McAdams has like three scenes, but it is disheartening that the Father Quintana storyline feels like a poorly developed subplot.  There is absolutely no flow between these two storylines, despite having Marina briefly confide in Father Quintana about her relationship with Neil (and by briefly I literally mean for about five seconds).  Instead, these two stories feel ripped from two separate films and so I really feel like there is very important footage that was left on the cutting room floor that could have developed this into a more cohesive story.

Or maybe Malick just wrote a story void of those essential bones.

I think that is a major issue I take with this.  Even from a purely spiritual or emotional standpoint, To the Wonder feels vacant.  In dissecting the relationship between Marina and Neil, the film goes nowhere.  Their issues are never explored, their fights are never revealed and their tumultuous relationship is pretty much a repetition of pictures that reduce Marina to an obnoxious woman who prances around and wants to be tickled and Neil to a grump who pouts at the camera or walks out of the room with his eyes cast down at his feet.  There is no meat here, no actual character development and so we cant care for them at all.  The spiritual angle of faith feels like an afterthought, since Bardems scenes are sparse and feel like such a tack on I almost couldn't take them as part of the same film.

Yes, To the Wonder is beautiful, but it has nothing to say.",1383609600,3,3834,4.559124087591241

358556,3,6301758110,"Director Terrence Malick is most certainly an acquired taste, but one I acquired early with ""Badlands"" (1973) and last saw in the remarkable ""The Tree of Life"" (2011).  It's pretty rare that he follows up so quickly given his record (10 films total).  Maybe that is the problem with this film.  And make no mistake, it's a problem.  ""To The Wonder"" certainly isn't a terrible movie.  Mallick's use of the outdoor landscape resonates throughout the film.  Set in Oklahoma, he edits quickly between everyday scenes.  A setting sun, a flower, an insect.  The film is sparse of dialog.

Neil (Ben Afflick) has fewer lines than you can count on your fingers and toes.  He has a romantic affair in Paris with young Marina (Olga Kurylenko, ""Oblivion"").  She has young daughter, having been abandon by her husband.  Neil agrees reluctantly to bring her to America where they are to be married and she can get her Green Card.  Neil works for the state or federal EPA and is seen taking soil and water samples throughout the film.  Why?  Dunno.

As he becomes more distant emotionally, Marina and daughter will return to France, but eventually return.  In the meantime, Neil rekindles a relationship with Jane (Rachel McAdams, ""Midnight In Paris"").  When she starts a discussion about marriage, Neil retreats again.  Hey, the guy doesn't want to get married!

While all this is going on, Father Quintana (Javier Bardem, ""Skyfall"") is having his own mental issues.  Is he doing all he can do for humanity?  Should he even be a priest?  He eventually becomes a confidant to Marina, when she returns.  Marina and Neil reunite, but their bickering and emotional struggles increase to the point of being violent.  Is anything resolved?  Love isn't always perfect.  As I look back at Malick's films, this one is certainly his least impressive but perhaps most personal.

In spite of my reservations about the film, there is nothing not to like about the Blu ray transfer.  Shot using 35mm and 65mm cameras, it all comes across beautifully in the 1080p picture and with a 2.35:1 aspect ratio.  The grey and brown starkness of rural Oklahoma comes across with excellent color and hue.  The contrast is spot on and the detail is excellent.  Malick's films always have great soundtracks and this one is no different.  Using DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  There are numerous outdoor shots with staging in Paris and Oklahoma and the range from street noise to whistling wind come through the speakers loud and clear.

358695,1,6301758110,"I rented this movie based on the star power of Ben Affleck, Rachel McAdams and Javier Bardem.  It was definitely not what I expected and I didn't like it.  I am not a Terrence Malick fan, in fact I absolutely hated his most highly-acclaimed film The Thin Red Line.  Calling To The Wonder a movie is a bit of a stretch - it's more like the film equivalent of poetry, compared to a novel.  This movie had lots of beautiful cinematography and people staring off into the distance looking pensive, lots of symbolism, but none of the plot or much dialogue that you'd expect from a normal movie.  For me it was as though I bought something that looked like a novel but instead it was a book of poetry, full of symbolism but without the type of story or plot that I expected.

Although most of the movie was conveyed visually, there was some dialogue and that was another area I really disliked.  For a movie that is overall advertised as being in English, definitely at least half of the dialogue is in French and some Spanish with English subtitles.  An even bigger surprise was that when characters spoke English, they (intentionally?) mumbled so that it was very difficult to understand - basically the only understandable dialogue was the French and Spanish parts!

If you're a huge Terrence Malick fan and know what you're getting into, go ahead and watch this.  If you're expecting a normal American movie in English, stay away.",1377993600,9,1428,4.608695652173913
358696,3,6301758110,"Here is another Terrence Malick film, following ""The Tree of Life"" only made one year before. Reportedly, ""To the Wonder"" is, like his previous effort, a semi-autobiographical movie of the director fiercely protective of his private life. Here Ben Affleck plays Neil, an American travelling in Europe, who falls in love with a recently divorced Ukrainian mother of one daughter Marina played by Olga Kurylenko. Meanwhile, Father Quintana (Javier Bardem), respected priest losing his faith.

Though ""To the Wonder"" benefits from the poetic beauty of the images thanks to photographer Emmanuel Lubezki (who worked for the director's ""The New World"" and ""The Tree of Life""), the film itself remains an impressionistic collection of images. We are supposed to look behind these images and find something, while honestly I am not sure it's worth trying.

I know Terrence Malick's unique filmmaking style, and I love his earlier work ""Days of Heaven,"" which offers a simple but intriguing story. In this newest film, what the director does with fragmentary images may be unconventional, but what happens in the film, if derived of its showy styles, is pretty conventional, even banal, together with the dull voiceovers. To me, ""To the Wonder"" is frustratingly pretentious and self-indulgent.

I think I know ""To the Wonder"" is trying to do. It's about the feeling and emotion envisioned by the director. But people just don't cry or laugh. There is a context in which those emotions are expressed, and usually dialogue, story or character development provides that context, which the film refuses to do. This may have worked with other material, but if it's a love story, which is a very personal thing, well, I don't think so.",1377820800,,1721,5.117437722419929

It's easy to see why people, even fans of THE TREE OF LIFE, would be turned off by Malick's latest effort; the cryptic editing and wandering shots are on full display, with very little attention to a through-line.  I delayed my viewing of the film until recently based on initial reactions, despite my absolute admiration for Terrence Malick, but I regret that immensely; this film not only serves as a brilliant companion piece to THE TREE OF LIFE, it goes to far darker territory and is very confrontational about the hypocrisies of life and the struggle to live up to expectations.  What most opinions on the film seem to gloss over is the incredibly powerful sequences involving Javier Bardem as Father Quintana, especially the scenes of him walking around town and visiting local residents, who are obviously played by non-actors.  These sequences are so beautiful yet so raw, daring in how down to earth they are.  Malick's films are pretty much dramatic nature documentaries, but this is the closest to an actual documentary that he's made, and it's spellbinding.",1376784000,5,1237,4.946859903381642
358837,1,6301758110,"Save your $4-$5 and watch the trailer! If you do this, you will have just seen a decent film short made by someone who is probably freelancing from the advertising industry.

My problem is not as much with this quirky film (yawn... and I can stay awake through almost anything), but with the fact that the trailer and description is totally misleading. Subjective film-making and story-telling aside (as well as lack of plot), the trailer is nearly fraudulent.

Take note: This is a foreign film. The trailer is nothing like the film. It drops in and out of French and Spanish and has sub-titles. It should be properly advertised as such. Amazon will be giving a lot of refunds for misrepresenting this film as an English-spoken romantic drama. It's not. Did anyone at Amazon even watch the trailer and the film before putting out for purchase?

Now on to the film. I'm a foreign-film buff and love foreign films. Anyone who has slept through films with me knows that I'm really generous with my time watching what I hope turns out to be a good film even when it initially doesn't seem to be. However, even I was not prepared for this pretty-bad film as based on the completely English-speaking trailer composed from bits and pieces of the film, edited out of sequence.

One comment in favor of the trailer though - I do think that whoever made this trailer should be nominated for best fake-out trailer ever because they probably shaved at least $100K off the financial debacle of this production. Whenever I see a trailer like this I ask myself ""why isn't there an Oscar category for best misleading trailers that save film distribution costs"" yet? This trailer should certainly be nominated (if not win) that category. Bravo to the trailer editor who salvaged a fairly awful film and somehow managed to piece together this misleading trailer. I hope the producers paid you really, really well!

Bottom line- misleading trailer and the film not worth your money or time!",1376611200,2,1972,4.771260997067449

358924,5,6301758110,"I am not a Christian (or a theist at all), but this film strikes me as a fascinating and movingly Christian reflection on how its author learned to love.  The film's protagonist, Neil (Ben Affleck), is not a 'character' in the film but instead provides the sensibility or subjectivity through which the plot of the film develops.  The plot-line is this: Neil thinks he knows how to love, it soon emerges that he doesn't know how to love, then through the course of the film he learns how to love.  He learns at last how to love Marina (Olga Kurylenko) partly through consultation with Father Quintana (Javier Bardem), who shares his own struggles with his love-commitment to Jesus Christ.

If you know a bit about Terrence Malick's life, you suspect that these reflections are autobiographical: the 60-something Malick probing how the 30- or 40-something Malick learned to partake in genuine love relations.  But that doesn't matter much.  The force of the inquiry does not depend on its status as autobiography.

The potential viewer of this film faces two questions: do you want to reflect on how you came, or might someday come, to love? and do you want to reflect on this from a specifically Christian point of view?

As I said, I don't myself share that point of view: that's not how I conceptualize my own learning-how-to-love experiences.  But then I didn't learn how to love in Oklahoma either.  (I did it, or tried, in Los Angeles, with a woman from farther away than France.)  The film's reflections are specific to the experiences of its maker, but they explore a universal human problem.

The film is not entertainment.  I aims not to sweep you away from your life for two hours but to plunge you more deeply into it.  If you don't want to reflect on your life and on how you have loved or failed to love those with whom you have shared it, don't watch.  But if you are drawn to such reflections, this film may help you pursue them.

(It may also help you see how film can serve as a medium for such reflection, if that wasn't already apparent to you.  But this particular film is not about film.)",1374537600,32,2109,4.596256684491979

358931,5,6301758110,"""To the Wonder"" ( la merveille) is an extraordinary film that must be taken in full on its own terms.  It is tempting for those who know much (or even a little) about Malick to focus on some of his familiar techniques and devices, make comparisons with earlier films, and ponder what it is he is trying to say this time (especially coming after ""The Tree of Life"").  It also is tempting for all kinds of viewers to puzzle over the scarcity of dialogue and the paring of the scenes in the drama.  Yes, this movie demands attention, of all kinds, and, of course, if one wants to study and critique it after multiple viewings, then by all means, do so.  But I fear that those who might begin by holding the film at arm's length, puzzling, judging, or simply waiting for explanations, may end up missing the wonder it really is.

My advice, therefore, is take it all in, give yourself over to this film, and do not get distracted by what might ordinarily strike you as missing plot details.  Drink in every bit of the screen shots you can, let the music wrap around you, and imprint the few words you see and hear on your forehead (not unlike what Tatinia does in the movie) so you'll remember them later.

I know that this is not necessarily how many will approach a film by a director like Malick.  I probably would have viewed it differently myself if I had not stumbled upon it by accident, after having been somewhat disenchanted with ""The Tree of Life.""  I just happened to find ""To the Wonder"" on cable PPV one day after returning from a trip to France, which just happened to include a day's drive to see Le Mont St. Michel (""La Merveille,"" as it is known in France) and was curious about what Malick had done with it.

Somewhat to my surprise, my first viewing of the film left me breathless. I was immediately drawn into the sights and sounds of each scene and driven by the director's extraordinary way of melding cinematography, music, characters, emotion, and setting into a single vision.  Yes, I missed a few details from the script (hard to see the subtitles or absorb the spoken words, especially on a small screen) the first time, and I have absorbed more and more with each viewing (several more at home and one at a movie theater).  But it was not as though it was difficult or inaccessible the first time.  It worked, I think, because I let the direction make the coherency for me from the beginning.

I realize that others may have different experiences and opinions, but I would urge anyone who may be inclined to see this film to try it first by plunging in, by seeing France and Oklahoma and the characters from the inside, and letting it all sink in, reach your heart and mind and all your senses.  There is an honesty and freshness to all that is portrayed  -- the pain, the sorrow, the beauty, the wonder, the poverty and despair -- which makes whatever transcendence comes through as if in real time, place, and memory, rather than superimposed.  And while there may be all kinds of prices to be paid in making films like this, at least this time I think Malick came as close as anyone can to making it all work beautifully together, paring film down to its barest essentials, yet creating a wondrous feast in the end. I cannot recall a film that has moved me so much (with the possible exception of Kalatozov's ""Letter Never Sent"").

A few words about the Christian elements in the movie.  As Michael Carroll pointed out in his Amazon review, Malick's films are first and foremost experience.  Part of the experience conveyed by ""To the Wonder"" are the words and actions that are a call to God:  Marina's experiences at mass and confession, Jane's reflections on what she is told the Bible says about the loss of her child; Marina and Neil's marriage (a Protestant ceremony, as we know Marina must be denied the sacramental rite because of her prior marriage and divorce); Neil's occasional attendance at mass, his spoken rejection of Jane's request to pray with him; and, of course, the actions, sermons, and thoughts of the priest -- just to name a few.  None of these calls are met with direct, or arguably, even indirect answers, and all are part of a larger whole that conveys remembered experience of people, places, and things through images and sounds.

The film is, indeed, a deeply personal and deeply Christian view of life, love, pain, sorrow, regret, and joy.  But it is not a sermon, and it is not necessary to subscribe to Christianity or any other faith in particular to take part in the experience.  Anyone who has experienced the slings and arrows of romantic love (and regretfully taken arms against its troubles), struggled with the demands of commitment, and doubted one's ability to make and sustain family and/or partnership, will know the pain, the guilt, and the possibilities for forgiveness and redemption, of one sort or another.  Malick does indicate that there is something ""missing"" if we do not finally connect with others and the world around us, if we do not try our best to love and care for people and the natural world we live in.  But he's not preaching this -- he's showing us the slow, painful, and often confusing experience of learning it bit by bit.

While some may find the final scenes (and the denouement that precedes them) bewildering, or at best, susceptible of multiple interpretations, I do not think that it is meant to be inconclusive in the way we might expect a ""serious"" film to be.  Nor do I think it reflects sloppiness on the part of Malick trying to wrap up a film created in what appears (at least to the actors and outsiders) an ad hoc fashion.  There is redemption, but not the kind that progresses towards a concluding epiphany.  It comes instead from remembered experience and a sacramental vision of all of life, which puts brushing one's teeth, putting socks on, quarreling, lovemaking, fishing in a lake, kissing the buds on a tree, dancing, swimming, sampling for tar sand, struggling with drug addiction, poverty, and pollution, all on par with the rites of Holy Communion, confession, and matrimony.

The film tests us all, sees if we are willing to touch and feel the sunlight warming the stained glass window and walk with and among, the poor and the elderly, as well as the main characters.  We can choose to hide in our homes, behind our windows, with the world outside knocking to get in, or we can see, hear, and feel what is wondrous, as well as painful, frightening, and confusing.  ""Christ be with me. Christ before me. Christ behind me. Christ in me. Christ beneath me. Christ above me. Christ on my right. Christ on my left. Christ in the heart.""  This is not a call to faith but a deep expression of what the experience of faith is.  Whether one understands or shares such an experience in Christian terms, it is still a wonder to not just behold but to live for a time.

I can hardly wait for this film to come out on DVD in August.  I see it is still playing in selected theaters through July.  I would strongly urge anyone who wants to seriously give this film a chance to see it, at least first, on as large a screen as possible.  This is NOT a film for IPad or laptop viewing.

The film appeared to verge on self-parody, with Terrence Malick's penchant for long silences, meditative voiceovers and random rambles by the protagonists making the film come off as offcuts from the directionless Tree of Life.

The second time I watched it I found myself pulled in Malick's world. The cinematography is gorgeous, almost every scene painstakingly constructed, poignant and beautiful. The back-story of Javier Bardem's priest whose faith is tested daily by a life of solitude and service among the poor and suffering was both sad and inspiring.

It's not an easy film. It subtly raises hard philosophical questions without providing easy answers, and it leaves you with a sense of unease as the final credits begin to roll.",1370649600,5,798,5.130769230769231
359005,5,6301758110,"Permeated by a sense of the sacred, Terrence Malick's latest film points us to the transience of all things. Appropriately titled To the Wonder, the film has Malick's stamp written all over it: philosophical voice-overs uttered in hushed tones to a haunting orchestral soundtrack, panoramic displays of the physical beauty of nature, a story that features little dialogue, and an untranslatable feeling for the spiritual. Released just two years after his critically acclaimed The Tree of Life, Malick introduces us to the main characters immediately but they feel more like symbols than real people and we never really get to know and understand the ""why"" of their actions.

Neil (Ben Affleck) is an environmental inspector traveling in Europe when he meets Marina (Olga Kurylenko), a divorcee who is living in Paris with her ten-year-old daughter Tatiana (Tatiana Chiline). As the film opens, we hear Olga's voice-overs turn the world into inner space: ""Newborn, I open my eyes. I melt into the eternal night. A spark. You brought me out of the shadows. You lifted me off the ground. You brought me back to life."" ""What is this love that loves us? It comes from nowhere. From all around. The sky. You, cloud. You love me too."" One is unclear if she is talking to Neil or to God.

Visiting Mount St. Michel, Neil and Marina climb to the top of the abbey ""to the Wonder"" where she sees a world ""forever at peace."" The camera then caresses them in the mud of the beach as they express their love playfully - glancing, laughing, gesturing, and kissing with freedom and sensuality, ""two wings of the same spirit."" They go to Paris and walk among its fountains, rivers, and monuments. Olga twirls like a ballet dancer with uncommon grace but Neil is expressionless, stolid, and impenetrable. When they go back to Neil's home in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, however, their relationship takes a different shape, existing in a stultifying environment of polluted water, cookie-cutter houses furnished sparingly, and the feeling, expressed cogently by Tatiana, that ""there's something missing,"" perhaps mirroring Malick's childhood in the Southwest.

Sadly, the ""something missing"" begins to be filled in by quarreling, lack of communication, and frustration. Like the local Spanish-speaking priest, Father Quintana, played by a soulful Javier Bardem, they are searching for something that seems just beyond their grasp. Marina seeks solace with the priest but, like the Cur d'Ambricourt in The Diary of a Country Priest, he is filled with self-doubt and a sense of failure. He tells God ""Everywhere you're present and I can't even see you."" He asks ""Show me how to love you"" and, as he tends to the poor, the addicts, the prisoners, and the sick, recites the moving words from St. Patrick's Breastplate:

""Christ with me, Christ before me, Christ behind me, Christ in me, Christ beneath me, Christ above me, Christ on my right, Christ on my left, Christ when I lie down, Christ when I sit down, Christ when I arise...""

He gives sermons to a half-empty church, hears confessions, gives communion, but the look on his face prompts an elderly woman to pray for him so he can ""achieve the gift of joy."" Father Quintana's alienation reflects the crisis of Neil and Marina whose conflicts result in the desire for freedom. Marina goes back to France when her visa expires, but experiences a new loneliness in Europe and returns to Oklahoma where Neil has reunited with an old friend, Jane, (Rachel McAdams), now a rancher raising buffaloes.

Enigmatic, distancing, and often infuriating, To the Wonder does not have the immediate impact of The Tree of Life, yet in its own way is a meditation on love just as mysterious and profound. A film that takes place ""in a realm which no word has ever entered,"" it is a work that suggests, implies, and evokes rather than commands, forcing us to confront how we connect to ourselves and the world around us, to be with the images without trying to figure them out, to weave our way in and out of the silences, to let go into the acceptance of not knowing, and to be aware of the wonder around us and bathe in its light.",1370044800,7,4143,4.861189801699717

359009,4,6301758110,"Nor is it likely to be like any other movie you see this summer.

Terence Malick, to his credit, loves women, and graceful women who for the most part know how to move in space, especially in Nebraska or wherever there are fields with golden sun.  These women, Rachel McAdams and Olga Kurylenko look really nice in juxtaposition with Ben A, but the camera is usually on them, which is a good thing,  These women look good with empire waists although these women would look OK in Kmart too.

Mont St Michel is really beautiful.

I wish love were like this, but it was never for me, and that is why the magic of cinema is a romantic gift that Mallick has.  He has a great ear for music.  Music also moves the film; in fact, the film is composed rather than shot.  Each scene is a fugue.

He also clearly loves America

He has a terrific lens on his camera that can make anyplace, even a crappy gas station in the plains of the country look good, and somehow makes everything look really clean and uncluttered.  THis makes the characters central.

Javier Bardem is a priest with a crisis of faith.  We watch him minister while interior monologue creates his stress.

This film is for people who love cinematography, not acting, and possess a vague, universal story line with which to work.  I have always liked Malick, and he has expanded the scene from Days of Heaven when Brooke Adams sneaks out to see Richard Gere and they cavort in a small stream.  And the champagne glass falls underwater. Little was said then; the sin concocted.

I find it thrilling to watch a new romantic type of filmmaking come about,whether you agree with the sentiment. It is not for everybody.  Especially not for someone named Pepper Potts.",1368748800,9,1719,4.525974025974026

As a Terrence Malick film (The Tree of Life, The Thin Red Line), To The Wonder is an unconventional story of passion, betrayal, regret, and the fleeting emotions encompassing the complexity of monogamous love. Told through layers of natural landscape shots of Paris and the American Midwest, as well as with narrative consciousness in place of dialogue, Malick intentionally gives his story a contemplative sense of pacing as he allows his unique vision of imagery and sound to give his themes and characters an expanse of interpretation beyond the reach of a script. To many audiences, To The Wonder may be deemed too slow or lacking in dramatic development but is nonetheless a film that reaches to give new meaning not only to the joy and tragedy of commitment but to the renewal of hope in place of despair. Javier Bardem also gives insightful perspective as a disillusioned priest struggling to find God when surrounded by misfortune and grief in his own community.",1368144000,4,1181,4.939698492462312

Of the films Affleck acted in this past year, people will likely remember this one over Argo. You may disagree because it won the Best Picture Oscar, but have your parents name all the Oscar winners in their lifetime... I doubt many left a strong impression later.

What Malick achieves in this film is unparalleled. The social norms and expectations of a husband or wife are set in the scope of what love should be. It's not titles or roles, but humility towards others. To not only make oneself happy or better, but to make your loved ones - as well as others - the same. ""One doesn't find her lovely, he makes her lovely"".

Some will find parts cliche, but only those with the shallowest of interpretations. These ""cliches"" are often depicted in ways that, in contrast to the ethereal, reveals how desperate we grasp for another's love.",1367366400,4,1014,4.659217877094972

You have to watch them over and over again to pick up the message.  I have only seen the movie once but what I took away from this film was that it was a profound, very profound actually, meditation on love but especially love in a Christian sense.  The voice overs referring to ""the love that loves us"" are a subtle hint, as is the name of the movie.  In the movie we learn that the Wonder is Mont St-Michele, one of the most beautiful churches in the world.  The Wonder though at an even deeper level is this ""love that loves us"".  While the relationship between Neil and Marina is passionate and powerful at first it eventually fades.  Yet while it is white hot we see the world, through Malick's camera lens, in what reviewer Damon Linker calls a transfigured sense.  Who has not felt this way when they are in love?  There is a deeper point to be made about love though and that comes from Father Quintana (Javier Bardem at his finest).  While Neil and Marina struggle with their love, on again and off again, Father Quintana struggles with love at a much deeper level, sacrificial love, the love of Christ.  It was these scenes, the ones of Father Quintana working with the poor and the drug addicted on the streets as well as giving communion to prisoners, that really spoke to me.  Father Quintana's homilies on love are deep and still have me pondering this love that loves us.  Watch this movie, see it sever times, ponder God's Love.",1367366400,50,1578,4.472027972027972

Ben Affleck who is a favorite of mine and has been unfairly judged over the years is wasted in this film. He is a very talented Film maker, a very talented actor and in this his part is whittled away until there are only disjointed moments left of a man with commitment issues and no explanation why. Both female leads are represented as desperately in love but the main character seems to be one moment outragously giddy and happy and the next desperately sad, Bi-Polar you ask as you watch??

359311,5,6301758110,"This film could be viewed as a friendly little reminder of the overwhelming influence of the nonverbal. I'm thinking of all those cliques that we've heard thousands of times: It's about what we do and not what we say, familiarity breeds contempt, silence is golden, it's not what you say it's how you say it, it's all about listening, attitude is everything, and on and on.

Up until I saw this film, I thought I had all of that under my skin. Not so. I guess I had to have someone or something show it to me. Literally show it to me. This film did just that. I hope that I will work harder on understanding the nonverbal from this point forward in my own life. (Please note that I'm not referring to this as nonverbal ""communication."" This is deliberate. Communication implies forethought. This film did a very good job of demonstrating that much of what goes on between people nonverbally is not deliberate.)

I read a couple of reviews in the newspapers before I saw this film.  It was supposed to be a ""subtle"" and ""elusive"" film, according to the reviews.  But as I was watching this film I thought, ""This?? subtle? elusive? They have to be kidding.""  By the end of the film, I could have sworn I had been watching an Oliver Stone film (I mean this in a good way; I like Oliver Stone films).  I felt that I had been pounded over the head again and again with what the film was saying.

And that's O.K. This film is a very fine piece of ""wake-up"" theater. And I will work hard on getting this stuff under my skin. It will make me happier, more aware, more attuned to people. (I couldn't help thinking that, as I watched this film, I typically have very little trouble whatsoever noticing and appreciating and tuning into nature sorroundings, i.e., the non-human nonverbal, if you will. In real life, and in all the films that I have seen prior to this film, what goes on verbally with humans usually diverts my attention away from what is going on with them nonverbally, which is unfortunate, because, as this film has taught me [or maybe just reminded me in a very direct manner], it is the nonverbal that leads us to the wonder.)",1366416000,7,2135,4.445012787723785
359312,2,6301758110,"After visiting Marina (Olga Kurylenko) in Paris, Neil (Ben Affleck) brings Marina and her daughter Tatiana (Tatiana Chiline) back to the states with the intent of getting married and allowing Marina to get her green card. However their relationship hits a rough patch and Marina and Neil both find themselves traveling their own paths. Marina encounters a priest named Father Quintana (Javier Bardem), who seems to have a struggle finding his own happiness. Meanwhile Neil rekindles an old flame with childhood friend Jane (Rachel McAdams).

It was difficult to anticipate a film like ""To the Wonder"" since Terrence Malick films are generally pretty abstract. ""The Tree of Life"" felt like half a dozen storylines competing for your attention and none of them felt like they were properly resolved. ""To the Wonder"" continues Malick's streak of featuring incredible cinematography in his pictures. Cathedrals, trickling streams containing slumbering rocks, walking along the beach, a rose bush covered in snow, and an endless array of impressive shots of the sky and animals in their natural habitat; a National Geographic special is like the secondary storyline to Neil and Marina's relationship.

The narrative of ""To the Wonder"" feels extremely erratic. It's not that it can't decide who to follow or where to go, but the path it travels seems so random that it feels like someone just closed their eyes, spun around, and pointed and then followed that path for awhile before jumping back to the previous path. The characters are practically driven by indecisiveness. Neil doesn't want to be alone, but can't seem to commit. Marina wants to be with Neil and then she doesn't. She wants to live in the States and then she wants to move back to Paris. Father Quintana wants to help people, but refuses to help himself. Even when these characters get what they want, it's like a flip switches on inside and they can't accept it. It becomes extremely frustrating.

What you end up with is constant visits to the drive-in restaurant Sonic, repetitive trips to the grocery store, and frolicking through grassy field that seem to last a lifetime. Affleck seems to only have a handful of lines and spends most of his time lurking about; pacing around, not talking, and looking disgruntled. There is something in ""To the Wonder."" Something about blossoming relationships always falling apart just when they seem to be at their peak and what appears to be two different lifetimes lived by one man. A priest is able to make others feel good about themselves yet is so empty inside and a woman is in love with a man who's in love with another woman. You're just kind of left dangling when it comes to Jane and Father Quintana and even though the story between Neil and Marina is given the most time its conclusion is massively unsatisfying.

While it may be filmed beautifully, ""To the Wonder"" doesn't exactly move its gestating 112-minute duration along any faster with everyone on-screen galloping around their front yard or a field full of slow moving bison genitalia. So embrace that obnoxious ten year old of yours, hold a rooster, and lick a tree branch because ""To the Wonder"" is a romantic drama that wanders around so aimlessly it can't decide where to go next.",1366329600,4,3259,4.930783242258652
359313,5,6301758110,"Visiting the world of Terrence Malick in many ways must be differentiated from `watching a movie' and that is likely one of the reasons there are so many honest people who love movies who find TO THE WONDER a major disappointment, `a mess', `not a movie' and other responses. That Terrence Malick has a gift of blending film and thought and philosophy and music and silence into a meditation on his views of life, of love, of the human condition is a given. The `story' is nonlinear, given in bits an pieces like the momentary light fireflies offer in Oklahoma nights or the strains of themes from the classical music with which he bathes his quiet moments, themes that begin, echo, go nowhere, and is about those very personal responses to life as it happens to us or as we perceive it has a meaning, a direction, a connection to God.

In view of that it seems a bit odd that Magnolia pictures offers a synopsis of the `plot' and that should be shared here: `Neil (Ben Affleck) is an American traveling in Europe who meets and falls in love with Marina (Olga Kurylenko), an Ukrainian divorc&eacute;e who is raising her 10-year-old daughter Tatiana (Tatiana Chiine) in Paris. The lovers travel to Mont St. Michel, the island abbey off the coast of Normandy, basking in the wonder of their newfound romance. Neil makes a commitment to Marina, inviting her to relocate to his native Oklahoma with Tatiana. He takes a job as an environmental inspector and Marina settles into her new life in America with passion and vigor. After a holding pattern, their relationship cools. Marina finds solace in the company of another exile, the Catholic priest Father Quintana (Javier Bardem), who is undergoing a crisis of faith. Work pressures and increasing doubt pull Neil further apart from Marina, who returns to France with Tatiana when her visa expires. Neil reconnects with Jane (Rachel McAdams), an old flame. They fall in love until Neil learns that Marina has fallen on hard times.'

It is possible to give each of these basically silent (voice over) characters an interpretation but instead it feels as though Malick is simply watching four people respond to the world as it affects interpersonal relationships. Father Quintana, in his painful sadness at trying to find the light that God once provided him to nurture his fellow man, appears be whispering that the reason for our breakups, for our fragmented lives and relationships, is that we can no longer see God. If we could, we would be whole again. Yet even this concept seems less important than every person in the presence of this film finding his/her own meaning: Malick seems to be providing that privacy, that distancing from making his `characters' fully credible that allows each of them to become part of our own longings and angst and faith that somewhere, sometime this will all make sense - if it is supposed to.

The cinematography is provided by Emmanuel Lubezki and the musical score is attributed to Hanan Townsend: there should be mention of the use of themes from classical composers - Wagner's Parsifal themes and Henryk G&oacute;recki's symphonic music being the two most often used. But in the end this is a Terrence Malick meditation, and as such it is the way he combines the images, the light, the locations, the music and the actors to make us ponder.

I don't want to say more--it's a masterful work that manages to balance useful narrative and a connection to the incredible elements of ordinary experience on the one hand, along with the classic Malick attention to divinity in all its forms.

7815002,1,6301758110,"This movie is all about the scenery, close ups on hands, and women twirling in open fields. The storyline is absent. I had to google the movie and read a review to figure out some of the dropped plot lines like Bens cell phone conversation about contamination in the water. Was it just me or did it seem like Ben lived in two different homes? One was an older siding home with wood floors and a second story, and the other home was a brick home and carpet.???",1520812800,,459,4.2272727272727275

7815004,3,6301758110,"There are two (or three) parallel stories about seeking the immanent presence of the Divine through love.  The principal narrative is by Marina and concerns her relationship with Neil.  She seeks God in love, and for a time seems to have have found Him.  The parallel search for Divine presence is by Quintana, a Catholic priest.  He seeks Jesus among the poor and downtrodden, but he is torn by spiritual crisis because he is unable to find Him there.  Neil is a familiar figure to readers of existential novels: he is unable to make a real commitment.  As Quintana says in a voice over, God can forgive those who err, but with those who cannot commit to anything, God can do nothing.  This is a film that is extraordinarily beautiful but also very difficult to watch.  The experience of the film is not diminished by knowing the plot or by being aware of its artistic devices.  First, Malick uses the sun to suggest Truth, as in divine Truth (think of Plato's metaphor of the cave and the sun).  It peeks out on the horizon and enters inside intensely.  One prisoner cannot sit in the light of the sun.  Second, there are lengthy shots of nature that are meant to suggest, again, Divine presence.  Neil works as some sort of environmental engineer, possibly for an oil company.  But he seems to cover up environmental problems, rather than expose them, just as he is unable to see or, perhaps, even to search for Divine presence.  Third, the profusion of languages (French, Spanish and Italian) serves to highlight the disconnectedness of the characters from each other.  Fourth, still another character, Jane, has a relationship with Neil, but she has the idea that only an eternal commitment can make the relationship real (again, think Plato, but this time the forms).  She serves as a kind of foil for Marina.  Marina is the only one who can see that Truth and Love exist only in the moment.  Hence, she alone is able to embrace the Divine presence in the world through love and joy, however fleeting.  Malick omits explanations, and he leaves it to his viewers to appreciate the metaphysics.  Most will not see it.  Those who do--I think I have it right--will be more impressed with the ambition of making a film about Divine presence than they will with the final product.",1515888000,,2280,4.675879396984925
7815005,4,6301758110,"A powder-keg of questions and conflicts in a tranquil experience through the grotto of love. To the Wonder doesnt want to casually tell you a story about an American (Ben Affleck) trying to assimilate his French love interest into the United States  no, director Terrence Malick opts to submerge the audience in a conflict of love vs. identity. Where Jessica Chastains character in The Tree of Life (2011) has surrendered herself unto grace,Olga Kurylenko struggles to find her place in the world, both physically and mentally. Its the juxtapose of Kurylenkos dilemma that fuels To the Wonder;the ensemble of actors seem lost in Malicks intensely disconnected narrative style  its Kurylenkos energy and lust for living that give her purpose (and deliver one of the years best performances).",1514419200,,790,5.21259842519685

7815008,1,6301758110,Snooze! I saw this same movie with Brad Pitt as the lead. That was boring and so was this. I should have known better. I think both movies are trying to hard to be something more and artsy. Give it a rest. If you want to watch this in the background while you're doing about 5 other things then Yes I recommend it.,1506297600,,314,4.0
