8079898,4,B000AV2GT2,"Very good early 50's Mexican-made, Spanish-language (no dubbing or sub-titles) horror film that is more of a morality play.  A brilliant scientist's daughter is murdered by thugs hired by two unscrupulous businessmen who want to steal the doc's inventions.  They don't achieve their goals.  The doctor figures out who orchestrated the crime and plots his revenge.  He pretends to let them underpay him for his formulas and ally's himself with the criminal underworld to help him with his plans.  He takes into his home the slave of the underworld boss, a disfigured woman called The Witch, a sad, pathetic individual.  The scientist creates a potion that transforms the witch into a beautiful woman so she can seduce and help him destroy his enemies.  She falls in love with a partner of the two businessmen and sets out to save him from the doctor's mistaken wrath.  The Phoenix DVD is very good quality.  Recommended for fans of the genre.",1453507200,,941,4.905063291139241
8079899,4,B000AV2GT2,"Surprisingly effective and atmospheric Mexican horror film directed by Chano Urueta, which mixes elements from every story featuring a mad scientist, or a woman falling in love with the wrong man, from Fritz Lang's ""M"" and, above anything else, the basic premise of ""The Miraculous Serum"" (1952), first adaptation of Stanley G. Weinbaum's short story ""The Adaptative Ultimate"", made for the TV series ""Tales of Tomorrow"", and later remade -again for television- as ""Beyond Return"" (1955) for the series ""Science Fiction Theatre"", and finally as the feature ""She Devil"" (1957), in which Mari Blanchard played a brunette with TB who was turned into a lethal and invulnerable blonde. There is a big difference, though: after ""The Witch"" (called as such because of her extremely ugly face) is injected with the serum, turned into a beautiful woman, and educated and polished to pass as a rich contessa (Lilia del Valle), she remains emotionally vulnerable. She has to kill three business men who supposedly wronged the scientist (Julio Villarreal), but she falls for the young, dashing Fedor (Ramn Gay), leading the story to tragedy, when all the marginal and handicapped men and women from the underworld (as in ""M"") create their own court of justice It is funny how in these strange Mexican fabrications, names and locations from Eastern Europe are candidly mixed with native elements, and in the end get away with it. Perhaps that is one of the reasons why many of them are so fascinating, including others directed by Urueta, as ""El monstruo resucitado"", ""The Witch's Mirror"" and ""El barn del terror"" (Brainiac). Beautiful Lilia del Valle, a superb comedienne, singer and dancer, is very moving as ""la bruja"".",1425081600,5,1709,5.107142857142857
8079900,4,B000AV2GT2,"""La Bruja"" is the fantasy story of a hideously ugly woman who drinks a professor's remarkable elixir and presto she becomes a radiant beauty.  She is presented to the Mexican high society as a countess and gets the senors all excited with her beauty.  Naturally, this being a melodrama, she can't stay beautiful forever.  The b/w photography, acting, and directing are all fine, but the makeup for the Bruja's ugly face is unconvincing.  Unfortunately, there are no English subtitles in this Phoenix edition,  so unless you understand Spanish, you will have to guess at the meaning of the dialog.",1397088000,4,596,4.97979797979798

8079904,4,B000AV2GT2,I cannot stop raving about this forgotten treasure of a psychological thriller from the Golden Age of Mexican Cinema.  This moralistic tale of the perennial 'ugly duckling' who gets her wish gt=ranted.  Sadly it features a harsh moralistic ending that will stay with the viewer.  This movie made me think about the people in society who hide in the shadows for fear of being mocked and abused.  This is a very good film.,1252713600,7,420,4.712328767123288
