6203106,5,B00HSHPYNG,I love all four movies and have been looking for three of them everyone. So happy about this purchase.,1429401600,,102,4.421052631578948
6203107,4,B00HSHPYNG,"I had kind of remembered seeing the movie ""12 Monkeys"" when the TV series of the same name came on.  That is why I ordered this DVD so I could compare with the series.  I have to say the TV series has the nod from me over the movie with Bruce Willis.  The movie had too many unanswered questions and the TV series has more ways to go with the subject.",1428278400,,351,3.915492957746479

6203110,5,B00HSHPYNG,"I purchased this specifically for ""12 Monkeys,"" and received 3 extra movies as a bonus!  All four look great, and the ""12 Monkeys"" image and sound quality is outstanding.  Plus, all 4 DVDs come in one case only slightly thicker than a standard DVD case, which is very convenient and space saving.",1422489600,7,296,4.673076923076923
