Why, oh why are critics Pain Threshold  tested beyond a pleasant review. So often.

The cast of stars mentioned were filmed at DAYS OF DEAD convention and take the walk-on to a new level and yet they have a ad-libbed script and acknowledge the main character as having a back story,Best part of the flick.

The villianess is actually pretty,effective and menacing in her endeavorsLOL.

Some points to think on: MMP got distribution,the Sound is horrible,Most of the filming seems from a I-Phone lens and the murders were great,no really those moments rose above 95 % of film.",1408838400,,687,5.209090909090909
