And during my wonderful journey of discovering this fascinating genre of film I came across this gem and was nothing short of blown away by how terrific it is!

It starts with a superb script adapted from a first rate book and it just gets better from there!  Outstanding cast of gifted actors, gorgeous sets, and directed by a very gifted director.  I can't recommend it highly enough.

It might be a good idea to watch a few other KHD's so you'll understand the customs and historical settings first - Dong-Yi, Dae Jange Geum a/k/a Jewel in the Palace, Yi-San, to name a few.  And if you do watch Tree with Deep Roots and love it like I do be sure to watch this director's adaptation of Painter of the Wind another script from another book by the author of Tree...

Fair warning!  These are addictive!",1359936000,19,944,4.511764705882353
5298401,5,B009AHST9I,"Once things get going, it's a very enjoyable drama. There were times, on the weekend, I could not stop watching 'cause I wanted to see what happened next. The captions are good. I have found that sometimes, on any of the Korean dramas, I have to go back and pause to read them because there are times when the background is too close to the caption color.

Other than that little nit-pic, it's a very good drama.",1359244800,,412,4.35064935064935
5298402,5,B009AHST9I,"At the beginning of the Chosen Dynasty the written language used by the Korean people was Chinese characters,thousands of them that only the nobles had time to learn and use. The characters were symbolic and without relationship to the words used by the Korean people. King Lee Do,frustrated with the inability of his people to petition him and his inability to communicate to them imformation vital to them all,decided to establish an alphabet that reflected both the phonics of the Korean language and was easy to learn and use by everyone. This would upset the balance of power in the realm by allowing the ""great unwashed"" masses to have access to the government and to read and write whatever they chose,allowing even the commoners to enjoy reading whatever gave them pleasure. Thus began a long struggle by the king and a very small handful of supporters to build,from scratch,just such an alphabet,all in secret.
This historical Korean Drama (kdrama as they are known) is beautifully filmed and acted by first-rate quality actors, easily on par with US movie theater quality although it was shown on Korean TV and,just so you understand,the target audience is the Korean people;they have oft-times a difference of philosophy about how things should or do go and every story having an happy ending isn't one of them.
In several instances near the beginning,Chae-yoon would make drawing in a notebook and as he did,in the lower left of the screen,what he was drawing was being drawn on the screen. Another time,there was a scene someone was trying to make sense or rhyme out of hundreds of characters on stacks of paper when suddenly mental connection was made and the correct letters/symbols began to float up and began to form a thought. There are more than a few examples of the 3D graphics and special effects.
This series is not an ordinary series. It is in-depth,well-played and beautifully filmed,a first-rate effort in all respects.
Most highly recommended.",1356652800,6,1970,4.990881458966565
5298403,5,B009AHST9I,"This series was very interesting and the story drew me in. In the beginning I didn't like it as it has a bit too much screaming, but even that played into the story later, so stick with it. This tells a different twist to the story of the king who invented a different alphabet for his people to make language available to everyone, not just the aristocrats. It has a good dose of politics and intrigue, murder and cunning. The cast is excellent. I think Koreans are brilliant in how much they love their history. I have learned so much watching various dramas. I have added this to my every growing collection. Now that my favorite production company has shut down, I depend ever more on Amazon for a source of series to purchase. YA Entertainment production were so well done. I hope they have all joined other companies. The subtitles from YA had to be the best. I never had a bad experience with any of their translations. I can't say that of all other purchases. The worst is when the language changes from Korean to Chinese and the translation gets changed. YA never did that. I would like reccomendations for clean translations. This series was perfect in the English translation and subtitling.",1355875200,6,1202,4.621495327102804
5298404,4,B009AHST9I,"another intense classy period Korean TV drama - with bright lighting and colors - lavish costumes & sets - and some very good acting

while the story starts in the early 1400s - eventually it centers on the introduction of the Korean alphabet by SeJong the Great in the 1440s - but in order to make an exciting tv show out of that - large liberties with history were taken - and the emotions were amp'd up by some overwrought dialog

if you're not familiar with SeJong or the writing system - i suggest looking up the history after the drama - but definitely look it up - especially the amazing story of Sejong the Great

the main leads are a fictional young couple - an angry young swordsman - played in a very mannered style by Jang Hyuk - and a clever young women serving as a maid in SeJong's court - played by the lovely and fast-rising Shin Se Kyung

SeJong the Great - called by his birthname thru out the series - which is pronounced ""ee doe"" - but spelled ""Lee Do"" in the subtitles - is first seen as a man in his twenties - excellently played by Song Jung Gi (who used to be a regular in the korean tv reality show ""Running Man"") - then as a man in his forties - brilliantly played by korean superstar Han Suk Kyu

there are too many good actors to list - but i'll list one more for Kpop fans - and cuz his performance surprised me - in the role of a young scholar - Kim Ki Bum of Super Junior fame - who also lived many of his teen years in California

as with most period Korean dramas - there's continuous court intrigue - with the the two sides exchanging advantages - occasional Hong Kong style sword fights - it's very melodramatic at times - with long monologues - or dialog with long pregnant pauses - and a lot of repetition - the series could easily have been trimmed down from it's 24 episodes - but the continual tension and rapid developments made it feel like it went by fast

there was an hour long behind-the-scenes featurette that disappointed me by not  providing much information - altho some interaction with the supporting cast was fun

factoids -

written Korean is a phonetic alphabet like the Roman alphabet - but better

its introduction did create a backlash from the privileged classes whose power came from the reliance on the more difficult Chinese ideography

some cultural acts may be lost on foreigners - but there's one i don't want you to miss - when drinking from a cup or a glass - the drinker is expected to turn his head away from a person of higher age or rank

to sum up - this series not as great as the good king himself - but fascinating - nice to look at - well acted - what more could you ask for",1352592000,12,2651,4.236111111111111
5298405,5,B009AHST9I,"This drama series has it all. The best acting I've seen in a long time, an incredible (and deep) storyline, amazing sets and costumes, and just enough mystery, drama, suspense, action, and even some lighthearted moments. The endings of some of the episodes literally took my breath away. I wonder how anyone could write such an amazing story. This is a show I will watch multiple times. Highly recommended.",1347926400,6,406,4.898550724637682

The story is very engaging--murder mystery behind the creation of the Korean alphabet, clever! I'm always at the edge of my seat when watching this. The acting is phenomenal. Every actor is great here! I love it. The costumes are lavish, colorful, beautiful! Also, it's only 24 or 26 episodes long, not too long compared to other historical dramas but it's AMAZING!",1374019200,2,455,4.772151898734177
8538417,5,B009AHST9I,"It pressed all the right buttons.  The only thing it got wrong (minor, minor, only for the super-picky) is that, in the English subtitles, the royal family name should be Yi, not Lee.",1369353600,,183,4.545454545454546
8538418,4,B009AHST9I,Story was good. Tense and keep you in suspense. The only thing that troubles any viewer is the interpretation which is absolutely 'garbage'. That person does not know what he is talking about in English.,1364083200,,203,4.828571428571428
