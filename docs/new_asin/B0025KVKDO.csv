3848173,5,B0025KVKDO,"This show is GOOD...and one of the reasons is that it is a bit ""unusual"". I really enjoy Reaper also (another ""unusual"") but of course, it's gone too.
Why is it that they do not give some of these really good shows a chance anymore?  There have been very many shows in the past that took a couple of seasons to gain a larger audience, and then became hits. It's frustrating to see good shows get cancelled before they really have a chance, and some other's (barely watchable) go on. It just makes no sense at all to me.
  I do hope to at least be able to purchase a dvd of this ""cancelled too soon"" show.",1245196800,16,604,4.145299145299146
3848174,5,B0025KVKDO,"Really liked this show. Very disappointed that there will only be one
season but that seems to happen to a lot of shows I like, for instance
Wonderfalls and Firefly.
I liked the characters and their relationships with eachother. I also enjoyed
the humor. Sorry to see this one go.",1242604800,79,280,4.62
3848175,5,B0025KVKDO,"I LOVE this series!  It's like NYPD BLUE with humor and on acid!
Each episode has certainly lived up to the title and the characters' quirks drive the plots forward with a compelling ""drive-by"" momentum.  It's so good to see actors who have done great work in the past get such meaty roles---like Amber Tamblyn, Adam Goldberg, Terry Kinney, and Harold Perrineau (who is still my favorite Mercutio!)
This is one show I will definitely get when it becomes available on DVD.  ---Can't wait because I've missed an episode or two no longer available to view online.
Definitely worth the search on the ABC schedule.",1242172800,69,609,4.780952380952381
3848195,5,B0025KVKDO,"I have watched this on Crackle. The show seelessly blends both drama and comedy. Great cast with stellar performances. You will never see Renner acting. He is Walsh. The unusuals walks that fine line tween drama and comedy quite easily. If you are tired of cop shows that are all gore (and we have all seen them) this is your fix. Smart, funny but real.",1487635200,,353,4.446153846153846

3848199,5,B0025KVKDO,"I don't know if I would say this show was ""gritty"" however it was well worth buying. I just started to watch it, and judging from first impressions I would say it's awesome. It's unlike many cop shows (CIS, NCIS and etc...) the casting was done well. All in all I'd recommend it. I hate that it was canceled, it seems many wonderful shows end too soon now a days.",1478995200,,363,4.2
3848200,5,B0025KVKDO,This was a wonderful program.  This is the perfect (and I hardly ever use the word) blend of comedy and cop show. I re-watch the whole series about once every three months. Amber Tamlyn is a blend of Lucille Ball and Veronica Lake.  Anything with Jeremy Renner is OK by me.  The supporting cast is equally up for the challenge.  There is Eddie Alvarez who always refers to himself in the third person.  The born again Christian cop with a very dark past. The rest of the cast is equally up to the task.,1475712000,2,502,4.297872340425532
3848201,5,B0025KVKDO,"A really great series. I was not aware of it, I miss a lot of TV stuff, but found this short lived show and thought, why did it come and go so fast. A list of wonderful actors like Jeremy Renner, great story lines, love it. The seller did a great job of sending in the time line they gave me.",1475366400,,292,3.80327868852459
3848202,5,B0025KVKDO,"I love this show.  It was quirky and funny, but still had heart and I loved all of the characters.  I am torn between being sad that we don't have more seasons, and happy that Jeremy Renner went on to do some other really great work that I love.  This is a fun show to binge watch over a rainy lazy weekend and it's fun to go back and re-watch now and then too.",1460851200,,361,3.8513513513513513
3848203,4,B0025KVKDO,"Cute show!  Love Jeremy Renner in anything....but this was a pleasant surprise.  Great cast, but the acting and stories could have been a little more original and just better.  I can see why it only went one season.",1453075200,,215,4.605263157894737
3848204,5,B0025KVKDO,I loved this show and was very disappointed when it was cancelled. This was the first I'd seen of Jeremy Renner and I can see why his career took off. Now I see him everywhere. I have wondered if that was why the show wasn't continued as they'd have to kill Walsh off. Everyone on the show was excellent though and I would have continued watching. The other possible reason for it being cancelled was the name. I don't think people that like police shows would have caught on that it was about flawed detectives investigating crime. Maybe if they'd had a different name or if they had done a little PR/advertising. .,1451260800,,616,4.460176991150442

3848216,5,B0025KVKDO,"This is an all-time favorite. I still binge watch the show every couple of months/years. I was so disappointed when ABC yanked this midseason. Loved all the flawed offbeat characters and the smart, eclectic feel.",1444348800,,212,5.085714285714285
3848217,5,B0025KVKDO,"Highly recommend! Why was this canceled?? Excellent ensemble cast, believable, human, flawed, funny/quirky. Think younger Barney Miller cast meets Law and Order meets clever Starsky and Hutch with fewer car chases. Plus ...Jeremy (could listen to his voice all day) Renner, so, it's got that going for it. Writing puts fresh twist on the above references. Music in transition scenes is amusing all on its own. If they ever made a soundtrack from the show I might be tempted to purchase but alas...",1444262400,,497,5.0

3848221,5,B0025KVKDO,"I was one of the few to have watched this when it was originally broadcast. I thought it was the funniest thing on television at the time. It was too off-beat for the mainstream, apparently, since it was canceled. Every time I watch it again I realize the mediocrity of television these days. If you've never seen it, think Barney Miller meets Hill Street Blues with more humor and quirkier characters. You've got to love the dispatcher, she's the unseen comic genius of the show.",1438473600,2,480,4.658823529411765

3848223,3,B0025KVKDO,"These two stars Jeremy Renner and Anber Tamblyn deserved better scripts and this would have been five stars if it was more dramatic like Joan of Arcadia and less like Saturday Nite Live. The story was too farcical, in my view, and that what killed it.  Still these two actors make it worth getting if you like them.",1435708800,,315,4.431034482758621

3848240,5,B0025KVKDO,"A quirky series ahead of its time, ""The Unusuals"" follows a band of eccentric detectives through their daily lives, including one who is convinced he will die when he's 42 and wears his bullet-proof vest everywhere, one who is hiding his brain tumor diagnosis, one who only speaks of himself in the third person, and many more. Jeremy Renner is fabulous as the detective who owns a diner (and can't cook), who works hard to protect his friends and his city.

There's quirk, there's humor, and there's some serious discussion of humanity - in all its stupidity and wonderfulness. If you like ""Brooklyn 99"" that's on now, you'll probably enjoy this. I wish ""The Unusuals"" had been made now. I think it probably would have lasted longer...",1412294400,,736,4.7952755905511815

Amber Tamblin is terrific (as always) and the show is built around her. If you like shows with action and drama and a bit of quirky comedy, The Unusuals is for you!",1410048000,,358,4.279411764705882

3848245,5,B0025KVKDO,"Never saw or heard of this one before, but I enjoyed it's characters and the different types of cases they handled. Too bad it only lasted one season.",1408752000,,150,4.392857142857143
3848246,4,B0025KVKDO,"First let me say that this is not among my favorite cop shows (those would include NYPD Blue, The Shield, or Justified). None the less, I liked it and developed an investment in the characters. It is promoted as ""gritty"", but it is not--certainly compared to the aforementioned shows I like. What it is, is quirky. It has a good ensemble cast and together they created a likable show. The stand out character for me was Adam Goldberg's Detective Delahoy. Goldberg did a very good job. His relationship with his partner, Detective Banks, was fun to watch and Harold Perrineau did a good job portraying Banks. I do not ever remember ever seeing Kai Lennox before. I liked watching him and thought he did a good job, as well. I am sorry it did not make it beyond one season, though. Like I said, I developed an investment in the characters and would like to have seen more of their lives. Gritty, no--fun,--yes.
For an amazing one season wonder, I will highly recommend ""Kidnapped""--the complete series staring Jeremy Sisto. A totally amazing series that only went one season. I can not understand how that one could not have been picked a up for a second season. Now, this one is gritty. It is totally amazing. I found it by chance on Amazon. You guys should get that one. Very Highly Recommended.",1408665600,,1295,4.6103896103896105
3848247,4,B0025KVKDO,"Great series. Full of unusual characters. Very funny. But just not loved by mainstream America so it was cancelled. If you have an oddball sense of humour, you will like this series.",1407628800,,182,4.71875

3848249,5,B0025KVKDO,"And here we have a murdered show. They took a great cast, quirky characters, interesting episodes, and a great plot. They let us fall in love for 10 glorious episodes and then they ripped it out from under us. Gritty, quirky, and just plain fun.

I have no idea what they were thinking when they canceled this show. There was so much that could have been done with this show and its characters.

3848265,5,B0025KVKDO,".....develop a concept into a brilliant show and then cancel it after only one season.  This one is totally addictive - I watched all 10 eps in three nights.  Unfortunately, none of the plot threads were resolved, leaving me frustrated and even a bit angry.  IF they had at least wrapped up the loose ends I would be purchasing it, but I will not, as the series stands.

3848269,5,B0025KVKDO,"I am a really big fan of Jeremy Renner and Amber Tamblyn. While Amber's character is the main character, Jeremy is the zen Yoda of the cast. The humor is subtle and really great. I especially love the random dispatcher announcements.

I actually wasn't sure that I was going to love this while I was watching the pilot. All of the characters were a little strange and some outright over the top. However as the story unfolds you begin to invest in each of the characters and embrace their weird quirks. If you like things with subtle humor, then I would recommend this. It has random one liners, great situational humor, and that one guy that everyone likes to see get pranked.",1387843200,5,677,4.549180327868853
3848270,5,B0025KVKDO,"I only chose this show because of all the great reviews. It's really good!

Pros
It's well written. The first five minutes into it, I knew I loved the writers and the camera guys. The actors are good as well.

The characters are well developed and you just can't help but love that.

There are a lot of story lines going at once. The detectives are in pairs and one set is doing one thing while another is doing something else. AND then there are continuing story lines. I love all of that.

It is not foul language, foul behavior oriented. No disgusting stuff. I LOVE THAT. A cop show could go that wa y easily.

Be as t of all---it's funny!

Cons
Whoever decided to run the music full blast over the dispatcher should be shot. That writing is so great and I had to go back over a nd over again to get it. Soooooooooooo annoying!

The male lead is a little guy. Little guys don't work that well in the beefcake/bedroom scenes. I'm just saying.

The direction could be better now and then.

I have no idea why this show tanked. It should come back, with hotter guy!",1387843200,,1065,4.258706467661692

Basically, The Unusuals was Barney Miller, updated and done as an hour-long dramedy: terrific acting, amazing characters featured in quirky & fascinating plots.  It should have run for a very long time, to eventually become one of America's best-loved TV cop shows.  If you're not buying this DVD set... why not?

So sad that now a days we have so many of these ""reality"" shows and not enough of these types of shows. It's probably highly unlikely that they would get all these actors back together...

Adam Goldberg's character was my favorite, but overall I enjoyed the whole cast. I wish it had lasted for more than 10 episodes, but I'm glad that it was released on DVD so I can still enjoy it.

Yes, it is like a soap opera, where one expisode feed into the next, but that is what makes it so damn good.  The characters blend in to create an excellent patch quilt of drama laced with comedy.  With all the CRAP TV that is currently on, I have to wonder why this show was truly axed by the network.

Warning, if you are super serious, you may not like this. However, The UNUSUALS has depth, humor, mystery, and a lot of real-life interactions between the characters, and best of all, it makes you laugh, unexpectedly.  This is the kind of show you can watch more than once and catch small details that add to the humor.

I discovered this show after it was canceled (darn it!)--- via one of the online streaming sites & was Hooked. So I had to buy the DVD set. It is a quirky, engaging, fun, upbeat, show. My husband & I watched all 10 episodes and he loved it as much as I did. Each character has their own individual issues to deal with, and they do so with humor, but a realistic approach.

My favorite character is Detective Delahoy (love ya, Adam Goldberg!). But overall, I love all of the characters and interactions and relationships. I'm just disappointed there are only 10 episodes. Love the music tracks too. Gritty, edgy, different. This will be worth your time if you like things a bit off the beaten path.

Pay attention to the dispatcher, too.  It is so much more than just a ""cop"" show. This is not your Law & Order SVU, Cold Case, etc. It's in it's own class.

I want MORE!  PLEASE

Five episodes per disc is not an optimum video bitrate. Let's face it. They were too cheap to put the series on three DVDs.]

Maybe some of the characters were a little too kooky just for the sake of kookiness. Maybe if it had continued, it might have spun out of control, jumped the shark rather early. However, it is nice to see a cop show that isn't as formulaic as most. It had potential.

Frankly, this cancellation smacks of a very poor job of selling by the network. If you see the ratings, they start at 4.5 and decline to the low 3's. Looks for all the world as if the folks that showed up in the start where sold a different show than they got,...and so they left. If they had sold the ACTUAL product, and for bob's sake given it a chance as a very unique and quirky show to let the obvious support for it (see the reviews here and on netflix to see how well received it actually is once those who can deal with it got their hands on it) catch up. The real failure at the suit level was in the support for the show, and then not being able to discern that THEY where the problem, not the actual product. Instead of fixing the actually problem, they threw away another gem. That's what bottom line thinking gets us.

This storyline was not followed up and I think this was the key to why the show failed. It had some good characters and the storylines were fine but the main part of the show (Casey's undercover work) were just not followed up.

- Walsh: ""You mean like Jugs or Maxim?""

Same old, same old with the big television networks. Put on a promising show, cancel a promising show. ABC's appallingly short-lived THE UNUSUALS is the latest victim to fall prey to the arsebackward peccadillos of these program directors. Ten episodes are all we get, with plot threads hanging unresolved all over the place. Sad.

THE UNUSUALS takes up where LIFE left off, in terms of offbeat characters embedded in an intriguing police procedural. New York City detectives Casey Shraeger and Jason Walsh are our early eyes and ears to what makes this series tick, and it's Shraeger (Amber Tamblyn) towards whom we naturally gravitate as she's the newbie in the lot, what with her having just two seconds ago been reassigned from Vice to the 2nd Precinct Homicide Division. Shraeger is instantly thrown in the deep end, her new unit tapped to look into the murder of a very flawed police detective who turns out to be the old partner of Jason Walsh (Jeremy Renner), who is now Shraeger's new partner. But it's always perilous poking into a hornet's nest, and, o jaded us, it's not startling at all that Shraeger would inevitably catch a whiff of police corruption. One smug perp actually passes judgment on the 2nd Squad, mocking it as ""Chaotic. Disorganized. Too much personality. Not enough discipline."" He should've added ""dysfunctional.""

- Police Dispatcher: ""2nd Squad, this is Dispatch reminding you that handcuffs are for official police business only.""

Part of what makes this show so addictive is that all the characters seem to be nursing a secret or harboring a quirk. One detective constantly refers to himself in the third person (no one much likes this guy). Another officer is so easily spooked he sleeps with his bullet-proof vest. Amusingly, his partner tends to be so very reckless, and the episodes mine this odd couple dichotomy for tons of giggles. There's the former bad boy who found religion. And the former professional baseball player. Shraeger herself, we learn right away, is a closet Park Avenue princess with a mean trust fund. Shraeger just wants to fit in, doesn't want preferential treatment. She doesn't inform anyone she's posh. Secrets are part and parcel of the make-up of this homicide squad. As Walsh asks Shraeger:"" How can you trust someone who doesn't have secrets?"" I even got to wondering about the police dispatcher whose no-nonsense yet frequently hilarious on-radio communiques contribute yet one more offbeat color. I can't decide which of her broadcasts I like most.

- Police Dispatcher: ""2nd Squad, be advised: Female trapped in a port-a-potty in East River Park. This perfectly summarizes my last relationship.""

Amber Tamblyn and Jeremy Renner head up a fabulous cast which also includes the always memorable Adam Goldberg. THE UNUSUALS is seedy and gritty and funny and full of great character moments and that sense of easy camaraderie. There's a smattering of romance. It's certainly dramatically compelling. I don't know if the cases by themselves are interesting or if they're made interesting because it's these oddball detectives investigating them. The murder store (""One Man Band""). The brown bag pornographer whose film sets are residences of unwitting homeowners (""The E.I.D.""). ""The Dentist"" borrows a plot device from REAR WINDOW and a classic gag from CODE OF SILENCE, and it features a daring heist which takes place in the 2nd Precinct station. We see a 1313 go down, and that very hilarious Tape Delay maneuver. We learn of the mustache fraternity and the precinct's long-established bartering system of favors.

- Police Dispatcher: ""2nd Squad, this is Dispatch. It's a full moon tonight, people, and you know what that means. Anything can happen. Werewolves, succubi, giant robots fighting in the street. Proceed with caution.""

THE UNUSUALS - THE COMPLETE SERIES collects all ten episodes and comes in two DVDs. The single bonus feature on disc is ""On Set with the THE UNUSUALS"" which I guess serves as the Behind-the-Scenes look into the thing. It runs at 5 minutes, 24 seconds. There's also a leaflet insert with very brief synopsis of the episodes. So it's got that going for it. What we're also left with are dangling plot threads. So what happens to Delahoy? Will Cole ever 'fess up to his partner about what he did? Will Banks ever turn 43? And so forth. I realize that the big three networks have to compete now with cable, and that it's ultimately about the bottom line, which is that THE UNUSUALS simply weren't drawing in the sexy Nielsen ratings. But, geez, what ever happened to those days when a network would nurture a fledgling show, give it room to grow and find its audience?

3848422,5,B0025KVKDO,"This show unfortunately can only live on in the hearts and minds of fans and new fans alike. When it first aired, I was immediately intrigued by the sense of humor, witty exchanged, and fantastic choice of actors. As I continued to watch it, I fell in love with the whole package. The main characters themselves were an incredible mix of wonderfully flawed human beings. My favorite duo was that of Det. Leo Banks (Harold Perrineau) and Det. Eric Delahoy (Adam Goldberg). The former believe that, as many of his male relatives have died at the age of 42, and his birthday recently passed, that his number is up--which makes him completely paranoid of everything. His partner, on the other hand, may or may not have a brain tumor, but definitely has a death wish.

Then they just replace them with shows that are not smart but offer them immediate gratification, meaning easy $$$.  I wonder how silly they felt when Jeremy Renner was nominated for an Oscar.  I do not watch ABC at all.  Nothing on ABC, not their reality shows; not their dramas; nor their sitcoms are worthy of my time anymore.",1270857600,3,638,4.642857142857143

However, the great acting more than makes up for it.  I found every episode to be engrossing!  This is one of my favorite shows.",1270684800,4,443,4.905405405405405
3848448,4,B0025KVKDO,"The box The Unusuals comes in claims the series is ""dark and gritty."" This is a flat-out lie. There's nothing gritty about The Unusuals at all. But this is a good thing.

Sony Pictures is just afraid you won't buy this if you don't think it's a duplicate of every other cop show made in the last twenty years. ABC feared the same and mis-marketed the comedy as a hard-boiled grimefest. Unsurprisingly, it tanked in the ratings. But what does exist of it is fortunately available now.

Normally, I don't go for cop shows, but this one stood out to me. It's about the characters -- true to the title, everyone working at the precinct is UNUSUAL in some way. Amber Tamblyn steals the series as Casey Shraeger, a stereotype-defying smartmouthed heiress who wants to pursue her own interests (and attempts to keeps her true identity secret for much of the series). Harold ""WHERE'S MAH BOOOOOOOOOOOYYYYYYYYYY?"" Perrineau plays a paranoid detective convinced he's fated to die within one year. (We never get to find out if that's true.) Other cast members range from a former baseball pro to a sergeant who really wanted to be an astronaut but discovered he was afraid of heights. The cases they get handed are also suitably bizarre.

Tamblyn prophetically said in an interview that the series could run into problems for ""being so unique."" For those who are tired of network factory entertainment and want to see a show unafraid to break the mold, I recommend the ten episodes of The Unusuals. Woe that there aren't any more, but I fear if it had gone on, ABC might have tried to turn it into the depressing thing they were selling it as.",1270684800,23,1632,4.659722222222222

3848451,5,B0025KVKDO,"Alas, canceled.

As the other reviewers have mentioned, if you like a show with believable characters, solid relationships, intelligent humor, and both good single-episode plots and meta-arc, you'll love this show. It's pretty thin on the slapstick, bodily function 'humor', and blatant sex acts, so i guess that's why it got canceled.

The Unusuals is a police/crime drama, but it's much more character-driven than crime-driven. It's not a police procedural like Law & Order, or a cops vs. bad guys show like NYPD Blue. It's a show about cops, mostly while on the job, and they're very strange people. In the first season you get to know all of the characters well enough to be furious at the end of the last episode. So much is left unfinished.

(If it helps you figure out what kind of show this is by what other shows i like, then here's a list: Wonderfalls, Firefly, SportsNight, Space: Above and Beyond, and Castle. Funny how only one of those is still on the air...)",1270166400,9,973,4.711764705882353

Thank you Amazon !
Why was this show ever cancelled in the first place???  Another really good series that saw only one season was ""Women's Murder Club"".  I believe that was ABC, also!  That series is from the books by James Pattterson.
Well, we can be thankful for one thing...another series of this genre is looking quite successful and it's called ""Castle"". Let's hope ABC doesn't see this and move on to cancelling ""Castle"".",1268006400,8,743,4.826771653543307

3848486,5,B0025KVKDO,"The police procedural is a show that has been made and remade more than a couple of times, covering everything from the detectives working cases as in the ""Law and Order"" franchise, to the forensics of the investigations such as in ""CSI"" and its spinoffs. These shows are mostly dramas, dealing with the motivations and conflicts of the people investigating these cases, but comedic police dramas have also been attempted with varying success rates. Often these ""police comedy dramas"" are more than a little formulaic, seldom venturing beyond what the characters feel about the case of the week or the romantic tension between the female and male leads. These shows aren't necessarily bad, and they fare well with general audiences due to their ""safe"" nature, but their derivative nature can become tiresome for those who have seen more than a few police dramas and know the ropes. ""The Unusuals"" is one of those shows that comes along to defy these conventions, with a snappy sense of humor that dares to be absurd, distinct quirky characters with complex motivations, pasts, real personal problems, and some very involving drama.

 ""The Unusuals"" deals with the humorous chaos and often grounded reality of the lives and work of the detectives in the second precinct police station in New York. Detective Casey Shraeger (Amber Tamblyn) of the NYPD is transferred from Vice (short for ""Vice Unit"", which investigates matters such as narcotics, pornography, and in this case prostitution) working undercover as a prostitute, to the second precinct in order to do internal affairs house cleaning at the request of precinct commander Sergeant Harvey Brown (Terry Kinney) who believes the fact she comes from a wealthy family yet decided to become a police officer makes her incorruptible. She is paired with Detective Jason Walsh (Jeremy Renner) as her partner and begins investigating the death of Walsh's former partner who was a crooked cop.

 The precinct's detectives turn out to be quite the colorful bunch: Walsh once played major league baseball, yet stopped playing and became a cop. Detective Henry Cole (Joshua Close) is a devout christian who has a dark criminal past and once lived by another name. Detective Allison Beaumont (Monique Gabriela Curnen) is Cole's partner, who has been having problems with her rent due to a perp suing her for breaking his neck. Detective Eric Delahoy (Adam Goldberg) is a mustachioed loner who's been diagnosed with brain cancer and is refusing to seek treatment or confide in anyone due to having nobody close to him. Delahoy's partner Detective Leo Banks (Harold Perrineau) is obsessed with not dying at 42 years old, like his father and grandfather did for inexplicable reasons, and wears a bulletproof vest at all times. Detective Eddie Alvarez (Kai Lennox) isn't paired with anyone, and in fact barely knows the names of his fellow officers after spending a full year at the station due to him thinking of himself as a lone wolf, and his snobby, bureaucratic nature. On top of that, Eddie Alvarez likes to speak about ""Eddie Alvarez"" in third person.

 Throughout the run of the show each of these characters grow and develop in meaningful ways, their cases often forcing them to confront their own problems and change as people. During all of this you'll never lose sight of their humanity, they feel guilt, pain, anger, and fear in a very real way, and are often reluctant to change or reach out. Their witty and sometimes crude banter draws you closer and makes the dramatic moments in the show stand out all the more clearly. Even Alvarez changes for the better and learns he can, and will often need to, lean on his fellow officers for help and support. The characters, their pasts, and their development is simply brilliantly written and very well executed by a competent cast.

 Interestingly enough, there are a few less than great things about the show which are mostly minor, but still present. First and foremost, the pilot episode simply had too many characters and plot elements to introduce, and the tone was perhaps a touch too silly. The first episode is fair, but it's not the show's best as it's lacking in the drama department, and is a somewhat weak starting point which may drive potential viewers away (in which case, it's their loss). Another problem is that the intro, which is fairly simplistic with a synth trumpet musical background, is perhaps a bit too simplistic and a tad bit cheesy, which sometimes contrasts a bit too sharply with the openings of the more dramatic episodes. It's kind of weird to have the semi-cheesy theme playing immediately after a supporting character has been shot in a diner robbery. Aside from that, the music which plays during aerial shot transitions between scenes can also be iffy at first, but it'll grow on you after you ""get"" the New York feel of the show.

 The Unusuals is an unusually refreshing breath of fresh air with its deep characters, its punchy humor, and the perfect balance of the two that the show delivers If you can get past the rocky first episode, you'll find a unique thoroughly rewarding show waiting for you in the following episodes. As of the time of writing (2/26/2010) I'm eagerly waiting to purchase to box set, and hoping this show will be renewed and not become another firefly.",1267142400,25,5319,4.913140311804009

I fell in love with Jeremy Renner after watching The hurt Locker (3x now) so I decided I would check out this show. I ended up buying it on iTunes and flew thru the series in a day and a half. The cast is steller, and I found myself cracking up through most of the episodes. And while Detective Walsh (Renner) was my favorite character, you know its a great cast when your favorite characters rotate depending on the episode. What I really want to know is how the characters end up.
