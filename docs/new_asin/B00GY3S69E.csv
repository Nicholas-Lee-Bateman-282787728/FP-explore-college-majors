6124084,4,B00GY3S69E,"This was a fine series and surprisingly educational at times. What sadly sullies the series is all the fan service. It is made worse by the fact that the girls are like 12 years old. I personally do not enjoy seeing half naked 12 year olds, but other then that the show itself was good.",1417046400,,286,4.218181818181818

6124086,4,B00GY3S69E,The idea behind Upoote is very interesting. How could a weapon be anthropomorphised? So you end up with middle school girls who are weapons such as the M16 personified as young girls. There are some fun double entendres and verbal jokes and hints at a plot. The main villains are all variants of the Ak-47 (kalash-kock-offs anyone?). It's a bit of a shame that the plot elements feature in only four of the episodes. If you like fan service then this has a lot of it. But with the fan service and puns this comes very close to Lolita. The new teacher who is mentioned in the summary on the box doesn't really feature in the stories that much and I think they missed an opportunity with not discussing the back stories of some of the teachers at the school. You do have to feel sorry for L85A1 though.,1404518400,4,800,4.375838926174497
6124087,5,B00GY3S69E,"For fan of shows that are full of fun and hijinks like Azumanga or Cromartie.  Also a gun enthusiast will get a kick out of how the characters traits stem from the characteristics of the various guns they represent.  Sure there's a hefty helping of perversion mixed in, but what gun owner doesn't feel a little love for his/her favorite rifle.",1400198400,2,343,4.60655737704918
6124088,3,B00GY3S69E,"It has a ok dub and really no story at. It's pretty much all filler episodes, with 10 episodes of random stories. Might be worth watching if you're bored and don't want to follow a story at all.",1393632000,6,194,4.131578947368421
6124089,4,B00GY3S69E,"Its the first day of work for the new Japanese literature teacher at a prestegous all girls school.  On his way, he meets one of the students, Funco who helps him find his way to the campus, and discovers this middle grade school girl wearing unusual clothes for her age.  The next day he watches as the girls in his homeroom are doing something that normal girls do not - shoot targets.  he then meets Funco again, only to say the wrong thing and gets shot at by her.  Thats when he learned these lethal cuties are the human representations of actual guns, and many of them have hair trigger tempers.  But despite being lethal weapons, these girls also have the normal issues girls of their age have, friendships, gossip, and of course crushes - but also unusual problems, like loose pants (shaky stock), breaking firing pins (stomachaches), and a lot of misfires.  Can this normal teacher be able to adapt to his new students, or will he be turned into swiss cheese by a certain trigger happy cutie?

I just finished this online and have to admit it was an unusual story.  Mostly you have girls WITH guns, not ARE guns, but each one of the girls have their own personality, are well developed and their interactions are fun to watch.  I love the fact they break the school groups into the three main classes elementary (submachine), middle school (assault), and high (main battle rifle) and put a lot of the history and research of each particular weapon.  This was only a ten episode series, and does leave a few questions open (like what happens when they graduate - do they upgrade to the next level?), but it is one that you need to watch.",1392854400,13,1645,4.527027027027027

8628622,2,B00GY3S69E,"I really wanted to like this series. I really did. However, several things just kept me facepalming all the way through to the end of the series. So, before anyone decides to troll me over not liking this, yes, I did watch the series in its entirety and with the Japanese language with English subtitles.

Watching any anime, or animation for that matter, requires you to ""suspend your disbelief"" to a point. ""Suspension of disbelief"" is what allows people to watch something and just accept what they're seeing as simply entertainment. That's the most succinct way I can think to describe it. If you push that suspension too far or try to hold their mind to a realistic premise while stretching their ""suspension of disbelief"" like taffy, it breaks the connection from your audience and causes them discomfort or irritation at what they're seeing. There's a real science behind this whole thing, but that's the quick-and-dirty way of putting it.

""Uppote!!"" basically sets itself up as an anime high-school comedy, but with adorable/sexy (the levels of which get very disturbingly mixed) high school girls. I know a lot of anime has this sort of setup (minus the guns part), but this series takes it into the ditch in a creepy and pervy way. You can take that fanservice premise to different series and make it work under the right conditions. With this series, it doesn't work, it just comes off as some creeper's safe jailbait and gun fetish disguised as a Saturday morning cartoon. This is why I find a show like ""Queen's Blade"" more entertaining and ultimately less irritating to watch than this. Queens Blade is nothing but hokey and stupidly vague plot and fanservice everywhere. The plot of QB is very basic and doesnt leave much to the imagination (in more ways than one). However, it works. Uppote!! tries to do this, dumbs down the fanservice, makes it a cutesy modern highschool for girls, and then throws in some sort of worldwide or country-wide competition premise that in any other anime would work fine.

Where Uppote!! fails the hardest is the premise that these high school girls are somehow the anthropomorphic representations of firearms. Specifically, these girls are supposed to be personification of assault rifles. That by itself makes my brain hit the brakes and screech to a halt.

It gets further brain-jarring when you are shown in the early minutes of the first episode that the girls, who are supposed to be anthropomorphic assault rifles, shooting the respective rifles they are named after. Yes, the characters are named FNC, M-16, Sig Sauer 552, and so-on. They manifest health problems as a way to personify broken parts (broken firing pins and stuff like that). What is even stranger is that they personify a skeletonized stock, in the case of the character FNC, as her wearing thong underwear. (Which they make sure to cut away from before you actually see it. So you don't see anything, its just told via in-scene dialogue.)

Wait What?!

It makes zero sense and only serves to further disconnect the audience from the characters.

On another note, the episodes are all disjointed and disconnected from each other except the last few episodes. You can show pretty much any of the episodes in random order and not get lost.

Furthermore, they throw in some nonsense about a competition between rival schools and such that doesnt really seem go anywhere other than to give the characters an excuse to do more shooting or something. This competition brings in the main antagonist of the series. Suddenly, for no real reason it is established that characters who are anthropomorphized AK (Kalashnikov) variants are inherently evil. The only real exception to this rule is Galil-chan, modeled after the Israeli IWI Galil rifle, who is just a complete ditz who is just along for the ride and does what she wants for kicks. This incomprehensible miasma of a plot finally culminates when the characters are on a school trip and suddenly the whole city they are visiting is turned into a warzone by all the AK characters (again, somehow Kalashnikovs are somehow all inherently evil) who are wearing fox masks and pink/red schoolgirl sailor uniforms and talking with very monotone robot voicesfor some reason. Literally, the vast majority of this series, you can mention anything and just tack for some reason onto the end of each statement, and it would be easier to understand. The battle rages for several episodes. Were supposed to feel something when characters appear to sacrifice themselves, or endure hardships, but at the end of the series everything is all wrapped up in a bow, thus we end the series right back where we started at the school. Nothing has really changed. Nobody has really learned much of anything. The whole series ends, not with a bang, but on a whimper.

Thats what you are in for with regards to the bare-bones plot that this series has.

Where the series finally just deflates and ultimately fails completely is in talking about firearms. Now, sure you can argue that Japan has really strict gun laws, so pretty much no one in Japan has access to the firearms in question to feel them out and make this series, let alone try to give you any info on guns. Any verifiable facts are things you can find in a Wikipedia article, or based on what you can assume the writers read from other folks experience with these firearms was.

Heres the most prime example in the series. The character of the British SA80 is pictured as a bumbling screw-up who constantly is breaking, having malfunctions, and needs to go to the nurses office all the time. Yes, the original SA80 is a crap rifle compared to some others, but the series takes the hiccups with the SA80 to an extreme and unheard of level. If the average SA80 had as many problems as the character in this series had, Im pretty sure they wouldnt be in service. Many places around the internet have confirmed that the second generation SA80s, while they aren't perfect, they are much better and more reliable. Which should be mentioned as the Gen IIs have been in service since long before this series was made!

Likewise, on the other end of the spectrum, the Sig Sauer 552 character is pictured as being perfect in every way shape and form. True, the Sig 552 is good. Is it perfect? Not exactly. Sig is pretty notorious for long wait times on replacement parts if you live outside of their native Switzerland. Also, they don't have the greatest track record of customer service if you ask some of the folks I know. (If youve had better luck with them, good for you. My experience isn't necessarily representative of everyones interactions with them.)

So, yeah, if you're going into this series to learn anything about guns, firearms, or general military small-arms hardware, you're going to be disappointed. If you're going into this looking for nudity and sexy anime fanservice, you're going to be disappointed. If you're going into this looking for exciting action, you're going to be disappointed. If you're going into this looking for a good or even cohesive story, you're going to be disappointed.

Overall, the series has some moments that are mildly entertaining. However, Im not sold on the show. It was too cutesy and hokey for my taste. Given the content and the premise, I would have expected more action, a bit grittier storytelling, and an altogether more cohesive plot and narrative to pull it all together. Unfortunately, they had none of those things, which caused the show to become boring and ultimately unentertaining.

Skip this show. Dont even bother with it. If you want fanservice anime, go watch Queens Blade, or Sekirei, or something else.",1468195200,,7673,4.842105263157895
8628623,5,B00GY3S69E,"As a military and history buff as well as an anime fan, I have greatly enjoyed the fairly new genre of military anime, something that would have been unthinkable back when anime first began in the 1960's because of the still raw feelings about WWII.  Even today the topic is controversial, which is one of the reasons I believe that military anime is often so downright odd, and I really thought I'd seen it all.  I've seen armored tank combat portrayed as a traditional Japanese feminine art and high school sport for girls:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Girls-Und-Panzer/dp/B00EZ228GI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Girls Und Panzer</a>.

I've seen naval combat of the Pacific Theater of WWII refought by Ship Girls who go into battle with weaponry of the ships they (reincarnate?) strapped to their bodies:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kancolle-Kantai-Collection/dp/B06XS23R7C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kancolle: Kantai Collection</a>.  I've even seen the modern JSDF pitted against a magic filled world and fire breathing dragons:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gate/dp/B06XSFCN2H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gate</a>.  But I have never, no, not ever, seen ANYTHING like this!

Somewhere in Japan there is a mysterious school called the Seishou Academy where all of the girl students, not to mention the faculty, are anthropomorphized guns, training to one day become useful weapons.  That's right, this isn't girls with guns, it's girls ARE guns.  The personalities and characteristics of the girls match those of the guns they anthropomorphize (for example since the Belgian FN FNC assault rifle has a skeleton stock, Funco the girl wears a thong instead of panties; commenting on this out loud will result in a fusillade of fully automatic gunfire).  The girl/guns are divided up by caliber rather than by age.  Thus, the 7.62 mm battle rifles are the high school girls, the 5.56 mm assault rifles are the middle school girls, and the pistol round firing submachine guns are the grade school girls.  (It's unclear what the boy students are.)  Into this surreal situation wanders a human Japanese teacher who has been reassigned to this school, and it is largely through his eyes that we learn how this crazy school operates and at the same time learn about modern military firearms, their strengths and weaknesses, and how to properly use them on the battlefield.  This series is an astonishingly well written combination of laugh out loud lunacy from the schoolgirls you least want to have a crush on you or to make angry and basic, useful information about the select fire weaponry that defines the modern infantry battle.  For example I learned a neat trick for controlling the recoil of a biped equipped battle rifle using one's toes, and while it is doubtful I shall ever have use for this knowledge, because it was taught me by a cute anime girl, I shall never forget it.  (Perhaps future military training can make use of this technique.)  In particular the kind of person who uses the term ""assault weapon"" to refer to a scary looking deer rifle could learn a lot.

Note: The 10 episode series is a blast with three great gun battles in episodes 2, 5-6, and 9-10; however, I was disappointed by the OVA episode in which not a lot happened beyond breast baring not shown in the regular series.",1465603200,,3710,5.702359346642468
