8162780,4,B000LP50TA,"Chen Zheng Lei is a living relative of the original Chen Style family lineage originator and is a consummate grand master. He would be at least 8th dan or higher in a Japanese system ranking. The dvd starts off with several survey type demos of different ""katas"" if you will or sets. Then the Qigong begins basic but very, very powerful demonstrated by a man that has practiced literally hundreds and thousand of hours. Practice makes perfect. The dvd is not perfect by western standards and could at times have had a sportier format but all in all a must have for any serious student of Taijiquan or martial arts in general. Tai chi may look slow and ""weak"" compared to the ""hard"" styles, but sped up from someone who has developed real chi and kung devastatingly lethal! This review is for the actual dvd and does not reflect on seller?s on amazon.com. The authentic version is available at yesasia (dot) com and a variety of sellers like Powereast on ebay!",1229904000,2,959,4.614035087719298
8162781,1,B000LP50TA,"Most definitely not a tai ji dvd, it contains a grainy black and white no name chinese film...the seller is misrepresenting this item",1207267200,3,133,4.826086956521739
8162782,1,B000LP50TA,"I ordered a copy of this DVD to learn Chen taiji silk-reeling exercises.

When the DVD came, it did not contain taiji, but a grainy B&W Chinese movie. I even tried it on the multistandard DVD player at work, same deal -- no hidden taiji files in Region 6 Chinese format.

Amazon was great and sent me a replacement, but it was just the same

Chinese movie, no taiji. I requested a refund after the second bad copy.

I don't think I'd order another from this taiji series provider, too risky.",1180051200,3,491,4.362637362637362
