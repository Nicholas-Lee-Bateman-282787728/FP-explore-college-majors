1425855,5,B00005IC54,"This is one of the tightest movies I have ever seen. I give it a definate 5 star rating. Boondock Saints is not filled with gaudy SFX or anything, just a solid story with some tight shoot-outs. Not only is there action, but it's extremely funny too. If you haven't seen this movie see it....NOW!",988588800,,295,4.381818181818182
1425856,5,B00005IC54,"I was in the video store one day, and out of sheer desperation, and nothing left on the shelves, I picked this movie up. Was searching for it on the internet all day the next day !! Great movie about two religious brothers turned vigilante, with the help of a whacky friend. This movie sure is much more than a shoot'em up, but theres plenty of that too. Laughs, action, drama, it has it all. Willem dafoe plays the craziest character I have ever seen, a detective, but well done. This movie was almost scrapped, I believe because it was due to come out around the whole columbine thing, and a major studio dropped it (forget who) but the director found another company to pick it up. See if you can find this info online, its pretty interesting. anyway, if you like movies like resevoir dogs, and others that take a different road than most, you will love this movie!!",987638400,,869,4.4375
1425857,4,B00005IC54,"The above words cannot ring more true. The Boondock Saints is an AMAZING movie. Personally I am glad the screenwriter did not let the movie industry decide who was to play the main characters.. If that would have happened, the entire movie would have been worthless.
I liked this movie better than The Matrix, and ""Crouching Tiger.."" combined. It is a DEFINATE must-see. If you are worried about the steep pricing on it, rest assured it is not without good cause. The publisher has a tight grip on who they sell to. (smart move in my book). I saw it once and bought it immediatly.",987465600,4,580,4.533333333333333
1425858,5,B00005IC54,"After seeing this movie once it became one of my favorites. At times it is somewhat Pulp Fictionish, and it seems like a shootem' up but its not. it has almost too much plot. The music goes along with the movie perfectly. It is very powerful in that it plays with the emotions. I put this movie up with American Beauty, which is one of my other favorite movies.",987379200,,361,4.246376811594203
1425859,5,B00005IC54,"1st of all, if you're not irish, no one is perfect
but this move is bad arse: funny and lotsa gun fighting its bout these 2 irish brothers that are devout catholics believing they receive a calling from god to exterminate all bad people (sinners) they have help from a guy named rocko nicknamed the funny man who has some real good jokes to tell funny movie and action packed trust me you won't be dissapointed (plus this movie isn't too well known so you can impress your friends with this one)",987379200,,495,4.391304347826087
1425860,5,B00005IC54,"Fraternal twins, the MacManus brothers turn vigilante in this hidden gem of a movie.  It's dark, it's suddenly violent, and it's even funny at times.  But the best part is that with Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus as the heavily accented strict Irish Catholic brothers, it is about as sexy as you can get.  Defoe gets star billing as a homosexual overachieving detective and Billy Connolly makes a surprise appearence, but it's the brothers that make this one of those movies you'll be glad you found.  Be the first on your block to see it, and spread the word.  Your friends will think you know ALL the good movies and wonder how you found it!",987379200,4,651,4.577586206896552

1425862,4,B00005IC54,"Boondock Saints is a title rooted in heavy philosophical issues, such as ""Does the justice system truly work?"" and ""Why not let the people take the law into their own hands?"".  Yet, Boondock Saints borders masterfully between staying true to it's subject and not becoming bogged down in the issue.  Funny, clever, cunning, and sometimes shocking, Boondock Saints delivers a captivating story, superbly written and artfully acted.",987292800,,429,5.388059701492537
1425863,5,B00005IC54,"The film ""Boondock Saints"" far surpasses most Hollywood productions from the outset simply by incorporating a plot different from the mainstream.  Although the film contains the usual amount of violence and killing for an action movie, this film has the merit that the motive for the murders is very clear, and quite possibly justifiable.  The social and moral questions raised throughout the film cannot help but elicit at least some critical thought.  But don't worry about being forced to think too hard; the film is routinely punctuated by witty dialogue and amusing circumstances.  The main characters, two selfless Irish brothers and a stray Italian, have delightfully good hearts and are endearing from the start.  Willem DeFoe puts forth one of his best performances ever, adding creativity to his rough and tough character by portraying an extremely self-assured gay FBI agent who doesn't quite admit his sexual orientation to himself.  His character is an excellent addition to the underlying religious theme of the movie as it pronounces the question of what purpose religion should serve, other than to provide moral direction.  The film is a must see for anyone who wants to determine what is truly morally correct, as well as anyone who just likes to watch a couple of nice Irish lads following their calling.",987206400,22,1323,5.125581395348838
1425864,5,B00005IC54,"While most people have never even heard of this film before, I do not hesitate to recomend it.  A small film, but in the best tradition of thrillers such as desperado, and ""lock, stock and two smoking barrels.""  If you want a film that has a good amount of action, comedy, and a film that defines brotherhood your search should stop here.",987206400,,338,4.435483870967742

1425881,5,B00005IC54,"This is a cult classic. For those giving it 1 star ratings, you really don't get the jist of the movie, so go back to boy meets girl fliks. This is a bloody, action packed, fun movie. Lots of action, with the twist of they keep trying to do it as if they were making a B rated movie. I have this and All Saints Day in my collection of blue-rays. Its worth the watch, but be warned, there is a lot of action, so this isn't a ""when harry met sally"" movie. There will be bloodshed, lots of gun fights, and some adult humor. It isn't meant to be taken serious, its a fun movie with lots of bloodshed.",1524355200,,596,3.975
1425882,3,B00005IC54,"It is not a bad movie, just dated.  William Daefoe fanning as a gay  man is the second stupidest thing in this movie.  Its OK, but it is dated. Very 1990's.  Trite and over played.",1524268800,,180,4.057142857142857
1425883,5,B00005IC54,"Excellent.  If it's possible to create an original cop/mafia movie, this is it.  Willem Dafoe is campily fantastic, while the other two main characters are earnestly business like as they decide how to met out justice.  The supporting actors are high caliber as well.  Great, unexpected ending.  This one is highly recommended.",1524009600,,327,5.211538461538462

1425896,2,B00005IC54,"If you haven't seen ""Overnite"", the documentary about Writer/Director Troy Duffy, you should maybe watch that first before ""Boondock Saints"". The basic story is, Troy is, I believe, working in a restaurant/bar and meets Harvey Weinstein, yes THE Harvey Weinstein, and gets his movie script read, and amazingly not only gets signed, but is allowed to direct! His ego goes way out of control and Harvey basically stops taking his calls and drops him. The reason for the word ""confusing"" in my title is because in my opinion, years later when the movie finally gets made, as far as I remember, the movie is pretty corny and not very good, so reading all of these 5 star reviews and ""best movie ever"" has me thinking that Troy Duffy got all of his buddies to wind everybody up. When you see what he's like in the doc you can see it's probably not beyond him. Now it's been a long time since I watched it, maybe I'll give it another chance, but this really has me wondering about the validity of Amazon reviews.",1521849600,,1006,4.532967032967033
1425897,5,B00005IC54,A Cult Classic you must watch on St. Patty's Day. If you're tired of the same old story line of the boy gets the girl after proving himself a hero then this is the movie for you. It's gritty and has a real feel to it. Enjoy yourself.,1521763200,,233,3.875
1425898,2,B00005IC54,Not really a good movie IMO. I thought the acting was sub par. The plot was not good. I'm not sure why this movie is so popular.,1521590400,,128,3.7777777777777777

Only one warning to those that haven't watched it.  It has a lot of violence so some discretion if you don't want young ones to watch violent movies yet.  Otherwise I recommend it.

Like most fables/stories there is an important point to this:  Be a good person, do not be like be like so many people that claim to be good people and are indifferent to the cries for help.  The indifference of good people are one of the reasons the world has become how it is.
Power and Greed are most likely the others.",1521244800,,729,4.194244604316546

It's definitely not a film for skeptics or those who expect 100% realism being displayed. This is most certainly the movie for people who enjoy analyzing situations, both in an abstract manner, as well as physical and psychological appreciation of what is being portrayed.

This movie is as provocative as it is entertaining, and when you are done laughing you will find yourself thinking.  In a time when so many Americans seem to have difficulty recognizing right from wrong; when those who claim to care most about their religion and their morality are willing to excuse any behavior that benefits their personal interests, this film about vigilantism surprisingly manages to offer lessons in integrity.  While no credible thinker would suggest that vigilantism has any legitimate place in a civilized society, the idea that we all share a duty to stand up for what is right is something we need more of if our ""great experiment"" will succeed in earning the respect of future generations.",1517097600,,819,5.0

The William Dafoe character could have been interesting had it not been a shambolic collection of gay/trans stereotypes that started out as a wan caricature and descended into farce from there. A supremely awful movie. I don't even know what Billy Connolly thought he was doing in it, earning a few grand probably. Somehow, according to IMDB, this movie has made it to cult status. In this case I'm going to assume that means that discerning viewers gave it a wide berth and left it to become a favorite of basement dwellers. I've never given a movie one star before but this was just a miserable slog from beginning to an end that couldn't come quickly enough.

1425969,3,B00005IC54,Viewers who like humorous films that border on silliness will enjoy this film about two brothers who think God wants them to kill Boston's underworld. The film begins when the two young men hear their priest preach that people should not be indifferent to evil. Examples of comedy bordering on silliness are an FBI officer ordering a police officer to get him a specially made coffee while he puts earphones on to hear classical music while he views the crime scene and he moves about in an almost dance fashion to the music. Another example is one of the young men want to light a cigarette while he is wearing a mask and has great difficulty doing so.

It has no plot, amateur writing, and characters that behave irrationally and in unbelievable ways. There is a lot of overacting, particularly by Willem Dafoe, who is usually good to great. The so-called story starts well enough, but quickly becomes absurd, until the movie is just one preposterous fight scene after another. And despite attempts to emulate Tarantino, none of it is innovative, edgy, or clever. In sum, a third-rate exploitation flick that will leave you feeling a little tainted by violence for its own sake and a lot like you just wasted your time.",1494547200,,718,4.798387096774194

The cinematography is absolutely beautiful. The way it's shot is visually stunning.

The scene behind the rolling credits at the end gives a strong introspective about the role media plays in modern society. It makes the whole movie even better.

The premise is a little far fetched. But it's a movie. If you want reality, go outside.

If you have not seen this cult classic movie, you need to stop reading this review and start watching it now. It is the greatest movie of all time. Every single person has thought about making the world a better place by killing evil people. Plus, the acting is wonderful. The plot is fantastic. The characters are deep.

I give it a thumbs up and it's worth watching more than once. I'd gladly watch it again and it had my undivided attention the first time.",1485734400,,456,4.364705882352941

1426448,3,B00005IC54,"This is an eighteen year old movie that I'd never gotten around to see. I'd heard of it before, but didn't really know what to expect. My daughter told me it is now considered a ""cult"" movie, and I can see that. Basically it's a good versus evil revenge fantasy/dark comedy movie. Two Catholic brothers, Sean Patrick Flannery and Noman Reedus (a very young Daryl from ""The Walking Dead"") are out to murder all the bad guys they encounter. They are initially stalked by a flaming-gay FBI agent William Defoe, who realizes they are purging the city of Boston of evil and decides to help them out. Comedy and bloodshed, murder and mayhem ensue.

Curiously this is similar to the film ""Dogma"" with Ben Affleck and Matt Damon which came out the same year (1999). Frankly ""Dogma"" was a funnier and more watchable movie.

All in all I found ""Boondock Saints"" okay, but that was about it. Given the choice, I'd watch ""Dogma"" instead.",1485561600,,925,4.634146341463414

The other day I was home from work on a sick day, unable to use my voice much so I decided to watch, especially after my best friend's insistence that I do so. I'm glad I did. It is a crazy but plausible plot line, as incredulous as it may seem to the viewer! Willem Dafoe was true to form as the quirky cop!

1427035,5,B00005IC54,"This is a cult classic, one of my favorites, along with ""BS 2-All Saints' Day"".  A huge hit by almost all word of mouth.  It is campy, funny, serious, a bit bloody and touches on a nerve in almost everyone who believes in justice.  I had this DVD and BS 2 in my collection. BS and one of the BS 2 DVDs went ""missing""...I say this mostly because I liked them enough to own them, and also because I want to inform all that there are TWO versions (that I am personally aware of) of ""Boondock Saints II - All Saints' Day"" DVDs in identical professional packaging circulating out there.  One seems to be the full length version; the other has deleted scenes that seem crucial to the film; at least to my entertainment value, if not the actual plot.  While this is not a high-end super slick, ""glossy"" Hollywood effort, it is by far more entertaining and some would say meaningful, film than many of those high end types.

Willlem Dafoe's character is beyond odd, and kept seeming to morph between brilliant and holy moly odd.

Not what I would call a family film but something I would recommend to anyone who wants to be entertained for a couple of hours. I know that it is a far fetched plot but who hasn't watched the news or witnessed a particular situation and wished that they could just eradicate the world of evil people. The overall message of good triumphing over evil is driven home throughout the film and the end leaves you wanting more of the saints. Forget the bad reviews and judge for yourself.
As a bonus to understand the plots inception, research the director and his reason for writing the story in the first place.  Put yourself in the brothers situation and think would you just roll over or would you fight back.",1483315200,5,791,4.380952380952381

Before watching the movie, I had seen a few four-star reviews, and I like Willam Dafoe and Norman Reedus, so I gave the movie a try. I watched almost an hour of it, but I couldn't take any more. I wanted to like it, but I kept getting thrown out of the story by people saying and doing ridiculous things that would never be said or done in real life. And I have no problem with fantasy. I loved ""John Wick,"" ""Wanted,"" and ""Dredd"", but those were obviously fantasies, where people behaved like these fictitious human characters might really behave within the fantasy worlds they inhabited. Boondock Saints is set in the real world, but it's unreal on many levels--in a bad way. There was also a lot of bad acting, although that can be partially blamed on the crappy script.",1481846400,,834,4.493421052631579

The violence often took a comic book form such as the scene when the Irish avengers face a hail of gunfire where hundreds or thousands of shots are fired directly at them and they emerge unscathed!

1428420,4,B00005IC54,"I'd heard of ""Boondock Saints"" for years, but this is my first time seeing it. When two Irish brothers working in a meat-packing plant get into a bar fight, they end up killing two mob enforcers. Since it was self-defense, the cops let them go, but the brothers decide to pursue a new career as vigilantes. With the help of their bumbling mob buddy, the brothers set out to kill criminals as a mission from God.

I always thought from the poster this was a John Woo-type action movie about two Matrix-type super-assassins. The movie is actually the exact opposite. The two brothers don't have great skills in martial arts or marksmanship. They try stuff they've seen in movies, which often ends in disaster. What they do have is a fearless and brutal determination that makes them forces of nature. For example, one brother is handcuffed to a toilet. If this was any other movie, he would have picked the lock on the handcuffs or dislocated his wrists to escape. Instead, he rips the toilet out of the floor, drops the toilet on the head of one mobster and jumps five stories onto the second.

There's more comedy than action with everyone from the mob to the police coming across as mostly incompetent. The one exception is Willem Dafoe as a Sherlock Holmes-type FBI agent who listens to opera and unravels the brothers' crimes just by looking at the final result. Most of the action sequences occur in flashbacks, starting with Defoe looking over the devastation the brothers caused, and figured out what happened. Dafoe should have been a bold step as a gay FBI agent. Instead, he's an embarrassing stereotype who cross-dresses, calls other people gay slurs, and flutters his hands.

But overall, it's a great movie about the role of vigilantism, crime, and police enforcement. In the final credits, the news interviews people debating the morality and value of the ""Saints"" (as the brothers are called) which does a good job of unpacking the implications of what they're doing. More than that, it's a great action movie.",1480982400,,2024,4.793696275071634

This movie is a cult classic... When I first saw it alone by chance on Saint Patrick's Day, back in 2002-3? I had just locked myself out of my truck and from being able to go join everyone at the bar. Supper bummed but feeling like it was a sign as I returned inside with the Guinness tall cans and pulled this one of the shelf. It had been looking at me for months from my roommates sic collection of DVD's. He was an actor and an artist and had amazing taste but said this was only ""OKAY"" when I had asked about it some many months earlier. I wasn't even aware it was Irish i style as I brought it out. To my surprise this was the perfect movie to watch for the first time on Saint Patrick's Day. I felt blessed and was sure it was a Coen Brothers Production. only they could be responsible for an epic of this proportion. much to my surprise it wasn't my roommate explained as he walked in 5 mn after it ended coming back to look for me.

The Boondock Saints is THE cult classic. If you haven't heard of it, it can't really be explained. Watch the first one and you'll see why for yourself. If you don't enjoy it, then there's just something wrong with you. If you believe in justice, I mean true justice and not this mamby pamby garbage the courts hand down with a slap on the wrist and a lawyer getting someone off only to have scum back out on the street, then you may enjoy these movies.

I chose the film primarily because I really enjoy Willem Dafoe, but his character in this was way over the top.

1428798,1,B00005IC54,"Apparently this movie has 'cult status', and enough fans to inspire a sequel.
I have no idea why either of these things is true. I'm willing to cut some slack for lower-budget films, but this one takes all the rope and hangs itself.

The continuous violence isn't shocking. It's often silly (but not funny), very repetitive, and eventually just *boring*. Perhaps that's because it's often clumsily shot. The slow-motion attempts to distract from that, but unsuccessfully.
The repetitive, unbelievable violence may be an attempt to distract from multiple plot holes and unbelievable coincidences. It doesn't work.
There's so little character development, the two brothers are mostly indistinguishable from each other. The two lead actors do what they can, I guess. Dafoe is a presence, but he's asked to go so far over the top, and so many jokes fall flat, that I didn't care about a single person in the film. (Least of all ""Rocco"".)  Consequently, there's never any tension of the sort Tarantino develops. Quentin T was an obvious an influence on the screenplay, but it lacks his wit and originality. The jokes fall flat. The film occasionally attempts to inject some moral/ethical introspection, but its cartoonish 2-dimensional characters--especially the victims--don't offer any grounding for that.

Throughout the second half of the film, I kept checking to see how much time was left, hoping the end would come. When it finally does, there's no foundation to build on, either emotionally or plot-wise, so the director just throws us more of the same, and then slaps on a TV news roundup that's supposed to be thought-provoking. It's not.

To make it more painful and discrete, why wouldn't the mobster kill Murphy in front of Conner in the apartment?",1479168000,2,420,4.467532467532467

Norman Reedus who went on to The Walking Dead  and  Sean Patrick Flanery will make you laugh as they manages to be kind of James Bond like in their vigilante justice in spite of themselves bringing down Boston bad boys along with their funny man Rocco played by David Della who just wants to part of the team. I love the first time I saw it and the realization of the story of Il Duce played by Billy Conolly. Yeah, I know I'm a girl and this is definetly not a chick flick but I have watched it multiple time and was thrilled when they came out when they came out with BS All Saints Day with Julie Benz bringing a woman into the mix, Judd Nelso, Peter Fonda the second movie brings out all the details of the story of past history in Ireland.

1429075,2,B00005IC54,"This film is Indie Worthy, but no Sundance nominee if you ask me. The two main characters roles on this film didn't require any great acting skills, seeing that there characters are two Irish brothers who like to drink, fight , & murder , and nothing else. William Dafoe's character role is of a very weird eccentric gay FBI Agent. I found Dafoe's character very out of place and even awkward in some scenes,  poorly written script  for Dafoe's characterv didn't leave him with many options to try  & save this role , cause we all know Dafoe is a legend on the big screen.",1478390400,,572,4.428571428571429

1429082,4,B00005IC54,It's a quirky action film that stars a young Norman Reedus as one of two Irish brothers who've made their life's work getting rid of the criminals in their neighborhood.

Every single actor in this film NAILS IT.  Willem Defoe, a personal favorite of mine, creates an edgy, smart and hilarious character in his cross-dressing detective.  (You really do have to see it).  The ""Saints""  are the kind of good Irish lads you'd want knocking off bad guys in your neighborhood.  And then there's their sidekick, and the Priest, and the Russian mob guys.

1429199,3,B00005IC54,"This is an odd film that's sort of good and sort of bad. The good comes in the form of Willem Dafoe's performance as an eccentric FBI crime scene investigator. The bad comes in the form of strange editing, where there are these fade-outs between scenes, rather than straight cuts. Also, we're supposed to cheer a couple of amateur killers because they happen to waste some gangsters? The ending felt like the film just wanted to wrap up the story somehow and make us cheer these guys as they terrorize a courtroom while spouting noble justifications. I was amused at times by the brothers' antics, but they didn't hold much rooting interest for me.",1478044800,,648,4.692982456140351

It is the flaws that make a cult classic.  The story is perfect. The actors are perfect. The directing ... eh...not so much. There are a few scenes that grate on me like nails on a chalkboard: accents slip; Dafoe does theater instead of movie. Sometimes it seems like important scenes were cut. Better directing and editing could have made this one of the greatest movies of all time. However, if that had happened, this wouldn't be a cult classic and Norman Reedus might never have ended up on AMC.
Six stars for being the perfect story, minus two for lousy directing and cutting out why everyone that knew them considered them to be saintly.",1477958400,2,714,4.492307692307692

Dafoe plays one of his most outlandish, and hilarious characters, at least, that I've ever seen. The ""cuddle"" scene is worth rewatching, just to repeatedly hear Dafoe keep saying his droll response. There are better action movies, better gangster movies, better screenplays, better, well, just about everything. You won't find many movies that mix together so many elements, so amusingly, as B.Saints does. Not perfect, but about as good as a B-movie gets.",1477699200,,550,5.63855421686747

  The  story is good, the build up is great. I will tell you its a bloody mess and not for those that follow the straight and narrow.  the language is pretty rough to say it mildly. If you grew up Irish Catholic you would of wanted these boys and their daddy protecting your streets, actually we could use some Saints among us now.  Billy Connelly is the secret star in this movie if you ask me.

1429907,5,B00005IC54,"Video's and books are hard to review. It's all about the viewers OPINION. Some peeps might NOT,  like this vid at all.  It's a hard core, modern day, SHOOT EVERYTHING AND EVERYBODY--type vid! Or, as Reedus' character put it so eloquently, ""AND WERE GONNA KILL EVERYBODY, THAT HAD ANYTHING TO F------G DO WITH IT!!""  Whilst, another person (like me) thinks, this vid is --without a doubt-- perhaps the most UNDERRATED, KICK A$$ VIDS OF ALL TIMES! Flanery and Reedus...what can I say? The first time, I just caught the ending. The boy's and their Da, put the Yakavetti's out of business for a long time. Eight years later, the Yakavettis are coming out from under their rock. They still had nightmares of that day. Two young scrapers and they're Da (that they had never met before in their entire lives!)  ...it was almost over before it started. Neither of them knowing who it was, the insuring gun fight was EPIC! It was WICKED EPIC!!. Suddenly, SOMEHOW, they recognised one another. They had been set up. They were sent to do away with each other.... BUT, now the boys, and their Da, were together....

I IMMEDIATELY went to find this vid. I FINALLY FOUND ONE VID! But it was Boondock Saints II!? Oh well. I went ahead and bought it. I figured I'd find the premier sooner or later. I didn't want to watch #2, before seeing the first one and I missed most of Defoe's part in the first one. I guess you can figure what happened next...i watched part two anyway...

OMG! When Defoe's DAUGHTER climbed out of that cruiser, with the sexiest spiked heels on I EVER SAW! And she was a KNOCK OUT! ...she was also  a special agent. She'd been put on the case. And she was looking for The Saint's. But, that's the sequel... Go rent this movie. Get the sequel. Just buy it. I bet I have seen these fifty times or more. It's Kinda like the movie GOODFELLOWS, AND, now that I've heard about a possible SAINTS III,??? It MIGHT (because of the newer vibe) become another GODFATHER.",1476921600,2,1967,4.523943661971831

If you have not seen this movie yet I highly recommend you consider viewing it. I own a copy on DVD. And I still was excited when I saw it on Prime and had to watch it..

1430159,1,B00005IC54,"My opinion is this is a very SICK movie.  Cigarette smoking is constant, foremost, and in nearly every scene. The excessive violence is shown twice by the end result and then in ultra flashback.  I think the actors degraded themselves at the altar of sick Hollywood art form.  The cat scene is real sicko.  They are smoking and with close up of blowing smoke in the cat's face.  Then they proceed to blow the cat to a bloody splatter on the wall by a close range .45 Cal. hand gun.  I watched to the end to see if it would fall apart with all the bullet holes.  The ending was a twisted and unexpected plateau to ease the violence and portray society acceptance.",1476662400,,662,4.333333333333333

1430183,3,B00005IC54,"When is vigilantism justified? This is the central question left dangling by the end of this movie. The means used involve an extraordinary degree of violence. It is a non-stop shoot-'em-up carnage, with Willem Dafoe  playing a semi-deranged gay police detective, aiding and abetting the process. Yes, it is satisfying to see the ""really bad guys"" get their comeuppance. But that feeling should also leave a funny taste in one's mouth. As should what President Rodrigo Duterte  is doing in the Philippines, with overwhelming community support. Boondock Saints is a disturbing movie. At the expense of seeming to indulge in cheap moralizing, I still feel that the film's lax attitude toward vigilantism should prevent one from awarding it more than 2 1/2 stars.",1476576000,,760,5.170731707317073

1430185,2,B00005IC54,"Let's say, for the sake of argument, that you are on of those who considers Quentin Tarantino to be one o f he best filmmakers in Hollywood. I don't quite agree with that, but I'm a fan in general, and I know the type. Given that premise, what you have here is still a mediocre film. Not only do we have a clear imitation of  the violence fetishism of Tarantino, but we have it without the intelligent and funny dialog that Tarantino invariably has, without the fascinating (and well acted) characters that Tarantino has, without the innovative and clever plotting, and without the brilliant scenes and camera work that characterize Tarantino (his strongest suit, IMO). Instead, we have stereotypes on parade. Irish, Italian, Russian, cop, Boston, gay, you name it. It's all a series of cartoon caricatures. NOT Tarantino. I infer this is supposed to be funny. I didn't laugh, not once. But clearly playing on stereotypes makes somebody laugh. What stands out most is what struck me as a ""ballet of violence."" I assume this titillates the Tarantino fans who failed to notice the more brilliant parts of his film making, and never got past the violence fetishism. I suppose there is some element of creativity there, a sort of crude beauty. But it comes across more like a 14 year old's violent fantasies, or where video games meet Hollywood. Not the most fertile ground out there.

Let's stop in the middle to give Boondock Saints one shout out: it probably gave us Norman Reedus as Darryl Dixon in The Walking Dead. For this, we are eternally grateful.

This was the first directorial effort by Troy Duffy, in 1999. It was on of three, the second being Boondock Saints II. There's a reason for this: he can't tell stories. There are all kinds of amateur errors in this film. And while it is great to see Willem Dafoe stealing the show, it is like stealing candy from babies. I can only imagine that Dafoe wasn't getting enough work. Now, there are a lot of yobs and bros who love this movie. Can't imagine what fires them up. But if their average IQs were transformed into degrees Fahrenheit and they could be harnessed for air conditioning, it would be as good as cold fusion. There's no accounting for taste, I suppose.",1476576000,,2222,4.67774936061381

S*** ASS!  Haha...

The solidarity between the brothers shows what real family should be...

I respected the bond and loved the unity they represented to the world...

When he rips the toilet out of the floor to save his brother I would hope to have such valor, if the need should ever arise...(not to rip a toilet out of the ground m, to those ready to criticize...  No, I take that back... I would rip the toilet out of the ground to save my brother, the adrenalin pumping through the character during the scene almost has my jumping out of my chair...

I've purchased the DVD, Blue Ray and have lent both out never to have them returned.
I had house guests over the weekend and we were on the subject of movies and the Boondock Saints came up so I scoured my movie collection to be sure I didn't have it, looked on NetFlix, Fire Stick, EVERYWHERE. I even looked at my local Target, Walmart and BestBuy to see if they had any available to purchase and nothing... I thought about buying the Blue Ray again (its THAT good that I would buy 20 copies) but no one had it and buying with my Prime account wouldn't get to me quick enough... So I rented it for 48 hours and introduced three new people the AWESOME that this movie is.
EVERYONE should watch this movie... EVERYONE... The acting is phenemonal. The casting couldn't have been done better for each and every single character and the role they play. You will fall in love with the movie like everyone else who has seen it. GUARANTEED!!!",1473206400,11,982,4.366120218579235

It's also sort of a simple mafia war.  Charles Bronson's name is thrown around jokingly because it's also an anti-hero revenge story.  But the action scenes are somehow more credible.  The impossible quest for what makes these men tick is nevertheless engaging.  There is always a perspective that is seeking the bigger picture.  It doesn't take itself seriously at all.

1431086,5,B00005IC54,"This story jumps around like you are sitting around a kitchen table late at night listening to someone tell you an epic tale; and it's perfect! It took me a few minutes to get used to the style, but it snuck up on me and I think this may end up being one of my favorite movies. The cast is perfect, the writing is awesome, directing is -like I already mentioned- a little odd but it works for a story like this especially if you're from an Irish family and know all about the tangents and time-skips that keep you on the edge of your seat.

I am going to be a good reviewer though and warn as much as I do love the story style it is definitely not a movie for everyone. It well and truly earns its rating. I recommend it for people who like a good story with their action, but not if the plot is all you are there for. Trust me give this a pass if vulgarity or religion used in the name of killing will distress you, especially if you happen to have young children interested in watching.",1462147200,,988,4.066666666666666

1431215,5,B00005IC54,"Ridiculous camp intercut with some truly inspired cinematography and staging (i.e. the hotel massacre). DeFoe's performance borders on offensive (and I still can't decide if the performance is homophobic or wildly brave), but for some reason, the two leads carry the film to the level of more than merely watchable. The film's success rests on the intertwining of vigilante justice and the smolder of a pre-Walking Dead Reedus (as well as Flannery) but for some inexplicable reason, the film works, despite the contrived stereotypes and storytelling. I simply  can't explain, as a film teacher, why I love this movie- I  just do.",1457827200,4,629,5.1568627450980395

1431521,2,B00005IC54,"Mindless style over substance, written as an homage to Pulp Fiction while missing every single element that made that movie work. Impossible to believe that FBI Agent Willem Dafoe (with that hair?) releases the two Irish twins and then spends the rest of the movie ""expertly solving"" all these executions in Boston when he should already know it was the people he himself released from the police station (after they turned themselves in). Still don't understand why their comedic partner killed the bartender, he didn't do nothin'. After the third or fourth recreation crime scene, where Willem Dafoe works up a sweat and actually shoots his handgun straight up into the air ""recreating the crime scene"", I lost interest. Have no idea where it went after that and don't care. Perhaps example of a 1999 movie that celebrates the vapidity of Hollywood with the assumption that the audience is stupid enough to love the mindlessness of it. By the way, wouldn't the FBI agent have been removed from his job after firing his handgun in the suburban neighborhood during the crime scene investigation? So unbelievably stupid that Hollywood had a bidding war over this dumb ripoff Tarantino-esque script. (Extra star for Willem Dafoe hamming it up for a movie he didn't even get paid for, they stiffed him.)",1445040000,,1300,4.967889908256881

I am not one for realistic violence.  Unfortunately the world tolerates way too much.

This film, however, calls into question accepted concepts of good versus evil.  It adds a layer of propriety on killings sanctioned by the church, as a symbol or representative of The Higher Power or Order.

Very thought provoking.  Very violent.

1431618,5,B00005IC54,"This movie is a Crime Drama, also is an indie movie. It finish filming in 1999. On January 2000, it only first run in five cinema. Therefore, it only had a little reaction. However, it became a popular movie after the DVD publish.
This movie narrated that the story about a pair of brave and devout Irish brothers. They offend the gang because of justifiable homicide. And then they decided to punish the crime. They began to become the Boondock Saints to eliminate the gangster in Boston, at the same time, FBI also have been investigating them.
I think the reason why a lot of people like this film was the aesthetics of violence and religious lynching can bring a strong sensory stimulation for us and vent our pressure. In this movie, they fired each other, battled everywhere, even a lot of blood also spatter everywhere. I am no idea about whether lynching was right, but he recited something before the execution was that making he look very cool. These elements like the violence, shooting, killing, religious, racist joke, and the 246 times ""Fxxk"" let the ordinary audience who enjoy the uneventful and bland daily life feel exciting.",1441065600,,1143,4.777777777777778
1431619,5,B00005IC54,"What an underappreciated film (by critics). In a manner that not only tells a compelling tale but knows when to do so both seriously and light-heartedly, this movie is the perfect balance of a tongue-in-cheek commentary on the genre while still being a vital addition to the very same genre it pokes fun at. What a fantastic performance by the leads Flanery and Reedus, whose on-screen chemistry made me really believe they could be brothers. Willam Dafoe was also amazing. The narrative style and editing choices of this film are beautifully done, and how the narrative style reflects the plot and implied realizations of characters is truly brilliant. What a fantastic movie. I wish I bought it instead of rented it, but I honestly wouldn't mind paying to watch it again.

The screenplay is sophomoric and the acting is so over the top that one doesn't know whether it's a bad spoof of the gangster genre. I was appalled by the lack of direction by Mr. Duffy who seemed to have just left the cameras rolling so that all the self indulgent actors could preen and work on acting exercises. I kept trying to give the film a chance until the cruel death of the cat. I am so embarrassed for all concerned.

Acting is pretty good. I liked William Dafoe and Norman Reedus the best in the movie.

It's a great guy movie.  It's exciting and at times funny as each scene with the brothers unfolds.  William Dafoe was pretty awesome in his role.  Some friends of mine wished the way the movie ended was better but I liked the movie ending the way it did because it lets you think about whether killing for certain reasons is right.",1431561600,,578,4.572815533980583

I thought at first hearing about this movie that it was going to be all action and completely boring but it was not at all like I thought. There is tons of humor -a little dry at times- and the action scenes are well put together and just amazing. This movie is a work of art. one disclosure though is that this movie is not for the easily offended. watch the 2nd one also-its even better. oh and also go watch deleted scenes on youtube,1424390400,,543,4.132075471698113

1432299,5,B00005IC54,This is a wonderful movie that deals with the half caste breed of children fathered by white slave masters who seemed not able to keep their hands off their black slaves.  Although it is a shameful subject the movie was well constructed and informative.  It is not a documentary but a full length feature movie set in New Orleans.

Boondock Saints is both an action ack-ack (shoot-m-up) drama and comedy all in one.  The brothers played by Sean Patrick Flanery as Connor and Norman Reedus (widely known for his role of Darryl in Walking Dead) as Murphy MacManus are killers hunted by a WAY over the top Detective Paul Smecker (Willem Defoe).

Willem Dafoe's character steals the show at times.  But overall, you will genuinely end up liking the movie.  Why only four stars?  I didn't really care for the way it ended.  I think it was meant to be a twist ending.  But, for me, it came across as ""I know!  Let's wrap up quickly like this....""

The reason is that the plot does not develop it just happens and we must piece it out in our minds. I do not like movies that seem to be filmed and then thrown in a pile so some editor can make it into a movie. This one does flow somewhat but not really on a 4 star flow. I will not watch it again and I will sell my video. Sorry Willem Defoe. I generally think his movies are tops but this is mediocre to me.,1397433600,,490,3.5462962962962963

Willem, Sean, Norman, and David (Smecker, Connor, Murphy, and Rocco) are absolutely perfect together and create one of the funniest movies ever with what seems like no effort.  They just click- they don't have to try hard to make the lines funny because they were cast so perfectly.

electric kaboom of a slew of interesting characters and catchy dialogue.

There is not one unnecessary character in this movie; everyone plays their part and they play it well, especially Willem Dafoe.

Is there anything negative about this movie? Yes; the Critics.

I'm not entirely sure what critics expect from movies, i really don't.
This movie is virtually panned by critics, and I don't understand why. To be fair, it's not the greatest movie of all time, but it's pretty damn good.

So, in the end;

If someone told me that this movie exists alongside The Tarantino Universe, specifically Pulp Fiction, I'd totally agree.

And for the bottom line, i'll have to say an 85%- Unique, Darkly Comedic in some areas, and Undeniably Bad-Ass,
The Boondock Saints is a bullet storm of entertainment from start to finish.",1395532800,,1017,4.810344827586207
1432643,5,B00005IC54,I really like this movie although it's very violent so it may not be for everyone. Two brothers and their misfit friend go around smiting evil doers while giving law enforcement a major headache along the way in more than one way. Willem Dafoe is great in this by the way.,1395273600,,272,4.352941176470588
1432644,4,B00005IC54,"I have to admit that I loved this movie.  It's one of those violent, unbelievable sort of vigilante movies that often border on silly, but it is so well acted and so well written that it draws you in and makes you really care about the characters.  Willem Dafoe steals the show.  I recommend it!  And I can't believe I'm saying that.  If you like action adventure Rambo-like movies, you'll love this one.",1395187200,,404,4.47945205479452

1432748,5,B00005IC54,"If you know this movie, you already either love it or hate it, I think.  Not a lot of hangers-on-the-fence on this one.  This BD contains an extended director's cut (showing the full rule of thumb bit, for one thing) as well as the theatrical release, and resolution (although remastered) is perfectly acceptable.  And the film is as relevant and funny and violent and a bit sad (still feel bad for the cat) as it was the day it was released.

I'm not a huge fan of the second one, but the original is a must-have.",1388620800,,514,4.322916666666667

1432751,5,B00005IC54,"A friend turned me on to this odd, funny, engaging little crime drama. Really good cast, kind of a vaguely Pulp Fiction feeling to it. The cast is really great with nice production values.  If I had any complaint the main protagonists have very heavy Irish accents which made some of the very good dialogue a bit hard to understand. My wife who is Irish had no problem. This is pretty violent (but not I feel over the top and the violence does serve the story). As mentioned I had never heard of this but if you like things like Pulp Fiction you'll undoubtably like this. Destined to become, if it isn't already a cult classic. Excellent cast, good story, movie never drags but ploughs along at a very satisfying pace.",1388448000,,718,4.480916030534351

1432845,4,B00005IC54,"Occasionally too far over the top... Occasionally stretches your suspension of disbelief to the limit, but it is certainly a cathartic romp into some very dark places.  Typically flawed hollywood gunplay, but that's the norm rather than the exception.  Willem Dafoe's character is a treat for most of the movie even if he gets a little too unbelievable at the end.  This movie will definitely appeal to a young adult audience.",1385769600,,426,4.971830985915493

A cult hit that captivated a generation with such force not liking this movie will earn you looks of disgust.  The same movie we all love so much in Blu-ray clarity.

1432901,5,B00005IC54,"This had to be one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.  It's raw, and a little awkward in places, but that just adds to one's enjoyment of the general mayhem.  Also, to see Willem Defoe in drag...well, I'll let you glim that for yourselves...I thought it was a riot!

Fraternal twin brothers, intense Irish Catholics, take it upon themselves to rid The Hub of it's criminals and miscreants.  Along the way they collect followers, kill people, are questioned by the police, and ultimately run up against the Boston Italian Mob - who sends their most infallible mad-dog killer to kill these two modern crusaders against evil...

The gun interplay is told in flashback's as Defoe's character, a gay FBI Profiler, listens to loud opera on his earphones and walks his way through the scene...then we see the twins in action...and flash back.  It's a charming style for a move that is both un-repentantly violent and hysterically funny.

To prove the point, I've seen Roadhouse probably 20 times, and I can watch it another 20 times, too. So, i'm def not a movie snob.

I only give one star as it gives me insight into what the next gen thinks...... Everyone can rationalize oppression, but how many can look past it all and create beyond the paradigm? Everyone wants to take... very few want to give. Be careful what messages these films give. There is no artistic worth in this film. Just film boxes and pointless death, murder.... I am disgusted with this filth. I worry that those that voted this so high have no essence of humanity, or art in mind..... The world is changing.

1433347,2,B00005IC54,"To be totally honest I both loved and hated this film at the same time. If such a senario could even be possible it shouldn't be any suprise to those who have seen this film for me to say something like that. At first I pretty much couldn't stand this film, but numerous aspects about it won me over.... sort of. Firstly the acting by the entire cast was absolutely brilliant. Willem Dafoe was so good in this he pretty much deserved an Oscar for his performance. He's that good as the quirky FBI agent who's gay but hates homosexuals. I also loved the originality of this film. What I didn't like so much was the annoying metal style music soundtrack. I couldn't stand that, and I pretty much didn't care for some of the characters who were extremely animated. Somehow I pretty much hated the way the characters were so over the top, and it annoyed me. I agree that this film isn't for everyone. It's part black comedy, part vigilante fantasy with a lot of yelling and cussing that sometimes was so extreme it gave me a first class headache. But you have give credit where credit is due. Where else but a wierd movie like this would you find Willen Dafoe, Ron Jeremy, and the guy that played Morris O'Brian from the series 24(as a mob boss no less) in the same film? This was a very weird film but also impossible to ignore for it's unique blend of stylized violence, zaney homocidal maniacs who are considered heroes, and just a lot of very unusual stuff you are not going to see again in any other movie.",1367884800,,1507,4.385714285714286

This is a rare case of almost not wanting to watch the movie to completion as I wanted to see if I was missing something that others saw.  The 2 actors who played the Irish brothers had a nearly unintelligble dialogue (and this is coming from someone who has NUMEROUS Irish relatives and is not a stranger to the Irish brogue).  I'm not going to knock those who liked this movie, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone I know.

1433461,5,B00005IC54,"This is an extremely violent comedy about 2 Irish-American brothers living in South Boston.  They, along with their Italian best friend Rocco, start killing criminals.  Meanwhile Agent Smecker who is a homo-phobic homo-sexual FBI agent is tracking them.  Papa Joe Yakavetta gets an assassin released.  Agent Smecker decides to help the brothers because they only kill bad guys.  Rocco gets killed.  The assassin that Papa Joe hired realizes after hearing the brothers recite a family prayer over Rocco that the brothers are his twin sons.  So the brothers' father joins them and with Agent Smecker and 3 Boston police officers help the brothers and their father kill Papa Joe at his trial in front of everyone.  They end up being deemed the Saints of South Boston by the press and public.
This is an extremely violent film that is just as funny as it is violent.  I would recommend it to anyone who loves to see bad guys get their comeuppence!  It is not suitable for very young children!  But, it is one of my top 10 favorite films!  The only people that I wouldn't recommend this film to are people who don't like violent films with a lot of cursing and a little minor and non-sexual nudity in them.",1365638400,,1201,4.666666666666667

It's great how they show you what happened as they are solving the crime. Dafoe is his usual passionate self and really adds to the comedy in the movie. It's not a movie for kids of people that don't like blood.  For it not being a high dollar picture the quality of the movie is fantastic.

1433570,3,B00005IC54,"Critics panned this movie, and I'm not really sure why.  They seem to agree that it's more interested in gory images than in depth or insight, and some feel it's a Tarantino ripoff (as he's the king of shallow, gratuitous violence).  I didn't get that.  I'll admit the tone is uneven--cauterizing one's wounds is almost unendurable agony, but lighting a man on fire is funny?-- and though nobody likes endless exposition this might be a rare case of too much show, not enough tell.  If my brother and I received a sign that we should go shoot bad guys, I think we'd discuss it a bit.  As it is, we have little to no sense of the characters' real thoughts about what they do.

 That said, I don't think that TBS is ""so gleeful in its endorsement of vigilante justice"" that it's almost to self-parody, as a reviewer for the AV Club opined.  I'm not saying this film handles the issue as maturely as, say, The Dark Knight does; however, the interviews at the end are clearly meant to provoke some sort of discussion.  I think the film makes a decent point when the brothers describe a typical person's ""just shoot `em all"" reaction to seeing criminals get away.  Is that really what most people want to see happen?  Toby Keith has a song called ""Beer for my Horses"" on exactly that topic.  I call it the lynch mob song and it was one of his biggest hits.  Lots of critics like Dexter and it's about a man who kills those whom the law doesn't get.  I just feel like I don't get where the line is drawn.

 Regardless of moral questions, TBS is bound to be successful with some because it utilizes a winning formula: brothers who fight crime and say prayers before they kill.  Unless it's grossly mishandled, what isn't cool about that?  Paul Smecker is an unusual case of a character being gay for no obvious reason, and as far as I can tell convinced a majority of the male audience that gay can be bad*ss.  So that's nice. Though I enjoy watching the interaction between the characters, I can't for the life of me figure out why the brothers are so attached to Rocco,and having Il Duce turn out to be their father seems kind of dumb and out of nowhere.  Still, it's an overall decent film that I think greatly appeals to the wanna-be superhero in a lot of men.  7/10",1362268800,,2263,4.391826923076923

So the concept of the movie I liked, justice being served, fighting bad guys etc. But I just feel their script writer had virtually no imagination and filled those area's when he could have built up dialog by just having them repeat the F word over and over. So just be warned, this might not be idea for a family movie night.

The gun fight scenes are crazy, the drop down through the ceiling is an absolute blast, the seafood warehouse joke that Murphy plays on Connor and then Connor's revenge on Murphy.  I laugh every time even before the scene starts.

Then the alley scene.  What can I say?  It has to be the most fun part of the entire movie.  Connor flying off the fire escape, Murphy's duck and cover when the toilet is coming down, a gorgeous Norm Reedus running around while an excellent score is playing, an equally gorgeous Sean Flanery out cold on the ground.  Worth a rewind and rewatch. ;)

The air-duct scene - hilarious!

The gun ""store"" scene, an absolute blast.  Murphy's reaction to that big gun on the wall (I don't know what it is but my son does), Connor's dismissive look when Murphy points the even bigger gun at him, the little ""smart-alecky"" twist of Murphy's lips when Conner gets the rope.

The guys are drop-dead gorgeous.  Their relationship is wonderful (both the actors and their characters).  I love that the actors are my age (Sean Patrick Flanery a year or so younger, Norman Reedus a few more years younger) even though they play characters several years younger.

It really is a fun movie.  Go ahead and give it a shot.  I didn't expect to like it but my son insisted that I watch it and I'm so glad he did.  We often have Boondock Saints marathons (he's 19 with Autism and these are a couple of his most favorite movies, especially I).

We have much of the merchandise from their store and the guy who runs their store is a very nice, friendly guy.  I won't mention the store URL because of promotion guidelines here but if you love the movie(s) then you'll love the store. :)",1357948800,,1715,4.456591639871383

1433838,2,B00005IC54,"The directing and acting are both enjoyable, and I agree with other reviewers who say that, despite being a movie about vigilantism there are quite a few funny and tongue-in-cheek character moments.  Having said that, while the style of the movie is attractive, there's not much substance behind it.  I see a storyline that subordinates itself to the characters from the outset, and because of a lack of character development, a principal tenet of the story- the morality of vigilantism- becomes an unanswered cliche.  (As an example, compare this movie with Dirty Harry in ""Magnum Force,"" a less stylized but more substantive movie.)

As an aside, while watching this movie I was reminded of ""The Town,"" because of the Boston/Irish connections, and this was interesting.

In short, knowing what I know now, I might rent this movie once for fun, but I wouldn't buy it because I don't think I'll watch it again.",1356480000,2,910,4.921568627450981

Two brothers, I gather in exile from Ireland, hold mundane jobs,while wreaking havoc on various crime figures.  In comes FBI agent (Willem Dafoe) who, along with the Precinct's police, admire these brothers for fighting crime.  After a while Dafoe seems to be in leagues with the ""Saints"".  The ending, which I won't divulge, was a surprise.  Of course, Hollywood has its usual gratuitous sex, that being Dafoe's penchant for men.  This portrayal was totally unnecessary, and it did mar the movie.  As for the language, that, too, was unnecessary. However, the brothers made this movie very enjoyable.  Lots of action scenes, killings, and their credo ""no women, no children"" did help.  At least they were killing scum.  The no women, no children did bring me back to ""The Professional""; that was Leon's philosophy.  Wonder if there is a connection here.",1348012800,,1001,4.963855421686747

Ok, here's Albert Einstein on Boondock Saints. All human desires and actions can be boiled down to a quest to experience greater happiness, and to avoid suffering. Some of us look for happiness in the wrong places, of course. And BS shows us this, but isn't honest about the consequences. Kill and get away with it and be delighted. This is science fiction.

All religions tell us that expansive feelings, thoughts, and actions increase our happiness (read: love, kindness, empathy, forgiveness, awareness of others' realities, etc.). Contractive actions (murder, revenge, anger, and so on) decrease our happiness by narrowing our awareness upon ourselves.

And, well, no wonder teenage boys love BS. They haven't developed the part of their brains that is capable of understanding the long-term consequences of actions driven by negative emotions, i.e., the prefrontal cortex which doesn't fully develop until the mid-20s or later. Nor are they taught in our schools to expand their hearts to include others.

So, it's no surprise that BS would be praised by 17-year-olds in a state of, let's hope, temporary sociopathy. Or that movie-makers with infantile values and taste would agree.",1339718400,6,1387,5.20627802690583

1434099,4,B00005IC54,"The Boondock Saints is one of those movies for me that I've wanted to see for years but for some reason never got around to actually doing so. But after seeing this in store, I just had to pick it up and finally see it.

The movie was pretty good. It's definitely a movie I would say fits the ""Rated M For Manly"" name, which is more or less the opposite of the term ""chick flick"". The movie isn't particularly plot heavy. All in all, it's just a movie about two brothers who, after hearing the true story of Kitty Genovese and protecting themselves and a friend in a double self-defense killing, are inspired and believe they need to fight back against hard criminals, especially organized crime types.

That pretty much is the entire plot of the movie. There's no ""I want to kill the monster who murdered and raped my mother"" or ""My girlfriend has been kidnapped!"" or anything like that. Just two brothers who get tired of evil and set out to fight back. Not that i'm say this is a bad thing. Fortunately the movie is pretty enjoyable so you almost forget that it's not exactly heavy on actual plot. I'd take this over some plot-heavy movies any day.

It's kind of interesting the way the narrative of the movie is told. The way the movie begins to work is that there's Scene A where the brothers are deciding to go after someone, then suddenly we see the police at the crime scene, and then FBI Agent Paul Smecker (played brilliantly by Willem Dafoe) recounts how it went down to amazingly perfect detail but we actually see what happens in flashback.

The acting in the movie was great from all the main stars. I thought Willem Dafoe did great as Agent Smecker and is probably the strangest and most over-the-top fictional FBI agent I ever seen. Considering this was Troy Duffy's very first movie's he's ever written and/or directed, I thought he did a good job as well.",1336348800,,1873,4.483870967741935

My final paper for my philosophy class is to argue whether I think the MacManus brothers were right to act as they did, and I really am having a difficult time with it.  I believe that it is never right to kill, but even so, I'm finding it difficult to condemn them.  Really an excellent movie, I didn't expect it to be so good.",1335398400,,425,4.222222222222222
1434101,4,B00005IC54,"The Boondock Saints is certainly gory and profane- expect graphic deaths and screaming, expletive-laden tirades- but underlying this gritty appearance is a meaningful exploration of morality. Like Crime and Punishment, the movie focuses on the righteousness of going above the law to eradicate evil, examining if the ends justify the means. Without giving anything away, the excellent twist at the end provides a fitting, Wild West like ending that effectively answers this question with an exclamation point. The action scenes are well done (though bloody), and the change of heart of Dafoe's character is also well done. If you are looking for a movie that adds some thoughtfulness to the violence, this movie is for you,though personally I felt that it was a bit excessive at times. Saints is not a happy movie that will leave you feeling uplifted at the end; rather, it is a ""thinker"" movie that makes you think about what you would do in the position of the ""saints"".",1334534400,,972,4.969325153374233
1434102,1,B00005IC54,"So Pulp Fiction happened, and then Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels happened, and then every action movie under the sun had to be (and couldn't ever be) as cool as them. Boondock Saints (conveniently abbreviates to 'BS') is one of those movies. It's like the fat girl who tries to squeeze into a tutu because all her friends have them - it's tragic, unintentionally comical and just plain ugly.

This may actually be the worst movie I've ever seen. I calculate it thus for the following:

A). It's high-budget enough to have Willem Defoe and Billy Connolly in it, yet it still sucks.

B). It may have the highest percentage of slo-mo of any movie ever. In fact, most of the movie seems to take place in a montage.

C). The plot is about as unfortunate as a fart in a space suit.

I'll elaborate on point C. This script must have been written by middle-school kids. It's hormonally indulgent to the point of nausea. It plays out like a breadcrumb trail of unfortunate scenes, none of which should have ever been committed to film.

The synopsis is appalling: a pair of Irish Catholic twins kills some Russian mobsters in a bar brawl. They then come to the epiphany that killing mobsters is their God-given task on earth and enter a life of vigilantism. They happen to have been taught Russian by their mother. Their father turns out to be a strange mob psychopath played by - truly an act of comedy - Billy Connolly. In a Skywalker-esque plot twist at the end, the three team up to execute a mobster as he pleads innocent in the courtroom.

In one scene towards the beginning of BS, a big angry lesbian ends up training at the meat-packing plant where the two brothers work. A bunch of appalling stereotypes play out and end with one brother and the lesbian duking it out. I can't begin to imagine what possessed anybody to write, act, film or direct this scene. In another, a particularly gluttonous indoor smoke-fest ends in the cat being shot by accident. The shootout with Billy Connolly may be the dumbest shooting scene of all time - one of the mob's most legendarily lethal (and Scottish) assassins shows up on the doorstep in plain daylight waving a red flag. The three guys then stand at almost point-blank range and unload about a legion's worth of ammunition at each other, doing exactly zero damage to each other, for no reason.

The amount of poor material in this film is astounding, and I won't belabor the point. This film is a disgrace to action films, vigilantism, Billy Connolly and Willem Defoe, good taste, good reason and even to pastiche and satire, which it doesn't manage to execute properly either.

In conclusion, do not rent, buy or watch this movie. You won't enjoy it, even if derision is your only motive.",1334102400,11,2738,4.594262295081967
1434103,3,B00005IC54,"I find it interesting that so many parallels are drawn between this and Pulp Fiction, because beyond the genre staples and one or two racy taboo-challenging scenes, they don't have all that much in common. The Saints don't benefit from the comparison, either, considering Fiction is an ambitious, label-defying, scene chewing mega-monster, while they're just suitably entertaining bullet spitters with an accent. There's plenty of good action to be savored here, with a few wildly original payoffs and an upturned barrel full of blood'n'guts, but at heart it's an extremely simple vigilante justice story that's well-served by its hair trigger. The two leads, twin brothers who seem to have been waiting their entire lives for the excuse to go on this kind of a rampage, power through wave after wave of mafia underlings without even a whiff of danger until the closing moments. That makes for some giddy action sets early on, sure, but when the story is finally ready to slow down and say something, it's left without anything to lean on. Willem DaFoe is a potential show-stealer as the morally (and sexually) confused police detective on the Saints' case, but he falls victim to the same trappings as the plot. Loaded with character, bravado and personality, it lacks depth and meaning.",1334016000,,1288,5.051643192488263

""The Boondock Saints"" is a vigilante-type movie about Boston that takes place in Southie, and unless you are part of the targeted demographic, you won't find this film to be very interesting.

Willem DaFoe portrays a Godlike bitch who knows everything and drives everyone around him in the Boston Police Department nuts.  I guess that's supposed to be funny.  The two Irish kids who decide to take on organized crime in Boston are so seemingly invulnerable, they may as well have superhuman powers. I guess they were supposed to be dudes who were not to be screwed with, but they came across as just plain weird.

1434145,5,B00005IC54,"Pure genius.  A Masterpiece of writing, directing, acting, editing, and, of course, cinematography.  Imagine how difficult it would be to make a movie that shows 20 or so bad guys being blown-away and it's all FUNNY!  How can anyone even think of pulling that off. But Writer/Director Troy Duffy did it all.  Absolutely amazing and I can't stop smiling.  I know there are some personalities that can't enjoy a film like this, but genius is genius, and this is nothing short of an astonishing accomplishment from start to finish.  I love the characters, the acting, the bonding, the loyalty, love, humor and the new presentation of showing the crime scene before you see the crime.

1434151,3,B00005IC54,"The Boondock Saints, an odd and surprisingly funny crime thriller by director Troy Duffy, is the tale of two brothers embarking on a simple quest to rid the streets of Boston of evil.

The 1999 film starts off like any other, opening with a brief scene of Connor McManus (Sean Patrick Flanery) and Murphy McManus (Norman Reedus) at church followed by a playful display of brotherly affection at a slaughter house, leading one to believe that the two could pass as a pair of well-meaning saintly twins.  An image quickly dispelled when Russian mobsters strong arm the owner of their favorite pub to close.  Setting the pace for the rest of movie, the film cuts to Special Agent Paul Smecker (Willem Dafoe), who pieces together the rather interesting crime scene left behind by Connor and Murphy, with a bit of seemingly wacky deductive reasoning.

Gaining inspiration from the heavens, or their own violent psyches, the brothers cut a bloody and often times amusing swath through the Russian and Italian mafia.  Growing more and more eccentric with each new crime scene, Smecker pieces together the story of the brothers, adding much of the humor to the film.
While not particularly striking on any deeper level, as with Reservoir Dogs and a personal favorite of mine, Rockn' Rolla, The Boondock Saints nevertheless manages to hit the nail on the head in the field of check-in-your-brain crime movies by mixing well-choreographed action with humor.  The ploy of following Dafoe as he pieces together what's happening is useful in breaking up the action scenes and allows for more of the films humor to seep through from his brilliantly preformed reenactments of the crimes.

While not the most Oscar worthy performances in cinema, Flanery and McManus performed well together and really succeeded in bringing an air of brotherly love to the characters.  The score by Jeff Danna helped ground the film during some of the more zany moments.  Although the ending fell a little flat and blas, at least for my tastes, the cult classic nevertheless managed to hold my attention and keep me interested as it took me from point A to point B.  All in all, I would give this film three out of five stars and would recommend it to anyone in the mood for a dark, but oddly lighthearted, action flick.",1318118400,3,2286,4.838461538461538

The audio is better, especially in the action scenes. It's not anything that will tax your entertainment system, but it will entertain. It is an improvement over the DVD, but I wouldn't waste my money if I already owned it on DVD.

1434211,1,B00005IC54,"The Boondock Saints has become something of a legend that critiques can't really touch. If someone says that they don't like it, that person quickly becomes accused of ""not getting it"" or is bombarded with a list of reasons that the movie is great. Despite this, I'm going to try to convince you why you should not see this movie, or, if you've seen it, why it isn't as good as you think it is.
The Boondock Saints centers around two Irish brothers, Connor and Murphy MacManus, who have a favorite pub that closes on St. Patrick's Day due to the actions of a local Russian mafia. The brothers attempt to reason with the mobsters (great idea, I know), but then have to beat them up instead. This leads them to decide to go on a killing spree of professional criminals throughout Boston.
The actions of the brothers are tracked by a needlessly gay and apparently clairvoyant FBI agent named Paul Smecker, who has the amazing ability to re-create their killing sprees verbatim after a cursory glance of their crime scenes. Smecker is played by Willam Dafoe, that invaluable actor who can usually do no wrong, and his performance is the one good thing in The Boondock Saints. I specifically mention the performance as apart from the character, which is completely implausible even in a silly violencefest like this one. His monologues are well-performed but cannot be taken seriously as any kind of police work.
But he isn't the star of this movie, the brothers are. I want you to go back and read my second paragraph, pausing to count the number of Irish stereotypes. The actors playing the brothers, Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus, may be fine elsewhere, I don't know, but they are given nothing to do here. Neither of them have a single line of dialogue that distinguishes them from one another. There is not a shred of a reason to have them split into two characters, and even less of a reason to center a movie around them at all. Neither of them has anything interesting to say, and they can't even be bothered to say it in an interesting way.
But the directing, oh the directing. The action scenes of The Boondock Saints are incomprehensible messes. It is impossible to tell where any of the players are, or who they are, or why they're doing what they are doing. This, of course, refers to when the movie actually bothers to show the action- most of the action scenes are shown in retrospect, with Smecker narrating what happened. The movie's major failure in these cases is to not make us care about whom the ""saints"" are killing. It simply takes their word for it that these people are evil and deserve to die. None of these supposed villains are given more screen time than is absolutely necessary, and many of them aren't even shown doing anything particularly villainous. I don't demand that a movie sacrifice subtlety in order to establish its villains as evil, but is it too much to ask for more than mere labels of ""good"" and ""bad?""
To make matters worse, Boondock Saints seems aware of the fact that it doesn't establish its heroes as sympathetic or its villains as evil. Over the end credits, there's a tacked-on ""man on the street"" news report, asking people what they think of the brothers. Some find them sympathetic, some find them reprehensible. I was ready to write the movie off as a dumb action movie (which it certainly is), but this sequence borders on the grotesque. The movie is a hymn of exaltation to brutal violence, and suddenly it has the gall to step back and point the finger at the viewer for enjoying it? The credits sequence demonstrates the movie's desire to have its violent cake and eat it, too. Troy Duffy didn't have the guts to simply direct a dumb action movie; he wanted to try to tack on social commentary by means of a 5-minute credit sequence. It's this sequence, all by itself, which takes the movie from bad to awful for me.
Fans of the movie bring up this sequence to demonstrate The Boondock Saints' supposed depth. The thing none of them seem to realize is that this sequence isn't earned. What's come before is a movie that glorifies grisly vigilante violence via its camerawork, editing, and script. Gentlemen, you can't have it both ways.
I've heard many compare the movie with Quentin Tarantino's work in films like Pulp Fiction, but Tarantino has a real ear for dialogue and character. The ""royale with cheese"" conversation alone has more wit and depth than any scene of The Boondock Saints, and the violence in Pulp Fiction is called for by the story and the demands of scene. The Boondock Saints' violence is all for its own sake; it doesn't build to anything, it doesn't add up.
None of this even touches the movie's other problems; an unfunny character named Rocco supposedly brought in for comic relief, Ron Jeremy's inexplicable cameo, the complete waste of casting the great Billy Connolly as the brothers' father when he's barely allowed to talk... I could go on. I don't know what else to say. I've been dropped into an online community that worships a bad movie. I have no explanation for it. But to end, here's a list of movies of similar material to see instead.

-Snatch
-Pulp Fiction, or any Tarantino movie
-Goodfellas, or any Scorsese movie
-Fight Club
-Scarface
-In Bruges
-Batman Begins
-Overnight, the fascinating documentary about the making of The Boondock Saints

1434249,5,B00005IC54,"Beginning with two young Irish men, devout Catholics both, who stand up for their rights against foreign gangsters in the streets of Boston, they quickly gain fame for standing up for the little guy against the crime and degradation taking root in the city. Believing themselves to be on a mission from God, they choose to move against other organized crime and make a difference for the innocent people in the world. As the two Irishmen, Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus are excellent. Their erstwhile Italian ally, for some reason portraying a character with his own name, is David Della Rocco, much more amateurish in his efforts but trying to follow their example as best he can. Perhaps his disinterest in their Catholic roots dooms him, as his solo efforts clearly lack the panache of their giving last rites to their victims. They are, after all, the Boondock Saints.

Opposing them is the semi-closetbound gay FBI agent played by Willem Dafoe. His ability to recreate the scene and circumstances of the boys' actions in taking down criminals otherwise above the law is something to behold. Something of a savant, he listens to opera on headphones while examining crime scenes, his mood darkening as the killings continue and he is unable to determine the culprits. For that matter, he is not certain he wants to arrest them, since they are cleaning up the streets better than the legitimate law ever could.

The second disc has the special features. There are a half-dozen or so deleted scenes, some of which are actually just extended versions of scenes that appear in the film on disc 1. There are, however, a couple of the deleted scenes that perhaps should have been added in for this unrated edition, if only to clarify as the movie progresses some of the origins of the Saints.

Oddly, there are two commentaries, one by the writer/director, the other by Billy Connolly, who has about ten lines and does not even appear until near the end of the movie. Commentaries by Reedus and Flanery would have been preferable. However, that does not take away from the quality of this edition of the movie.

If you don't like the ""F"" word, steer clear, as it's used as a noun,verb, adjective, etc.
Also there is, for me, a sickening scene involving Willem DeFoe kissing another man that could have been left out. I guess for shock value it was put in, but it's QUITE graphic and tongue filled. The second time I watched the movie I just looked away, it's that unsettling.

The movie is actually quite slapstick, but I loved the ""preaching"" that went on in the court house (at gunpoint), in the end. It's quite a shoot 'em up with lots of gags and the co-star ""Roc"" gives quite a few laughs. The main characters have a childish fight scene in an air duct that was cleverly done, eventually leading to the death of scores of bad guys.

These things made me think of The Matrix movies; the unbelievably bad scenery-chewing from everyone on screen made me think of The Black Dahlia.  We have here an Unholy Trinity of Cinematic Crap.

And why does Dafoe's character listen to opera, and why is this supposed to provide some insight into his character?  Is it because gay men listen to opera?  Shouldn't he be listening to show tunes instead?  Maybe it's because Troy Duffy can't tell the difference.  Who knows.

To its credit, it achieves the baseline for any movie, which is that it makes the audience forget about their lives for a bit and become engrossed in an alternate realm. Unfortunately, it does little beyond this.

Few elements of the plot are necessary. Dafoe in drag, for instance. Not needed, and even immediately after seeing the scene I was wondering why and how it happened. This is not a good sign.

After thinking about the movie, I realized that all it had going for it was stylized violence. It had little semblance of plot, zero character development (unless an increasing kill count is a development), and worthless dialog. All in all, pret'ny worthless.

1434334,5,B00005IC54,"Irish bothers Connor and Murphy (Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus) get an epiphany after killing in self defense....God wants them to rid the world of evil. So, using guns and religion as weapons, they systematically wage a war on those in society who use and abuse those considered weak. Why not start with the mobsters who control the city and brutalize those who stand in their way.  Realizing that there is more to these deaths that meet the eye, a somewhat unconventional FBI Agent Paul Smecker (William Defoe) arrives on the scene with headphones (he listens to opera) and a dedication to catching these vigilantes, although he secretly desires to join the duo. Running from some who want to kill them, while trying to rid the world of those deemed less desirable, Connor and Murphy meet their match in a gray haired killer released to catch them. As the story unravels, there are gun fights, comedic bantering, but most of all there is a sense that these two Irish brothers are doing the very things that people desire to do themselves. Handing out justice...being the judge, the jury and the executioner appeals to most, even an FBI Agent whose hands are tied usually by the law. So while their methods may appear to be brutal, we justify the actions and find some sense of hope that there are still those that stand for what is right. They are doing what we have all longed to do and one point or another. And although we could debate is doing the wrong thing for the right reasons justify their actions (i.e., breaking the law...murder is murder), it was great just seeing two people take a stand for something that they believe in and this is what made this storyline so endearing.

This movie had everything that made it great......there is comedy, violence,  creative twists, and great acting that only a truly brilliant and creative director could bring to life. My first thought was that this movie could have been directed by Tarentino (who I absolutely love) and I know that I will not be the last person to say that after seeing both of their works. In short, Duffy's ""Boondock Saints"" had the same atmosphere and edgy wit and humor that a Tarentino flick would have, only better!

Anyway, I had never heard of this movie before, but picked it up on the chance that it would be somewhat entertaining. I was right and ended up renting Part 2.  Definitely see it if you haven't had the chance already. It's brilliant!",1272585600,,2439,4.662790697674419

1434398,1,B00005IC54,"""The Boondock Saints"" is a teenage fairytale, full of graphic gore, heart-pounding shoot-outs and escapes, and plenty of tough one-liner jokes.  The ""F"" word was at least half the script, and bloody murders throughout.  It is the story of Irish twin brothers (Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus) who come to the conclusion that they have God's blessing to rid the world of evil.  They live in the middle of the Russian, Italian and Irish mafia, mob and gangs so their work is cut out for them.

Willem Dafoe plays a smart, eccentric FBI agent that is torn between arresting the Irish vigilantes or joining them.  He has seen too many criminals get away with murder or locked up for a minimal amount of time. On the downside, his 'discoveries' are generally improbable, and he joins in the illegal violence.

Overall, it is geared for teenagers, especially young boys.  They must have attended the movie enough that a sequel was made. ""The Boondock Saints"" overload of swearing becomes offensive and overwhelms you - I longed for more meaningful dialogue.",1271203200,18,1058,4.877094972067039

1434403,5,B00005IC54,"Bartender turned director Troy Duffy's contemporary action melodrama ""The Boondocks Saints"" bears all the influences of Quentin Tarantino with its ultra-violent shoot-outs, use of profanity, over-the-top situations, fractured time lines and gallery of memorable characters.  Two multi-lingual Irish lads from South Boston awaken one day after they hear the Lord tell them to hit the vigilante trail.  Actually, despite its far-fetched storyline, ""The Boondocks Saints"" spouts the message that evil flourishes only when good men look the other way.  Duffy hammers this theme home in an early scene  when the minister recaps the real-life tragedy of Kitty Genovese. In 1964, Genovese was raped and murdered near her home while thirteen eyewitnesses cowered in either fear or indifference to her plight back and did not intervene.  Consequently, ""The Boondocks Saints"" advocates vigilantism.  Unfortunately, whatever credibility that Duffy generates for his message is obliterated by those kinetically staged gunfights, rampant profanity, and the melodramatic plot twists.  Basically, ""The Boondocks Saints"" is a beer & pizza saga that shows some tolerance for homosexuality because one of its chief characters--an erudite FBI agent--is gay but not gay is an over-the-top way.  Sadly, this independently produced actioneer got lost in the politics of its day.  According to Duffy, the Columbine massacre prompted the distributers to curb release of the film because of its violent fare.  The heroes--who perform primarily good deeds--dress in black like the Columbine gunmen and wipe out Russian mobsters galore.  Nevertheless, this ranks as first-rate entertainment if you enjoy gritty gunplay, provocative characters, and some surreal staging.  People who love cats may not enjoy ""The Boondocks Saints"" because a cat is accidentally shot and splattered like a tomato against a wall  Of course, the actual cat was never harmed, but some cat lovers cannot differentiate between reality and illusion so this film may leave a dire taste in their mouths.

The Cold War has concluded and Russian criminals have migrated to America and the Russian syndicate is buying up property in Boston, much to the chagrin of some leaseholders, like poor old Doc (Gerard Parkes of ""Short Circuit 2"") a barkeeper afflicted with Tourette's syndrome who runs McGinty's Bar.  The patrons are celebrating Saint Patrick's Day when three imposing big bruisers, among them Ivan Checkov (Scott Griffith), walk in to lay down the law and encounter the McManus twins, Connor (Sean Patrick Flanery of ""The Suicide Kings"" ) and Murphy (Norman Reedus of ""Deuces Wild""), who precipitate a barroom brawl with them.  They tied the biggest Russian to the bar and set his butt on fire.  The next day two of the Russians, including burnt butt, barge into their apartment.  They handcuff Connor to a toilet and threaten to kill Murphy.  Connor rips out the toilet--possible but not likely--and goes to the roof and drops it on the biggest Russian and saves his brother from certain death.  FBI Special Agent Paul Smecker (Willem Dafoe of ""Platoon"") launches an investigation because he is part of the Organized Crime Task Force.  Smecker hooks himself up to his portable CD player, pops on his disposable gloves, and analyzes the crime scene to the strains of classic composer Puccini's operatic La bohme.  Although the chronology of the scene is fractured like a Tarantino bloodbath, Duffy appears to invoke the kind of cross-cutting that worked so well for Hong Kong director John Woo so that we get to see both the crime and the analysis of the crime.

Later, when Smecker presents the details of the crime to his colleagues, he is in the same shot with our heroes when they perform their community service. Our heroes give themselves up and Smecker lets them go and informs the Boston press that they killed the Russians in self-defense.  Later, our heroes hear voices and believe that the Lord wants them to destroy evil men.  The MacManus brothers receive help from one of their loony friends, David Della 'Roc (David Della 'Roc' of ""Jake's Corner""), who serves as an errand boy of sorts for the Boston mob.  He provides our heroes with all the information that they need to start wiping out mobsters with extreme prejudice.  Roc is the crazy one of the bunch and he lacks the focus of the MacManus twins.  Meanwhile, Smecker investigates each convoluted crime scene and shows the Boston Police, particularly the three detectives on the case, Dolly (David Ferry), Duffy (Brian Mahoney) and Greenly (Bob Marley), why he is such a genius.  By now, our heroes have become `saints' in the newspapers, and they obtain a cache of silenced automatic pistols with which to carry out their work.  When they ice top-level hoods, Connor and Murphy utter a prayer while they have their victim on his knees and shoot him through the back of the head so that their bullets exit through the eye sockets.  Afterward, they place pennies on the dead man's eyes.  Each execution gets wilder and crazier until the mobsters catch up with them.  Meanwhile, Smecker has so underestimated the MacManus brothers that he never imagines what they have been doing until Roc loses a finger during a shoot-out and he connects them with Roc.  By this time, the mob has declared war on them.

""The Boondocks Saints"" is for action-oriented film fans who know they are only watching a movie.  Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus are perfectly cast as brothers and they kindle a lot of charisma as vigilantes in the tradition of Charles Bronson from the ""Death Wish"" movies.  Make no mistake, however, Willem Dafoe and David Della 'Roc' steal the show.  Close behind them in his peripheral role is Gerard Parkes who has only a couple of scenes, but he is unforgettable, especially with his use of the F-bomb and the A-word followed in rapid succession.  Mind you, ""The Boondocks Saints"" is not remotely believable, but it is a terrific, entertaining, action-packed opus with colorful character, blue dialogue, and Duffy's imaginative staging.",1268524800,,6075,5.122718052738337

1434443,4,B00005IC54,"The word legendary is not normally associated to a movie with a relatively disappointing initial release.  Word of mouth and a strong underground following, however, has turned Boondock Saints into one of the most revered and appreciated movies of all time, with a cult following large enough to elicit a sequel nearly a decade later.

At its core Boondock Saints is about the classic dichotomy of good and evil.  Immersed in an overall theme of religious judgment and vindication amidst rampant organized crime in downtown Boston, two brothers - Connor and Murphy MacManus - live an ascetic lifestyle and are divinely chosen as God's avenging angels to expunge earthly evil.  Known for their brutal and grisly killings, which leave incredibly bloody crime scenes, the brothers quickly garner a citywide following akin to John Dillinger's bank robbery semi-stardom.  While the city is torn, a tense crime scene investigator Paul Smecker (Willem Dafoe) assists, with as many idiosyncrasies as possible, the local police force in their efforts to decelerate a suddenly explosive sequence of murdered mafia members.

If a film with dozens of murders could ever be considered a ""feel good"" movie, this is it.  A liberal dosage of vigilante justice is always aided when supported by religious convictions, and the brothers - with their third-wheel, lower level Italian Mafia friend David ""The Funny Man"" Rocco - have the benefit of both.  As relayed through a confessional booth later in the movie, ""It's very easy to be sarcastic about religion, but it's much more difficult to take a stand.""  Indeed.

With tense action and a score that sounds like it was created by a few Gregorian monks who were exiled in a techno club with Michael Bay, the thematic pulse of Boondock Saints holds true from beginning to end, absolute, last second end.  While a bit weak on background details, the plot stands on its own and the shootout reenactments add just enough flair and excitement to avoid condescension.

I don't know if it deserves ALL the fawning and reputation, but it's a very good movie that is enjoyable on repeat viewings.

I watched this movie long after it became popular, barely got through it without trying to kill myself and desired to have all memory of it washed from my mind when it was over.  The basic formula for this story: Stereotypical, hard-drinking Irish brothers + Russian mafia (what are they doing here?) + FBI trailing the work of vigilantes = Repetitive ""plot"" of this exceptionally boring movie.

All these guys do is drink, play with guns and kill ""evil"" men they think God has appointed them to do so.  Most of the action scenes are shown in flashback, after a charismatic detective played by the Greatest Actor in the World, Willem Dafoe, brilliantly relates to a dumb subordinate and apparently half-baked bunch of second string FBI agents, or something.  Dafoe's character, who owns the best lines in the ""film,"" knows the leprechaun assassins are responsible for all of this violence but must see something in them others don't; this might provoke a short discussion about vigilantism, but one that's been had before, and only by the most desperate of viewers trying to squeeze something out of this movie.  Anyone else might proclaim the action scenes as ""bad-ass"" and the storyline altogether as ""groundbreaking"" but original this movie surely ain't.

This is probably what happened:
""Hey, let's make a movie about Irish vigilantes!""
""Awesome!  What happens?""
""What do you mean?  They're IRISH.  And they're VIGILANTES.  What else do you need to know?""
""Um... okay, sounds good.""

The premise for the movie was one page long, the dialogue heavily-accented and improvised.  Hell, anyone can write a movie.  Turns out they made a sequel to this movie.

""Hey, remember that movie about the Irish vigilantes?""
""Yeah, that was great!  Scathing reviews, totally awesome cult following though (primarily made of high school kids).""

""Okay.  What about?""

It's a rare, unique way of telling a violent story, making it very interesting to follow these two men in their endeavors.

Violence for the sake of violence is utterly boring, but in the movie, the violence is there to tell the story, and that makes it ok. I don't think there's to much of it, but certain scenes are rather full of it, and some of them are done in a way, that made me cry in laughter.

The film was really captivating and never boring.  To quickly sum it up it's about two brothers who decide to take the law into their own hands.  Being a fan of ""vigilante"" films I was quickly drawn into the movie.  While it's not all action and violence, there's definitely plenty of it here...But it takes a second seat to the story which is very refreshing since a lot of movies of this ilk are all flash and no depth.

My only complaint lies with the blu-ray transfer.  It seems like it's just the dvd transfer upscaled which is a little dissapointing.  Some scenes look pretty good, while others have some heavy grain.  The sound is good though, thankfully.  Extra wise you're getting two commentaries, deleted scenes, outtakes, a printable script, and a trailer.

Even with the dull transfer, I'd recommend this to any fan of crime cinema...You won't regret checking this one out.",1245888000,10,1040,4.5675675675675675

I thoroughly enjoyed this off-beat indie gem, even though it looked like it had been badly chopped about in places (Willem Dafoe's conversion to the brother's cause in particular seemed a tad too speedy to be convincing and smacked of the dreaded 'studio interference') and the ""reconstruction of the murder scene"" device was probably used one time more than it needed to be. That said, how can you not love a film which features a gay FBI genius who smacks his sexual conquests for trying to snuggle, murder by flying toilet, Russian mobsters having their arses set on fire, the accidental and gratuitous murder of a cat (wrong, but funny), Billy Connolly as an insane gunman and cameos by Ron Jeremy and Jeanna Fine?  It's a pity that director Troy Duffy has apparently royally stuffed up his chances of ever making another movie due to his clashes with the Weinsteins as he'd have made a great 'Punisher' movie given half the chance. Then again that idea is probably redundant as, lets be honest, he sort of did it with this film anyway.",1235174400,,1086,4.746031746031746

This is a movie that applies to a vast majority of the world. Law enforcement is bound by rules and regulations. Wouldn't it be great if someone just... killed all those rapists? child molesters? murderers? And if you have the blessing of God, then who can stop you?

This movie chose some awesome actors, great humor (I LOVE it when characters say a thing such as ""this isn't a movie, you know.""), and the way the story was told was very unique. My only let down? My favorite scene in the movie, wasn't in the movie (the scene with mom, found in the special features).

I'm sorry people didn't think this resembled Pulp Fiction... who cares? If you want to write a review about Pulp Fiction, don't do it here. Boondock Saints is it's own movie. Rate it as such. And as such, I give it 5 stars and recommend it to everyone I know.",1235001600,,1007,4.345744680851064

1434652,4,B00005IC54,"I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised. It made me think of a religious version of one of the many slightly comedic mob movies like ""Snatch"". Two young Irish Catholic brothers decide that evil is rampant. When the Catholic priest tells his church about a elderly woman that was killed with people standing around doing nothing, the men decide things have gone to far. They still don't do anything until some Russian mobsters try to kick them out of a pub that belongs to a friend. Even then they just beat up the mobsters, but when the mobster break into their apartment and try to kill them they start to change. The change at first is minor but as they are supported by the City of Boston they become more bold in removing evil from the streets. Brilliant directing, good production values, and plenty of action make this well worth checking out. Willem Defoe as the gay FBI agent and Sean PAtrick Flanery and Norman Reedus as the brothers are outstanding, and the rest the cast are good. The story never takes itself to seriously and the introduction of a hitman that even the mob fears adds just another layer of icing. Well worth renting and I bought a copy myself. The DVD is great quality and has good replayability. If you enjoyed this catch ""Layer Cake""

1434693,5,B00005IC54,"THE BOONDOCK SAINTS is the best movie I have ever seen! It's perfect in every way! The story, the action, it's flawless! The only thing that I don't like is the use of the F word about 270 times, but who cares? This movie more then makes up for the language! Anyone who has not seen this film needs to, and if you hate it then you don't know what a good movie is! This film may be offensive to some, yes, but overall, it is near perfection, and director Troy Duffy has made a masterpiece of epic proportions. Seriously, don't listen to the haters, they don't know crap about good movies!

This movie is mainly crime-based, but it's no ordinary detective story, this film is literally in kind of a genre all it's own, it just has everything it needs, and lacks nothing. Like I said, every film has it's flaws, but this movie actually makes up for all it's flaws, just in the way it's presented. I would give this film more then 5 stars if I could, it is really that amazing.

Also, anyone looking at the date of ""2000"" and saying, well this is old, it can't look that bad right? WRONG! This film looks just as good if not better then half the bullcrap Hollywood is pumping out nowadays! There is not allot of CGI or specials effects, it's just not that type of film, but the stunts are amazing and everything is smooth and perfect, and not choppy whatsoever. So throw any fear of this film being under par right out the window.

Also, since there are people like this, THIS IS NOT A FILM FOR KIDS! I hate people who do that, I saw Watchmen like a week ago *which was amazing by the way... :)* and I saw kids in the theater! When will people learn what an ""R"" rating means??? Just saying, if you looking to buy this and it's for someone younger, then I don't recommend it, it's for mature audiences only.

All in all, this film is a masterpiece, a gem, and will forever take place among my all time favorite films. My three favorite films are Watchmen, The Dark Knight, and The Boondock Saints *which is actually THE best one*, so believe me when I say that you should give this film a try, but go in expecting some mature materiel and some offensive language, but other then that, enjoy the ride and in no time you'll be repeating the phrase:

And shepards we shall be,
For Thee my Lord, for Thee.
Power hath descended forth from Thy hand,
That our feet my swiftly carry out Thy command.
We shall flow a river forth unto thee,
And teeming with souls shall it ever be.

1434698,4,B00005IC54,"The film Boodock Saints can be considered a cult classic, but this title also hurts it. Many people do not look past the language or the sheer impossibility of these circumstances ever happening. This film is fun to watch, has quirky lines and situations, and even has a moral.
Brothers Connor and Murphy exemplify true Bostonian Irishmen. They drink, smoke, and go to church...all in the same day while saying numerous explitives. But their intentions and hearts are pure. They may seem like stupid immigrants, but they show their intelligence in the interrogation scene. They converse in five different languages, telling the detective that their mother wanted them to be well-rounded. It's hard to believe that these so-called scumbags could be intelligent, but the movie's purpose, after all, is to break down barriors.
There are many characters in which make the movie what it is. Detective Paul Smecker serves as most of the comic relief, listening to opera at crime scenes. The fact that he is uncharacteristically gay makes him even more funny. Rocco also brings stupidity into the mix, along with a penchent for not thinking and slutty women.
The best part about this movie is the culture it brings to life. The boys continuously use Roman Catholic prayers and even Latin. Connor and Murphy have tattoos on their hands, stating ""veritas"" and ""aequitas,"" which mean truth and justice, respectively. They continually use the Latin for ""In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen."" usually shooting their victim on the word ""Amen."" The ritual that they perform of crossing their victim's arms and putting coins in their eyes represents that the killing was religious and necessary. Another interesting fact is the quote from Dante's Inferno which appears on the door to a club in which they are performing a killing. ""Abandon hope, ye who enter here"" is written in blood, signifying more knowledge of culture.
The moral of the movie is that these boys are taking on a God-like persona by killing the people they feel are evil. The police know this is happening, and even facilitate it because they know it is right to do. This film brings to light the idea of a stricter death penalty and other punishments, along with civilian heros.

This movie successfully combines intense action with few unexpected quirky and funny comments to lighten the mood. It's a very strong movie with strong beliefs.

These 2 brothers are religious and after a slight run in with the Russian mob decide to practice vigilante justice under the pretense of cleansing the city of sinners. These guys do what each of us imagine we could do to the trash of the community. They begin to target members of the Russian mob as well as the Italian mob. Meanwhile Dafoe's character has an internal conflict like most of the viewers... are these guys doing right or wrong? One hand these guys being hunted down are bad men feeding off the innocent who's going to miss them? As an officer of the law Dafoe's character's hands are tied as to what he can do to them. On the other hand killing is wrong and these guys have right too.

Quentin Tarentino has never done an original film in his life. Its all just homaige and 1970s explotation nostalgia. The other thing it has that Tarantino doesn't have is a sense of humor. In a certain way it owes more to something like fight club than tarantino. There are lots of ""stand up and be a man"" moments in the film.

The structure of the film with the police investigating what happened and then showing what happened worked well. The flaws in the film are a slow start and the lack of an ending. Its a film with a particular audience and appeal. Its not going to go over well with people outside that audience.

The film should really be remade with a bigger budget. With tweaks to the script and some more expensive action sequences, a new version of this film marketed properly would bring in a ton of money.",1220659200,,972,4.455056179775281

1434740,2,B00005IC54,"The Boondock Saints (1999), promises action, intrigue, an exposure
of the underworld and much more. Unfortunately, the mass appeal
of this movie simply is not there, as this work is a lot like FIGHT CLUB,
in that there is a demented story, totally disconnected from reality,
illogical,  and very niche-minded in terms of the movie fan base who
will want to see this work again.

First, the entertainment aspect is questionable, for various reasons;
the foremost one being, the blood packs going off on a regular basis,
every 5 minutes, in various environments across Boston, every single
time with a Matrix-inspired slow motion of bullets, glass flying everywhere,
with the dynamic duo spewing bullets with semi-automatic weapons as if
there was an unlimited magazine of bullets in each pistol.

Secondly, there is an offensive suggestion that righteousness, vigilantism,
and the practice of  reciting prayers and familiarity with religious chants is
the one and the same with a  need for mass murder and lack of forgiveness
in others; the offenders cannot see past their noses or their own misgivings and

defects - which is not found in any religious teaching in Christianity,
except perhaps the one spoken about in this movie.

Third, there is a confusing interplay of the historical Boston,  the
Irish Boston of the 1800's, the pubs, of St. Patrick's Day with modern-day
Boston, and the Russian mob, in the post- Berlin era with former KBG and
soviet Union military retrained as mobsters to enforce the dreams of  real
estate speculators buying out properties in the USA for large scale projects.
Needless to say, the cursing and swearing seems futile in many cases, or
displaced to say the least ...

Law enforcement is not presented almost at all, or  accurately at that
which is sorely confirmed over the entire picture.

The redeeming qualities of this picture (which unfortunately, fails to
carry the viewers in another time and space ...but rather, just makes
them frown time and again, in between hopes of the picture picking up,
making more sense, and getting morem - mature,  doesn't happen) is Defoe,
playing a bisexual FBI detective, who investigates the vigilantism
occurring, and who at length, is torn between his own beliefs about the
need to clean up ruthlessly the underworld as it touches upon the majority
of the population who live their own lives in normalcy, versus his obligation
as a peace officer to investigate those who pulled the trigger,  gather
evidence, and place them behind bars. His acting is vivid, fresh, articulate,
convincing, sincere, professional ...with some funny moments as the paradox
of his sexuality is exposed in his own attitudes and behavior.

The  filming  and editing of this  movie is flawless, but with a more
complex, ambigious strategy as far as the soundtrack goes, from the eclectic
choices, ranging from Bach's Brandenburg Concertos, to Matrix-style synth
pop in the action scenes, etc.

The film makers juxtapose  mind-numbing bloodbaths occurring time and again,
with Operatic and Church chants,  suggesting that, those committing violence

and deeds completely out of the bounds of the imagination, did lose touch
with their own humanity,  feelings,  rapport with society and their loved
ones, entering the realm of insanity, of course. One learns early that when
pain ceases to be felt, the body is vulnerable to maximum damage in risky
environments.

Overall, the potential of this work is almost entirely wasted, as it almost
seems inspired by  FIGHT CLUB 3 years after the fact, in terms of
its unrealism, and admiration for when a man surrenders his own humanity
and goes insane, through ultra-violence. However, it is worthy of a rental
just to see the filming, scenes of Boston, and Defoe, however.",1212624000,3,3770,5.099348534201955

I found the story of two Irish brothers performing incredibly violent and at times implausible acts of vigilantism entertaining enough. At times the plot seemed a bit disjointed and jumpy. However Willem Dafoe's performance as a federal agent on their trail is so over the top and campy that I think he stole the movie.

1434783,1,B00005IC54,"People call this movie a ""cult favorite."" That is a completely appropriate term because one really needs to be a half-lobotomized member of a cult in order to find this movie watchable. After all, this movie was only shown in 5 theaters and failed miserably after a week. The only reason it has had some success on DVD was because Blockbuster Video was conned into buying thousands of copies and had to promote it heavily as a ""Blockbuster Exclusive"" in order to recoup their losses. Like cult members, enough of the public obeyed the video store's directive, and Boondock Saints found a loyal audience among college students who find it strangely entertaining when they're high. This movie is bad...really, really bad. It defines bad. It's not even bad in a funny way, like a cheesy foreign action flick or Mystery Science Theatre 3000 selection. It's just plain unbearable. In every conceivable way it is a juvenile, amateurish, and boring failure of a movie that seems like it was written and produced by a 13 year old simpleton.

The dialogue is spectacularly awful. At least 40% of it doesn't even make coherent sense in the English language, which makes me think that much of the script was written by a committee of Mexican day laborers. The other half consists of cliched action movie quips that people wouldn't actually say in real life. Maybe that's why the acting was so terrible; I think the actors obviously realized what garbage they were given to work with, so they purposely recited their lines in a very artificial, sing-songy manner, so as to convey a tacit message to the audience, like American POWs in enemy propaganda films: ""I know this movie is trash, I know this dialogue is an embarrassment to you and me, but the contracts have already been signed and I'm legally obligated to repeat the words they give me to say. However, I want you to know that my spirit hasn't been broken by my captors, so I'm going to read my lines with all the disrespect and mockery they deserve."" Someone must have had incriminating photos of William Dafoe to have coerced him into appearing in such a disaster (as a gay, cross-dressing FBI agent).

The plot is as inane as all the other elements in Boondock Saints. Two seemingly ultra-pious Irish Catholics (who also associate with mobsters, blaspheme, kill and pull out guns in a Confessional) suddenly decide to start killing evil men. And that is the entirety of the plot, except for an idiotic revelation that the homicidal hit man trying to kill them is actually their father. Character development is non existent; everything about these people is one-dimensional and unmemorable. They are essentially video game characters. Everyone's motivation is either unexplained or nonsensical, and so much of this story is just riddled with holes, non-sequiturs and plain imbecility.

One critic said that this movie was all about style over substance. I agree that there is no substance here, but I also don't see any style, which even a one-note hack like Tarantino has. Stylistically, this is the equivalent of a man in a brown suit with a green tie and a bad comb over. You know he'd like to be thought of as hip, but he's just not succeeding. This may very well be the worst movie ever made. Don't say you haven't been warned.",1211414400,22,3283,4.786596119929453

1434786,5,B00005IC54,"(Spoilers included)

There are a TON of messages throughout this movie, probably the most prominent is the beginning:

""...and I am reminded of this holy day of the sad story of Kitty Geneviese. As you all may remember a long time ago, almost 30 years ago... This poor soul cried out for help time and time again but no person answered her calls. Though many saw, not one so much as called the Police. They all just watched as Kitty was being stabbed to death in broad daylight. They watched as her assailant walked away. Now we must all fear evil men but there is another kind of evil which we must fear most... and that is the indifference of good men.""

So many times I've watched videos of people being robbed, beaten, shot, stabbed, and then heard stories of similar things on the news where NO ONE so much as helped or called the Police. A woman, bled to death on the emergency room floor, because no one made an attempt to help her.

This world is all about self preservation, and I think they noted that well in this movie. Throughout the hour and 50 minutes (give or take) the director made a point to really dig into the mentality of this world and show what two men that have had enough, can do.

Sure it delves a bit on the supernatural or ""godly"" when they receive their ""message"" while in the jail cell. But it doesn't go overboard. The director adds a ton of humor and light points and doesn't make the brothers appear to be unstoppable or invincible.

I have yet to find a movie that made me laugh as hard as this one did in the scene where Rocco slams his fist down on a table and shoots a cat. ""Is it dead?"" CLASSIC.

This movie ranks up with my top three all time movies. I can't give it enough stars. Classic script, direction, music, character development... there's EVERYTHING in this movie. The best lines from the entire movie for me, is the end:

""You people have been chosen to reveal our existence to the world! You will witness what happens here today, and you will tell of it later. All eyes to the front.""

""Now you will receive us! We do not ask for your poor, or hungry. We do not want your tired or sick! It is your corrupt we claim! It will be your evil that will be sought by us! With every breath, we shall hunt them down! Each day we will spill their blood, till it rains down from the skies! Do not kill, do not rape, do not steal. These are principles that every man of every faith can embrace! These are not polite suggestions, these are codes of behavior, and those of you that ignore them will pay the dearest cost! There are varying degrees of evil. We urge you lesser forms of filth not to push the bounds and cross over into true corruption... into our domain. For it you do, one day you will look behind you, and see we three, and on that day you will reap it! ... and we will send you to whichever god you wish!""

1434836,5,B00005IC54,"It's a great feeling when you rent a movie that it was actually worth getting. Especially when you find one that is completely under the radar.  After countless times of seeing this movie on the shelf and on TV, I finally tell myself to watch it. Of course when I decide to watch it, it completely disappears from the TV stations so I have to spend a few bucks.

Sean Patrick Flannery and Norman Reedus play fraternal twins Connor and McManus. While having a drink at the local bar the two and a few buddies run into some problems. Apparently, the bars owner is being forced by the Russian mob to sell the property. When the mob comes to have a chat they soon find that the brothers aren't heaving it. They ask the men to leave nicely but they refuse to go and start a fight. Next thing you know two bodies show up outback of the bar. After some thought and a few more bodies the two think of an idea. They get their guns and become vigilantes. They are going after every corrupt and villainous man in Boston.

With the help of their buddy who was a package boy for the Italian mob they plan to bring down everyone. ""The Boondock saints"" is certainly not hard to throw a five star rating on. I'll get to all the good stuff first. The overall feel of the movie is amazing, the pacing and camera work are very well done. I believe the script could've been a tad bit better but it still works. Flannery and Reedus were both on point but what made the movie better was that they had a great supporting cast. William Dafoe was sick as agent Smecker and I don't think anyone else could've played him that well.

The chemistry between the actors completes the film. Because they seem like they are truly these characters it gives the movie that extra bit of realness. If anything I didn't like the way some scenes were filmed. When it came time for the action scenes, the action sounds went completely away. It was replaced with music, which may be okay for some but not me. It's nothing to take a star away for but it's just my personal preference. I like the feeling and rush you get when you hear the explosions and shootouts. What more can I say? The movie is on point and even better it has a sequel coming soon.

1434837,4,B00005IC54,"""The Boondock Saints"" is probably the first violent, stylized, kill-em-all film that I would describe as a ""feel good"" movie.  That this film has achieved such cult status is a combination of the film's stylized direction and dialogue, and the idea of a couple of regular guys enforcing their brand of justice on all these bad guys.  Let's face it.  If you had the opportunity and the lack of inhibitions, wouldn't you do what these guys do?

The film has been panned by many top critics for it's highly derivitive style.  True, the bible passage shouting before you kill a guy has been done by Tarantino.  True also is that the idea of the detective listening to opera while investigating seems to borrow a bit from John Woo (as well as some of the action scenes), but the fun here is that Troy Duffy and co don't take any of it seriously.  The brothers are a fun duo.  But it's Willem Dafoe who steals the show.

Willem Dafoe plays cross dressing gay FBI agent Paul Smecker, who is probably the most original character Duffy has crafted for the film.  He has the best lines.  Dafoe plays the character so straight (and I use the term loosely) that he's made this character.  He plays Smecker as very proficient, but with a lot of quirks.

Since Tarantino, there's been a lot a lot of so called derivative films that critics have had a lot of disdain for.  Boondock Saints is one of those films.  While the dialogue and style doesn't rise to Tarantino levels, it's still good in its own right.  And it's not a blatant rip off, though it'd be tough to say those films didn't inspire how this picture is shot.  There are some non linear sequences, but they have their own unique flare.  Duffy shows us a scene and uses Smecker to go back and see what happened.

Boondock Saints is a fun film.  There's reasons to see how it has reached cult status.  While it's not one of the best films ever made, it does leave you with a certain feeling.  Our heroes are likeable and we're cheering them on throughout the film.  In some ways, it has the flare of a crazed underground vigilante superhero film, complete with larger than life characters.

OK, Willem Defoe, FBI investigator who mentally re-enacts crimes while listening to classical music under headsets. He treats the local police with total distain to the point of sending them for coffee and doughnuts for dumb comments. He has other personality quirks that are very well acted.

The two lead actors playing the Irish twin brothers were perfecly cast and I really feel they got into their characters perfectly.  Willem Dafoe was really the perfect choice for his role, he developed his character so well it was really believable.  Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus, as the Irish fraternal twins who go on a violent and bloody killing spree (only the very corrupt, evil criminals who somehow evade the law) and give the concept of ""vigilante"" a whole new energy.  Billy Connely, whose character comes in rather later in the movie, didn't have an excess of lines, but his facial expressions and body language just make his character.

This movie is full of energy, violence, lots of blood (disclaimer: if you're sensitive to movie-blood and gunplay, or profane/obscene language, this may not be the movie for you), and a new take on the concept of people who feel they're forced to become vigilantes because of their perception of loopholes and red tape contained in our law system.

I just wish Troy Duffy (writer and director) would get his act together and somehow make amends with the industry, as there was supposed to be a sequel, and I would love to see the further adventures of Connor and Murphy, but from what I've heard, the promised sequel just isn't going to happen.

Great movie, I'd put it in my Top 5 of my favorite movies and if you're lucky enough to view the 2 disc version, you'll get to see some interesting (and one hilarious) deleted scenes, some cute outtakes, etc.  IMHO, this is a 5 star movie.",1193702400,,1829,4.634674922600619
1434881,5,B00005IC54,"Ok, i loved this movie, loved the acting (and the over acting).  William Dafoe is great in it and the Irish brothers make you want to jump in the movie.  Yes, not everyone likes it but it seems the people that don't like it are the uptight elitist of the movie world.  If you aren't one of them, give the movie a shot.

What i don't like about it; the ending.  It could have been done better, but as sore a thumb as it is in the movie, it doesn't really matter that much.

What i LOVED about the movie; the way Dafoe's character narrates the killings.  The movie brings you up to the point of the brothers about to ""clean up"" another piece of scum but then cuts off, leaving the police to show how it happened later.  This leads to what i think is an amazing scene were Dafoe superimposes himself into one of the shootings (loved that).  And another thing i think they did well was the music, and how the music matches up to the actions of the main characters.

So not everyone will like it, but give it a try.  I think you rather rent a movie, it turn out to not be to your liking; then to miss out on something a lot of people enjoy so much.  After all, who buys a special edition movie if they haven't even seen it yet?",1193616000,2,1222,4.066945606694561

1434884,5,B00005IC54,"This is a great over-the-top crime comedy.  No big surprise its become a cult classic.  It's cathartic seeing the bad guys get theirs.

""Boondock Saints"" is the tale of two everyday Irish brothers, fraternal twins, Connor McManus (Sean Patrick Flanery) and Murphy McManus (Norman Reedus) who accidentally get into a life of crime when some Russian Mafia types try to close down their bar on Saint Paddy's Day.  From there, they decide to clean up the streets.  FBI ""Very"" Special Agent Smecker (Willem Dafoe) and the Boston Police are hot on their heels.  The story is told in a disjoint fashion, but is pretty easy to follow even when I had to interrupt the disk for phone calls.

In my opinion, the best performance is Willem Dafoe as FBI Agent Paul Smecker. I'm so used to the more serious roles he's played, he had me laughing through the whole show.

I rented ""Boondock Saints"" out of curiousity, but I'm buying a copy so I can see it again and show it to friends.  And--IMHO, it's much better than ""Pulp Fiction.""",1192406400,5,1019,4.616666666666666

Anyone who says it wasn't hasn't seen a comedic crime film made in the past decade.  That being said, though, Saints does tend to follow its own path.  There is far less humor, which may not have been intentional; to me, the jokes just weren't funny.  The characters are also, for the most part, far less unique and entertaining.  We learned practically nothing about any of the ""bad guys"" in the film, who ended up being nothing but cardboard cutouts.  Dialogue was also fairly weak and the acting could only be called so-so.  The character of Rocco, who would have been irritating as only a bit player, was achingly irritating as a main character.  The chemistry between the two brothers was good and the action scenes were fairly well done, but otherwsie the only saving grace for this film was Willem Defoe as the over-the-top FBI man.  Without his role, this movie would have rated a two at best.  As it is, I would label it a watchable---yet forgettable---movie.",1191974400,2,1109,4.729166666666667

Those that compare it to pulp fiction don't realize that there are not that many similarities between the two films. The greatness of this film is in
1. The chemistry between the fraternal twin brothers Murphy and Connor. The interaction between the two make up, in my humble opinion, the best, funniest, wittiest and emotionally wrought scenes in the film.
2. The out of stereotype characters that make up the other key players. *there are some stereotypical characters in this film, however, all movies have them, but they are funny and needed * Detective Smecker and Rocco are two original, well acted and interesting guys that add greatly to the film.
3. The fact that the movie doesn't take itself too seriously. You are supposed to laugh, suspend belief and have fun while watching this. You are also going to cringe at the shootouts and get excited during the action scenes which are pretty damn cool.

Most reviewers for this film are guys, but I'm not, and I was tipped off to see this by a girl friend of mine. I immediately went out and got my own copy. I've watched it about 5 times, and keep finding more I like about it every time I watch it again.

4.  A pretentious overtone.

1434918,5,B00005IC54,"The Boondock Saints (italicize), released in 1999, could possibly be described as a ""cult flick,"" since it never saw intense gains at the box office during its theatrical release.  However, it is a fantastic drama with both memorable characters and fantastic performances from some up-and-coming Hollywood names.

Sean Patrick Flannery and Norman Reedus star as devoutly Irish Catholic twin brothers, Connor and Murphy McManus, whose chance bar fight with Russian mobsters leads them to killing two peons in self-defense.  After spending a night in jail and being released without charges, the two come to believe they are supernaturally appointed to enact God's justice on evil men.  A virtual slaughter of vigilantism ensues, with the brothers and their new recruit, David Della Rocco, taking out all that is evil in South Boston.  When the killings begin to hit closer and closer to home for infamous mafia don ""Papa Joe"" Yakavetta, he secures the release of an old family hit man, the mysterious ""Il Duche.""

Willem Dafoe gives a smashing performance as Paul Smecker , the anomalous FBI agent assigned to investigate the mob-related killings.  His uncanny detective skills soon have him hot on the trail of the two brothers, and once Smecker realizes the particular brand of vigilantism the brothers are executing, he must make a choice to either take them down or enable their continuance.

With choppy dramatic sequencing including flashbacks and layered scene cutting, a few critics have compared the style of The Boondock Saints to that of Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction.  Some even write it off as a cheap imitation.  However, the memorable characters, unique humor and religious twist of The Boondock Saints ensures that it holds its own place in the line of ""shoot-`em-up"" mobster movies.

1434961,5,B00005IC54,"I am in total agreement with Michael on this one.

First of all, Pulp Fiction?  Where does that come from?  Yes, Saints may feature some glorified violence, but beyond that it resembles in no way any of Tarantino's flicks, be it Pulp Fiction or Resevoir Dogs.  I think the closest it could resemble Tarantino otherwise is in the the little funny moments that Duffy includes, like the cat scene.  Otherwise, the plots are completely different, the characters are in no way similar, nor are the endings.

Secondly, what kind of person would see the previews for this and walk into it expecting something on par with Fight Club?  If you know anything of the background of Fight Club, noone could put it in the same genre or say it has similar features as Saints.  Fight Club is a psychological mindbender of a flick based on a book, and it is very faithful to the novel.  Boondock Saints is a pure action flick that allows you to analyze moral issues if you feel like it without forcing it on you.

Now, a couple of small points.  Willem Defoe's character: Flamboyantly gay, yes.  Homophobe, no.  He, like many men just wants to love 'em and leave 'em.  He doesn't fear gay people in the least.

And lastly, the F-word laced dialogue.  If you have ever been to Southy in Boston, you would know that the F-word is as common there as the word 'the.'  When you throw a mass of working class people into below-code housing, multiple pubs and a low literacy rate, what else would you expect?

All in all, Boondock Saints is a UNIQUE, well-made movie, that while not groundbreaking, is an excellent movie considering its lowish budget and modest support from major studios (which by the way is one of the main reasons it became a cult hit.)",1180915200,8,1731,4.546925566343042

Not denying your right to an opinion but you've based yours on such a shaky, ignorant foundation you come off as daft. (You alternately claimed it was a Pulp Fiction rip off - which is so out in wonderland I must ask what you were smoking - and that you thought you were getting a version of Fight Club, while praising that tepid piece of manure.)

The movie is certainly one of those, ""you like it or you don't"" kind of flicks. If you follow the movie's premise of vigilantism and accept that you are going to have a great time. If you gag on the premise, you'll likely spend too much of your time going over your philosophical and moral objections to taking the law into your own hands to enjoy a second of it.

Even the stylized/romanticized over-the-top violence in this film is done without any aesthetic flare or sincerity. The dialogue is uninspired, the plot is contrived (oh my, the mysterious, impossible-to-kill uber-hitman is the protagonists' long-lost father, I didn't see that one coming!), and the thematic concepts are lazily presented, if at all. One cares so little for the characters, who are little more than set-piece fillers, that watching the film becomes an exercise in waiting to see if some thug will put them out of their misery.

This film was written and directed by an arrogant, self-absorbed, and ultimately self-destructive Tarantino wannabe, who deservedly fell out of favor with Mirimax after haphazardly riding the hipster-action flick wave to get any sort of attention in the first place. The documentary Overnight is a much more enjoyable film that depicts director Troy Duffy's decline while filming this Reservoir Dogs clone. You can almost detect his seething arrogance and malignant self-love while watching this film. If only he had the story-telling skills to back his ego.

If only Duffy had actually explored the tacked-on religious symbolism featured in the film, or if he actually discussed the justification for vigilante justice or the origins of crime and punishment, we would have a film that was, in some small way, relevant. But instead we are presented with a fraud, a Blockbuster-engineered ""cult"" film that hopes to convince the audience that lacing screaming dialogue with the ""F"" word and including a flamboyantly gay homophobe in the picture makes it cool.

I cannot understand why this film has achieved cult status other than the simple fact that it did not have a wide theatrical release and Blockbuster Video promoted it as part of its direct-to-video marketing gimmick. Before I saw this film, I had assumed that it was a ""Fight Club""-esque film that was bold, stylish, and daring.

1434995,4,B00005IC54,"The Boondock Saints is rich with symbolism and pop culture disdain, while making a statement that things have gotten out of control with a film that got out of control.  The irony is steep, intention and not, throughout the film and the backstory.

Up front and center, I liked the movie.  It ranks with the better films in a genre that arguably owes homage to Reservoir Dogs.  The Tarantino elements are rich and clear, but not ripped off - a clear distinction for me. Duffy created a wild picture full of violence, but where he parted ways with Tarantino was in the significance of life in South Boston.  These people are victimized by crime and shoddy policemanship and every day is an exercise in futility.  Duffy brings to the screen the drama that answers the question, ""what would you do about it?""

The brothers, two tough Irish kids have enough when assaulted and nearly killed by pissed off Russians.  Something snaps inside them, something religious and right, something straight out of the worst war of heaven.  They take this religion and make it a religion of violence, exacting revenge against the mob for injustices done to every Irish mother and daughter, son and father, throughout blue-collar Boston.  It's not realistic, but it's realism, the dream that tough kids wanting to make a difference share throughout our violent society.

Where Duffy really makes his mark, however, is in the freedom of artistic excess he portrays.  The FBI agent is gay and crossdresses.  The funny man hates his mob bosses and tells particularly unfunny jokes.  The cops are clowns, but not intentionally, it's just a system they don't think they can make a difference in.  The gags aren't funny so much as ironic, like the brothers falling through a ceiling into a mob meeting, hanging upside down accidentally tangled in ropes, yet still succeed in their mission.  Mission Impossible meets Hannah Barbara with an R-rating and blood splatter.

Irish Catholicism seeps through the pours of these brothers and this film, centering on cathedrals and confessionals, and a prayer that guides their murderous ways.

And shepherds we shall be

For Thee, my Lord, for Thee

Power hath descended forth from Thy hand

That our feet may swiftly carry out Thy command

So we shall flow a river forth to Thee

And teeming with souls shall it ever be

In nomine Patri, et Filii, et Spiriti Sancti

In fact, maybe not Tarantino - this film actually comes closer to an American version of Guy Ritchie's films than any other American movie I have seen.

It's great fun on one level, disturbing on another, with religious overtones so strong that no Catholic church allowed the movie to film its sanctuary.  It will even get you talking about the idea of vigilantism - good thing or bad - how far is too far?

Plot has been elaborated on elsewhere, but basically two brothers who work in a meat factory in Boston get into a fight at their bar which results in the deaths of two `bad guy' Russians.  This empowers them to feel they are on a mission from God to cleanse the world of `bad guys'.  Meanwhile, Willem Defoe plays a gay FBI genius on their trail - his portrayal of a man almost over the edge in various ways, is a real highlight.

Music is great, with thumping soundtrack and choral music making an unlikely but oddly effective combination - and the photography belies the low budget and short shoot (just 32 days).  Billy Connolly appears late in the movie sporting an awful Irish accent, in a short but pivotal role.

1435119,4,B00005IC54,"THE BOONDOCK SAINTS is a movie with some great characters and one big plot problem.

The film's premise is interesting and brings a new take on an old movie theme: vigilantism. Charles Bronson of the DEATH WISH series rules this roost, but all of these are seriously dated now. DEFIANCE (1980), starring Jan-Michael Vincent, was another great flick that focused on a citizen taking the proverbial bite out of crime in an otherwise corrupt neighborhood. So I was pleased to see something a bit fresher appear on celluloid with this oft-thought-of overused message.

In The Boondock Saints we find twin brothers Connor and Murphy MacManus taking on the vigilante mantle by any bloody means necessary. And I do mean bloody. They also view themselves as instruments of God (as seen in the opening sequence in which they are in church listening to the funerary services for an innocent victim). Once on the streets, they tuck their crosses beneath their shirts and pull out their chosen weapons ...usually ones infused with gunpowder. They also say a special prayer before shooting their final bad-guy of the day, a prayer their father taught them. Oh. And their Irish, in case you didn't catch their last names. So we have to have the typical Irish pub in the area. And this is where much of the movie's success comes from. The absolutely amazing characters are what drives it.

The pub owner is an old Irish coot who is being forced to sell his bar by the local Russian mob. But when the vigilante brothers show up and learn of it, they quickly make sure one of their favorite hangouts isn't manhandled by any outsiders. The Irish pub owner is thankful to the brothers, and it's amazingly funny how he thanks them because the old guy has Tourettes Syndrome (a tic disorder that often results in uncontrollable cursing outbursts).

The Irish brothers also have a close friend named ""Funny Man"" Rocco (played by coked-out looking David Della Rocco) who has mob issues of his own. His ""boss"" is trying to rub him out and when Funny Man learns of it, he takes matters into his own hands as well as becoming a third party to the MaManus brothers' cause.

Hot on their tails is flamboyantly gay FBI agent Paul Smecker, played by Willem Dafoe. It is Dafoe's character that really elevates The Boondock Saints to a higher level. His witty comments and astonishing detective abilities mixed with his social/sexual preferences are pulled off effortlessly. Watching him go over a crime scene while listening to opera is something to be marveled at.

The downside is that this is a pretty bloody flick, spilling as much crimson as any slasher film. But the biggest issue some may have is that there's no background for the MacManus brothers. The audience never learns what trigger set them onto this path, so the viewers are just supposed to take what they're doing at face value. That's a pretty big pill to swallow. Set-up is important in the movies. But here's the thing. The Boondock Saints has such great characters, most watchers probably won't even notice this glitch.",1158796800,4,3060,4.79696394686907
1435120,5,B00005IC54,"This was a great movie and has a wonderful soundtrack that really helps captures the feel of the movie.

It's a well thought out movie that puts vigilante justice into an interesting light, though nothing is said that hasn't been said before.  The characters are well developed and the plot has it's share of surprises (for an action movie).

The ending leaves something to be desired and sets up for a sequel that was never released (thankfully, I think they would have ruined it).",1158624000,,482,4.714285714285714
1435121,4,B00005IC54,"First off, I am not new to this movie, have watched it many times, own the original DVD and this is def. one of my favorite movies of all time!  But I recently purchased this version because I have a widscreen TV and the Letterbox presentation found on the regular DVD did not compliment my TV at all, and I wanted the anamorphic presentation found on this version (and also the new THX sound).  It was worth every cent, and the picture/sound are beautiful!

Also, I would like to say that the actual movie gets 5 stars from me.  But I only gave this version 4 stars because as a Special Edition, it comes off a little weak; there is no booklet, the movie is 2-sided (one for WS and one for full-screen).  Some may prefer them being on one disk, but I have never liked that b/c the top is typically exposed to more abuse and if it gets scratched, there goes one version of the movie (and for some odd reason, they store the WS version on the top w/ the writing; this is the version I don't want to get damaged!).  The extras are just okay, and many of them I had already seen on the original DVD.  The tin they are stored in is very nice, though.

So should you buy this if you already own the old DVD?  If you want it strictly for the better sound and picture than ABSOLUTELY, and it was worth every cent to me!  But if you have an old TV and don't really care about that, then you are probably better off keeping the version you have.

1. They put a fullscreen version together with the widescreen in a flip disc. And I think flip disc sucks because you have to take extre care of it to make sure both sides don't scratch. And Fullscreen sucks I don't know why they put it in.

2. The extra scenes that they put in are maybe 2 or 3 mins and when you notice it you realize that those scenes are not even violent enough to have been cut out.

3. Disc 2 it's the same special features from the theatrical version. The only that made up for it a little bit is a couple of new deleted scenes.

Alot of people here wrote that this lived up to there expectations but it did not live up to mine. I though they could have had oh i don't know the whole cast in a commentary and not one by himself.

1435126,5,B00005IC54,"""The Boondock Saints"" is a movie that I don't even recall coming out but has somehow managed to develop an almost cult like status. And I can see why, it's definitely a very good, interesting, and original movie with some great performances. The biggest flaw with the whole movie is the final twist, which is cool but pretty unrealistic even in a movie like this. The Boondock Saints are Conner and Murphy McNamus (Sean Patrick Flannery & Norman Reedus), two Irish brothers in Boston who wind up killing two mob soldiers in self-defense. After they're cleared of any charges, they both have a vision and realize that they need to rid the world of evil. So, they begin to kill anyone who they deem evil. Meanwhile, a homosexual detective named Paul Smecker (Willem Dafoe, in one of his best and oddest performances) is tracking the two ""saints"" who leave every crime scene virtually clueless. As Conner and Murphy also recruit Rocco (who's played by a guy named David Della Rocco), a mob hand; Il Duce (Billy Connolly) a psychotic killer is unleashed on them. The movie proclaims on the back cover that if you liked ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"" you'll like this movie. One of those movies is my favorite movie of all time, so I guess that's true enough. But, this film isn't similar in any way to those two movies...But I do think that's a pretty good way to say it. If you liked those movies, you should like this. As an action movie, this is great...It's entertaining, there's a lot of shootouts. The way writer/director Troy Duffy directs the scenes are great. We don't see the shootout happen, but see the preparation; Then we see the cops looking the scene over, then...Flashback. The dialogue is pretty good and Dafoe's performance is perfectly over-the-top. Flannery & Reedus are perfectly cast as the two saints and Rocco doesn't miss a beat as...Rocco.

1435159,4,B00005IC54,"I saw this movie recently without knowing much about it, besides lots of reccomendations from fellow movie geeks. I was more or less expecting a Tarantino-esque crime movie with some wierdass characters and lots of cursing, which is more or less what I got. I love some good madcap action, and there is plenty of that, from Sean Flannery uprooting a toilet and then jumping off a roof to Norman Reedus pulling wine bottles from behind him and smashing them on the head of an assailant. This is entertaining on its own merits, and would have been even better had the two brothers been fleshed out a bit more as characters. They are introduced fairly sketchily as charismatic drinking buddies, carefree yet dedicated, one half townie jokers and one half able fighters and hitmen. A pretty common idea in the movies, that could've been taken a lot farther.

Willem Dafoe makes up for this however, by turning in a completely surprising show-stealing performance as a gay FBI agent. While the brothers handle the action and posturing, Dafoe provides exactly the sort of masterful character acting that makes this genre of film. Sam Jackson (well, the whole cast in actuality) did the same in Pulp Fiction, Sam Rockwell did it in Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, Joe Pesci did it in Goodfellas. These vicariously violent movies transcend being simple thrillers by providing addictive performances by actors who seem to effortlessly embody their characters.

The other characteristic of this genre is the production, and true to form Troy Duffy uses the camera quite well to make his scenes not just entertaining because of the action but also effective visually. One shot that stuck with me was the hilarious cut to a whimsical overhead shot of Willem Dafoe reclining on a feather bed and fiddling with a purple boa as he theorizes about a crime scene. These little touches make the whole affair decidedly stylized; larger-than-life characters, comic book action, and tricky camera work all come together to produce the genre of stylish, darkly comical crime thrillers.

My biggest complaint is that the plot moves very awkwardly at times. Things seem to happen too fast, drama seems to rise without proper buildup etc. Once the plot is in full gear, the brothers have less and less opportunities to provide interesting dialogue, and ultimately I found myself waiting through uninteresting plot exposition scenes for the next shootout or Willem Dafoe scene. I imagine that the vigilante message of the film was foremost in the filmmakers' minds, which led them to focus on pushing the plot to its final denouement, instead of lingering on character performances and transitional scenes. This isn't a bad notion in and of itself, but it seemed to come off a little rushed. I would've preferred either a longer film with a more fleshed out progression of events, or a more Tarantino/Scorcese-esque approach giving the actors more time to indulge us with their characters peculiarities.

Still a great film however, with a lot of funny moments to keep things from getting too dark. A lot of scenes end with unexpected little gags, and there is plenty of off-kilter goofiness in the middle of otherwise gruesome and serious scenes, like Rocco groping the passed-out stripper after blowing away a mafia underboss.

  A sneaky FBI agent, Paul Smecker played by William Dafoe, is always just one step behind the vigilante brothers.  His quirky investigative tactics leaves the audience guessing what he will try next.

  Even though this movie omits the regular car chases, sex scenes and explosions that are all too commonly found in most action movies, it keeps you on the end of your seat with numerous fight scenes.  While the movie is both graphic and far fetched at times, it is a great film and I recommend any one who hasn't seen it to check it out.",1150761600,,817,4.496598639455782

As with any other unrated director's cut, it does not mean every deleted scene has been added back, and it never did.  All that it means is that the scenes that the director cut to earn the R rating were put back into the film.  There are almost always more deleted scenes that were never intended for the film, but that decision was made after filming.  These are almost never put back in the film, other than when The Exorcist did this in ""The Version You Never Saw"".  Deleted scenes are NEVER rated by the MPAA because they are never submitted to them, so the fact that this is called unrated is not because of the deleted scenes.  Plenty of DVDs have deleted scenes that are not rated, but the movie is still rated.  I refer you to any DVD that is not an unrated edition but has deleted scenes.  Read the back where it specifically says, ""Bonus features have not been rated"".  They clearly explain this difference on numerous DVDs.",1149206400,,1073,4.461538461538462

(As many know, most commercial releases of movies use dual layer discs, with up to ~9GB capacity, often they use 7-8GB, this actually uses 4.5GB of the 4.7 available.)  So, if you didn't buy the other release, which has the movie presented as widescreen but not anamorphic (ie, designed to play on a 4:3 TV and has a lot of padding), this is the better version, especially since it contains that version on the other side of the movie disc.  The case is metal, which is neat, but it is devoid of any words, except ""The Boondock Saints"" and ""Unrated Special Edition"".

The version of the film in this pack is no different from any other version you can already buy.

The trio is being investigated by a brilliant detective,Willem Dafoe, who is gradually learning that these brothers ideas may not be that terrible.

The characters and the style of film is superb, because it covers great action scenes and lots of laughs through dark comedy. You may even find yourself sympathizing with these modern day super heros- and the cat is so cute :-)",1148601600,2,702,4.745901639344262

The movie has got one of the most violent plots to mix in with wild sequences that you'd see in Quentin Tarantino's, Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction which was mixed and shaken just right.  Take the sequences and give it a twist with some good humor...Bill Conolly did a great job, which deserved the Unrated Special Edition.  Two brothers go on a mission from God to do his work and punish the evil by doing it in a way that the devil would admire more than God.  They will go as far as they need to go to stop the evil in the world not by just telling them to stop, but by saying a prayer before death...Death by a bullet in the head, one from each of them (Sean Patrick Flannery & Norman Reedus).  Alongside their killings is an FBI Agent (Willem Dafoe) who learns their ways and, later, thinks that what they do is quite necessary and seeks out advice from a priest in a confessional booth because he thinks he should join them.  The Boondock Saints is a movie tradition that will continue on, whether or not another movie is made or not.  The Boondock Saints is a movie that should've been more recognized for being bold...Extremely good at being bold.  Fans will cherish the Unrated Special Edition.

This movie is superb.  Re: Spenard's review, this is a violent movie.  Obviously, if you don't like violent movies, you won't like this movie.  This was the first movie I watched 2 days in a row.  It has good action, violence and humor, it will keep you on the edge or your seat for the next scene.

This movie is for red blooded Americans, not for bleeding hearted unAmericans.  For Spenard to make a reference to this plot being related to terrorism if you look at it from a different perspective, proves he is an idiot.  There is such a thing as right & wrong, and good & evil.  Of course the fanatics THINK they are right, but that doesn't change reality.  Otherwise you could think and do whatever you wanted to, and it would be justified, because you thought you were right.  I'm sure groups like NAMBLA (north american man boy love association) think they are right about what they're trying to do.

1435235,4,B00005IC54,"First off, I love this movie.  That said, the movie is not perfect, but what movie is?  I love this movie, in part, because of the conflict it seems to drag up.  Is vigilanteism to be allowed?  Is apathy to the suffering of others tolerable?  In an ideal world I would be a pacifist, but I am a realist and I realize that our world is far from ideal.  Since we are living in a violent world, sometimes, even the most gentle of us, are going to wish violence on someone (please note that I said ""wish"" & did not, in fact, say ""do"" there is a difference between thinking and doing, if you don't know the difference you should probably talk with a therapist).

Secondly, I love this movie because it is a MOVIE.  This isn't real, people.  This is cartoon/comic book violence at its dark and witty best.  No one will ever convince me that fictional violence causes real violence.  If anything, fiction is an effective and safe outlet for the very real fears and uncertainties that cause real violence.  Here we have a means of exorcising our inner demons without hurting anyone!

Third, and finally, I love this movie because it makes me laugh.  Seriously, this is a funny movie.

So, if you are not living in denial about having dark impulses lurking in your id, and you can grasp the concept that portaying something in a movie doesn't make it real, then watch this, I think you might like it.",1148342400,3,1391,4.421259842519685

Also, the CONSTANT flashbacks are annoying at times. What I do like are the 2 lead characters sent on a ""mission from God"" to kill. The dialogue is also entertaining even if writer/director Troy Duffy jumped on the Pulp Fiction (aka anything goes) bandwagon at the time. Willem Dafoe is a riot as a gay FBI agent and Billy C is great as a crazy hit man. The movie has developed quit a cult status and I say good for Boondock Saints. It's far from perfect, but is worth a look. Also worth a look is the documentary called Overnight, which shows how loudmouth director Troy Duffy got himself blacklisted from Hollywood after Saints wrapped production. I don't think Harvey Weinstein has Duffy's phone number on speed dial anymore....",1148256000,3,873,4.49685534591195

They spout the usual rhetoric: ""Who are they to judge who lives and dies"". The movie itself is a counter argument to that, which says: ""Who are you to stand by while innocents die around you?""

Still, watching what is an amazing movie does not condone one or the other. The way it's shot makes it very easy to get into, and excited about (The brothers getting ready for action, switching to Dafoe analysing the scene and giving comments, then seeing the action unfold).

Also, Dafoe gives a great and varied performance about a eccentric genius detective.

If you enjoy a well shot movie with a bit of a skewed slant on religion thrown in, you'll love it. If you're the sort of person who'd rather not make waves, deplores open violence but gladly backstabs friends and co-workers, and generally thinks they are better than others, you might not enjoy this movie so much. In fact you might not enjoy anything that does not involve demeaning others much at all.

But to all those who do not fit this category, please, do yourself a favour, watch the movie (especially the deleted scene involving mothers drunken phone call) and enjoy what is a cult classic movie.",1148256000,11,1346,4.638655462184874

The movie itself is far from perfect, but it doesn't take itself too seriously, which certainly makes it go easier on those who would otherwise bash it for its b-movie qualities.

On another note, a reviewer here seems to have focused on the ""retribution"" meted by the main characters as being the gist of the story. I beg to differ, however, as it would seem to me that the subtext points a finger at the indifference which plagues our society and how the very system is rotting from foundation to seams. Sure, for action movie purposes, the film makers went with the extreme of taking justice into one's own hands, but there's more to the movie than just ""an eye for an eye"". One might even argue that the ""saints"" come out to be the replacement for our current, corrupt law enforcement officials. A new institution replacing another that has become obsolete.

At first glance, Boondock Saints is just another inner-city shoot-em-up movie, but at closer look it's a supernatural tale.

The McManus brothers are supposedly Irish, and speak with heavy brogues, but they curiously speak many languages (Russian, French, Irish, and of course, English.)  Nothing about their background is said.  Their father is a man of almost superhuman killing ability who is known in prison only by a prisoner number.  Except in a gunfight with their father, they are virtually unscathed in their battles.  They are extremely religious and proclaim to be on a mission from the Almighty.  People in their neighborhood call them ""angels,"" an obvious allusion as to who they really are or what they are supposed to be.  Though willing to kill without giving it a second thought, the brothers are endearing and likeable.  It is clear that they are the ""good guys"" despite their bloodlust (directed at ""evil"" men.)

The movie is in the vain of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, in that you see the end result of a scene before you see it play out.  The humor is dark and raucous.  The characters are over-the-top.  Willem Dafoe's homosexual, opera-loving, crime-solving genius FBI agent is the most intriguing of the characters.

If you like the kind of lighthearted way in which violence and death are treated in movies like Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs or Snatch, you'll not be bothered by the almost cartoonish violence of this movie.  The story is beyond believable.  It is pure pulp, a tale fit for a comic book series.  But it is entertaining.  Just don't watch it with young children.",1145145600,,1775,4.9391891891891895

  While the film does have a bit of gratuitous violence from time to time, it has a good message: any person can change the world (For good or bad albeit)  The credits at the end of the movie are an accurate representation of how this movie may be recieved.

1435302,1,B00005IC54,"If you've been to college in the past six years you've seen this. It's like a magnet for pseudo-intellectuals and the inebriated. For those who haven't, I'll save you two hours: Two really really ridiculously Irish Catholic brothers (visible from their oversized crosses, tattoos, and alcohol tolerance) go on a rampage, killing Russians, Italians, and Ron Jeremy, because their favorite pub was shut down. And Willem DeFoe is a cross-dressing homosexual FBI agent who doesn't serve much purpose, despite being the only interesting character. There's some half-to-full-baked politics on display: something about ""eye for an eye"" or ""the guilty must be punished"" that just serves as an excuse for people shooting at each other in slow motion.

And did I mention it was gay? There's an uncanny connection in cinema between violent, right-wing rhetoric and homoeroticism. And I'm not just talking about DeFoe; the MacIrish brothers show no interest in women, obsession with phallic objects (guns), and a signature execution style that gives new meaning to ""money shot"" (they also pray when they do this, 'cause they're just so frickin' Irish). There's also a scene where (I'm assuming) God or  Heaven or Michael Collins is commanding them with thunder to go kill lots of bad people and they are both shirtless and sporting O faces not seen outside of porn. And before this, they're meat-packers.

Of course, some people like that sort of thing (look at Schwarzenegger's career). You might like it if ""Full Metal Jacket"" made you want to join the Marine Corps.",1144627200,24,1556,5.118110236220472

I think it's great that we leave this movie questioning our own moral beliefs, no matter where we stand.

In one way, one can argue that they had the command of their God and so their action is justified in a sense. For the rest of us, who do not share their faith or morals, the themes are troubling.

Despite the killings, I liked the brothers. They display a sensitivity that is not seen in the macho alpha males in other films.

For example, at the scene of the public execution of the mob boss,

""Murphy: Do not kill. Do not rape. Do not steal. These are principles which every man of every faith can embrace.

Connor: These are not polite suggestions, these are codes of behavior, and those of you that ignore them will pay the dearest cost.

Murphy: There are varying degrees of evil. We urge you lesser forms of filth, not to push the bounds and cross over, in to true corruption, into our domain.""

I applaud their recognition that their domain is of true corruption and that there is contradiction between what they preach and how they act. This self-recognition makes them a shade more subtle than punks. Where they morally stand is completely open to debate.",1144540800,,1508,4.58364312267658

This movie deals in shades of red and gray... like a Tarantino movie, the gore is over the top - the ethical strokes are also painted with a HUGE brush... but that just makes it easier to talk about (Inductive vs. Deductive).  This movie was great as entertainment, but the moral issues it addresses were phenomonal - and I loved the bit about Il Duce!!

If you don't know much about this movie - go get it and watch, without the Cliff's Notes to ruin the punch lines for you.  If during the middle, you find you don't like it... stop the movie and give it to a more adventurous friend :)  Either way.. you can't go wrong.

The story is about two Irish lads who kill some Russian mobsters in self-defense. They then hear the words of God in a dream telling them to become vigilantes.  And they go on to kill lots of mobsters, mixing the killings with prayer and religious ritual.

It is also a very violent movie as well, but it is not gratutious violence; it is most definitely violent for a purpose, and for that reason, it did not seem offensive to me.  The brothers did not originally go out looking to become heroes, but in an act of self-defense, discovered that their mission was to do what they could to rid the world, at least their world, of evil men.  And they do it with great aplomb, to say the least.  The performances turned in by the actors was wonderful, with Willem Dafoe giving a brilliant turn as a homosexual FBI agent whose sympathies lie with the brothers' vigilantism, and whose ability to read a crime scene was nothing less than astounding.  It was a movie that was by turns violent, funny, touching, and sad, but never for a moment was it dull.

Tracked by a rather bizarre FBI agent (Defoe) they hook up with their Italian friend (Rocco) and create havoc.  Before the end, the FBI agent struggles with the conflict of his job to stop them and the fact that are ridding society of 'scum'.

This movie really does have the feel of Tarentino films, especially Pulp Fiction.  But is it as good?  I'd say not.  While there are some interesting and sometime shocking (ref the exploding cat and Defoe's lip-lock with the Russian thug) moments, this does not maintain the level of interest that Pulp Fiction does.  Rocco's character was a distraction to the brothers as well as the audience.  I found that the endless stream of f*** became tedious, disingenuous and tiring.  Without Defoe's excellent performance, this movie would have really dragged.

Also, the preachy ending was a bit of a letdown to me.  It was out of step with the mask-wearing brothers from earlier in the movie.  And were the TV interviews at the end an attempt to claim that this movie was a serious look at the issue of vigilantism?  I don't know.

Two Catholic brothers become cult heroes after they kill Russian mafia hoods in self defense; they feel now they are on a mission from God to rid Boston of all the lowlife, and do so quite violently, with no real ""list"" to go by; just the nasties.  Sean Patrick Flannery and Norman Reedus give energetic, fine tuned performances as the brother; David Del Rocco as their buddy Rocco (he used his real name since Duffy wrote the part for him) is a little over the top but one can't deny his commitment to the role.  But it's the versatile Willem Dafoe who carries the picture with his role as the flamboyant and openly homosexual FBI agent Smecker.  Smecker listens to opera while investigating crime scenes; he goes to gay bars; he is manic, obsessive, but obviously brilliant.  His scenes are electrically charged and dynamic.  While vigilante justice is a matter of opinion, one does find they are almost cheering these guys on in their quest for retribution when the system fails.

My only qualm is that one the first assassination is very unbelievable.  The movie compensates for this by providing the audience with an excellent moral dilemma, albeit this done without a hint of subtleness.  At one point the 2 brothers and their Italian friend discuss the moral correctness of vigilante murder as long as the victims are criminals and societal undesirables such as mafiosoes, drug dealers,  or pretty much any moral degenerate.

""Did you see Boondock Saints yet?""  A month later, ""Have you seen the movie?""  One night my wife and I were over his house and he said, ""That's it, you're sitting down and watching this movie right now.""

As soon as it was over, we started it right up again.  The next day I was at Best Buy looking under 'B' in the DVD aisle.  Then I proceeded to become a clone of my father.  ""Have you seen Boondock Saints?""  ""You have to see this movie.""  ""Have you seen it yet?  I'd lend you my copy, but I may watch it again tonight.""

The movie starts off with two brothers from South Boston who are about to have their favorite watering hole taken over by the Russian mob.  No faster way to tick off an Irishman than to close his favorite pub down on him.  A fight ensues in the bar with the Russians and pretty soon the twins find themselves vigilantes with a higher purpose.

Willem Dafoe is fantastic, or should I say fabulous, as Paul Smecker, a gay FBI agent who begins to question his own beliefs and morals while tracking the brothers.  Billy Connolly plays the ruthless hit man to a T.  And David Della Rocco does a nice job as the McManus brothers' pseudo-gangster drinking buddy.  He has some of the best line in the flick.

This movie is overtly violent, extremely vulgar, somewhat offensive, and just plain fun to watch.

1435429,4,B00005IC54,"First off, I really enjoyed this movie. It's fun, well paced, and generally kickass. For those factors alone, it makes for a really great action movie that I would certainly watch more than once. I laughed out loud out of sheer pleasure from seeing Willem Dafoe just go completely over the top (as is usually his job). Flanery and Reedus work together supremely well as fraternal twins, and the affection between them is one of the best elements of the film.

There are problems, however. Duffy very obviously makes an effort to make the movie raise political questions, mostly about killing in the name of god. I give a lot of credit to him for not taking sides per se, though he does throughout the film follow the brothers as being on the right path. Yet the issue is extremely large for a fun action movie to be taking on, and that does show on screen. One gets the sense that Duffy has bitten off more than he can chew on that particular issue. For this reason, I like the set up of the movie much more than I did the follow-through. If you're looking for a deep analysis of the brothers' mindsets,  you won't find it here. But as I said before, as a generally kickass movie with a great look and attitude, it definitely fits the bill.",1133827200,,1240,4.4104803493449785
1435430,2,B00005IC54,"I really hated this movie and that's why I gave it more than one star. The second star is for actually making me feel strongly about it and just in case the movie was intentionally made to offend one's wits. I'll explain...

Where do I begin. I guess I start with the plot. The idea of two supposedly religious Catholics with no morals themselves going on a killing spree in the name of God is completely unbelievable. If something like this happened in real life, it would take someone who is incredibly stupid or incredibly ill. This movie has no suspension of disbelief. The characters were hypocrites and worse than the people they were executing. I found the plot ludicrous as a non-religious person and found it insulting to Christianity. Anybody that knows anything about the Bible would consider this movie an abomination.

The characters were dull, childish, idiotic, one dimensional meatheads and their dialogue mostly consisted of unnecessary bickering full of over the top swearing. The rest of the dialogue sounded like it was written by a ten year old who's watched a few episodes of NYPD Blue. The over-acting was embarrassingly dramatic at times.

There were a few genuinely funny moments, but most of the humor was so low brow I just shook my head. The writers were trying too hard to be politically incorrect, but yet copped out by making a point to insult ALL ethnic groups equally in the forced racist dialogue. Their strategy, which was to stoop to the lowest level for laughs, was obvious to me and a sure sign of someone who isn't actually funny but tries to compensate by using cheap, offensive material.

I don't know who made this movie or what kind of point they were trying to make, but there were too many things that didn't make sense. Killing people for beating off at a strip club doesn't make sense. One of the people in the movie also mentions killing drug dealers... the bible doesn't say that drugs are a sin. Homosexuality, on the other hand, is a sin and the forth member of The Saints (Willen Dafoe) is a homosexual.

I just can't enjoy a poorly made flick about a gang of stupid religious hypocrite vigilantes. I found it insulting to my intelligence and I wondered what the point was. I wondered if the director was a Catholic trying to make Catholicism seem cool. I wondered what was up with all the Irish/Italian crap. I felt like the director was almost making a subtle Irish vs. Italians film. Is the director Irish and does he have a problem with Italians? I just kept thinking ""what's the point?"" and ""how long can they drag this out"".

I can't understand why people like this movie so much. The hero's killings are unjust and I just couldn't get into it. They're not good, not evil, just dumb.

BUT

I also wondered if the film makers wanted to make a movie that was so preposterous and unbelievable that it's actually making a case AGAINST the supposed cause of the protagonists. In other words, they paint such a painfully repulsive portrait of the hypocrisy of vigilantism that they're truly making a Christian argument about not ""casting the first stone"" and ""turning the other cheek"".

At the end when they're showing the ""man on the street"" news clips, perhaps they're trying to show how stupid people are... how people will praise ""The Saints"" even though they probably shouldn't. If you read the reviews on this site, they go right along with the sound bites during the credits. IF THAT IS THE CASE, THE MOVIE IS BRILLIANT. That's why I give the movie two stars rather than one... ya know, just in case. But I still think it's unlikely since the main characters are portrayed as being these super cool alpha males... a combination of the Blues Brothers and Jay and Silent Bob.

Regardless, it made me feel strongly and I guess that makes it worth something.",1133740800,8,3813,4.669150521609538

A lot of the criticisms directed at Boondock Saints are completely valid - senselessly violent, awkward dialogue, plot holes abound, overacting - but I think these are aspects of the film that strangely make it, well, good.

For one, it's hysterically funny in a really dark way. The scene with Rocco and the cat comes to mind. For another, despite some of the not so great dialogue, there's some brilliant dialogue, too. Dafoe is absolutely amazing. And while the whole gay subplot seems to come out of nowhere, it completely enriches his character and just adds to the hilarity of the film. I also thoroughly enjoyed Flannery and Reedus as the two Irish brothers who go from mere self-defense to slightly insane vigilantism. Somehow when it's them, I just believe it and root for them even though I completely disagree with their bloodthirsty approach to justice.

Don't expect Shakespeare or even Tarantino, though elements of Resevoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction are there (perhaps more so in violence than anything else). But there are some really amazing movie moments here. Just hang up your prejudices, maybe a few of your ethics, and very likely anything you ever believed about ethnic and religious stereotypes and just enjoy the movie for what it is - a cult classic.

One of the things which made it more real to me than most ""vigilante movies"" like Death Wish 1-3 and others is that the brothers have to go through incredible amounts of pain and suffering to accomplish their purposes. They seem to endure it all willingly. This is what makes them more like saints and less like trained assassins in the movie. They have been called to this life, the decision has been made for them.

The line from the prayer ""power has descended from Thy hand that our feet may swiftly carry out thy command"" is an explanation for some of the more impossible or at least supernatural events and missions which they carry out. I'm thinking about the ""rope scene"" and the earlier ""toilet scene"", also the fact that they receive only superficial wounds from the first encounter with Il Duce. It would seem also that divine providence was also behind the scheduling of Il Duce's release from bondage as well.

I just am happy that I turned it off 45 minutes into it. There are so many bad things in this movie that your head will explode with frustration. Once again, like in Quentin Tarantino movies, I never once found a hero or a character I liked. In this the two heros are irish men who decide to go on a murderous rampage killing everyone they think is evil. Now how are they heros? Why should I like them?????????????????????

At the start, they appear to be strong catholics, but that can't be because I seriously can't see 2 strong catholics going on a murderous rampage killing ""evil people"". If they would be so religious, then they would leave judgement in God's hand not theirs. So that for one is completely idiotic. Secondly, the movie is idiotically unrealistic with these 2 brothers killing like 10 people. Next, there is nonstop idiotic profanity like in Tarantino movies, and I'm sorry but, f this, f that, for no apparent reason is pointless. Also, the 2 brothers are very hard to understand because of their thick accents. But, I didn't even care because all they said was the f word. Then when their friend died, I didn't give a rat's a**! He's just as bad as them. These idiotic heros created now for people to idolize are evil people. But, being the nice guy I am, I skipped to the end only to be even more outraged by what those idiotic brothers did. Quoting bible verses and executing someone in front of children and others. wth? This movie is pure trash and I find it an outrage than anyone like this filth. A movie like this one movie like Pulp Fiction, that is one of the saddest ever. Why? Because our community praises this trash and roots for 2 ""religious"" brothers killing people because they think they're evil. Whoever wrote this must be confused because someone who's actually religious would do nothing like this. And by the end of this movie, I wouldn't have cared at all if the ""heros"" would have died.

Willem Dafoe does a good job as usual but his character is way too werid. Lastly, this movie tries to be funny but it's not, it's idiotic and pointless.",1127433600,8,2261,4.472154963680388
1435470,5,B00005IC54,"Boondock Saints is an odd movie, know that going in.  It has some Tarantino-esque violence and surreal humor.  It switches between gritty realism (the brothers' apartment is painfully realistic, especially the shower) and surreal imagery imbued with a sort of psychopathic Catholic symbolism.  The cast is great, with Willem Dafoe stealing every scene he's in, as a slightly mad, flaming-gay inspector.  Later in the film, he goes undercover in drag, as possibly the strangest hooker ever.  It's also perfectly scored - the music constantly creating the right mood.

The rest of the cast is great, too.  Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus are good as two tough brothers in an Irish neighborhood who inadvertantly find themselves at odds with the local mafia and decide to go on a religious crusade against crime.  David Della Rocco is completely believable as their pitiful wannabe-mafioso friend who provides comic relief throughout the film.  Most of the secondary characters are memorable.  This is a huge bargain at 8 or 9 bucks if you like shoot-em-ups and over the top, bizarre humor.

However, I've noticed that two groups of people seem not to enjoy the movie: people who don't like ""vigilantism"" and folks with certain strong religious ideas.  The movie, as should be clear from the reviews, is about 2 brothers whose warped interpretation of Catholicism turns them into vigilantes.  They are portrayed as the heroes and much of the story is told in a manner sympathetic to their particular, deranged worldview.  So, if you have a visceral opposition to vigilantes or religious imagery you disagree with, don't buy this film.  For me, part of what is interesting about this movie is seeing how the various dysfunctional personalities interact to convince them all that God wants them to go do some very strange things.",1126828800,,1831,5.076923076923077

I recently watched OVERNIGHT, a documentary about Troy Duffy, the director of BOONDOCK SAINTS.  The guy is a talentless wonder who has an extraordinarily big view of himself.  He's also a horses ass of monumental proportions who delights in insulting nearly everyone who crosses his path because clearly no one is as great as he.  Perhaps that's why Harvey Weinstein of Miramax fame destroyed Duffy's career (with a certain amount of joy, I might add) and sent him crawling back to a career of bouncing at a local Boston bar.  So, the moral of the story is: All you aspiring young filmmakers out there should understand that an obnoxiously large ego could be your undoing if you have neither the talent nor the experience to back it up.

1435507,4,B00005IC54,"The Boondock Saints has blindsided me, though not enough to realize its not perfect.

Haven't you ever been sitting around with some friends or family watching the nightly news, grimacing in disgust as low life child molestors or murdering crooks breeze their way through the system, eventually making their way back on to the streets. While you watched, did you have a passing thought or even verbalized what you would do if you could get your hands on the scum? The Boondock Saints carries this out to its fullest. Two brothers lay asleep on a stormy night, when suddenly they recieve a message from God to destroy to evil doers of their city. Thus, the massacre begins.

William Dafoe plays a very confused gay FBI agent, that apparently dislikes gays. He is a massive highlight to Boondock, as he prances around barking orders and slowly spinning towards insanity trying to figure the motivation of the Saints. In this world no one kills bad guys just because they're bad guys, do they? He might like the idea...

The imperfections, according to this reviewer, come in with some massive improbabilities as far as furthering the story. Basically some Deus Ex Machina's and some downright luck. But, hey I guess that could be said about most movies anyway. No one watches Big Fish or Wizard of Oz because its probable.

The most unexpected and hilarious moment come with the execution of a cat, and the response the frustrated Rocco gives to its owners. Almost every scene has a good laugh.

I am a MASSIVE Sean Patrick Flannery fan. I think that with the right material he could quickly be an A-lister. The Critically bashed, Hugely underappreciated, and mis-studied film ""Powder"" is one of my top ten favorites. You can also see him in The Grass Harp. In Saints, alongside Norman Reedus, they wreak havoc on the wicked. They are both perfectly cast and pull off dead-on Irish lib. Billy Connely (The Last Samurai) is a character that would make Hannibal check over his shoulder, but the difference between them is blatant and surprising.

Troy Duffy, with all of his frustrations (as illustrated in a documentary that garnered more screen time than this film) has pulled off something cool and different.

I don't see the Resovior Dogs comparison, which I have watched about a dozen times. I guess the Pulp Fiction comparison comes with some of the violence (Pulp's was off screen almost entirely, if you think about it) or the back-and-forth story form. A comparison to ""Frailty"" would be more accurate, but again, my opinion.

Either way The Boondock Saints is not perfect, but in my adulthood there have been extremely few movies that I have watched repeatedly over a short period of time. In the past few weeks I have watches Saints 3 times, and I await to see what they do with the sequel. Sometimes imperfection's can make something even better.",1120003200,6,2855,4.812244897959184

Two Irish brothers in Boston are attacked by Russian mafia thugs and turn vigilante, killing any and every organized crime scum they can find to make a stand against what they perceive as evil.

Willem Dafoe never ceases to amaze; he's incredible in every movie he's in, and this one is no exception. He plays a flamboyantly gay FBI agent whose expertise is unquestionable but makes him arrogant and rude. He's hysterically funny; the scene where he investigates the crime scene while dancing to an opera song on his walkman is classic.

Norman Reedus and Sean Patrick Flanery also do outstanding jobs in this one. Flanery can also be seen in Suicide Kings, another great movie that also stars Christopher Walken.

Granted, this movie's a little lacking in female character, and the plot is simple, but it's excellently done.

1435510,3,B00005IC54,"As a gay FBI agent investigating a series of mob murders in Boston, Willem Dafoe is enjoying himself immensely. You most certainly will enjoy Dafoe. With only the slightest of swishes and weaving of arms, he probes gruesome crime scenes listening to opera on a headset while at the same time one-upping the local detectives with Sherlockian aplomb. Dafaoe is the best thing about ""The Boondock Saints"" and the only reason to watch it.

We are asked to like a pair of Irish brothers (Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus) who go about cold-bloodedly murdering Russian gangsters because God has told them to abolish evil. But that's not the worst of it. Family and friends, the Church, the media, the FBI agent, all appear to admire their vigilantism and cheer them on, even after they are joined by a mad dog Ialian and a gun-toting senior citizen who really belongs in Quentin Tarentino's ""Reservoir Dogs.""

There's interest in the timely vigilante theme, in the way we are shown the killings only as the agent reconstructs them (and sometimes moves amidst them), in how the gay agent interacts with the macho cops, and in the Church's complicity, but the director has failed to generate it. The editing, with its deadly blackouts, is particularly uneven. Dafoe holds the screen whenever he's on and is a hoot. So, unfortunately, is ""The Boonedock Saints.""",1119657600,,1358,4.9

While ""Boondock Saints"" doesn't fall to their level of incompetence, it does come off much worse due the unbelievable pretentiousness that director Duffy seems to think makes him an artist.

Allot of people mention that they felt it was a pulp fiction knock off and there are definately certain scenes (like the cat getting shot) where you can see its influence but over all i think its stands on its own fine because of agent Smecker (Dafoe).  He has to be one of the most wildly entertaining charecters ive seen in years.  I would have given this movie 5 stars but the religous crap gets annoying and the ending was kinda weak.

For instance, in the final killing in a courtroom, the scriptlines say a mafia-type godfather is about to get off, not because he's innocent (he's guilty), but because he's a CHARISMATIC mafia father, which gives the main characters in the movie a pseudo-intelligent premise to make it's statement.

Two brothers go around taking revenge at criminals, disavowing the justice system, and this movie is doing what?  Does it ask if self-righteous killing is justified without a trial and without a jury?  It never forms an opinion!

Personally, I will confess for the purpose of my article, I'm against capital punishment because I don't think it helps.  So, in a way, the movie actually helps my doctrine.  Most Americans approve of the death penalty by a large margin, but most of them would liberally accept and prefer an alternative when given one that works.  It's not that the film takes sides, because it doesn't; it helps my doctrine because it just shows a lot of blind, self-righteous killing that puts a bad taste in people's mouths.  This movie didn't have much depth of thought, as people who agree with the characters don't have.  The film was passed over for theatrical release.

America is the only country in the civilized world, except for Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Bangladesh, and Barbados, that still has the death penalty.  This movie shows people the opposite by so distastefully investing so much time into defining a reason to prove the killings as self-righteous indignation.  This movie does not coral support for or against.  Instead, the main characters take the law into their own hands, and then the movie leaves viewers to decipher the pieces.

Not too smart of a movie, if you ask me.  Unless, it's trying to scare people into disagreeing with its characters, and it doesn't really do a good enough job.  Willem Dafoe is a good actor, but cannot control the way a film turns out.

The finale has one of the characters rattling off a list of infringements to the ten commandments, including that killing is wrong, and then the guys execute the mafia boss!

Furthermore, when I write a review that puts down something someone else likes, people tend to click the ""no"" button.  Obviously, people only want opinions that agree with theirs.  I'd think people open minded if, when I take the time to state my objection, others would support me!",1102723200,12,2639,4.891891891891892

All the actors do a wonderful job at portraying their characters, the movie has it's serious tones and it's light and funny moments.  Everyone should be able to love the misunderstood ""Funny Man.""

However, this movie is not for the light-hearted, it's has some very gruesome moments that even I had to peek through my fingers at.  And that says a lot, cos I don't get grossed out or disturbed too easily.

But The Boondock Saints was a terrific movie that was well written and greatly acted out.  Many of the parts in this movie have either been done before or are based off something that has been done before (IE The Pulp Fiction-esque out-of-order screenwork), but it worked.  All three actors (Dafoe, Flanery, Reedus) all do tremendous work.  Some of the my favorite scenes were""

""Coming through the ceiling""

""The shootout with El Duche""

""Rocko with his Muush-mush mask""

My only complaints with this film is that sometime the dialogue is hard to understand through the Irish accents and the scene with Willem Dafoe and his classical music forensic scene.  But besides that this film is entertaining from start to finish.

If your a left wing, movie snob who thinks everything Quentin Tarantino has done to be exceptional, (ie. Jackie Brown???) well then, perhaps you might find this movie offensive.  Personally, I lean left myself, however, I found this movie to be extraordinarily well acted, the characters full and interesting and the plot intriguing.  I am as Irish as the day is long, and I was not a bit offended by the plot.  One reviewer deemed the movie ""another black eye for the Irish"" ; absurd observation.

1435608,4,B00005IC54,"Most movies that attempt to survive without much of a plot are utter failures, but because of wonderful characters, great action, wonderful dialogue and solid acting, The Boondock Saints emerges as a very enjoyable film.

A fight at an Irish bar with Russian mafiosos culimates with a double-murder in an alley.  However, instead of prosecuting the shooters the police turn them lose, and instead of villifying the shooters the press condones their actions.  Enamored and emboldened, the two brothers go on a rampage of (supposed) biblical justice, killing those that they deem worthy of the ultimate punishment and sparing the innocent.

As an action movie, this is solid, with good gunplay and camera angles (although I must say that I was dissapointed with a scene in which one of the brothers jumps 50 feet down and lands on a bad guy without harming himself), but the characterization and dialogue make the film soar.  Whether comparing their shoot-outs to those in popular movies to a funny dialogue about the neccessity of a rope, the script really sparkles like something of Tarantino's and keeps the viewer entertained.  In addition, the characters that proliferate the film are always interesting and original, from the flamboyantly homosexual Willem Dafoe as an FBI agent to some of the kingpins they assasinate, and look for porn star Ron Jeremy with a cameo.  7.5/10",1099094400,,1379,5.075221238938053

The story is different than I would have expected but I was not disappointed, I feel the end could have been prolonged a little more but the general ending was good enough.

1435610,4,B00005IC54,"There are movies that when they are initially released are underground successes that suddenly and without warning become iconic when they reach the mainstream audience once they are released on VHS/DVD.  Can Boondock Saints be considered one of these rare films?  Definitely!

The titular Saints are two Irish brothers, Connor and Murphy McManus (Sean Patrick Flannery and Norman Reedus) who find themselves turned from ordinary citizens in their Irish neighborhood in South Boston into vigilante heroes on a self-ordained mission of God to rid their neighborhood of the Russian Mob.

It starts when they get into a fistfight in their local bar and nearly end up getting killed by the mobsters who visited the bar, but instead end up killing the mobsters in the most inventive way imaginable.  However, the duo believe that they are messengers of God's vengeance and go on a violent seek and destroy mission to get the head boss, teaming up with one of their closest friends (David Della Rocco).

Meanwhile, as the body count begins to rise, an FBI agent (Willem Dafoe) with a few eccentricities is assigned to the case and uses his unique way of reconstructing what happened at the crime scenes (which we vividly see in the flashbacks) in such a way that makes the team of CSI look more like grade school rookies.

As the two sides converge on the ultimate climax in the final battle to take down the boss, a third unexpected variable is thrown into the mix when (via flashback)a mysterious gunman with some tie to the Saints (I won't give it away)appears at one ot the crime scenes.

The film is definitely an amazing debut for director Troy Duffy, using actors who really make you feel the story and relationships (especailly Flannery and Reedus) as it progresses to the end and characters that (at times unintentionally) make you laugh out loud.  And there are some scenes that are violent yet stylish and fun and one scene involving a cat and a gun that might stun some and make others bust a gut, and I know from personal experience when I saw this scene for the first time.

There are some rumors that a possible Boondock Saints 2 is in the works, and if so I'm definitely in to see it but hopefully it will be released to a much wider base than the original.  But if you like a little vigilantism with a touch of dark humor, then you definitely have to get the Boondock Saints.",1098662400,29,2386,4.670644391408114
1435631,1,B00005IC54,"This has to be the greatest disappointment I have ever had in watching a film. For over two years, I had heard people going on and on about this movie. I should have looked more closely at these people. These were the kind of people that think How High and Old school are the funniest movies ever put on screen, these are the kind of people whose greatest moment of catharsist from a motion picture came from a Hillary Duff flick. So, I should have relized that Boondock Saints being would be refered to as highly stylized and violent was going to be a wast. This is the kind of trash that gives indie flicks a bad name. You can't even claim that it is highly stylized (putting action seens in slow motion and making very obvious Catholic references into a film does not make it stylized). The fact that William Defoe attached his name to this just wants to make a person go ""What the f#@k.""For a much better Defoe film that got little recognition, go see the biographical Autofocus, about the sorded life of sex-o-holic Bob Crane from Hogan's Heros. ANd to other reviewers, the fact that the movie had no plot is not a legitimate argument, Magnolia didn't have much of a plot but at lest at the end we felt that something was resolved  and we had great acting on the way to entertain us. Lastly, do not dare compare this peace of trash to works of Martin Scorsese or Quentin Tarantino. These two men are probably among the greatest American film makers alive. Their films are not concerned with violence or anarchy. The violence in their movies (with the possible exception of Kill Bill and Gangs of New York, only use violence as a device of telling a story, like a dance sequence in a musical, not the ""story"" in itself. Their films are not about violence but about the hearts and minds of violent people.

1435632,5,B00005IC54,"The Boondock Saints is, in every regard, an unmitigated joy to watch. Practically glowing like some combination of fairy-tale and Bible story the entire film sings like a modern reading of a medieval miracle play. That it overflows with what may, on surface, appear as gratuitous violence only serves to heighten its aspects of religiosity and sense of wonder. That it is deliciously darkly comic ensures that its fun too.

As the MacManus brothers, Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus each bring a winning ""angels with dirty faces"" quality at once immediately endearing and disturbing in its zealousness. I could not help myself from rooting for them early on, wondering about what really led them to this mission of destruction and mayhem.

Willem Dafoe gives one of his finest performances as Smecker, the brilliant, over-the-top, opera-obsessed, gay FBI agent constantly showing off his criminal knowledge as he belittles the local police trying to solve the story's problematic crimes. The slow motion scene of him ""conducting"" through a violent maelstrom of bullets as he dreamily revisits a crime scene is both breathtakingly beautiful and thigh slappingly hilarious. Some have dismissed this character (and Dafoe's performance) as obvious, when it is in all actuality, nothing less than remarkable: a complete tour-de-force by one of the best actors of this ages.

Mixing hyperbole both criminal and religious with its unique brand of literalism, The Boondock Saints seems to confound and confuse as many as it delights. Obviously this is not a film for everyone, but those who look past its psuedo tough veneer and embrace its gentle core violence and vision will be richly rewarded. Hallelujah.

I love the great acting. Maybe its just the irish accents and the irish tongue which they spoke. The irish talk and prayers brought in the element of tradition and folklore which made the movie seem more grander than just two blokes trying to blow other people up.

William Dafoe takes on the role of an FBI agent that is heading the murder cases of these two brothers.  After discovering their identities and their motives he feels they are necessary.  This film stirs up debate about vigilantes and whether or not their actions are justified.

 Even though this film was a ""direct to video"" film, I feel it is one of the best movies to own.  It wasn't released into theaters, apparently because its release date was to close to that of the Columbine shootings.  This didn't really make sense to me because it had nothing in common with it, except for the presence of guns.

1435636,5,B00005IC54,"Boondock Saints is a movie that never got much publicity and did not use much advertising.  The most remarkable thing about this movie is that it never had any advertising at all.  The only way people could hear about it was word of mouth and yet many people heard about it.  It is good to know that movies still need to have some quality and can not just be hyped up with huge budgets and expensive actors.  There were very few known actors in this movie and that is what made it so good.  These actors established themselves in the acting world as great action heroes.

 This movie starts out with the two main characters praying in a church.  The director tries to get you to sympathize with the main characters right off the bat.  It then cuts to a shot of them in a bar drinking with their friends.  A few big men come in and demand that they all leave the bar.  As a result they start a fight with these three men and end up winning because these men were severely out numbered.  It then cuts to a shot of a crime scene and the police are investigating the death of the men that started the fight.  The unique thing about this movie is that it skips parts so that you don't understand what happened, then it cuts back and goes through what happened step by step with the police.  It is the most creative way to make a movie I have seen in a long time.

 Although the movie glorifies killers it is an excellent movie, and should get more credit then it does.  It's an interesting movie and keeps you on the edge of your seat.  You never know what to expect out of these two guys, they are always getting into mischief and always seem to find a very clever way to get out of it.  The fact that they always look back to God for help makes the movie more identifiable with more people that don't really like the killing and action of your typical 90's movie.  Before this movie I was really getting sick and tired of all of the spin off's of Saving Private Ryan.  All of those war movies got real old, real fast and everyone just kept right on making them.  This movie was a change from all that, it stood out from the crowd and made an excellent movie for the times.

 I think the most interesting thing about this movie is, like I said before, the way they showed the action scene.  They would show the very beginning of it and then they would cut to after it and what the aftermath was.  During the aftermath they would cut to parts of the fight scene when what they were talking about was important.  Say they were trying to repair someone's wound, they would then cut to that part in the action sequence where that person was getting that particular injury.  This way you get to guess a little about what happened and then you get the actual cause shown to you in the end to bring everything together.

 To finish up this review I am going to rate this movie on a scale of one to ten with the rest of the action movies that I have seen.  I give Boondock Saints a nine out of ten rating and that is pretty good on my scale, considering I am not really into movies that much.  This movie is a must see for any fan of action movies.  It can also relate with a Quentin Tarantino fan because the plot is very similar to most of his movies.",1097452800,2,3241,4.175806451612903
1435637,5,B00005IC54,"The Boondock Saints is a movie made in 1999.  If you like suspenseful, action movies this movie would be good for you.  The story takes place in the city of Boston in Massachusetts.  Two twin brothers, Connor and Murphy MacManus, played by Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus, set out to rid the city of evil.  The brothers are vigilantes who feel it is there job to get justice for all the murderers, rapists, and mob families in Boston.  As in every good vs. evil story the brothers are being chased by FBI agent Paul Smecker, played by actor Willem Defoe.

Since the brothers believed that they were on a mission from God, they believed they were not doing anything wrong.  They were simply getting rid of all the other sinners in the world.  Being Irish, however, the brothers are very religious and say a prayer over every man they kill to send them to their god.  The prayer is heard in almost every scene in the movie.  ""Shepherds we shall be, for thee my Lord, for thee. Power hath descended forth from Thy hand that our feet may swiftly carry out Thy command.  So we shall flow a river forth to Thee, and teaming with souls shall it ever be.  In Nomine Patrie, Et Fili, Et Spiritu Sancti"".  The Latin at the end of the prayer simply translates to ""In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit"".

I personally thought this was a good movie because it really makes you think.  In a way you agree with the brothers because they are finding justice for those who may never get justice any other way.  On the other hand, you totally disagree with them because while they believe they are doing the right thing, they are killing people and committing the same sins they are fighting against.  I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good thought provoking action movie.

But such is the case with Boondock Saints, the debut film by writer/director Troy Duffy.  I happened upon this movie by mere chance when a friend at work rented it and let me borrow it.  ""Look I know you've never heard of this but just watch it.  For God's sake, watch it.""  So I took it home and watched it.  Called another friend, told him to come over....then I watched it again.  Later I started to search for this on video.  Unfortunately, it wasn't available!  Anyone who had a VHS copy owned a pre-viewed rental copy.  EVENTUALLY it became available on DVD in all its glory.  The commentary by Duffy is hilarious and the optional subtitle can sometimes come in handy during some of the 'more incoherent' Irish dialogues.  The characters are VERY Irish and their accents are thick but I'd have it no other way.

I love how protective some of these reviewers are.  Someone said that he actually hurts inside when someone says they don't like this movie.  Right on.  There are plenty of true fans out there that will always be around to proclaim this film as a masterpiece.  Years from now, future generations will carry the legacy and pass it on to our decendents.

""The Boondock Saints"", (2000), stars Norman Reedus as Murphy McManus, Sean Patrick Flannery as his brother, Connor McManus, and Willem Dafoe as Agent Smecker, the detective on their trail.  David Della Rocco plays himself and was given a co-role in the movie since he was friends with the director.  Billy Connolly from TV's ""Head of the Class"" also makes an appearance in the film as ruthless killer, ""Il Duce"", who draws the line at killing women and children but will not think twice about killing another man.

Boondock Saints, Willem Dafoe, Norman Reedus, Sean Patrick Flannery""The Boondock Saints"" is a film that rose very quickly to cult status, largely because the two main characters of the film are tired of bad guys getting away with murder, (sometimes literally), and decide to take the law into their own hands to ""carry out God's work"".  Many people like to live vicariously through the two main characters, who are Irish brothers who live in Boston.  Also, stealing the show is Willem Dafoe, who is excellent as the flamboyent, gay detective who sets out with the intention to ""get these guys"", and soon realizes to his own surprise that he is largely supportive of their actions.  Smecker is excellent at explaining the crime scenes exactly how they happened and comedically mocks the inferior officers who are painted as less than intelligent.  The film follows the two brothers as they track down some of the city's worst criminals and deal them their own form of vigilante justice.  There's even a cameo in the film by adult film star Ron Jeremy, as the sidekick to a crime boss!  If you're a fan of action films with gun fight scenes, then this is your movie.  Soon, you too will be yelling, ""THERE WAS A FIREFIGHT!""

Talk of a sequel is in the works but if we could akin this film to previous cult movie sequels, this could very well end up being the ""Shock Treatment"" to ""The Boondock Saints'"" ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"".",1097193600,,2050,4.759887005649717
1435662,1,B00005IC54,"I don't really think this is a one-star movie, but I'm forced to give it one star in order to balance out all the people who insult truly great movies by slapping five stars on Boondock Saints and proclaiming it the ""BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!!""  This movie is really deserves two stars.  It's just not quite good enough to recommend.  But what's so annoying is all the people who get caught up in the film's style and think that because it looks pretty that it must be a good movie.  ""Boondock Saints"" has some cool-looking moments, like when Willem Dafoe reinacts a set of murders and acts like he's shooting with his fingers, but that isn't enough to make a movie GOOD.  I wish that cool scenes like that weren't wasted on mediocrity such as this.

The plot... there is no plot.  They kill people, and then Dafoe talks about them killing the people.  Then it happens again.  And again.  Nothing changes.  We expect some sort of twist each time as we witness more and more implausible murders, but there isn't one.

Also, the movie tries way too damn hard.  It pleads desperately with us to think it's cool.  The ""Dutch"" guy appears out of nowhere, and he's made out to be some sort of super-killer, Hannible Lector-esque character but the only thing really said about him was something like ""they only use him when things get really bad.""  What backstory.

Boondock Saints also has more melodrama than a Mexican soap opera.  There are so many shots of sobbing, screaming, moaning, groaning it makes me cringe.  It's not that the characters shouldn't be upset when their best friend dies, or their brother is going to be killed, but it needs to be handled without the almost laughable amount of contorted expression and over-the-top groaning.

And what's the deal with the ending?  I don't want to spoil it, so I won't say any names.  The character that was a badguy and becomes a goodguy... what the hell was going on there?  And you can't tell me that I should listen to the commentary or something like that because the film should stand alone.  The ending just didn't make sense.

This movie is extremely overrated.  And what's so frustrating is that most of the people who like this movie like great movies from Tarantino and Scorsese and others, so they think their taste in movies is excellent, and don't mind forcing everyone they know to endure Boondock Saints, spouting about how wonderful it is the whole time.  Tarantino's and Scorsese's films have substance.  They have fully fleshed out characters that react to one another believably, they have a story that moves forward instead of repeating itself.  They make sense.  So please, if you like Tarantino's or Scorsese's or any of the great crime movies, stop comparing them to Boondock Saints; it brings them down.",1096416000,6,2777,4.715176715176715

1435664,5,B00005IC54,"I first heard about THE BOONDOCK SAINTS from one of my roommates last year. He had the soundtrack of the film (including the speech from the courtroom) downloaded on his computer and was playing it one night when I came into the room. I asked him about the music and then the movie. I became quite interested in the movie and rented it out the first opportunity I had.

THE BOONDOCK SAINTS is reminiscent of the films of Quentin Tarantino, both in violence and in creative, original, and witty dialogue. However, THE BOONDOCK SAINTS is quite different from the films of Tarantino. The movie creates a style almost totally of its own.

Connor (Sean Patrick Flanery) and Murphy MacManus (Norman Reedus) are Irish twin brothers living in poverty in Boston, but enjoying all that life has to offer them. One night while enjoying some brew at their favorite pub, the brothers beat up some unfriendly Russians. Unbeknownst to them, the Russians are part of the Russian mafia. They hunt the brothers down to their decapitated living space, tie one brother to a toilet, and take the other brother outside to shoot him. But the MacManus brothers (like the real life Sullivan brothers from the first half of the 20th century) are inseparable. They are connected by a special bond and surprise the mobsters and end up killing them.

A special detective, Paul Smecker (William Dafoe) is brought in to investigate. After figuring out what happen a bulletin is sent out. Moments later, immediately after leaving the hospital, the brothers turn themselves into the police. It's decided that the act was self defense and they are released. The brothers soon figure out that the deed they did, though unintentional, was good and decide to continue the good work they've begun. Knowing only what they've seen in movies, Connor and Murphy begin a vigilante killing spree, seeking out the filth and scum of the criminal underbelly of the city. They are joined their Russian friend, David Della Rocco, and the scourge begins. Smecker begins tracking the brothers, but as he does, he begins to have a clash of conscience. The brothers are doing what the police should have been doing all along but can't because of political correctness and bureaucracy. Are the brothers really on a mission from God, or are they just devils in disguise?

The acting in the film is excellent. Dafoe is kind of a creepy actor, but he portrays the role of Smecker well. The chemistry between Flanery and Reedus as Connor and Murphy is so lifelike. They make the brothers believable. I don't know much about Reedus, but this is one of the best roles Sean Patrick Flanery has had since he was cast as Young Indiana Jones over ten years ago. The script is well written and tends to avoid cliches. Also, the courtroom speech at the end is one of the better speeches to be heard on film in the past decade.

Not everyone will like THE BOONDOCK SAINTS. There is a lot of violence and cursing. However, the movie doesn't so much have a powerful message, but it does raise some very interesting questions (what is truth and justice, are the brothers really agents of God).

1435668,5,B00005IC54,"The Boondock Saints. The very title made me curious to see what the movie was all about. Basically, the story revolves around two Irish brothers, who after narrowly escaping an attack by Russian gangsters feel that God has granted them the duty to kill the evildoers in the world. They go into their mission with relish and begin taking out mobsters all over Boston with the help of a friend (who looks like Jesus). Willem Defoe plays a gay FBI agent who is trying to track down the brothers, but sympathizes with them, and feels that what they are doing is neccessary. After a series of successful hits, the Mob calls in a mysterious hitman to kill the brothers. The city becomes the battle ground for ""good"" and evil as all the players gather for the final showdown.

One of the best things about this movie is the camera shots. This came out before ""bullet time"" was real big, and the gun fights happen in a way that movies like the Matrix can't match. The violence seems very real, in a Tarantino style. Blood flows often in this film, but its all appropriate to the theme of the movie. I especially like the opening scenes. The song at the beginning ""The Blood of Cu Chulainn"", fits into the movie and sets up the ""Irishness"" that is the heart of this movie. The end credits are cool too showing different people's reactions to the Saints and what they are doing. This is meant to make people think about vigilantees in society and are they appropriate.

Fans of movies like Pulp Fiction and Die Hard will like this movie. The stylized action, endless rambling talk about strange topics, and good comedy thrown in to keep the movie from being too depressing.

1435695,1,B00005IC54,"Set in modern day South Boston, ""Boondock Saints"" is a poorly crafted morality tale about the possible justification of vigilante violence. The movie succeeds only in displaying the writer/director Troy Duffy's ability to blatantly rip off ""Snatch,"" ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels,"" ""Bad Lieutenant,"" ""Dude Where's My Car,"" anything by Quentin Tarantino, and Spike Lee. The success of this film and it's high viewer ratings seem to rely solely on those who have yet to see any of the films mentioned above.

 Without so much as a plot, two Irish Catholic brothers, played by Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus, inexplicably suffer from megalomania and deem themselves divine ""saints"" on a mission from God to rid South Boston of horrendously stereotypical Russian and Italian mafioso. During their efforts to fight crime, the duo somehow manage to befriend an entire South Boston police station, a pointlessly gay, simultaneously brilliant-yet-thickheaded foppish FBI agent (Willem Dafoe), and a slew of other unexplained characters who randomly pop into and out of the film. How Dafoe ended up in this painfully dull and unoriginal flop is beyond explanation.

 The movie painfully blunders between bland ""dialogue"" in which the actor's are unable to maintain their Irish accents to trite action scenes that are later rehashed by Dafoe as filler. Dafoe's sexual self-loathing and inability to keep crime scene evidence from his golden locks aimlessly interrupt in an apparent attempt to distract the viewer from the fact that there is a reason this movie went straight to video.

 In the end, the only thing more frightening than seeing Willem Dafoe in full drag is the fact that writer/director Duffy is working on a sequel to this dollar-bin bomb.",1091750400,21,1761,5.226950354609929
1435696,5,B00005IC54,"for the reviewers who did not like the film, i say thay have no taste in film- or their expectations are too high. the boondock saints is not supposed to be this amazing film, but a quirky snippet of what happens when two brothers go against the russian mob to further adopt a principle of bringing those- who otherwise might not see it- to justice. the concept of taking the law into ones own hands certainly isn't new, but how this is achieved is not through the ultimate bad ass and flashy effects, but through comical, amateurish attempts that make for fun violence.
 the characters are excellent. the brothers may not portray a poignant relationship between siblings, but their spats and love for on another are realistic. the detective? ""there was a fire fight!"" what a performance and i have to say one of the oddest characters i've ever seen in a film and liked. his character alone makes boondock saints worth a look.

The Boondock Saints certainly isn't a normal mobster movie by any means. I like to interpret it as a satire of religion. The first 40 or so minutes of this movie are really outstanding, and then it just sort of collapses. It's not a bad movie, but I heard numerous five star reviews for it from people I've talked to, and that's going a little crazy. There are two Irish mobsters, who believe in the Catholic faith and they go around wrecking people who they feel are a detriment to society in Boston, while believing that they aren't doing anything against the morals of Catholicism. There's a homosexual FBI agent who knows what they're doing and condones it, because he believes it is only benefitting society. In the words of the film, he believes that he is giving the two mobsters a duty as god, so to speak. After a while, when the movie loses its grip, a long-haired Italian guy joins them as an accomplice. The Boondock Saints came out in 2000 and has been established as a popular cult film in this era, like St. Elmo's Fire was in the mid-1980's. It does have a lot of style, and it needed too, with mobsters that young. The only major complaint I have is the language. I hate to sound like a parent (even though I almost was going to be one not too long ago), but the constant barrage of F this and F that and F-ing gets to be annoying.

However, thou shall not kill is the only commandment that they cannot keep. When a sadistic Russian mob starts to force its way into their South Irish Boston neighborhood, they know what they have to do. They set out to rid the streets of every gangster, criminal, and lowlife. In their eyes they are serving God's vengenance. As the bodycount rises, they become local heroes to the world around them. Paul Smecker( Willem Dafoe) is a gay FBI agent who is assigned to the case. While he agrees with the McManus brothers are doing, Paul is forced to do his job. He must now use his extremely unorthodox and brilliant methods of investigation to bring the Mcmanus brothers down.
Before I watched this film, I was very skeptical because the movie came straight to video. However, ""Boondock Saints"" turned out to be one of the best films I have ever seen. If I had to describe the film, I would classify it as a modern day morality tale that is driven by vengenance and determination. The film features an outstanding mix of comedy and intense action. There are moments in the film when you will be laughing your head off. The dialogue in this film is first rate. There are other moments in the film however, where you will be shocked at the countless violence. The shoot out scenes are extremely well done. Perhaps one of the best things about the film, is the creativity that the McManus brothers use for some of their kills. The performances given in this film are suprisingly good!! Sean Patrick Flannery and Norman Reedus are outstanding as the McManus brothers. However, the best performance of the movie hands down goes to Willem Dafoe as Paul Smecker. It is the best performance of his career in my opinion. Watching Paul work is very entertaining. His methods are unorthodox, intelligent, and entertaining!
Overall, ""Boondock Saints"" is a great film.

1435749,5,B00005IC54,"... I watched this movie, with no subtitles, which makes viewing g it difficult because of the thick accents, and found the copy to be hard to view. Throughout all the hindrances I found myself entranced in the movie. I consider my first viewing when I was finally able to purchase the DVD. The film is absolutely fabulous. The plot and characters are well drawn out, but the true grace is in the camera work. Duffy combines the perfect amount of style and flair with a hard and heavy crime action thriller. This movie is entertaining to the last second of the credits. And for a movie to contain lots of action, perfect acting, and wonderful direction is quite rare. The mystery to me was how a movie this great was able to slip past most people, even for one such as myself who tries to keep on top of the movie business rather frequently. ... Duffy was able to get it made with the actors he wanted. ...I love the smaller, less statuesque and more real version of the MacManus brothers. After it was made Boondock Saints was only going to be available in the video stores in VHS. (That's right no box office.) You may ask, then how is it that Boondock Saints has become so popular? I can only guess that it has happened in the rest of the country as it has happened where I am from. I showed it to my friends who in turn showed it to their friends, and within a year the majority of males in my high school (Yes not so popular with the ladies) it went from someone staring blankly at you when you told them about this great movie Boondock Saints, to several people cheering when they noticed you had written ""Veritas"" across your finger in class. This success can be attributed to all of the aspects of the movie, but my favorite part of the movie is the characters. Il Duce and Rocco in particular are so well shot and acted that they are practically cartoonish in appearance. By cartoonish I mean that by seeing Billy Connolly in his black hat, thick sunglasses, big grey beard and cigar, you feel as if he was meant to be dressed as that and play this part. The DVD while blessed with some awesome extended scenes, including the extension of the brothers' confrontation with Rozengurtle Baumgartener, was most greatly bestowed with the trailer. This trailer is testament to the fact that this movie would have rocked the box office, being one of the best trailers I have ever seen (and of which I watch before the movie every time I see it). I, along with many other people with whom I share a love of this film have been anxiously awaiting word of the sequel. I only hope that their current plans to begin production on fall of 2004 continue on schedule without any problems. However it has been proven with the original, the Boondock Saints will overcome any obstacle in its way.",1077840000,7,2787,4.4453125
1435750,5,B00005IC54,"Boondock Saints is a nonstop action/comedy that will keep you glued to the screen! Many of the reviews here haven't talked about the plot too much, and there is a very good reason for it. Talking even a little about the plot starts to give away the story. The gist of it is that two Irish brothers start killing off all of the evil people in Boston because they believe that it was a mission sent to them by God. Yes, it does sound pretty corny, I know that's what I thought when I first heard the plot, but believe me, it's not as strange as it appears to be. This movie was made in such a way that the viewer can think and draw their own conclusions about controversial issues, such as the brothers' ""holy mission"".
Meanwhile, a very gay FBI agent (Dafoe) is following the brothers' murders, while questioning himself about the morality of the brothers. The lines in this movie are very memorable, and very funny. The comedy helps balance the seriousness of the movie, which makes the movie VERY addicting. I watched it for the first time yesterday, but then I just HAD to watch it again. There is a lot of violence in this movie (obviously) and some strong language, but if this doesn't bother you, this movie will quickly become a classic in your home.
The actors Sean Flannery and Norman Reedus, who play the brothers, have such chemistry on camera that it actually seemed like they were brothers. Flannery and Reedus didn't even seem to be acting, they truly seemed to be brothers.
I almost forgot to mention the music! This movie has some of the best music I have ever heard, but unfortunately, the soundtrack was never released. The music really helps to set the different moods in the movie, and it would be severly lacking without the spectacular music.
The most important thing about this movie (in my opinion) is what format to buy it on. Buy the DVD, it has the greatest deleted scenes, (the mother's call one is especially funny) and you do need one of the deleted scenes to explain part of the movie better. The music on the main menu is awesome, and I believe that is the only time that the song plays in the movie.
Believe me, this movie isn't a cult classic for nothing. It's worth every penny of the price, which isn't too much for a DVD, and you will love it! Watching the movie made me want to buy the merchandise and make the website my homepage. I can't explain it, but there's something about this movie that I love. Honestly, I'm not really into these kinds of movies, but this one was different. It's worth every penny.",1077321600,4,2545,4.463519313304721

1435753,5,B00005IC54,"It only takes a few minutes to draw a comparison between Troy Duffy's ""The Boondock Saints"" and almost any Quentin Tarentino film. As I watched this breathtaking movie, I snickered to myself over realizing this little fact. I figured few others would make the connection. Boy, was I wrong! It seems that anyone who has seen ""Boondock Saints"" immediately thinks of ""Pulp Fiction"" or ""Reservoir Dogs."" Moreover, a lot of people do not like the idea of Duffy ripping off such a noble American icon. Perhaps they have forgotten that Tarentino has based his entire career on borrowing or outright ripping off ideas from 1960s and 1970s cinema. I could care less whether Duffy imitated ""Pulp Fiction"" or whether he arrived at this idea on his own. Hollywood routinely begs, borrows, and steals in an effort to make a buck. The recent trend of remaking older films is only one aspect of this philosophy, so complaining about some filmmaker copying a specific style is a moot point. ""The Boondock Saints"" is an enormously entertaining way to spend a couple of hours and, despite a few flaws, may attain a cult status rivaling anything made by Quentin Tarentino. This is how it should be.
Connor and Murphy MacManus (Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus respectively) are two Irish brothers who spend their days drinking at the local pub and working in a local meatpacking plant. They don't do much with their free time outside of lounging around their filthy loft and hanging around with unbalanced people like their friend David Rocco, a minor criminal who longs to join the local branch of the mafia. Trouble rears its ugly head when some Russian gangsters move into the neighborhood and threaten to close down the neighborhood bar. After a fistfight leads to a couple of killings in an alley, the boys realize they may be in a spot of trouble with local law enforcement. Actually, they are in more trouble than they realize at first when an FBI agent by the name of Paul Smecker arrives on the scene. The inept local cops stand around throwing out all sorts of weird, implausible theories about these corpses in the alleyway, but Smecker moves in and figures it all out in an enormously hilarious and ingenious way. By slapping on some headphones pumping out classical music and prancing around the scene checking things out, Smecker tells the cops what happened, when it happened, and who probably did it. Sure enough, the MacManus boys sheepishly arrive at the local cop shop, bloodied and bandaged from their tussle with the Russkies, and confess to the crime.
Fortunately for Connor and Murphy, Agent Smecker takes a real shine to these gregarious youngsters and releases them from jail. After all, the whole incident was merely a case of self-defense gone horribly bloody. But something strange happens to the MacManus brothers after this incident; they suddenly think they receive a calling from God to rid the streets of criminals. Checking in at the local armory of the Irish Republican Army (this is Boston, after all) and arming themselves to the teeth, Connor and Murphy use information gleaned from their encounter with the low-level mafia goons to stage a mission against the bosses of the Russian Mob. Other jobs soon follow, all apparently sanctioned and sanctified by the Almighty. The boys are so successful they soon draw in the assistance of David Rocco, who, with his vast knowledge of Boston's underworld, provides a list of criminals who deserve to die. As the body count rises, Smecker comes closer to learning the identities of these homegrown vigilantes. The fact that the FBI agent undergoes a crisis of conscience over the crimes--he quickly realizes these murders are the work of citizens fed up with crime--leads him to secretly help the men responsible for the killings. Throw in a bunch of Mafia thugs, adult film star Ron Jeremy as a doomed hoodlum, a vicious, mystical killer named ""Il Duce"" (played by Billy Connolly, still atoning for ""Head of the Class""), stylish gunplay, and an exploding cat and you have all the makings of this marvelous movie.
""The Boondock Saints"" is a film about vigilantism and whether that activity is ever justifiable, although that theme seems to disappear for most of the movie. The conclusion, too, ends up being just a little too implausible, but getting there is a boatload of fun. The best things about Duffy's film are the whipsaw quick dialogue, the hilarious running gags, and Willem Dafoe as Agent Paul Smecker. Dafoe especially deserves accolades for his portrayal of a conflicted FBI agent whose sympathies eventually turn to the MacManus brothers. His way of solving crimes, especially the shootout between Il Duce and the two vigilantes, is not only brilliantly executed but a wonder to watch. Moreover, Smecker's interactions with the local Irish cops provide endless opportunities for great dialogue and hilarious jokes.
Regrettably, a bit of overacting at certain points of the film quickly annoys, as does the failure to provide anything more than lip service to vigilantism and how it pertains to our ultra violent world, but ""The Boondock Saints"" is so much fun despite these flaws that you will hardly notice them. The DVD includes many extras, such as important deleted scenes, a commentary by Troy Duffy, and a widescreen presentation. There's even talk of an impending sequel, although the absence of the Willem Dafoe character, if the reports are true, could cause significant problems. There is not any other way to say it: if you have not seen ""The Boondock Saints,"" run, do not walk, to the local video store and buy or rent a copy today.",1074297600,184,5625,4.928345626975764

But it turned out to be one of the funniest movies ever!!  I admit, there's not that much plot to it, but the comedy and the way the story is written makes up for it.  The McManus twins have never killed before, so the first time that they set out to kill people, they do it just like the movies, and it's really funny.  Willem Dafoe is also great in the movie, after seeing him in it, my opinion of him went up.  Overall its a great movie, it has like one of the best scripts ever.  I think that if you like comedies, then you should really like this movie.  It does have some sad moments in it to, but its still good.",1073952000,,827,3.880952380952381
1435776,5,B00005IC54,"Especially to a movie that was never in theaters since it came out too close to the Columbine shootings. (Honestly which was ridiculous.)
Moving on, my review of the movie of course is as biased as the rest. I loved it from beginning to end. It's hard to describe (in a worthwhile way) unless you see it yourself. The plot was told to me by a cousin and I really didn't want to watch it, but not even half the way through the movie I was in love with it, and bought my own copy days later.
The movie itself: Two fraternal twin brothers; Connor and Murphy MacManus who somehow speak 5 languages yet work in a meat packing plant get into a barfight one night, the same men bust down their door the next morning with the intent to kill Murphy outside (who really has the 'younger' brother mentality) while Connor (obviously he's the 'older' twin) is helplessly chained inside.
They -both- incidentally save each other from that predicament and later get 'baptized' and realize their calling in life is to ""Destroy all that which is evil..."", ""So all that is good may flourish."".
The chemistry was amazing, with the brothers most of all. Arguably the bond Connor and Murphy shared is what made the movie stick.
The movie should really be watched, anyone's reviews/comments be damned. Much, much more good has been said about it than bad and has developed a HUGE cult/word of mouth/etc. following by only coming out on video DVD and only publicly advertised when done so.
You really should at one point check out the Special Features of the DVD, they will tell you a lot. Especially the 'Ma calls form Ireland' Deleted Scene. It tells you about how their father left, how the brothers are actually fraternal twins and some other facts, amusing and not.
Troy Duffy's audio commentary helps out a lot. Especially to the smarks with idiotic questions that didn't watch the movie close enough. Heh. ;) He'll tell you the real meanings behind some scenes (Like the ""baptism"") and what his 'vision' was.
It was a low budget movie remember so it's not like everything is perfect and all is explained and pretty like that of Armageddon and Titanic here. ~_^
Overall: Great movie, solid performances, shocking/funny/dramatic all at nearly perfect times. Check it out, really is worth it. Also great for any fan of Willem DaFoe, Norman Reedus or Sean Patrick Flanery.",1073692800,9,2352,4.697336561743342

Almost. First off, Willem Dafoe does a briliant job and I think it even rivaled his performance in The Last Temptation of Christ, but beyond that the flick's got weak written al over it. The story line is jumpy which can be good, but without sharp editing it ceases to have that Pulp anti-flow. The brothers are convincing, but it's little things like leaving out the mom on-the-phone-scene that burns my ass. I mean, that was brilliant! Why in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ Almighty did he have to go and take it out? I do like it more near the end, when I think that amatuer director Duffy finally woke up and realized how to make a movie. Sorry for being so harsh, but it's true.

And right after I got out of class I went and rented it and watched it again and again and again. I honestly don't know what it is about this movie that is so intriguing, but it is. Maybe it's the fact that it's left with such uncertainty of whether or not you should consider the two main characters heroes or not. I think that's what the ending credits are supposed to prove - that the film makers weren't trying to make you think these guys are heroes, but they weren't making them out as villians either. It's up to YOU to decided that.
The movie is just done so beautifully, and it's one of my favorite indies to date. It's definately a great movie. And I think it's obvious that the film wasn't made for any particular sex.

My biggest problem with this film is Willem Dafoe's character.  Overacted, poorly written, downright cheesy dialog.  Apparently he's this genius investigator who becomes so wrapped-up in his cases that he becomes physically exhausted reenacting them while dancing around listenting to classical music.  While super-sharp investigative techniques can work well to make a film interesting (SE7EN,L.A. Confidential, even Minority Report is far better), it completely fails here.  Why?  How is it that it never occurs to this guy to question our two protagonists for the deaths of no less than 9 Russian mob guys, almost immediately after they're released for the murder of two other Russian mob guys?  C'mon, talk about holes in the script...and this is just one example.
There were things I liked about this movie.  I liked the two lead roles, though ultra-streotypical (booze-guzzling, bar-fighting Irish guys).  The soundtrack to the film wasn't really what I was expecting, but it was pretty good.

In order to make the point that the desire for justice leads logically to outrage, which leads logically to viglilantism, the director/writer would need to build an identification between viewer and the 3 main protagonists.  One of these figures--Rocko--is so moronic and out of control that there can be no such identification unless you are moronic and out of control.  The two Irish brothers are supposed to seem deeper, presumably because they speak several foreign languages, but really they are the same sort of hyper-testosterone bar slime they become so enraged at throughout the film.  A film that tries to confront violence/crime without contextualizing it, is racist in terms of its stereotyping of Irish, Italians, and Russians, and also classist (drug addicts deserve wrath and punishment?  How about the corporate crooks and politicians that make drug addicts?) If you have two hours to kill and would like to ponder the moral dilemmas causes by an inadequate justice system, consider reading Shakespeare's Measure for Measure.

The movie is about two Irish brothers, Connor and Murphy played by Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus, who set to rid their world of evil men.

The movie is quite entertaining with a good blend of action and humor. Humor if you are one of the people mentioned above.  It has the cult movie feeling even with a big block of cheesiness at the end.  I was expecting a Willem Dafoe Platoon style character (Elias), and was throw for quite a loop.  It took me a couple seconds to adjust my preconceived notions of his characters but he does an awesome job and proves his worth as an actor.  The best thing is that even though the movie has a star like Dafoe, it isn't a star movie.  It has a raw flavor where the producers seemed to have more fun making the film then worrying about money, glitz and the media machine. On the downside of that there are some inconsistencies and WTH sections. However, if you take it at face value, it is quite enjoyable and worth a spot in a collection.  It can also satisfy all those viewers who ask questions like ""What was in the briefcase in pulp fiction?"" or ""Who is Keyser Soze?"" especially when trying to explain the few inconsistencies and the subtle righteous killing theme. :)",1060214400,,1182,4.345454545454546

They remain one step ahead of the police and Dafoe almost every step of the way. The way that some of the scenes were shot involving the crime scene shootouts was quite original. The meshing of the actual shootout scene with Dafoe's reinactments to the police was brilliantly done. Completely captivating.

Somehow it ended up at the top of my Netflix list and when I pulled it out of the mailbox I figured what the heck.
It was nothing like I had expected. Yes, it's violent. Yes brothers Connor and Murphy (Sean Patrick Flannery and Norman Reedus) are killers. But they're also funny and smart and goofy and (possibly) acting on God's orders. Read the other reviews if you want to know the plot, but it isn't really important. This is a fun movie, if you don't mind a bit of profanity and a lot of blood.

1435961,5,B00005IC54,"My friend told me of the Boondock Saints about 6 months ago. He said it was quick paced, witty and bloody. He also mentioned it was one of the funniest movies he had seen in a while. I had seen the movie at Blockbuster a few times and never rented it, just didn't seem like a movie I would be interested in. Well, as usual there was nothing at the video store worth anything so I picked up the Boondock Saints on DVD, just on the hunch that my friend was right about the movie. I am glad I listened to him.
Boondock started out with one of the funnier moments in cinema history, focusing on the bond between two Irish brothers that worked in a meat packing plant, forced to train a large feminist woman. Of course hi-jinks ensue when one makes a comment about the ""rule of thumb"" to the large woman. A kick to the boys is what he got from his comment, and laughs is what I got from the entire seen. That mood stayed with the rest of movie, a funny undertone combined with some really good action scenes.
The best part? Willem Dafoe playing a gay FBI agent was priceless. His witty comments and slick dress code causes for some pretty good scenes in the movie. Sean Patrick Flanery plays Conner MacManus and Norman Reedus plays Murphy MacMannus, to fraternal twins that are forced into a situation to stand up for themselves against a few members of the Russian mob in Boston. One of the most surprising performances were given by David Dell Rocco who played well.. David Della Rocco also call ""Roc"" or ""Funny Man"" in the film. A virtual unknown actor that has a slapstick face with good exaggeration for certain scenes.
Troy Duffy, the man who wrote and directed this brilliant film was also making his directorial debut with the Boondock Saints. He is good with the camera direction and excellent for mixing a serious undertone along with blunt tasteless comedy. Tasteless comedy just happens to be one of my favorites. Duffy is also in the process of directing Boondock 2: All Saints Day, which I am hoping does this film justice as a sequel, nothing smart about screwing up a sequel as well as ruining the legacy of the first film.
The story is easy to follow and not Oscar caliber, but it is compelling enough and interesting to see the film through. The MacManus brothers rise as vigilantes, swearing to kill any man that is a criminal is a fresh air in the movie industry. All of us that love the vigilante theme were sick of waiting for Death Wish 20,455 to come out. Charles Bronson is just a little too old to be taken seriously as a die hard vigilante. this movie is the Punisher comic book hero combined with the Three Stooges.

The Boondock Saints are a couple of demented Irish boys who dedicate their mind and spirit to the lord and also their anger and account of death as well. The main point to all of their actions is that they feel 'Man' is no longer civilized and the chain of corrupted leaders must all die in order to gain another order or revolution to regain common sense in people. The two guys kill people in the name of christ and before they shoot someone they always chant a prayer side by side together. So far this movie has your goons and your greeds but no action scene in this movie unwravels until (Willem Dafoe) an FBI agent comes in to investigate each of the scenes. I like how the director decided to keep the viewers in suspense waiting for the FBI agent to explain the whole scene to us!

If you like CSI for its investigative talents, you'll love the criminal aspects of this movie.  The twins, later called the ""Saints,"" are both very good at covering their tracks and leaving no evidence behind.  Smecker is better, an FBI agent who knows and loves his work.
This is director Troy Duffy's first movie, and as such sometimes the filmmaking is a little amateur.  However, there are many scenes that are very well done, including tricky camera work that looks frankly awesome, neat special effects for such a low budget, and passion for getting the scene down perfectly.
I may be a little biased, however.  I've met Mr. Duffy and the members of his band (he plays blues-esque rock), and he signed my copy of this movie ""You are my first fans!""  I'm anxiously looking forward to the sequal - Boondock Saints II - All Saints Day.",1052956800,2,1169,4.757425742574258

1436040,4,B00005IC54,"The Boondock Saints (Troy Duffy, 2001)
Boy howdy!
Despite a surfeit of talent and some of the funniest dialogue since Quentin Tarantino picked up a pen, Troy Duffy's feature film debut, The Boondock Saints, went straight to video. Considering the nauseating stuff that comes out of Hollywood these days, it's probably not a surprise-the better something is, the less chance it will ever see a big screen. Case in point: right here. Two Irish brothers (The Dead Zone's Sean Patrick Flannery and Norman Reedus, recently seen in Blade 2) try to prevent the closing down of an Irish bar on St. Patrick's Day by the Russian mafia. Things go wrong, but the right guys wind up dead. While the murder is investigated by the oddest FBI agent you're likely to find on a screen for the past twenty years (Willem Dafoe), the brothers, along with their halfwit sidekick Funnyman (David Della Rocco-whose character has the same given name as the actor) from the Italian mob, decide that vigilantism seems like the right path to be taking with their careers. The boys form the Boondock Saints and start cleaning up the streets, and the more the FBI Agent sees of their work, the more conflicted he gets as to whether he should be catching them or aiding them. The mobs-both Russian and Italian-are not so happy, and so they recruit a stone killer known only as Il Duce (Billy Connolly, who's been in so many good movies he should've been in Hollywood's A-list a decade ago) to take the Saints on.
Sound complicated? It is. It's also miles and miles of fun. Not for the weak of stomach-the dialogue is not the only way in which Duffy's work resembles Tarantino's. Also not for those who sour quickly on profanity. For the rest of us, this is a treat, a movie with speed-of-light pacing, snappy dialogue, lots of things blowing up, and more panache than you can shake a stick at, pal.
Thankfully, The Boondock Saints has hit cult status on video, prodding Duffy to once again take up the pen, hire back all the survivirs from the first film, and start shotting Boondock II: All Saints Day. With any luck, Duffy will get himself a big-screen release and this movie will get the attention it has long deserved from a much wider audience. ...",1049414400,16,2222,4.656488549618321

I have seen this film countless times and keep it next to my DVD player for frequent viewing because it is so good. Just put it in your shopping cart, you will not regret it. I rate this DVD five out of five stars. Grade: A+",1044489600,,766,4.1824324324324325

1436111,1,B00005IC54,"I would only reccomend this movie to those who truly appreciate the worst of the entertainment world.  By the back of the movie one would assume this movie has an extensive plot line, and holds perhaps a message that would be hard to obtain.  This of course would make the movie interesting, and with the cast (especially Defoe,) it should be rather great.  Instead you get a movie with a homowierdual Defoe and a plot line about as complex as a pokemon cartoon. It is also full of horrible oneliners, very choppy scenes, and unrealistic portrayal of law enforcement.  I was very dissapointed, very dissapointed indeed.",1043366400,6,619,4.811320754716981

It was among the best movies I have seen in the past few years.  Then when I found out that it wasn't a major film company, that made it all the better.  I am always more impressed with movies that don't have a big budget and are still good.  Anyway, i've been telling just about everyone here at Lyco to go see it....so far big campus hit.",1042934400,,495,4.178947368421053

I watched it at the behest of my band when I was half asleep and I thought it [was bad], then I watched it while a bit more coherent, and I recognized it for the masterpiece that it is. Thanks to Agent Smecker, I have many comments to make to people who [upset me] in the hallway ... What impresses me, is the way that William Dafoe ceased to be himself, and became Agent Smecker. That is the mark of good acting, I think. You should all watch this movie and pay heed, for one day you will look behind you, and see we three. And on that day, you will rent it.",1042934400,,576,4.017391304347826

The action sequences and plot twists are also first rate.

That, in some odd, almost disturbing way, is how much this movie means to me.  It is truely my absolute all time favorite film, justifiably one of Willem Dafoe's most challenging and diverse roles.  The tale of brother's quest to rid the world of the evils that man can not, on any normal day, bring to justice for their evils, is one of deep and powerful meaning.  The action is superb, and the planning and thoughtful setup of the film from start to finish is indepth and enlightened without being too full of itself.  The Brother Saints, with hands tattooed of Latin ""truth"" and ""justice"", stand out in my mind as two of the greatest motion picture characters spawned since Arnold first said ""I'll be back"", or Mel Gibson first dislocated his shoulder in a motion picture.

1436160,2,B00005IC54,"I finally got to see this little-known movie, and it's really a B movie that has some ""art house"" characteristics.  It has strengths in some of its style, the choice of omission of scenes that were not needed as they fill the picture, and an interesting technique where the mixing of DaFoe's characters interpretations of the murder scene and what actually happened-- but unlike say traditional Quentin Tarantino films which this movie is supposed to emulate, it does not have enough to simply be about style-- and its message is far too simplistic.  I mean the movie simply takes the notion of righteous, heroic vigilantes and elevates them almost to martyrhood.  The problem is there's not much substance to the characters-- even DaFoe's gay investigator comes off disappointing.  And there are elements of the movie that it hardly probes but simply teases, i.e. one racial/ethnic faction against another-- in this case Irish poor against the Russian mafia-- for all the ""heroic"" elevations these characters may seem to get, they are after only one type of villain/mobster creating crime in the streets.  Then there may even be the possibility that this movie is about manhood/machoism-- I mean DaFoe's character brushes off one of his boyfriends because he is too [openly gay]  for him.
The fantasy of the two Irish brothers succeeding in their efforts to off the Russian mobsters goes beyond realistic expectations, yet in spite of the experimental nature of the film, seems to insist we are in the ""real world"" here.  And finally, its ending where the media interviews people off the street to ask their opinion of whether our two Irish brothers are heroes or criminals seems silly, since the movie seemed to make them seem heroes throughout (even DaFoe's character seems to be won over them way too easily).  So this movie finally lacks a conflict, and as strange as it is to see the two Irish brothers make their offing bad guys a religious ritual, unintentionally makes the audience respond negatively in a post September 11 world (Note: Movie was made two years before 9/11).
Two stars for some style, but as for its substance-- we're talking total B-movie territory, maybe even weaker.  There's no story here.  Just episodic ventures of our heroes (and not even anti-heroes) fighting the Russian mob because they've hurt their turf way too often. They may wear black trenchcoats, but they are actually wearing white hats in your typical weak white hats/black hats plot.  Now I finally understand why Sundance, the Independent Film Channel and the regular cable channels did not pick up this movie for so long.  There's not much there.  Two stars because I still see some promising for filming and production for other types of movies.  It at least has some interesting ideas/approaches to film making.",1040428800,7,2811,4.978632478632479

It seems as if the company decided to cut out some of the best gore scenes...

Gay FBI agent Paul Smecker is on their tail, but he doesn't really want to stop them.  The actors in this film are phenominal.  Dafoe, Reedus and Flanery are all amazing, but supporting actors David Della Rocco, Ron Jeremy, and Bob Marley all help to keep the movie interesting.  I recommend this movie to everyone.

Amongst the heaps of watered-down mindless action films and the ""haha this is funny now laugh"" comedies. Saints is a poignant witty film that makes you think with a memorable array of one liners. I found myself in a pub in Philly on a layover drinking with a bunch of strangers, someone mentioned a story about his girlfriends cat and I chimed in ""I killed your cat! I thought it would bring closure to our relationship"" that left everyone cracking up and reciting various other lines in this soon to be cult classic.

It's a shame that this movie got no play in the US. For an indie film from a first time writer/director it's a great movie. It's completely entertaining, which is unfortuately rare. Honest to goodness, ladies...Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus in the same flick, it doesn't get much better than that!...you can tell that they became good friends from making this movie, it's so obvious on screen that it makes them totally believable as brothers.

But- I must admit this movie rocks hard, is totally sweet even. Action scenes had to be rewound so I could view them a second, and third time.

1436228,5,B00005IC54,"The Boondock Saints was honestly the best investment I have ever made on impulse.  Within 10 minutes of having started the movie, I knew I was in for something special, I was excited and on the edge of my seat.  I wish I could claim to have done something for the first time that was this amazing.  For a first script, and a directorial debut on an independent film budget, Troy Duffy started at the sky and worked his way up.  The story itself, revolving around two Irish Bostonian brothers and there ""quest"" to rid the streets of Mafia bosses, druglords, and other street scum is wonderful.  I don't want to go too heavily into the plot, because seeing it unfold before me was part of the pleasure I gained from watching this movie.  This movie is filled with questions to the viewer as to what is morally acceptable, what stereotypes are held in society, and how much we, as humans, WANT to believe in what is going on, and are willing to keep watching wether we agree with it or not.  The acting perfomances are solid across the board.  I was already a big fan of Sean Patrick Flannery for his role as the Young Indiana Jones, and liked Willem Dafoe's work from Platoon and other movies.  Norman Reedus was someone whom I had never heard of, but I am out looking currently to see more of his movies.  The bond between Sean and Norm who play brothers was wonderful, and translated beautifully on screen.  The movie is a wonderful mix of action, comedy, drama, and presents a real ""thinker"" movie that leaves your brain on way after the movie is cold in the player.  I highly recommend this movie to everyone.  Wether you like it or not at the end, its a movie worth seeing to find out.  As for the DVD, as a DVD fan and collector, I have to say I was highly surprised by the extras.  Deleted scenes for wonderful, and as I failed to mention earlier, show scenes differently from the movie.  The movie was magicly directed, the editing was wonderful, big thumbs up to Troy Duffy just for the way he shot this film.  The extra's on the DVD also include a commentary which I highly enjoyed watching and will do again.  This is truly (and one of the very few in my experiences) a MUST SEE movie.  I know the cult fan base is high, and I hope the movie gains more and more ground, because it is truly deserving.

Reservoir dogs and pulp fiction were great movies.  I also enjoyed Snatch and lock stock.  If you like these movies, you should know that boondock saints is nowhere close to what these movies are like.  First off, bad, bad acting.  Willem Dafoe was just terrible.  He has his moments, but most of the movie, he drove me insane.  Sean Patrick Flanery, and Norman Reedus made the movie all right, but still it wasn't anywhere close to good acting.  The plot tries to be like resevoir dogs but falls way short.  It is not smart, and quite predictable.  The soundtrack is decent, but nothing as good as the movies I listed above.  There are some clever scenes, but all in all the movie is just awful.  I didn't like it the first time I watched it.  I tried to watch it a second time just in case I missed something which made the movie good.  I didn't and it was even worse the second time I watched it.

Over the years, I have held multiple showings of this film, and have really only met 4 or 5 people who haven't enjoyed it.  This might be in part due to the folks I'm showing to of course - mostly college age kids, and friends of my brother... - Those who have objected to the film have done so on moral grounds.  Either they feel there is too much violence, or they feel that the film itself does not present a good moral message.
As for the violence, there IS a lot in the film.  And a lot of swearing.  But I feel that the violence definitely plays a role in the film, and isn't exessive.
The moral in the story... well, there really isn't one.  I think the movie is to make you THINK.  It isn't black and white, and that's the point.  Just watch it and you'll see!

The only strength of this film is the outstanding performance of the always-great Willem Dafoe. Still, his part, along with all the other characters, is poorly-written and underdeveloped. Hardly any background info is given. The premise of the story is weak and the movie contains many inconsistancies which are never explained. Why this film became a cult classic escapes me, but it can probably be traced to the excessive violence and low budget that led to comparisons with Reservoir Dogs. The major difference is that Reservoir Dogs had a smart script and an interesting,engaging plot that went somewhere.

1436277,3,B00005IC54,"When I first saw this obscure film by Troy Duffy, it was on VHS from a local store. I thought I was renting a B action flick..I mean, why else would it be straight to video? How wrong I was. This movie is at the top of its genre. Many write it off as a wannabe Tarantino film, but the movie is quite different from Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction, as it has many more comedic elements as well as intelligence and wit.
Willem Dafoe is EXCELLENT in his role, being calm and collected one minute then a raving homosexual lunatic on the other. The film is very well casted, and Ron Jeremy even makes a cameo as Vincenzo. The film was originally picked up by Miramax and budgeted for huge release, but they wanted to cast Stallone instead of Dafoe...Stallone? Troy Duffy took his script elsewhere, and Franchise Pictures gave him more freedom, and I think it was a great descision on Duffy's part. It's just too bad the film never got a wide realease, even though the cult following has become huge worldwide.
I would give this DVD 5 stars, but I cannot. I was very [mad]with this DVD. Two of the most superbly filmed action sequences were cut down in this U.S. version to avoid an NC-17 rating. It truly ruined the film for me. The scene where they drop from the ceiling and dispose of the Russian Mob had slow motion blood trails and bodies getting hit and flying. CUT OUT. The U.S. version looks pathetic, and it looks like they drop from the ceiling and the Russians just fall and die. Then theres the bar scene where Rocco shoots the two henchmen and the barkeep. The original had the guy getting shot in the head, blood spewing, the second guy getting hit in the chest. CUT OUT. The U.S. version shows no blood at all. It's just sad. There are so many other films that are way bloodier but still get a R rating. I was really upset that Boondock was censored for this DVD. It's like listening to a song with a million bleeps in it for censorship...who can be happy with that. The movie is a 5. The DVD is not.
The versions in Europe are uncut, but they are region 2, so you have to have an all-region player to view it in the U.S. There have been talks about an NC-17 version being released, but nothing official. I bought the DVD because I love the movie and wanted the deleted scenes and commentary, but am displeased with the censorship. If you've never seen the uncensored version then you probably won't care, but fans who have seen the uncut version will be very disappointed.",1034899200,4,2481,4.372294372294372

We happen to be lucky enough to live close by the bar where all these guys used to hang out, and ran into ""Rocco"" one night. All we could do was thank him for such a fantastic movie. I also heard pretty reliable scoop that they are making another one! Anyway - It's really a shame that this movie didn't get the marketing it deserved.

The interviews at the end of the movie sum up the mixed feelings that everyone would have, where this really to happen. The cast is just simply marvelous.

This movie takes itself way too seriously to be as inane and unbelievable as it is.  I was looking for a Bonnie & Clyde ending to redeem a little bit of the moral ambiguity, but alas the director didn't even have that much tact.
For much better Irish mob movies, check out Miller's Crossing or State of Grace.",1034121600,7,564,4.519607843137255

It is an utter tragedy that this movie was doomed straight to video after the Columbine Incident.  It deserves much more recognition than it ever got.

if you are looking for a film that really dives into the character..shows all dimensions and the motivational forces behind their actions....keep on moving.  still to this day i have no idea why these people did  the things they did.  these two irish brothers, who were happily working at a meat factory (no indication that they are prone to violence) all of a sudden decide one day basically annihilate everyone that they thought was bad, or basically whoever the catholic church frowned upon.
but i was really willing to let that go...i was willing to forget that end enjoy watching them kill the baddies in cool artsy MTV camera angles.  but no, the director just kept screwing up.  he had to do things like throw in a third character, rocco, who i can only describe as being the equivalent of jar jar binx of episode I...need i say more?  it all went downhill after that, you could tell the director was trying really really hard to make a hip ""win me a sundance film festival award just like pulp fiction"" type of movie...however, he failed miserably...and then the ending, oh wow the ending..that was just about when the sheer absurdity of it all just about gave me an anneurism....alll i could do was laugh.
i would not recommend this film to anyone who is familiar with movies like reservoir dogs, pulp fiction, the professional, lock stock two smoking barrels, and so an and so forth (actually i wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone who doesnt want 2 hours of their life unfairly stolen from them by troy duffy) what i hope you will notice is a movie that pales in comparison to the movies it really really desperately wants to be.  but as much as i would hate to recommend this to anyone, there are people out there who i know will enjoy this 'movie'...i can pretty much guarantee that average 15-16 year old will probably think this is the coolest thing he's ever seen...so grab your copy today you young white male middle class suburbanite!",1033862400,4,2380,4.645238095238096

I won't go into detail about plot ect, as it has been discussed here quite a bit.  But I will say this, that Troy Duffy got royaly ... by the ratings people. If you listen to the comentary you will know that it was being rated as columbine happened, so it nearly got a nc17 rating, they had to cut a lot of violence out, and then it got semi black listed by theaters who were scared of parents reactions to such a violent film so soon after columbine.. thus it was sent straight to video.  Very unfortunate.
To all those who have given this film lesser ratings, I noticed that most of you had watched it before (weeks/months ago) i think you have confused your movies, because the acting, directing and all of that is quite good in this film.

It doesn't provide pat answers, which I felt worked well (We are a civilized society, but how do you best deal with the uncivilized).
In terms of movie enjoyment...gotta say it's also a fun movie while it gives you meaty subject matter to chew on.  I've never seen a movie where a toilet was used as a murder weapon; Ron Jeremy in a non-porn, porn role ( bit of great casting, BTW); and the worlds WORST attempt at cleaning up a crime scene (if you are particularly observant, notice what they used to cover up part of the mess.

But after this very day, nothing is ever the same for the brothers, who is soon-to-be-known-as the saints.

Schmecker follows their bloody tracks, and against his will, Schmecker discovers that he admires the brothers for doing what his job prevents himself from doing; terminating the worst criminals, the creeps FBI can't do anything about.
This is by far the GREATEST movie ever, and even though you might not be that hooked on action you will be after watching BOONDOCK SAINTS; it captures you from the beginning, and you'll want more when this movie sadly ends.

Once it neared the end things started to fall apart.  The plot goes from semi believable to down right rediculous.  I won't give specifics, so as not to ruin the movie, but the cops plot twist is, well, for lack of a better term....dumb.  As for the last 10 min of the movie, all i can imagine is that the writer was out of ideas or heavily medicated.

The complexity of the laws that the modern societies adopted to face the organized crime finally protects the criminals instead of punishing them. In the movie there is no question about what is good and what is bad. Our Heros, two brothers (Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus) know what they do and they don't have any doubts about it.

1436433,4,B00005IC54,"To start, Boondock Saints is blatently inspired by the Tarentino-esque style that has seemed to become popular among the indie crowd lately. The film shows this off most in the way the events are chronicled, mainly, you see the boys enter a room, then you see the investigators enter the same room, now drenched in bodies, THEN you see what actually happened in that time span.
The action sequences themselves are also shown in slow motion- almost Matrix-like with opera substituting the techno.
As for the acting in the film, the two brothers make for a great team, particularly when they keep it cool around their high-strung Italian buddy. Willam Dafoe obviously had great fun playing the agent and it shows.
Overall, I would say that the film is too stylish and tries too hard for it's own good if it wasn't for the fact that the Boondock Saints is still one damn fun action flick.",1026432000,,885,4.67948717948718

1436436,4,B00005IC54,"The Boondock Saints, starring Sean Patrick Flannery (Girl), and Norman Reedus (Gossip) is totally entertaining. The boys play two Irish brothers in Boston who begin to take the law into their own hands when organized crime begins to affect the businesses in their neighborhood, and become local heroes in the process. Willem Dafoe (The Last Temptation of Christ) is excellent as the intriguing homosexual FBI agent investigating the brothers' crime spree. There is also an interesting, if not completely surprising, plot twist at the end.
The film, however, does have its weak points.
The boys' accents are a little more Lucky the Leprechan than true Irish, and sometimes they seem to forget them altogether. The film hints that there may be some divine mysticism at work in one scene, but unfortunately it is never addressed again. Also, for some reason, the film veers away from the brothers for a while to center on the antics of their friend (the ""funny man"") who has joined them in their mission of vigilantism. I believe these quirks could have been avoided had it received Hollywood blockbuster-type funding.
The Boondock Saints does have lots of action, humor, and some thought provoking ideas. Despite its flaws, it is a good, offbeat movie that seems to be gaining a solid fan base through word of mouth.

The end is so dramatically wonderful.  While the plot was skimpy in parts, it was positively so--it left me asking questions I wanted to ask.

The movie felt like it was trying to be smart, like Pulp Fiction, or at the very least, action packed, like a John Woo movie, and utterly failed to be either.  Stank dialogue and ""mysterious"" latin chants were combined into a hash of zero plot punctuated by assassinations of ""Russian Mob"" members that the director has to introduce with little onscreen words saying ""This guy is part of the Russian Mob.  Bad guy.""
I was really hoping for a good movie, but a movie that can't even introduce a villain, or put together a good action scene (the opening sequence is decent, the rest of the movie falls on it's a**) -
The entire thing feels like Episode 1 - you watch little Annakin accidentally bring down the droid army, and it's like, ""what?""
Same feeling, only lower budget.  The DVD can't be worth it if the director couldn't even afford LIGHTS (you'll know what I mean if you see it).
For a better movie (and much, MUCH better action) check out Takeshi Kitano's Fireworks - for a movie that has some kind of ""moral dilemma"" that all these reviewers seem to be infatuated with (even though the so called 'dilemma' is laughably portrayed) you might want to see Black Hawk Down or Clockers.

1436493,1,B00005IC54,"Don't be fooled by the heavily stylized violence and fun-to-watch action sequences. ""Boondock Saints"" may, at times, be entertaining, but it is a phenomenally miserable movie. It seems director Troy Duffy can't decide what he wants his film to be. After gleefully glorifying the violent vigiliantism of two Boston Irishmen wreaking havoc on the Russian mob, Duffy takes a turn about 3/4 of the way through and decides to let the audience know that perhaps the best answer to criminals isn't for civilians to throw toilets on their bald, evil heads (I'm not making this up). While I'm sure Duffy thought he was breaking stereotypes and being progressive by making William DeFoe both a tough cop and (gasp!) gay, Duffy fails miserably on this count. DeFoe's cop is abrasive, his lover (who thankfully makes only a brief appearence) is pathetically stereotypical, and of course, in the end, DeFoe just HAS to go undercover as a woman... Perhaps most annoying of all, the movie, when not silly and incoherent, is heavy-handed; Duffy too explicitly asks us to ""think"" about vigiliantism. Unfortunately, the bad guys are so cardboard and obnoxious, you want them dead from the start of the movie. There's no moral ambiguity whatsoever. On the upside, there are some entertaining action sequences, and Sean Patrick Flanery and most of the other actors give at least mildly believable performances. The real problem with ""Boondock Saints"" is the script, though it will no doubt provide inspiration to aspiring screenwriters who need to see something truly terrible to know that maybe they too can make it big.",1024876800,23,1601,5.068181818181818

The acting is quite good. But the scenarios are so implausible, and the director is trying oh so hard to make another Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels that it became very hard to watch this film.
My recommendation: see a Guy Ritchie or Tarantino film (again). And if you must see this film, rent it. So that you can be rid of it in 5 days.",1023580800,2,586,4.376146788990826

Boondock Saints is incredibly well done.  As far as I know, this is Troy Duffy's first movie effort (if not first American movie) and it is superb.  Read the other reviews for what it's all about - and go out and get it.  You won't be disappointed.  It is in a class all its own, so I can't really compair it to anything else - it's a comedy at times, a drama at times, and a bit of a moral dilemma.  I particularly liked the citizen comments at the end of the movie...
Also, the music on the movie is kickin'!  I wish they had made a soundtrack, but they didn't.

1436633,5,B00005IC54,"This film is about the work of God to rid the world of the corrupt by two Faithful Irish men living in South Boston, the MacManus brothers. The movie opens on St. Patrick's Day with the two brothers in a Catholic service. The priest states that we must all fear evil men and the indifference of good men.
The brothers and their friends, including our comic relief and member of the Italian mob, Don Della Rocco, are at MacGintey's bar, owned by a character suffering Terret's Syndrome by the name of ""Doc,"" when a trio of Russian crime syndicates demand the bar closed. (Apparently, the Russians are putting buildings up all over the neighborhood.) A bar-fight breaks out between the two groups and eventually ends in the MacManus brothers killing the Russians out of self-defense. They turn themselves into the police and are put into a holding cell so they don't have to face the media swarming the station. In the night, they are awakened simultaneously and receive a relevation that they are to ""Destroy that which is evil, so that which is good may flourish."" Accordingly, the rest of the movie is about these boys, with the help of their friend Rocco, killing the corrupt of South Boston.
The main concerns in contemporary North American life that Boondock Saints seem to be addressing is that many people have lost their Faith in God and have committed great acts against Him. ""There are varying degrees of evil. We urge you lesser forms of filth, not to push the bounds and cross over into true corruption, into our domain. For if you do, one day you will look behind you and see we three and on that day, you will reap it. And we will send you to whatever god you wish"" (MacManus brothers in the court scene). God has apparently ordained the MacManus men to judge the corrupt and remove them from His perfect world so that the good may thrive. ""Never shall innocent blood be shed. Yet, the blood of the wicked shall flow like a river. The three shall spread their blackened wings and be the vengeful strike and hammer of God."" The values stated by Murphy MacManus in the court scene, are the following: ""do not kill, do not rail, do not steal. These are principles which every man of every faith can embrace."" (To 'rail' can mean many things including ""to flow, or gush down, usually said of blood; to jest or to rally; or to brag or boast."")

1436638,5,B00005IC54,"This is a surprisingly entertaining movie.  When seen on the video shelf (which is how most people have seen it), this looked like just another fill-in, low-budget, cliche-ridden, violent, and amatuerish effort.... It is far from it.  I can't remember being more favorably impressed with a movie that I'd heard absolutely nothing about.

A well-paced opening sequence introduces us to a pair of Irish brothers stuck on the low end of society.  As the story unfolds, we note the light sprinkling of religious tattoos and an unexpected fluency in a wide variety of foreign languages.  Where did these guys come from?  Why are they special?  These questions are answered slowly and fairly masterfully throughout the course of the movie.

Flashbacks and double-takes on certain events are used to move the plot, thankfully without any of the self-aware empty cuteness that you see posing as creativity in a lot of movies.  After the first one, I was hooked and eagerly awaited the next.  Some may dismiss this device as a Tarantino knock-off, but I thoroughly enjoyed the way the movie handed out tidbits of information allowing us to try to keep up with what the characters on the screen were experiencing.  And I'll take a good Tarantino-esque vibe anyday.  A captivating movie.

Troy Duffy is the writer/director on this grim little gem.  That saves me the trouble of figuring out which job deserves more credit for an suprisingly thrilling piece of work.

Willem Dafoe gives a great performance as an experienced, eccentric Federal Agent.  You'll be adding ""-ology"" to a lot of words after this movie, and smiling about it.  Sean Patrick Flannery and Norman Reedus play the brothers.  David Della Rocca puts in a frenzied but ultimately effective performance as their low-end mobster friend.  Billy Connolly Rounds out the cast, putting in a too-brief appearance as the mob's hitman of choice.

BONUS UPDATE:  The DVD's Director commentary track blames the Columbine shooting as the sole reason this film went straight to video.  At the time, I took the director at his word for this, but the documentary ""Overnight"" paints a very different and much more interesting picture of what really happened to this film, and its flash-in-the-pan director/writer.

This happened to me several times while watching BOONDOCK SAINTS. It is an overwhelming tour de force.
In today's world of moral relativism, nihilism, and hedonism, BOONDOCK SAINTS is an extremely refreshing change. It chronicles the lives of two Irish brothers in Boston who have been charged by God to cleanse the city of evil men, and the savvy and worldly FBI agent on their case. It is the story of real men, men who plant their sword in the ground and would die for the cause in which they believe. Some might call this dangerous fanaticism. They just might be right. The beauty of this film is that, in the spirit of intellectual honesty, it even questions its heroes. This fact is another refreshing change from standard Hollywood films in which the ""good"" guy kills a bunch of people, gets the girl, and no one asks any questions.
Stylistically, freshman Troy Duffy attempts to imitate Guy Ritchie. Even the box says ""in the tradition of Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels."" Yet Duffy fails in this regard on two counts. First, he isn't nearly as stylish as Ritchie; and second, he is far better than him. Whereas Ritchie's films are mostly enjoyable, but essentially empty, Duffy's BOONDOCK SAINTS tackles very serious intellectual and spiritual issues in a very satisfying manner.

1436683,1,B00005IC54,"I did not like this movie.  I did not enjoy a moment of it.  The Boondock Saints was just a superficial cross between Scorsese's Mean Streets and Quentin Tarantino with a twist of Badlands.  I have just mentioned two great films and one extraordinarily gifted filmmaker.  You take these three ingredients, throw them into a pot, boil them and serve them and you are left with a bad taste in your mouth.
The film is about two brothers who feel that some local gangsters are making life miserable for the people in their community so they take it upon themselves to eliminate these gangsters.  Supposedly they become heros to the locals.  The FBI, led by Willem Dafoe in a throwaway performance, are also on their tails.  The main thing that I had a problem with was that it is never really convincingly established that the gangsters are that bad.  Not to say that they are good but I guess that the writer thinks that by giving them the title of gangster it makes it okay that the two brothers kill them off.
Willem Dafoe gives a wacky, over-the-top performance that somehow seems like it may have played better in another movie.  Billy Connelly from Mrs. Brown plays another killer who coincidentally ends up joining the bros in their vigilante exercises.
The problem that I had with the film is that I could never believe that what the brothers were doing was justifiable.  They seemed more like the villains, more heartless and coldblooded than the gangsters ever were.
The end of the film put the nail in the coffin when during the credit sequence you get to hear all of these civilians commenting on what they thought of the bros.  Some thought that what they were doing was good and justifiable.  Others thought that they were no better than the gangsters.  And it goes back and forth.  I guess it was trying to comment of society and the media and their love/hate relationship with murderers and other criminal.  Please, tell me something I don't know.  This theme has been presented in so many movies over the past 40 years that it has become almost a cliche.  After all this glorified murder and action the director has the audacity to try and preach this oh so important message to us.  I would just like to thank him for sharing these enlightening facts with us.  Maybe it will make us all better human beings.
The only think that could have saved this film for me is if it had a little ironic twist at the end like two other vigilante-type bros coming out and killing the MacManus brothers.  Then it might get two stars.  Maybe.",1016064000,10,2540,4.575221238938053

Two blue-collar Boston Irish brothers (Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus, who are both terrific!) rid their favorite pub of an influx of Russian gangsters, and soon decide they are on a Mission from God to execute all the 'heavy hitter' criminals from the city. While this makes them local heroes, it also sets sympathetic detective Willem Dafoe on their trail.
The story is reminiscent of the 'Death Wish' series, without the glossy superficiality of the Bronson films. At times funny, at times disturbing, it never loses momentum, with a twist ending is both satisfying and thoroughly insane!
While the violence is graphic, the story is character-driven, and never allows the executions to overwhelm the plot. You actually like the brothers, and may be hard-pressed NOT to root for them, even if you do feel a bit guilty about it!

It's a story for us all...what we would like to do on a regular basis but don't or rather can't due to morale not to mention ethical boundries. Boondock Saints breaks all these leering stereotypes in the sense that it's actually quite holy, divine or what have you.
The bond between the brothers and their devotion to one another is the foundation of the movie. Then mystically they both have a vision so to speak that lends a moment of clarity or realization.

1436866,5,B00005IC54,"Ok by the nick I use you guessed probably could guess I was a huge fan of this movie.  So when I saw amazon was actually selling it (WELL DONE!!!!) i decided to review it. Well I guess I should explain why I loved it:
Criminally under-exposed I came across this movie by chance, Willem Defoe being a great actor persuaded me to see this movie, and oh my word.
Ultra violent yet strangely moral, ultra hip, insanely funny, this movie has EVERYTHING, including a hillarious scene where one character seems to find a 1000 uses for the F-Word and a scene involving a cat - i won't give no more away because its unexpected.
The McManus brothers are two Boston Irish brothers, working in a meat factory and spending their nights in a local bar.  Until the russian mob comes along and a fight breaks out, with the mob looking to take revenge on the two brothers that humiliate them, they escape with the aid of a toilet (no im not joking) and kill the two mobsters.... this sets the scene for Willem Defoe to join the movie as an FBI agent.  With the two brothers believing they are some kind of blues brothers with semi-automatics they set out under ""orders of god"" to rid society of its bad elements.  With Defoe closing in on the two and a mob-runner friend helping them out.
Defoe is as ever excellent, Flannery and Reedus great as the brothers and the hillarious guy who plays Rocco looks like Mick Foley with a foul mouth.  Even Billy Connolly the great scottish  comedian, and The porn Legend Ron Jeremy have bit part roles.
The soundtrack is done by Director Troy Duffy's band The Boondock Saints, and fits the story well, the action and bloodshed while excessive are stylish and some of the movie is beautifully shot, and filled if you care to notice with catholic reference and symbolism that adds explanation and believability to the plot (the tattoos on the broters hands ""Veritas"" and ""Aequitas"" means truth and justice, something very symbolic to their ""mission""), to top it all of the dialogue is fantastic and very very funny, and the visual comedy element is just right.
Tarrantino must have been gutted he didn't make this himself, but the fact that until recently hardly anyone noticed this movie, and that it never really got a proper distrobution due to contractal and production problems with Miramax is terrible.
This movie should be experieced by EVERYONE, many may find it cliched or predictable or just too excessive for their tastes, but its truly a fantastic gem of a movie and I cant rate it highly enough.
While I must concede it probably isn't the best movie ever made, I cant claim it to be the most original or well choreographed or whatever, what matters is that its probably my favourite, and what eventually will be remembered is how well a film is regarded not how well it was made, the success of films that were critical flops proves it, and this movie is head and shoulders above any of those.
Regardless of how big or small a hit it eventually is, it will never leave my collection in any of the 3 forms I currently own it in.",1006819200,,3060,4.544464609800363

An altercation with the Russian mob results in the brothers seemingly receiving a message from God - ""Destroy that which is evil, so that which is good may flourish.""

This is Mike Duffy's first and ONLY film on the market, and if he never makes another one, it won't matter, because he hit a home run on the first swing.
It's quite simplistic in plot when compared to 'Lock, Stock...' or even 'Pulp', but that isn't a bad thing.  It has the frenetic pace of those movies, and a similarly comedic take on their various characters; not to mention the non-linear storytelling those films are now quite famous for.

1436947,5,B00005IC54,"Before I give you my opinion on this movie, I have to preface it by saying that I am a huge fan of Sean Patrick Flanery. He's the reason I bought the movie. (I tried renting it, but it seems video stores were having trouble with people not returning this particular title.) He's the reason I watched it in the first place. I sat down to watch this movie with low expectations, because while I adore Sean, and think he's a talented actor, some of the films he's chosen to make are little... how shall I say this... different?!?
OK, all of that said, here's my review... I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It was stylistic, darkly comic, angry, lighthearted, charming, brutal, violent, intelligent... I know, I know, those seem like a bunch of contradictions. They are. So was this film. Just one contradiction after another. You've read the plot synopsis by now, I'm sure. Two brothers believing they are called by God to rid the world, or at least Boston, of the scum walking around in human form, set out on their mission to exterminate them all. That, in and of itself, is a contradiction. Getting rid of the bad guys by killing them makes the McManus brothers better people how exactly? This is the same delima faced by Willem Dafoe's character - he was WONDERFUL, by the way... what a performance! - as the facts of each of the murders fall into place and it is discovered that the targets of these murders are 'bad guys' only.
But I digress. Let's get to the root of things. The cast was great, plain and simple. Every one of them. I would have to say Willem Dafoe was my favorite, Sean Patrick was a close second (I'm a bit biased, but he really was good). And everyone else is tied for third. There was a startling lack of women in this movie. Like, aside from some extras in a few scenes, the news reporter, and the 'interviews' at the end, there weren't any. That's fine with me, because as a rule, I would say this is more of a guys' film anyway. My reason for that statement - and I didn't say it just get a rise out of the feminists of the world; after all I'm a woman, and I loved this movie - is that this an incredibly violent film. Lots, and I mean LOTS of blood and dying are involved.
Ok, I know I got off the subject more than once. Sorry about that. I loved the style of this movie, the flashbacks and the reconstruction of the second to last major gun battle being my favorite parts. I thought the news reports, and interviews with the public were a nice touch. And there's a little surpise toward the end that I never saw coming... possibly because by then I was wrapped up in the story, and the action.

1436990,5,B00005IC54,"It seems like the only way anyone hears about this movie, its either from fanatic word of mouth or from seeing it sitting in Blockbusters. Thats a shame, because this first outing by director Troy Duffy is an extremely cool film that deserves all the attention it can get.
Sean Patrick Flannery and Norman Reedus play two good ole Irish Catholic boys in Boston, who one day get sick of the corruption in the city and begin a bloody crusade to wipe it out. Willem DaFoe plays the FBI agent hot on their trail, who is torn between bringing the mysterious vigilantes to justice, or joining their crusade.
The film is, simply put, cool. Its one of the only movies that actually make going to church look cool. Don't be fooled by the description, however; this is not an action movie. Do not expect blazing gun battles with crazy angles and MTV like editing. This is a film about morality, doing what one thinks is right, and having codes of honour. It's about all those things, and how close they may sometimes get to walking the edge between good and evil.
The two actors who play the Irish vigilantes are great in their roles, playing the boys not as superheroes, but as regular joes with a huge chip on their shoulder. A nice twist in the film is DaFoe's portrayel of the FBI agent, who also happens to be gay. He plays him as a great character without being tempted to dip into stereotypes. Great job by the versatile actor.
This is definately a movie not to be missed. If you are fortunate to see this in your video store, take it out and enjoy.",996624000,218,1546,4.428070175438597

Otherwise, this is the movie you have been waiting for!  I honestly don't know what else to say, except that you have to see this movie!  This is a film that defies description.

The Japanese version contains the Director's uncut version of the film (a lot of violence was cut from the DVD sold here on Amazon).

The premise is two you Irish catholic boys have been sent a meesage from God. The message is that there is a battle on earth between good and evil, God sends them as soldiers to fight the evil of south boston. Although this may not seem so complex, this movie achieves and portrays its message effectively on several levels. Basically, the Irish brothers believed in absolute moral conviction, and that they are Gods tools in the on going battle.

This movie definitely should be re-released in theatres.  The man who wrote talked to another guy and had another script written out for another movie.  No word on when this will come out but the fact is this was discussed a long while ago and is over due.

Buy it! See it! Love it or hate it!
The plot in a sentence: two fraternal twins are on a mission from God (no less!) to eradicate Boston of organized crime.
Direction is beautiful, story telling is complex, yet very clear and understandable. What about action, you say? Well, shoot-outs can hold its ground even against John Woos Hong Kong ""bullet ballets""...
Did I mention humour? Tons of it, if you like a bit odd, a bit sick, non PC humour...
The only thing that may bother you a bit is a lot of shouting, but this is over the top movie with over the top performances.

1437043,5,B00005IC54,"The Boondock saints is a revelation.  The casting is a bit of mystery-for instance why Dafoe? but the film itself is impeccable.  Billy Connolly has a lamentably small part as a Leon type killer( even extended to the mantra given to him ""no women no kids"") but is obviously imbued with a sense of morality and ""aequitas"". The role is largely non speaking but the sheer physical impact is immense.  Similarly, Dafoe is a Norman Stansfield moulded cop, played with high camp and a love of classical music.  Oddly, however, the tone of Dafoes agent is perfect for a film which mixes surreal, brutal fantasy with  unrelenting reality.  Norman Reedus (aka Mr Helena Christenson) finally displays a flair for gritty acting and Sean Patrick Flanery finally sheds that ""pretty boy"" persona for which he has become synonimis  In style the film reminds me much of Phil Joanous ""State of Grace"", so much so in fact, at first I believed it to be older than it actually was.  There are faults with ""Boondock saints"" which cannot be ignored.  The violence is unflinching,often gratuitous and occasionally portrayed with cartoon like simplicity.  The ending over which the credits run is contrived and false.  However, despite these errors of judgement from Duffy, the sheer energy dynamism, pace and look of the film, not only marks him as a promising filmmaker, but also earns his debut an uncompromising five stars.",993340800,2,1403,4.927659574468085

Then I borrowed a friend's DVD collection and came across this movie called ""Boondock Saints"".So I watched it,and the rest is history. It is violent so if this bothers you then don't watch it. Here's my breakdown on a scale of 0-5(with 5 being the best): -Cinematography 5 -Dialouge 5 -Story 5 -Casting 5 -Performances by actors 5 This movie is all about the question of whether it is right or wrong to take out evildoers with violence kind of like the Punisher from the comics. The story is told with style and finess. Everything about this movie is top notch which is why Braveheart is now my 2nd favorite movie of all time. Braveheart was ALMOST perfect on every score but Boondock Saints IS perfect. I am surprised that money grubbing Hollywood hasn't re-released this movie with major marketing. I would definately pay my $8 to see this on the big screen. Enjoy....",993254400,13,981,4.64367816091954

And behind this ethical question, there is a great movie, wich power - I believe - comes from its characters: the McManus, two nave, imature brothers, who believe they have a mission from God, wich is killing all the ""mafiosos"" in town (""Evil men, dead men"".); Detective Paul Smecker, the hilarious gay detective, who has a particular talent to understand what happened in a crime scene; Yakavetta, the cynic, cold-blooded godfather; Il Dulce, the heartless cleaner (is he the McManus' father?); and, last, but not least, Rocco, the funniest and most confused killer candidate.  In addition, it has excelent dialogues - not to mention the pray they make before every execution - and very good action/shooting scenes.  And remember: ""Do not kill. Do not rape. Do not steal. These are principles which every man of every faith can embrace.""

To say that I thought it was great, would be an understatment.  There are no words to describe how much I liked it.  Don't get me wrong, it wasn't life-altering or anything, but I do now own it.
The heart of the movie is about vigilantism.  God has seen fit to anoint the McManus brothers as his angels of death. And woe be to those that they deem evil and darken their door.
It was directed by Troy Duffy, employs a wicked cast of characters, and distributed by Blockbuster.  The strength of the movie is characterized by the fact that it's survived on word of mouth alone.
By the end of the movie, you'll most likely be catching yourself employing memorable lines from the movie and giggling whenever you see William Defoe in other movies.

I agree that the cast, especially the twins, is more than incredible! I catch myself watching other movies just because that I see their name there. Probably the best acting in a movie ever!
And the movie itself is so incredible good wrote and directed that I haven't ever seen anyone come near it! The action scenes in slow motion and with an incredible music, make me roll it over and over....and over again. There is a lot of violence, allthough never unnecessary much. On top of being action-packed it is hilarious! I've never experienced such humor before. The cat-scene, the Wyatt Earp-scene and the crawling in the air-shaft still cracks me up! I actually can't get enough of it. I must have seet ""The Boondock Saints"" at least 15 times, and still some 15 to go! I have never heard anyone say that this ISN'T the best movie ever. All my friends are hooked, allthough it is mostly a boys-movie. We even learned the prayer:
""And Shepards We Shall Be, For Thee My Lord For Thee. Power Hath Descented Forth From Thy Hand, That Our Feet May Swiftly Carry Out Thy Command. So We Shall Flow A River Fort To Thee, And Teeming With Souls Shall It Ever Be. In Numine Dei Patris. It Filii...Spiritus Sancti.....BOOM!""
I also started dressing like the twins, black coat and dark sun-glasses. They've become my idols, and thet's almost scary. I descided to rate only one movie here, and that was to be the best movie I had ever seen. It was never any questions. I've seen a lot of good movies (I love Matrix, Leon, Braveheart...) but they can't even compare to this one. It's in a genre that I have never seen before, and I am hoping for other films like it, maybe a sequel (not very likely) It's a shame that films like this don't get any attention. If hollywood had beed introduced proparely to ""The Boondock Saints"" I am convinced that it would have been one of the greatest, most popular films EVER!
