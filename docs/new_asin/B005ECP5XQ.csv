Poor copy of video tape source for the Fearless Hyena. How do I know, during the final battle scene, we see an area where the tape got crinkled, and the video distorted for a second. Heavily cropped image to fit old TV screens. Video is squarish in format. Sort of like watching a moving picture in a 35mm slide.

Fearless Hyena 2. Is either pirated in a  theater or copied from a TV screen. Picture a dark in areas, and there are different shifts in color cast on the sides. This film is is not square, and more closer to what it originally looked like. But I suspect this is still a cropped film source.

I will update this review, as I watch all of the films.
Despite poor quality sources, these are classic Jackie Chan movies for a cheap price. Bought this set specifically so I could see the Fearless Hyena, which was the first Jackie Chan movie I ever saw.",1484611200,,1133,4.380952380952381
