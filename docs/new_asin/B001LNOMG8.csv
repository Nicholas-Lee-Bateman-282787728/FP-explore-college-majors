3688305,5,B001LNOMG8,"Sinister cinema have put out a beautiful print of Goliath Against the Giants.

Its full 2.35.1 Widescreen,it looks RESTORED. Very clean blemish free print

Superb Color too.

 Its not 16.9 Anamorphic,so you have to zoom up the picture, but on my 70inch JVC
it still looks superb.
A High Bit rate was used.
It even has the Trailer in Widescreen.

  Highly Recommended.",1289779200,14,367,4.82258064516129
8319073,4,B001LNOMG8,"Back in the 1960s I used to see these dubbed ""epics"" on T.V. every weekend.  I remembered this one as a peplum favorite, so I ordered it, based on positive fan reviews.  It turns out to be from a pristine print, widescreen, with great color and sound.  Sinister Cinema, a fringe outfit, have done themselves proud.  The trailer, in dramatic Italian, is amazingly in good shape too.  And it seems the real title of this Italian/Spanish made opus is the same as in English, even though you don't see the giants until near to the end of the movie.  You will see first a sea monster (well handled), a tribe of Amazons in Amy Winehouse-style wigs, a murderous orangutan, and after the giants, a fire-breathing dragon.  It looks more expensive than most muscleman epics, and is action-packed.

There are also some doses of good-old sadism, courtesy of the usurper, King Bokan, played in a bored/hammy  manner by respected actor Fernando Rey.  He has some citizens tossed down a cliff into the smoky lair of the giants and dragons.  Later, Bokan is watching a last-man standing gladiatorial spectacle.  The last fighter, a Russell Crowe type, wearily raises his sword arm as the crowd roars with approval.  But Bokan, just stifling a yawn, says to his top archer, ""The poor fellow is suffering.  We can't let him keep suffering.""  Whoosh-WHUMP!  Arrow through the winner's throat!  The crowd gets angry.  ""That's enough of that!"" yells the King's spokesmen at them.  Later, during the big battle between Goliath's soldiers and Bokan's elite troops, we get a P.O.V. between two of the fighters in close-up.  Bokan soldier, real angry, swinging hard with sword-strokes.  Goliath soldier, equally heated, lays on a deadly one.  Bokan soldier, half his face displaying Heinz 57 Varieties, crumbles, yelling, ""AAAHHHH!"" It was for nasty stuff like this that I sat glued to my T.V. in the 1960s.  Quite tame compared with movies today.

Otherwise, you have American muscleman Brad Harris, with curly reddish hair and beard, running, jumping, climbing, fighting, and sweet-talking beautiful Gloria Milland.  Fernando Sancho, a rough and ready Spanish actor, is on hand in Goliath's battle cadre.  Sancho played the madman cured by Jesus in ""King of Kings,"" and the Turkish sergeant who arrests T.E. Lawrence in ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" as well as many a Spaghetti Western bandit chief. Really, if you like sword-and-sandal silliness, ""Goliath Against the Giants"" will give you a kick.  Good choice to go with a groaning pizza and a jug of Italian red wine.  You'll have fun!",1437609600,,2557,4.966981132075472
8319074,4,B001LNOMG8,"Peplum goes full on Bayhem with this entry. The story is pretty simple, noble warrior Goliath finds out that since he's been away at war his country has been taken over by a tyrant who wants to kill him before he can return home and lead a rebellion. Simple right? Well the first act almost completely bungles that. Nevertheless the gorgeous camera work, set design and non stop action make up for it. Very Michael Bay-esque",1436054400,,424,4.592105263157895

8319078,5,B001LNOMG8,"Great spectacle, lots of action, fun episodic plot.  The ""giants"" are really a bunch of neanderthals, but the valley with the giant lizards still makes for a fun climax.  It's one of the best of all the myth-inspired pepla.",1356998400,,223,4.6923076923076925

As a Sinister Cinema product (and they do handle some grey market material), I was not expecting it to be all that good, but it was much better than expected.",1293321600,12,314,4.7272727272727275
