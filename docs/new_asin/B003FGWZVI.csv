4118543,5,B003FGWZVI,"Very good behind the scenes clip, they had several of these and all were very good, the audience got to ask
some of the cast members as well as the writers/producers questions and the answers help you understand the show.",1385510400,5,221,4.55
4118544,5,B003FGWZVI,It was enjoyable looking back on what was to be the end of the series and to hear the creators discuss the show.  It was also nice to see the future creators of Once Upon a Time.,1366416000,4,178,3.810810810810811

8395959,5,B003FGWZVI,"If you are a lost fan, the writers and producers offered some great (and funny) insight into the story lines for the best TV series ever!",1486598400,,137,4.3076923076923075
8395960,5,B003FGWZVI,"It's quite captivating,and interesting, It also keeps you wanting to see more. It was very nice to watch it without commercials. I was so taken in by what will happen next we watched several showings in one night. The story about the island is intriguing  and makes you want to know where is this place and can I go there for all of its healing attributes. I was in a bad accident and like John Lock it would be great if I could go through something like that and be able to walk again. I wouldn't want to leave either. Seems they all had plenty to eat and had plenty of fresh water. Then they find the lock door to the safe place under the ground and that just makes it to where why would you want to leave if you were once disabled and you can walk again!! I'd never want to leave, especially with there being plenty of fish and wild game and all the fresh fruit. Seems like paradise to me. This was a very cool show, I enjoyed watching it!",1474588800,,942,4.119565217391305
8395961,5,B003FGWZVI,"Great info about the show. Free to watch with prime. The reunion, however, isn't free. Bummer.",1468713600,,94,4.9375
8395962,3,B003FGWZVI,"If you are a ""LOST"", freak like I am, you will find this to be an interesting video.  However, the fact that there were only four cast members was disappointing.  Even more disappointing was the fact that the cast members had only a small part in the discussion, as the moderator, who was particularly annoying, directed most of the questions to the writers.",1456963200,,358,4.666666666666667
8395963,3,B003FGWZVI,"I was hoping for more actors to be present.  There were only 4, and not many questions were addressed to them.  It revolved around the process of writing the story mainly.",1455840000,,171,4.483870967741935
8395964,4,B003FGWZVI,Would've been great to see and hear a little more from the cast.,1411171200,4,64,4.0
8395965,5,B003FGWZVI,For those who love Lost this Paleyfest interview with some writers and actors is fun to watch.  It was recorded in February 2010 while they were still filming. Knowing how the show ends and watching how the writers try not to give it away is touching.,1401580800,,251,4.456521739130435
8395966,3,B003FGWZVI,"This was a informative gathering but a little dis-jointed in execution.  I had hoped for much more exposition, for such a challenging series. However, over all very enjoyable.",1395705600,,175,5.25
8395967,5,B003FGWZVI,Love love and love it can't stop watching this show keeps u guessing to see what happens next!! Love it,1393372800,,103,4.2
