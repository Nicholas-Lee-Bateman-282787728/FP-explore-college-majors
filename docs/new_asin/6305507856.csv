1042885,4,6305507856,"Terence Hill became an international superstar with this superb film, and  so did Bud Spencer. They play gunslinging outlaw half brothers who end up  trying to help protect a Mormon settlement from a band of Mexican  desperado's. While the Mormon's turn the other cheek, the desperado's  quickly learn the Trinity brothers will not. They follow  the eye for an  eye tooth for a tooth teaching. But it's not just the Mexican's who want  the Mormon settlement, another band of cut throats want it too, and  eventually team up with the desperado's to try and take it. With all these  outlaws what's the two Trinity brothers to do? Well, I won't say, but I  will tell you that this movie is packed with lots of hilarious comedy,  great action, and a taste of suspense. One interesting twist to this movie  is that Bambino (played by Bud Spencer) is sheriff of the nearby town. How  he got the job is a laugh riot in itself. This is a movie the whole family  can watch and enjoy, and the sequel (Trinity is still my Name) is equally  entertaining .",965779200,7,1043,4.532258064516129

I am still  trying to locate a ""Trinity"" Movie I saw at the Drive-In in the  Summer of 1974. It was a western with Terence Hill called ""A Man From  the East"" and it showed him just coming over from Ireland as a real  pantywaist and learning from scratch how to fight and use a gun.

Bud Spenser (aka bambeano) and Terrance  Hill (Trinity) are two likeable rouges in this first in a series of  westerns who getup to all types of mischief throughout the film. Fast guns  and plenty comical fight scenes make the film an all time classic for me.

1042956,4,6305507856,"The wit and unexpected humor of ""They Call Me Trinity"" was sadly marred by poor color and audio, despite a strong plot and intriguing religious subtext.

Trinity is a fast, but relaxed gun fighter, and his brother is a lazy horse thief pretending to be a sheriff to hide his crimes. Both protect a community of Mormons (who act like Amish) who do not believe in violence.

Trinity is lot like Eastwood/Blondie in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, with a certain James Bond charm. He is not the usual brash gunman, but is twice and tough, and twice as sweet. A great character.

In the spaghetti western tradition, mimicking ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly,"" this film has all Italian cast. The dubbing didn't cut it, as it seemed imposed on the movie more than it was integrated.

I'd like to see the series remade. It is that much fun.

I recommend ""They Call Me Trinity."" The movie is funny, and worth renting, but buying it is only for the true fans of the genre.

1042961,5,6305507856,"With 43 Reviews already posted,just about everything good or bad has been said. Suffice to say,I thoroughly enjoyed this  and plan to watch it over again,because I'm sure I missed some things.
 This is a 1971 Spaghetti Western. The claim is that it a slapstick comedy crossed with the Magnificent Seven and comparable to Blazing Saddles.
 Well,I guess it is all that; but most of all, just great entertainment and a lot of fun. I found all the characters ,action,and bigger than life situations and exaggerations,great;but if you are looking for serious historical or moralistic descriptions or messages---forget it!
 We certainly have Italy to thank for this movie. All the actors are Italian,except for Farley Granger (how did he get involved in this?).It was filmed in Italy,so don't lexpect it to ""look like the Old West"" scenery wise.
 Trinity,played by Terence Hill is about as far from being your typical Old West gunfighter or lawman or whatever as you you want to call him. You will finally get to know him as no more than a free spirit,who likes to be a thorn in the side of his older brother,doesn't shy away from  a good rollicking brawl,in fact,rather enjoys it;particularly if there is a pretty girl around ,or a chance to right a few wrongs along the way. Just about everything that goes into making a good western is incorporated,though carried to the extreme. As a matter of fact,it takes a totally out of control brawl and makes it look more like a form of entertainment.
So,if you want 2 hours of pure fun,though maybe even spoofing typical westerns,grab a box of popcorn and a drink,and sit back and enjoy it.
 As to all the complaints and criticism about the quality of the different productions;all I can say is that I was completely satisfied with my version.

1043006,5,6305507856,"but still brings a laugh. I still remember the patented Bud Spencer thunk on the head. The surgery scene was priceless where the knife was heat disinfected and then wiped across Bud's never washed shirt, or the patient becoming an alcholic, or Terence Hill pulling his dirty clothes back on after the soak. Just introduced this to the latest generation of our family. Tanks for the memories.",1149292800,2,391,4.850746268656716
1043007,4,6305507856,"A drifter named Trinity (Terence Hill) slides into a dusty frontier town where he discovers his outlaw brother Bambino (Bud Spencer) is sheriff.  Disguised as sheriff, that is.  Bambino wants to rustle a herd of valuable horses; Trinity is enamored of a pair of comely Mormon lasses.

  There's more to THEY CALL ME TRINITY than that, of course, but not a lot more.  The Mormons want to settle in a nearby valley and build a community.  An unscrupulous land-baron (Farley Granger) wants to intimidate them out.  There's a band of Mexican banditos swooping down every so often to test the resolve of the peace loving settlers. The draw of this one, though, is the quiet comedy and the interplay between Hill and Spencer.  Hill's Trinity is lithe and tanned, Bambino is bearded and hulking - they've got a Little Joe & Hoss thing going.  Impossibly quick on the draw and dominating in all of the film's many fights, Trinity is about as laid-back a spaghetti western hero as you're going to find.  Heck, he rides in to and out of the movie barefoot and asleep on a makeshift stretcher dragged by his horse, holstered gun trailing in the dust.  Hollywood (and Italia) was cranking out counter-culture rebels with droning regularity back in the late sixties/early seventies, most with `off the man' `tudes and ten-pound chips on their shoulders.  What's refreshing about Trinity is that about the only thing he's rebelling against is physical exertion and grown-up responsibility.  Bambino may be a crook, but he's agreeably grumpy and, besides, those horses he wants to rustle belong to the evil Major.

 THEY CALL ME TRINITY is usually called a comedy-western, but its humor provokes smiles rather than belly laughs. It's a good, fun, unchallenging way to spend an hour and a half.  Unfortunately, the Direct Source video version is pretty hard on the eyes.  It's presented in full-screen, edited down from its 2.35:1 aspect ration.  Worst of all the picture looks like it was duped off a bad video tape - indistinct images, faded colors, etc.  This one isn't a classic, but it's one of the better spaghetti westerns, and deserves a better presentation than it gets here.",1148947200,5,2168,4.871584699453552

Terance Hill does a great job as Trinity. For instance in the opening scene Trinity has to sit and eat a whole pan of beans, which he puts away quite quick...I read on his website that he starved himself for 24 hours in order to do that scene.

This is also a film the whole family could watch and enjoy.

I would also recommend Trinity's third film ""My Name Is Nobody"" which stars Henry Fonda.

Anyway...if you like good western fun then I would say buy this dvd and enjoy.",1125187200,4,636,4.319327731092437
1043010,4,6305507856,"This is a delightful comedy spoofing the spaghetti western genre. It does do with a saucy sense of humor.

The story is of a pair of brothers. One is an outlaw posing as a sherrif to hide from the law. The other is a ne'er do well brother who is fast with a gun and faster with his dry wit. Each brother for his own reasons decides to help a group of Mormon farmers and protect them from the guy who wants their valley. The old brother does so because he wants to steal the rich man's horses. The younger just wants to steal the Mormon's daughters.

Nothing is taken too seriously in this film including fancy production values. It comes across as an inexpensively made Italian Wester because that is what it is. That does not prevent it from being entertaining. Unfortunately, the low production values seem to have carried over into the DVD transfer. I don't know is this is due to the poor quality of the original film or if it was just a bad job. Whatever the case, it is still very watchable and enjoyable.

1043062,3,6305507856,"First, let me explain the three stars are for the DVD, not the Trinity Boys (they are 5 star all the way). What we need is a digital restoration of Terence Hill movies. The Spaghetti Western genre relied on several gimmicks: obtuse plots, quirky characters, superhuman heroes, great music, and lastly INTENSE,VIBRANT COLORS. Unless you catch them on the Western Channel, almost all home video versions of these movies are faded travesties. This dvd is better than most, but is nothing compared to the original. This is even more true of Boot Hill. If you've never seen the intensity of Terence Hill's blue eyes set into his impossibly tan face, then you can't begin to realize how much the color has faded. I remember watching Terence Hill in Boot Hill back at a drive-in and thinking ""my gosh, he's darker than Woody Strode!""
  As for Trinity, it holds up wonderfully 30 years later as a classic parody of Spaghetti Westerns. The two brothers are straight out of the more humorous work of Max Brand: gifted with extraordinary skill bordering on the supernatural with which they better their adversaries in outlandish ways. The sequel was just as good and I wish they had made ten more of them. Lacking that, somebody please restore these wonderful films!",1076198400,7,1255,4.832558139534884

1043064,5,6305507856,"""They call Me Trinity""  deserves six stars except for the poor video quality.  This looks a UMAX tape version that has been overly compressed by mpeg 2 in it's conversion from tape to digital. It's a shame that one of the greatest Italian westerns ever made should have been treated in this way. My understanding is that the beautiful film-to-digital video transfers [for example 'Los Campaneros' or 'Day of Anger'] have been scanned from original 35mm film in a Rank or Ampex video conversion machine that converts the 35mm image directly to digital video with little or no compression, but 'Trinity' obviously did not get that treatment. 'Trinity' stars Bud Spencer [real Italian name is Carlo Pedersoli] and Terrence Hill [Mario Girotti] as two at-odds brothers, one a rough diamond and the other an accomplished intelligent goofball. The plot is fairly simple with the two brothers trying to prevent a gang of outlaws from terrorizing a group of farmers and stealing their land.  Much of the humor in this film is very subtle and can only be appreciated after viewing two or three times.  The test of a good movie is multiple watchability and Trinity certainly succeeds with every scene containing importance and entertainment value. The interaction with the farmers becomes a little tedious in the end and parts could have been cut since the movie is fairly long at nearly two hours. In fact the length of the movie may account for the excessive video compression on DVD. The editing style is more consistent with older movies and wham-bam-thank-you-mam fans may not like the pace.  Even so this is a very special entry and the humor is engaging and optimistic and never stilted or patronizing, and the action scenes are also extremely well done. Hence the classic nature of this film as a spaghetti favorite.  Will end on the usual disclaimer with spaghettis: traditional 'John Wayne' western fans probably won't like this movie and will rate it with low marks, however that is a tremendous shame because 'Trinity' is a solid gold spaghetti classic!",1065571200,6,2055,4.942028985507246

1043066,5,6305507856,"I vividly remember watching several Bud Spencer/Terence Hill films in the early 1980s. This Italian comedy team always provided lots of laughs with the crazy situations each of their films put them in, and these two goofballs were in a lot of different situations, from westerns to car races to cop films. Throughout it all, the formula always stayed the same: Spencer played the taciturn giant who always found himself roped into yet another misadventure by kind hearted Hill. What followed usually involved several awesomely choreographed fistfights (actually hilarious slapfests), slapstick comedy on a level one rarely sees, and a sappy ending where the two save some unfortunate soul who needed their help. I am hoping for a DVD release of ""Crimebusters,"" but until then I will take what I can get from these two funny actors. This means watching films like ""They Call Me Trinity""
""They Call Me Trinity"" is really a spoof of the popular spaghetti western genre so prevalent during the late 1960s and early 1970s. In this engaging comedy, Spencer and Hill play two gunslingers caught up in the harsh realities of the Old West. The film opens with a shot of Trinity (Hill) lounging on a rickety sled pulled by his horse across a baking desert (shades of Corbucci's ""Django""?). Trinity arrives at a hole in the wall restaurant where he takes some guff from a couple of bounty hunters who don't like his looks. When the two thugs discover they are facing down Trinity, the fear on their faces is unmistakable because this unassuming, dirty creature facing them is the fastest gunslinger in the West, often referred to as ""the right hand of the devil"" due to his amazing speed in drawing an iron.
Trinity easily deals with these two bounty hunters and continues on his journey to meet up with his half-brother Bambino, played by the inestimable Bud Spencer. Bambino is a taciturn giant of a man, seemingly slow to anger but capable of out shooting the most dangerous outlaws in the land. He's so fast they call him ""the left hand of the devil."" When Bambino doesn't feel like putting a man in a coffin, he merely slaps them unconscious with a quick blow to the head. Bambino is less than enthused about the arrival of Trinity, and for good reason: his brother always manages to embroil him in dangerous situations. Since Bambino is actually an outlaw himself hiding behind a sheriff's badge, he does not need the attention Trinity always manages to bring wherever he goes.
This wouldn't be a real western without some ornery villain whose sole purpose in life is to cause misery to everyone in town. In ""They Call Me Trinity,"" that villain is the Major, a southern dandy who raises horses. Major and his gang of miscreants have taken a special disliking to a group of Mormon farmers settling in a nearby valley. Problem is, Trinity takes a liking to two blonde Mormons and now decides to give them a hand, all the while dragging the reluctant Bambino into the resulting fracas. Every attempt Major makes to dislodge Trinity and Bambino fails, often with hilarious results. When Major decides to join forces with some ridiculous hombres in the region for a final showdown with the farmers, the results are quite amusing.
There are at least two sublime joys one gets from watching a Spencer/Hill film. One is the facial expressions and vocalizations of Bud Spencer and the other is the slapstick scenes in each of the duo's films. Bambino is an absolute hoot to watch, always grunting and shrugging with barely repressed disgust as Trinity drags him into yet another problematic situation. Bambino's people skills are sure to draw a chuckle. For instance, on at least two occasions friendly passersby throw out a ""howdy, sheriff"" only to hear Bambino growl ""shut up"" while he keeps on walking. In one scene, Bambino discovers Trinity is in a bad situation and asks hopefully, ""Is he dead?"" only to look crestfallen when informed that his brother is not yet six feet under. The bear like Spencer is a marvelous contrast to the rail thin Hill.
Then there is the omnipresent slapstick. This usually translates into a huge fistfight/slapfest where Spencer and Hill lay waste to huge crowds of enemies. The final fight in ""They Call Me Trinity"" is probably one of the largest in a Spencer/Hill production. There must be fifty guys wailing away on each other for about ten full minutes, with furniture, boards, and fists all delivering punishment in rapid fire succession. The fight scenes in this film aren't as funny as the one in ""Crimebusters"" where Spencer puts a pair of bowling shoes on his hands before beating the tar out of a gang of mafia hoods, but it's still satisfying to watch.
The DVD of ""They Call Me Trinity"" is a mixed bag. This film really deserves a better treatment than the one offered here. The picture quality isn't all that bad, but you can tell there was no restoration performed on the print. In fact, the picture is barely above VCD quality. The audio isn't great, either, with significant background hum between dialogue sequences. As for extras, there is a lame trivia quiz and short biographies on Spencer and Hill. A commentary by Bud Spencer and Terence Hill would be a nice touch, too. Still, the movie is more than watchable and serves as an excellent introduction to the antics of these two funny comedians. I can't wait to see more Spencer/Hill productions come out on DVD.",1058659200,11,5403,4.798283261802575
1043067,1,6305507856,"I'm Sorry! I loved this film, as well as it's sequal. They are clever, detailed, and funny on a number of levels. I enjoy the unglamorous aspects of these westerns that better portay the benefits of living conditions here in the 21st century. Most westerns aren't this thruthfull, despite the fact that these films are spoofs.
When I first attemped to play the DVD, I removed it after 5 minutes, frustrated and disapppointed. I knew, when I ordered it, that it was pan & scan (full screen), and although that was a let down for such an excellent film, I adjusted my enthusiasm accordingly. But this thing looks like a distorted copy of the original VHS tape, only with the edges cropped even tighter. There's less picture viewable than the VHS tape, and to make matters worse, the DVD has, as a result, poorer resolution too. It also has washed out color.
My honest recommendation, if you don't own a copy of this film in any format, is to buy the VHS copy of it. There are no extras on the DVD. So, the only thing you lose by buying a VHS copy is 1) a requirement to rewind the tape, and 2) a 7 year shelf life before degradation starts becoming noticable. And what would you gain with a VHS copy of this excellent film? You'd gain the entire ""Full Frame"" picture in a better quality of color rendering. Maybe you could even record your own DVD-R copy of the VHS tape. Even that would be better than this.

 If you can find a decent copy of this film, it's well worth the effort.",1028332800,13,538,4.59375
1043069,4,6305507856,"The wit and unexpected humor of ""They Call Me Trinity"" was sadly marred by poor color and audio, despite a strong plot and intriguing religious subtext.

Trinity is a fast, but relaxed gun fighter, and his brother is a lazy horse thief pretending to be a sheriff to hide his crimes. Both protect a community of Mormons (who act like Amish) who do not believe in violence.

Trinity is  lot like Eastwood/Blondie in GBU, with a certain James Bond charm. He is not the usual brash gunman, but is twice and tough, and twice as sweet. A great character.

In the spaghetti western tradition, mimicking ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly,"" this film has all Italian cast. The dubbing didn't cut it, as it seemed imposed on the movie more than it was integrated.

I'd like to see the series remade.

I recommend ""They Call Me Trinity."" The movie is funny, and worth renting, but buying it is only for the true fans of the genre.

They are great.  My favorite scene is the gun drawing/face slapping Trinity does to a bad guy!  HILARIOUS!!!  I'm so glad I found them here, and quite by accident I might add.  I intend to add them to my wish list and purchase them ASAP!!!",1027036800,,413,4.1645569620253164
1043121,1,6305507856,"This movie is a waste of time. While browsing for selections for my weekly video night, I came across this early 70's ""classic"". I got it and thought might be ok, because it was supposed to be more comedic than western. It wasn't.
It was horrible. Terence Hill gives a mild performance as Trinity, but otherwise all this movie is a bunch of faux violence between Trinity, his brother and the marauding Mexicans.",1025481600,,411,4.6438356164383565

1043123,5,6305507856,"I have grown up with the italian version of Trinity and the american version still makes me laugh. Picture quality is not brilliant (considering that the film is very old and was never ment to be an oscar movie) but still better than a VHS for sure. I guess the sound could have been somehow corrected though.
I was a bit disappointed by the lack of any subtitles or language selection (I would have appreciated italian language or english subtitles at least) but nevermind I know the italian version word by word.
Do not expect blood and violence (a lot of punches around here but I would not call that violence) this is a film almost suitable for children.
In conclusion? GREAT",1019174400,,679,4.573770491803279

1043125,1,6305507856,"I like this movie and have seen a very nice widescreen showing of it here on New Zealand TV and back in the UK.
The quality of the DVD is worse than a worn out VHS tape. I couldn't believe my eyes. How can a DVD look this bad? Some of my 10 year old VHS tapes look better. Washed-out colour, poor sound, and worse of all, Full Screen. There should be a no star option for the rating of DVDs. This would definitely get it.
I have this and Trinity Is Still My Name and its quality is the same. One of them has a cute quiz game on it maybe even both but I can't bear to watch them after just one viewing.
What is worse is that there is no real alternative; this was not available in region 4 or 2 when I bought it. I do notice that it is now in Germany. Might check that one out.",1013558400,14,776,3.7962962962962963
1043126,4,6305507856,"In this film, Terence Hill (actually an Italian actor) purposely doesn't shave to more closely resemble the Clint Eastwood of Man With No Name fame.  But he does Clint one better--not only does he sport a similar hat, he also wears really raggedy clothes that go hand in hand with his extreme laziness.  Half the time, he doesn't even ride his horse; he lounges on the whatchamacallit that he's tied to his saddle--like a big hammock with wooden struts--big enough to carry a man, pulled by a horse, trailing in the back.  The horse does all the work.
I mean, let's face it, this guy is lazy!  He also eats like a pig, but is the fastest gun in the West.  His half brother's a horse thief but takes over as sheriff in the typical little western town that's run by a typical rich dandy, played to perfection by Farley Granger.  Usually Granger annoys me (cf. Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train), but here he's perfect.
Granger and his men are fixin to destroy the nearby Mormon settlement run by Brother Tobias, a holier-than-thou kinda guy with two hot lookin babes in the fold that Trinity just can't resist.  Throw in some ridiculously immature Mexican banditos and ya gotta tasty brew that's well worth the price of admission, folks.
This Trinity guy is so darned lazy that when Brother Tobias starts reeling off all the tasks Brother Trinity's gotta take care of, the lazy bum--in spite of the babes--heads for the hills with his brother.  What a guy.
The beginning is sorta slow, but stick with it.  It definitely gets better.  The ending is a real hoot.  I ain't never seen so much punchin' in all my life.
Cheap, lotsa fun.  Go for it.",1004054400,,1640,4.559726962457338

1043128,3,6305507856,"This is certainly one of the best Bud Spencer-Terence Hill movies. It is actually much smarter than other Spencer-Hill pictures, because it contains a lot of intertextual references in its wonderfully portrayed western (parody/homage) moments. The music is magnificent too.
I saw this film in Bosnia for the first time when I was kid and I immediately fell in love with it. In a few years I owned over 30 Bud Spencer (and Terence Hill) movies. The version I had in Bosnia (on a pirated VHS tape)had wonderful colours and was rich in detail. Anybody can guess why? Yes, you're right - because it was a WIDESCREEN copy (possibly imported from Italy). This DVD, however, is released in a horrendous PAN & SCAN edition. Many nice details are lost, there is a lot of artificial panning, and in certain action sequences you cannot even decipher what is going on. There are a few moments in which only background is seen, because the characters on both sides of the original widescreen picture (ar: 2,35:1) have been cut off. Furthermore, this DVD has terrible image resolution. Pixillation is present throughout the film (I have some Real Video files on my PC that have better picture quality than this DVD). This DVD, nonetheless, is very cheap. I bought it for 7.99 Canadian dollars (around 5 American dollars). And, of course, this is the best copy of this brilliant film that is available in North America and the reason why everybody should own it. 5 stars for the movie, 1 star for the DVD. All in all, 3 stars from me. I just wish I had my Bosnian widescreen copy.",981158400,20,1565,4.673913043478261
1043129,4,6305507856,"I love Terence Hill and Bud Spencer's movies! They really put you in a good mood with their perfect hiliarousness. I don't care how less sense they make and I didn't care when I was about seven and those movies were the only real cool thing on Television. Absolutely everybody in my class was crazy about Bud Spencer and Terrence Hill, we used to do our schoolyard fights just the way they did with all the mean guys. One day, our Teacher called on our Parents and told them that those movies would make violent lunatics out of us ( it was the same kind of Teacher that told my parents that they were bad parents because they owned a computer and let me play ), but noone that matters really cared. I enjoy those movies even now, they made me laugh more than ""American Pie"" did. Call me silly, but these movies are true genius: The great Dialogue, the way Bud punches his Fist on the Head of basically everyone, how Terence shoots about four guys by playing cards and doesn't seem to care... I am kind of surprised that people call those movies serious western flicks. But it doesn't matter that much. To me, they are hiliarous , far from perfect but they managed to make me laugh after some real terrible events. That's enough to say I like them!",973296000,4,1247,4.379310344827586
