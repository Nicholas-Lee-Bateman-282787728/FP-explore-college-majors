7911286,3,B00000IOUG,"Rock n' Roll Cop was one of the few movies in which Anthony Wong Chau Sang doesn't play a weird, psycho or a slimeball.  The super hot Carrie Ng co-stars as a gun moll and Yu Rong Guang co-stars as well playing the evil mainland Chinese criminal who's on the run looking for Carrie.  Kirk Che Wong shot this movie with several brutal scenes which earned it a Cat. III rating.  But the DVD release is edited and full screen.  When will they re-release this action packed gem?

Recommended for Anthony Wong fans.",1120262400,,510,4.440860215053763
7911287,4,B00000IOUG,"From director Kirk Wong, who also gave us Jackie Chan's most serious film ""Crime Story"", comes this gritty, fast paced, gun-totting CAT III classic!
Begining with estentially a mis-matched cop premise, in pre-1997 Hong Kong and China, this takes a straight laced Mainland cop and teams him up with the reckless goateed Rock N' Roll cop of the title.
If this was a Hollywood picture you would know every move from then on, but as this a not your typical fare, the action is orignal, energetic and sometimes breathtaking. Great action sequences in shopping malls (very different to Chan's classic Police Story, mind you), sliding down sides of buildings shoot-outs in domino halls and bustling street market sting operations.
The film has some very touching sequences - but be warned, it's pretty violent in places.
The downside is the disc. With no extras, and no chapter selection (oh dear) it's worth it's current price only if you can do without all the fancy stuff. Estentially it's more like a VCD copy with a very good image than a proper DVD - but, still, the movie is well worth seeing and compares well to the best of Woo (John Woo, that is).",999907200,6,1150,4.72636815920398
