 done for a nephew who passed away at 21.
I should  have been there with the love and encouragement he needed,
He had a poor self-image he couldn't  mend and I think it  contributed
 a lot to his illness.",1432080000,,270,4.215686274509804
7923282,5,B00004U0LZ,"Sunshine After The Rain (1996).  Adult gay softcore video. Running Time: One hour, 05 mins.
  Directed, produced by Mike Esser and written with Tony Claffrey.
From Czech Republic, but USA DVD version is in English with the men speaking their natural language.

  Seven male friends are all together again for the holiday in Portugal. They have known each other for years, but this is their last summer together before going into the grown up world.

Johan, Matthew and Daniel are suntanning at the pool while the other young men are playing naked in the pool. Daniel doesn't want to join in. He is to worried about his upcoming military duties. They try to get him in the pool for some fun, but Daniel wants no part of it. The guys get dressed.
  Daniel leaves the house and walks towards the beach. Alex and Antoine are behind him keeping an eye on him.
  Johan is on the balcony. He watches Dano downstairs near the lawn. He is taking his white tank top off and then drinks his Coca-Cola.  The other three men are at the beach. Dano is now on the balcony with Johan. They kiss and have sex.
Alex and Antonine are naked and having fun in the beach water on the sand as the tides come in. They french kiss. Daniel leaves the two men alone and he walks on a path. He sees a man laying there sun tanning in his blue and white striped trunks. Alex and Antoine go behind a dune and have sex.
  Later, Matthew and Dano go into a field of wildflowers. Johan and Mikhail make love with emotion and tenderness on the lawn among the palm trees at the other side of the pool.
  Daniel goes back to see the man sun tanning. Now he is laying there naked. Daniel joins him and offers him some soda. The man is Darren. They kiss wildly and have sex quickly. Their sex is hot.
  Laying on a blanket among the wildflowers, Matthew and Dano make love. A clean black and white kitten is watching them.
  Daniel is finally happy and more relaxed. He goes back to Alex and Antoine who are still laying naked with each other. Daniel french kisses both of them.
  Matthew and David are happy, sitting naked and drinking soda. They kiss. Matthew spits soda on Dano's collarbone in fun. Dano does the same. The tension is gone. They are so happy together.
  The video ends with Alex, Daniel and Antoine walking close together along the beach. So happy. They run down the beach.

Starring Johan Paulik, Dano Sulik, Alex Petersen, Antoine Korda, Mikhail Paleki, Matthew Anders, Daniel Valent, Darren Thompson. All the men are intact.

Filmed in Casa Amigos, Algrave, Portugal.

Bonus is the Photo Gallery.

Beautiful work by Mike Esser and location photographer Lee Tucker. The atmospheric music and slow-motion camera work draws you into the sexual action and makes you wish you were there too.
Don't we all wish we could have a summer like this.

7923283,1,B00004U0LZ,"This movie is a disappointment. It is basically a soft porn movie (which I am surprised it is being sold.) There is a narrator. There is no story, just a lot of beautiful bodies with short hanging appendices. There are 6 guys, all friends, it is supposed to be their last day together. This movie is for the ones who are into beautiful naked bodies. There is one couple who does hardcore sex. The others are just hugging, kissing, and oral sex. The sex scenes are covered because the movie will be rated differently.",1201910400,2,516,4.5
7923284,4,B00004U0LZ,"Everybody loves Johan, but this video doesn't represent his finest moment on film.  In fact you might save your money and buy instead the saucy compilation ""Moments with Johan,"" which features probably the best clips from SUNSHINE AFTER THE RAIN and also five or six other movies as well.  What's wrong with a bargain?  However, if you're into this film for more reasons than just the one (watching Johan) you might find plenty of reasons to kick back, make yourself a stiff drink, and spend just over an hour watching the action of this puzzling film.

Perhaps in days to come there will be a restored version of the movie that explains what the plot is supposed to be.  As it is, you have the jacket copy on the back cover that says this is supposed to be happening all on one day to a bunch of schoolmates who have worked together and played together, and this is their last fling.  That explains why some of the gorgeous European youth are crying tears of regret.  The missing reels might add in actual scenes in which you could tell who each bright god is supposed to be portraying.  Otherwise they're running around like 7 or 8 Tadzios (from DEATH IN VENICE), with nary a strawberry mark to distinguish them.  No, I can't say that.  One or two of the boys look  positively swarthy, not quite as blond, and another one looks as though he'd sorted out what he wants from life now that he's reached the ripe old age of nineteen.  He smirks through the softcore as though he'd rather be making the big bucks in something like THE APPRENTICE with Donald Trump.

You'll know the one I mean when you watch the video.  Anyhow I can heartily recommend this to anyone interested in the 90s star Johan Paulik, who was sort of like the Josh Hartnett of Prague, only without Josh's ever so slightly daring note of rebellion or possible danger.  In Bel Ami terms, Johan was their superstar and I don't think they have ever really recovered from his turning into a man.  SUNSHINE AFTER THE RAIN doesn't really show anything, but that's okay, after all, erotica's all in the head, isn't it?  A few of the young pups on display, frolicking on the beach or on divans went on to careers elsewhere, and some I guarantee you will never see again on screen or off.

Now back to my eternal search for the missing reels of SUNSHINE AFTER THE RAIN.  Let others search for the footage cut from Orson Welles' MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS, I will follow Johan's traces.",1127433600,5,2440,4.517084282460137
7923285,1,B00004U0LZ,"The boys, especially Johan, are gorgeous, certainly to drool about. But there is really no storyline, to keep one's imagination working. The boys may be beautiful with adonis ... bodies, but simply pretending in doing something hot. That's it -- pretending. So one cannot really get much from watching this movie except perhaps to wish that it were real. Were it not for Johan, I would definitely give this movie a 0 rating, a ... and waste of time, watching Queer as Folk is much, much better.",991612800,4,494,4.689655172413793
7923286,5,B00004U0LZ,"The atmospheric story of the last holiday a group of friends will have together. Eight gorgeous young men star in this masterpiece of eroticism.
Take seven young men, as close as friends can be. They grew up together. They've shared everything together. They've loved together, as family, friends and lovers. But now it's time to enter the grown-up world. At the end of this summer, they'll all have to go their separate ways. It'll never be the same again, and they know it!
To say goodbye to their youth and their closeness, they spend a week together at one of the guy's villa in the sun. Sunshine after the Rain focuses on the last day of this holiday - the day deep feelings peak and raw emotions are let loose in a frenzy of heated passions.",973728000,14,747,4.5
