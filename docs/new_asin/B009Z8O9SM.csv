8545617,3,B009Z8O9SM,"To say I was surprised by the flat, uninspiring direction of the animation in this TV special is an understatement.  I understand that TV productions have a more restrictive budget than theatrical features, but really!  The previous year's special (2011's ""Eternal Mermaid"") was vastly superior to this.  Add to that some of the most unattractive character designs I've seen in a while, and this is not something that you watch in order to be awed by quality anime.

Storyline-wise, this is all right.  It's not great, but it's not bad, either.  While the tenuous connection between a lost page from the journals of Marco Polo and the history of Musashibo Benkei (a 12th century Japanese historical figure) seem a bit contrived, it's still watchable and entertaining.  Characterisation is good, the humour is fun, the action, while marginally animated, is decent, and pacing, while not as good as a number of other Lupin III productions, is not bad. All in all, I'd say this comes off as a very mediocre film.  Purchase at your own peril, as it may not be worth the price of an import blu-ray.

Speaking of import, do not assume the region-free feature on this disc implies any content in any language other than Japanese.  This is entirely in Japanese (including the threadbare extras that consist of TV trailers only), and if you don't speak/understand the language to at least some serviceable degree, do not waste money on this movie.",1402185600,,1438,4.8806584362139915
