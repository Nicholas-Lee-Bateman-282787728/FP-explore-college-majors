8203068,5,B000RY61NE,"This video surprised me with the extent and variety of professional pad training techniques and skills covered in this four disc set. I believe EVERY fighter ( MMA, Martial Arts, Boxing, Self-Defense, Street Survival, etc. ) trainer should know and master this material. If you are a trainer, coach, teacher, or mentor, and you can master the drills covered in this dynamic video set, you will have all you will ever need in the way of comprehensive mastery of the real ART of pad training. Anything not covered in this video set will eventually come to you instinctively when your neuromuscular system is ready for them, and when those you train will lead you into drill variations that are direct enhancements of what these four DVD's cover. A truly great product for the trainer or fighter who wants the absolute BEST in pad training knowledge. My hat is off to The Pad Man!",1350950400,,877,4.738562091503268
