837937,2,6304267967,"In several of the entries in the ""Prime Suspect"" series Helen Mirren, as Detective Chief Inspector (later Superintendant) Jane Tennison and the writing have richly deserved all the accolades that have been heaped upon them over nearly twenty years, but that unfortunately is not the case here. This is the only entry besides the first that was written by the series creator Lynda LaPlante, but the writing is extremely weak. This time, Tennison is trying to uncover the truth about a gay pedophilic ring that involves murder, molestation, and child pornography, and all the gay characters Tennison interviews are either delicate victims or monstrous predators (or both). Everything seems lurid and sensationalistic. The director, David Drury, made the ghastly  choice to have a boy's choir pipe in incessantly every time Tennison's detectives come across one of the young street hustlers, as if we might forget that innocence has been corrupted. We are also treated to such cliches as fluttery drag queens and menacing AIDS-infected children who inflict deadly bites on the detectives; and it's no good excusing all this by chalking it up to the attitudes of the times, because by 1994 LaPlante truly should have known better. The stereotyping of gay characters is so excessive that in the first episode I knew that there'd have to be at least one suicide attempt among the gay characters: there are no less than three of these, and since two of them seem wildly telegraphed ahead of time in Tennison's immediate proximity she seems like a terrible detective. And she doesn't seem much better as a boss, either, this time around. Usually Tennison must contend with both superiors and subordinates constantly undermining her authority because of her gender, but though her superiors are genuinely out to get her again, here Tennison's underlings seem to be doing the best they can, even though they're constantly being barked at by her for everything imaginable. If you hadn't seen the previous entrants in the series, you'd just think she were just an unpleasant crank.

Mirren, normally an unimpeachable actress,  seems to have been done no favors by Drury who allows her to engage in all kinds of distracting bits of ""business,"" like chomping away at her nicotine gum like a house afire to show her distraction and anxiety. David Thewlis, who is also equally talented, also gives a performance that is all tics as the nasty street hustler who is Tennison's prime suspect in the murder of an underage rent boy, and purses his lips over and over again when being interviewed by Tennison and her staff. It's impossible to believe that either he or Ciaran Hinds (here, flat and dull) could deliver any of the menace or charisma needed to keep so many young victims in line. The other actors fare much better, particularly James Frain as a sweet-sad molestation victim and Peter Capaldi as a nervous drag queen. They, and the machinery of the plot, are really all that keeps this production afloat.",1183420800,17,2995,4.986

First, the quality of the PBS tapes was very marginal, very dark with significant volume control problems (volume running from a silent feature to deafening when left to run).

838405,4,6304267967,"Actually this review is for parts one and two.

After the first hour the words that continually came to me were ""Superb Acting!"" This was largely because the quality of the acting was so good that (for me) the story seemed real.

That said, this tale is not for the frail at heart. While I have had some issues with the nature of the stories included in Prime Suspect, this one was (by far) the most challenging and I got goose bumps so many times (largely in unconscious response to the filthiness of some of the characters) that, by the end my skin hurt.

If that is not enough, there is more than enough sorrow to go around as you (begin to) contemplate innocence lost, lying, stealing (reporter), adults seeking sexual pleasure at any cost, etc. In the end, it just makes you (actually me) sad and, although I appreciate greatly the acting, I will go to bed tonight in the hope that none of what I watched will carry over into my dreams. (It has served as a reminder of the many vulnerable children who are regarded as prey to those who are wicked. It's something I need to remember and pray about.)

Complicated, well written story filled with realistic characters and tons of sorrow.",1409270400,,1189,4.4907407407407405

Mirren's personal life takes an interesting twist.  The quality continues in this season.

Edward Parker Jones is the villain who is Head of the the Advice Center.  He is running a child molestation ring and Superintendent Jane Tenneson is onto him.  This episode is well worth buying and seeing over and over again and again.  Three cheers for my favorite character Vera.  Vera is a must-see.  Helen Mirren's acting is at it's height in Prime Suspect III. Ciaran Hinds who plays Edward Parker Jones does an excellent job at playing a very bad man.  But he is just one of many men who are involved in these heinous crimes against young boys.  It goes all the way up the ranks of the police department.

This is an extremely well written, acted, and directed show.

The Prime Suspect shows always have an interesting case to solve and each show involves you in the life of Tennison. Tennison grows older in a realistic manner and her life and character change accordingly.

839381,5,6304267967,"I have all seven Prime Suspect films in their HBO-produced DVD release, which replicates the original UK broadcast language and technical quality. (Yay!) Why? I consider this series to be on the same plane as The Sopranos in quality, style and substance. It gets brought out regularly for viewing because of the compelling story lines, intriguing characters, fine ensemble acting, and Helen Mirren's multi-layered development of her character, DCI (later Detective Superintendant) Jane Tennison, as she matures during her long career.

Full disclosure: I too was a female who worked hard and struggled for decades to be promoted within a traditionally male profession, long before women became accepted and respected members. So, Jane's professional competence and occasional brilliance, workplace struggles and personal failings resonate with me.

IMO Prime Suspect 3 is the best but most disturbing film in the series. It's not for everyone. This is the very dark and graphic depiction of the abuse of disturbed and homeless boys by pedophiles who have operated unchecked for years, and of one underage male prostitute's murder that threatens to expose the coverup of some high-ranking officers' complicity and crimes. Tennison's dogged pursuit of Connie's killer is the only uplifting thing about this sordid subject.

What truly distinguishes PS3 is a plethora of brilliant and unusual guest star turns. In particular: Peter Capaldi as an empathetic gay drag queen; Ciaran Hinds as an oily operator of boys shelters; David Thewlis as a savage prostitution ring recruiter; and Tom Bell as an old-school detective and Tennison's one-time nemesis. IMO the casting directors for this entire series were geniuses, but they outdid themselves in this episode.

In my view, PS3 may be too rough an introduction for the first-time viewer of Prime Suspect, but the entire series should not be missed by people who enjoy watching intelligent crime/action programs. I also think that like The Sopranos, Prime Suspect episodes are best appreciated when seen in chronological order. So is Ms. Mirren's work as Jane Tennison.

The mystery is uncovered slowly, which is good, but the uncovering of the mystery happens in fits and starts, which I felt inferior to the steady pace (with a final surprise discovery) a good mystery should have. We know long before the end whodunit, but have to spend a third of the movie undoing the coverup. Thus the last third becomes a different kind of movie - more like a legal case. While that isn't bad, I think the change from requires a shifting of the viewer's expectations while following the plot.
I also felt that the authorities-are-hiding-the-truth aspect was depicted as indecisive, which detracted from suspense, a needed attribute.
Having said all that, the acting was well done - a standard for the series. The internal departmental wrangling and backstabbing were true-to-life, thoroughly believable, and the best parts of the episode. And the ending was credible.",1203724800,2,943,5.090322580645161
839384,5,6304267967,"This probably is the most unusual review I will ever write.  I watched Prime Suspect 3 years ago, and I thought it was a terrific police drama with an intricate plot and as always a commanding performance by Helen Mirren and the supporting cast.

But I don't think I will watch it again for decades because the subject matter is so profoundly ugly.  In a nutshell, DCI Jane Tennison investigates a horrific murder of a ""rent boy"" (underage male prostitute) who is found burned to death.  In her inquiry into this sordid world, Tennison finds evidence of something even worse than this sort of human trafficking...a secret ring of pedophiles preying on young runaways.

There is nothing particularly graphic visually, but the subject matter is something that I think most people would find profoundly unsettling.  I'm not condemning the makers of this Prime Suspect installment because police officers like the fictional DCI Tennison sometimes have to walk in the sewers of society and see all the ugliness that is down there.  For being willing to do that and keeping the sewers from overflowing into ""decent"" society, I salute them.

I just think that this particular story makes me think of a Russian poet who liked to write beautiful poetry about profoundly ugly and disturbing topics.  He called it, ""plucking the flowers of evil.""  I think that this Prime Suspect story is an example of that...a terrific story with great acting about criminal behavior and human conduct that is sickening to put it mildly.

So if you aren't easily haunted by disturbing ideas and the grimmest facts of life, you will find this a great police procedural.  I just know that I won't be watching it again for a long, long, long time ... if ever.",1191628800,5,1730,4.827118644067797
