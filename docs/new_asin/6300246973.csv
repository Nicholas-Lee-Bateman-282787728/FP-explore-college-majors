272595,5,6300246973,"Bus Stop is Mister Logan's  alternately sweltering, chilly and beautiful adaptation of William Inge's unforgettable stageplay, featuring Marilyn in one of her best film performances(aside from Huston's The Misfits) as naive child woman Cherie, a roadhouse chanteuse, a rotgut glamour girl from the wrong side of the tracks, who becomes the object of obsession for an equally infantile rodeo rider, Beau(Don Murray in an oscar nominated performance).Logan brings Inge's world to breathing technicolor life, and makes it all his own, bringing the bizarre couple from point A to point Z, from juvenile passion and hindrance to mutual love and affection. A fascinating work,containing some of film's most beautiful color closeups, a companion peace to Logan's other Inge adaptation PICNIC, both on the dynamic of man and woman and love.",1000425600,7,832,5.449612403100775

Don Murray sets out with Arthur from their Montana ranch to go to a rodeo Don has entered. When they arrive Don discovers Marilyn singing in a cheap bar and falls for her.  Don keeps after Marilyn to try to get her to marry him,she is determined not to.  It,s fun from beginning to end to see how Don makes out with Marilyn.",997574400,2,494,4.23404255319149

272602,5,6300246973,"In the 1950s, when Broadway was in its heyday, William Inge wrote a number of wonderful stage plays including BUS STOP and PICNIC.  Several of his plays were developed into screen plays and turned into films. In those days, film-stage adaptations gave those of us who lived in the hinterlands access to the New York theater.
The film BUS STOP is more ""staged"" than PICNIC the film, and much more dependent on dialogue. All the action in BUS STOP takes place in a few settings including a Montana bus stop, but if you appreciate clever dialogue you won't be disappointed.
Don Murray plays a young man who was orphaned and raised by a friend of his father who is the foreman of the ranch Don inherited on his father's death. Don has spent his whole life living on his ranch and all he wants to do is smooze with horses and cattle. One day, his mentor-guide-friend-foreman suggests since Don has ""come of age"" i.e. reached manhood, he needs to broaden his scope, get out in the world and maybe even marry. The two plan a trip to the big city (Helena in the 1950s?).
In the ""big city"" Don's mentor exposes him to many things--shops where he can buy new duds, city food, and city night life which consists of a visit to a local honky-tonk/saloon where the fabulous Cherie (Marilyn Monroe) is playing. Cherie is a woman with a past, a long, long past.  She's about the same age as Don, but she is much more worldly.  Don, who has seen few if any other women, thinks she is the most beautiful girl in the world and he falls for her in a big way.  He decides he wants to marry her and take her home to the ranch. She wants no part of this ignorant young cowboy whom she thinks is drunk or crazy, but the earnest young Don will not take no for an answer.  Through a series of misadventures, Cherie, Don and the foreman-friend end up stuck in a Montana bus stop in a blizzard--where most of the ""action"" takes place.
Cherie is still in her costume from the honky-tonk (she left her dressing room under duress) and plenty cold since her outfit leaves little to the imagination. It mostly consists of a bathing-suit like covering which accentuates Marilyn's charms and a long train which Cherie calls a tail. Marilyn spent the whole movie in this outfit and I think it is in a costume museum somewhere. As Don hops back and forth around Cherie, trying to persuade her to come with him to the ranch and be his wife (the foreman-friend who heartily disapproves of Cherie has already told Don he must let her go), Cherie yells ""Stop stepping on my tail.""
BUS STOP is not an action tale, it is a love story, so women will enjoy it more than the men (well maybe). Don Murray was perfect for his part--the naif, and Marilyn was perfect as the jaded young honky-tonk singer. If you like 1950s stage-screen plays, stories with a country-western theme (right out of a Merle Haggard song), and lots of good dialogue, this is a winner. And, anyone who thinks Marilyn was a dumb blonde better guess again.",991958400,9,2981,4.442413162705667
272603,5,6300246973,"What a great movie!  Don Murray is perfect in the role of Beau and Marilyn Monroe is, well, awesome.

She is touching, beautiful, sexy - she's got it all.  The rest of the cast is excellent as well, but you'll remember the 2 leads forever.",978912000,15,389,4.133333333333334
272604,4,6300246973,"We've got to admit that this kind of material belongs to the theater. However the casting of DON MURRAY in a real far out character and MARILYN MONROE as a dancer works surprizingly well. The saloon scene with MARILYN singing the 1942 MERCER classic THAT OLD BLACK MAGIC is fun. The fighting match in the snow is a real audience rouser. Perhaps one can say that the character that MURRAY plays seems rather unappealing and rather unbelievable. To resume the story simply, it's a youngman from the country who becomes a man when he discovers sex the first time he sees CHERIE.",978566400,11,575,4.647058823529412

272693,5,6300246973,"This is  one of the great films of the 1950's. It captures something real  about male-female attraction. It's also a  time-capsule of the period. The way the rodeo parade is shot, with cutting to Marilyn and Don Murray in the bleachers, is a small gem.  Ignore the corny scenes involving the campy gal who owns the bus-stop diner and the strapping bus driver, which seem to intrude from an earlier film era- say the late 40's. The  lead characters, Monroe and Murray, are both excellent, natural, believable. The battle of the sexes seems more deeply felt, even when played for laughs, than the dreary, sour, vulgar portrayals of ""relationships""  that crop up in movies nowadays. There are echoes of D.H. Lawrence here, as well as The Taming of the Shrew. (But with an  out-of-control male learning to appreciate and submit to the female, rather than the other way round!) Murray's scenes with Monroe at the end are  touching, leading up to the great cinematic moment- both sexy and poignant- when she puts on his fleece-lined leather jacket. The only role where she is this  good is in The Misfits.",1475452800,,1099,4.772486772486772

272739,5,6300246973,This is a great Marilyn Monroe movie. She does a great job playing a hillbilly from the Ozarks trying to work her away across the country to Hollywood. Don Murray is wonderful playing the cowboy who has spent his life on a ranch away from most everyone. He meets Marilyn and decides she's the one he should marry and goes about it all wrong with hilarious results.

272742,5,6300246973,"This is Marilyn at her best.  Working with Josh Logan as director turned her inside out as an actress.  Having a theatrical background as Logan did, , I believe, allowed Marilyn to literally shimmer on the screen as a doppelganger to her real life frailty and issues with men.  This is a bit creaky at times, but her performance and the raw newness of Don Murray turn this film into a invigorating, but sometimes uncomfortable look at femininity in the fifties, ultimately brought to our attention by the shimmering (look at her angelic camera shots)  presence of Miss Marilyn Monroe and her  insecurities and humanity.  This was her shot at theatre, and she is free and unyielding.  One of my favorites.",1463011200,2,704,4.768595041322314

272745,3,6300246973,"No question men, many men anyway, of my fathers generation, those who fought their way through the dregs of the Great Depression of the 1930s and sloughed their way through the various theaters of World War II thought that Marilyn Monroe was the cats meow. Was the epitome of what we would today call hot. Certainly in an age which saw the rise of the busty full-bodied calendar girl which graced many GIs lockers and then the explosion of a mainstream girlie magazine like Playboy which helped her career immensely one would be hard-pressed to name an actress who met the fantasies of more guys from that generation.

Me, and while I won't speak for my generation I think a lot of guys would agree with me, favored the softer sexuality of somebody like Julie Christie but that is just generational preferences. It took me a long time to not totally dismiss Ms. Monroe as anything but a face and figure until I saw her in the recent past in Some Like It Hot which showed her real comedic talents and then in the great if ill-fated The Misfits. She was still not the kind of woman who would keep me awake at night but an actress who could act more than just fill the screen with a busty figure and ruby red lips.
Of course for some men, some men like Bo in the film, the cowboy rancher from the lost planet of Montana, played by Don Murray, Cherie, Ms. Monroes role, the sight of seeing that pathetic nightclub singer whom he ran into heading west was something to keep him up at night. Keep his untutored school-boyish notions of dating and marriage on edge. And many an adult male in the movie audience back then would have liked to rope her in no questions asked.

Here is how love played out in this one. Bo, an ace cowboy, his true enough skill, was all set to set the world of the rodeo on fire with his skills. All set too to discover girls despite his advanced age of twenty-one as a result of leading sheltered life on the ranch. So he and his trusty companion set off for Phoenix by trusty transcontinental bus to the rodeo which will win him his fame. Of course the rodeo, like the carnival, like the gambling towns, has its fair share of distractions. In this case Cherie, a torch-less torch-singer seen in flash got Bo all riled up. Got him thinking that he could rope her in just like those calves he has been roping for years. (He might literally have believed that from some of his antics. Antics which would rate very high on todays politically incorrect meter, mostly rightly). Cherie, a girl who whatever her lack of musical talents had been around the block more than once, did not know what to make of the kid cowboy. Mostly she spent her time trying to keep away from the grabby Bo.

After winning almost everything there was to win in the rodeo Bo decided that he needed one more trophy, Cherie, who at best was lukewarm about him and his silly country ways (herself from the country well-versed in such foolishness). So he kidnapped her, took her on that forlorn bus back to Montana. Along the way the got stalled by a blinding snowstorm where Bo and the bus-driver finally have it out about leaving Cherie alone to do whatever she wanted. After being wailed by that bus-driver, sufficiently chastised Bo apologized for his misbehavior to Cherie and they part ways. Well not quite part since now that Bo seemed like he was not an escapee from an institution she saw where he might not be such a bad guy after all. And maybe the big sky country wouldnt be so bad after all for a rolling stone like her. A cotton candy plot but enjoyable enough even if Ms. Monroe was/is not your cup of tea.",1462060800,,3612,4.42042042042042

272757,4,6300246973,"It's a bit dated with some very chauvinistic behavior on the part of Don Murray yet still a great film.  All the actors are terrific in this movie, especially Marilyn - she gives an excellent performance as Cherie in this film.  Marilyn was as talented as she was beautiful.  This is based on a William Inge play from over 60 years ago - a very prolific playwright in his time (he wrote Come Back, Little Sheba).  As a film this works, never saw Bus Stop on the stage.  It is also amazing what is accomplished in this 94 minute film that others movies cannot do in 2.5 hours.",1458000000,2,575,4.287037037037037
272758,1,6300246973,"I can't imagine the size of the bribe necessary to snare newcomer Don Murray a 1957 Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for one of the most ridiculous and forced caricatures in film history. As a hayseed rodeo participant (and hyperactive suitor of Marilyn Monroe) in the turgid and vastly overrated Bus Stop, Murray's ""Beau"" left me slack-jawed and dumbfounded over his charmless 200 decibel performance that re-wrote the playbook for scenery chewers everywhere.

Twenty minutes in and his ham-boned overacting torture chamber became the Hollywood equivalent of fingernails on the blackboard demanding a desperate stab at the ""mute"" button or a sharp object impaled directly into my eardrums.

Apparently, his take on the immature, calf-roping phenom was to yell ""YEE HAW,  LITTLE LADY"" at maximum volume and repetition until the generously medicated Ms. Monroe (who could blame her) agreed to marry him after one ten minute interlude in a Phoenix saloon. The script, the story and the acting in this dismal slice-of-lifelessness is pure one-dimensional hokum, making me wonder how prevalent government-sponsored hallucinogenics were in the 1950's to generate the type of positive notice that allows this dreary film to exist as a minor classic to this day. It should be noted that Murray was subsequently beaten to death by a vengeful group of primates in 1973's Conquest of the Planet of the Apes. I'd say justice was served.",1457913600,5,1431,5.240174672489083

She knew exactly how to present her character in the helpless, but knowing what she wanted in life person. It takes a lot of guts overpower the sex goddess that she was known as, but at the same time, you could still see the talent she had within her. She is appreciated more now in death unfortunately, than in life, and at the end when she tore up her map in the picture, she exhibited what she really wanted out of life. To be appreciated and loved by anyone and everybody. However, the public just wanted her to play the sex kitten and knowing this, Marilyn Monroe gave them what they wanted.

273144,1,6300246973,"The play ""Bus Stop"" takes place in a (spoiler alert!) bus stop. The makers of this film obviously didn't think too highly of their audience and feared making a movie set in a bus stop. So they waste our time at a rodeo, at a dive bar, at a hotel room, on the bus, etc. Sure, a film can look for other locations to take advantage of the fact that it's not trapped on a stage, but this one goes so overboard that the script from the play has to be chucked out the window, whole characters are gone, and little remains but the title.

Too bad Hitchcock didn't make it. He didn't shirk from setting a film in a lifeboat, so a diner wouldn't have given him any jitters.

Nobody brings in anything close to a must-see performance. Add that to the fact that the script isn't there, and this film can be shelfed for all time without anything missing from America's cinematic history.

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: 'Bus Stop' marked a turning point in the career of Marilyn Monroe, at last allowing the iconic blonde the chance to spread her wings and test the waters as a bona fide actress. Her enthusiasm and dedication to her craft are evident in every frame of director Joshua Logan's liberal adaptation of the hit William Inge play, which through no fault of Marilyn Monroe never quite lives up to expectations. Sweet and tender one moment and grating and tedious the next, the film tells its flimsy tale in a pedestrian fashion, wisely favouring character over plot. A host of memorable moments, most of them subtle yet wonderfully affecting, are contained within, but can't lift the film to the level to which it ultimately aspires.

As Marilyn's Monroe's popularity skyrocketed during the early 1950s, the sexy star grew tired of the vapid roles she was arbitrarily assigned in comedies and musicals, and repeatedly petitioned 20th Century Fox studio chief Darryl F. Zanuck for more challenging and colourful parts...without success. Following the success of 'The Seven Year Itch,' Marilyn Monroe refused to play another ditzy dame in the idiotic How To Be Very, Very Popular and happily went on suspension, trading the Hollywood hurly-burly for a quieter existence in New York City and much-publicised stint at the famed Actor's Studio, home to such acclaimed Method actors as Marlon Brando and Montgomery Clift. She returned to 20th Century Fox after months of diligent study, and with a new, lucrative contract in hand, to make 'Bus Stop,' the first film mounted in part by her own production company.

The vehicle is a good fit, as it taps into elements of Marilyn Monroe's own personality, allowing her to draw from her own experience, even if the far-fetched story never really rings true. The trite tale follows nave cowhand Beauregard ""Bo"" Decker [Don Murray] in his film debut and his relentless pursuit of Chrie [Marilyn Monroe], a third-rate bar singer with starry-eyed dreams of Hollywood success. While in Phoenix for a national rodeo competition, the 21-year-old Bo is bewitched by the sexy chanteuse's ragged rendition of That Old Black Magic as well as her beautiful face and curvaceous figure and calls the flattered Chrie his ""angel."" But what seems to Chrie like a sweet puppy-dog crush soon evolves into a full-blown obsession, as the hyperactive, delusional, often obnoxious Beauregard 'Bo' Decker stalks, and then literally lassos his lady love,  hoping to browbeat her into marrying him. ""You have a terrible habit of overdoin' everything!"" Beauregard 'Bo' Decker's devoted pal and father figure Virgil Blessing [Arthur O'Connell] screams at him, but Bo won't listen, and when his brutish tactics backfire, he and Chrie lock horns at a remote bus stop diner halfway between Arizona and Bo's Montana ranch. Whether Chrie escapes Beauregard 'Bo' Decker's clutches or succumbs to his charms forms the basis of the simple plot.

Adapted by George Axelrod, who wrote The Seven Year Itch and 'Bus Stop' nicely juxtaposes the raging hormones and impulsive, immature attitude of a wild young buck against the jaded disillusionment and vulnerability of his sensitive doe. As the film's trailer touts, Beauregard 'Bo' Decker  knows absolutely nothing about women, while Chrie knows far too much about men. Finding common ground is difficult, and as Chrie thoughtfully confides to her traveling companion, Elma Duckworth [Hope Lange], also making her film  debut, ""I've just gotta feel that whoever I marry has some real regard for me...aside from all that lovin' stuff."" It's a line that surely mirrored Marilyn Monroe's attitude about her own life, just as Chrie mirrors Marilyn Monroe herself in many respects, a woman whom men treat as an object; whose body is valued far more than her mind; and who doggedly seeks respect and validation from the establishment. Chrie believes she'll ""get treated with a little respect"" in Hollywood, a fact Marilyn Monroe by this time knew all too well not to be true. Such similarities add extra poignancy and bitter irony to Marilyn Monroe's performance, lofting it high above many of her other portrayals.

And while her sensitivity and vulnerability grab the spotlight, Marilyn Monroe is too smart to completely subdue her overt sexuality. In the scene where Beauregard 'Bo' Decker barges into her bedroom, she's obviously naked under the covers, just as she was in 'Niagara' three years earlier, and her rendition of That Old Black Magic brims with flirty abandon. In fact, a sultry air permeates the entire film, which treats the subject of sex with a refreshing frankness, especially for the mid-1950s. Shots of Beauregard 'Bo' Decker frolicking in the bathtub and admiring his shirtless physique in the mirror, as well as the subplot involving the diner owner, Grace [Betty Field], and her casual physical relationship with the transient bus driver Carl [Robert Bray] further spice up the film and nicely balance Marilyn Monroe's allure.

Joshua Logan also employs extreme close-ups to great effect late in the picture, heightening dramatic impact and the intensity of emotion between Chrie and Beauregard 'Bo' Decker. Yet how hard as the film tries, the romance between these two attractive  characters strains credulity. I've never seen or read the stage version of 'Bus Stop,' but I can't help but think it possesses more substance than the screen adaptation, which, like a lengthy bus trip, chugs along in fits and starts, without any rhythm or flow. Though the performances are all stellar, Joshua Logan was known as an actor's director, but his films remain largely undistinguished, despite their notoriety and success and they can't completely eclipse the loud, crass, tiresome story.

Blu-ray Video Quality  20th Century Fox has been doing a fine job with its Marilyn Monroe Blu-ray transfers, and 'Bus Stop' continues that tradition. The 1080p encoded image rendering is a nice step up from the previous standard-definition inferior NTSC DVD, sporting increased clarity, a cleaner image, more balanced colour timing, and a greater sense of depth. Though evident grain still remains, which preserves the film-like feel, the picture now flaunts a smoother look, and a reduction in brightness adds welcome warmth that augments the drama's intimate nature. The source material still exhibits occasional errant marks, but not nearly as much as the inferior DVD format and you really have to keep your eyes peeled to catch them. The single-strip colour exudes a surprising level of saturation and vibrancy, yet still maintains an appropriate natural tone. Though the blue sky might appear artificially enhanced, reds are bold and sassy and check out the tinted light that bathes Marilyn Monroe during That Old Black Magic, and the browns project a potent earthiness. Flesh tones from Marilyn Monroe's heightened alabaster complexion to Don Murray's outdoorsy tan, remain stable throughout, and deep black levels add appropriate weight. Close-ups, especially the extreme ones that dominate the film's climactic scene, can be breath-taking, showcasing both Marilyn Monroe's beauty and vulnerability, while background details, such as the busy wallpaper pattern in the hotel room and the crowd scenes at the parade and rodeo, are clear and precise. Fabrics are accurately represented, the chequered pattern of the diner uniforms resists shimmering, and no banding, noise, or digital tinkering could be detected. This is by far the best 'Bus Stop' has ever looked on home video, and Marilyn Monroe fans owe it to themselves to upgrade to this version only.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The sound on this Blu-ray has been upgraded to 4.0 DTS-HD Master Audio, and though the surrounds remain pretty quiet throughout the film, the full-bodied track possesses fine presence and pleasing tonal depth. Some nice stereo separation across the front channels is immediately evident and succeeds in widening the soundscape, and the robust, country-tinged music score fills the room well. Ambient effects, such as the noise from the rodeo crowd and rowdy bar patrons slightly bleed toward the rears, and some decent bass frequencies come through, especially when the cowboys are riding bucking broncos. A wide dynamic scale keeps distortion at bay, and dialogue is well prioritized and always easy to understand. Best of all, no hiss, pops, crackles, or any other age-related imperfections rear their ugly heads. Though not a flashy track, the 'Bus Stop' audio nicely complements the film, and you can't ask for much more than that.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Theatrical Trailers [1080p] [2:25] The only extras on the disc, unfortunately, are the film's Theatrical Trailers, which includes: Bus Stop, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, How To Marry A Millionaire, Niagra, River Of No Return, The Seven Year Itch and Irvin Berlin's There's No Business Like Showbusiness. Surely there's some old Turner Classic Films of Marilyn Monroe with retrospective behind-the-scene stuff and interviews that 20th Century Fox could have dug up, licensed, and included here.

Finally, `Bus Stop' is often cited as the film that made critics sit up and take Marilyn Monroe seriously as an actor, and not just another pretty face and stunning figure. While Marilyn Monroe is good here, the film itself is an old-fashioned romance that leans heavily on 1950s morals and a sort of everyone-deserves-a-second-chance message, is nothing special. The film's brand of folksy, home-spun comedy hasn't particularly aged well, and co-star Don Murray is progressively more and more grating as the yokel cowboy who practically hog-ties Marilyn into romantic submission. Minus the lack of special features, 20th Century Fox's Blu-ray release is stellar and all of the films from their Marilyn Monroe series have looked wonderful, but `Bus Stop' is only a must-buy for the biggest fans of the iconic bombshell. Most of the time I love most of Marilyn Monroe films, but this film does not quite hit the button for me, and it is something I cannot quite explain why I feel this way about this film. I have tried to like it, but for some unknown reason the characters don't quite get the full potential out of the characters or relate to them and sometimes the acting seems a little stiff, but overall, don't get me wrong, I do love this film and I am sure glad it has now been added to my ever increasing Marilyn Monroe Blu-ray Collection. Highly Recommended!

273317,4,6300246973,"Bus Stop is the wildly underrated story of two young people at a crossroads (both figurative and literal) in their lives. She is hustling from the Ozarks to Hollywood, and he is journeying from his native Montana down to Phoenix to become a rodeo champion. It also presents a powerful message on the growing feminism of the era and how it can coexist and even thrive within more old-fashioned ideas about gender roles.

He comes from a small town and has seen very few ""gals"" in his life. From the instant he sees Marilyn's character, he falls instantly (and foolishly) in love with her and decides to make her his bride. She is flattered by his chivalry while also fearful of it; having only known men as semi-abusive clients, she is unable to deal with men who treat her well.

This seemingly perfect pairing deteriorates as their journey continues; his once-chivalrous ways become obsessive and she regrets having accepted his courtship. She asserts herself by denying herself to him, seeing him as an obstacle to her Hollywood dreams. To deter him, she cites her past of having ""many boyfriends"" as a foil to his pureness and virginity.

This conflict inspires one of the best movie lines of the 1950s. He reassures her that her past does not reflect poorly on her or his feelings for her. ""I like the way you are, so what do I care how you got that way?""

The film is ultimately about compromise and sacrifice. Neither has exactly the future they had envisioned for themselves, but by the end they don't see it as a sacrifice but rather a new future just as promising as their original dreams.

A bus stop is a single point on a greater journey. It is a place of interaction, collision, and reflection. After all the action takes place though, the trip must continue, progressing ever onward toward a better place.",1369440000,6,1819,4.654205607476635
273318,2,6300246973,"I've known about Marilyn Monroe all my life, of course - have seen her portrayed in various movies and TV shows, but for one reason or another haven't investigated any of her movies until now.

I started with ""There's No Business Like Show Business,"" which I gave up on after half an hour, because it was so boring.  Then I moved on to ""Bus Stop,"" one of Marilyn's most acclaimed roles.  This one I watched all the way through, and I must say I'm astounded at how sensibilities have changed since the 1950s.

First of all, I do give kudos to Marilyn for her performance (the only reason for the two stars I gave the movie).  She makes Cherie a very layered and believable character, and I paid little attention to the ""sliding accent"" other reviewers have complained about.  It's the character of Beau I have issues with, and they are enormous.

Apparently, movie audiences in the 1950s had no issue with a cowboy on his first visit to the big city deciding that he's going to marry the pretty blonde showgirl - and then becoming violently abusive in his insistence that she return to his ranch and become his wife, a future Cherie strenuously objects to. Despite her having told him ""no"" over and over again, Beau decides it's a good move to abduct her and throw her onto the bus back to Montana, ignoring the protests of his older and more sensible friend.  Later on, during their stop at a diner due to a storm, Beau becomes violent towards another passenger who attempts to defend Cherie, and to his friend, all of which made me sick to my stomach.  All I could think of was, ""This won't end well - there's no way this could end well.""  Of course Beau becomes all soft whispers, apologies and promises, because that's what abusers do.  Behind the whispers, he wants what he wants and won't consider another point of view.  Just horrifying.

I wish Marilyn's portrayal of Cherie had been in a better, less stomach-churning movie. She's luminous, funny and woeful, hopeful and spirited. But I found myself wishing that Beau had been stomped to death by one of the rodeo bulls, so that Cherie would be spared a future as the captive wife of an abuser.",1368316800,10,2152,4.544041450777202

Of course she has always shown excellence in all her films, but this one is a step outside of the typical, ""sexy, funny blond"" character she played in so many of her films.

Its the only movie that completely removes her from her standard screen persona that she never completely escaped from in any other movie. But it is a crime that it is now the only major Monroe movie (well along with ""Niagra"") not released on blu ray.

The print of the film just looks a bit ragged compared to the wonder of the other Monroe releases in blu ray. Fox needs to package this with ""Niagra"" and the lesser ""Lets Make Love"" and make a second ""Forever Marilyn"" blu ray set.",1348876800,,623,4.417391304347826
273387,1,6300246973,"`Bus Stop' is one of those films that is largely considered the highlight of Marilyn Monroe's career.  She personally viewed this performance as her best and thought that it legitimized her as a serious actress.  While she was denied an Oscar nomination for her work (sadly, she never received one) maybe people feel that it was a serious snub looking back.  With that thought in mind, I decided to indulge last night and what I found was something far different than I expected.

I hated this movie.

My hatred for this film really doesn't have much to do with Miss Monroe, outside of her sliding accent, but her presence cannot overshadow the film's most eye-rolling of flaws.  Between the script and the ludicrous performance by Don Murray, this film sinks to a serious new low.

The film tells the story of a brash young cowboy who ventures into Phoenix to compete in the rodeo and find himself a woman.  He catches a glimpse of Cherie, a young caf singer with bigger dreams, and decides that she is going to be his bride.  He then bombards her with his company and forces her into his marriage plans even though she constantly puts up protest.  He then becomes a bully, yelling and screaming and accusing her of trying to trick him and he kidnaps her in an attempt to get her to his farm.  All the while, his older cowboy friend tells him he's wrong but really does nothing about it.  In fact, no one does anything about it while he's chasing her through the nightclub she works at or physically assaulting her at a bus stop, IN FRONT OF MANY PEOPLE.  It's such a bizarre film and the sad thing is that it is supposed to be taken seriously.  This isn't a comedy and none of this is played for laughs.

It's just stupid.

Murray gives a one-note disaster of a performance, hooting and hollering and acting like a buffoon throughout the entirety of the film until he has a sudden about face and actually delivers a sincere conclusion.  Until that moment, his performance can be described in one word; gross.  How he received an Oscar nomination for this is beyond me.  Monroe is decent here.  She gets the emotional depth of the character, but her accent work is semi-atrocious, and it certainly gets worse and worse as the film moves along.  I much preferred her in `The Misfits' and `Some Like it Hot' where she matched her emotional developments with an effortlessness that she loses here while she struggles to make her accept stick.  Arthur O'Connell is fine, but he's completely overshadowed by his abrasive screen-partner.

Overall, this is a mess.  It doesn't say much of anything and it doesn't offer much of anything either, outside of a sultry introduction shot of Monroe in a windowsill.",1346025600,10,2702,4.628151260504202

273459,3,6300246973,"Bus Stop, 1956 film

This movie was adapted from a Broadway play. It is set in the rural west of Wyoming by a big city playwright. [Two strikes against it?] A young cowboy who has lived his entire life on an isolated ranch goes wandering. He meets a young woman, Cherry, who lives in a small town and falls in love with her. [Are looks deceiving?] He wants to marry her, but she doesn't want him. Watch the movie to see how that works out.

There is the usual amount of drama and personal interaction, comedy from misunderstandings. You get to see parts of a traditional rodeo in the western states, which celebrates working skills (rare today). Marilyn Monroe shows her acting skills, like the others. Does this story seem far-fetched? Was the original Broadway play bowdlerized for Hollywood's audiences? Does the need for a happy ending contradict the earlier story? Believable?

The idea of a young woman from show business marrying a rancher and living in rural isolation was part ""Of Mice and Men"". It didn't work out so good.",1312588800,,1032,4.69060773480663
273460,3,6300246973,"Years ago I watched part of this on tv & fell in love with the idea of Marilyn Monroe falling for a cowboy against her will as he pushed his way into her heart. I hadn't seen the beginning of the film & I didn't get the chance to see the end. Later I found this on netflix & rented it. Boy was this film different than what I thought it was.

This film is quite possibly horrifying. Don't get me wrong, this was well acted & at times this was pretty cute (the ""oh, HONey..."" scenes are my favorite). It's just that the over-reacting by Bo was just horrifying. Initially his reaction could be seen as cute or comedic but as the film progresses his actions became increasingly over the top to the point where it could be seen as abusive in many different ways.

I think I finally stopped rooting for Bo & Cherie when he started shouting at her in the bus stop & manhandling her in an attempt to force her to do what he wanted. There just wasn't any way of sugarcoating his actions at that point. (I kept getting visions of him marrying her & later treating her the same way, possibly getting more abusive.) This film just needed more give & take to the interactions between them. It would also have been nice if there had been more softness shown to Bo throughout the film. Rather than showing him to be a guy with no social graces he just came across as a bully.

I think where the film failed to hook me is that it tried too hard to walk the line between romantic comedy & drama. Instead of choosing one or the other it went halfway & didn't really fully accomplish either. I've heard that the source material came from two different plays (with the actual Bus Stop being quite dark indeed), so I think this was just a case of trying too hard to please two different camps.

This wasn't an overall bad film but it just fell short of what it could have been. The ending was sweet but it just didn't ring true with all of what came before it.",1302566400,7,1940,4.206989247311828
273461,2,6300246973,"""Bus Stop"" was made in 1956 and the best part is watching the bus start off from a Montana ranch.  The movie is over 50 years old and did not have the feel of meeting expectations.  I had heard Don Murray was up for an Oscar and that Marilyn won a Golden Globe for this.  My expectations were high, especially since I had just seen Marilyn in ""Some Like It Hot"" and lifted with laughter between her, Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon.

However, ""Bus Stop"", the movie, treaded water, and personalities were over the top.  I cringed at the histrionic personality of Cherie (Marilyn Monroe) and the ""aw gee"" cowboy buck named ""Bo""(Don Murray) that treats Cherie like a calf to lasso and haul back to his ranch in Montana.

The story centers around Bo, the young rancher, rodeo rider who falls in love with a ""been round the block"" cafe singer, Cherie.  He wants to marry her the minute he sees her and after the rodeo forces her on the bus back to his Montana Ranch.  Cheri tries to escape this ardent admirer but he just does not give up.  The only part I laughed at was when he promised her new kitchen appliances, washer and a sink.  It was the only laugh I had. Marilyn is OK in this movie, her acting is fair-she is trying hard to make it funny - and the close up glamour shots show off her shimmering golden beauty, but that is not enough to hold one's interest.  Bus Stop also stretches the mind about the ""Phoenix"" location - if anyone knows Phoenix, that is not Phoenix.",1299110400,2,1470,4.328467153284672

This was the movie debut of both Hope Lange and Don Murray. Edw. G. Robinson Jr. has an uncredited cameo as a rodeo cowboy.

Marilyn Monroe's superb performance as an Ozark Mountain gal working her way due west to Hollywood is compromised by a single script flaw. Off-key saloon singer 'Cherie' has for a couple of days been terrorized by yahooing Montana cowboy 'Bo' Decker (Murray), who blew into Phoenix to appear in a rodeo. After just meeting Cherie, Bo loudly insists she will marry him and live on his ranch. He even kidnaps the poor girl at the bus station when she tries to get away from him.

They arrive at Grace's remote Rocky Mountain diner (an ""official"" bus stop) in a blizzard. Cherie begs all who will listen to free her from her captor. Carl (Bray), the chivalrous bus driver that considers himself captain of his ship, challenges Bo to a fistfight. They go at it in the storm and Carl whales the tar out of Bo, who eventually gives up when he's caught in an unbreakable wrestling hold.

Cherie first watches their fight from inside Grace's and then goes in the cold to beg the two men to stop. Her dread of Bo has suddenly turned to sympathy at the sight of him getting beaten. When Bo, as preface to saying goodbye the next morning, apologizes for scaring heck out of her, ordering her around and abducting her, Cherie melts like an ice cube in a hot frying pan and coos that ""I would go anywhere with you now.""

Shrinks would have a field day analyzing the behavior of these two. What sort of message did this send in 1956 to young women seeing the film with a date? He can mistreat you, boss you around, make you go where he wants, do what he wants, as long as your boyfriend/husband apologizes every so often for being a total ogre? Feh.

This turn of events is certainly no fault of the actors playing out Inge's ultimately insensitive and perhaps misogynistic  plot. Everyone did a wonderful job in their roles. Kudos all around. As for Cherie and Bo, one can only hope that both survive a marriage forged on the quick and under rather dubious circumstances.

There never has been nor never will be anything like her--mountains of imitators, some spending millions to advance their own careers have not come close.

The story is OK but not very convincing.  No one could possibly be as naive as Beau, who sees a half-clad bleached blond untalented singer in a sleazy bar and thinks she is a virginal angel. Not even in 1956.

Don Murray is a little over the top, which works in a farce but not a comedy.  There's a difference.  But Marilyn Monroe is excellent as Cherie, and I'm no great fan of Miss M.  The rest of the cast is sufficient, although I don't know why some of them were included at all, except to fill up bus seats.  Still, this isn't a bad comedy romance.

273490,3,6300246973,"Marilyn Monroe was nominated for the Golden Globe award for Best Actress for this 1956 film adaptation of William Inge's play.  As Cherie, she is beautiful and plays a character from some small town in Arkansas where guys started pursuing her when she was 14.  From a perspective 50 years later, some of the acting seems a bit over the top, but it played well in its day.

Don Murray plays the ranch hand Bo who wants to force Cherie to marry him.  Murray earned his only Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor in 1956 for the role.  Today, his style seems too animated to be believable.  However, he certainly performs with gusto.

The supporting cast is also excellent.  Robert Bray who was in ""The Caine Mutiny"" plays Carl the bus driver who gives Bo a licking.  Arthur O'Connell who had two Oscar nominations for ""Picnic"" in 1955 & ""Anatomy of a Murder"" in 1959 does a good job as Virgil, Bo's buddy that tries to counsel him.  Betty Field plays Grace, the cafe owner with a strut out of ""Annie Get Your Gun.""  She has appeared in ""Picnic,"" ""The Great Gatsby,"" & ""King's Row.""  Eileen Heckert with her deep voice plays Cherie's friend Vera.  Heckert was nominated for the supporting Oscar for ""The Bad Seed"" in 1956 and won in 1972 for ""Butterflies Are Free.""  She does an excellent job of grounding the film with a sense of reality.  Hope Lange puts in a brief appearance as Elma Duckworth who works at the diner.  She's lovely in a small role.  The following year, she would get a Best Supporting Actress nomination for ""Peyton Place"" and go on to win hearts in the 1960s in TV's ""The Ghost & Mrs. Muir.""

273492,5,6300246973,"Marilyn Monroe in Bus Stop gives one of her greatest perfomances; her comic timing is everything and she employs it to the hilt here. Also, her ususal attention to details and to gestures, is strongly in evidence.

At one point Marilyn puts on a sheep skin lined leather coat, a very worn coat, helped, and she does it in such a way that you would think it was a Black Glama ranch mink coat..perfection.

Her makeup, always here white, for ""songs"" in the ""show.""  Her close ups, generously given by Joshua Logan clue us into certain moods she has about the cowboy(Don Murry) determined to marry her. There are the songs..Marilyn bought her own costumes for this film, and made sure they were from a rental agency and were very worn. Her rendition as Cheri of ""Down Down I go"" is not be believed..play it over and over and see what she does.

Many more details: when marilyn gets out of the cold into the Diner, watch her warming up top the stove, as if to a lover...it goes on, and it is gl;orious.

Brava Marilyn and the entire cast, and, J. Logan, the director, for yet another William Inge manifestation on the screen, that other being Picnic.

The reviews that say this is dated are unaware of the many reviavls of this play, and their dismal results. Also, see a Kate Hudson film, or Reese Witherspoon, or Sandra Bullock film for bad comic timing, terrible scripts and awful photography, and are they into thw itmnes in which we live?

Marilyn Monroe was not just an ""icon"" of the ages; she had an enormous talent, largely unrecognized.

A time or two, such as in How to Marry a Millionaire, Marilyn seemed to strike gold with her penchant for humor, but those moments are rare, and you won't find them in this film.

Cherie spends the entire movie fretting over her lot in life with a high-pitched whine, and her cowboy lover hollars and brawls until you want to knock them both over the head.

The supporting cast isn't too exciting either, and costume design is stingy. Marilyn goes back and forth between a fishnet horror and a leather skirt throughout the entire movie.

The only parts of the movie I really enjoyed were the rodeo footage and the scene where Beau finally gets the tar beat out of him by a fellow traveler.",1180051200,6,884,4.411042944785276
273494,3,6300246973,"Bus Stop was an oddly entertaining and touching film. At first glance, the picture appears relatively dumb and unrealistic, and too be honest, the acting was a bit canned (even for Marilyn), but upon closer examination, all of those elements end up having a touch of genius. You begin to realize that the acting was supposed to be that way (Marilyn's bad singing and overly dramatic acting and Don Murray's over the top exuberance), and that they are done very well. Don't forget that this is really a stage production. What strikes me most is the love story that develops in the end and it is very touching, given the metamorphosis that the cowboy goes through during the picture. Also, Marilyn's willingness to downgrade her looks (from Blonde bombshell to a hillbilly lounge-singer) and deliberately sing poorly in the only song of the film, was very brave and ended up working very well. All in all, this is a cute love story to watch with your wife or girlfriend and will leave you with a good feeling in the end.

  To contrast this film with the quintessential Marilyn, watch the Seven Year Itch or Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, the latter being her best movie of all time (despite what most people think of Some Like it Hot).",1178150400,6,1229,4.680555555555555

273536,1,6300246973,"I watched this yesterday and I'm still in shock.  Monroe began to ripen as a dramatic actress just mere days (it seems) before she died.  For sheer hilarity and dramatic weight, she never surpassed her role in ""Some like it hot"".  For dramatic power she was very impressive and powerful in ""The Misfits"".  This film, earlier in her career has been hailed as an early dramatic performace.

I am not familiar with the play from whence this film came from.  I just watched it and took it for what it appeared.  I found Don Murray's characterization of the cowboy to be a negative distraction, largely because instead of a real person he came across as a living comic-book character.  There was not a moment when he was on the screen except for his quiet moments of remorse at the end, when he was not sounding like a lunatic.  Other commentators have noted that this over the top performance was supposed to be this way, deliberatly to be funny.  Well, in my time, at the end of 2006, this type of behaviour looks stupid, ridiculous and unbelievable.  Further, Murray spends almost every second in the film shouting at the top of his lungs as if this is the way most cowboys fresh off the farm act when hitting the big city for the first time. Ahhhhh, no: I don't think so.  The director (Logan) must have encouraged him to act this way and for me it makes him look like an imbecile.  Honestly, his acting just made me so uncomfortable from the beginning to the end I wish I could have stopped the film.

Then we have Monroe.  She looked as she always does, beautiful.  But, I did notice that she kept changing the inflection of her voice, as if not quite yet sure of how to morph from a blonde-bombshell-dimwit into a real person, a dramatic presence.  She just comes in and out of the ""place"" and it strikes me now as quite a fascinating moment in her career, almost at the cusp of breaking out into better acting.  Her attempts at an accent come and go and if we were not so distracted by what she looked like we'd take closer note of it.  Her skin looked so white next to the cowboy that she almost looked sickly.  The best moments were when she was staring into a mirror (very well set up shot) and the doubts and fears that crossed her face felt every bit as real as one could imagine.

All in all I was shocked at how bad the film looked, given the age in which we live.  The cartoonish characterization that Murray gives just looks ridiculous and hence hard to relate to.  I just could not imagine any cowboy acting like a wild baboon on steroids.  Sorry, but this just made me cringe.  You compare a great dramatic effort like ""The Misfits"" and the contrast makes everything clear.  If Joshua Logan wanted to make a drama here then he destroyed it with the creation of a character right out of the comic ""Bizarro"".  This film just does not age well.",1166659200,18,2855,4.388571428571429
273537,4,6300246973,"A year after his success with ""Picnic"", director Joshua Logan held the reins for another film adaptation of a William Inge play this time adapted by comedy veteran George Axelrod. The 1956 result is a far more rambunctious and comic story than ""Picnic"" but no less dependent on rural stereotypes to inhabit it. The slight story focuses on a dim-bulb, no-talent singer named Cherie (pronounced by her as Share-REE) who tries to avoid the advances of horny rodeo cowboys in a cheap Phoenix dance hall. However, Cherie is hardly an innocent as she is not above hustling unsuspecting cowboys out of their money to fulfill her dream of getting to Hollywood. Enter Beauregard Decker, ""Bo"" for short, a loudly energetic, self-confident but thoroughly nave young buck. He is in town to not only win the big rodeo competition but also find himself an ""angel"". Once he sets his eyes on Cherie, he is convinced she is his angel and manhandles her to marry him. The rest of the story is really about his pursuit as Cherie tries unsuccessfully to escape from Bo's persistent efforts, and it all ends up in a snowbound diner on the way back to Bo's Montana ranch.

Kim Stanley played Cherie to great acclaim on Broadway, but it's safe to say Marilyn Monroe makes the role her own. After a brief break from the screen when she went to New York to study at the Actor's Studio, Monroe threw herself into the part with raw vulnerability and instinctive flair, something she would not replicate fully until her last film, John Huston's ""The Misfits"". It's sometimes a bit studied, but her work here is among her best. Monroe manages a poignant scene with a very young Hope Lange on a bus where she talks about what kind of man she wants, and her faux-pathetic, self-lit version of ""That Old Black Magic"" is classic. Don Murray does well as Bo, though the character gets so obstinate as to throw off the balance of the story. ""Picnic"" veterans Arthur O'Connell and Betty Field lend fine support as Bo's mentor Virgil and sassy diner owner Grace. Eileen Heckart is also terrific as Cherie's only friend Vera.

273538,4,6300246973,"There's one wonderful thing about this 1956 film.  It's Marilyn Monroe.  I have forgotten how special she was and how she dominated every scene she was in.  This was one of her lesser films.  And yet, her magic is there.

The plot is a bit hokey but it works.  Don Murray is cast as an innocent cowboy without any experience with women.  When he leaves Montana to compete in a rodeo, he meets Marilyn Monroe.  She's singing in a bar and has obviously had a shady past.  This doesn't matter to him, though.  He falls in love with her.  And, much to the distress of his sidekick, brilliantly played by Arthur O'Connell, he kidnaps his lady love and puts her on the bus with him going back to Montana.  She protests of course.  And when the bus is stranded in a snowstorm and everyone must spend the night in a roadside diner, the plot thickens.  It all ends happily, though.  And it looks like Marilyn and Don will live happily ever after.

There is nothing special about this film except for the nostalgia.  The screenplay is old fashioned and stilted.  The situations are predicable.  Also, once the theme was developed, we didn't need a dozen ways to develop it.  That said, I must say I enjoyed the film.  I had almost forgotten what 1956 was like.

273540,2,6300246973,"Inge's play takes a bit of time to grow on you, but there's a lot of depth to it, and it does a good job of showing many facets of love and loneliness.  The movie strips a lot of that out and ends up simplifying things to the point where it just seems hollow.  Many of the same emotional peaks are in there, but without anything in the story to give them context, they end up feeling false and overdone.

I think that a film needs to be taken on its own merits, so I'll spend a little time talking just about the movie.  But there's no review that says much about the play here, so I want to cover that as well.

I thought Monroe was pretty good in this.  There are moments where she was brilliant (the ""Old Black Magic"" song is a great piece of character work); watching this gives you another chance to appreciate how smart Marilyn actually was.

I thought the actors that did Grace, Carl the bus driver, and Virgil were acceptable (Carl the most so), but Bo was far too one-note a performance.  He had some great physicality for the role, which was nice, but the vocal work was grating.

Overall, the pacing of the film seemed poor, but that's somewhat normal with older movies, and I'll admit I probably was biased by knowing the play in this.

The restoration is excellent, I thought.  No complaints in the quality of the image.

Basically, had I not just done the play, I probably wouldn't have watched.  It was actually a bit stunning to sit through, seeing what a play that I really enjoyed had been morphed into...

The plot's the same, but the movie takes an hour to cover what a few expository sequences in the first act cover: the rodeo, why everyone's on the bus, and so on.  This really strips some of the tension from the actual part of the show that takes place at the bus stop; there isn't enough time to build it up.

If you liked Will the sherrif and Dr. Lyman the professor from the play, too bad.  They're completely gone.  Lyman had to go for 1950s sensibilities I suppose, but taking him out makes Elma a cutout character, almost pointless.  Virgil's changed; he's got a different focus, and that really dilutes his part at the end.  I always felt he gave the play a ""happy"" ending by actually answering positively the question of whether there still was love, sacrificial love.  You get echoes of that in the film, but just echoes.  And you lose a lot of the humor and character of Grace and Carl with the cleaning up of their relationship.  Grace becomes a skit character, channelling Mae West, and Carl ends up an amalgam of Carl and Will from the play.

In a nutshell, if you're going to be doing the play, do not watch this movie beforehand! Watch it afterwards with the cast, like I did last night.  It'll be fun, but in an MST3K kind of way.  Otherwise, unless you're a Marilyn Monroe fan, I'd probably skip it.",1101772800,8,2841,4.363809523809524

The premise of the movie is Beau, a young cowboy, going to a rodeo.  He's an innocent, never off his ranch in Montana.  He decides he's going to find himself an angel to take back home.  So he meets ""Cherie"" in a saloon.  He manhandles her, browbeats her, and eventually kidnaps her.  His screaming and fighting make a person think that if he managed to force her to marry him (after abducting her with a lasso as she desperately tries to flee), he'd probably force himself on her on the wedding night.  It's just that creepy.

So they end up stuck at a bus station together due to bad weather.  FINALLY someone steps in when they see Beau manhandling Cherie, and says he can't kidnap this woman.  Beau objects and ends up getting his butt whipped.

As Cheri, she gives a dazzling performance of 'Black Magic', and it's great listening to her in her hillbilly accent. The final scenes where her face take up the entire screen was great directing and she looked as beautiful as an angel. Her comic timing was delivered perfectly, and the costumes she wore in this movie lead to some of her greatest still photograph.
So why only 4 stars? The rest of the cast did a great job, Virg, Elma, Grace, and Carl. Who did I leave out? That's right, Bo. Don Murray single-handedly ruins this movie. His cowboy mannerisms are waaaay over the top, he overacts every scene he's in, he's rude, stupid, and to tell you the truth, Marilyn ending up with him is so unbelievable, it makes you just want to scratch your head.
Now I know that Bo was supposed to be an inexperienced cowboy right off the ranch, but no one is going to arrive in a city and acts like he owns the world. Kidnapping a woman (with a lasso of all things) and dragging her on the bus is a stretch, but when Bo finally gets his butt kicked by Carl, and learns a lesson in humility, and then Marilyn falls for him, well... I can't believe someone would give up their Hollywood dreams and go to a ranch with a doous like Bo.

Bo though wants to find himself an angel.  However, the conversation takes a bit of a chauvinistic tone from the green and inexperienced Bo, who is headed to Phoenix to compete in the rodeo.  Says Bo, ""That steer this moment--he didn't wanna get throwed, did he?  Well, I throwed him.  Some wild horse you borke in, he don't wanna be broke, do he?  But you don't let what he wants stop you.  So what makes you think a gal's gonna be any different?""  To paraphrase Virgil in a more contemporary way, ""Houston, we've got a problem.""
Bo's other problem is that he tends to overdo everything.  He does pushups in the bus, to the surprise and annoyance of the passengers and bus driver.  But the worst flaw in his character is that he has no manners.  As the bus driver asks him later, ""Were you born in a barn?""  Well, close, as he has been isolated on a ranch all his life.
At the Blue Dragon inn, Bo finds his ""angel,"" a much put-upon singer named Cheri.  He falls so in love with her that he announces to a stunned Virgil, and more than stunned Cheri, that he has found his girl and is going to marry her tomorrow.
Cheri herself has a long string of boyfriends and lovers, something that the naive Bo is unaware of.  In her opening scene, when she's resting on the window sill, she is instantly harassed by rowdy cowboys pawing at her, and then by the manager.  She's clearly not lived a happy life, but she does have a dream to go to Hollywood.  What she's longing for is to be treated with respect, hence her identifying herself as a chanteuse and reminding Bo that her name is Cheri, not Cherry.
Eventually, Bo's faults come to a head at the title place, where he gets a much deserved lesson.  I'd find Don Murray likeable if his characterization of Bo wasn't so obnoxious.  I detest rude people sans manners and loud, whooping cowboys, and unfortunately, Bo is both.  While his meanings are noble, it's the way he does it that caused me to flare in exasperation.
Arthur O'Connell is a relief in this picture as the wiser and more maturer Virgil.  Virgil gives the fatherly patience and love to Bo, exasperated, angry, and hoping that his young friend grows up.  In the scene where Bo gets his comeuppance, he generates a ""this is gonna hurt me more than it's gonna hurt you"" atmosphere.
This is Hope Lange's debut film as Elma, the young girl on a trip to a concert.  The woman to woman talk between her and MM in the bus is a standout.  And Betty Field stands out as the diner owner Grace, a woman with an Eve Arden-ish sense of humour.
Some trivia in this picture.  Marilyn had issue with Don Murray, because of his relative inexperience, and she asked for Hope Lange's hair to be dyed a darker shade of blonde, because after all, MM was THE star.  A bit of ego there.  And the younger LIFE magazine reporter is Casey Adams, who also came out in Niagara as Ray Cutler.  Also, this picture was the first with Marilyn's new acting coach, Paula Strasberg, utilizing Method acting.
While this film is generally touted as the one where Marilyn finally could act, I take issue.  Marilyn was ""acting"" way before then, from her B+ acting in Don't Bother To Knock to her compassionate blonde goofball in The Seven Year Itch.  But if you take into account the strong backwoods accent of an Ozark hillbilly, then yes, her acting is definitely good, but nothing Oscar-worthy here.",1075334400,6,3550,4.477449455676516

Gone in this film version is Dr. Lyman and his resurrection in the hands of the neophyte Elma. Gone too is the sexual dynamics of bus driver Carl and the lonely Grace. The setting change from Kansas to Idaho loses so much of the midwestern heart that drives Inge's central narrative.

Grace's Diner is where bus driver Carl ends his frustration with Bo and decides to fight him to stop him from his angry fit once he discovers Cherie was trying to escape. After a knock down, drag out fight, Bo comes to his senses and apologizes to everyone for his unruly uncontrolled behavior, but mostly to Cherie. Cherie sees the sweet side to Bo and sees that he really loves her. She decides to board the bus to Montana, along with the wedding ring invitation.
In conclusion, Bus Stop is worth seeing for Marilyn, if nothing else. Her acting and singing are so-so, but her unmatchable sweetness is worth your time!",1066176000,3,2122,4.613756613756614

273598,5,6300246973,"Many critics now say that it's a crime that Marilyn Monroe was never nominated for an Academy Award. Her not being nominated for her performance in ""Bus Stop"" is proof.
Today, we often see actors starring in movies that require them to speak with a certain accent, and their accents come-and-go during the movie. You won't find that here. Marilyn's hillbilly accent remains throughout the film, and it's a very realistic one. Initially, Marilyn's costume was an expensive getup created by the studio, but she herself went to a second-hand shop and found an outfit that she believed her character would actually wear. And, she agreed that she should wear the white, chalky make-up that she does in the film, as her character is one who sleeps during the day (never sees sunlight) and works at night.
Marilyn displays a wide range of emotions in this film--happiness, sexiness, sadness, excitement, and downright anger--and we feel every one of them. I don't think any other actress could have done a better job in the role.
The entire cast is excellent as well. The role of ""Grace"" is a scene-stealer!",1037145600,36,1100,4.8563829787234045

273652,5,6300246973,"BUS STOP proved beyond a doubt that Marilyn Monroe could indeed act.  For those who missed her 1952 performance in DON'T BOTHER TO KNOCK, the surprise was very pleasant indeed.

BUS STOP was adapted from William Inge's successful long-running Broadway play, and was bought by Fox with Marilyn in mind.  She plays the role of the ambitious cabaret singer Cherie, who longs to go to Hollywood, where, she assures her waitress girlfriend (Eileen Heckart), ""you get discovered, you get tested, with options and everything!  And you get treated with a little respect, too!"".

Enter naive cowboy Beauregard (Don Murray in his screen debut) , who falls in love with her during her performance of ""That Old Black Magic"" (which must surely count as one of Monroe's most beguiling screen moments).  Uneducated hick that he is, he decides to marry her, come hell or high water.

The film has been fully restored, using the original YCM masters to replace the parts of the film that were too far-gone to be rescued.  A pristine picture with a gorgeous soundtrack.

The DVD includes restoration comparisons, gallery and trailers.  Available seperately or as part of the Marilyn Monroe Diamond Collection.",1028678400,9,1191,5.030612244897959

I consider it to be probably as bad as Disney's 'Gnomemobile' from the 70's or an episode of Barney the purple dinosaur.  Yes, I really think this movie is that bad.
There are no likeable characters in the whole movie, Marilyn sounds like a complete idiot.  Don Murray's character has to be the most disgusting, unbearable character ever. More disagreeable than Jar Jar Binks.
When I watched Mission Impossible 2, I felt like I was mugged of my time and money, but the movie was beautiful in its own right.  Bus Stop has no redeeming qualities at all.  It's poorly acted, poorly shot, poorly edited and atrociously written.
This one goes on the bottom of my pile of cruddy movies, right next to Videodrome.",1023753600,10,823,4.533783783783784
273655,5,6300246973,"I am a long time Marilyn fan...BR>One can imagine my excitement when I found out about this awesome collection of some of Marilyns' movies on dvd...  I had always loved this film because Marilyn was in it, and it is her greatest performance on screen.  She was amazing in this, even if the storyline is sometimes corny and just downright silly.  Marilyn makes this movie so watchable.
She had taken a break from 20th Century fox before she made this, and after taking classes at the famous ""actor's studio"" in NYC, she formed her own production company.  I think her whole way of acting changed after these ""method acting"" classes, and ""Bus Stop"" was the first production to showcase this.
As far as the dvd goes, it is so much better than it ever looked on television.  If you check out the extras you will get the chance to see a comparision.  To the naked eye, it is utterly amazing what work went into restoring the tale of Cheree' and that ol' bully cowboy, Beauregard Decker, played by Don Murray.
It doesn't have as many extras as ""The Seven Year Itch"", which is the best of all the MM dvd's, but it's worth owning just to be able to see Marilyn at her finest work.
Marilyn really got into this role.  I remember reading that she would stay in her hillbilly ""chanteuse"" character off the set, and it drove the rest of the crew crazy.  That pasty white complexion, that hillbilly accent, and those little costumes of hers were all just brilliant additions to the outstanding, brilliant acting work that she does in this.
""Bus Stop"" is mostly dramatic but has some true comedic momments thrown in, and it's also another movie she sings -- ""That Ol' Black Magic"" is sung by her in that lilting drawl, whilst she self consicously pushes her straps back up on her costume.
As much as I love this movie, I didn't love Don Murray.  It was his first film.  While he was sometimes funny, he often annoyed me, but maybe it was the way you were supposed to feel about his character.  She makes it perfectly clear to him that she isn't going to marry him, but he does everything in his power to get her.
Marilyn's Cheree' and Ol' Verge, played by Arthur O'Connell, were the most likeable characters in the film.
Eileen Heckart plays Cheree's friend.  There are some good character actors in this movie that help make it that much more entertaining.
It's a charming movie that will capture your heart at it's sweet ending. Sure, it has it's truly corny and utterly sacchrine sweet dialogue, but it's got Marilyn!
A MUST FOR THE TRUE MM FANS!!!
For anyone who's never seen any of her movies, this is the one to watch, she is at her peak here.  Even if she does look pasty..",1023062400,4,2666,4.483471074380165
273656,4,6300246973,"I was very impressed watching Marilyn Monroe's acting performance in this one.  Of course, she's still very hot.  Her saloon outfit is designed to basically put her breasts in individual containers for individual display...  So those that want to skip the acting part, this is still worth watching.
But Marilyn is given the chance to actually show some good emotions here.  OK, so she's playing a role where her job is to mesmerize men.  But what do you want, Marilyn Montroe in a concentration camp?  When we meet her, she is good at hustling drinks, but is kind of sick of the work.  When she finds herself attracted to someone with clean, if naive, motives, she is all of a sudden unsure of herself.
When she unintentionally leads a young hunky hayseed into thinking she'll marry him, then her troubles multiply.  At first she tells him to get lost once she realizes he's in over his head.  However, I guess the rules of 1956 allow a guy to drag a lady anywhere he wants to, even if it's against her will.  It's here she gets to show feelings of despair and fatigue coupled with the fact that she's not totally unattracted to him.  In my opinion, she does a good job acting like a female at that time would act.
The only bad part I had with the film is one that happens when theatrical productions get translated to film.  The actors sometimes feel they have to orate in theatre fashion, which means saying too much too loudly.  In the movies, you don't have to make sure the last seat in the theatres hear or see your facial expressions, so a little more sublety would have worked.  But other than that, it's a great period piece where you get to see a legend in a slightly different setting.",1017014400,3,1696,4.464285714285714
273657,5,6300246973,"This movie, with the exception of ""The Misfits"", probably says more about the person Marilyn Monroe was, then anything you'll ever read about her life. Her portrayal of the little nobody from nowhere, who ""keeps trying to be somebody"", is very touching and moving. But even though many comparisons can be drawn between Marilyn & ""Cherie"",that doesn't take away from the skill & subtlety she puts into her creation. This is a performance, and a brilliant one. And, as acting teacher Lee Strasberg said when reviewers accused her of ""just playing herself"",...""Playing yourself on screen is the hardest thing to do."" Anyone who thinks that Marilyn couldn't act should watch this movie. Director Joshua Logan said years later that he had the usual prejudices against M.M. that most of Hollywood felt towards her, when it was first proposed that she take the role that was originated on stage by Kim Stanley, in the play by William Inge. Logan writes, after recalling his statement that she couldn't pull it off because she couldn't act: ""I  could gargle with salt & vinegar even now as I say that, because I found Marilyn to be one of the great talents of all time."" He also later told of how many of the ideas for the role came from Marilyn herself, saying:  ""She was  brilliant, she was just uneducated."" Some may find this movie ""dated"" (so's the Sistine Chapel). There are no special effects or  blasting music to numb you into thinking you're having a great time. There's just a tremulous, wonderful, heartbreaking performance by an unforgettable screen presence, who, like ""Cherie"", just wanted some respect. She and Cherie both finally received it.",1016150400,5,1651,4.906810035842294

I have been a fan of Marilyn's since I was a child and this is one of the movies I never could see because of the fact that it was out of print and so difficult to find. My mother taped it off television for me and after hearing all the hype from other Marilyn fans, I simply had to see for myself! Marilyn was at her best here and she was robbed of a nomination that year for Best Actress. Marilyn, in her hillbilly drawl is a confused woman who instantly steals your heart and has you rooting for her to get away from Don Murray, espcially after waking her up after a few hours of sleep and dragging her to the rodeo! But he is persistant and all ends well after an angry bus driver tried to teach Bo (Murray) some manners!
Marilyn went all out in this movie, choosing her own costumes so that she appears as if she is a tired and wary saloon singer who just doesn't seem to have it anymore. And the ghastly white makeup was her idea. Not only did she play Cherie in this movie, but she WAS Cherie. With the memorable musical number, ""That Old Black Magic,"" this is an absolute must see, must have movie for any Marilyn fan.",1006041600,3,1149,4.133928571428571
273659,4,6300246973,"Long out of print (and undeservedly so), ""Bus Stop"" returns to the video scene and just in time for the current DVD frenzy.  Monroe is heartbreaking as kitchy chanteuse, Cherie, who's hijacked by a love-struck young buck played by Don Murray.  When Cherie performs ""That Old Black Magic"", she's her own floor-show in more ways than one.  Marilyn gives a nuanced romantic and comedic performance.  Her sex appeal is, as always, unstoppable.  But it's Cherie's heart (and Marilyn's) that seems stripped bare -- particulary in the key scene at the bus stop diner when the camera pulls in for an extreme closeup of Murray and Marilyn.  Anyone who can sustain that kind of luminous vulnerability under such intense focus is truly a screen legend.",1005696000,15,741,4.935483870967742
273660,3,6300246973,"Marilyn Monroe gave one of her better performances in this movie. Unfortunately, the movie itself is so lacking. This is especially true when you compare it to writer William Inge's stage version. The movie has completely deleted characters that were too controversial for '50s Hollywood. However, those characters make perhaps the most profound statements on the human condition that the movie loses the richness of the play. The only real reason to see this movie is if you're a fan of Monroe's work. Otherwise, find out if there is a production of the stage play in your area. If you're only knowledge of this work comes from the movie, you're missing most of the story.",1003190400,5,673,4.860869565217391
