It's pretty basic, which is what makes it useful.  The tape addresses each step necessary to make a quality swing. Although it's pretty slow paced, each step is clear.  For me, the section about swing plane finally helped me to grasp that concept. Given the limited number of teaching aids specifically for lefties, it's worth the small investment.",1365292800,,498,4.7011494252873565

7864806,5,6304168055,"Aultman is a great teacher, a former editor of Golf Digest, and gives tips that any golfer will appreciate.  He knows how to explain the reasons  behind the tips, so that you understand how it works.  I think it's perfect  for people who've gone stale and want to get back into improving their  game.
Since I'm not left-handed, I assume it's even better for lefties.",967161600,5,366,4.569230769230769
