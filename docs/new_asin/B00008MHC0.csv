1850971,3,B00008MHC0,"I've been doing Tae Bo for almost two years now; I started with the original 4-pack, gradually made my way through the Basic and Advanced workouts, and am proud to say that I can now do the Tae Bo II: Get Ripped DVDs (generally considered to be the most difficult in the Tae Bo series) without missing a beat.  Along the way, I lost 30 pounds and gained a ton of confidence.  Tae Bo is a fun and effective workout - if you're in search of a new program, look no further!

However, if you've never done Tae Bo before, I definitely do not recommend the Ultimate Upper/Lower Body for beginners.  This DVD features two 55-minute workouts, each of which is made up of clips from previous workouts.  As the title implies, one workout focuses on upper body work (i.e., arms), the other, on the lower body (mostly legs, with some ab work thrown in for good measure).  Both of the compilations tend to jump from move to move very quickly, with little explanation or chance for recovery.  As usual, some of Billy's instructions can be confusing or erratic, and the format in these ""best of"" DVDs exaggerates these flaws rather than eliminating them.  This is disappointing; you'd think that the editors would have chosen the best representations of each exercise, but they don't always.  These problems also plague the other ""Ultimate"" DVD, ""Ultimate Abs/Butt.""

Nonetheless, I love this DVD!  I'm less than thrilled with some of Billy's newer workouts - ever since he switched from Ventura Distribution to Good Times Entertainment, it seems like his DVDs have gotten more stylish but less challenging (e.g., the Capture the Power series).  Thus, I find myself hoarding as many of the old workouts as possible.  Luckily, Ultimate Upper Body/Lower Body makes a fantastic addition to my library!

The Lower Body workout, in particular, offers a steady yet challenging cardio workout, with lots of roundhouse kicks, sidekicks, knee raises, and squats.  You'll definitely feel this one the next day!  I'm not as impressed with the Upper Body workout, though; many of the punches are performed while you're balancing on one leg and thrusting the other foot to and fro.  Consequently, I find myself worrying more about keeping my balance than executing strong and controlled punches during these exercises.  Even so, the Upper Body workout really does work your arms!

An added perk of having split Upper/Lower Body (and Ab/Butt) workouts is that, if one part of your body is feeling especially fatigued, you can still put in a good workout without falling over from exhaustion.  As my arms become more muscular, and I put more effort into my punches, I find that my arms wear out more quickly than my legs.  On days when I can barely manage a decent punch, I just pop in the Ultimate Lower Body workout, since there's very little arm work involved.  I know Billy and the crew were probably just in search of a way to better maximize their profits when they pieced these compilations together, but the Best Of/Ultimate series definitely makes for an effective workout program, particularly in the long term.

In regards to the workouts themselves, I think the Lower Body deserves 5 stars, the Upper Body, 3.  Production quality and editing is less than stellar, though, so I'll have to knock 1 star off of the final average, bringing the rating to 3 stars total.  The Lower Body workout alone is worth the price, though, especially if you're starting to become bored with the Tae Bo DVDs you already own and find the newer ones a tad too easy.",1132531200,17,3527,4.7805280528052805
1850972,4,B00008MHC0,"The Tae Bo ultimate upper/lower body is intensive, energetic, and great fun.  You really feel your muscles working while you are getting an aerobic workout.  I can already feel the difference.  At the end of the session, you feel a fantastic sense of achievement.",1130284800,,263,4.931818181818182
1850973,5,B00008MHC0,Wonderful workout!  WARNING!  I think that you should definitely start out with the beginner stuff because this workout will kick your butt.  I love it and it really makes you sweat!,1127433600,,182,4.806451612903226
1850974,5,B00008MHC0,"I bought this dvd to complement my Advanced ""Get Ripped"" series-it sounded good to be able to focus primarily on one body part at a time for greater results.  I did the Upper Body workout yesterday & my back & arms are literally screaming for mercy today! This really took it to the next level- I'm looking forward to doing the Lower body workout soon.  I can see how this would shape & tone up your body quickly! I've been doing Taebo exclusively since the end of May and my weight loss & muscle tone are impressive.  I highly recommend these!",1121040000,3,544,4.366336633663367
1850975,5,B00008MHC0,"If you are someone who runs regularly and is looking to stay challenged, the Ultimate Lower Body Solution is going to take you to the next level. I am someone who does not want to waste time & money on a workout video that won't challenge my body, so I highly recommend this particular workout from Billy Blanks. This lower body workout is the first DVD workout I've experienced that can actually replace a power run. Enjoy the challenge!",1104105600,18,438,4.556962025316456
1850976,4,B00008MHC0,"Both the upper and lower workouts in this DVD will get your heart rate going and the sweat flowing.

The snippets of workouts are from various other tapes that Billy has already produced, which is why I gave it only 4 stars.  With a lot of the snippets coming from ""Get Ripped"" and ""Live"".  I own both of those series so it was a little disappointing to be seeing the same routines, however, it did give me assurance that both of those series are a great workout.

The leg workout is a killer while the upper body will leave your arms and shoulders screaming for aspirin.

Overall a great addition to my ever growing library of Taebo!",1094947200,25,634,4.384615384615385
1850977,5,B00008MHC0,"I actually like to do the upper body more.  Both workouts are equally intense and you work up a sweat within the first 10 mins or so.  Even if you don't have any taebo experience previously (I didn't), you can still keep up, just give it a few days and you'll get used to it! :)",1093305600,13,278,3.9464285714285716
1850978,5,B00008MHC0,"Now I am a HUGE Billy Blanks fan, but this was a huge disappointment. I ordered it for the Lower body excercise. There isn't much Lower body going on. It's a mash up of Billy's classes from different sessions. Most of them do not co-ordinate well from one work out to the other. I still worked up a sweat but it's too hard to follow. The video quality is why am giving it 1 star. Terrible! I only tried this dvd once, never again. I do not recommend.

UPDATE 10/11/15
So, obviously i prejudged this video without giving it a fair chance. The old grainy video quality threw me oof but now I can say, I  was wrong. Have been doing this fir 2 weeks straight and it's intense. Once you get past the different clips and get the hang of it, it's pretty good. Initially i gave it 2 stars but am.giving it now it's rightful props. 5 stars it is, am actually ordering a second copy , just incase...has both lower body and upper body.  Love it!",1384300800,2,934,4.206703910614525
1850979,5,B00008MHC0,"Ultimate Upper and Ultimate Lower Body are compilation dvds complied from the Get Ripped II series circa 2001 and the Live series that came out the next couple of years.  Along with the original advanced dvd (which is not part of this compilation), the classes Billy put out during this time are considered by Tae Bo aficionados to be his best and most difficult.  Please note the production value is basically a class filmed on video and the since it is a compilation it can at times be choppy but you should be working and sweating so hard that these things should not matter.

There are two primary workouts and two bonus add-ons.  The bonus Ultimate Abs is five minutes of floor ab work. I think this one is the only real misstep on otherwise perfect dvd since it is little fast and too short for serious ab workout. Ultimate Butt is 5:10 of standing Butt that could be added to the Lower Body if you are glutton for punishment.

Ultimate Upper Body - 52 minutes - this is a cardio class with focus on continuously moving arms the whole time.  There is the standard 5 minutes warm-up and 2 minute stretches and then for next 33 minutes (38 if you count warm-up) you do cardio with punches, speed-bags and other arm combos.  At the 44 minute mark you go down on floor for push-up series for two minutes and then 6 minute cool down.

Ultimate Lower Body - 47:31 - You start with the first 9 minutes of Ripped Workout One and then for 42 minutes you kick, kick and kick some more with some horse squats and holds thrown in for good measure.  This is all standing and it you are true Advanced you could throw on some ankle weights for truly killer leg workout. You cool down at the 42 minute mark and you will need it.

Again great old school tae bo for fans of the Ripped Series or those newer to Tae Bo who want more advanced classes but are not bothered by old school production values.",1381795200,2,1889,4.340909090909091

1850981,5,B00008MHC0,"I've had a couple Taebo workouts over the years and always enjoyed workouts that aren't too much like an aerobics dance class. Taebo is one of my favorite work outs for that reason. This DVD, in particular, is really good...can't wait to see and feel the results!",1370563200,,263,4.617021276595745

1850983,5,B00008MHC0,"I bought this DVD because I absolutely LOVE Ms. Deason's Pilates for Weight Loss DVD.  I've had it for years and became long and lean in a matter of weeks only by using it daily.  It's amazing.
Now on to this DVD review.  This is definitely a great workout.  Using the balance ball per Ms. Deason's instructions really allows you to tone and firm your core not to mention strengthen all kinds of other muscles you can't work out during conventional exercise/weightlifting.  Form is everything.  If you do the exercises right, the way she tells you to, you will feel it working in muscles you didn't know you had!  When you tighten these smaller accessory muscles, you will create a firmer and leaner body.
Ms. Deason is a genius, really.  I can definitely say she has quite a grasp on anatomy and physiology, and implements sound science to create results.  I mean look at her!  She's fit and graceful.",1323734400,,902,4.616352201257862
1850984,5,B00008MHC0,"I love Billy Blanks and this is one of his best...there are two workouts, upper or lower body. I can only review the upper body workout because that's the one I do all the time - best upper body workout there is. Unlike his earlier videos, he makes sure to tone all different muscles throughout your upper half (a little ab work as always). Since you're not using any weights, you tone without bulking up, which is what we women are always aiming for.

Really gets you sore in the best way!",1184371200,,490,4.326086956521739
1850985,5,B00008MHC0,"I bought this set several years ago to add variety to my Taebo workouts. I am a long-time Taebo fan; I have an active family and it keeps me in shape for the other sports that we do together. The routines on this dvd are challenging at Taebo's typical advanced level and excellent for focusing on a specific portion of your body. For example, if I want to get my legs in shape for biking or skiing, I'll do the lower-body workout. On the other hand, if I have already been biking, my legs have had a good workout, so I'll do the upper-body routine (I use very light weights for resistance). You could also alternate between them to focus on your whole body. However, if you're only going to purchase one set, I'd recommend the Get Ripped Advanced series instead of these.",1158278400,,771,4.398601398601398

1850987,2,B00008MHC0,"This tape was a bit of a disappointment to me.  I've been doing Tae-Bo since the beginning (remember the motivating info-mercials?)  As my wedding was approaching I wanted to kick it up a notch from the original Basic and 8-minutes workouts that I've been doing for so long.  After reading all the reviews from this website, I chose this DVD.  Having now tried to use it several times, I am most disappointed by the editing- there are several exericises that are performed on one side of the body but then not repeated for the other.  The editing is also choppy enough that it interrupts the energy and flow you can build during a workout.  It is disappointing enough that I am now trying to find an alternative DVD, or even a copy of the original ""Advanced"" workout.  Hope this helps!",1140048000,9,785,4.564285714285714
