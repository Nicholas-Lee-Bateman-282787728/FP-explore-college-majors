8503830,5,B006SW1PFI,"I was debating whether to write the Sekai Ichi review given this series doesn't have an ""official"" DVD boxset, but I think I'll do it after all since I'm in the Sekai Ichi mood.

I'll say it right now. Sekai Ichi Hatsukoi is superior in almost every way to Junjou Romantica despite being a spin-off. Sekai Ichi takes place in the same universe so characters from the previous yaoi show are mentioned or make small cameos and while Junjou Romantica focuses on different couples with the common theme is most of them are in the English major. Here EVERYONE works in the manga industry no exception. And the best part is that the details of how to make a manga is VERY accurate (given how Nakamura works in this very industry and goes through the same crap that everyone else does). If you didn't know this was a yaoi series, you would think its a comedy, slice of life (which this series applies to more than Junjou Romantica). Additionally, the theme of this story is very important and very true.

""There is truth in what people say that first love is one of the most important relationships in a person's life. For better or for worse.""

This series takes this statement and runs away with it as fans like me have noticed that the first love is the most important (but its usually the SECOND love that makes the characters happy but that theme applies to Junjou Romantica series more than this one). So while we're given a better series overall and the better couples, we're also given the WORSE couple ever in yaoi series that makes me hate being a yaoi fangirl and disappointed about how many fangirls defend the pairing.

Nostalgia: The main pairing of our story is about Ritsu Onodera and Takano Masamune. 10 years ago, Ritsu confessed his love for Takano during high school and they went out. However because of miscommunication and misunderstandings, the two had a horrible break up. Shy and innocent Ritsu has become a cynical tsundere in the present time trying to apply to the literature department to get away from the hate from his co-workers who accuse him of riding the name of his father's name. By bad luck, he's assigned to the shojo manga department instead where he meets his boss Takano (yes the same one from 10 years ago. What luck right?). They are off to a rocky start with the clashing personalities and its not until later does Ritsu realize that his boss is the same person he dated during high school. With all honorifics because of his boss, Ritsu drops it immediately showing how bitter he still is about his first love. Takano (who also suffered just as much as explained later in the series) who is the one that recognizes Ritsu after getting past his tsundere personality that the old Ritsu has swears that he'll have him fall in love with him again as he never forgot about their love (and made it perfectly clear that he never mocked their relationship). It's to be noted that as the series goes on, Ritsu seems to be hiding more things than Takano about what really happened and while most episodes are in his POV (except the last one), Ritsu REALLY has selective memory of what happened. So overall, this couple ends up being the belligerent sexual tension couple with the jerk with a heart of gold clashing with the tsundere and compared to Misaki and Usgai, you CAN feel their love for each other no matter how much they fight or are in denial.

Domestica:...This is the pairing I wish never existed. Worse pairing ever. Between Chiaki Yoshino and Hatori Yoshiyuki, I just want to strangle them both after what they did in their last episode featuring them. Basically, the plot is Chiaki is a lazy but famous manga artist that goes under a female name because he doesn't want his fans to know that he's a boring guy in real life. Hatori is his childhood friend editor and often has to get Chiaki to work. Chiaki also has another childhood friend Yuu Yanase (who out of the three, is the best character and the only reason to watch Domestica) who works side by side as a free lancer. Chiaki thinks that Hatori is in love with Yuu seeing the two fight often and he thinks his suspicions are confirmed when he sees Hatori kissing Yuu in the rain (what was this scene about?! The series NEVER elaborates what happened which is not a fault of the series but of the author.) Anyway, Chiaki gets a little jealous and then goes to sleep because he caught a cold because of the rain...and then he wakes up to Hatori making out with him and then proceeds to rape him brutally. Yep. This is why I hate the pairing.
a. A love triangle where you sympathize with the third wheel who is the most sympathetic of the three. (No seriously, Yuu is very sympathetic. While he can be a TROLL at times, he is very considerate of Chiaki's feelings and is the friend in need unless Hatori is concerned. The series is very cruel to him and literally slaps the idea that the childhood friend that cares for you more cannot end up with you because of the rapist).
b. Chiaki is the stupidest uke ever written. You cannot sympathize with him because of how dim he is and to add to that Chiaki becomes a huge jerk as time goes on in the series as seen with his relationship with Yuu being strained. EP 10 is the beginning of his stupidity, EP 15 is pushing it and then by EP 16, he's dead to me (and literally most of the fanbase).
c. Hatori is a -gasp- a yandere THAT GETS AWAY WITH HIS CRIME. I take it back when I say Shoko and Kaede are the worse yandere. Hatori is by far THE WORSE YANDERE EVER (he's worse than Yuno in terms of possessiveness). So basically, he's a yandere character that gets to brutally rape his childhood friend (the anime tones it down to just a kiss but the novel he clearly rapes him and there's no fanservice when Chiaki is screaming at Hatori to stop) because Hatori thinks Yuu got to Chiaki first and makes the first move by raping him, and then later destroys the friendship Chiaki has with Yuu as the series goes on and GETS AWAY WITH IT. Semes get away with a lot of crap in yaoi series but this is unforgivable as he should be arrested for his crime. And fangirls have the nerve to say Chiaki ENJOYED being assaulted by his best friend or deny it ever happened and bash Yuu for being in the way of their relationship which DOES develop into Stockholm Syndrome. This is seriously the Twilight of all yaoi pairings.

Erotica: My favorite pairing and the most stable pairing of them all (next to Trifectia that is not animated yet). Kisa Shouta (get it shota?), Ritsu's co-worker that sits right next to him, is one of the oldest members of the manga industry but has the babyface to make him look the youngest. Kisa admits that he's a man whore that sleeps with guys with pretty faces and has never been in a committed relationship as a result. (Yes people, Kisa is one of the first ukes that actually experiences and enjoys sex compared to his inexperienced seme parter). Kisa ends up falling in with Yukina Kou of the sales department because of his prince appearance. Kisa ignores this attraction until one of his former partner that he slept with comes and attacks him during the store (and we get a scene that shows how awesome Kisa is as he's not afraid to tell the guy to **** off in public. Yukina ends up saving him and the two slowly start seeing each other until Kisa realizes that he's falling in love and tries to cut ties with him (and its revealed that he suffers from low self esteem and he's a very depressed individual that is implied to have fun with other men because of how he feels like he can't do anything right) but Yukina's persistence starts their relationship.

Yes...and obvious bias toward Domestica but if you skipped all the episodes concerning them, then you'll in for one of the best yaoi series out there in terms of realism. Believe me, I got a lot of my friends to watch the series with me and they ended up hating Domestica because they noticed little things that I didn't notice that makes Chiaki an even bigger jerk then described. For this DVD though, beware the subtitles.",1362441600,3,8057,4.480599046970728

8503832,4,B006SW1PFI,"The overall quality of the anime was great but the subtitles were not. This DVD is not completely legit. If you know anything about subs and how they are usually done you would instantly notice. For people that like yaoi and shounen ai then you've probably heard of aarinfantasy. Well they translate and sub stuff from japan and are not ""professionals"" per se but they get the job done right and that's were the subs came from not the makers of the anime. Along with that the case of the discs was scratched and scuffed a little but still noticeable because its black. Other than that everything was fine. It came triple packaged. It also got here sooner than it was expected to be.",1342310400,6,682,4.508064516129032
