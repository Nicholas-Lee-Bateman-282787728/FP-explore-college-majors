2688249,3,B000KDZTIK,"Neither the total disaster the UK critics claimed nor the misunderstood masterpiece its few fanboys insist, Guy Ritchie's original UK cut of Revolver is at the very least an admirable attempt to add a little substance to his conman capers. But then, nothing is more despised than an ambitious film that bites off more than it can chew, especially one using the gangster/con-artist movie framework. As might be expected from Luc Besson's name on the credits as producer, there's a definite element of 'Cinema de look' about it: set in a kind of realistic fantasy world where America and Britain overlap, it looks great, has a couple of superbly edited and conceived action sequences and oozes style, all of which mark it up as a disposable entertainment. But Ritchie clearly wants to do more than simply rehash his own movies for a fast buck, and he's spent a lot of time thinking and reading about life, the universe and everything. If anything its problem is that he's trying to throw in too many influences (a bit of Machiavelli, a dash of Godard, a lot of the Principles of Chess), motifs and techniques, littering the screen with quotes: the film was originally intended to end with three minutes of epigrams over photos of corpses of mob victims, and at times it feels as if he never read a fortune cookie he didn't want to turn into a movie. Rather than a commercial for Kabbalism, it's really more a mixture of the overlapping principles of commerce, chess and confidence trickery that for the most part pulls off the difficult trick of making the theosophy accessible while hiding the film's central (somewhat metaphysical) con.

The last third is where most of the problems can be found as Jason Statham takes on the enemy (literally) within with lots of ambitious but not always entirely successful crosscutting within the frame to contrast people's exterior bravado with their inner fear and anger, but it's got a lot going for it all the same. Not worth starting a new religion over, but I'm surprised it didn't get a US distributor. Maybe they found Ray Liotta's intentionally fake tan just too damn scary?

Along with the original UK cut, the extras on the UK PAL DVD include a good interview with Ritchie and the editor, a standard love-in making of, music video and numerous deleted scenes. Unfortunately a cast and credits list is not included, which considering the absence of any credits on the film is a serious oversight. The US DVD only includes the re-edited US version.",1203120000,,2493,4.7953488372093025
2688250,5,B000KDZTIK,This movie blows me away. You have to be smart to get this movie. That's the problem with so many movies because they are designed for mass groups of stupid people. You really have to be able to think to figure this movie out. I love it. Great Soundtrack too. Remember if you don't like this movie it's because you are too stupid to get it. Ha ha ha you are dumb.,1201219200,,363,4.055555555555555
2688251,5,B000KDZTIK,"While it is easy enough to wash this over as too confusing or paradoxically ""dumb"" due to its presumed over-intelligence, it strikes me as a great springboard into thinking about bigger pictures. If you watch films for the guns, blood, racing cars and paper-thin plot, this is not the one for you (though there are some of these used).

Yes Guy has let slip some of Madonna's Kabalah into this movie, and yes it is far off tilt from what we of the spoon fed ""hook-cliche-clear cut ending"" crowd of TV and little else are accustomed to, but don't let that scare you away. Those frightening goblins called ""new ideas"" and ""challenges of world view"" are all around us, this movie included. While by no means an analytical philosophical work or any similar sort of academic endeavor, it does pay up handsomely in getting the gray matter churning.

Damn if I wouldn't like to see more of this from Guy or anyone else.",1200355200,,912,4.588957055214724
2688252,5,B000KDZTIK,"The new Guy Ritchie movie is a good movie not getting proper credit. Every one is saying he is repeating himself. So does Mr. Martin S.(Mean streets,goodfellas,casino).But each film has something new to offer and a new maturity to it. If you like Ritchie's other flix's then please watch this and vote to get it to American DVD soon. Great characters,good story and fun to watch...",1199491200,2,381,4.787878787878788
2688253,5,B000KDZTIK,"Despite the trend towards negativity in the other reviews this movie has received here, this film was in fact an excellent movie. No it was not a Lock Stock or Snatch type of movie, no it did not follow the mold of some of these movies Guy Ritchie has done in the past few years, but it was still an excellent work.

The acting is trashed because the characters being portrayed are not your usual characters, and so what is actually an extremely difficult role very well done is seen as poor acting. The film is confusing because it is meant to have depth, to make you think, and unlike Lock Stock and Snatch it has a theme. This movie has a MESSAGE. It is not a clear message because it is not an easy one to understand, and I'm not even sure if the makers of the movie meant it to come out this way, but there is a definite message in this movie that is clearer and more effectively communicated than about any other movie I've seen which touches similar topics.

In this movie you still get the gangster/mobster type professional killer characters, you still get the feel and plot type of a Snatch or Lock Stock movie, and the plot is as good or better than those movies, but in addition you have a depth and richness of meaning that was not present in those earlier works. While unconventional, and not easily understood to those looking for mindless action and excitement, this is a truly great movie and stands apart as one of a kind for all it attempts and, more importantly, PULLS OFF in a manner that, if you're open to it, will truly stun you. I won't even attempt to discuss the meaning of this movie in a mere review, I'll just say there is meaning in a way I wish more movies had the guts to attempt. See the movie, watch it multiple times, and I hope you will understand the message there. It is well worth the time.",1197590400,5,1830,4.301449275362319
2688254,1,B000KDZTIK,"This movie starts off well enough. We get some quotes about strategy and psychological tactics, we're introduced to some colorful characters, and we get what seems to be a plot about revenge through the use of the main character's con skills. One-third of the way later and we're looking at a con within a con. We know the character is being conned but we don't know how. Still, up to this point the movie is somewhat of a cliche but entertaining. The problem is the rest of the movie. The last one-third is so incoherent and incomprehensible that the best way to describe it is schizophrenic. And in fact you will start to think the characters in the movie have schizophrenia because in fact, through the use of those ever annoying voiceovers the characters will talk to themselves as if they had multiple personalities. They will argue with themselves in completely nonsensical ways about completely nonsensical matters. They won't even understand what they're babbling to themselves about, much less you the viewer. Apparently, this is supposed to reveal to the viewer something about the world/psyche of a con man. The only thing is revealed to me is that Guy Ritchie consistently makes poor movies.",1189814400,5,1203,4.901960784313726
2688255,4,B000KDZTIK,"If you're looking for another classic Guy Ritchie movie packed with laughs and crazy deaths than you're probably going to be dissapointed by this film.  It's a more mature move by Ritchie and goes in a completely different direction than any movie I've ever seen.  It was however, still a flop in the U.K. largely, I think, due to the confusion created at the end.  Also Ray Liota doesn't seem to really be acting until about 15 minutes into the movie.  Granted he performs marvelously after that, it just takes some getting used to and is a bit annoying when watching.  You should deffinitely watch this movie, but try to keep an open mind, and pay close attention.  I own it and love it, but I have to put it in my PS2 to watch it",1179792000,4,732,4.345588235294118

Or, take his money and seek out second opinions or alternative medicine, in locations far away from the hit man's reach. At least temporarily. Byes himself time to find out if the disease is real and make plans to return the favor to his enemies.

It's worth watching at least twice because it cuts to the heart of our western culture that's built on ego fulfillment.

Although this is styled as a gangster film, it is an excellent metaphor about modern corporations that are largely run by unintelligent egomaniacs who are amazingly overcompensated to runs their organizations through fear and intimidation.

These so called managers and executives accomplish nothing and ultimately cause problems and misfortune for themselves their customers, employees and shareholders.

This is all done while their moronic regulators and boards of directors sit around practicing nothing but wishful thinking.

Past the 30 minute mark it was very difficult to follow this film. It's dark and convoluted and its references to Kabalistic traditions and an overreliance on chess allusions only added to the movie's pretensions. According to Wikipedia there are two versions of this movie. The one that I saw was the ""concise"" version. That's a laugh. If what I saw was ""concise"" what would the convoluted version look like?

In general I like Ritchie's movies but this was one I simply could not follow. Perhaps in a few years when I see it again for a second time I will increase the rating. Until that time I give the movie a Three Star review.

I always want to sing the praises of this movie mainly for one reason-the amazing fact of life revealed in the end. To call this revelation mind bending is an understatement. I was astonished. But there is more to like than just this surprising ending. Spoiler alert-I may let on too much so don't read on...This movie just as a quirky gangster flick is fun and sometimes even funny. There are gunfights and surprising turns of plot and mystery.  Great music and a steady plot pace. There are interesting characters and you can find sympathy for people you wouldn't normally. The director knows how to make you like gangsters. And Statham's character is being manipulated by others but to what purpose? I liked the brief animation bits and the larger than life characters and the intelligence of the plot and insight into what a con is or could be. I was completely taken by surprise by the ending and how the entire movie led us to this conclusion! I won't reveal it....but trust me, there is a lot to like here.",1400371200,7,1116,4.575

2688402,2,B000KDZTIK,"With ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"" a new voice was heralded with Guy Ritchie being Britain's answer to Quentin Tarantino.  His followup ""Snatch"" did nothing to quell the optimism.  This film feels like a parody of those earlier efforts.  I give Ritchie points for trying to extend himself as a filmmaker but his ambition only goes so far.  The quick cut edits induce headaches, the multiple plot threads make you scratch your head, and the narrative is unnecessarily confusing.  Ritchie tries to cover his tracks by utilizing a variety of film styles and throws in a few notable quotations that only underline the pretentiousness of this whole endeavor.  When all is said and done who didn't see the end coming a mile away?  Of interest if you have a high tolerance for cinematic gobbledygook.",1390608000,,802,4.896296296296296
2688403,5,B000KDZTIK,"Cleverly plotted but not without flaws, I give it five stars because it rises far above the usual run of gangster/drug dealer/criminal thrillers and approaches the intensity of The Matrix and Pulp Fiction. Green, the hero, comes out of seven years in solitary and gets rich quick by applying a philosophy of criminality worked out by two master criminals in adjoining cells whose messages he intercepts. I won't give the rest away, but here's what's wrong with this movie: Chess masters don't suddenly sweep a piece across the board and say ""Checkmate!"" to their opponent's surprise. Most games at master level end long before checkmate, with one player resigning. Everyone fears the mysterious and immensely rich and powerful Sam Gold. But we never find out who he is. How does Green win games of chance in casinos? Even a good philosophy can't give you that edge. Why do cartoon scenes invade the middle of the movie, then disappear afterwards? How does Green's mysterious blood disease appear and disappear? In the climax, why does Green seem to be fighting himself at an earlier time, instead of the very real enemies who are controlling him now? Despite all these flaws, the movie somehow holds together. It's worth watching twice, which few films are.",1390003200,,1257,4.962085308056872

I do agree that the writing of the film is slightly wanting, but it overall it is really is good in my humble opinion.  The real reason for which I consider this to be one of my favorite films, is because of the spiritual ""Ego"" theme that is central to the film, and which seems to be largely overlooked by so many critics.  Admittedly, if I were not already very familiar with the Ego ideas inherent in the film, there is a very good chance that they would have bypassed me as well.

2688417,4,B000KDZTIK,"This is not your typical movie, it is not your typical Guy Ritchie film either. The movie is really an existential study about the Ego and The Id. I don't personally know anything about that stuff, but I loved the mix of con's and chess, the way Ritchie, and the actors commit is what makes the movie move. The more you get into it the more you get confused by what is real(if anything) and what is perception. If this sounds boring and stupid to you, please don't watch this movie! There are far more questions raised than are answered, which is somewhat symbolic of life I think, which I feel is the movies point. So again not for everyone, but if you dabble in philosophy or just like Grand movie experiments, give this flick a try.

2688419,1,B000KDZTIK,"""A witty saying proves nothing"" says Voltaire. And Guy Ritchie proves this point, with this pile-of-fail of a movie, which starts with a series of ""clever"" quotes from famous folks, building viewers' intrigue level and expectation; e.g., ""greatest enemy will hide in the last place you would ever look""  Caesar.

The plot is a hodge-podge mess, a great inspiration for film students to write theses on why and where Guy Ritchie, so completely missed the mark. I, I'm not a film student, but I'll describe the one key element of the plot, the one single factor, why the protagonist ""goes along"" with the plot of this movie, and you'll see how absurd it is, and by interpolation, you can adjust, and keep in check, any expectations you may have of this movie.

Warning: Spoiler coming up. If you have not seen this movie, and intend to buy/rent/watch this movie, DO continue to read, as it may help save two hours of your life.

The protagonist, Mr. Green, soon becomes the target of the ""bad guys"" trying to kill him. A set of characters (the ""Con. Men"") are introduced, who demonstrate ability to save his skin. At the same time, Mr. Green suffers a ""blackout"", which gets him to the hospital for tests. The Con. Men, somehow alter the medical results of Mr. Green's tests, indicating he only has three days to live. Knowing Mr. Green's fate -- the combined danger from the ""bad guys"" and his (fake) medical prognosis -- they make the proposal to protect Mr. Green from the ""bad guys,"" in return for all his money.

2688421,4,B000KDZTIK,"English director Guy Ritchie is known best for ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Snatch"" amongst longtime fans and the ""Sherlock Holmes"" films were able to help Ritchie stay afloat in the mainstream. While ""RocknRolla"" was considered a return to form for a guy who kept the crime thriller genre extremely close to his heart, his 2005 film ""Revolver"" is easily his most unique project to date. ""Revolver"" is known for having a mixed reputation; a 6.3 on IMDb, a 25/100 on Metacritic, and a dismal 16% rating on RottenTomatoes with the label of ""incoherent"" carved into it and cursed as such. But if you're able to accept a film that purposely doesn't connect all the dots while leaving much to the viewer's interpretation and are able to trudge through and persevere over a truckload of patience and letting your mind wander, then ""Revolver"" is just smart enough to be considered extraordinary.

Jake Green (a long-haired and handlebar mustache clad Jason Statham) has just finished a seven-year jail sentence and is now free. The man who put him there, Dorothy Macha (a mostly naked Ray Liotta) has kept busy and is about to become the next big casino boss of the city. After a bold confrontation between the two, Jake walks away with a large chunk of Macha's money but not before blacking out and falling down a flight of stairs. Jake is shot at once he returns home and a few of his friends die in the crossfire. Two men named Avi (Andre Benjamin) and Zach (Vincent Pastore) save Jake and inform him that he suffers from a rare blood disease that'll kill him within three days. If Jake wants to survive, he has to work with Avi and Zach, do whatever they say, and give away every penny he's ever earned without question. Feeling his life slip away with every dollar he gives away with the bitter taste of revenge still caked on his lips, Jake struggles with the thought that he's being conned but pursuing his gut instinct may cost him his life.

There are two very different versions of this film. The US version currently available on DVD and Blu-ray is a completely different cut compared to the UK version. Scenes are completely rearranged and edited in entirely opposing ways, but the biggest difference is the ending. The finale is essentially what makes the film and the ending to the UK version is far superior. The US version has actual professors dissecting the human ego playing over the credits that's really interesting and helps put the film in a semi-satisfying perspective, but the ending to the UK version is more exclusive. The film just ends with no credits as this drifting piano tune plays to a black screen during its final moments while the final confrontation between Jake and Macha is completely cut from the US version of the film.

""Revolver"" is a story about how much someone's life can be controlled by their ego. Is your ego really who you are or is it just who you think you are? It's been there for so long that it's difficult to distinguish the difference. That ego is obviously very self-absorbed, so greed becomes a factor in a very short amount of time. The Jake Green and Dorothy Macha characters are very similar, if not exactly the same. The difference is one of them gives into their ego while the other triumphs over it. The message the film portrays may vary depending on who you ask, but think of it like this; ""Revolver"" is a journey that isn't about getting rid of your ego. It's about learning how to control it. The Zach and Avi characters are a bit more complicated. Do they illustrate generosity? Are they just an extension of Jake's strengths; chess and cons? The US cut of the film removes a few important Avi lines near the end of the film. One of them being, ""We didn't do this because we like you. We did this because...we are you."" The ""Fight Club"" theory does seem to be the most logical, especially since Zach and Avi know everything about Jake and being in solitary confinement for seven years probably wasn't the best thing for Jake's brain.

The film is visually appealing like most of Richie's films. The colors are very rich and absorbing with extreme use of blue, red, and green. The green screen effects seem a little over polished at times as you can tell that no one is ever actually driving on actual roads and the glow of city life, whether it's during the day or night, is overly flashy. It's almost like it's purposely too bright to make it appear dream-like. Actual scenery is very intricate and detailed, especially during Macha's meeting with Lily Walker (Francesca Annis). There's also this intense car accident with Jason Statham that happens in an instant, but then plays backwards and in slow-motion. And more memorable one-liners than you can try to remember in one viewing (""Shine on you crazy diamond because we're all just monkeys wrapped in suits begging for the approval of others.""). The film utilizes animation in a really weird way. It's like it's used to illustrate extreme anger for certain characters (Zach, Macha, and Lord John). Either way, it's only used in the middle of the film for a short period of time.

This is the only film that Jason Statham has hair, so it should deserve at least a little credit for that. All joking aside, it's Statham's best performance. His lack of emotion is explained a bit more thoroughly in the UK cut as prison and the loss of his sister-in-law have left Jake completely numb. It's the elevator sequence that makes Statham's performance stand out. Not only is he arguing with himself, but he shows this raw passion that he almost never has the chance to show in anything else that he does. Ray Liotta is incredible, as well. For the most part, Liotta portrays the foul-mouthed gangster you've come to expect from him. But at his core, Macha is a broken, pitiful man who has this undying desire to be feared and respected. Macha breaks down in a few key scenes in the film and Liotta just knocks it out of the park with this fantastic sense of emotional range.

Mark Strong is perhaps the most badass he's ever been in any role as Sorter. Sorter is an assassin, who has a reputation for never missing, but his feelings suddenly get in the way and he starts missing when Macha puts a hit out on Jake. Sorter is a quiet man who stutters and is always adjusting his glasses, but he's featured in more than one superb action sequence in the film.

Hunting down the UK cut of the film and seeing both versions before passing final judgement on the film is practically required. Other things that were cut from the US release include Jake's history with Macha and the three Eddies (you see Paul (Terence Maynard) torture them but you have no idea who they are). The elevator sequence is also closer to the 1:15:00 mark rather than at the end of the film. Certain lines are cut that bring entire scenes together. The poker table scene at the beginning of the film is slightly longer. The different versions of the film are almost like different experiences entirely.

""Revolver"" is not a perfect film by any stretch of the imagination, but it also deserves a bit more credit than it's received. People are always complaining that Hollywood never takes any risks and that there's no originality breaking through. Guy Ritchie gave us something different years ago and everyone hated it; didn't even give him any credit for trying. ""Revolver"" is ambitious as hell and has a concept that is rather genius. Its flaws lie within how that's presented and executed. It's like the film can't decide whether to lay everything out in front of the viewer or to pull the rug out from underneath them and let them fend for themselves. What it does allow you to do is piece more and more together with every viewing.

There are at least two noteworthy performances here that everyone has just shrugged off over time with a beautiful score that is absolute perfection. ""Revolver"" taps into a struggle everyone faces that only a small few have been able to relate to. It's not that this film isn't a mess, but that mountain of a mess is on top of a shiny gem of a film that is worthy of being admired.",1369872000,3,8115,4.622052704576976

2688423,4,B000KDZTIK,"I understand those who lose patience with the abstract nature of Guy Ritchie's 'Revolver'-- which is miles departed from his bread-and-butter beginnings, the ultra-hip Brit-gangster revivals 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' and 'Snatch'-- and wish to wash their hands of his third crime feature entirely. But if you're thrown by its central conceit and have even the vaguest desire to understand what it's about, do yourself a favor and listen to the director's commentary track. I admit I really enjoyed this bizarre little headgame of a film without any analysis, and I was wary of sitting through Ritchie's explanation of his own work, fearing that a) he would come across as a pretentious twit, or b) he would ruin my enjoyment of the thing by revealing exactly how badly his creative intentions missed the intellectual mark. To my great relief, though, his insights are funny, self-effacing and, the biggest surprise of all, enlightening. Turns out he really did his homework putting 'Revolver' together and, while it certainly isn't the holy grail of cinematic achievement, its visual style, narrative and psychological themes do indeed marry neatly, which is why the movie bears repeat viewing. So whether you're into decoding metaphors and anagrams, exploring the many invisible facets of the ego, or just appreciate a slick action flick with oddball characters and rich imagery, click on the commentary and give 'Revolver' a second spin (your conceptualized self will love it, anyway).

2688427,4,B000KDZTIK,"Guy Ritchie is easily one of my favorite directors.  After being introduced to ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Snatch"" in high school by my best friend my cinema sphere increased ever so slightly and (save for ""Swept Away"") I have since gone onto to watch all of Guy Ritchie's films.  The very first time I watched ""Revolver"" I didn't get it, and thus I didn't like it.  (Higher thought at its finest, eh?)

However, the other evening my girlfriend and I sat down and watched it.  It was her first viewing and my second, but with a fresh perspective and several years this viewing was revelatory.  I would also like to mention that I had also just finished the game ""Bioshock Infinite,"" which touches on topics of a similar nature.  Except, in ""Bioshock"" the protagonist, Booker DeWitt, faces his own ego in the literal sense-an alternate version of himself, divulged from a single event.  I find this important, because with my mind still reeling from the plot of ""Bioshock Infinite,"" perhaps my mind was more open to a film concerning the confrontation of one's ego.

The top layer plot of ""Revolver"" is fairly straightforward, especially when considering Ritchie's past films.  It follows Jake Green (Jason Statham) after a seven-year stint in solitary.  During his time in solitary he `meets' the prisoners in the cells on either side of his due to the interception of secretly passed notes via daily book drops.  One of the aforementioned prisoners is a chess master, the other a master con artist.

With the promise of the three of them escaping together, Green shares quite a bit of personal information with the other two cellmates.  Eventually, the chess master and the master con artist escape without Jake, leaving him in solitary for another two-years.  Upon Jake's release he discovers that all of his money and worthy-belongings have been taken by the two other prisoners and any hint of them is two-years old.

However, he was imparted one gift from them-a working game theory.  Essentially, it is a list of rules that govern the literal and figurative `game.'  They can be applied to win chess, poker, or any game of chance, but given the right person they could be used to control events, scenarios, and the outcomes of life.

Some backstory: Jake Green was put away because of Dorothy Macha (Ray Liotta), and after learning the `rules' from the chess master and master con artist, he builds up his own personal wealth again after being released from prison.  After enough time and money has been built, Green decides to enact his revenge against Macha by humiliating him and conning him out of some money.

Green is successful, but this singularity sets off a chain of events that inevitably pits Macha against Green, involves the unseen Mr. Gold, and includes the mysterious chess player and con artist from Green's past in a film that not only tells of rival gangsters and loan sharks, but one that pits men against themselves in a battle of wits and ego.

""Revolver"" is stunningly shot.  There are some truly superb moment of cinematography that play into Ritchie's British, gangster-flick wheelhouse perfectly.  However, ""Revolver"" isn't your typical gangster film.  The plot isn't as twisty or grandiose as Ritchie's past endeavors, but it instead focuses on the more surreal.  The heart of the plot is in Green's confrontation of his ego and Macha's embrace of his.  What are the consequences of this, and how can we separate ourselves from our own worst enemy-our ego?

It's an immense topic to tackle, but Ritchie pulls it off with some clever writing and some amazing cinematography.  If you want something a little trippy and surreal with a crime flavor check out Guy Ritchie's ""Revolver.""",1365811200,,3728,4.882352941176471

Good luck making any kind of sense out of ""Revolver,"" a crime drama so complicated and convoluted that you'll need a program and a road map just to wend your way through it.  It's about two ruthless loan sharks (Vincent Pastore, Andre Benjamin) who manage to turn several underworld mob bosses against one another, using ex-con con man Jason Stratham as their bemused pawn.

There's a fair amount of dark humor to go along with all the bloodletting, but if you think the plotting is hard to piece together, it ain't nothing compared to all the voiceover philosophizing we're subjected to throughout the course of the movie.

Faced with a life-threatening, mysterious blood disease, Green is approached by two chess-playing loan sharks, Avi (Andr Benjamin) and Zach (Vincent Pastore). The two offer him a cure for his disease--in exchange for the use of his winnings from Macha's casino to fund their loan-sharking business.
Meanwhile, Macha is trying to wipe out Green and his two new friends before Green can make good on his revenge.

Lots of quotes from philosophers and chess masters pepper the cuts between scenes, almost as if Ritchie is reinforcing the ideas that the characters have expressed in their dialogue (or to drop hints as to what's going on). This can be a confusing movie, on the first viewing, but it's not a terrible movie. It's not going out of its way to be arty or pretentious; the story is told in Ritchie's usual round-about way. Only this time, it's not of a bunch of slang-speaking London thugs pulling a caper. The meaning's a bit deeper, here: rejecting the ego and its rules is one of the themes of the film. (""Revolver"" has been called Ritche's ""Kabbalah movie"", as he was heavily influenced by the symbolism of the teachings.) I liked it upon first watching it, but I soon watched it again, just to get a better idea of what was going on amid the twists and turns--this is not a very linear movie. A couple of viewings (and maybe an additional viewing with director commentary) help a lot.

Never the biggest Jason Statham fan (though I've seen him in other Ritchie films), I have to say, I enjoyed him here. He gives a quieter, more thoughtful performance than in, say, ""Snatch"". There is action, but those of you expecting ""The Transporter"" might be disappointed.
Ray Liotta, as Macha, redefines ""over-acting"": His crime boss is intense, brash and loud, but we also see the inner workings of a man used to getting his own way who's not sure if his luck will hold.
I enjoyed Pastore's Zach, but Benjamin as Ari was close to wooden. Maybe he's better elsewhere, but he wasn't very intimidating or interesting, here.
As Sorter, the nervous, stuttering hitman, Mark Strong is wonderful (but then, isn't he always?). Sorter is easily my favorite character: Cool under pressure, yet excitable and nebbishy, Sorter never misses, and if you see him pushing up the thick black frames of his glasses, you'd best get out of there. His best scenes are in a restaurant eliminating a drug lord's assassin, silently annihilating the drug lord's men at a strip club, and his ""U-turn"" near the end of the movie.

""Revolver"" is not the Guy Ritchie we're used to, but it is worth checking out. If you don't like it, you don't like it--doesn't mean you're not smart enough to get it (as some reviews allegedly imply), it just means that it's not your thing. But it is, in my opinion, well worth a look. Enjoy!",1317081600,,3383,4.759795570698467
2688452,4,B000KDZTIK,"Revolver, directed by Guy Ritchie and staring Jason Statham, Ray Liotta, and a few other notable figures such as Andre 3000 of Outkast and Vincent Pastore of the hit television series The Sopranos, is a gritty crime drama that follows Jake Green (Jason Statham) on his journey upon his release from prison. Green sets out to get back at casino owner and mob boss Mr. D (Ray Liotta) for putting him in prison by perfecting his gambling ability in order to rob Mr. D's casino of all of its money.

  The movie is in essence classic Guy Ritchie and features plenty of action and follows suit with some of his previous gangster style movies. But where this movie differs from most of his other work is in the underlying message that it presents. This underlying message is presented in the form of Jason Statham's tough gangster character, who throughout the entire film is struggling to free himself from something, which the viewer ultimately finds out in the movies final scene.

  The message, which has to do with freeing oneself from their ego is extremely interesting and thought provoking and actually made me reexamine certain aspects of how I live my life. And the perspective I take on many issues that present themselves to me daily.

  When Revolver is all said and done it does leave a lot to think about, but that's what is so intriguing about this movie. From its very subtle references to Kabbalah to its message that is the subject of studies done by psychologists, to its stereotypical gangster action that so many people enjoy. This movie is one that I recommend to all; just make sure to put your thinking cap on before you watch it.",1316563200,,1650,4.662068965517242

The viewer must work hard to stay engaged for at best a partial and mere intellectual reward of doubtful utility.  The filmmaker's message is delivered in such a muddled manner that the the visceral, experiential moment of understanding required for it to be valuable is withheld from the viewer.

I ""get it"" that this was Ritchie's philosophical film treatise on ""ego"". Too bad it was so ham-handed.  If this movie was 20 minutes shorter and more ""to the point"", it could have succeeded in showcasing the issues of ego and self.

If you go into this thinking your getting an action film or some kind of Guy Ritchie norm then you will most likely walk away confused and/or disappointed. The story is more of a psychological thought provoking...thriller I guess I'd say?

The main story is about Jake Green/Statham, his release from jail and his involvement with a couple of con artists that he works his way in with in a very interesting tale. The visuals are cool and dramatic in Guy ritchie fashion, there is some shooting and action but it's more so a talking type film. Ray Liotta in my opinion has a great performance and the whole cast was perfect for this film.

Supposedly Ritchie wrote most of the story having a ton of Kabbalah references built into it, me not being a follower of the Kabbalah still loved this film. I love trying to figure out why things were how they were and what was going on. You eventually can piece everything together and argue amongst friends for your own conclusions. I will say I have one gripe however, the UK release had a few different parts and a much different ending. Supposedly the US release was dumbed down because people were angry about the movie in the UK and they felt cutting the movie up would make it more accessible. I disagree. The original UK cut was amazing, this one is good but not as good due to the ending being changed primarily.

I would love to buy this on Blu-Ray and upgrade it from my DVD, but will not be doing so until a UK cut gets released here in the states.

Grade Rating: A+ (If you like psychological films with hidden meanings) Otherwise, don't bother...

*Updated 3/3/11* - I did break down and buy this on Blu Ray due to my love for this movie, sadly I was right and it is still the U.S. cut of the film. It looks and sounds gorgeous however if you are a fan of the film. Now just to get the UK cut released in the states ;)

*Updated 2/2/12* - After finding out the German version was region free and uncut I decided to re-order it on Ebay. As soon as it arrives and I watch it I will update this section. It's about double what the U.S. release is price wise, but in my opinion the edits on the U.S. version kind of mess up the film a bit.

*Updates 8/29/12* - The German Blu-Ray is amazing! However it has two downfalls, the scenes with Lord John (who only speaks Chinese through out the film) all come up with German subtitles. And the little scenes between the movie with the quotes are also in German. So that takes a bit away from the story, but is still a better version than the U.S. edition.

I was hoping that revolver is going to be another movie about the underdog beating the gang of brothers but half way through it I could not wait for it to end.  This is not ""Machinist"" or a ""Fight Club"" or any other number of the movies that we have already seen that address split personality or alter ego or some other kind of altered reality.  It is failed attempt to create high art.

There is a good deal of stylized action, but the script centers around some pretty profound spiritual and pyschological concepts. The essential theme will be quickly apparent to most students of religion, although the ending might prove a revelation to those with conventional ideas about the forces of good and evil. It's a well written film and Guy Ritchie does an okay job of bringing it to life, but only just. The major downfall of this film is Andre Benjamin. He's completely out of his depth in his role and his performance is painfully awkward and stilted. Ray Liotta tries to compensate by giving a somewhat over-the-top but nevertheless excellent performance. And Jason Statham is his usual brooding, menacing self.

2688470,5,B000KDZTIK,"Despite the trend towards negativity in the other some reviews this movie has received, this film was in fact an excellent movie. No it was not a Lock Stock or Snatch type of movie, no it did not follow the mold of some of these movies Guy Ritchie has done in the past few years, but it was still an excellent work.

The acting is trashed because the characters being portrayed are not your usual characters, and so what is actually an extremely difficult role very well done is seen as poor acting. The film is confusing because it is meant to have depth, to make you think, and unlike Lock Stock and Snatch it has a theme. This movie has a MESSAGE. It is not a clear message because it is not an easy one to understand, and I'm not even sure if the makers of the movie meant it to come out this way, but there is a definite message in this movie that is clearer and more effectively communicated than about any other movie I've seen which touches similar topics.

In this movie you still get the gangster/mobster type professional killer characters, you still get the feel and plot type of a Snatch or Lock Stock movie, and the plot is as good or better than those movies, but in addition you have a depth and richness of meaning that was not present in those earlier works. While unconventional, and not easily understood to those looking for mindless action and excitement, this is a truly great movie and stands apart as one of a kind for all it attempts and, more importantly, PULLS OFF in a manner that, if you're open to it, will truly stun you. I won't even attempt to discuss the meaning of this movie in a mere review, I'll just say there is meaning in a way I wish more movies had the guts to attempt.

I agree with most reviews in that the movie was edited in an incoherent way. The commentary said that it's Guy Ritchie's style. In this case I believe his style got in the way of his art. A good movie is a story that brings the watcher into that world. The only way I can explain it is that about half way in the movie the time sequences got mixed up and the story became hard to follow. Instead of experiencing the fantasy of the story, I had to step out of the movie. In my opinion it is not a good way to keep an audience.  The last quarter goes back to the original style of the movie but the viewer is left expecting more screwed up editing. I imagine that this may be why people are confused when they get to the elevator scene.

The elevator scene is the best scene in the movie. It's when Jake realizes that he is being conned by his own ego. For me, this is the zenith of the movie. If your confused when you watch it, just remember that when Jake's hair is nice then that's the real Jake, when his hair is messed up then that's his ego. We live in a world where we think we are our ego because our ego pretends to be us. You have to pay attention to perceive the differences.

It would have been nice to see more of Dorothy and his thought (ego) process as it compares to Jake's. Also Mr. Gold could have been more clearly defined as a king ego, or an ego based imaginary person created by Walker (who could have been another master con man).  The thing I would have like to seen most is a greater expound of the con man rules. To verbalize the con mans subconscious tactics. This was the greatest asset of the movie and I have yet to find a movie or book that does it so well.

In would normally give this movie 1 star. The poor quality of editing makes me question if it would even get that. The only reason I give this movie 5 stars is because it is the only movie I have EVER seen that delves into the ego. Until now I didn't know how closely related the con man was to spiritual enlightenment. It really put a lot of pieces together for me. And because of this movie I'm starting to see how the ego affects every aspect of our life, IT'S EVERYWHERE!! However, this movie REALLY needs to be redone. If a reedited version of the movie (with out the torture) was released then I'm sure it would become a cult classic over night, it`s that good.

2688474,3,B000KDZTIK,"Glad to read the other reviews here saying how much better the Brit version was, because this cut was rather boring and disjointed.

I love Statham in general, you can always sense humor under the tough veneer, and he's solid as always here. But the script is a little too impenetrable and this was cut very oddly, it seemed. Ritchie had a good concept that gets lost in the melee; I sure get tired of a new shoot 'em up every ten minutes. Violence is all too often a crutch for weak scripts and direction, and it sure is here.

The humor and knowingness of Lock Stock is gone, replaced by general confusion. Pastore and Benjamin add little to the proceedings, but I thought Liotta was good, if not used to perfection as in Goodfellas and others.

I'll have to find the UK version and give it another go. Statham and Ritchie are a fine team and worth another shot, as it were. The making-of doc shows them playing chess all the time, rather a surprise but pretty cool to an former chess hound like me. They mention, btw, that all the chess games in the movie were from classic matches, but there's a couple of board set-ups that are definitely not, like the one where q is on r5 early in the game. I'm pretty sure Capablanca or Alekhine were never using that opening, unless they were 3 at the time.

But on the minus side, there's precious little of the humor that made previous Ritchie movies like ""Lock, Stock"" and ""Snatch"" so much fun. And WORST of all: Just when you think Revolver is finally going to come to some sort of satisfying resolution, the film completely jumps the shark in the last 15 minutes and becomes something trying to be far too clever and psychologically profound for its own good.

I do have to give Guy Ritchie credit for acknowledging, in an interview to be found in the DVD extras, some of the vitriolic reviews the movie got upon release. ""Revolver"" is not a bad film, the former Mr. Madonna has got a lot of talent, and upon repeated viewings and pondering this might ultimately be considered a pretty deep film wrapped in a violent, stylish package.

2688480,5,B000KDZTIK,"On the basis of ""RocknRolla"" and this film, Guy Ritchie is now my favorite director currently making films. The film got generally poor reviews, both on its 2005 UK release and 2007 American re-edited version (which is what I saw). However, I decided to give it a try anyway because I liked his other films. Glad I did, because this film reminded me of the excitement and challenge of films like Robert Altman's ""Images"" and ""3 Women"" (both produced in the 1970s). I take it as a compliment that a director is willing to treat his audience as up for a challenge. How many films from the last decade is that true of?

Watching the film is like wandering into a maze and realizing it's going to take some time to figure your way out of it. Ritchie's script plants a lot of clues, and on the DVD commentary he and his editor reveal what the intention of the film was, but that just scratches the surface. It's not hard to ""get"" the film if you're willing to give it some effort (I played it, then heard the commentary track, then played it again). The performances are excellent, the cinematography and scoring both strong. I'm not sure it's quite the work of genius some of its cult admirers claim for it. Some of the allusions Ritchie builds into the film strike me as private conceits, like an Easter egg hunt to see how many the viewer can find. Regardless of their significance, they're fun. For instance, why is the film's heavy (played by Ray Liotta) named ""Dorothy""? A macho tough guy with a woman's name. Well, I have a suggestion. All the way through the third viewing I was thinking of ""The Wizard of Oz,"" because Jake Green is in the position of Dorothy in that film, trapped in a bizarre world attempting to fight a way out of it, only to discover the power to do so lay within him all along. Of course, Dorothy and Jake in this film are alter egos. But who knows whether that is what Ritchie intended?

Sadly, I found the film disappointing although it's not bad and definitely entertains. It does have some great elements--interesting plot features, Jason Stratham (a strength in any context), riveting characters, and a lot of action--however, like Gallipoli it was a fine idea that just doesn't work. As far as the acting goes I sort of felt like Ray Liotta mailed his performance in. He simply wasn't believable in the role of Macha. Also, there are several open-ends within the plot itself.

2688499,4,B000KDZTIK,"Don't you love movies that you're ready to watch again immediately after you've just finished it? I do, and Revolver is one of those films.

Guy Ritchie brings back his favorite star Jason Statham for his latest flick, which is in no way comparable to ""Snatch"" or ""LS&TSB"". Meaning not that it's a bad movie, but that Ritchie has the balls to not recycle his own material to resurrect his career. And thankfully so! Revolver plays a dream from a drug induced coma that you don't want to end, but when it does, you really, really wish you knew what just happened. Hence the high re-play value.

Did I mention the supporting cast? Well, it's certainly worth mentioning. Ray Liotta is powerful and convincing, a great casting decision considering that IMHO no else could have pulled off some of those self deprecating scenes that he exceled in. And who would have thought that Andre 3000 can actually act? Throw in Big Pussie, and we've got ourselves quite an ensemble.

The film does take itself a bit too seriously sometimes, and tends to over-philosophize abstract concepts without directly addressing the specific, but not so much that it's distracting or value detracting.

Bottom Line: Great re-play value, good with drugs!",1225411200,,1226,4.8798076923076925
2688500,2,B000KDZTIK,"Quite frankly, I don't know what Guy Ritchie wanted to do in ""Revolver."" Its tagline, according to IMDb, goes: ""Your mind will not accept a game this big."" OK, but what kind of game does this film really want to play?

Anyway, Jason Statham plays our anti-hero, skilled gambler Jake Green. After doing seven years in jail, Jake goes to a casino owner Macha (Ray Liotta) and humiliates him in front of his men, but on his way back he is attacked by the assassins sent by Macha. Luckily Jake is saved by Zach (Vincent Pastore) and Avi (Andr Benjamin), but these mysterious guys demand something extraordinary: Jake's money, all of it.

I could follow the terribly complicated story so far, but after 30 minuets I started to think: Who cares?

For the story goes on and on, but never makes a point. I don't see in what way repeated quotations (from Machiavelli, Caesar, ""Etiquette of Bankers"" and ""Fundamentals of Chess"") have to do with the convoluted story that doesn't know where to go. Jakes' frequent voiceovers are just annoying, and so is his long philosophical musing on the nature of his true enemy.

The only good thing about ""Revolver"" is Mark Strong, who plays a nervous bespectacled hitman. His scenes brighten up the muddled narrative with his superb acting and one shoot-out sequence involving his character shows Guy Ritchie has not lost his touch entirely.",1221955200,4,1370,4.7923728813559325

You'll want to watch this movie through once, and then look at it from a philosophical angle, putting the violence aside for a moment. On the surface this is a gangster style 'shoot 'em up' action, but savvy audiences will see there is a deeper, intellectual story going on. I do love these kinds of surprises, and it's a welcome bend in the road from your usual straight action movie genre. Jake, a tough ex-con finds himself in a casino game full of mind twists...but exactly who is doing the twisting? Jake is focused on getting even with the crime boss (played by the talented Ray Liotta) who killed his sister-in-law when two mysterious characters appear in his life. He's soon involved in a mind game that will leave him forever changed mentally. Like an intense Chess game, each move made by the two mysterious men seems to be very calculated and not without an end purpose. Chess players will really appreciate this one.

2688504,4,B000KDZTIK,"This is a thinking man's action picture. If you simply want to be entertained, it's not for you. Huge difference between a film not being ""for you"" and it being a bad film though.

In essence, it's an exploration of ego. Deeper explanations would ruin the movie for you. There's plenty of shooting and interesting crime world characters. I think what makes people uncomfortable with the movie is two things. 1- They're caught up in their ego and don't want to admit it. 2- It's just not a straightforward formulaic Hollywood flik. It's just not.  3- They don't ""get"" it.

I hate it when I don't get a movie and don't know where to turn at the end too, but the director deals with this. When you're done watching the  film, stay for the credits and listen carefully, it's spelled out for you. Repeated viewings and director commentary reveal the film on additional levels.

Some say it's a pretentious film, but that isn't true either, not by definition of the word. It doesn't come across as trying to appear more important than it is. In fact, the struggle of the ego, whether internal or external, is THE most important battle any of us faces. Ego maturity is directly related to whether and how we evolve, learn or grow. Honestly, what in your life is more important to you than you?

Jason Statham dug a little deeper than usual for this performance. Andre 3000 was a little bland in line delivery, but in overall portrayal, awesome. Lots of good lines in here too. But take note that the books it claims to quote from or reference don't all exist.

See this when you're feeling introspective, or when you're ready to take your exploration of self to the next level. It's got high replay value as well, every time I see it I learn something new about myself and notice things I didn't see before.",1216512000,5,1800,4.554179566563468

But this is where Ritchie throws a bit of a curve, having a bit less action and a bit more contemplation.  [spoiler alert] The film takes the viewer on a journey and winds up showing Statham's Jake Green as schizophrenic, breaking off into two people, an ego-based alter-ego and the outer physical man.  It seems a bit at odds with the very logical performance we see from Statham, but that's my interpretation.  Ray Liotta who won an Emmy for his 2005 guest appearance on TV's ""ER,"" plays Macha, the bad guy crime boss who runs around either in his underwear or with nothing at all in several parts of the film.  Liotta's performance is actually very good, but not particularly connected to the other people in the film.

Benjamin has previously been in the films&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Four-Brothers-Special-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000BDH6BC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Four Brothers (Special Collector's Edition)</a>&nbsp;&<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hollywood-Homicide/dp/B0000B00KB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hollywood Homicide</a>.  His sidekick is Zach played by TV's ""Sopranos"" star Vincent Pastore.  Much of the film is a puzzle that the viewer tries to unravel.

So I'm thinking there's some magic in their collaboration.  Magic that's clearly missing from Revolver.

A few good action sequences, good dialogue, and spotty but great moments in performance from the cast mix into a fair film.

2688510,2,B000KDZTIK,"I've seen four feature films written/directed by Guy Ritchie, two of which I like very much. His first full-length feature ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" shows a lot of energy, creativity, and wit in style which he may not have created but to which he certainly contributed a lot. Immediately, Ritchie was compared to Quentin Tarantino but with all the similarities, Ritchie's debut was a refreshing, lean, original, and very enjoyable on its own merits British mixture of Action Comedies/Gambling Dramas/Crime Thrillers. ""Lock, Stock.."" also introduced Jason Statham with whom Ritchie went on to making two more films and Vinnie Jones, a football player turned an actor. This one was certainly a Hit. Ritchie's next, Snatch, his first movie I saw, is simply marvelous and my favorite. It uses the same broken narrative as Lock and Stock, intertwines numerous plot threads which intersect and play off each other, and follows the characters who are over-the-top deliciously evil, marvelously clueless and always funny. A Big Hit! Then there was ""Swept Away"" which I better skip. Remakes are rarely a good idea, and that particular remake was certainly a bad one. A miss.

Now we are coming to ""Revolver"" (2005) that was described as Ritchie's return to the genres he had proved to be the most successful with, Crime / Drama / Thriller but with the psychological and even philosophical twist. Sounded great and I was very exited. The fact that two of the respected film critics rated ""Revolver"" one star and half star, only added to my interest. ""The Revolver"" revolves around Jake Green (Jason Statham with long hair and a beard), a gangster, a gambler, a chess-player, a con-master who had spent seven years in the Solitary Confinement thanks to the crime boss, the Casino owner, Dorothy Macha (Ray Liotta) and is out for revenge. It is definitely better than half star or one star. Visually, it is the most polished Ritchie's work, the acting was good, and I really liked it up until 1 hour 27 minutes mark. The final scenes were laughably bad, annoying, devoid of any humor, and tried too hard to finish the movie on some complex metaphysical note regarding the game, the winners, and the losers. The trick Ritchie tried to pull on me was hitting me over the head again and again with the pieces of wisdom such as ""The greatest enemy will hide in the last place you would ever look"", ""in every game and con there's always an opponent, and there's always a victim. The trick is to know when you're the latter, so you can become the former"", and the deepest of them all, ""The greatest con, that he ever pulled... was making you believe... that he is you."" Thanks for trying to enlighten me but I found these quotes rather banal, superficial, and worst of all absolutely not funny. Revolver is a typical example of how a potentially enjoyable movie was ruined by its creator's ambitions to make an ultimate complex metaphysical-psychological magnum opus.",1212019200,5,2961,4.863366336633663
2688511,5,B000KDZTIK,"This movie is a completely different beast than 'Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels', and 'Snatch'. I enjoyed both of those movies immensely. But Revolver is quite unique to any movie I have seen.

I actually saw this movie a few years ago. It was released in the UK and Europe in 2005 in theatres and DVD. I purchased a copy online. I wondered at the time why it hadn't been released in the U.S.

Firstly, I cannot say much about the story, because I don't want to give anything away. It's that type of movie. Reminded me of the first time I saw 'Fight Club'. I said, ""what the f---?"" But I knew I'd just witnessed something pretty awesome. Definitely a movie you have to see twice.

I would really emphasize that to anyone interested in this film. It REQUIRES multiple viewings. I figured the movie out midway through the second watch. But it took several viewings to fully understand. Also, seeing other reviewers on different sites when the movie originally came out, it was definitely those who watched it several times to understand it that fell in love with 'Revolver'.

A warning here for some of you: lots of violence and blood and profanity. If that's alright with you, the movie is a thrill to watch. It tries some different things that really worked for me. Excellent sound editing, with the gritty voice over by Jason Statham. The editing is frantic. I have to say, the Elevator Scene, you'll know what I am referring to after viewing, is one of the most intense movie scenes I've ever seen.

That scene, and the finale. The final scene. In a word, INTENSE. This movie really goes out with a bang. One of my favorite all-time endings. Ray Liotta, fantastic. Great to see him with a top notch performance. Statham carries the movie. Also, Sorter, the hitman, really has a classic performance.

'Revolver' is filled with memorable scenes. They went out on a limb trying new things and it really paid off. Notably, the animated sequence is pretty cool. Dialogue: Unbelievable. Some of the things Jake (Statham) says in the voiceover, it's just really great stuff. And I loved the way they worked the quotes into the movie.

I understand that it could be a frustrating and very confusing movie to many. Again, I would highly recommend multiple viewings. But this is no doubt a movie not to be liked by all. But some of you will love it as I did.

'Revolver' really demands your attention. It has a deep and cool message behind all of it. This movie is sure to be a cult classic. Give it 5-10 years and some people will see it for what it is. A masterpiece.

The final question you'll be asking... Who is Sam Gold?",1210032000,7,2621,4.536016949152542

It's still a great movie and in my opinion perhaps his best (original version), although I know people will shout and scream it's far from his best.

2688514,2,B000KDZTIK,"Guy Ritchie's previous British crime thrillers have their detractors, but they also have an amiable charm and cocky intelligence that are hard to resist.

This new one, however, is not like the others.

This is a movie that's so wound up, so pumped full of macho barium, that it eventually becomes an excruciating experience.

Ritchie stretches out this time -- both in terms of plot and ambition -- and loads the movie with more style than all his previous movies combined. Wild sets and characters? Yes. Grandiosity that approaches Greenaway? Yes. Operatic in sound and scale and peppered with an occasionally cool shoot-out? Sure.

But it's all shot through with a plot so intentionally convoluted, and Luc Besson production style so brassy and arranged, that watching ""Revolver"" quickly becomes like flipping through the ads in Vanity Fair with a 105-degree fever.  And not in a good way, either.

In his commentary, Ritchie admits he's playing with the idea of ego and the notion that enemies and competition are all simply a product of the individual's interior desires.  That's a great concept on which to base a crime thriller but the movie is overloaded with too-obvious twists, faux-""Fight Club"" camera tricks and a ridiculously overblown sense of drama. Some scenes that inexplicably involve animation don't help either -- they don't make sense within the story and only serve to draw more comparisons to Tarantino, who did all this first and better within ""Kill Bill.""

You know you're in trouble when you're watching a movie and you realize everybody in the film cares way, way more about the situations at hand than you do. In the case of ""Revolver,"" I'm pretty sure the main characters were 210% more concerned with the goings on of the story than I was.

Meanwhile, a tangerine-tan Ray Liotta -- as, ostensibly, ""the bad guy"" -- spends most of the movie threatening his underlings and colorfully demanding they kill his enemies. Andre 3000 is joltingly self-conscious as a mysterious loan shark. And lead Jason Statham wanders through it all knowing his character is being played by some kind of scam, but submitting anyway. We know this because he spends the bulk of a seemingly endless voiceover reiterating what's already painfully obvious to the viewer.

The most interesting part of the film is actually the end credits. That's when Ritchie rolls out interviews with experts and pundits talking about the concept of the ego. The fiction pushed me away, but the facts (or the search for facts) actually pulled me back.",1208304000,4,2538,4.9787234042553195

All this, however, is not as much Guy Richies fault as it is our own. We expect him to do so and so, and when he doesn't we get disappointed.

There are some great features in the film. It is well shot, well directed, and well acted. And the character of the assassin and just about everything he does is nigh on brilliant. The story is, however, in my opinion, a bit bland, a bit stock if you will. It is clever on a low level and not worthy of a big budget. And that is basically where it ends for me. The story is not interesting, the film is not interesting.

So apart from a couple of great scenes and takes on things, it is just ordinary and pretty run of the mill. See it on a sunday afternoon with nothing better to do. If for example you've broken your leg and have run out of books.",1207872000,5,989,4.222222222222222
2688518,1,B000KDZTIK,"I am a fan of Snatch and Lock/Stock, but Revolver is missing one key element of Ritchie's previous work--a sense of humor and playfulness. Revolver takes itself way too seriously for my tastes. While some may argue that the random shots of Ray Liotta in his banana hammock are evidence of humor, I'm not buying it.

Revolver is pretentious and disorganized in the worst kind of way.  There are poorly placed flashbacks that interrupt the flow of the narrative, an endless parade of stereotypical characters who are supposed to represent different character traits, and don't forget the annoying ""life is a game"" dictums that lamely attempt to reinforce the so-called themes of the movie.  The potentially interesting pieces of this film are mixed up beyond recognition, making it very frustrating to watch.

Don't be deceived by the reviewers who claim that ""if you didn't like it, you didn't get it.""  On the contrary, if you didn't get the movie, it's because Guy Ritchie was too busy showing off his knowledge of elementary psychology to fully develop his plot, characters, and themes.  THAT is a flaw in the film, NOT in the viewer.

It's an in-depth look into the mind of someone put into a very sticky situation. How they think, and how those thoughts become actions. If you understand the message, it's pretty easy to relate to. It comes off way more complicated than it really is.
Also, the acting is TERRIBLE. Except for Jason Statham, surprisingly. He's brilliant as the main character, and does a wonderful job with his inner monologue that plays throughout the film. Unfortunately, even though I'm a fan of Ray Liotta, this is the worst i've ever seen him.

The plot was well thought out, and most of the cast did a superb job.  This might be one of the best performances by Jason Statham.  I would give this move a good recommendation with reservations.

There are a couple of things that ruin this movie.  Ray Liotta seem out of his element in this role, he just doesn't come across as real as the other characters in the film.  In the middle of the film there were a couple of action sequences that cut to animation and this really distracted from the feel of the film.  When I got to the end, it unfolded just like I thought it would.  The big surprise at the end of the movie was really easy to figure out.

If you are a fan of Jason Statham or relly like dark films about gangsters, you will probably enjoy this film.  If you want something with a little more substance, skip revolver and check out Snatch.  It is another Guy Ritchie film and much better than Revolver.",1207353600,7,988,4.229946524064171
2688521,1,B000KDZTIK,"For some people, including most of the other reviewers, this might be a very thought provoking movie.  For this  reviewer, who is neither into mysticism nor into philosophy, this was pretentious, badly structured and boring. I kept on thinking there was going to be a big punchline and revelation, beyond what was gradually becoming apparent.  I thought it was aiming for a dramatic movie finale like 'Angel Heart', 'Fight Club' or 'Usual Suspects' but it ended with a underwhelming philosophical dud instead that left me scratching my head.

You know Usual Suspect's tagline - 'The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he did not exist'?  Well, it's said twice, makes a whole lotta sense and defines the whole movie.

The equivalent pearls of ""wisdom"" in Revolver?  And the obligatory flashbacks?  Repeated about 10 times each just so you couldn't possibly miss their portentous significance.  Despite good acting and visuals, as the movie progressed  I was not just bored, but actively annoyed by all the repetition and meandering plot.

Reading about it afterwards on Wikipedia, it seems whole scenes have been edited out, so maybe the original version was better.  The psych talking heads at the end did not make it any better either.  Bad sign, in fact - the ending doesn't stand on its own so it needs explaining.  Kinda like ""Don't you get it?  It's because..."" at the end of a joke.

This is a movie about madness, and revenge, and ego, and greed.  The voiceover is a little much, and Statham doesn't look all that great in this film.  The action is not up to par with his other movies and there is little to no humor at all.  Infact, I felt more like I was watching a David Lynch film with less definition.

2688524,4,B000KDZTIK,"When the name Guy Ritchie is attached to a film, the audience can depend on lots of action, violence, crisp dialog, and nail-biting sequences: his films have a 'look' and a manner that could easily be trademarked.  In REVOLVER, Ritchie keeps all of those elements, but also adds the bite of challenging the audience to keep abreast of what is actually happening in the mayhem that unfolds, and it is this new element of psychological twisting of characters that makes the film so successful.  It doesn't hurt that the cast contains some excellent performances by some of the very best actors of the action genre of films.

Jake Green (Jason Statham) is released from prison where he has served time in solitary confinement, by his own choice, enabling him to concentrate of the evils of graft and corruption and the deadly games people can play that call for revenge.  He is cocky, wily, and full of tricks as he becomes involved in a master con game with one Dorothy Macha (Ray Liotta), the man who was responsible for his imprisonment. Macha  is determined to take Jake down, but Jake falls into a 'partnership' with two bizarre characters - Avi (Andr Benjamin) and Zach (Vincent Pastore)- and begins to explore his own identity and apply those surprises to his compulsion to destroy the seemingly implacable Macha. How this redirection of evil and revenge unfolds is the chess game strategy of the film.  To relate more of the plot would destroy the pleasure of the audience participation the film demands.

Ritchie wrote the screenplay with Luc Besson and the result is a story that manages to confuse while it entertains. Clever devices of plot turns and bits of philosophy from the most surprising characters flash quickly, enhancing the expected rough and tumble action of Ritchie's previous successes. Jason Statham is thoroughly in his element here, but the surprise performance comes from Ray Liotta who, under Ritchie's direction, turns in probably his best work to date. This is a thinking person's action flick, well made, and well worth watching!  Grady Harp, March 08",1206230400,27,2082,4.928571428571429

I'm personally a large fan of Guy Ritchie's, and have seen ""Snatch"" and ""Lock, Stock..."" more times than I could hope to count. I bought this DVD with some apprehension, though, because I've heard relatively lukewarm (if not negative) reviews.

First of all, this movie is neither ""Snatch"" nor ""Lock, Stock..."" It's most definitely not a comedy. It's actually quite psychological, but not incomprehensibly so. I don't want to go into the entire story for you (you can read the product description for that), but I will admit for the most part the movie does remain a bit cryptic. However, upon multiple viewings, things tend to come together a lot more clearly. In fact, one could piece everything together just watching the special features if they were left somewhat in the dark the first time through. The closest movie I can think of to relate this to would most likely be ""Fight Club."" Surely there are better examples out there, but this is the one that stuck out most in my mind. Things can get a little trippy and confusing at times, but sticking it out is worth it. If you're on the fence, I'd maybe suggest renting it first. I understand that not everyone likes to rack their brains when they watch a movie, and there's nothing wrong with that.

2688529,5,B000KDZTIK,"Jake Green (Jason Statham) finds himself in prison for seven years. He spends this time in solitary confinement, but he has contact with the two mysterious characters also serving solitary in the cells on either side of him (ones a con man - ZACK Vincent Pastore, the other a chess master AVI Andre Benjamin). Avi and Zack write messages in books while in solitary that Jake intercepts, he never actually sees these individuals, he just receives their concepts. One is a formula for the ultimate con, but Jake cant understand the depth of it. Avi and Zack plan to break out of prison and agree to break Jake out as well. The next day they are gone, but they didn't take Jake with them. He feels cheated.

While Jake is still in prison Avi and Zack steal all the money Jake has hidden on the outside, they trusted Jake with the formula and he trusted them to let them know of his moneys whereabouts. They leave a message where his money once lay.

The first rule of any game. YOU CAN ONLY GET SMARTER BUY PLAYING A SMARTER OPPONENT.

Cut to two years later.

When Jake gets out of prison, broke and penniless, he starts to practice what he understands of the formula and of the con he learned from Avi and Zack. Its very successful and he does very well in world of gambling, he learnt a valuable lesson from the two conmen inside.

Once Jake is up on his feet again (financially speaking), he takes on his nemesis the power hungry Dorothy Macha (Ray Liotta). Jake beats him in a game of chance, humiliating Macha. Fearing more of the same, Macha wants revenge and orders a hit on Jake.

A mysterious man approaches Jake and informs him that he is in desperate physical trouble from an internal disease. He tells Jake he and his partner can save him from both Macha and his physical aliment.

Simultaneously, Macha is trying to get into business with the infamous, but apparently invisible Sam Gold. He makes a deal with his female representative Lily Walker (who represents the queen on the chess board). Macha is warned if he does not come through on the deal that Sam Gold will be very disappointed. Macha is after the reward of being in business with Gold (who represents the opponent) and foresees no problem.

The deal is for some white powder, which represents vice of multiple manifestations, in other words, false ways to get away from Gold or win the game, but perversely these just bring you closer to him.

Jake agrees to do whatever the two mysterious characters tell him to do (a gun to the head so to speak - he has three days to live), there is no time to haggle, and he is prepared to do whatever hes told by these characters. Avi and Zack appear to be loan sharks and gradually force Jake to give away all his money that he made using the con, much to his despair. This is so painful that it seems to be killing a part of him and it gets even worse for Jake. Avi and Zack force him to do whatever he hates to do. Jake suffers from claustrophobia and is forced into elevators, generally Jake goes on a physiological ride from hell. They also sabotage Machas deal with Gold, putting Macha in jeopardy with Gold. To make matters worse, they make it look like an opposing crime boss is responsible this sabotage, Lord Jon (Tom Wu). These two gangs destroy one another through their ignorance and greed.

Jake's journey climaxes when Avi and Zack, now his masters, ask Jake to shoot a man that didn't pay a debt. Jake refuses, going against the voice in his head. This is the turning point and just when Jake has had enough he forces the two mysterious characters to reveal their game. Is he ready for the answer? What is the point of putting him through all this pain?

Avi and Zack simply repeat the treasured formula that he learnt in prison and which we are told at the start of the film.

The first rule of any game. YOU CAN ONLY GET SMARTER BUY PLAYING A SMARTER OPPONENT.

Jake now realizes that he has fallen victim to this formula, that he is actually in the game, and the opponent or Sam Gold, is hiding in his own head, the last place he would ever look. How does this happen? Because Sam Gold hides behind Jakes pain, the last place he would ever look. We realize Sam Gold is a metaphor for the ego, Devil, the opponent.

Now armed with this information, which has been so elusive, Jake really goes to war with himself. He realizes the game Avi and Zack have made him play has been to diminish the Sam Gold within him and that is why he felt like he was dying, because a part of him was.

This game it seems is back to front. Jake gives away his remaining money to a charity in Dorothy Machas name and Macha takes the credit. At this point we understand that the voice we hear in the film as a voice over is not a voice over at all, its the Sam Gold in each of our characters heads. Macha is being fattened up by the voice in his head who encourages Macha to take the credit.

To conquer the game Jake now realizes he is in, he goes to Macha and humiliates himself, begging for forgiveness at the foot of his bed. This goes completely against the voice in Jakes head, which is now in major agony. Jake then takes an elevator that gets stuck, its his worst nightmare, but here is where a real battle takes place. Jake induces the pain Sam Gold hides behind. Sam Gold tries every technique to control Jake, but Jake is now detached enough from the voice to fall for it. Embrace the pain and you will win this game, Jake sheds himself from Sam Gold completely and the elevator starts up as soon as Jake has control. He realizes he was still in prison and that he had never left the prison of the mind, now he is free.

As the elevator doors open, there stands a confused and angry Macha with a gun in his hand. He cant understand what game Jake is playing, but Jake no longer cares about Macha, gun or no gun, he walks straight past him. Macha loses control, because Jake doesnt fear him, his ego cant handle this, he breaks down from the voice that has got complete control over him. He knows Sam Gold is going to come and get him, what he doesnt realize is that Sam Gold is already getting him from the inside.

Jake, now understanding that the mysterious characters Avi and Zack are not who he thought they were, finishes a game of chess in Machas casino with Avi. Here it is revealed that Avi could have beaten him at any time. Avi tells him one of the rules again, the art is for the opponent to feed pieces to the victim to make them believe they took those pieces because they are smarter and you are dumber. Jake realizes that these are his two friends from prison. They promised they would break him out of prison and they did, its just Jake didn't realize it was the prison of his mind and how big that prison was.

In the end its a story about realizing that the prison is the mind and the ego is the master of that environment. The only real enemy to have ever existed is an internal one and he controls the external world. This is the opponent you need to test you, as you get smarter so does he. The ego or Satan is your coach. Once its recognized for what it is, it can be mastered, but without recognition of this situation, you are simply an unconscious slave and the game hasn't revolved.",1205971200,15,7227,4.320295202952029
2688530,3,B000KDZTIK,"I had originally seen Revolver on it's opening night in local cinema in England.  That movie I saw there was a five star movie.  When it was released in the UK as a DVD, I pick up a copy at a nearby HMV.  It was the same awesome movie I saw in the theatre.  Now, I'm back in the USA and I hear a region 1 version is finally available.  I purchased it out of convenience.  I thought a couple scenes seemed short, but when the movie ended where it did, I started checking the deleted scenes.  No Joy!  Watching this version, you are left with a much different message and no sense of closure.

I don't think this edit terribly ruined the movie, but I seriously question the motive behind it.  I would be shocked if it was Mr. Richie's decision.

Now, for those fans of ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Snatch,""  you may not like this movie.  It depends on what your tastes are.  Fans of David Lynch's ""Lost Highway"" or ""Inland Empire"" might warm to this film a little better.  I would say the movie falls somewhere between the two camps.

Guy Richie spells out quite a bit for you, but he leaves a lot open to interpetation and analysis.  I applaud the fact the director doesn't spoon feed it to you.

On a purely visceral level, he wows the audience with an arsenal visual effects.  Fortunately, this not distract from the story.

However, I cannot emphasize how much better the original UK version is.  I hope that somewhere down the road a more complete package of the movie is released.

2688532,5,B000KDZTIK,"This movie is not a typical action flick. It causes you to think, even when it gets to the point where it starts holding your hand. Many people will not like this movie. Perhaps they won't understand it and some because it won't be what they expect. I won't explain it, that would ruin it for others. Just know this is not a simple movie, if your paying attention it will get you to ponder the why.

The whole cast is fantastic, Jason Statham is brilliant.",1205798400,5,456,4.3023255813953485
2688533,5,B000KDZTIK,"This movie is a completely different beast than 'Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels', and 'Snatch'. I enjoyed both of those movies immensely. But Revolver is quite unique to any movie I have seen.

I actually saw this movie a few years ago. It was released in the UK and Europe in 2005 in theatres and DVD. I purchased a copy online. I wondered at the time why it hadn't been released in the U.S.

Firstly, I cannot say much about the story, because I don't want to give anything away. It's that type of movie. Reminded me of the first time I saw 'Fight Club'. I said, ""what the f---?"" But I knew I'd just witnessed something pretty awesome. Definitely a movie you have to see twice.

I would really emphasize that to anyone interested in this film. It REQUIRES multiple viewings. I figured the movie out midway through the second watch. But it took several viewings to fully understand. Also, seeing other reviewers on different sites when the movie originally came out, it was definitely those who watched it several times to understand it that fell in love with 'Revolver'.

A warning here for some of you: lots of violence and blood and profanity. If that's alright with you, the movie is a thrill to watch. It tries some different things that really worked for me. Excellent sound editing, with the gritty voice over by Jason Statham. The editing is frantic. I have to say, the Elevator Scene, you'll know what I am referring to after viewing, is one of the most intense movie scenes I've ever seen.

That scene, and the finale. The final scene. In a word, INTENSE. This movie really goes out with a bang. One of my favorite all-time endings. Ray Liotta, fantastic. Great to see him with a top notch performance. Statham carries the movie. Also, Sorter, the hitman, really has a classic performance.

'Revolver' is filled with memorable scenes. They went out on a limb trying new things and it really paid off. Notably, the animated sequence is pretty cool. Dialogue: Unbelievable. Some of the things Jake (Statham) says in the voiceover, it's just really great stuff. And I loved the way they worked the quotes into the movie.

I understand that it could be a frustrating and very confusing movie to many. Again, I would highly recommend multiple viewings. But this is no doubt a movie not to be liked by all. But some of you will love it as I did.

'Revolver' really demands your attention. It has a deep and cool message behind all of it. This movie is sure to be a cult classic. Give it 5-10 years and some people will see it for what it is. A masterpiece.

The final question you'll be asking... Who is Sam Gold?

UPDATE March 21st, 2008: This review is actually for the UK version. I rented the US version tonight, because it is a great movie and I haven't seen it in a while. Turns out, the movie has been changed quite drastically the US release.

The original ending, which is one of my all-time favorite endings (as noted in the review) is gone! The elevator scene, which happens near the 3/4's mark in the original version, is part of the ending here. A few other parts were completely cut out.

I feel like they botched it. Reminds me of 'Once Upon a Time in America', where they released the ridiculously edited and cut version and it bombed. But the full length version of that film is a masterpiece.

My STRONG ADVICE: Forget about this one. Get an all-region dvd player and buy the Region 2 version on eBay for $20.",1204588800,48,3435,4.51207729468599
2688534,1,B000KDZTIK,"Unlike the previous 5 star reviewer, I (unfortunately) HAVE seen this movie and it is simply awful. I am a huge fan of ""Lock, Stock"" and ""Snatch"", and even thought Guy Ritchie's remake of ""Swept Away"" was watchable. So going into to this one I had high hopes. Well, the production design is lovely and the camera work features Ritchie's signature jazzy, vivid style. But the storyline? Seriously, if anyone can figure out what this movie is supposed to be about, the progression of the plot and characters, or the moral of the story they deserve a medal. I think is it something to do with gangsters and somehow ties in with the Kaballah religion that Ritchie follows, but beyond that I haven't got a clue. All I got from ""Revolver"" was a migraine headache.",1204502400,16,757,4.614814814814815

8155731,4,B000KDZTIK,"The movie in it's original un-reformatted (netflix) state is a GREAT movie. Edgy, stimulating, enlightening and much easier to follow. This version goes well until it is 3/4th done. Then you can't tell what the heck is going on. Scenes were resequenced or taken out to confuse and confound. Our satanic run media wouldn't allow it to be aired on TV (Showtime) without these amendments for they feared the masses would become enlightened and rebel against their programming.
The acting, and I loathe actors, is riveting and top notch. The story line is amazing. The tension displayed is the best since Payback.
The movies is about the devil. Who he is, what and how he controls and where he hides. It has quotes form Julius Caesar, Art of War and Machiavelli that explain the action behind the action we are watching.  Religion is nobilized and spiritually constituted as a virtue. But this theme strikes at the very perverted atheist heart  of Hollywood and of their power over the masses so it was recut and reformatted to mean nothing at the end. To even distance the movie from its intended theme further this gut has a bunch of 'psychotherapists/philosophers, etc' thrown in at the end to dismiss that there is even a devil thus affirming what the movie was actually about.",1518998400,,1277,4.8

8155733,1,B000KDZTIK,"I watched the whole movie, and after the end, did not understand the story, ending, plot, or meaning, at all.  Directors these days think they can paste together a bunch of film shots and call it a movie.  This movie has no story, no plot, no ending, and makes no sense.  This director is over rated and this movie is one of the worst ever made.  It makes no sense, is pretentios beyond belief, and should never have been made.  Movies like this should end a director's career.  Sorry, you are not allowed to movies anymore. After wasting countless hours of peoples time with this trash, you lose the right to make films.

8155736,5,B000KDZTIK,Saw this when it came out and kinda liked it. Saw it again recently as a more mature adult and realized it's genius. It's deeper than just a typical fun Guy Ritchie type flick like Snatch (which I also love and own). It's more psychological and interesting probably to those who are interested in psychology or those who participate in meditation and such.  LOVE IT.,1515715200,,366,4.630769230769231
