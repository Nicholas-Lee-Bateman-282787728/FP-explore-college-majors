3055709,1,B0010YSDA4,"I read the reviews of the other viewers, ""What movie did they watch""? ""Kings of the Sun"" was so bad I almost turned it off! It was typical of the times it was produced, but I see now why I've never heard of it because they probably never released it. The acting was terrible, the outfits were plastic and from outer space. It had no historic value at all, the actors must have been laughing between takes. Yul Brynner was a genius as ever, great actor as usual and the only part of the movie that held it together. I'll put it in my bad movie section.",1207872000,8,551,4.158878504672897
3055710,5,B0010YSDA4,"I saw this movie over the Christmas Holidays of 1963 and it was really good.  I was in love with George Chakiris and ALWAYS wanted to see his movies.  He and Yul Brynner made several together but his career never went anywhere after ""WEST SIDE STORY""!  Action Drama for the time and very interesting seeing Native Americans of Central America interacting (war, peace and romance), and who would get the woman.

3055711,3,B0010YSDA4,"The way they made ""big"" movies before computers.  But, the transfer seems to need a little work.  In several scenes the dark backgound appears to wash-out a bit and there is a very visable film rip during the closing shot that should have been easy to repair. I don't know why MGM seems to fall short again and again on producing pristine transfers.

Highlight is the Elmer Bernstein score.

3055712,4,B0010YSDA4,"Yul Brynner makes Gerard Butler look like gravy. Perhaps Brynner, in the best shape of his life, gives a larger than life, fierce, explosive performance in his portrayal of 'Black Eagle', the king of the tribe of hunters. It's just amazing to see him in a role almost suited for him in every fashion.

This historical drama, more or less about who has the right to land, (sound familiar), offers a nice combo of Mayan/Indian life and the villages are quite impressive to say the least.

I saw this movie for the first time about 40 years ago and it is one that stands out in my memory. Yul Brynner plays an Indian and his characterization is well done.

3055715,4,B0010YSDA4,"Here's an obscure, highly original adventure story that's better than APOCALYPTO and PATHFINDER put together!  A United Artists release from the 60's, it's a macho field day for Brynner, who plays a native North American butting heads with the Mayas - particularly chieftan Chakiris.  It's eccentric matinee fun, nicely staged, beautifully shot and filled with a pulsating, trademark score by the great Elmer Bernstein.  An out-of-print, letterboxed DVD was available in Japan, but this MGM DVD is the first time this picture has been viewed in anamorphic Panavision since it's theatrical run.

I remember the first time I saw it when it was originally released -- I could spot the zippers on George's costumes, and seeing it now the zipper-bumps are more evident.  The makeup department must have brought in gallons of M.Factor bronze pancake.  It must have taken the sweaty extras hours to shower at the end of the day(s), although the multitude of Mazatlan natives obviously had a good start being in the sun already.  'Wish I could say the same for gorgeous George, in quite a few shots he looked pale. Shirley Anne was horribly miscast.  She seemed stiff not steamy sexy.  Oh well, it could have been her nipples showing beneath her ""home spun"" costumes in some scenes ... and her azure blue eyes.  Couldn't the makeup folk have sprung for some brown contact lenses?

3055761,3,B0010YSDA4,"In this film a group of Mayans flee the Yucatan after being invaded by ""barbarians"" equipped with metal weapons. Arriving in large fishing boats off the future Gulf Coast of the U.S. they attempt to rebuild their society along the same lines as the one they knew in Mesoamerica... complete with human sacrifices. Unfortunately for Black Eagle, a native American of an indeterminate tribe, he is to be the first sacrifice in this ""new world.""

Not the best movie I've ever seen, to say the least. The plot certainly had potential and Yul Brynner (who plays Black Eagle) puts on an excellent performance, but there are so many things that don't make any sense. For one thing, how is it that Black Eagle speaks Mayan? He is captured after watching the Mayans for a few days but he must have picked up quite a vocabulary to be able to discuss philosophy and religion with his captors. Also, they talk about buffalo... weren't buffalos confined to the plains? I don't think there were any east of the Mississippi (unless Columbus killed them all later). The Indians lived in teepees, but teepees weren't used in the South. Were the Indians supposed to be Cherokee or Creek or plains Indians or what? Or are all Indians the same and it just doesn't matter? The romantic interplay between the Mayan King, the princess and the Indian Chief is just a bunch of interpersonal angst.

The director attempts to do some artful use of shadow and light but the effect is more annoying than anything else. Still, if you suspend disbelief and look at it as an adventure film it's not that bad.",1410480000,,1575,4.661870503597123

3055770,4,B0010YSDA4,"OK, let's deal with the bad, first: (1) We have a Russian playing a Native American chief, a Greek playing a Mayan king, and a lovely blue-eyed Brit playing a Mayan princess.  Welcome to Hollywood, 1963.  (2) The historical errors both large and small are so egregious and numerous it isn't even fun keeping track of them.  Welcome to Hollywood, even today.  (3) Everyone is having a bad wig day (except for Yul).  So it goes.  Now the good news:  (1) Yul Brynner (yes, that's   - he was Russian) is absolutely electric in every scene. If you liked him at his royal best in ""The King & I,"" check him out at his primitive best in this flick (although he brings more than a little of King Mongkut into this role... what do you expect, he played Mongkut over 4,000 times on Broadway). And (3) The story is epic, beautifully filmed, and even touching if you can put aside all the improbabilities.  4 stars, easy.  Final note:  Although the storyline was wholly imaginary in 1963, it turns out to have some accuracy:  we now know the Mayans DID cross the Gulf of Mexico to trade with our own norte-americano natives ... not once, but many times.  And ultimately that's what I love best about this offbeat and sort of brave flick: our ancient forebears didn't just count sheep or wander around for millennnia, or depend upon some 'ancient astronauts' to do the big jobs... they were adventurous and innovative on their own, well beyond what we are taught in school, and their world was damn near as big as ours.",1365120000,3,1505,4.525925925925926
3055771,5,B0010YSDA4,"This movie showed both sides of two tribes one in Mayan order and the other for Native Americans.  How one king runs to save his culture/people from enemies.  The American Indians have already fought for their land, and feel the need to continue when the Mayan's come to their land.  During the movie, there are conflicts between the chiefs and a love interest.
Great story about warriors, their cultures and their friendships.",1365033600,,427,4.902777777777778
3055772,4,B0010YSDA4,"I remember this movie from the first time I saw it as a young teen.  I vaguely remembered the plot.  What I most remembered was Yul Brynner.  He stole the show.  He didn't walk, he strutted, he prowled, he oozed masculine sensuality. Needless to say, I was absolutely smitten.  So I was ecstatic when I saw it had been re-released and on DVD. Yes the movie itself is corny. It is not history.  And those wigs!  They were so awful, you could almost see the actors straining to keep straight faces and deliver their lines.  But it's worth it just to watch Yul.",1364774400,3,558,4.349514563106796
3055773,5,B0010YSDA4,"Easily one of the best pictures done by either of the stars, Brynner or Chikaris. This is a historically accurate story of the pre-European Americas.

It begins in middle Mexico and quickly moves to The Louisiana/Texas borderlands on the Gulf of Mexico.

Chikaris is the young king of an Aztec like tribe in central Mexico. He is chased out of his homeland by an invading native army. He and his people run to the coast where he agrees to marry a local tribe's headman's daughter in exchange for their fishing boats.

Turns out the daughter doesn't like being bartered and refuses to marry under those conditions.

Enter Brynner as a local North American Indian chief who doesn't like his country invaded by this southern tribe.

He is captured while spying on the new people, falls for the chief's unwed bride, and thereby hangs the tale.

A good script, well acted, directed and produced. The special effects are appropriate to the time depicted, and breathtaking scenery add to the films effectiveness.

I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who enjoys movies on American Indians, early, pre-European American history, native customs, or the actors who star and support this excellent story.",1363996800,2,1194,4.969849246231155

If you don't look for authenticity you'll be much happier, although those feather capes may be somewhat accurate. I thought the whole thing dragged until Yul Brynner appeared, although there were action sequences and movement at the beginning, Brynner was the reason I got this DVD. So consider this: he spent almmost the entire movie wearing the equivalent of a small bathing suit and a couple of flaps of cloth, and he was pretty buff. At the point where you see him as a captive being taken care of by the heroine, you realize this is a chick flick and he's the eye candy. Seriously, you certainly can think about the story on a lot of different levels, but I don't really think that was the primary reason they made this movie. Most of the rest of the men strut (or try to strut) around in pseudo-Mayan costumes, while Brynner is comfortable in whatever he wears - or doesn't, in this case.

If only every world political leader, religious leader and even community leaders could heed the lessons from this film.  It's a powerful reminder of the importance of laying aside hatred and replacing it with tolerance.  We can belong to different tribes and cultures and yet view those differences as opportunities to learn from each other without having to resort to racism, bigotry and war. The film also teaches us that religion can be good, but we shouldn't fear putting aside old beliefs that no longer serve us and which only cause harm and injury to others in the name of God.

NEAT!! Love the fact that although they have been adrift for an interminable amount of time they land in a place where the natives speak the same language.

3055782,2,B0010YSDA4,"I saw ""Kings of the Sun"" as a kid and became fascinated by Mayans. I recently watched it for the first time in 40 years, and I must confess it did not live up to my childhood memory. The story follows a tribe of Mayans who flee their homeland to North America, where they encounter a tribe of Native Americans. The two groups start out as adversaries, with the two leaders pursuing the same woman, but they ultimately come together to fight an invading army.

A big problem with the film is the casting. Most of the main actors don't look remotely like Central American Indians. The female lead, Shirley Anne Field, is paler than the sands they build their village on. She is a wooden mannequin with limited emotional range. Richard Basehart, as a Mayan priest, looks out of place in his swept up hairdo and fancy headdresses. Playing the Mayan ruler, George Chakiris is effectively chiseled, but comes across more like a fashion model. Mostly he stands around glowering. Only Yul Brynner looks the part, as Native American chief Black Eagle. Brynner has a dynamic physical presence, striding around with sinewy grace.

The direction is slow and ponderous, and the story gives only a surface look at the Mayan culture. The love story isn't convincing since the actress is so bland you can't believe two chieftains would battle for her affection. The musical score, by Elmer Bernstein, is bombastic but repetitive. The climactic battle has some good moments, but it's too little too late.

I wanted to like this movie, but found it a dull disappointment. Without Yul Brynner, it would have been a total dud.",1256688000,7,1606,4.76978417266187

I thought it was great. The best part was no bad language or foul words that didn't exist in those days. It's kinda nice not having to listen to 4 letter words that do not inprove a movie.

Some of us at the age of 10, remember seeing previews on television on a movie that looks so cool to see. Well this was one of them. I remember cutting grass to get the 75 cents to go to the Roxy Theatre to see this film. I was not disapointed. Again, with this new DVD, I am not disapointed. The Elmer Bernstien music opens up and a great smile comes on my face. The DVD transfer is spectacular and the colors vibrant. Yul Brynner strolls across the screen with tough and gentle masculinity. The action of the film is epic and contained perfectly within it's 2:35 wideescreen lens. This movie was played with Steve Reeves film ""The Slave"" aka ""Son of Spartacus"". We must have stayed all day at the Roxy...it was 9:00pm when we walked home. A day well spent and a day to remember. So will you...if you can remember.",1247356800,6,896,4.37125748502994
3055786,2,B0010YSDA4,"I'd love to give this movie a good review. I really enjoyed Appocalypto. But this film is less a story of the people/tribes involved and more a love triangle story with Brynner, Chikiris and the female lead. Nothing wrong with that, but the stroy itself is rather light weight when it could have been much more. Chikiris looks like he just stepped off the stage from West Side Story and put on a tunic. He is a good actor, but not well cast as a Mayan chief. He looks like Frankie Avalon. Brynner is great as Black Eagle the Native American chief. He salvages the movie. Richard Basehart as the Mayan high priest? Looks ridiculous. Why not use real indian actors? Then there's the story. A Mayan tribe goes to sea to escape a homeland invader. They land in a Gulf Coast area, perhaps Lousiiana and re-settle. Ok, that could happen. But then they are pursued by their enemy. Not likely. The native american tribe and the Mayans both speak the same language. Not likely. Mayans with swords and catapults??? Never heard of such a thing. There are a lot of historical gaps here, but if all you want is some light weight entertainment and a chance to see Yul Bryner at the top of his craft, it's worth a watch.",1247270400,4,1205,4.457013574660634
3055787,4,B0010YSDA4,"""Kings of the Sun"" is the story of an adventure that probably never happened, but would have been great if it did: A Maya king flees his homeland and a bloodthirsty enemy, in a fleet and lands north enough to encounter native Americans of which Brynner is the chief, Black Eagle, a charismatic leader that tries to negotiate a pact with the refugee nation and bond with their beautiful, blue-eyed princess, Ixchel (Anne Field).

George Chakiris plays Balam, the Maya, king, Black Eagle's rival for her affections,  and son of kings to the ninth generation. In spite of being young and impetuous, Chakiris lacks the flair and commanding presence for the role. He is also strapped with a shirt that looks like a Fendi creation for the first scenes and with a jade armour in the war scenes that looks uncomfortably plastic, and which offer little competition for Brynner's virile sensuality in his shirtless and tight Indian pants costume.

A good comparison between these two Indian chiefs,  brings to mind another Bryner classic hunk to hunk competition: It is hard to concentrate on Charles Heston's Moses in the Ten Commandments while Bryner's Ramses is in the same scene wearing a magnificent collar-necklace and pretty much nothingelse. Keeping the shaved head look as his trademark for this exotic epic,  Brynner yet again steals the show with his macho antics, and 'barbaric' demeanor, at one point climbing a tree with the suppleness of a panther. This movie is clearly a vehicle for his star personality and it outshines all the other players and if you are a Brynner fan, this is a must-see movie.

The movie is great fun, but highly inaccurate in the historical aspects, although the costumes and architecture have been finely reproduced for the most part, the viewer must see Mel Gibson's ""Apocalypto"" for a more authentic version of the period, still considering other Holywood creations of the time, this is almost scholarly. The opening scenes inside a Maya pyramid are fascinating for the creativity involved in making an entire army attend a funeral and escape into the fields through a secret tunnel while the top pf the pyramid is being assulted by the crazed Hunac Kell.

Richard Basehart is the high priest, and the other major character. He tries to make the king understand that he cannot bring this new life to his people in a new land, without giving a life (human sacrifice) But Balam is ready to change the theology of his nation under the influence of Black Eagle and the desire for peace, so the priest takes his own life in a dramatic moment at the top of the recently constructed pyramid.

Leo Gordon is awful as the tyrant Hunac Kell, the bllodthirsty enemy of Balam and his people. He sounds like a marine gone bezerk while wearing the wrong costume. His strength is a sword of metal, a historical impossibility as  the Maya or for that matter Mesoamerican cultures did not use metal for their weapons prior to the arrival of the Spanish Conquistadors.

Filmed beautifully around real Mexican pyramids, lucious vegetation and sandy beaches with perfect surf, Thompson's motion picture is colorful and highly entertaining. Strongly recomended for action film lovers of historical extravaganzas.",1247097600,6,3224,4.942698706099815

Everybody speaks good English and they understand easily each others. One has to wait perhaps too long for the final battle which is O.K. and there is not much blood, which is good for my taste. Only rarely I have seen so many real people as in this film. This is he major asset of this film. I do not know if Brynner is a great actor but he has always a wonderful presence.

Keeping the Buddhist monk hairstyle as his trademark, Brynner easily steals the show with his virile personality, distinctive look, speech and mannerism... He is Black Eagle, the barbarian chief who comes to the defense of the Mayans...

George Chakiris plays Balam, the jaguar, king and son of kings to the ninth generation... Although in spite of being young and brave and untried, Chakiris lacks the heroic stature with which the role might have been satisfied...

Shirley Anne Field is the delicate Ixchel who would never leave Black Eagle except if he ever used to tell her that he loved her...

Richard Basehart is the high priest who tried to make the king understand that he cannot bring this new life to his people without giving a life... For a thousand years they've been bound by this law... The gods cannot be cheated...

3055794,5,B0010YSDA4,"Kings of the Sun, a 1963 movie starring Yul Brynner and George Chakiris is another classic not to be missed. We acquired this movie because we are die-hard fans of Mr. Brynner, who born on July 11th, 1920, lived to the age of 65, when he died of lung cancer. A Russian-born actor, Yul Brynner brought magic to the screen in roles as the King... in the King and I, ""The Magnificent Seven"" and in his unforgettable performance as Rameses II in the epic ""The Ten Commandments.""

Those of us who admire Yul Brynner can not forget and truly miss the grand figure, the deep voice and his exotic looks, for he brought elegance and presence to men with shaven heads.

In this movie, Brynner again delights with his star power as he plays the role of ruler of an indigenous nomadic American civilization. The story starts with ancient members of the Mayan civilization fleeing their kingdom because they are persecuted by a tribe with more advanced weapons.

Balam is the son of the king of this group who believes in human sacrifice to prosper. You see they are wise and have thought of many interesting ways to protect themselves, for as they escape, they do so through an elaborate sequence of secret passages that allow them enough time to go to the shore, where they meet villagers with boats they take, setting out to unknown lands.

The villagers want nothing to do with Balam, but they understand he is being followed by men who will not hesitate to kill them, and the leader of the village makes Balam promise that if they give them the boats, he will marry and make his daughter their queen.

Ixchel, beautifully played by Shirley Anne Field is upset that her father has made Balam agree to marry her because she wants to marry for love.

They set out to sea and arrive at what appears to be uninhabited lands, and soon they set out to build homes, recreating their previous way of life, but this time, in the absence of human sacrifice, something that Balam dislikes.

They are so advanced that they record their history through artisans that carve the tribe story onto walls and trees. Balam is a bit of an engineer and an architect and we see him creating dams to benefit from river waters to irrigate fields to plant crops and have food available for their people.

But, there are people that live on this land, and Yul Brynner enters as the ruler of the nomadic tribe, Black Eagle, who upon discovering ships by the shore, travels to discover those that arrived on his land.  Black Eagle attacks Balam and is wounded, taken prisoner, and tended to in preparation for human sacrifice to the Gods.

Ixchel nurses Black Eagle back to health and when he discovers that it was all in preparation to be killed, he tells them that superstition is wrong, that the preservation of life is the essence of civilization, and both Black Eagle and Balam begin to learn much from the other's point of view.

The plot thickens and without giving away the story, Yul Brynner achieves much in changing Balam as he realizes that Balam has wisdom, knowledge, and much that his nomadic tribe can benefit from. Hunac Ceel, played by Leo Gordon follows Balam to the new land, and attacks them... Will the tribe survive? Well... Black Eagle and Balam join forces and you will see magnificent lessons on how to accept change to foster an environment of peace. Without a doubt, a magnificent film, great performances, and another classic to enjoy with friends and family!

According to my reading on Ancient Mexico, there was a conqueror named Hunac Ceel(but I don't think he died somewhere on the Texas-Louisania coast). The time period looks around 800-1000AD, and there were temple mounds along the Mississippi-Ohio-Missouri rivers at about that time. Those cultures received at least some influence from the south. Maybe a refugee group of Maya did reach the Gulf Coast. The movie ends with a hint that was indeed the case. The Maya also conducted a coastal trade along the Gulf using canoes with 30-50 rowers, so the story has some factual basis(although using sails is in dispute).
  I first saw this movie when it was released in 1963, and it started a personal interest in the Maya and other groups in preColumbian America. I was really happy to finally get a copy.",1219017600,,847,4.755102040816326

As per usual habit of the people at MGM/UA though, there is not very much about special inserts. Also, the sound is not very special. Just a lame Mono or Stereo sound, which seems to be their specialty for most of their titles, unless naturally, treated by someone else (see the Sony treated James Bond Collection and you see what I mean).

Only thing that indeed got a vast improvement is the image. Crystal clear and in the correct widescreen format (for those who actually like the black bars on top and at the bottom of their screens).

The story is not very accurate and takes many liberties with Mayan and Toltech history.

It is, after all, just an adventure movie, with just a hint of historic background intertwined in its plot.

3055803,5,B0010YSDA4,"Having been given a home video release years earlier in Asia of all places, KINGS OF THE SUN finally arrives on these shores.  If you're expecting plenty of extras and a really pristine print, unfortunately this is not the case as noted by other reviewers.  But we do have a great action/adventure from British director J. Lee Thompson fresh off completing TARAS BULBA with the same star Yul Brynner. Now theres plenty of stunt action in this picture with hundreds of extras and so on, but the added bonus is the pulsating music score of master maestro Elmer Bernstein. In fact as he said himself on a TCM TV screening with Robert Osborne, it's his most requested score by his loyal fans. He was about to re-record the score before he died, but it never happened.

Shot on location on the beaches of Mazatlan and at the Mayan city of Chichen Itza in the Yucatan of Mexico back in 1963, you just know that there are plenty of beach resort hotels spoiling the same views these days. It's a B-movie story that is livened by the action, music, great photography of Joe MacDonald and the uncredited narration of James Coburn, years before he found a retirement career voicing commercials.
It's Yul Brynner's picture for sure and it's his last iconic period piece prior to finally playing the robot gunslinger in WESTWORLD. George Chakiris is passable coming off WEST SIDE STORY, but Shirley Anne Field and her heavy British accent is way miscast.

3290258,3,B0010YSDA4,"In this film a group of Mayans flee the Yucatan after being invaded by ""barbarians"" equipped with metal weapons. Arriving in large fishing boats off the future Gulf Coast of the U.S. they attempt to rebuild their society along the same lines as the one they knew in Mesoamerica... complete with human sacrifices. Unfortunately for Black Eagle, a native American of an indeterminate tribe, he is to be the first sacrifice in this ""new world.""

Not the best movie I've ever seen, to say the least. The plot certainly had potential and Yul Brynner (who plays Black Eagle) puts on an excellent performance, but there are so many things that don't make any sense. For one thing, how is it that Black Eagle speaks Mayan? He is captured after watching the Mayans for a few days but he must have picked up quite a vocabulary to be able to discuss philosophy and religion with his captors. Also, they talk about buffalo... weren't buffalos confined to the plains? I don't think there were any east of the Mississippi (unless Columbus killed them all later). The Indians lived in teepees, but teepees weren't used in the South. Were the Indians supposed to be Cherokee or Creek or plains Indians or what? Or are all Indians the same and it just doesn't matter? The romantic interplay between the Mayan King, the princess and the Indian Chief is just a bunch of interpersonal angst.

The director attempts to do some artful use of shadow and light but the effect is more annoying than anything else. Still, if you suspend disbelief and look at it as an adventure film it's not that bad.",1410480000,,1575,4.661870503597123

3290267,4,B0010YSDA4,"OK, let's deal with the bad, first: (1) We have a Russian playing a Native American chief, a Greek playing a Mayan king, and a lovely blue-eyed Brit playing a Mayan princess.  Welcome to Hollywood, 1963.  (2) The historical errors both large and small are so egregious and numerous it isn't even fun keeping track of them.  Welcome to Hollywood, even today.  (3) Everyone is having a bad wig day (except for Yul).  So it goes.  Now the good news:  (1) Yul Brynner (yes, that's   - he was Russian) is absolutely electric in every scene. If you liked him at his royal best in ""The King & I,"" check him out at his primitive best in this flick (although he brings more than a little of King Mongkut into this role... what do you expect, he played Mongkut over 4,000 times on Broadway). And (3) The story is epic, beautifully filmed, and even touching if you can put aside all the improbabilities.  4 stars, easy.  Final note:  Although the storyline was wholly imaginary in 1963, it turns out to have some accuracy:  we now know the Mayans DID cross the Gulf of Mexico to trade with our own norte-americano natives ... not once, but many times.  And ultimately that's what I love best about this offbeat and sort of brave flick: our ancient forebears didn't just count sheep or wander around for millennnia, or depend upon some 'ancient astronauts' to do the big jobs... they were adventurous and innovative on their own, well beyond what we are taught in school, and their world was damn near as big as ours.",1365120000,3,1505,4.525925925925926

Yes the movie itself is corny. It is not history.  And those wigs!  They were so awful, you could almost see the actors straining to keep straight faces and deliver their lines.

3290270,5,B0010YSDA4,"Easily one of the best pictures done by either of the stars, Brynner or Chikaris. This is a historically accurate story of the pre-European Americas.

It begins in middle Mexico and quickly moves to The Louisiana/Texas borderlands on the Gulf of Mexico.

Chikaris is the young king of an Aztec like tribe in central Mexico. He is chased out of his homeland by an invading native army. He and his people run to the coast where he agrees to marry a local tribe's headman's daughter in exchange for their fishing boats.

Turns out the daughter doesn't like being bartered and refuses to marry under those conditions.

Enter Brynner as a local North American Indian chief who doesn't like his country invaded by this southern tribe.

He is captured while spying on the new people, falls for the chief's unwed bride, and thereby hangs the tale.

A good script, well acted, directed and produced. The special effects are appropriate to the time depicted, and breathtaking scenery add to the films effectiveness.

I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who enjoys movies on American Indians, early, pre-European American history, native customs, or the actors who star and support this excellent story.",1363996800,2,1194,4.969849246231155

If you don't look for authenticity you'll be much happier, although those feather capes may be somewhat accurate. I thought the whole thing dragged until Yul Brynner appeared, although there were action sequences and movement at the beginning, Brynner was the reason I got this DVD. So consider this: he spent almmost the entire movie wearing the equivalent of a small bathing suit and a couple of flaps of cloth, and he was pretty buff. At the point where you see him as a captive being taken care of by the heroine, you realize this is a chick flick and he's the eye candy. Seriously, you certainly can think about the story on a lot of different levels, but I don't really think that was the primary reason they made this movie. Most of the rest of the men strut (or try to strut) around in pseudo-Mayan costumes, while Brynner is comfortable in whatever he wears - or doesn't, in this case.

It's a powerful reminder of the importance of laying aside hatred and replacing it with tolerance.  We can belong to different tribes and cultures and yet view those differences as opportunities to learn from each other without having to resort to racism, bigotry and war. The film also teaches us that religion can be good, but we shouldn't fear putting aside old beliefs that no longer serve us and which only cause harm and injury to others in the name of God.

3290279,2,B0010YSDA4,"I saw ""Kings of the Sun"" as a kid and became fascinated by Mayans. I recently watched it for the first time in 40 years, and I must confess it did not live up to my childhood memory. The story follows a tribe of Mayans who flee their homeland to North America, where they encounter a tribe of Native Americans. The two groups start out as adversaries, with the two leaders pursuing the same woman, but they ultimately come together to fight an invading army.

A big problem with the film is the casting. Most of the main actors don't look remotely like Central American Indians. The female lead, Shirley Anne Field, is paler than the sands they build their village on. She is a wooden mannequin with limited emotional range. Richard Basehart, as a Mayan priest, looks out of place in his swept up hairdo and fancy headdresses. Playing the Mayan ruler, George Chakiris is effectively chiseled, but comes across more like a fashion model. Mostly he stands around glowering. Only Yul Brynner looks the part, as Native American chief Black Eagle. Brynner has a dynamic physical presence, striding around with sinewy grace.

The direction is slow and ponderous, and the story gives only a surface look at the Mayan culture. The love story isn't convincing since the actress is so bland you can't believe two chieftains would battle for her affection. The musical score, by Elmer Bernstein, is bombastic but repetitive. The climactic battle has some good moments, but it's too little too late.

I wanted to like this movie, but found it a dull disappointment. Without Yul Brynner, it would have been a total dud.",1256688000,7,1606,4.76978417266187

The Elmer Bernstien music opens up and a great smile comes on my face. The DVD transfer is spectacular and the colors vibrant. Yul Brynner strolls across the screen with tough and gentle masculinity. The action of the film is epic and contained perfectly within it's 2:35 wideescreen lens. This movie was played with Steve Reeves film ""The Slave"" aka ""Son of Spartacus"".

3290283,2,B0010YSDA4,"I'd love to give this movie a good review. I really enjoyed Appocalypto. But this film is less a story of the people/tribes involved and more a love triangle story with Brynner, Chikiris and the female lead. Nothing wrong with that, but the stroy itself is rather light weight when it could have been much more. Chikiris looks like he just stepped off the stage from West Side Story and put on a tunic. He is a good actor, but not well cast as a Mayan chief. He looks like Frankie Avalon. Brynner is great as Black Eagle the Native American chief. He salvages the movie. Richard Basehart as the Mayan high priest? Looks ridiculous. Why not use real indian actors? Then there's the story. A Mayan tribe goes to sea to escape a homeland invader. They land in a Gulf Coast area, perhaps Lousiiana and re-settle. Ok, that could happen. But then they are pursued by their enemy. Not likely. The native american tribe and the Mayans both speak the same language. Not likely. Mayans with swords and catapults??? Never heard of such a thing. There are a lot of historical gaps here, but if all you want is some light weight entertainment and a chance to see Yul Bryner at the top of his craft, it's worth a watch.",1247270400,4,1205,4.457013574660634
3290284,4,B0010YSDA4,"""Kings of the Sun"" is the story of an adventure that probably never happened, but would have been great if it did: A Maya king flees his homeland and a bloodthirsty enemy, in a fleet and lands north enough to encounter native Americans of which Brynner is the chief, Black Eagle, a charismatic leader that tries to negotiate a pact with the refugee nation and bond with their beautiful, blue-eyed princess, Ixchel (Anne Field).

George Chakiris plays Balam, the Maya, king, Black Eagle's rival for her affections,  and son of kings to the ninth generation. In spite of being young and impetuous, Chakiris lacks the flair and commanding presence for the role. He is also strapped with a shirt that looks like a Fendi creation for the first scenes and with a jade armour in the war scenes that looks uncomfortably plastic, and which offer little competition for Brynner's virile sensuality in his shirtless and tight Indian pants costume.

A good comparison between these two Indian chiefs,  brings to mind another Bryner classic hunk to hunk competition: It is hard to concentrate on Charles Heston's Moses in the Ten Commandments while Bryner's Ramses is in the same scene wearing a magnificent collar-necklace and pretty much nothingelse. Keeping the shaved head look as his trademark for this exotic epic,  Brynner yet again steals the show with his macho antics, and 'barbaric' demeanor, at one point climbing a tree with the suppleness of a panther. This movie is clearly a vehicle for his star personality and it outshines all the other players and if you are a Brynner fan, this is a must-see movie.

The movie is great fun, but highly inaccurate in the historical aspects, although the costumes and architecture have been finely reproduced for the most part, the viewer must see Mel Gibson's ""Apocalypto"" for a more authentic version of the period, still considering other Holywood creations of the time, this is almost scholarly. The opening scenes inside a Maya pyramid are fascinating for the creativity involved in making an entire army attend a funeral and escape into the fields through a secret tunnel while the top pf the pyramid is being assulted by the crazed Hunac Kell.

Richard Basehart is the high priest, and the other major character. He tries to make the king understand that he cannot bring this new life to his people in a new land, without giving a life (human sacrifice) But Balam is ready to change the theology of his nation under the influence of Black Eagle and the desire for peace, so the priest takes his own life in a dramatic moment at the top of the recently constructed pyramid.

Leo Gordon is awful as the tyrant Hunac Kell, the bllodthirsty enemy of Balam and his people. He sounds like a marine gone bezerk while wearing the wrong costume. His strength is a sword of metal, a historical impossibility as  the Maya or for that matter Mesoamerican cultures did not use metal for their weapons prior to the arrival of the Spanish Conquistadors.

Filmed beautifully around real Mexican pyramids, lucious vegetation and sandy beaches with perfect surf, Thompson's motion picture is colorful and highly entertaining. Strongly recomended for action film lovers of historical extravaganzas.",1247097600,6,3224,4.942698706099815

3290291,5,B0010YSDA4,"Kings of the Sun, a 1963 movie starring Yul Brynner and George Chakiris is another classic not to be missed. We acquired this movie because we are die-hard fans of Mr. Brynner, who born on July 11th, 1920, lived to the age of 65, when he died of lung cancer. A Russian-born actor, Yul Brynner brought magic to the screen in roles as the King... in the King and I, ""The Magnificent Seven"" and in his unforgettable performance as Rameses II in the epic ""The Ten Commandments.""

Those of us who admire Yul Brynner can not forget and truly miss the grand figure, the deep voice and his exotic looks, for he brought elegance and presence to men with shaven heads.

In this movie, Brynner again delights with his star power as he plays the role of ruler of an indigenous nomadic American civilization. The story starts with ancient members of the Mayan civilization fleeing their kingdom because they are persecuted by a tribe with more advanced weapons.

Balam is the son of the king of this group who believes in human sacrifice to prosper. You see they are wise and have thought of many interesting ways to protect themselves, for as they escape, they do so through an elaborate sequence of secret passages that allow them enough time to go to the shore, where they meet villagers with boats they take, setting out to unknown lands.

The villagers want nothing to do with Balam, but they understand he is being followed by men who will not hesitate to kill them, and the leader of the village makes Balam promise that if they give them the boats, he will marry and make his daughter their queen.

Ixchel, beautifully played by Shirley Anne Field is upset that her father has made Balam agree to marry her because she wants to marry for love.

They set out to sea and arrive at what appears to be uninhabited lands, and soon they set out to build homes, recreating their previous way of life, but this time, in the absence of human sacrifice, something that Balam dislikes.

They are so advanced that they record their history through artisans that carve the tribe story onto walls and trees. Balam is a bit of an engineer and an architect and we see him creating dams to benefit from river waters to irrigate fields to plant crops and have food available for their people.

But, there are people that live on this land, and Yul Brynner enters as the ruler of the nomadic tribe, Black Eagle, who upon discovering ships by the shore, travels to discover those that arrived on his land.  Black Eagle attacks Balam and is wounded, taken prisoner, and tended to in preparation for human sacrifice to the Gods.

Ixchel nurses Black Eagle back to health and when he discovers that it was all in preparation to be killed, he tells them that superstition is wrong, that the preservation of life is the essence of civilization, and both Black Eagle and Balam begin to learn much from the other's point of view.

The plot thickens and without giving away the story, Yul Brynner achieves much in changing Balam as he realizes that Balam has wisdom, knowledge, and much that his nomadic tribe can benefit from. Hunac Ceel, played by Leo Gordon follows Balam to the new land, and attacks them... Will the tribe survive? Well... Black Eagle and Balam join forces and you will see magnificent lessons on how to accept change to foster an environment of peace. Without a doubt, a magnificent film, great performances, and another classic to enjoy with friends and family!

The tale assumes the viewers know about the whys and whynots of human sacrifice, so it's really not necessary to explore it further. In my humble opinion, it is a movie that deserves a place on your DVD shelf if you love action, period pieces, or Yul. I'm glad to have it.",1225065600,3,613,4.433628318584071

3290294,5,B0010YSDA4,"Kings of the Sun has a lot of historic maybes. According to my reading on Ancient Mexico, there was a conqueror named Hunac Ceel(but I don't think he died somewhere on the Texas-Louisania coast). The time period looks around 800-1000AD, and there were temple mounds along the Mississippi-Ohio-Missouri rivers at about that time. Those cultures received at least some influence from the south. Maybe a refugee group of Maya did reach the Gulf Coast. The movie ends with a hint that was indeed the case. The Maya also conducted a coastal trade along the Gulf using canoes with 30-50 rowers, so the story has some factual basis(although using sails is in dispute).
  I first saw this movie when it was released in 1963, and it started a personal interest in the Maya and other groups in preColumbian America. I was really happy to finally get a copy.",1219017600,,847,4.755102040816326
3290295,4,B0010YSDA4,"I received this DVD quickly and it was in fine shape - no problems.

However, the picture and sound quality were not as good as I expected.
It is about as good as high quality VHS.

5 star transaction though.",1216166400,2,208,4.175
3290296,5,B0010YSDA4,"It is a very possible story.  It happens before any white man set his footprints on Texas. Outstanding story, excellent actors. I highly recommend this movie.",1214179200,,158,5.076923076923077
3290297,4,B0010YSDA4,"For years I was condemned to watch this movie on an old VHS tape, in Pan & Scan (aaargh), but now, finally we have it in glorious Cinemascope.

As per usual habit of the people at MGM/UA though, there is not very much about special inserts. Also, the sound is not very special. Just a lame Mono or Stereo sound, which seems to be their specialty for most of their titles, unless naturally, treated by someone else (see the Sony treated James Bond Collection and you see what I mean).

Only thing that indeed got a vast improvement is the image. Crystal clear and in the correct widescreen format (for those who actually like the black bars on top and at the bottom of their screens).

The story is not very accurate and takes many liberties with Mayan and Toltech history.

It is, after all, just an adventure movie, with just a hint of historic background intertwined in its plot.
But who would like to miss out on a Yul Brynner movie?

Now, if only they would release ""The Ultimate Warrior"" on DVD, also starring Yul Brynner, in a perhaps more potent role, then I would really be satisfied...",1214006400,11,1094,4.477386934673367

still love it... If you are 25 years old or less, please take in consideration the year the movie was made. There was no CGI in those days,
actors/actresses physically worked for a living and it was not a blue/green screen world. These types of movies were rare, as most movies
dealts with guns/crime/war/murder.
So when a big adventure movie came up we jumped on it and ...this movie
looked big...big cast...pyramids....it was a kid's dream....
So today the movie still hold, is entertaining and Yule never looked better.",1210032000,20,594,4.721153846153846
3290300,5,B0010YSDA4,"Having been given a home video release years earlier in Asia of all places, KINGS OF THE SUN finally arrives on these shores.  If you're expecting plenty of extras and a really pristine print, unfortunately this is not the case as noted by other reviewers.  But we do have a great action/adventure from British director J. Lee Thompson fresh off completing TARAS BULBA with the same star Yul Brynner. Now theres plenty of stunt action in this picture with hundreds of extras and so on, but the added bonus is the pulsating music score of master maestro Elmer Bernstein. In fact as he said himself on a TCM TV screening with Robert Osborne, it's his most requested score by his loyal fans. He was about to re-record the score before he died, but it never happened.

Shot on location on the beaches of Mazatlan and at the Mayan city of Chichen Itza in the Yucatan of Mexico back in 1963, you just know that there are plenty of beach resort hotels spoiling the same views these days. It's a B-movie story that is livened by the action, music, great photography of Joe MacDonald and the uncredited narration of James Coburn, years before he found a retirement career voicing commercials.
It's Yul Brynner's picture for sure and it's his last iconic period piece prior to finally playing the robot gunslinger in WESTWORLD. George Chakiris is passable coming off WEST SIDE STORY, but Shirley Anne Field and her heavy British accent is way miscast. Still THE GUNS OF NAVARONE director Thompson, keeps your attention with the widescreen layout and detail of the scenes.

I personally remember seeing this in London upon it's intial release and I loved it then.  So much so, that I saw it three or four times in the theatre.",1209600000,11,1715,4.6843853820598005

But this is not really history, of course, ....just historical fiction about Maya internecine warfare, rare enough as a subject for a movie.
