2624934,5,B000GZCATI,I have been doing this Arthritis Foundation Exercise Program Workout for two months -- I started doing these exercises at my local Library once a week.  Then I bought this dvd.  It works for me... I do it almost every day.  I have Fibromaglia and it has helped me tremendously.  I am an active 60 year old.  I walk 3 miles a day weather permitting or bike 5 miles per day with a 2 mile walk included.  Use it or you will lose it.,1201564800,24,429,4.0476190476190474
2624935,5,B000GZCATI,"I am an experienced orthopedic physical therapist currently focusing on arthritis care.  This exercise program has all of the right components for the arthritis sufferer.  There are several options for people to adjust the level of intensity for them.  The music is a little hokey, but that's the only minor complaint that I have.",1184630400,33,330,5.074074074074074

2624937,4,B000GZCATI,Good exercises and instruction.  Moving from section to section was clumsy.,1462752000,,75,5.818181818181818
2624938,5,B000GZCATI,Everything I expected. Good exercising tape,1461542400,,43,6.333333333333333

2624940,3,B000GZCATI,"Not to be querulous, but I really wish that a program sponsored by the Arthritis Foundation, would be outstanding.  Yes, the DVD does a serviceable job of demonstrating important topics: range of motion, stretching, endurance and strength training.  And that's it.  For one thing, in contrast to other exercise/PT DVDs, the music background does not encourage movement.  It is very hard to move in rhythm to atonal music. Peggy Brill does an excellent, well-paced job of leading the exercises; however, the five participants are glum (It is not my intent to criticize the participants at all). The videographer focuses an inordinate amount of time on one of the participants, which becomes a distraction. Honestly, watching the DVD has become depressing, so I use the DVD every morning with my chair facing a window and pace myself listening to Peggy's directions. Nothing I can do about the insipid background music.

While I do not expect to see super smiley, energetic, fit participants moving to rap music, I fault the Arthritis Foundation with its vast financial and personnel resources for not putting more time and effort into the direction and production of a go-to DVD for millions of Americans who suffer from arthritis.",1456012800,12,1230,5.099502487562189
2624941,3,B000GZCATI,"This is a good program if you don't have any other DVD's in this genre, and I recommend previewing it if you can get it from your library.  I am sending it back, however.  I have quite a few yoga DVD's for seniors (Peggy Cappy & Jane Adams).  I also have Anne Pringle Burnell's ""Stronger Seniors"" series, and Jodi Stolove's Chair Dancing.  Most of the moves in this video are a repetition of what I already have.  I'd also like to point out that, in most exercise DVD's, when the leader is saying, ""turn to your left"", she and all of her people turn to their RIGHT, which makes it easier for the person viewing the video.  In this video, however, Ms. Brill says ""left"" and turns ""left"" (for them), which can be confusing for the viewer.  Not a big deal, but you have to get used to it.  Another thing I didn't like is that there is a rather lengthy introduction in the beginning that you cannot fast-forward through.  So you have to play it each time you start the DVD.",1452470400,10,969,4.28021978021978

2624944,5,B000GZCATI,"I was recently introduced to this video at an exercise program sponsored by the Arthritis Foundation at the senior center where I am a member.  It gently progressed through all the joints, leaving me feeling more nimble and mobile after only about half an hour.  I found the video on Amazon and decided to add it to my in-home library to use on days when it's not possible to get to the class at the center ~ for bad weather and/or other reasons.",1441756800,3,446,4.36144578313253
2624945,2,B000GZCATI,"Disappointed in this video, the floor work is totally missing from it even though it is listed as an option. It is overpriced for what you get.",1435968000,3,143,4.333333333333333
2624946,5,B000GZCATI,This video really works! It keeps me moving pain free.,1430956800,,54,4.5
2624947,5,B000GZCATI,I have now used this DVD 2 -3 X per week since I purchased it.  My Range of Motion is getting better.  I had not realize that my arthritis had decreased my movement.  The level of pain I had before was moderate which made me want to move less.  Since using this DVD I have been able to move more with less pain.  The exercises are very easy. That was what I needed at that time.  Am now using another DVD for a harder work out but I still use this before the harder DVD to increase and warm up my joints and muscles.  If someone had not introduce me to this DVD for my arthritis I would be in more pain and my range of motion would be limited.  Am grateful to have a DVD that is simple and is a good start for those of us who have limited Range of Motion,1428710400,6,754,3.8506493506493507
2624948,5,B000GZCATI,"This is an excellent workout for the entire body.  It is not hard or stressful, but it is effective right from the get go.  I am not yet doing it for the entire hour, but will work up to it.",1424822400,2,190,3.725
2624949,4,B000GZCATI,Very low impact & easy for a senior person to work with.  The program accomplishes its flexibility objective.,1421884800,2,109,5.055555555555555
2624950,5,B000GZCATI,Great transaction.  Exactly as described,1404432000,2,40,7.0
2624951,5,B000GZCATI,I started this exercise program recently and am pleasantly surprised with the results.  I feel a lot less achy and more limber.  The amazing thing is that the exercises are not at all difficult or complicated.  If you do all of it it takes a little more than an hour.  It's broken up into segments.  The only complaint is you have to go through one segment to get to another.  I wish there was a detailed menu at the beginning.  I like the woman instructor.  She has a very pleasant way and voice.  It's very relaxing actually and I feel more upbeat when I'm finished.,1377561600,8,568,4.333333333333333
2624952,5,B000GZCATI,"This exercise program is based on the Arthritis Foundation exercise progam. Great stretch and strength building excercises,and relaxing techniques. This program is divided into easy to follow sections. Very good for those just begining an exercise program.",1349913600,8,256,5.945945945945946
2624953,5,B000GZCATI,"I used to have this exercise video on VHS, and I've now bought the DVD.  Some of the exercises are the same or just a little tweaked as the ones I did in physical therapy after my knee replacements, due to severe arthritis.  I had both knees replaced a year apart, and then the next year I had a right total shoulder replacement.  If I don't keep my knees limbered up by walking more or getting up more frequently when sitting, they do become stiff.  People who don't either exercise or get up and move around are at risk for being very stiff and having some pain.  The same is true for my shoulders.  I still need to have the left shoulder replaced, and keeping them moving throughout the day prevents stiffness and some of the pain I still have in the one that hasn't been replaced.

The DVD that I have came with a Thera-Band which is a stretchy band that can be used for arm exercises and it was a great help in my physical therapy exercises after the knee surgeries.  The physical therapist would tie it onto a stationary object and then tie it loosely around my leg just above the knee, and I would gently pull my leg back for a count, then move it forward again and repeat.  It really helped with strengthening my thigh muscles as well as with the alignment of my leg and keeping it straight and getting the correct measurements when putting my leg straight out on the therapy table.

It's hard to exercise sometimes with very bad arthritis, but with an exercise video like this one, based on the Arthritis Foundation Exercise Program, it helps in the end to keep joints more flexible and more pain free, and doing these gently.  It's better than being full of sleep-inducing pain killers and much healthier!

Beware, though, that the booklet that comes with the video tells you that some exercises may not be right for people with joint replacements and with severe arthritis.  I wouldn't do any exercise program without my doctor's consent, but my doctor won't let me forget about it!",1330560000,20,1993,4.502777777777778
2624954,4,B000GZCATI,"I agree with the previous reviews.  It's an excellent overall workout for a an active person with OA and spinal stenosis.
When I skip it for a few days, I feel the difference.
(And yes, I have turned the music down and made substitutions from time to time).
I like the positive energy,the familiar illusion of community,the pleasant demeanor of the instructor and the ease with which one can adjust the level depending on how you're feeling on a given day.

Physically, I find it a good beginning to set the tone for the day and
emotionally, it's a friendly, gentle, experience.",1254700800,18,578,4.6568627450980395
2624955,4,B000GZCATI,"Very good exercise program.  The music is a little strange, but you can just turn it down and play a CD if it bugs you.",1253577600,6,119,3.76

8135464,5,B000GZCATI,"I like everything about this exercise DVD.  It has helped me with my knees, my hands, my back!  The exercises target every part of the body and you notice the difference in a couple of sessions!  I started doing these exercises at the senior center and liked them so much I decided to purchase the DVD, in order to do them at home on holidays and week-ends when the center is closed! Three times a week has improved my mobility and endurance!  I honestly recommend it to all those with arthritis, and those without who want to feel good all over!",1518480000,,546,4.376237623762377

They never became bored & found it to be very beneficial!! It works well for wheelchair bound participants too! After I retired, I decided to buy my own personal copy to use for myself.",1478044800,,329,4.5
8135467,5,B000GZCATI,My husband and I often do this DVD together.  It is excellent and exercises all parts of the body.  So glad we found it and recommend it to anyone with arthritis or needs a gentle type of exercise to start out.,1474675200,,210,4.097560975609756

8135470,5,B000GZCATI,Due to a flair-up of arthritis in my knee I have pretty much been a couch potato for too many months.  This exercise routine gently gets all my body parts moving & is also helping to chase away the blues.  Love it!,1465689600,,214,4.071428571428571
