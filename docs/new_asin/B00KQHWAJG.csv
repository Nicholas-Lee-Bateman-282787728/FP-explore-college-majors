8660819,5,B00KQHWAJG,"Addict of the Karajan from many years, but I've always felt that as soon as Bacchus shows up, things lose steam.  Not in this production, kept me standing in front of the screen to the end.
I will admit that I'm never certain how much the ""production"" influences me, since I'm in it for the music but the recent Hippolyte et Aricie from Glyndebourne at least proves that a bad production can ruin an opera for me.  This is not entirely neutral, as in I think the opera works rather well and the updating is harmless if unnecessary.
There are occasional balance problems and dropouts that would've been fixed in the studio, but all told the music making is very fine.  Isokoski has a spectacularly beautiful voice, not the ""where did that come from?"" event of Te Kanawa or Norman, but still gorgeous without accident or spread.  The composer I don't know but a real soprano and since that's how it's written, who's to argue?  Laura Claycomb is very fine (no one will ever erase the silvery thread of Rita Streich once heard) and she just keeps going, doesn't have to do it standing on her head but sings the role and finds the motive for each roulade in a most convincing way.
Skorokhodov is very, very good, probably the main victim of the theatre balance but still, he sings and the sound is bright so that he can approach it from above instead of pushing up (Schock bashers will now sign off, but....) I do miss Schock's mezza voce on  ""Zauberin"".
In all, I sat or stood in front of the screen for the whole thing and loved it.  This really is magnificent music, and I'll be damned if I get Grossmachtigen Prinzessin out of my mind.. ever.",1415750400,5,1641,4.468227424749164
8660820,5,B00KQHWAJG,"This opera technically consists of two parts, the prologue and the opera.  However, it is performed as one act, with the second part being an opera within the opera.  The subject of the prologue is that there are two performances that are to occur at a rich mans house in Vienna  one being an opera filled with depth and meaning that the Composer has poured his heart and soul into (stunningly portrayed by Kate Lindsey in a trouser role  she is *amazing*), and the second being a comedy troupe or more traditionally a burlesque troupe.  The problem is that the Major Domo announces that the dinner for the guests is running late, and that both performances must therefore occur at the same time and finish on-schedule.  Needless to say, this is greatly disturbing for the Composer who has created a work filled with meaning  and how Laura Claycombs Zerbinetta deals with it as the female leader of the burlesque troupe is something that really must be seen to be appreciated, as she appeals to the Composer with her feminine charms and gets him to agree to this sequence of events.  What happens next (which is particularly interesting, given Glyndebournes history as a home for evacuee children during wartime) is an airstrike sending the entire evening into chaos.

The second part, set here in the 1940s, works marvelously well in the wartime setting as Ariadne is struck by the loss of her love and cannot imagine continuing on with her life.  The role of Ariadne is stunningly portrayed by Soile Isokoski, who brings longing and mourning and frustration and all of the various facets of despair to the role.  And when she meets Bacchus (not a god in this production  rather more of an ordinary man or wartime soldier), her transformation is heartfelt as her life regains meaning and purpose again.  It is worth noting that Laura Claycombs Zerbinetta is not played here as a two-dimensional character  rather, her Zerbinetta deals with loss differently in a way that is neither better nor worse than Ariadnes  it is just different and movingly human.

I continue to be astonished as to how much Blu-ray adds to opera performances  while nothing compares to experiencing opera live in-person, the level of detail and the incredible sound quality is wonderful indeed.  It is worth noting how much the London Philharmonic brings Strauss sonic textures to life  and the fact that this is Vladimir Jurowskis final production as Music Director makes this sweeter still.  I was unfamiliar with this opera prior to receiving this recording, and I must say that I was glued to the performance all the way through.  This is captivating work, filled with meaning that speaks to some of the underlying basics of human existence.  I look forward to eventually seeing this opera in person, but I have no doubt that I will be re-watching this disc on more than one occasion.  Very highly recommended!",1409529600,7,2890,4.841140529531568
8660821,4,B00KQHWAJG,"A beautiful cast is assembled to carry out the Richard Strauss score. The production suffered from unnecessary characters and supernumeraries on the stage, sometimes cluttering it with hyperactivity. I did not care for the return of Componist after the Prologue. I felt his return in the opera made the character appear weaker. This Rachel Maddow lookalike was believable and delivered a beautiful character, but for Lindsey's constantly apologetic shoulder position. Laura Claycomb was perky and at times appropriately melancholy. If we are going to stage the work in 1940, might we have covers for the large windows in the home that is under constant threat from the blitz? The use of this special effect was visually effective, however it robbed the Componist of his last statements in the Prologue. Also the stage business concerning Zerbinetta and her ease with men was far too 21st century to fit in with an audience of 1940, especially the bits with the straightjacket, the pianist, and with Harlekin.  Overall, staging was gratuitous . I did like that Thoma was sensitive to the music, having almost every orchestral special effect having its own choreography. Having the pianist on stage was nothing less than brilliant! If she can take all her ideas and perhaps do 80 percent, I think we will achieve perfection! If you are looking for the ideal Ariadne, this is not it. But to compare productions, by all means.",1407542400,4,1422,5.02542372881356
8660822,5,B00KQHWAJG,"The purpose or indeed the true worth of Ariadne auf Naxos isn't always immediately identifiable.  Like Der Rosenkavalier, Arabella and Capriccio, the opera is partly a homage to opera and older forms of music and in how they clash with a more modern sensibility, and partly it's an experiment with style and form.  Musically and poetically it's clearly a work of exquisite beauty and sophistication, but isn't it really just a frivolous exercise that's overly contrived and ultimately inconsequential?  Ariadne auf Naxos, of course, is only silly and inconsequential if it's allowed to be and only if it's played either too straight or its seemingly one-note joke is overplayed for laughs.  It's extremely rare that a director is able to get to the heart and true genius of the work in the way that Katharina Thoma does for the 2013 Glyndebourne production.

The coming together of high art and low entertainment to reach out and say something meaningful to an audience is the ""message"" of Ariadne auf Naxos.  Zerbinetta's deflating of the lofty expressions of Ariadne's self-indulgent grief (What she really needs is a new man!"") reflects a belief that life's difficult questions may indeed be found in life's simple pleasures.  Does the opera however really need so much artifice to deliver such a simple sentiment?  Well, Ariadne auf Naxos is about the transformative power of love, the creation and realisation of one's dreams and illusions, the creation of ""little gods"", and in a way that's what opera does too.  It's not life, it's an artificial construct, but it's one that nonetheless contains essential truths, real emotions and feelings and stagecraft and illusion is very much a part of the package.

The WWII period setting for this Ariadne auf Naxos has proven to be controversial in some parts - which I find hard to believe.  In reality it's fully supportive of the themes of the work and its opera within an opera conceit by cleverly placing its country estate setting within the country estate setting of Glyndebourne.  More than just being a clever self-referential idea however, Katharina Thoma makes the essential conflict within the opera work by relating it back to an issue that plagued Strauss and his librettist Hugh von Hofmannstahl through most of their working lives - the question of the split between the world of the artist and reality.  His career spanning two world wars, the question of whether the artist has any responsibility for what goes on in the wider world or whether they should remain above politics and concerned only with essential universal questions of human nature was a particularly thorny question for Strauss as a German composer.

It's not difficult to see Strauss' personal dilemma in the character of the Composer and his horror of the desecration of his glorious work of art - ""Why drag me from my world into this?"", he asks as fighter planes fly over the stately home, bombs explode and masonry falls from the ceiling onto the stage.  The actual performance of the combined operas takes place subsequently in the same stately home that has now been converted into a field hospital for the wounded.  Looking like a WWII entertainment company, Zerbinetta's chirpy optimism however represents the spirit and tenacity of the ordinary citizen to pull through, no matter how bleak the situation, although she herself exhibits signs of PTSD-induced delirium.  Bacchus arrives as a battle-weary fighter pilot ready to assist Ariadne through to the promise of the new post-war world.  This is simply marvellous characterisation and presentation.  The power of art, theatre, music and - very specifically - music and opera to transform and illuminate reality is exactly what Ariadne auf Naxos sets out to demonstrate.  There's nothing frivolous about it.

And if the stagecraft helps brings these elements out, the performances are no less critical to getting the message across.  Soile Isokoski is a soaring Ariadne, Sergey Skorokhodov a suitably heldentenor Bacchus, Kate Lindsey an intense Composer, singing marvellously and even making her presence felt in the second part, Laura Claycomb a sparkling Zerbinetta.  Vladimir Jurowski draws out the delicate beauty of the opera's reduced ensemble instrumentation, tying its deceptively simple melodies accurately to the tone and the intent of the production.  The region-free Blu-ray presents the production well on a BD50 disc, with extra features that look at the design and concept.  Jurowski is particularly impressed at how insightfully the production draws out all the meaning of a difficult work.  Subtitles are in English, French, German and Korean.",1403740800,13,4656,5.158244680851064
