8600976,5,B00E4ME0KQ,Was looking for bluray for all the seasons. This works. I will continue to buy glee products for the rest of my life just to support it. This showed changed my life literally. I was on the brink of suicide and had nothing to look forward to with life. I was just like Kurt afraid of coming out but i kept watching the show every single week and it changed my perspective on life. You can say what you want but I will forever cherish this show. It's not just another show .....if you haven't watched it yet......I highly recommend buying this it's a great deal!!!,1427932800,2,562,4.311320754716981
8600977,2,B00E4ME0KQ,"I've seen over 10 episodes of Glee, from various seasons.
On the plus side:
- Usually the vocals are very solid, with good tone and skill delivered by talented vocalists.
- The production numbers try very hard to bring life or relevance to the songs, most of which all seem to be covers.
On the negative side:
- The story lines can by strangely annoying.  Such as locking the two gay characters in an elevator that couldn't actually have been built, forcing them to make out or fall in love, why?  Don't ask, I won't tell!  The show seems to be littered with bizarre situations that don't click in the real world.  Maybe this Glee exists on some other universe and I just missed that plot development in some season 1 episode.
- The characters are often non-relateable.  Your mind will wonder if the creators actually think humans really act this way, or are they supposed to be symbolic representations of archetype characters, or perhaps exaggerated joke-characters for drama or humor?  You got me Glee!
- The mean characters can be excessively mean in their rhetoric.  If real administrators said half the things they say in Glee in the real world, they would be fired.  If meant to be serious, the mean rhetoric is overly nasty, but I am guessing it's meant to be funny, although it rarely works, so more often it just ends of being distasteful or at minimum, not entertaining.
- The messages are often liberal to hyper sappy degrees.  At the same time these lessons are done with such extreme reverence that it can easily turn into the clich of how fascinating it is to watch a train wreck.  Well, fascinating or irritating.  Glee easily tilts its entertainment value into a message/annoyance tolerance test.
- The musical numbers themselves are all over the place.  While they are expensively produced and technically accomplished, they are rarely great.  Often they are overly sentimental when sentiment is the emotion called for, including cloying tearful reaction shots.  Or they are too overtly diverse, where everyone from the cripple to the effeminate, to every possible ethnic diversity is afforded a piece of the musical pie (a vocal moment).

I could go on and on, and I'm certain a whole book could be written about the inappropriate or misguided messages, the extreme camp element (which in this case is not always a good thing), and the difference between a musical number that entertains instead of just trying too damn hard to please.  But I hope that book is never written.  The show doesn't deserve the amount of time that would take.
