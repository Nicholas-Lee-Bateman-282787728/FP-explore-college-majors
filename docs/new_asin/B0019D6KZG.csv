8273624,3,B0019D6KZG,"Excellent docu-drama, true to the real life story (with many actual participants in 'walk on' roles).  Covers crash of United Airlines Flight 232 under the command of Captain Al Haynes at Sioux City airport in 1989 after complete hydraulic failure from exploding centre engine on DC10.  Remarkable airmanship from aircraft pilots/engineer and cabin crew, together with brilliant rescue by emergency services, resulting from forward planning by fire chief Jim Hathaway and county emergency management chief, Gary Brown.  The fortunate availability of manpower from the local Air National Guard squadron and the superb performance of city hospitals, resulted in 184 survivors from total souls on board of 296, in what was worst US air disaster prior to 9/11.",1237766400,4,756,5.444444444444445
