8743815,5,B01943ZNM8,"Thank you for the narrators on the movie our LORD JESUS, showing he perform the miracles when he came to give us salvation.  JESUS IS THE SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY AND TOMORROW.  The movie teaches that above all the miracles that OUR LORD JESUS DID was about FAITH.

WHAT IS FAITH :  the bible said  HEBREWS 11;1
Now faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see.

God Bless You

8743817,2,B01943ZNM8,It was very disappointing. It would have been better if it would not have been narrated. I thought that it was going to be the actual actors speaking but the narrator was telling the story. I guess after watching Jesus of Nazareth I thought this one would be good that it just took the miracles and singled them out but I was wrong. This is just my opinion. Watch it for yourself you might like this.,1507075200,,400,4.276315789473684
