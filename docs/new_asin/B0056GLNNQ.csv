4588447,5,B0056GLNNQ,"I am an avid Share Bear fan so I had to get this DVD. I got a copy before they were available in the U.S.A when a friend in Australia
sent me one. Here we get to see The Care Power Team in action at the beginning of the movie. I love the way True Heart looks in this
movie. She must age backwards, she just gets cuter and cuter with every movie I've seen her in.

The plot in this movie starts out great but does get a little lame in the end. For Grumpy fans I thought it made him look a bit cowardly. For those who are GrumpyXShare fans it is also a bit disappointing. For some reason Princess Starglo makes me think of the
Valley Girl fad of a few years ago.

Still it is a good movie. I give it five stars because this could be the last incarnation of the current Bears. I love the Aical style.
When the new series debuts I hope much of the Aical style survives.",1315785600,4,865,3.909090909090909

8459588,5,B0056GLNNQ,My daughter absolutely loves this movie! We downloaded to her ipad and it keeps her entertained in the car.,1434412800,,107,4.684210526315789

8459591,5,B0056GLNNQ,"I love this. To be honest, I thought this was part of the ""Care a lot"" series when I ordered it... but it's not. It's actually different actors entirely. But it's still adorable & my 2.5 year old loves watching this cartoon.",1397433600,,224,4.357142857142857
8459592,5,B0056GLNNQ,My granddaughter loves the care bears and so I got her the cake topper and the movie and the actual bear and my daughter also go her a care bear that talks. She really didn't want any other gifts except the care bears. She will sit and watch the movie over and over. It is very entertaining. She has learned a lot by listening to the songs and singing them. Great gift for a 2 year old.,1381795200,,386,4.025974025974026
8459593,2,B0056GLNNQ,Interesting. Don't care for this style animation. And the super-powers the bears get from their belly badges is very odd. My least favorite installment of the series so far.,1380931200,,173,5.0
8459594,5,B0056GLNNQ,"My kids love the ""new"" CareBears so this is for them.  I don't know how well it would play to kids who are not already hooked but if you have a CareBear lover, be sure to add this to your collection.",1356739200,,199,3.8536585365853657
8459595,5,B0056GLNNQ,"I didn't think it was possible but this movie has replaced Care Bears: The big wish as the most frequently requested movie by our girls.  So much so that they have watched in twice in one day on more than one occasion.  Sneaky kids convince each parent to let them watch it without the other realizing they had already watched it once.  The movie is a newer CGI style cartoon and has great songs and messages for young kids.  I do recommend this for young kids - with the exception that if they are carebear fans already they will likely want to watch it over and over until you have it memorized.

Also worth noting that Amazon has a deal right now that allows you to watch instantly on demand if you purchase the DVD.",1347235200,,719,4.296296296296297
