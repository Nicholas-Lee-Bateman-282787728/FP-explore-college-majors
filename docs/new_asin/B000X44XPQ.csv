2998285,4,B000X44XPQ,I feel like I get a good workout in a few minutes by doing the circuit training. I do these in the morning before getting ready for work. I really feel that I'm getting a good workout in less than 15 min vs my routine workout 30-50min. Great for those days you just don't have enough time to workout.,1212192000,,300,4.101694915254237
2998286,5,B000X44XPQ,"I bought this product after seeing the latest BIGGEST LOSER winner, Ally!  WOW - I couldn't believe her transformation.  This product lives up to its claims.  You get a ""personal trainer"" in your own home.  Jillian will push you and you will get results.  I would recommend this to anyone - regardless of fitness level!",1211328000,2,319,4.7272727272727275
2998287,5,B000X44XPQ,"These videos are like having your own personal trainer! I love her simple approach. No dance moves to learn, just simple excersises put together in a way to keep your heartrate up! She is totally down to earth and an awesome motivation!",1210896000,,236,4.642857142857143
2998288,4,B000X44XPQ,"This 3 pack DVD set is great for beginners.  It is easy to follow, but yet challenging enough to get a good workout.  Also there is three different DVD's to choose from when you want to workout.  I would definately recommend it.",1209340800,2,228,4.380952380952381
2998289,5,B000X44XPQ,These DVDs were well represented and exactly what I was looking for.  The price was a great value.  I will definitely by Jillian Michaels Exercise DVDs again.,1208649600,,158,4.814814814814815
2998290,4,B000X44XPQ,"This set of workout videos are great for beginners because the movements are not over the top, there isn't a bunch of jumping and crazy moves and you most definitely sweat, even if you are in pretty good shape. My only complaint is that the tapes are a little long. The backside is 54 minutes and unless you are motivated, you can get tired and give up too quickly. The cardio kickboxing is about 25 minutes and just the right length. Frontside is good at 42 minutes but once I learned the routines and didn't have to wait for instruction between moves, I can do the circuits in about 30 minutes. I would recommend it for those who are serious and more than casual exercisers.",1206835200,20,676,4.416
2998291,5,B000X44XPQ,"This is a great workout for a beginner.  She's precise, but it keeps moving.  I was able to keep up, and I love how with each additional set she adds an advancement for as you become fitter.  I am very pleased with this purchase",1202169600,17,228,4.136363636363637

8226874,4,B000X44XPQ,"Well, mine came with an alternate to the 'kick boxing' dvd, which is why I'm only giving it 4 stars. Mine had 'yoga meltdown' instead. I'd bought the set for 'Frontside' and 'Backside' so I'm not unhappy. I'm probably equally bad at 'yoga meltdown' as I'd be at 'kickboxing"". However, I do have other yoga dvds and would have liked the opportunity to try kick boxing. I really like the other two dvds so I'm happy.",1441756800,,414,4.4605263157894735
8226875,5,B000X44XPQ,I literally am not in shape enough to complete these program.  I tried the kickboxing parts and couldn't even make it.,1388793600,,118,4.619047619047619
8226876,2,B000X44XPQ,"I thought this would work up to the more difficult exercises, and for some this would be excellent, but for me it was just too hard.",1376956800,,132,4.115384615384615
8226877,5,B000X44XPQ,I really love this work out and don't think for a min that Jillian Michaels is going to be easy on you because what the point of a work out if she don't kick your butt. ;0),1271116800,,172,3.675675675675676
8226878,4,B000X44XPQ,"I rated this 4 out of 5 stars only because once I ran through the video with Jillian's verbal instruction I wish I could now just skip the verbal and go through the circuits without all that. There's a lot of (necessary for the beginner) talking which makes these circuits go slow. I just hit the FF button on my remote now - next circuit! Jillian is great! The cardio is great too, gets your heart pumping. The moves are not difficult and can be modified if needed. I definitely recommend this item!",1232150400,3,500,4.387096774193548
8226879,4,B000X44XPQ,"I would consider myself an intermediate level.  There are three tapes in this set.  Two are good; the third I consider unsafe.  These tapes (Frontside/Backside) are for good for beginners and intermediates.  I have never watched biggest loser so can't say I'm a Jillian fan.  She has Loser contestants perform the workouts while she provides guidance.  She does a nice job of emphasizing form and suggesting strategies for greater difficulty in each workout.  She uses a circuit method:  cardio, 2-3 exercises, then repeat.  Each circuit is repeated three times.  I usually go a bit slower to check my form but find that it works well as I don't have to wait to find out what next exercise is and can just go through the routine.  You need some equipment for these tapes.  I've listed them below.

Frontside:  Equipment:  mat, chair, hand weights (whatever is good for you; beginners definitely want something light 3 or 5 pound to work up to).

Backside:  Equipment:  same as above, also step box--doesn't have to be fancy, resistance band.

Cardio Kickbox:  I think this tape may have been one of her first.  She's very giggly and nervous.  What bothered me the most is she goes through the routine very quickly and doesn't focus on form.  I made it through the warm-up and barely into the actual routine, when I turned the dvd off.  Unlike the other two tapes, there's very little guidance and a rapid fire pace.  When I saw ""visions of injuries"" in my near future,  I knew this tape was not for me.  I have never done kick box but have followed many cardio tapes including Kathy Smith, The Firm, Gilad.  I have learned the hard way (listen to your body).  If you find yourself feeling off balance or flailing, move on to something else.

Overall, it's worth the price ($15); even with one tape being tossed.",1231027200,2,1811,4.67515923566879
8226880,5,B000X44XPQ,She has a great style.  I get a great workout.  I look forward to more dvd's by Jillian.,1220313600,,88,3.8333333333333335
8226881,5,B000X44XPQ,"Good starting point. I've taken a cardio kickboxing class and this dvd used some very basic moves repeatedly to get your heart going. Nothing too complicated.  the other dvd worked in circuits which is nice to change things up a bit.  It moves at a pace very good for beginners.  Makes you sweat and makes you sore, which means it's working. I would suggest it for someone looking to get started.",1217376000,3,396,4.549295774647887
8226882,1,B000X44XPQ,Very disappointed with this dvd set. The first dvd had no video and would not load on my computer. The other 2 dvds have a great deal of talking and instruction which is annoying to have to watch every time you want to work out.,1215302400,2,228,4.088888888888889
8226883,5,B000X44XPQ,"While I originally bought this 3 pack DVD work-out for the Cardio Kickbox, I have found that I actually like the for Beginners Frontside and Backside DVD's even more. The circuits are kept nice and short and to the point. Each circuit takes only a few minutes to complete, but still pack a punch and have you feeling the burn in a way that you know it's working. I couldn't have been happier with this purchase. Thanks Jillian!!!",1212883200,5,429,4.512820512820513
