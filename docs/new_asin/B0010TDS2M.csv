8238506,2,B0010TDS2M,"I give this movie two stars, and it's a shame because I really wanted to like this movie. The overall story line was very compelling. You were examining the different facets of brotherhood - familial, fraternal, and friendship. The movie highlighted how fraternal bonds and brotherhood are strengthened between people who hardly knew each other before becoming members of the same Greek organization. It also highlighted sibling rivalry at its extreme. However, here is where the film lost me. It's obvious this was a low budget film. All the money was probably spent on getting Sinbad and Vanessa Bell Calloway on board. Therefore, with a low budget film you get poor production quality (i.e. the unenthusiastic party scenes). Also, the acting was bad, but the writing was worse. The females were made to look like nothing more than boy-crazed Jezebels, and there were parts of the story that were left untouched leaving questions of ""Why was it even in the movie?"" Lastly, the movie isn't about stepping at all. This is probably the aspect that upsets me most. If you're going to call a movie ""Stompin'"", then you should take the time to make the scenes were stepping is involved look and sound phenomenal. As a member of a Black Greek Lettered Organization and someone who has stepped in numerous shows, what was shown in this movie as stepping was a piss-poor attempt at depicting the art. The sound was off, the energy wasn't there, and by the time you get to the step show in the film you're completely exhausted and dismayed with what is being represented on your screen. Basically, the film would've been better off being titled ""Brotherhood"" or something of the sort instead of ""Stompin'"". In the end I give the movie two stars for the compelling story. It's just sad that it had absolutely nothing else there to support it.",1331596800,3,1833,4.822222222222222
8238507,3,B0010TDS2M,"I just saw this film and had low expectations, as I do about most films regarding black Greek life.  However, it wasn't wholly disappointing.

First, the story itself was strong.  It's not a ""Greek"" movie so much as it is a movie about the multiple facets of brotherhood:  kin, friendship, and fraternalism.  I must say that I appreciated the the film wasn't about pledging or hazing.

Another strong point is that it highlights West Coast black Greek life.  Having been made in the East and noticing that the South gets the most ""shine"" it was nice to see the filmmaker's take of what brotherhood is like in California.  Bonus points (in the case of the Alphas, at least) using actual members as parts of the step teams.  One in particular was recognizable as a former national board member.

I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the tertiary story of the struggle for Mu Chi Sorority (ostensibly a multicultural sorority) to gain recognition and acceptance by the Greek council on campus.

While the story is very strong and the ideas transmitted are moving, the writing itself doesn't take you all the way there.  In moments of weak dialogue, the brothers in the film, played by Shedrack Anderson III and Chris Facey give extraordinarily nuanced performances.

(In fact, the film probably could have been saved if the scenes between the brothers were improvised.  Shedrack in particular nails the role of the unloved brother living in his big brother's shadow.)

And I'm ever surprised to say that Sinbad played the role of stern, cynical father very well.  It's clear which son he prefers and which he wants to ""man up.""  Vanessa Bell Calloway also does a good job as the long-suffering wife and mother who tried to dote on each son equally.

Unfortunately, I can't give the film any more credit.  As I said, the story is strong, but the writing leaves a lot to be desired.  The dialogue among the students isn't always believable, and the female characters in the story serve as nothing more than post modern Jezebels and women in peril.

The acting, aside from the performances I mentioned (as well as the usually funny Schrunchoo), wasn't great.  Sure, there was drama but there wasn't much nuance.

Sadly, the production values weren't anywhere near other films about college life such as Stomp the Yard or Drumline.  Which is a shame, really -- Stompin' had a far superior storyline than either of those films.

Buy the film because the story needs to be told and heard.  But keep an open mind about it.",1302220800,4,2509,4.75
8238508,1,B0010TDS2M,"I wish I didn't read the review of the person who wrote ""This was a good DVD"". This DVD was not worh the asking price. If you can get it used for less than $5 it would be an okay buy. The storyline was good. You had two brothers, one was a star athletic and the other was doing his own thing; battling for their father's attention and the same girl. But the acting, directing and producing is so bad you over look the storyline. The bottomline is the movie has a five star price with a one star budget. If you have seen Show Stoppers and thought it was wack, this movie is worse.",1208304000,2,579,4.043478260869565
8238509,4,B0010TDS2M,This is a good movie.  Sinbad is back and so is Vannessa Belle.  I highly recommend you see this movie!,1205280000,,103,4.1
