8654236,1,B00JWS9H8M,"The movie shifts between Bongo (Greg Kasey)  as an adult psycho killer and Bongo as a scared child watching Jakko the Clown (Newt Wallen) on TV and being berated by his mother (Allison Goldfire).  The adult scene is a retelling of his story at the Gelenora State Asylum. The clown isn't much of a killer and he isn't that scary. His make-up is bad and he has Donald Trump hair and appropriately chases a large breasted woman with an Eastern European accent. However, other than the insanity, the similarities end there.

Not worth a free watch unless the tattoos and piercings of Allison Goldfire is must see for you. The acting, sound, and script was all bad.

Don't be fooled by the DVD cover artwork as that is NOT the clown you will see nor a butcher knife either (I have attached a photo of what the SO CALLED KILLER CLOWN looks like and his weapon, looks like a silver ninja knife with a VERY ROUNDED POINT! The pic of the knife provided is not the actual knife used in the movie just similar as in looks). The gore and blood factor in this movie are almost NON EXISTENT! Only good thing in this movie are 2 very good looking ladies (20 year old tatted mom and lady with accent). The acting is HORRIBLE & annoying, movie looks like it was shot in one day, lousy directing, special FX are a joke, the audio is way too loud, editing is lousy and the so called asylum is just the inside of someone's house, absolutely no budget was put into the making of this film . I have not been this disappointed with an independent film in years, it was very painful to actually sit and watch this garbage as that is where this DVD went. I usually give my unwanted DVDs to friends or family but I could not and would not subject anybody to sit through this miserable crap. There is NOTHING redeeming in this film and feel I was ripped off with just the shipping alone. This movie will not even make it in a Wal Mart dump bin as a dump bin is too good for this so called horror flick. Don't waste your money or time on Bongo Killer Clown. 2 Bloody Thumbs Down, WAY DOWN!",1417651200,4,1445,4.109540636042403
8654238,5,B00JWS9H8M,The BAD TEEN MOMMY goes topless and is mean to junior! He turns PSYCHO case! Not sure if it was meant to be funny but the guy who plays the clown is a funny whacko and weird looking! it was actually a pretty engaging story. the ending is a shocker! Was worth it just to see the clown chase  teens while cursing MF'er every minute as he stomps on his mommys head and kicks it for a field goal!,1417392000,,392,3.962025316455696
