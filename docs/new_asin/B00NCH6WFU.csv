8677434,5,B00NCH6WFU,"Great set for beginners and advanced students. Some exercises are very simple and some will take time to master, like figure 8 with a knife. Most exercises you can practice on your-own, but for some you'll need a partner as in any other martial arts. Hopefully, one day I can join the seminar in person and have an opportunity to practice with different partners and see Russia!",1429660800,,378,4.656716417910448
8677435,5,B00NCH6WFU,"What I like the most about this set is that it has 2 parts: self-development (working with breathing, state of mind, combat trance) and actual fighting techniques. Easy to follow, great explanations, simple to understand. This set has everything from basic combat movements to elements of combat with multiple opponents. This set is about 6.5 hours and  it covers a lot of vital subjects of street fighting. Great for beginners and for advance martial artists!",1428796800,,460,5.133333333333334

However the seminar is over after so many hours. This can be viewed over and over so you do not miss a thing!  ~ by Carles Vasquez",1426464000,,552,9.823529411764707
