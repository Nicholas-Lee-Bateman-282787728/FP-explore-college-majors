This is a Thai crime families drama that concentrates on a young gangster moving though the ranks.

Heard that one before?

This is different, I assure you. In a gritty, 1970's look, this film reveals a tremendously violent insider-view of Thai Mafia families and how they seem to operate amid police corruption and a failed state.

Somehow managing to come off as dreamlike and untouched by the outside world, in an almost bizarre purity of evil and innocence, this film portrays men and women trapped in the lives they have chosen, some reluctantly, and some joyously.

The bad guys are really, really BAD; the ""good"" guys are truly bad, also, but conflicted, and longing for a new beginning elsewhere, which always makes for story, in a spaghetti-westernish way.

There is a serious plot to this almost ingenuous film: tradition, honor, corruption, betrayal, lust, blood and non-stop action.

Buy it! Buy it! :)
