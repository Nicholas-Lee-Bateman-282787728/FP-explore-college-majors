8712902,5,B00WDQO3WU,I had the privilege of meeting three of the people in this video this past week. This video answered a lot of questions I did not have time to ask.,1530921600,,147,3.933333333333333
8712903,5,B00WDQO3WU,"Excellent documentary. They really explain about what the mormon theology (very different from Christianity) and their works based rituals. The most beautiful part the documentary is towards the end where the former mormons explain how they finally heard and accepted the true gospel found in the Bible and what to do if a Mormon missionary comes to your home (if you are a Christian, share the gospel!!)",1483228800,,404,5.044776119402985
8712904,2,B00WDQO3WU,"I can't give this one star. The historical account is pretty accurate. There are some things which I didn't know (as I was told that the ""seer stones"" WERE the ummim and thummem and not glasses), but that could easily be just another bit of misinformation I was given growing up. They were also very nice in not bringing up that Jesus and Elohim live on a planet that revolves around the star Kolob! That makes them seem even more far out, so I feel this was done tastefully.

The interviews, though... I was enraged. My significant other could not finish the documentary with me -- I had to watch it on my own time. Why was I upset? Documentaries (good ones) are not about cherry picking interviewees.

I've known many Christian Ex-Mormons. Most do not fell like these people do. The interview close to the end with the son's mother coming to Christ almost sounds scripted and is so far removed from true Mormon belief that I had to stop for a moment and question whether she was just an actress being paid.

Mormons believe in The Bible and they don't hold the Book of Mormon in higher esteem. Mormons ""house"" God in the same way that the Hebrews did in the Holy of Holies! They believe in Christ and God as different people based on other scripture that makes it sound like they are... From The Bible no less! Not the Book of Mormon! Matthew 3:17 says a voice came from heaven saying ""This is my son of whom I am well pleased"". These people were cherry picked for a very specific story. A story that is not very fair to today's Mormons (who are not charlatans, murderers, and polygamists) or even to those that have left that faith.

I am a Christian. I believe Mormons are Christians by definition. I do not believe they are the one, true church. I believe that through striving to be Christ-like and accepting Him into your heart, you will find eternal salvation and happiness. I know it's true because I'm happier now than I've been in my whole life.

The basics that I'm trying to say about this documentary, is that the history is good, but the opinions are cherry picked and needlessly critical of the Mormon religion. I, and most Ex-Mormon Christians that I've met, have been nothing like the folks interviewed in this documentary.",1475539200,,2241,4.523456790123457
8712905,5,B00WDQO3WU,"This is a wonderful documentary revealing the astounding truth behind Mormonism from ex Mormons who experienced first hand all that the religion entails. This presentation struck me as a work of love to try to help the world to understand the differences between the Mormon faith and what the Bible teaches. It exposes the reality of the Mormon religion of trying to work your way into eternal life without ever knowing for sure if you have done enough as opposed to the Biblical way of God freely giving us eternal life through His love and grace, unmerited favor, by a person's faith in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior. Anyone who is in the Mormon faith, or is considering joining or who is not sure how to know for sure you can have your sins forgiven and live a life of peace of mind and soul in this world and forever should invest the  1 1/2 hours in viewing this. I just watched it streamed through Amazon Prime and it is available on DVD.",1461974400,4,946,4.436781609195402
8712906,1,B00WDQO3WU,"I tried watching this on my amazon prime as i was interested to find out, well basically what the title of the ""documentary"" is.  In another words i wanted to find out more about mormons and their beliefs. This really is not a film about that. As far as i can tell its mostly just interviews with ex mormons who are now of a different christian denomination saying why they don't think mormons are christians. That probably should be the title, ""Why we don't think Mormons are christians like us.""  Anyway, its an ax piece on mormanism intended for a christian audience that is not mormon. So if that interests you then watch it. I gave it one star as the name is misleading and i am not really a fan when people attack other peoples beliefs pretending to be trying to be informative.",1461542400,2,784,4.4375
8712907,5,B00WDQO3WU,"Excellent documentary! This film interviews several former-Mormons and provides an objective history of the founders and events leading to the creation of this religion.  The history will be different from what Mormons learn and teach within their church, but this film backs up their facts with objective historical accounts (from the context of events from American history, from municipal criminal records, from eye witness testimonies of non-Mormons who saw the original Book of Mormon plates, etc.).  The interviewees are former Mormons who had Mormon families, held leadership positions in their church ward, worked in a Mormon temple, were Mormon missionaries, etc., so they have intimate knowledge of the religion and culture, as well as inside perspectives.

** Spoiler Alert ** Most, if not all, of the interviewees have since come to faith as (Protestant) Christians, so there is a Christian ""bias,"" if you want to call it that.  But these interviewees were not bitter or vengeful or malicious.  If anything, it tore them apart to even consider leaving the religion.  But ultimately, they found liberation and new life in discovering what the Bible had to say for itself.",1456185600,5,1182,5.26063829787234
8712908,1,B00WDQO3WU,"Biased anti Mormon documentary. If you want to learn something about Mormons, you might want to get it from the horses mouth.",1455235200,3,125,4.7272727272727275
