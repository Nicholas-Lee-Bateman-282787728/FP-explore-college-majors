8632615,3,B00HG37J30,I've taken yoga at the gym but I'm not super into it.  Not sure why I thought it would be a good idea to start up while 7 months pregnant.  I think this would be a great video if you like yoga and/or start early pregnancy.  I was just too big and uncomfortable to move like that.,1424908800,,279,3.8596491228070176
8632616,5,B00HG37J30,"Blooma is a local service/business in my metro area, so I am a bit biased. But I am also an obstetrics provider and recommend the DVD or download to all of my prenatal patients. It helps women stay flexible, with less pain and greater mobility throughout pregnancy. The movements are doable, even for a the yoga naive. I don't have a dissatisfied Blooma patient yet!",1418169600,,366,4.6461538461538465
8632617,5,B00HG37J30,"Love it! She does say axehale alot and that can be annoying but other than that ,it is an amazing workout and calming experience, ive never done yoga before and found this a little challenging, but I also started it at 6 months pregnant with just chasing the toddler as exercise! I wish there were different routines to choose from, doing the same routine 3 times a week can get old but it also deeply relaxes me and makes me feel confident in preparing for my natural birth, im definitely considering purchasing their other video!",1408233600,,531,4.6
8632618,5,B00HG37J30,"I'm lucky enough that I got to attend Blooma classes in person during my pregnancy as well as this DVD. I went to class 1-2x per week & did this the other days. This made my labor & delivery experience so much better. I was stronger & more able to labor in many positions because of this. She's very positive & sweet. The workout it challenging - especially as you get to the end of your pregnancy, I made many modifications.

Before pregnancy I was running 2x/week & yoga sculpt 2x/week.",1404777600,,488,4.362637362637362
8632619,4,B00HG37J30,"I own half a dozen prenatal videos and this is probably my favorite video. I have practiced yoga before and know most of the basic positions. I think a beginner can easily follow this video. I didn't purchase until my second or third trimester. It was pretty challenging for me because I was so tired and my pregnancy wasn't easy. Now that I have had my baby, I have been using this video to get back in shape. I would recommend this video to other pregnant mommas.",1400025600,,465,4.35632183908046
8632620,1,B00HG37J30,"I sent this video back because I could not handle the sound if the lady's voice, mostly how she said the word ""exhale"" all the time. She says ""axe-hale"". It drove me crazy.

Also, if you have been doing yoga for any amount if time, even a month, this video is NOT challenging enough! It's great for relaxing. I am 28weeks pregnant and could barely get my heart rate up at all during this video. Before now I have done non prenatal yoga just once a week and rode a stationary bike for 45 min-1hr one other day per week.  I have decent balance and am considered to have an athletic build, but still. This is definitely a beginner level video. Not bad! But just know that before you purchase.",1397174400,,689,4.292307692307692
8632621,5,B00HG37J30,This is a vigorous dvd. I think if you are a beginner it may be overwhelming but if you stick with it and do what would can it will be worth it. The instructor lets you know which exercises are good for labor and why as well. If you focused on these I feel you would have some extra tools as you moved through the labor process.,1392076800,,328,3.91044776119403
8632622,5,B00HG37J30,"This DVD along with the AM/PM Prenatal DVD by Sarah has been my savior during this pregnancy.  There is nothing else that has helped me emotionally, physically and energetically prepare and enjoy our first pregnancy more than the time on my mat with Sarah.  (besides being blessed enough to live close to practice at the Blooma studios in MN).  You will be 100% grateful that you discovered this gem.",1391385600,,400,4.768115942028985
