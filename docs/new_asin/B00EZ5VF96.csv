5958196,5,B00EZ5VF96,I came across this by chance and it's a fun premise. Who hasn't found themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time? Easy to relate to with comedy and thrills.,1407801600,,161,4.225806451612903
5958197,5,B00EZ5VF96,"One has to understand British humor to really enjoy this witty and cleverly done program. For those don't usually watch British productions, this is a good one to start with.",1407456000,,174,4.833333333333333
5958198,5,B00EZ5VF96,"The show its ridiculous and gets more fun with every episode.  Fun!  I am expecting a US studio to try and make it there own.  But this is an original idea, with an original story in each episode.  The ending is great, the characters are engaging.  Even the bad guys are engaging.

If you don't watch it on Prime Hulu + it is worth the buy.",1393459200,6,340,4.075757575757576

5958207,5,B00EZ5VF96,This starts a tad slow in the first episode then rapidly builds to a boil which is maintained over the all-too-brief single season where these two just get in deeper and deeper to the point where you can't see any way out. Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys any forms of British comedy.,1424736000,4,292,4.528301886792453
5958208,5,B00EZ5VF96,"I love the show Gavin and Stacy and when I saw that ""Smithy and Deano"" were collaborating in a new show I had to watch.  The premise is interesting and show is hilarious!!  I can't wait for the third season.  I hope his duties as the new host of The Late Late Show doesn't hinder production!",1424649600,2,291,4.160714285714286
5958209,5,B00EZ5VF96,"Fabulous! If you liked the British series Spy, you'll love this. The fantastic situations these find themselves in are absurd and so well-played by these two actors as people who want to do the right thing when they are forced into action but so clearly out of their element. Give it a try on Hulu first.",1420502400,,304,4.446428571428571

This show is one of the funniest BBC America shows I have seen in a while. It's a shame that it only has a limited of episodes per season but it's very funny and worth the watch. Especially, Season 2, which is on Hulu Plus now...",1420156800,,252,4.04

5958216,5,B00EZ5VF96,"My middle school daughter LOVES Horrible Histories and Doctor Who, so having two of the actors from these shows, with British humor, and wacky, zany escapades was right up her alley. I enjoyed it for the unbelievable situations the two got themselves into inadvertantly as they tracked down the owner of the cell phone and then tried to do the right thing. There's some language I flinched about (because middle schooler sitting right there beside me) and the scene in one episode where they are at the house party of a Russian Mob boss I kind of wanted to cover my daughter's eyes, but otherwise this is great fun!",1410739200,2,615,4.651376146788991

5958218,5,B00EZ5VF96,Love this show! It's very funny and the two leads -- who also created and write the show -- are tremendous. Their back 'n forth dialogue and relationship make this one of the best buddy comedies in years.,1409788800,,204,4.394736842105263

8610671,5,B00EZ5VF96,"While there are certainly adolescent elements to Wrong Mans humor, the series is truly brilliant. Casting, writing beyond anything coming from American sitcoms. I have loved James Corden since The History Boys. I don't know what demographic audience the show is aiming for, but I am a 70 year old woman who thoroughly loves this show!",1527292800,,334,4.982142857142857
8610672,5,B00EZ5VF96,"Imagine A Simple Plan meets Parks and Recreation. Indeed, James Corden and Mathew Baynton, the shows creators, were inspired by the Coen Brothers film Burn After Reading. But since Corden also co-wrote the gentler Gavin and Stacey sitcom, no worries about the leads murdering each other. Instead this absurdist adventure briskly ushers the audience through the standard suspense tropes  racing against time to rescue a kidnap victim, confronting the criminals at an isolated meeting-place, eluding various menacing pursuers, and retrieving a valuable item from a sinister mansion. However, theres a twist.

A traditional romance or thriller would be all about the big picture  James Bond (or Aragorn, or Katniss Everdeen for that matter) never seem to worry about being in need of a bathroom, or running out of money when they're trying to get from one place to another. But what The Wrong Mans does well is to approach things as a comedy, focusing instead on the smaller stuff and especially what can go wrong. It's more of a human-scale adventure. And instead of just being obstacles to the plot, these mishaps become ways in which we learn more about the characters, and start to identify with them.

The protagonists are flawed to the point of being ridiculous. Yet thanks to skilled writing and performances, they are oddly sympathetic. Bayntons Sam is just the sort of guy that things keep happening to. The very first shot shows him waking up surrounded by cardboard boxes, because his girlfriend has kicked him out, and he hasn't had the heart to unpack yet. As a nice touch that the car crash that kicks off the main storyline seems to have been caused at least in part by him strolling obliviously along the wrong side of the road, as he mopes about his broken relationship.

Meanwhile, Sams associate Phil seems to be a walking showcase of all the terrible things said about James Corden on the internet. Not only is Phil an arrogant boor, we see how annoying he can be barely 30 seconds after his entrance. Phil is blissfully overconfident,  to the point where we wonder about his sanity. The scene where he bullies the hesitant Sam into going along with his plans is a hilarious bit of physical comedy, where the much shorter Phil aggressively bear hugs his less-hefty colleague. A less-talented storyteller might have gratified his own ego by portraying Phil as uber-competent. Instead, we get an overbearing, delusional loser  Jason Bourne, as envisioned by Judd Apatow. By now Corden has become adept at pushing the boundaries of a character, and must have gotten some delight out of making Phil so foolish. Theres more than a trace of darkness rooted in Phils self-centred view of the world, revealed when Sam has to prevent him from torturing the man whos become their accidental captive. But there are other layers to Phil. Hes shown to be sentimental, and submissive to his mother (Dawn French, in casting so perfect, I cant imagine anyone else in that role). In a later scene with an angry Sam, Phils vulnerability emerges  we see how lonely his life is.

The story rolls along in a goodnatured way, creating enough rapport with the audience that even a preposterous escape scene masterminded by Phil, which takes on an almost dreamlike quality, doesnt sink the plot. Jim Field Smiths adept direction helps smooth the way. But I think what really holds things together is that the characters are so well-developed  also theres more than a hint of Walter Mitty in the background, which if anythings become even more relevant in the Age of Selfies. I also appreciated that Sams girlfriend Lizzie (Sarah Solemani) isn't depicted as a prize, but an independent person with her own needs who is able to make choices.",1476316800,,3732,4.9001584786053884

8610677,5,B00EZ5VF96,"Wacky comic mystery, well written, with droll dry British humor, that is both contemporary and classic.  High performance values  acting, direction, camera-work.  One could easily binge on the series, but it's also fun to spoon it out slowly.",1469232000,,242,5.315789473684211
8610678,5,B00EZ5VF96,"James Corden, one of the writers behind the hit sit-com ""Gavin and Stacey"" co-created this show with Matthew Baynton.  The first ten minutes establish the comic darkness that propels this show, providing the humor that blends nicely with the intricately twisting plot.  Kidnappings, Russian mafia magnates, spies,corrupt public officials, and a devious femme fatale combine to make an entertaining mystery that is never cliche.  A brilliant supporting cast, including Dawn French, make this an archly intelligent show that races through weirdly staged plot events with little wasted moments.",1464912000,,591,5.693181818181818
