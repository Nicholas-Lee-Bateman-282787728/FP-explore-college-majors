1624772,5,B00005MEMY,"My three year old loves Newton.  He even wanted to do his own test to see if he dropped a big toy and a small toy on his bed if they would land at the same time like the balls in the movie.  He is full of questions every time we watch it and we talk about it often even though he may not have seen it for quite some time.  I was dubious at the ""Physics for Kids"" on the cover, but I have been a believer since the first time I watched it.  I just bought three copies to give as gifts to my sons friends.",1054252800,2,503,3.6296296296296298
1624773,5,B00005MEMY,"I balked at the ambitious title and the ""physics for kids"" tag line when my wife brought it home from the library.  Boy was I in for a huge surprise when we watched it with my 3 year old son.  It is brilliant.  It is certainly fun and the music is entertaining, but what blew my mind was that my son got it.  He actually started asking questions and I had to go download the parent's guide off the web.  He asks for this video more than any other and I am ready for the DVD.  We even have tried our own experiments like dropping different size toys onto his bed to see if they fall like the balls in the movie.  The creators have really done something amazing by taking science and making it not only entertaining, but accessible to a toddler.  I would never have believed it if I had not seen it for myself.  Don't miss out on this, it is a real jewel.",1044662400,3,853,4.059880239520958
1624774,5,B00005MEMY,"Finally, a kids video that teaches, entertains, and isn't full of bee-bop nonsense!  Our 4 year old boy and 6 month old girl both LOVE it!  Highly recommended!",1038009600,,159,4.642857142857143
1624775,5,B00005MEMY,My two boys ages 6 and 3 were immediately captivated by this innovative and highly creative DVD. They are fascinated by Max the Cat and follow him excitedly as he learns the basic laws of physics. They both ask to watch it again and again. My youngest boy especially loves the music and dances throughout the entire 30 minutes. We hope this is the first in a series. Highly recommend!,1037491200,,384,4.5
1624776,5,B00005MEMY,"We received this video as a gift, mainly for our 1 1/2 year old, but it's a hit with our five year old as well.  They can watch it together and actually both laugh out loud at the cat's antics.  It's even intriguing for parents to watch the ball, rolling from place to place.  Puts everyone in a zen state of mind.",1015891200,4,314,4.032258064516129
1624777,5,B00005MEMY,"My kids, 5 and 8, enjoyed this video and their cousins, 1, 3 and 4 want to see it again and again. As a parent and careful media consumer I like it that the images are more like physical reality and less like MTV and Grimms fairy tales. Well thought out, fun and playful it inspired my kids to take out their Legos and build their own gizmos.",1004918400,3,342,4.044117647058823

7945336,5,B00005MEMY,"We had this when my daughter was a toddler.  During Hurricane Irene our house flooded and some of the old photos, VHS tapes and other things were destroyed by the flood.  My daughter mentioned a couple months ago that, even though she's 14 now, she'd love to see this again. So, I've been looking. Found it here at a great price and gave it to her for Christmas. She was so happy to watch it again and I can't thank you enough for making it available and shipping so quickly.  Thank you",1419897600,,486,4.260869565217392
7945337,4,B00005MEMY,"We first found this video at our library and I was surprised by how much my kids love it.  They giggle at the cat and like to watch him work the contraptions.  I thought the video was a little corny at first, but they really enjoy watching it.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes the Baby Einstein videos.",1231718400,,311,4.15
7945338,5,B00005MEMY,"This is a ""starter video"" for children to learn Physics.  Its catchy music and familar objects introduce basic principles of physics in a unique and intriguing way.  All three of my grandchildren absolutely love this video.  When these principles of physics are taught in school to my grandchildren, I am certain that engrained memories of this video will prove valuable in the more formal academic approach.  I highly recommend this video for even the youngest of audiences.",1184198400,,475,5.12987012987013
7945339,5,B00005MEMY,The kids were entralled by Max the Cat.  It was nice to have an alternative to the Baby Einstein videos.  The graphics were interesting and the music was not irritating or jarring (unlike some kids' videos).,1181952000,,207,4.722222222222222
7945340,5,B00005MEMY,"This video is great for many reasons. The music is fun and includes a wide variety of genres. The physics concepts may be enjoyed from a purely aesthetic viewpoint, followed by some appreciatation for what is actually being portrayed. Plus, it's just satifying to see a small production team come up with something so elegant, sans the heavy hand of Disney. My 4-year-old and my-1-year old both enjoy this alot. When you really just have to plop them down in front of a video for a while, it's nice to have something with a little depth to choose from. I can't find the website for the production company anymore, so I'm not sure if they will ever complete the second video they were planning. I hope they do someday.",1149724800,,717,4.565891472868217
7945341,5,B00005MEMY,"I teach kindergarten. My class not only enjoyed it.  They wanted to see it again and again and again.  I can't tell you how wonderful a video it is.  The music accompanyment enthralls and

captivates the children.  ""I like this!""  ""This is my favorite!""

they would say.  Building block time and the children wanted a

ball so they could create Max the cat.  Again, forget the negatives....do your child a favor...you won't be sorry.",1145491200,,433,4.72972972972973
7945342,5,B00005MEMY,"This is the best educational video I have found for infants and toddlers. It out performs Baby Mozart hands down!! It presents principles of physics, light, and planetary motion in a very creative and colorful format -  and it has great music. I highly recommend this video for anyone who wants their young kids to watch something other than cartoons and actually learn something about science!",1120521600,,394,4.96969696969697
7945343,5,B00005MEMY,"This is a wonderful dvd, great animation , interesting music and very clever way to introduce physics to your kids. Our  15 month old twins wanted to see this dvd over and over and they were completely captivated by it.

I would highly recommend this for toddlers and young children. When the next installment of this comes out we will buy it right away.",1106784000,4,354,4.515625
7945344,3,B00005MEMY,My two year old is not interested in the video.  I think this would be excellent for a younger child.  The video is more along the lines of Baby Mozart than something geared for toddlers.  The parents guide was not in the DVD case.,1094774400,,231,4.204545454545454
7945345,1,B00005MEMY,"We were expecting at least a decent video according to the raving reviews on the site.  Unfortunately, the video is very short and the parts that repeat most have no educational value whatsoever.  It is a waste of money and our son does not like the video at all, neither do we!!!  Getting some Amazing Animals videos are a better investment and children are bound to love Henry the lizard.  The videos are better priced and packed with information.  Newton is a bottle is a well advertised waste of money.",1069804800,,506,4.5777777777777775
