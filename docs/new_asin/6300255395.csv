7807494,3,6300255395,This was based on a true story.  My husband's family lived next door to JR (Jack) in Georgia.  It actually happened in 1949.  I had heard the family talk about the sad event for years.  So glad to have found the movie and the book (Here to Get My Baby Out of Jail) on Amazon.,1522713600,,275,3.9454545454545453

7807498,4,6300255395,"One of my favorite movies...straight forward, wonderfully simple in that you can relate to it. Everything is real: the characters, scenery and it almost feels like I am young again in the telling of the story! To me, it feels like the pace and places  of  the summers that I had growing up. Although I didn't live their story.
 It is amazing to see the young Lori Singer, Kathy Bates, Bruce Abbott and Anthony Edwards, You watch Lori Singer's character  grow from docile puppet to a strong woman. It all just feels like a easier time, tho, of course, it wasn't...",1410652800,,563,4.544554455445544
7807499,5,6300255395,"This film was filmed in near my home town back when I was in grade school; I saw this film back in the late 90's and enjoyed the film because it brought back memories of back home.  I'm in my early 40's and I now live in Washington,DC  but I still have memories of how it use to be; I was able to find this film on amazon and I knew I had to have it to add to my collection. The viewing experience was what I remembered it to be sad but comforting to see how far I have come and where it all began. If you are from the south and would like to see a film that will take back down memory lane, this is the film for you.",1400198400,,617,3.6666666666666665
7807500,5,6300255395,Good 1920's movie with pre-depression atmosphere. Shows what can happen with marriage and adultry entering the picture. a typical story of illicit love. I feel Lori Singer was excellent.,1360195200,4,186,5.448275862068965
7807501,4,6300255395,"The year is 1937, and twenty-one-year-old Roxie, an isolated and lonely farm wife, will succumb to the charms of a drifter.  The choices she makes that summer will change everything.
This film is based on the breathtaking little novel ""Here to Get My Baby Out of Jail"" by Louise Shivers.  While the film has none of the brilliance of the book, the beauty of Ms. Shiver's prose does creep into the script every now and then.  The farm scenes with the old house, barns and animals are so real you can practically smell the place, and the mysterious qualities of Roxie's upbringing add a surrealness.  Singer, appropriately stiff in her roll, is complimented well by the perfection of the wonderful Clu Gulager, who plays her father and the equally wonderful, and rather slim, Kathy Bates as her stepmother.  Anthony Edwards seems plucked right out of the novel's pages.
One of the best touches in the film is the narrator, done by the beautiful Dorothy McGuire.  Her rich comforting voice, which quotes directly from the novel, draws you instantly into Roxie's world and will make you want to run out and buy the book, now in its third printing.
Make sure you listen to the last song that plays during the credits.  No one but Kim Carnes could do justice to the song ""The Heart Must Have a Home.""  The raspiness of her voice successfully marries the two clear themes of this story, adultery and devastation.",1074988800,12,1405,4.706122448979592
