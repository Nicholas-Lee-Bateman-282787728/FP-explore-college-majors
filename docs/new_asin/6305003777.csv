7880534,5,6305003777,"Tsukamoto crafts a perverse inversion of the usual love triangle in cinema--here, we have a hate triangle.

Three damaged citizens of ultramodern Tokyo-a milquetoast Dilbertesque salaryman cubicle drone, a bored, underappreciated housewife, and a traumatized semi-pro boxer-enter into a dance of death. See, the boxer and the salaryman have a shared history. The salaryman has done his level best to forget their past together, and the promises and oaths they swore to one another. The boxer intrudes on his life, causing the salaryman to question his existence and armor up for the ultimate enemy . . .

Meanwhile, the housewife is charged by the violent, brutish physicality of the boxer, and journeys down her own masochistic road of discovery.

True auteur Shinya Tsukamoto writes, directs, edits, art directs, takes charge of the cinematography, etc. Chu Ishikawa composes a punishing, awe-demanding score. Tsukamoto also plays the role of the salaryman. Real life sibling Koji Tsukamoto plays the boxer, and Kaori Fujii plays the housewife.

Tsukamoto creates a psychokinetic explosion of rage, frustration, self-mutilation, and brawling that plays counterpoint to the vast, implacable modern edifice of Tokyo. It isn't a completely rational or plot-based experience, so do not go into this with the expectation of a naturalistic drama or a morality play centered around boxing like Body and Soul. It has much more in common with Tsukamoto's Tetsuo films than Raging Bull or any other classic boxing drama.

Highly recommended!",1281052800,,1533,5.42436974789916
7880535,3,6305003777,"Got this movie my mistake from Blockbuster, there was wrong DVD in the box. However, a great story. But one thing is bad about this movie there is way too much blood. For no particular purpose. If the movie has less crappy scenes with blood streaming out of heads like water fountains, the movie would perhaps win an oscar. Movie like this can only end up on a pile of crap. A horor? Come on. Ridiculous. Therefore 5-2=3 stars for too much blood.",1201132800,,446,4.385542168674699
7880536,5,6305003777,"man this film was one hell of a ride. the cinematography was beautiful as always(the back & forth reel shots; the speeding shots throughout the city alleyways, reminiscent of Tetsuo & Bullet Ballet) the story was the director's best next to Vital, though i was much more impressed by the visuals particularly his intense imagery of boxing & all the ferociously shot scenes vigorously depicting men practicing in a boxing gym as if they're robots training for battle.

i was most impressed by Tsukamoto's brother's role in the film amongst the others. everyone delivered flawlessly, but he was beyond exceptional in playing the most mysterious character of the three. like i said before, the story was amazing & very unique, particularly the mystery surrounding Kojima & how the character serves as a bitter catalyst to the chaos that takes form around them.

the film was very unconvential & unpredictable, much like most of Tsukamoto's work & even though it is so story-driven, it still is one of the most abstract works the director has created. i really enjoyed how the characters of Tsuda & Kojima really looked a lot like eachother yet were, personality-wise, polar-opposites(yes, they're brothers in real life, but i think maybe Tsukamoto did that on purpose) the film feels a lot like it's one of the director's more personal works. it truly is a feast for the eyes & it lets people like myself feel good to know how great movies can be. it isn't anywhere as out there as the Tetsuo films, but if you are into them or any of Tsukamoto's work, then this is very worth checking out. i'd even put it up there as one of his top 3.",1169164800,,1633,4.706293706293707
7880537,5,6305003777,"I just want to mention that although this movie is extremely good it is compared to Fight Club far too much.  Everyone says it's the Japanese Fight Club, but the only similarity is that there happens to be some fighting in both movies.  You might as well compare the next Van Damme movie to Fight Club.  But if you are a fan of Japanese films you won't be disappointed.  It might not be as wicked as The Iron Man or Visitor Q, but it's still really good.",1087257600,,454,4.183908045977011
7880538,4,6305003777,"Thinking this was ""just"" a Japanese movie, I found Tokyo Fist anything but. Its raw unsubtle imagery -- not to mention over-the-top boxing ""makeup"", made me quite happy that I was watching this on an empty stomach. Yet, despite the human imagery of violence and spiraling downward, the sterility and facelessness of Tokyo itself is quite powerful -- more frightening, since it's the only part of the movie that doesn't seem impossible. The film is primarily shot in alienating, washed out blues, with red the primary visual for contrasting, jarring, color scenes. Sensibility and plot take a firm back seat to evocation and statement. It's kinetic, low-budget, and relentless, yet not at all preachy or pretentious.",1026432000,2,715,5.172413793103448
7880539,4,6305003777,"Truthfully, I'm not sure what the other reviews are complaining about: ""Tokyo Fist"" is arguably more coherent than ""Tetsuo"", although it's hardly a finely tuned plot.  Nor are the goings-on more extreme than in ""Tetsuo.""  The tattoos and piercings are not ""ritual""; in fact, they're pretty direct self-mutilation and alteration.  I really don't understand why this is slapped with ""Warning: Adult Content"" labels, because frankly, the American cinema has seen much worse.
The ""Fight Club"" paralells people draw are also very misleading; first of all, the plots are nothing alike.  This is more similar to ""Tetsuo"" than anything else.  Second, this is in terms of direction simply a better film.  It's obvious Tsukamoto sat down and thought hard about how exactly he wanted each shot to be presented, whereas David Fincher tried to assault the senses by NOT thinking.  It's not as digestible to American audiences, but them's the breaks.
Tsukamoto's distinct directorial style (there's even a little stop-motion here) is better defined here, especially his use of color.  His ""video game"" style is very much present here, and while it's not for everyone, if you're interested in being challenged, it's probably for you.  It's also a good lead-in to ""Tetsuo"", although the same warning there applies here: if you haven't sampled of David Cronenberg, David Lynch and a few other ""perverse"" filmmakers, I'd step carefully.",1015459200,4,1418,5.238938053097345
7880540,3,6305003777,"Shinya Tsukamoto has definitely matured a great deal since Tetsuo.  This is one of those movies that have a few really incredible moments and some not so interesting, slow moving parts.  The 'good parts' of this film are very, very good though. The violence is very over the top and the makeup is quite grotesque.  I find that the makeup in Asian films, although not as flawless as Hollywood makeup, is always tough to take.  After a character endures a brutal beating (in this film the aforementioned beatings are sometimes self afflicted) their face is covered in blood and various horrible contusions, bruises, etc.  While not an incredible movie throughout the climax, which is made up of a montage between the three main characters, is incredible.  I'm not really sure who to recommend this movie to since it's not very similar to Tsukamoto's earlier efforts.  It's  one of those very original, very cool movies that you won't want to buy but will be very happy you experienced it.",994809600,4,986,4.8273809523809526
7880541,2,6305003777,"Being a survivor of both Tetsuo and Tetsuo 2 before watching this film, I felt I was ready for anything Tsukamato could ever think of throwing at his core audience. What I was unprepared for was gore in bucket loads and a  plot even hazier than the aforementioned films. Although it seems to be the  director's style to have a less than linear plot and even less editing to a  movie, Tokyo Fist seems to me as a failed attempt at a boxing movie.  Self-mutilation, childhood rivalry, and a self-destructive path covers the  visuals of what could possibly be the sickest overseas movie I've seen in a  while. The strange thing about this movie is that it had more than it's  fair share of potential. With a little storyline twist here, a little less  over acting there, and a little more realistic fights on the side would've  made this a good buy. Unfortunately, Tsukamato's taste for the bizzare,  intense, and sadistic visuals somewhat ruined this movie. So why didn't I  just give this a one star instead of two? Simple, any movie that makes you  wanna barf 90 percent of the time deserves an extra star for effort.  Another demented movie(with no real point) from a really demented  director(who seems to have some serious issues to deal with).",948067200,,1247,4.660550458715596
7880542,5,6305003777,"Shinya Tsukamoto has improved significantly since his 1988 release of Tetsuo:the iron man.  This film has shots in it that spin my brain around.  The tone to this film is one of conflict, both physical and emotional.  The  two rivals are bonded by a faded vow that one no longer even cares about.  When the other steals his fiance he soon begins to walk a path of  vengeance.  The final resolution is dramatic to say the least.  Keep an eye  on the way Shinya intensifies scenes by rumbling the shot about.  If you  are a fan and are not sure about this one, trust me it is his best so far.  I really didn't like that they put some stupid anti-drug commercial on the  DVD though, those kinds of things should only be on television.",942537600,4,731,4.325925925925926
7880543,5,6305003777,"Tokyo Fist shows the development of Shinya Tsukamoto's directorial skills. While Tokyo Fist still contains the brilliant, over the top visuals of the Tetsuo series(used to great effect in the boxing ring), he allows the camera and film to be calm, allowing story, thought and emotion to enter. There is strong character development in this one as the protagonists try to understand how one can feel and be alive in a cold city. Definetly not recommended  for the squeamish as Tsukamoto has to no issue with placing the grotesque in your face.",911865600,7,542,4.891304347826087
