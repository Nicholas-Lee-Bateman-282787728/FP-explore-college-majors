8512306,5,B0078FCERM,"POLIS IS THIS is a nearly archaeological study of Charles Olson's later years as he roams Gloucester, Massachusetts, his home, and talks us through his poetry, mostly selections of his epic masterpiece THE MAXIMUS POEMS. His passion is undeniable as he faces the sea, his eyes gazing through the centuries. He is present and past, fully embodied in one soul. His mind never stops, and the fascination of his thought-process is breath-taking to witness. There is an intimacy here seldom experienced, and this would hopefully drive the viewer back to Olson's poems. We follow this evocative thinker in verite style, and we feel the spray of the shore upon us as he trumpets his notions of history. An extraordinary portrait.",1431129600,,722,5.025
