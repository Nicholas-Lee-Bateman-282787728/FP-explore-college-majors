2102879,5,B0002LE9QS,"Once upon a time, way back in the 1970?s, there was a magical land called Southern California. It was in this place that two brothers, Richard and Danny Elfman, devised an avant-garde musical comedy troupe, called The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo. In 1980, they decided to form a loose story based around some of their performance pieces and make a movie. That movie is the legendary Forbidden Zone. Since my fourteen-year old vhs tape of this movie is rotting on the shelf as I write this, I couldn?t be happier to see its release on dvd.
Okay, the film is a certified nut case of a movie, filmed over the course of maybe a week in and around the LA area. It?s in black and white, not because of any artistic vision ? it was just cheaper that way. But it works ? the film is a (tribute, send up?) of 1930?s era musicals, with standout music by Josephine Baker and Cab Calloway and centers around the Hercules family and the strange portal to the 6th Dimension that exists in their basement. The world this takes place in is filled with strange imagery, amazing music, and more oddities than a sane person could hope to count. We have a human-size dancing frog, jockstrap-clad Kipper Kids, Herv? Villechaize as the king of the 6th Dimension, a chicken-boy who is able to communicate telepathically with his transvestite brother, Joe Spinell as a drunker sailor, classroom violence, a Jewish wrestler fighting a guy in an ape suit, and Danny Elfman playing Satan while singing ?Minnie the Moocher.?  You get the idea; this is not a normal film. Although it borrows from the works of Olsen & Johnson (Hellzapoppin? & Crazy House), this is still a truly unique cinema experience.
The advance word from Richard Elfman is that this dvd will have a re-mastered print of the film, deleted scenes, interviews, and archival footage! For any fan of Danny Elfman, Oingo Boingo, or just incredibly strange films made by talented people, you simply can?t miss this one.",1089590400,30,1962,4.6869565217391305

The Blu-ray transfer is about as good as you could hope for when it comes to a cult classic done on what budget they had.

I'll eventually edit this to give a proper review for the movie. All I can say is don't get your underwear in a twist, the movie is all done for the sake of entertaining and humor. Not to offend.

BUT! How can you NOT love a movie where some of the first black people/African Americans are done up in black face?!

2102935,5,B0002LE9QS,"This is one wild cult movie.  Made in the 80's and originally filmed in B & W, it has been colorized for this DVD version.
This is not for the kids.  Before you view the film look at the clip where Richard Elfman the producer gives some background about the film.
From what I read, it was financed by the cast most of which were not even paid.  It is like a play that was filmed.
It is a totally bizarre cult film with super cheap special effects (if you can call them special!).  But it is def. worth viewing simply because it is so crazy and surreal.  The classroom scenes a totally hilarious, along with several others.  If you are easily offended, this film is not for you.  It stereo-types just about everyone.  If it were made today the PC police would be all over it!  Many of the included songs are from the 30's and 40's, along with Danny Elfman's original music.  Danny BTW, has graduated to doing big Hollywood movie soundtracks, e.g. Batman and Disney films, etc.

If you like cult films, this is a must see - right up there with Eraser Head.  I give it 5 stars because of it's unique entertainment value.

2102960,5,B0002LE9QS,"This is my favorite movie. I was very unhappy with the color version. Its supposed to be black and white. In the black and white version, the painted backgrounds look 3D. In my opinion, the color ruined the film. It took away the wonder and fantasy factor. This film came out in 1980. I can tell it was meant to be in black and white due to the black and white backgrounds which are amazing in black and white, but don't work in color. It's sad. This is a 5 star movie, but the color version should get 2 stars. It really is that much different. WE WANT THE ORIGINAL VERSION!
UPDATE! I purchased this film from amazon probably a couple years ago as its my favorite movie. Now it is ""unavailable in my area""!!! I am downright furious as this film is very hard to find. I've been paying for prime for years and the one movie I really want and the only one I've ever purchased has been slyly stolen from me. I'm angry! On another note, prime was decent at first, then they slowly removed all the good movies from prime. All that's on prime now is very lousy crap. Why would I pay ten or twelve dollars to download a movie onto a tablet that will get lost or broken? For that price I can just buy physical DVD copies and own them forever. Prime is going the way of YouTube, down the toilet right next to MySpace. I'm not happy about it, but it is fact. Its not hard to see the future. Once the good or edgy content is squeezed out, either by censorship or greed, its on life support. Hence CNN, NBC, etc. get with the program people, jeez.",1450569600,,1535,4.1891891891891895
2102961,5,B0002LE9QS,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

Ive been a fan of Danny Elfman for a long, LONG time.  As the lead singer for Oingo Boingo back in the late 70s and early 80s, Elfman quickly made a name for himself as a composer and songwriter.  But when he turned to movie scores in the mid 80s, my fandom skyrocketed.  Ive loved many of his movie soundtracks, particularly BEETLEJUICE, BATMAN, NIGHTBREED, EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, and THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS.  So when I heard he had performed and acted in a quirky, low-budget film made by his brother, I knew I had to give it a look.  And Im so glad I did!  FORBIDDEN ZONE is a crazy trip into the bizarre, chocked full of surreal imagery and moody but fantastic music.

I guarantee youve never seen a film like this before.  And if you think you have, you were probably on drugs.  This movie is a fever-dream you won't want to wake up from.

FORBIDDEN ZONE is shot well for being a low-budget picture, and looks pretty good onscreen.  I understand the movie was originally shot in black-and-white, but recently colorized in 2008; the fine folks at MVD Distribution have included both on the Ultimate Edition Blu-ray, and watching both versions is a real treat.  I found it interesting to see the differences the color can make.  Both are entertaining, but the black-and-white version is somewhat more bizarre for some reason.

The acting is pretty good, although I don't think anybody will win any awards.  The cast does a good job as a whole, although I have to commend Danny Elfman on his portrayal of the Devil.  In addition to foreboding zaniness, Elfman brings true musical talent to Old Scratchs persona.

The special effects are cheesy, but the movie is still a visual feast to behold.  The set pieces remind me of a Salvador Dali painting, and the atmosphere they help create is beyond astounding.  If you're in the mood for weird but entertaining, FORBIDDEN ZONE is the movie for you.

FORBIDDEN ZONE is a major win for me, and I highly recommend it.  The Ultimate Edition includes the movies soundtrack on CD, so be sure and snag this version so you can enjoy the music everywhere you go.  I can almost guarantee youll find a song or two thatll stick in your mind long after the film is over.  But regardless of what version you buy, check this film out soon.  Youll take a heck of a trip, and it will be one youll want to take again and again.  The film is available now.",1450224000,2,2464,4.518099547511312

2102986,3,B0002LE9QS,"This is a review of the Fantoma B&W 1 Disc edition

This is one odd film!

My take away is that it was STRONGLY influenced by & a tribute to Rocky Horror (with some significant differences) & while it has some great moments (Danny Elfman doing a superb Cab Calloway imitation as the Devil singing Minnie The Moocher with different lyrics), the story & acting doesn't equal Rocky; but it's worth a watch. There's also no Tim Curry, or Susan Sarandon; no actor here is even close

Before Oingo Boingo was a Rock band, & before Danny Elfman was a sought after film scorer, Danny & his brother had a stage musical troupe called ""7 Knights Of Oingo Boingo"". This was sort of there culminating moment (in fact, while never a Boingo fan, I found the various extras with some early footage of the 7 Knights stage show more interesting than the film.)

Other then inferior writing (by comparison), there are a lot of obviously intentional similarities with Rocky Horror; in fact I see this as a tribute.

Here's the differences. Rocky parodies 30's-50's b-flick horror & sci-fi cinema (every time I watch Rocky I pick up a subtle reference I never saw before), & a very odd combo of 50's, Broadway, & glam rock as filtered through a mid 70's musical lens.

Zone focuses cinematically on the 20's & early-mid 30's: Max Fleischer (Betty Boop), & to a lesser degree 20's German expressionism; musically it's 20's - mid 30's (especially Cab Calloway; they also mention Josephine Baker in one of the documentaries), as filtered through an 80's new age lens.

The film works best when they're doing the various 20's parodies. The animation sequences are also well done.

Much of the other writing falls short (there isn't much of a plot); but not many troupes are going to produce the amazing quality of Rocky Horror on there 1st try. The only similar film I'm aware of that came close was Liquid Sky.

To sum up, this is worth a watch for fans of Betty Boop/ Max Fleischer, Cab Calloway (whom I consider to be a HUGE influence on James Brown, Sly Stone & Prince), Boingo, those who enjoy weirdness for weirdness sake (kind of like me, lol) & those willing to be forgiving of extremely amateurish writing in exchange for the occasional giggle.

While it's definitely a light ""R"", it is also definitely not for kids. It is slightly more explicit then Rocky (slightly is the key; one actress never wears a top), but also the fake boinking scenes (I used that silly word in hopes of escaping Amazon's filters) are slightly more explicit & are on the maturity level of Beavis & Butt-Head.",1438560000,,2569,4.626373626373627

This film is a forced-contrived attempt at setting out to make a ""Midnite Movie"". I'm always happy to see the great Suasan Tyrell pick up a check,but this whole thing appears to look like an old Betty Boop cartoon brought to life.. It has a forced and unspirited vibe to it. It's as if the creators set out and thought,Hey! Let's make a wild movie.. Let's approach it and add elements that will surely make this movie an instant-cult classic!! Maybe I just ""Don't get it"".. The film takes place in ""The 6th de-men-scion"" as the characters indicate. It's smug in every element. It's not fun. It's not clever. It's not witty. It really seems just out of place in every aspect. Annoying,obnoxious and irritating. The images are so disjointed as if brought from a weird nightmare you wake up from just scratching your head. I watched this fim twice. The second was to show a friend who later thanked me for the tension knot he developed in the back of his neck after sitting through it. Sorry,Mr. Elfman,but your soundtrack is the only remotely interesting element to this film. Want GENUINE creative noir film making that doesn't have an obvious agenda?

It's like ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" as directed by Salvador Dali or a PBS children's show produced by Captain Beefheart... it's nice and twisted up with lots of jazz, gallows humor, and surreal plot twists.  You know a movie has achieved something above average when people who have seen this for the first time keep wondering how many drugs everyone was on during the making of, and you keep insisting that if the special features are to be believed, no one was strung out on anything, really.  The only other film I can think of that is this strange and produced by mostly sober people was Frank Zappa's ""Baby Snakes.""

Bonus features on the Arrow edition are worthwhile.  There's a nice making-of documentary and plenty of other entertaining odds and ends.  Not to mention you've got your choice between original black and white or a recently colorized version.  I prefer the original B & W but the color version isn't bad at all.

The humor in this movie is very coarse.  If you keep in mind what comedians like Lenny Bruce did for the world, it's no big deal, but there is a chance it might upset or disturb someone out there.

Elfman's trippy. nightmarish musical romp in the 6th Dimension is filled with great old 1930s recordings, like Cab Calloway's ""Some of These Days,"" ""Pico and Sepulvida,"" ""Bim Bam Boom"" and Josephine Baker's ""Pleure.""

It's here that we meet dwarfish King Fausto (Villechaize), his lusty bride Queen Doris (Tyrell), the Princess (Lindley) and Bust Rod, the Servant Frog (Schwartz). The Kipper Kids (Routh and von Haselberg) ""box"" each other while they face the camera and flail at the air. Earthly visitors to this bizarre world are topless babe Frenchy Hercules (Marie-Pascale Elfman), Flash Hercules (Gordon), Grampa (Diamond) and Squeezit, the human chicken boy (Bright).

Frenchy enters the 6th Dimension through a mysterious portal in her home. When King Fausto falls in love with her, Queen Doris has Frenchy imprisoned and tortured. Squeezit and the Hercules family come to Frenchy's aid, but who will rescue them from the Forbidden Zone?

2103105,1,B0002LE9QS,"I first saw this when it was picked as a suggestion from my TiVo system. I like Danny Elfman and thought it might be interesting. On top of that, I'm a fan of Max Fleischer's work, and this started out with the look and feel of his 30s cartoon. With both of those, I thought it would hold my interest. I was wrong. Just a few minutes in, and I had the fast forward button down. I ran through it in about 15 minutes, and thought that was it.

Afterwards, I read some of the other reviews here and figured I didn't give it enough of a chance. I recorded it again and watched it through. There's 75 minutes of my life I'm not getting back.

I can't believe there aren't more bad reviews. Perhaps it's because there's a limited number of ways to say this is a waste of time?

The movie comes across as though it was made by a few junior high kids ready to outrage the world and thinking they can with breasts, profanity, and puke jokes. The characters are flat. The parody of ""Swinging the Alphabet"" is lame, essentially cobbling the tune, getting through A - E, hitting the obvious profanity at ""F"", and then having no idea where to go. The trip through the intestines to the expected landing doesn't work the first time, let alone the following ones.

Across the board, the entire movie is what you would expect from someone trying to ""out-South Park"" Stone and Parker without the ability to determine what is and isn't funny. This might be amusing if you're high. Otherwise, it's not.",1312070400,4,1483,4.381818181818182

2103107,4,B0002LE9QS,"FORBIDDEN ZONE (1982) was colorized with the approval of director Richard Elfman, who in a bonus feature on this LEGEND FILMS disc admits that he originally envisioned having a master print hand-tinted by Chinese ladies.

This is one of those bizarre pictures that folks of a certain age (such as myself) used to watch while under the influence of illegal substances, and like a good buzz, it's most enjoyable for an hour; then the pleasure wears off.

There's so much here that I'm fond of: The Yiddishe Charleston, a human chandelier, Danny Elfman's superb rendering of Minnie the Moocher, his moody piano during the Fausto and Doris dinner scene, Bim Bam Boom, Squeezit, a demented Swinging the Alphabet, Froggy, The Kipper Kids, Pico and Sepulvida, Flash Hercules, Witch's Egg-- yet this all takes place within that first 60 minutes. From the torture scene on the movie fast loses momentum and in fact seems to grope for an ending. When we reach the final ""big number"" my reaction is always the same: embarrassment for having indulged the latent teenager in me.

Yes I'll undoubtedly watch FORBIDDEN ZONE in the future and will surely come away from the experience feeling guilty all over again. But I so LOVE that first hour!

But nowhere in the description of this item does it mention that it's been colorized, and is not the glorious black-and-white version I watched dozens of times from the front row of the Beverly Theater in Los Angeles in the early 1980s.

After receiving the DVD and finding out it had been monkeyed with, I returned to the product page and actually had to click on the ""See larger image"" link to make out the words ""In Color for the first time!""  I ended up purchasing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/another-version/dp/B0002LE9QS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">another version</a>&nbsp;that was spared the abomination Ted Turner hath wrought.

I have since read, in reference to this DVD, that Richard Elfman had originally intended to have the movie hand-tinted in Asia before being released, but didn't have the funding.  If this is indeed true, then good for him and I'm glad he has finally gotten his vision on the screen.  But frankly this smacks of revisionism.  It reminds me of the desperate justifications Spielberg made for his unforgivable digital vandalism of Kubrick's ""Eyes Wide Shut.""

Think about it: this is a film shot on a nonexistent budget, literally using cardboard sets, starring mostly unknown actors and featuring music that was either composed by the director's brother or so old it was in the public domain.  Hand-tinting a movie is an insanely expensive and time-consuming process; even during the silent era when labor was cheap it was rarely done, and generally reserved for films expected to make boatloads of money.

My suspicion is that ""Forbidden Zone"" was colorized simply because the producers wanted to sell more copies, and far too many people are morons that refuse to watch anything in black-and-white.  I hope I'm completely wrong about this, and Richard Elfman really DID dream of having every frame of his twisted epic carefully painted by hand.

Like pan-and-scan and ""full frame"" versions of wide-screen films, colorization is spitting in the face of the cinematographer and should not be tolerated.  I ended up not returning the color version because I wanted the filmmakers to have the money and there's the chance that the colorization was planned, but if it hadn't been this particular movie I would have sent it back without a second thought.  The movie itself is absolutely fantastic and everyone involved should be showered in gold.

This movie has got it all: sexy girls, catchy songs, charming characters. The soundtrack and the sound effects are perfectly crafted, and the visuals, as strange as it may sound, are both warm and alienating at the same time, with a lot of drawings of the kind you could see in underground magazines or in the rooms of cool teenagers decades ago.

Like a lot of boomers I grew up watching a lot of old 1930's films on TV: The Stooges, Bowery Boys, Betty Boop, et al. This movie summons all that in glorious nostalgic detail, but (and this is the key) it does so without the fake ""innocence"" of old Hollywood and let the excrement, swearing and naughty bits fall where they may. Its weirdly precise chaotic poetry seems insane at first, but the truth is that the story  isn't all that far from what a typical Grecian myth synopsis reads like, only here it is enacted by lunatics, drug addicts, tap dancers, punk stars and some occasional 2-dimensional cartoon characters. Wisely, the filmmakers don't bother with actual jokes, they just shock and shock and shock you again with audacious sophomoric imagery plumbed from the depths of the American psyche. Whether you hate it or love it, you will have a hard time forgetting it.

It was great to see this in an age when nice but tame films like NAPOLEON DYNAMITE and JUNO are hailed as ""indie"" visions. Watch this (and throw in a few John Waters' classics) and you'll learn the true meaning of ""indie""!",1252886400,3,1269,4.489177489177489

Based on the demented world of Elfman's band, the Mystical Knights of Oingo-Boingo, now you too can watch Forbidden Zone from the comfort of your own home, courtesy of Amazon VOD.

As you can no doubt tell from the preview video, this version of the film has been digitally enhanced and colorized--to great effect--in keeping with the director's original intentions.

2103153,5,B0002LE9QS,"At once both demented and enthralling, Forbidden Zone is a sensory romp through the twisted mind of musical genius Danny Elfman and the imaginary world inspired by the off-color performances of his oddly-named baned, the Mystic Knights of Oingo-Boingo.  Because of its heretofore unsurpassed irreverence, Forbidden Zone is a must-own for any fan of the B-movie genre.

This being another Legend Films release, its marquee selling-point is the addition of color to the original black and white film.  Now, before anyone gets up-in-arms, remember that this is one of those films that the Director had originally intended to be viewed in color, but he was constrained from realizing his vision due to budgetary and practicality concerns (the technology wasn't that fantastic thirty years ago).  More than anything, Legend's colorization represents the satisfaction of Director Elfman's original intent and desire.  And having seen both versions, I can assure you that the additional rainbow really brings out the Tim Burton-esque zaniness that the movie tries to achieve.

Since music was both the inspiration for and a highlight of this film, I think the 5.1 Dolby audio provided on this DVD deserves special mention.

Special features include subtitles, in-movie trivia (ala Pop-up Video) and deleted/cut scenes.",1227571200,3,1311,5.428571428571429
2103154,5,B0002LE9QS,"I just got done watching Forbidden Zone and It was quite the experience.
First off, It's probably the most unique and original film I've ever seen in my life.
It's got an identity all of its own and a lot of personality that just shines right through.
The anti-PC'ness of the film, the blatant sexuality, nudity, anything that you could possibly find vulgar or offensive you just need to shrug off because once things happen in the Sixth Dimension, Your own natural logic does NOT apply.
The Sixth Dimension is a living, breathing surreal nightmare of disturbing characters doing disturbing things and the animation and cinematography, the fact that the characters seem to be playing themselves just for you - It's all too much, It feels like you are in the audience watching your own nightmares come to life, but you can't take your eyes away and your mind and heart are completely consumed in this world.

The music has to be my favorite part of the film, The music is so unique and original and has a lot of class and soul. It's beautiful and I'm very eager to be hearing the soundtrack again soon.

The sets are amazing, the attention to detail is fantastic and sets the whole vibe of the film as being an intricate fantasy-land.

The Actors are very talented and very convincing as the characters they portray; My favorite being Susan Tyrrell, There's too much to be said about this woman; She's amazing, She's a true performer and gives so much energy and spirit in film it's hard not to keep your attention focused on her. The characters are all very great and have a very good chemistry with one another and work very well in the environment of the Sixth Dimension.

The story itself unfolds like a fairy-tale; Watching this movie I felt like I was being told a bed-time story by my shell-shocked senile aunt with absolutely no tact or awareness of the story itself having such disturbing elements, Because while the material can be offensive; It can come off very strongly and very intensely, The softness of the characters, The Beauty of the background and the Amazing music sets you off into a very deep and very lucid sleep and You don't want to be turning away from this world that has been unraveled for you.

With a deep appreciation for John Waters films, Fleischer animation, Contagious Music and Characters and Surreal things in general; I urge you to give this movie a chance, with an open mind and an open heart because it has truly given me a new found appreciation and enthusiasm for entertainment that is a harsh commodity with the pretentiousness and 'weird or obscure for the sake of it' going on.",1225756800,4,2622,4.654427645788337

2103156,2,B0002LE9QS,"Wavering on the very border of artistic and vulgar, Richard Elfman's cult classic Forbidden Zone strives to be in the same realm as The Rocky Horror Picture Show. If there is such a genre as ""atypic psychosexual horror musical,"" both films would fall into that category. Forbidden Zone is a collection of shocking oddities, catchy tunes, and eccentric characters all dumped into patchwork sets and spontaneous musical song and dance sequences. Needless to say, you have to know what you're getting into before giving this film a shot.

Huckleberry Jones, a local pimp, narcotics dealer and slum lord stumbles upon a door in his basement that leads to the sixth dimension - the Forbidden Zone - where King Fausto (Herv Villechaize) and his jealous queen Doris (Susan Tyrrell) rule over an assortment of lunatic minions.

The Hercules family buys the uncanny house and soon curious daughter Frenchy (Marie Pascale-Elfman) wanders into the Forbidden Zone, only to become a prisoner and fancy for the disloyal king. The queen learns of his infatuation with the new concubine and arranges her death - so it's up to Frenchy's family to rescue her. Her brother Flash is a reasoning yet easily sidetracked man-child, Gramps is a speechless, overweight clog that has to be tied down to the dinner table, and Pa is a tar pit worker who no longer values life. Aside from Frenchy's doltish family, abused chicken boy Squeezit also decides to come to her aid.

Forbidden Zone is a movie that must be watched with an open mind, or a hankering for the most bizarre characters and events fused with song and dance ever to jolt the big screen. A frog-headed servant (literally), excessive use of bright colored makeup, drugs, machineguns, blood, transvestites, blackface, talking chickens, constant nudity, a human chandelier, and random aberrant sexual activities comprise this outrageous film. Prisoners in Cell 63 are forced to wear Mickey Mouse hats, composer Danny Elfman makes an appearance as Satan, heads are lopped off, ears are sliced off in Reservoir Dogs fashion, and the Princess is always half-naked. ""Weird"" can't possibly cover all of the peculiarities that frequent the sixth dimension.

Spontaneous dance routines, unruly sound effects, lip-synching, stop motion animation with live action characters, superimposition, fast paced music, traditional animation and painted backgrounds are standard methods of storytelling in Forbidden Zone. Oftentimes the film is so abnormal that it's hilarious, but most of the time it's just plain crass. If you can make it through the opening scene, in which Gramps unexpectedly vomits into the lap of Flash, it's safe to say you'll be prepared for the appalling singularities that follow.

2103157,5,B0002LE9QS,"It's a good day when ""Forbidden Zone"" gets a DVD release!  Better yet, this is a valuable addition to the Fantoma disc, and not really a substitution.

I don't normally purchase or even watch colorized versions of black and white films, but Richard Elfman seemed to make a compelling case that he intended ""Forbidden Zone"" to be released in color.  I certainly do not begrudge the man for making a living, and he honors our pocketbooks by making the new release different enough to warrant a look.

In the color version, one notices details that aren't as readily apparent as in the original black and white version.  The sets seem to be made of cardboard and butcher block paper - that is clear in the original version, but is blazingly obvious in the colorized version.

Colorization aside, how is this version different?  This DVD is lacking the commentary of the original release, the documentary and the isolated score (this is bad.)  On the plus side, the new DVD has a DTS 5.1 track, and a promo for a Japanese audience.  However, the deal-maker is the pop-up trivia - that is truly interesting although somewhat redundant of the previous DVD director's commentary.

The colorization is quite good (who knew French's bathrobe was yellow), and adds to the surreal quality of the picture instead of being a distraction.

I don't normally like double DVD releases, but in this case I will make a strong exception.  Recommended!",1216857600,17,1431,4.819672131147541
2103158,5,B0002LE9QS,"This movie has been described as bizarre, racist, sexist and pornographic, and there is a reason for all of that - it is based on cartoons and movies from the early, pre-Hayes Act, 1930s when such features were commonplace. The most obvious connections, of course, are to the old music, lip-synced to performances by Cab Calloway, Josephine Baker, and the Gilt Edged Four (Yiddisher Charleston), to name a few. In the early Betty Boop cartoons, Max Fleischer experimented around with a form of cartoon lip- (and body-)syncing, in which cartoon characters were drawn over actual film footage of performers such as Cab Calloway, a process called ""rotoscoping."" You can see this in such Betty Boop cartoons as ""Minnie the Moocher,"" ""Old Man of the Mountain,"" and ""Betty Boop's Bamboo Isle."" Also, the Fleischer brothers were the first animators to concentrate on making accurate mouth movements to coordinate with speech in their cartoons. The Elfman Brothers do the same thing, with live action instead of rotoscoping. The Elfman brothers have generally adopted the mood and many of the visuals from the Betty Boop cartoon ""Bimbo's Initiation,"" one of the most bizarre cartoons ever made. In particular, the scene where characters have to select one of three doors comes straight out of this cartoon. The peculiar frog, the strange people, the cruel queen, the hideous children, the gruesome teacher, all have their parallels in the old cartoons. The weird old grandfather, a horny, mumbling, bearded fellow, is another early Betty-Boop stand-by. See, for example, the cartoon ""Mask-A-Raid."" Betty Boop spends a great deal of her pre-Hayes cartoon time being pawed by males. Sometimes this attention is welcome and sometimes not. The Elfman Brothers carry this behavior to an amusing extreme, but it is just an exaggeration of what is already in these cartoons.  In the Betty Boop cartoons, one gets to see a lot of glimpses and hints of the nude Betty (see, for reference, ""Red Hot Mamma."") Again, this is exaggerated for humorous effect by the Elfman brothers. The racism, too, is a take-off of the over-the-top stereotyping typical of cartoons of the 1930s. See, for example, the Betty Boop cartoon, ""I'll Be Glad When You're Dead,"" in which Louis Armstrong is animated as an African cannibal. As for the ""anti-Semitism,"" that is a tip of the hat to the genre of Yiddish humor and to the Jewish Fleischer brothers from the Jewish Elfman brothers. Another homage by the Elfman Brothers can be found in the name of Squeezit. This comes from an old Cary Grant movie called ""When You're In Love,"" in which there is a dog named Squeezit. In this movie, Grace Moore (an opera singer) sings ""Minnie the Moocher."" Hence, ""Squeezit the Moocher."" For the hell scene, again refer to ""Red Hot Mamma,"" in which Betty Boop visits hell and meets Satan.",1216512000,10,2838,4.987341772151899
2103159,5,B0002LE9QS,"The Forbidden Zone is a fabulous journey. The best way to describe it would be like falling into a Max Fleischer cartoon from the 1930's and hallucinating on the various edibles from Alice in Wonderland, set to some amazing music ranging from Cab Calloway and Josephine Baker to Oingo Boingo. This movie is fun. It frolics and pulls you in with the strange characters. Even the villains are extremely lovable.

My favorite part of this movie is the amazing Susan Tyrrell. She is a real Hollywood oddity. She did this movie just after being nominated for an Academy Award. The chemistry between Tyrrell and her then boyfriend, Herve Villachaize, is so sweet. Plus, she wrote the song ""Witch's Egg"" which she sings the heck out of. And don't miss the great performance by Danny Elfman as ""Satan""!

This movie is not for the mainstream, close minded person. It is odd and out there and wonderful. I reccommend it for the daring person who enjoys an occasional journey to another dimension.",1211846400,4,986,4.794117647058823
2103160,4,B0002LE9QS,"It's fairly easy to describe the plot to Forbidden Zone in general terms:  The Hercules family have a portal in their basement to the Sixth Dimension, and daughter, Frenchy, falls through.  She becomes the object of obsession for the king of the Sixth Dimension, Fausto.  Frenchy's brother and uncle come to the Sixth Dimension to rescue her.  That's the plot in a very general way, but what's not so easy is trying to describe practically anything else about the movie.  It's such a constant bombardment of bizarre and zany characters and situations that it makes my head hurt just thinking of how to begin to describe it all.  You remember those old cartoons from the 30s like Betty Boop or Bosco?  Any of those old cartoons that feature a cast of odd characters doing musical numbers and a bunch of other nonsensical stuff?  Forbidden Zone is like an R rated live action version of one of those cartoons.  Folks have compared it to Eraserhead, and I suppose that's fair to a certain degree considering both are bizarre and in B&W, but that's where all comparisons end.  It's really nothing like Eraserhead, maybe Eraserhead by way of Terry Gilliam at his craziest.  The movie was directed by Richard Elfman and includes more or less the whole Mystic Knights of Oingo Boingo(a musical theater group that would evolve into the rock band, Oingo Boingo)  as writers and performers.  The songs were done by Danny Elfman and Danny turnes up himself in a small role as the Devil where he does a great job singing a Cab Calloway tune.

2103175,4,B0002LE9QS,"This is an amazing and surreal comic musical nightmare from the 1980's, and is like no other film I have ever seen. The film, brainchild of Richard Elfman, with music by his better known brother, Danny, is essentially a screen version of what the Elfman brothers and their cohorts were presenting onstage as ""The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo,"" in the late 1970's: the film ensures the lunacy is preserved for posterity.

The film is very stream-of-consciousness, and extremely avant-garde. It features minimalist sets, extensive animation, is in black and white, and is designed around various musical numbers. All of these combine in an otherworldly manner to make the film a bizarre spectacle, which earns four stars purely for creativity and weirdness. It's kind of like if John Waters had directed ""Can't Stop The Music.""

The plot concerns the Hercules family and their trials in the sixth dimension. Daughter Susan B. ""Frenchy"" Hercules finds herself entering the sixth dimension (via a creatively presented digestive tract) where King Fausto (Herv Villechaize) falls in love with her, which angers Queen Doris substantially; this ultimately causes her to be imprisoned in a cell where all the prisoners wear Mickey Mouse ears. Grampa and Flash Hercules twist through the entrails to search for Frenchy, and pandemonium more or less ensues for the duration of the film. I was especially amused by Bust Rod, the servant frog (the Queen's right-hand amphibian), the human chandelier, and the Squeezit angel head (I won't even try to explain). I was less amused by the need for Gramps and Flash (among others) to more or less constantly attempt procreation. The catfight at the end is quite dynamic, and according to the commentary, partially real. Elfman had a limited budget, and costumes were primitive. The net result is that a lot of people appear only in undergarments. That's visually delightful in some cases, like the Princess (Gisele Lindley), while in other cases, like Gramps and Flash, is less appealing.

There are other things going on throughout the film, some of which I'm a bit unclear on even after watching the film with the commentary. I greatly enjoyed co-writer Matthew Bright (credited as Toshiro Baloney) in the dual role of Squeezit and Renee Henderson; and especially enjoyed the ""Chicken Boy"" scene in which a chicken speaks to him and becomes his muse. I was also fond of the duality of the roles of Huckleberry P. Jones and Pa, both played by Ugh-Fudge Bwana (Gene Cunningham). Perhaps most of all I enjoyed the schoolhouse scene in which members of the class learn the alphabet musically.

The DVD features many extras. The commentary track with Richard Elfman and Matthew Bright is amusing and enlightening. There are also deleted scenes and an interesting documentary on the making of the film which features many clips of ""The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo"" from their stage show. Real devotees may remember them from their unbelievable appearance on the Gong Show. Chuck Barris gave them this memorable and accurate introduction: ""We bring you an act who at first may shock you; but once you get to know them, they'll just boggle your mind."" After watching this movie, I can't think of a better summary.",1193616000,5,3252,5.0278293135436

2103177,4,B0002LE9QS,"Forbidden Zone looks like it had a budget of a few hundred dollars.  When I first saw it, it reminded me of madcap after hours programming you'd find on public access - a bunch of college kids seeing what wacky things they can do in front of the camera.

A closer look, however, reveals that all involved are quite talented - even if what appears on film is bizarre, vulgar, and some of it downright offensive.  But it's an historic relic of where Danny Elfman and Oingo Boingo had their beginnings.  Furthermore, as a built in midnight movie, it seems to be one of the last of its kind - attempting to entertain and shock with every piece of bizarre imagery they can throw at you with absolutely no consideration for box office receipts or whether the critics would like it or not.  It's a midnight movie from start to finish.  From its birth, it was a cult film.

As to the quality of this film, it's always a weird watch.  There's a guy in a frog suit, Danny Elfman playing Satan, a woman half naked throughout the film, and Tatoo himself, Herve Villachaize.  The story is really unimportant, but it involves the Hercules family being sucked into the sixth dimension.  Really its a springboard for the theatrics of the Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo, the theatrical troupe that was the starting point for Danny Elfman's career.  There's a lot of music in the film, of course, supplied by Danny.  It's a mix of Cab Calloway inspired music of the past, a tiny bit of new wave in the theme song, and weird theatrical music throughout that hinted at Elfman's future career.  It's enjoyable but like the film - it's manic.  The film and soundtrack pack so much in that it's hard to pick out one theme or characteristic to describe it.  Strange fun chaos is the best I can muster up.

The DVD itself provides a wealth for fans of both Elfmans, featuring deleted scenes, including an extended musical sequence, the video for Private Life, and an entertaining documentary where Richard Elfman interviews those involved with the film, including his more famous brother.  Entertaining as it is, Richard Elfman seems a little uneasy as emcee.  Still the wealth of goodies he gives us is great.  Throughout, we get to see unearthed footage of the Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo.  This is a top notch DVD for what is one of the weirdest madcap films that is probably responsible for giving us one of the greatest film composers and oh so much more.",1188691200,2,2446,4.5793103448275865

For those of you who have seen the movie before, it is certainly worth buying a digital quality copy of a black and white movie.  The picture is a little enhanced, but the music is GREATLY enhanced and sounds awesome.  The documentary explains a lot about the movie's roots in The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo and shows lots of footage from tMKotOB shows.  The commentary by Richard Elfman and Matthew ""Squeezit"" Bright was fitting in that it is nothing like typical movie commentary.  It includes such comments like ""How embarassed were you?"" and ""I SO wanted to #@$% her!""

For those of you who never watched this, let me sum it up.  I never took illicit drugs in my life.  Having watched The Forbidden Zone, I won't have to.  This chaotic and bizarre trip to the Sixth Dimension is beyond belief.  To give away the plot or suggest there WAS one would cheapen the experience.  Like true art, everyone experiences something a little different. In the conventional sense, this movie was a cinematic abomination: incredibly cheap sets, terrible wardrobe, cheesy acting.  But the net impact of the collective imaginations involved and the GREAT music is something you have to experience at least once.  This is also the first movie Danny Elfman did music for.  You will hear why he went on to do music for so many films.

It is certainly for late teens or adults only with nudity, simulated sexual acts and violence.  There are some scenes that could be considered racist, but one of the filmmakers is Jewish and grew up in urban Los Angeles.  The racial jokes are about people he knew most and grew up with first-hand experience.

So if you want to see a good movie, go get Shawshank Redemption.  If you want a unique multimedia experience that'll stimulate your imagination and leave you dancing and rolling on the couch with laughter, you need a trip to the Forbidden Zone.",1176854400,6,2101,4.685792349726776

2103203,5,B0002LE9QS,"The Elfmans really outdid themselves with this wonderfully weird nascent-Boingo {introduced as 'The Mystic Knights of The Oingo Boingo' at the time} film about members of a stereotypical Jewish family who go searching for their sister ""Frenchy"" {Marie-Pascale Elfman, Richard Elfman's wife} into the Sixth Dimension via a mysterious door opening up in the basement of their home, displaying a hellmouth entrance through which one must travel down an intestinal tract finally exiting the other end...

Little King Fausto {played by Herve Villachaize of Fantasy Island fame} falls in lust with Frenchy to the jealous ire of Evil Queen Doris {Susan Tyrrell}, who was hatched from a ""witch's egg"" {great song, by the way}, and sets out to torture the combativaly-resistant girl. She realizes this infatuation when Fausto moans her name after intimacy. Chained to a rack, the session ends with a glowing rod inserted in a spot best left to the imagination. I thought it amusing contemplating the suspended human chandelier grasping two candles, which retains its skeletal arousal even after excarnation!

Grampa and Flash Hercules go searching down the twisting entrails to the 6th dimension to find Frenchy and come upon an old Yiddish man operating an information stand exchanging sheckles for clues. Oi Vey! Along the way, they enact dorsal coitus with every female they see, until the criminally-insane Rasputin-lookalike Grampa Hercules wrestles a gorilla to an overkill.

High weirdness typifies ""Bim Bam Boom"" in which two singing boxers are joined by a strange doughy crooner in a Spanish diddy, about ""dark girls in the sun"" while wearing, of all things, a Mickey Mouse hat. Bust Rod The Frog joins in dancing with Frenchy... wow...

Amusing scenes include a school house rendition of The Three Stooges' ""Swinging the Alphabet"" {from 'Violent Is The Word For Curly', circa 1938 c.e.} with various students' performances including The Kipper Kids {as two Heidi-like characters}, Squeezit {gay ""Chicken boy"" who flaps his bended arms like wings}, a troupe of pimpish negro dancers {who perform, among other things, the ""robot"", ""locking"",  and ""break dancing""}, and a older Jewish gentleman in a propeller hat.

Most notable is ""Red Wolf"" Danny Elfman as a white-clad Devil performing a modified 'Minnie The Moocher' while striking a deal with Squeezit for sexual gratification with The Princess {Gisele Lindley}. Squeezit is captured by 'Bust Rod' the servant Frog and turned over to The Devil's black robed and faced Minions. On the way to Hades, one of them informs Squeezit ""The Master's been dying to stick his pitchfork in that there tomato!"", referring to The Princess. He delivers, and saves his friends from certain doom, at the cost of his head, which then begins flying around on angel wings.

Another memorable scene includes the song ""Pico and Sepulveda"" {performed by Felix Figueroa and his Orchestra, which this writer recalls being played on The Dr. Demento Show a few times}, which is a sarcastic tribute to that Los Angeles intersection, featuring gridlock and pumping smoke stacks with trapezoid towers.

The former queen comes back for revenge and does battle with Queen Doris, who employs a very surprising distraction, landing the ex-queen, and eventually herself, impaled at the bottom of The Pit. The film concludes with a cast closing number featuring all the delightfully odd characters in a rousing finale.

With avant-garde sets, demented dialogue, hilariously unorthodox loony tunes, playing on stereotypes, dare take an exciting journey into the fun comedic insanity of The Forbidden Zone.

The 1920's style jazz music and the addition of other music by Danny Elfman is fantastic.
 Matthew Bright (co-star & co-writer) steals the show in his dual roles of Sqeezit and Renee Henderson,  without a doubt the strangest characters in the flick.
  The weakest link in the film was Viva who portrayed the ex-queen of the Forbidden zone. Her performance was weak and lifeless compared to Susan Tyrrell's viscious energetic performance.

I saw this B/W classic for the first time in a 1984 university film class.  The prof warned us that it was racist, misogynistic, anti-Semitic, violent, vulgar and scatological (her words).  And she was and remains exactly right.  I sat through the 73-odd minutes of this thing (shown on film, no less), and when it was over I wasn't quite sure what I'd seen.  I remember a strange and heavy feeling of dread and confusion that hung with me for a few days, like I'd seen something deeply disturbing but couldn't yet make sense of it.  But I'd also laughed, hard, at a number of the scenes in the film.

It wasn't until a good ten years later I got my hands on a bootleg VHS copy, and I bought my own copy (signed!) from the Richard Elfman web site two years ago.  It was only on second and subsequent viewings that I figured out exactly what the story was, and then really started to see the subtlety of the film, to appreciate and enjoy it more.

It opens in the kitchen at breakfast, with the family in intentionally awful stage makeup, sitting in mismatched chairs on a set with ultra low-budge hand-painted elementary school play backdrops.  The psychotic mom gets knocked cold by dad when she talks too much.  Then they have to tie up Grandpa before the kids go to school.  And that's in the first couple of minutes.

Then school, where the scenes are pure nightmare, just chaos, with the grotesque images of the teacher and students, hideous caricatures of kids that I knew, and you'll recognize as well.  Then in the middle of this highly disorienting scene comes the ""Alphabet Song/Swinging the Alphabet,"" with the ""F"" and ""G"" verses corrupted thoroughly and hilariously.

Then we descend to the underworld and by way of introduction to the Sixth Dimension, watch two guys in jock straps sing a goofy song in a boxing ring, followed by a frog-headed guy doing some soft-shoe, and a seriously creepy version of ""Bim Bam Boom.""

The crass racial and ethnic stereotypes flit in and out, amateurish, really, in their insertion, and having little relation to the movie itself.  Right at the beginning there's a black-face guy, described as local pimp Huckleberry P. Jones, with his bad suit and boxing gloves, no less.  The Hercules patriarch has a horribly dubbed Yiddish accent, and we even run across Jewish money lenders down in the Sixth Dimension.  I don't really get their placement or function in the film, other than visual distraction, or misfiring attempts at comedy.

And some violence.  A guy gets shot at school, although it's pantomime-corny.  There is some serious fisticuffs, but it's also hammy.  A knife goes right through a thigh, but it's a cheezy effect.  But when Grandpa Hercules fights the gorilla he ends up literally bashing its head into ground meat, and that's a pretty disturbing close-up, even in B/W.  The queen gets shot, somewhat graphically, with a little bit of blood.  The two queens end up at the bottom of the pit, their bodies run through with steel blades.  And Squeezit loses his head, although he doesn't really die, and the head even sprouts wings to flit around as a cheezy Sixth Dimension mascot.

And some nudity.  The excruciatingly nubile Princess wears nothing but tight high-rise briefs, pumps, and gloves for the entire film.  There's a wacky kind of topless cattle drive of young ladies, comical and erotic in its own strange way.  There's a lot of comically strange/strangely comical frottage going on, mostly Flash and Gramps grabbing various Sixth Dimension denizens.  Nothing graphic at all, but the MPAA would call it sexual content.

And fun with trivia:  1)  Uber-nerds will recognize the Forbidden Zone theme as that from the short-lived&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dilbert/dp/B0000WN15E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dilbert</a>&nbsp;TV show from a few years back; 2) Music nerds also will recognize an original recording of ""Pico and Sepulveda,"" which was for many decades the backing/theme song of the Doctor Demento radio show (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Very-Best-of-Dr-Demento/dp/B000056W0C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Very Best of Dr. Demento</a>).

Lastly, get that soundtrack (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Forbidden-Zone/dp/B0000014RL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Forbidden Zone</a>).  If you like a good mix of music, you'll love the CD.  If you're expecting raw Oingo Boingo, you'll be disappointed.  Sure, they're there, but not in the kind of depth and orchestration you're probably looking for.  There's a couple old-timey tunes (""Bim Bam Boom,"" ""Some of These Days""), lots of Danny Elfman's original score, and the sorrowfully too-short ""Squeezit The Moocher.""  For whatever sad reason, ""Pico and Sepulveda"" is not included in this release.

Bottom line:  This is just one of those cult films you have to be able to say you've seen.  If you're looking for slick production and deep, deep artistic symbolism and staging, you'll be hugely disappointed.  You may not like it at first, it being more confusing than anything, but if you've got an open mind and tend toward black humor, and if you watch it more than once, you'll enjoy it.  If you're looking for something seriously off the wall, a film like none other you've ever seen, then this is the one you've been waiting for.",1138838400,70,6957,5.906
2103208,4,B0002LE9QS,"You've probably already noticed that I've given this film four-out-of-five-stars. But for a film like Richard Elfman's ""Forbidden Zone,"" a ranking doesn't quite apply; this experimental black and white musical/comedy so blatantly offbeat and bizarre that any level of verification would be pointless and subtracting. Elfman's use of abstract, kooky, German Expressionist-type imagery made it obvious that this was something he wanted to have stand alone, free from traditional methods of filmmaking. If this was, in fact, his intention, then it worked. It certainly succeeded in being an original film. (I ask you: how often have you envisioned a cross-dimensional journey through a set of intestines? Or a dancing frog butler?)

But being original also made for a rather jarring experience. This movie isn't afraid to revel in its quirkiness, and if you're not prepared for it--or at the very least not open to it--then you'll only come away feeling confused, angry, disgusted, or any combination of the three. Conventional moviegoer mentalities need to be put aside if one hopes to be entertained. An affinity for Oingo Boingo doesn't hurt, either.

Just try to imagine this: the basement in the home of the Hercules Family has a secret door that leads to the Sixth Dimension. Frenchy, the daughter (Marie-Pascale Elfman), is warned never to go near it; this is because her classmate's brother (or possibly sister) has already gone through and disappeared! But as sure as the sky is blue, she gets a little too curious for her own good and takes a peek behind the door. A cartoonish descent (through the aforementioned intestines) into the Sixth Dimension follows, culminating in Frenchy's expulsion from ... well, let's just say the non-oral end of the digestive tract. Her arrival heightens the interest of King Fausto (Herv Villechaize), who can't seem to keep his lustful eyes off of her despite his depraved ownership of topless concubines. Would it surprise you to learn that the two fall in love anyway?

Frenchy also manages to get the attention of Queen Doris (Susan Tyrrell), Fausto's authoritarian wife. Along with various moments of explicit sexuality, a cameo by composer Danny Elfman as Satan, and the attempt to rescue Frenchy in the midst of unabashed wackiness, the rest of the film deals with the Queen's rapid decent into jealousy and how she makes destroying Frenchy her top priority.

It may be an overly strange attempt at a plot, but it's a plot nonetheless. It's the final ingredient in this cinematic stew, and it's just quirky enough to satisfy even the most seasoned cult film fanatic.

This would no doubt be a horrendous film if it were analyzed through a conventional filter. But as I said earlier, conventional doesn't even come into play here; how can it when Elfman's interpretation of the ""real"" world is just as twisted as his vision for the Sixth Dimension? The two worlds might as well have been one and the same, considering some slight scenery changes were the only things indicating a difference. Thank God Elfman quickly reverted to a catchy musical number to distract me from this problem.

It's a quick-and-dirty film, and one would certainly expect it to be loaded with inconsistencies, goofs, and oddball attempts at cohesion. ""Forbidden Zone"" certainly delivers in this area, even if they weren't intentionally created. For one, why is Father Hercules thirty to forty years younger than his own son? Furthermore, why was Satan included when he didn't really add anything to the movie (other than singing a twisted version of Cab Calloway's ""Minnie the Moocher"")? Why did it have to be so unnecessarily sexual? And what in God's name was the deal with Squeezit Henderson (also known as Chicken Boy)? I'm well aware of how irrelevant these questions are, but I really can't help asking them. I guess I'm too used to straightforward plotlines and traditional character studies to let such things go.

Still, I have to admit that I was entertained by this movie. Of course, that didn't prevent me from thinking, ""What the hell did I just watch?"" by the time the end credits started to roll. The fact that this made it into theaters alone is beyond me; the target audience is so limited that it would be a miracle if it managed to break even. Then again, financial success may not have been that elusive. One look at the cardboard sets and student-film-quality camera tricks gave me a rough budget estimate of, oh, three hundred dollars (with maybe an extra dollar added for the black marker; they needed something to draw doors and windows with). The production design amounts to nothing more than a cheaply produced high school play, a quality that was both fascinating and annoying. Was there really nothing else to work with, even on a shoestring budget?

I'm sure those of you reading this don't know how to take this review. Is ""Forbidden Zone"" a good film or a bad film? I don't think I can answer that, despite my four star rating. Maybe that's because this isn't exactly a movie; it's more of an experience, one that demands at least one viewing. Its willingness to be different was both refreshing and repulsive, which is probably why I was unable to turn away from it. If I may be allowed an overused simile, it was like watching a train wreck. But what a disturbingly glorious train wreck it was.",1136073600,6,5351,4.918050941306755
2103209,4,B0002LE9QS,"Danny Elfman's outlandish 1980 film ""Forbidden Zone"" has to be seen to be believed, and if you are not at least slightly demented you should probably pass on the seeing part. Imagine a cross between ""Alice in Wonderland"" and ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"", with lots of animation in the style Monty Python's Flying Circus and the rubbery Max Fleischer cartoons of the 1930's (which probably inspired much of the original Monty Python stuff anyway). Also deserving mention is the fact that this relatively low budget black and white film is a musical.

There are a lot of characters and the story is somewhat hard to follow so here is what I hope is a helpful summary. The Hercules family (father, mother, son, daughter, and grandfather) live in a house with a door to the Sixth Dimension a/k/a The Forbidden Zone (think Wonderland). Their daughter Frenchy (think Alice) and son Flash (who looks like third stooge Joe Besser in a cub scout uniform) go to school one day. When a gunfight erupts in the classroom Frenchy runs home.

Tripping on a roller skate she tumbles through the door into a large intestine and ends up in the sixth dimension, which is ruled by a King and Queen of dice-used instead of playing cards. There are a lot of half-dressed wonderland type characters down there although only the Frog Footman looks the same. There is a shapely princess who runs around topless, a living chandelier that eventually decays into just a skeleton, a devil (played by Elfman) who is like Cab Calloway playing the Cheshire Cat, and a rival queen.

Frenchy's family and one of her classmates go into the Forbidden Zone to attempt a rescue. The film is a mix of live action and animation. The editor deserves a lot of credit because the whole thing is sequenced quite well and even has a strange unity. There are racist stereotypes (generally too silly to be offensive), lively swing music, and sets that look to have been painted and constructed by a third grade art class.

2103211,4,B0002LE9QS,"Five years after 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show,' (1975) brothers Danny and Richard Elfman made this cult film, partly in order to record on screen the performance of Oingo Boingo (then called Mystic Knights of the Oingo-Boingo).  The results became 'Forbidden Zone' this crazy, but strangely attrative no-budget musical.

The film is about the king and the queen of the World of the Sixth Dimention, where insanity and craziness rule.  Susan Tyrrell is the jealous Queen Doris with a beehive hair; Herv Villechaize ('Nick Nack' in 'The Man with a Golden Gun' beside Christopher Lee) is the King Fausto.  There is a butler with a frog's head.  There is a French girl named Frenchy (played by Marie-Pascale Elfman, then married to Richard Elfman) who unwisely strays into the underworld.  And Danny Elfman himself appears as The Satan, who sings a spoof song of Cab Calloway.  In other words, no one makes a film like this today.

To me, the most impressive part is its songs (largely based on old 30s-type numbers) plus Oingo Boingo's own numbers, and the animation in the vein of Max Fleischer cartoons.  If you find the rest of the film too ugly for your taste, you will admit that these parts are curiously attractive, like the score of Danny Elfman who is to be more famous with his works in 'Batman.'

Some parts of the film might no longer appeal to us as they did in the 80s.  The intentionally stereotyped characters (black people in the classroom, for example) are not surprising today, but within the context of the political correctness in the 80s, we can easily imagine that they were surprsing, and shocking, to some then.  Interestingly, Matthew Bright (then credited as Toshiro Baloni) contributed to the zany screenplay, and Bright himself is to make films with different taste like 'Freeway' of which music is by Danny Elfman again.

Shot in black and white, and made with painted cardboards as backdrops, 'Forbidden Zone' has been a favorite choice for cult film fans.  Looking back from now, the film's uneven quality cannot be denied, but for some of the deliciously odd moments, 'Forbidden Zone' attracted, and will attract many cult film fans forever.",1125273600,6,2173,4.885558583106267

2103223,5,B0002LE9QS,"Forbidden Zone could be the most eye-openingly bizarre film ever made, surpassing even Eraserhead.  The fact that it is cheaply made and often inept is most definitely an asset - in a world this surreal conventional filmmaking techniques would seem out of place.  In any case, there is no question that anyone interested in underground movies needs to purchase this.  Its dismissal by critics and its unpopularity have both been unfair hamperings on its reputation.  In actuality, its artistic vision is as singular and imaginative as Eraserhead's, or any cult classic for that matter.  Rarely has cardboard been the vehicle for such a visionary production design.

There is so much to take note of - but I would single out the 'Bim bam boom' musical number with the mumbling boxers, the inexplicable antics in the classroom, and Danny Elfman's totally suave appearance as Satan towards the end as truly classic moments in the world of cult movies.  They manage to be disturbingly surreal and amusingly silly and cartoonish at the same time.

If Rocky Horror was the ""Citizen Kane"" of the Midnight Movie, Forbidden Zone is more of a ""Ben Hur"": an epic you have to watch it entirely through to believe it.

The blend of b-movie camp, Max Fleischer surrealism, Cab Calloway and Jazz Era excess collide with a plot that's probably best left unsaid. Yes, there are plenty of borderline offensive jokes and archetypes that run from anti-pc outrage to cliche back to outrage again, but the punk rock schlock aesthetic that the Elfman brother's had tapped into in the 1980's is as cutting edge then as it was 25 years ago.

What was most suprising were the additional features - you found out the background of the ""Mystic Knights"" and how talented and energetic the theater troupe that had formed the basis for the film was (many of the characters in the movie were part of a Theater Troupe that would later become Oingo Boingo, Danny Elfman included).

2103225,5,B0002LE9QS,"Well maybe cult film doesn't quite cover it. This movie is so unique!

A few nights ago I was watching the Marx Bros. Cocoanuts followed by some Blackhawk items from the Slapstick Encyclopedia (Recommended!!) and the origins of much of this utterly wacked film were obvious. Forbidden Zone is adult, totally filthy at times, and very over-the-top but in many ways it's a loving tribute to a lot of old films, cartoons, Yiddish theater, Cab Calloway, and other charming things from the past. The character of Froggie is based on a 50s children's TV show character, for example.

It can be edgy and uncomfortable (not in a bad way!) but it's largely a heck of a lot of fun. The musical numbers--often characters lip-synching to great old tunes--are another memorable aspect to this film. The cast is fantastic. For a bottom-of-the-barrel budget movie the overall look and feel is spectacular and there are surprisingly few awkward moments.

I've seen a lot of underground movies, especially from this era, and I'd say, although many are good to great this is the only one that shows genuine genius. I often lose track of the amazing number of truly original and unforgettable moments in this film.

STERN WARNING! This film is not for pink-cheeked youngsters who are Politically Correct.

This movie is full of them for exactly that reason. It's called ""irony""--look it up in the dictionary if you haven't already burned your copy because it contains words you don't like. The younger generations can be pretty humorless and incapable of understanding what I'm writing about and that's exactly why many of you kittens remind us old-timers of the miserable, narrow-minded, hung-up, fascists we were fighting way back then.

This movie isn't for everyone.  There are so many people who aren't turned onto something this strange.  But, you never know. ;)",1095897600,3,573,5.053763440860215
2103244,5,B0002LE9QS,"My first copy was also defective, but I saw on the Fantoma website that they were aware of the problem with a small batch of the discs and I received a new copy in less than a week and it works fine. Cheers for great customer service!

""Five stars"" if you like this type of movie. It's definitely not for everyone. If you love old black-and-white cartoons and unusual music you'll love it, as long as you can get past some violence and childish humor. (I seemed to notice that less 20 years ago!) The new 5.1 mix is a lot of fun. Much of the vintage music on the soundtrack is confined to the center speaker, but Danny Elfman's score and the sound effects really show off the surrounds.

The documentary was interesting, but after being patient to see it due to the original disc's defect, I wished there had been a bit more to the documentary. You get some additional info from the commentary track. There was also a good selection of deleted scenes, including a long routine by the Kipper Kids.",1095206400,4,996,4.407608695652174
2103245,5,B0002LE9QS,"First off, the copy I rented was defective.  The movie played fine but the special features are inaccessible.  That's a shame, because I would love to see the documentary.  So, while I appreciate Fantoma releasing this impressive cult classic on DVD, I am somewhat disappointed with the actual product and more than a little hesitant to purchase it.  I see where it was avered in another review that Amazon's copies are not defective.  I am crossing my fingers.

I was first intoduced to The Forbidden Zone by a friend who had rented it from Blockbuster and loved it so much he never returned it.  I watched it with a group of friends and we were all immediately amazed and enchanted.  I have owned a couple of copies on VHS and have worn them both out with repeated viewings.

The most striking thing about the movie is the brilliant expressionistic set design reminiscent of Weine's The Cabinet of Dr. Caligeri and, to a lesser degree, Charles Laughton's Night of the Hunter.  This marvelous scenic art is blended seamlessly with animation that only seems to expand the expressionist aesthetic of the film.

Then there is the wild, lurching plot-line, a perfect marriage of classic absurdism and Sci-fi B-movie exploitation:  There is a door to the sixth dimension in the basement of the Hercules abode.  One day, Frenchy Hercules, despite the warning of her father(given in the film's first astounding musical sequence,)decides to check it out.  She is taken prisoner by the King and Queen and put in cell 63, the cell where the King keeps his favorite concubines.  He has taken a fancy to Frenchy because of their shared nationality.  His infatuation has driven the Queen into a jealous rage.  Will Flash and Gramps Hercules find her before she exacts her revenge?  There are other zaney characters like Sqeezit the chicken boy and Bust Rod, the giant frog henchman of the Queen.

Danny Elfman's (Oingo Boingo) score is fantastic.  The musical numbers really shine.  He even makes an appearance in one of them as the Devil (cum Cab Calloway) himself!  Danny hamms it up nicely for his brother.

I cannot say enough good things about this peerless, visionary film.  If you have never seen it, it is worth the purchase even if the special features don't work.",1094947200,4,2261,4.812987012987013
2103246,5,B0002LE9QS,"This is a great movie so imagine my disappointment when my DVD player froze when trying to play any of the special features. Tried disc in a different dvd player - same trouble. As it happened, I bought two extra copies for gifts and both of these copies have same defect. Sad, sad, sad. My copies were shipped on September 9th, so the customer review of September 7 claiming that Amazon had no more bad copies is obviously misinformed. Amazon is replacing my defective copies - hopefully with ones that work as intended. I see at [...] that the maker of the dvd knows of this problem. Rating of zero for product quality. Movie is a 5 and special features if they work are probably right up there too!

UPDATE SEPTEMBER 18: The replacement copies Amazon quickly shipped work fine - at least the one I opened to watch does. The documentary, deleted scenes and such in the special features were quite enjoyable.",1094774400,3,909,4.576687116564417

buy this now. trust me, You will not regret it. This is a piece of cinematic history, and its your chance to own it.

2103248,5,B0002LE9QS,"This is without a doubt my favorite movie ever. I can guarantee you one thing, you have never seen a movie quite like Forbidden Zone.  From the cardboard cut-out scenery to the way over the top acting, to the just plain bizarre musical score, it is an experience not to be missed.",1094169600,3,280,4.384615384615385
2103249,4,B0002LE9QS,"I saw the Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo stage show several times in the later 1970s,  and saw Forbidden Zone when it was released.  These were distant but fond memories of high energy zaniness, and surprising creativity.  Incredible stuff.  Forbidden Zone videotape was released, renewing the fun for me and now this great DVD is released.  The added features on this DVD, particularly the documentary where Richard Elfman talks about the film and interviews other participants, are appreciated.  Clips from Mystic Knights stage performances are shown as well, which whets the appetite.  Richard, how about putting out some Mystic Knight shows on DVD!",1094083200,3,656,5.25
2103250,5,B0002LE9QS,"Finally, the wait is over.  The movie that Film Threat.com calls the ""Citizen Kane of Underground movies"" is coming to DVD.  No longer will you have to watch your worn-out illicit VHS copy given to you by a friend of a friend.

For the uninitiated, Forbidden Zone may be one of the most surreal and rock and roll movies ever made.  The plot involves a house inhabited by the Hercules family who discover a doorway that is a portal the Sixth Dimension.  Lording over the alternate-reality is King Fausto and his Queen , who's marital problems are worsened when Fausto sets his eye on wooing Frenchy Hercules a sexy girl who has accidentally come across the Forbidden Zone.

The aesthetics of the film are that of a Betty Boop short on acid.  Shot in black and white, all of the arty sets are made of cardboard.  The acting is cartoonishly stylized, with many of the older actors playing younger child-like characters.  Danny Elfman scores Forbidden Zone with the same frantic tenacity that he has exhibited throughout his entire career.  Also featured are musical numbers lip-synched to songs Danny has found from the bottom of the barrel of the thirties hot jazz era that is such an inspiration for the film.

I can't say that Forbidden Zone is for everyone.  It's bizarre narrative needs to be watched a few times to truly be followed.  It contains enough playfully tasteless jokes in it to offend almost everyone.  However one cannot deny its uniqueness and individuality.  For a truly creative, weird and unforgettable cinematic experience nothing surpasses Forbidden Zone.",1093392000,4,1576,4.87218045112782
2103251,5,B0002LE9QS,"This is an awesome find and collector's dream. The film, about a porthole to the Sixth Dimension and a most unusual family's discovery of it, is a bizarre low budget delight in b&w featuring original music by Oingo Boingo and vintage music by Cab Calloway and Miguelito Valdez. Another reviewer pretty much summed things up but I'd like to mention that if you're a fan of the late, great Susan Tyrrell, she's on fine display here. She plays the wicked Queen of the Sixth Dimension and sings a great song ""Witch's Egg"" which she also helped compose. Herve Villechaize is the King (""He's a little man but he carries a big stick""), Marie-Pascale Elfman, Viva, Toshiro Baloney and the Kipper Kids also star. This little gem is obviously not for everyone, but if you've never seen it it's worth a look. For fans of ""Forbidden Zone"" it's debut on DVD is a celebration. I've had the soundtrack on a Varese Sarabande CD for some time and my VHS tape is long gone. I'm truly looking forward to this release. Enjoy.",1090108800,13,1005,4.588888888888889
8028859,5,B0002LE9QS,"Watch the B&W version, it's way better than the color version.  I personally can never watch this movie again; I was so traumatised.

8028863,5,B0002LE9QS,"Perhaps one of the greatest movies produced in our time, even if it was like a 12 year old with great taste in music wrote it, and had to make all the props by himself.
It actually has one of the best performances of Herv Villechaize before his suicide.
There is a lot that *should* be offensive about Forbidden Zone, but its unique mixture of the surreal, the juvenile, and the clever, makes it hard to actually be offended.
Watching it in color was actually a little weird. I was used to the black and white version, and it's very obvious that a lot of the makeup work was done in homage to/parody of old b&w movies.
If you're streaming, let it play past the credits for extras. They're not amazing or anything, it's just not obvious they exist, it takes a while before they start.
If you have the DVD set, do go for the commentary sometime, there's some good stuff.",1504396800,,868,4.364197530864198

I ordered it as soon as I could, and the first DVD crashed on everything I played it on at the same exact timestamp.
Returned and exchanged, got a new one. Skipped to said timestamp, and it didn't do anything funky.
So I left it sit on my bookshelf until I was in the mood to watch again. Finally was in the mood, fired it up, and... at the exact same timestamp, it crashes hard. Again.

The B&W DVD works great, no problems in the same area or anything. But I guess the colored version of this film was cursed since production.",1497484800,,561,4.194444444444445
