2385617,4,B000ADS61M,"I agree-- These are fantastic cartoons and I love watching them with my 2 year old. However, I do want them restored with original voices and *un-cut*. I realize that these are different times, and I understand the reluctance to release the shorts with the racial jokes.

But the fact remains that these wonderful cartoons are a part of our culture and reflect a different time that wasn't perfect. The jokes are nothing that a child can't handle with a little guidance from a parent. I loved these cartoons as a kid, and the occasional ""off-color"" joke didn't warp me too badly! C'mon guys-- do it right!

The upcoming Vol. 3 Warner collection (Bugs, Daffy, etc.) is supposed to have a disclimer that some cartoons may be inappropriate for kids- and is a collection with adults in mind. Perfect!",1126915200,18,796,4.719424460431655

2385652,5,B000ADS61M,"Buy this if you love the classic Tom & Jerry.

I've purchased all 3 volumes of the Tom and Jerry Spotlight Collection as well as the Chuck Jones DVD.  That covers all of the episodes other than the Gene Deitch episodes and supposedly 2 or 3 others that are so racially charged that they have been censured from existence.

All are labeled as being for adults because some of the episodes contain smoking, drinking, and racism.  I contend that they were hilarious when I was a kid and still are.  Given that I didn't turn out to be a chain-smoking, alcoholic, member of the KKK, I can only assume that watching these episodes does not have that effect on children.  If you believe otherwise, please stick to the modern broadcasts or look elsewhere for entertainment.

At the time when we got these episodes my daughter was 4 or 5 years old and got very upset when anything bad happened to anyone in a cartoon.  Tom and Jerry was the perfect thing because they continually do mean things to each other and keep coming back for more.  There was no long term impact.  It could just be a funny cartoon.  In short, she quickly grew to love them and we've watched all of the episodes multiple times.  I think it helped me give her a grasp on what was real vs what was pretend and silly.  Your mileage may vary.  ...after all, your child could grow up to be a chain smoking alcoholic member of the KKK if exposed to this filth.",1423267200,3,1419,4.3869731800766285

2385659,5,B000ADS61M,"This Tom and Jerry volume two set had some very bad press because it had some edited cartoons when first released to DVD, but thankfully MGM issued a free replacement by calling their toll free number. Newer sets of the same release have the corrected disc intact, but if you happen to get an older stock set, you can have the corrected disc sent to you for free.

Now that the set has all unedited cartoons, lets talk about what we get on this volume two release. First, we get 38 cartoons spread out on the two discs, 20 on disc 1 and 18 on disc 2. The cartoons look very colorful and clear, but there are scratches present, so a full restoration wasn't done. It really doesn't matter all that much as the cartoons look very good! It's just a little disheartening that MGM didn't feel these classic shorts were worth the extra trouble. Although the Cinemascope shorts included on this set look fantastic! I found that the audio was inconsistent from short to short, but none of them sounded muffled, just that some shorts were louder than others.

I would like to address the complaints about the Whoopi Goldberg warnings, Please give me a break, if all I have to do is listen to a warning that is 30 seconds long, then I am fine with that, if you don't press menu skip and its all over. I just don't understand all the fuss, it's a new world and that is the way it is, so deal with it.

The Tom and Jerry cartoons on this set are very good, but I didn't like them as much as on the first volume. It is obvious that the animation and music are top notch and I still consider these shorts classic, but I must admit after seeing so many cat and mouse cartoons in a short period was a little tough as the theme is almost always the same.

The extras are a little thin on this set, but I suppose they ran out of material. I bought this set new for a little over $8.00 and it is one of the best bargains I've seen in a long time. I'm glad I waited until they corrected the errors and also reduced the price. For what you get here, it is a hard set to beat for fans of the famous duo!",1399593600,2,2080,4.153846153846154

Brings back memories of when i was little and watched them over and over.. Would always make me laugh.

I would have put 5 stars... BUT..

The only thing i didn't like was the commentary in the beginning from Whoopi Goldberg. I felt it was unnecessary.  Im 40 years old and grew up watching Tom & Jerry and never once did i ever thing it was racist.. And i doubt my 3 year old or any other small child would even think this.  :(  Was just unnecessary. was surprised to see this..",1383091200,,585,4.0964912280701755

There is something completely silly and wonderful about these cartoons - they are not political commentary.  I find it revolting that we are subjected to a monologue by Whoopi Goldberg on political correctness before being able to watch this.  The DVD also contains a warning that due to PC problem that the cartoons may not be suitable for children.  Who are they for then?  The cartoons get a 5 review - Whoopi and the warning reduce it TO A 2.

You can no longer use just the artwork as 100% proof you have a ""edited"" version as there is now a new release with the ""original"" artwork (Tom's head toward the top right as Jerry runs away with a wedge of cheese) that does have the unedited shorts. The way to determine if you have the corrected version with original artwork is to look for:

""All-New Introduction by Whoopi Goldberg""

As the very first ""Special Feature"" in the yellow ""Special Features"" box on the back of the package/box (you can see this on the Amazon art display).

If you've already opened your set you can look at the DVD creation time/date stamp on a computer with a DVD ROM drive.

TOM AND JERRY SPOTLIGHT COLLECTION: VOLUME 2 [DISC 2]
Edited: 9/13/05 - 3:22PM
Corrected: 12/8/05 - 5:39PM

Keep in mind that while the audio of the shorts has been restored the subtitles have been ""corrected"" for spelling and ""correct"" speech.  While it *would* have been nice for this to be restored to what is spoken on the audio as well, I've found that on *many* releases the subtitle and/or CC text does not match exactly what is being said anyway.

Disc one contains early material. You can tell because they have ""Mammy Two Shoes,"" the maid, in many of them at the beginning. She is a supporting character who's face we never see, and she was fazed out after a few years. The PC Police consider this to be racist, because she's black. A white maid, however, is okay with them. That's the typical Liberal double standard. They even change Mammy's grammar when you use the English subtitles!  Puh-leeze!'

Anyway, there is enough good material on here to enjoy this collection. These Tom and Jerry cartoons seem timeless. They were good 50 years ago, and still funny today.",1263772800,3,809,4.683098591549296

2385721,5,B000ADS61M,"For those individuals not too deep into collecting: Warner Home originally sent out this volume (#2) of their Tom and Jerry's Spotlight Collection with four of the shorts edited- quite contrary to the selling point of these volumes being released as being ""uncut"" and fully restored.

After a huge cry from the collector community at large, WH went back and re-released the volume- sans the aforementioned edits- back to their original theatrical versions. The affected shorts were ""The Lonesome Mouse"", ""Polka-Dot Puss"", ""Saturday Evening Puss"", and ""Nit-Witty Kitty""-- all changed in the 60's to remove the original voice talent of Lillian Randolph (aka ""Mammy Two Shoes"") and replace it with Chuck Jones' comrade June Foray, purely in a effort to tone down some of the racial stereotypes rampant throughout most of those originally-released shorts.

""Lonesome Mouse"", et al, are brought back to their non-PC hilarity in these corrected discs, although there are legitimate complaints of visual quality issues once these shorts were re-pressed within the other shorts on the discs not affected with edit problems. But to me, it was all worth the wait.

(As a last note: BEWARE!! I want to make sure that those who want to get the re-released, unedited version of Vol. 2, actually get their hands on the RIGHT one! On the cover face of the 'corrected' version, Tom's head is towards the bottom left of the cover, as he tries to swipe at Jerry; on most (if not, ALL) of the edited versions sold both on-line and in some dusty store bins, Tom's head is towards the top right of the cover face as Jerry escapes with a piece of cheese.

Accept Tom & Jerry for what they are, don't feel like you have to put racial disclaimers about images that play for 5 seconds in a film.  Kids do no notice it, it has no impact on them.

2385733,1,B000ADS61M,"As regards the editing and censorship of these and many other Tom and Jerry shorts, released by Warner Bros.:

""Racism"", as defined by Ayn Rand, ""is the notion of ascribing moral, social or political significance to a man's genetic lineage--the notion that a man's intellectual and characterological traits are produced and transmitted by his internal body chemistry.""

Tom and Jerry and the content of their respective animated history do not promote ""racism"" in any way, shape of form by this definition or any other that I know of. (although the editing of these cartoons surely does)

A black actress, Lillian Randolph, used her REAL voice for the so-called ""Mammy Two Shoes"" character. This was - yes - an actual black woman, somewhat parodizing the part of Academy Award winner Hattie McDaniel's role in Gone With The Wind. The ahem, offensive ""accent"" in question happens to be a true and accurate for many who lived in the southern US at that time, as well as (shockingly) today. Perhaps it frightens some closet racists who believe that just because Tom and Jerry's Mammy does not sound like a Harvard educated elite, that she is somehow less intelligent. A very dubious suggestion indeed.

Whether or not a black woman was or is a maid is irrelevant. There are and have been maids from every culture and group on earth. The fact that this has been considered an undesirable occupation is again irrelevant. (many live-in maids take the place of ""Mothers"" for millions of children worldwide as well as exposing them to new cultures & ideas).

Furthermore, in the cartoons themselves, Mammy is portrayed as a purposeful, aggressive, multi-tasking household manager (as maid or owner) as well as often being overtly depicted as a sex-object. This would not have been readily accepted on mainstream TV but many animators wanted to fight the idea that blacks shouldn't be portrayed as cool, sexy or smart and did so quite subversively through their own artistic medium.

As to Hattie McDaniel who received harsh criticism from the NAACP for her role as a maid in a number of features, she is quoted as saying, ""I'd rather play a maid and make $700 a week than be one for $7.""

In addition to the ""Maid-Racism"" issue, scenes featuring Tom or Jerry in Blackface harken back to an era where blacks could NOT appear in film in the main roles, so some enterprising actors like Al Jolson among others, used this thematic device to introduce White audiences to Jazz, ""black culture"", etc. thereby defying racial bigotry. Moreover, animation by its nature exaggerates everyone's features, ethnic, cultural or otherwise. Have a look at the Looney Tunes original version of ""Hollywood Steps Out"" for multiple examples of this. Is this racism? Hardly. It is a form of celebrating and poking fun at the unique, the rare, the odd and the true.

When I watched these cartoons as a young boy both in Canada (station was from Vermont) and on vacation in Florida, my impression of the ""Mammy"" character was that here was a woman that you did not push around. I was also moved and interested by the music in many of these shorts which was clearly part of the Jazz scene that I was not readily exposed to. And yes, I found that her chest was quite impressive, perhaps taking some of my attention away from Spider-Woman who I also had a major crush on.

Joseph Stalin, creator of the term ""Political Correctness"", used to remove the names, photos and lives of people he disliked from books, historical records, etc. (usually after killing them). I am very saddened to see Americans using the same ""social engineering"" techniques to create a false past for themselves and futher, to denigrate the true and accurate experiences of many men and women who struggled to succeed in what was once and still could be, the greatest country on earth. I say this as a Canadian and as a true believer in what the founding fathers attempted to create - a country based on individual liberty.

A final note: I believe that these cartoons should be released in their original, politically incorrect glory and while I love Whoopie Goldberg, we don't need her warnings to be able to enjoy these works - although I am happy to know that she's a fan too.",1203206400,27,4219,4.790921595598349

2385741,5,B000ADS61M,"I remember watching this classic trouble-making duo as a kid growing up and laughing my pants off. My father and I were huge fans of the original Tom and Jerry cartoons and we looked forward to watching these hilarious episodes every single day when they use to air them in the afternoon. It is now 20 years later and nothing has changed. After all these years they are still hysterically funny and fresh. Episode after episode, we are awarded with great animation, lovable characters and some of the most violent activity ever captured on film. The majority of the episodes feature that lovable rodent Jerry trying to escape from the clutches of the mischievous and not-so-clever feline Tom and like another classic cartoon icon, Wile E Coyote, this cat and mouse team use some highly inventive and sadistic ways of torturing each other. In some instances when things are not going as planned, the duo will become pals or join forces to outsmart either Mammy Two-Shoes (Tom's owner) or another feline imposter but their friendships are usually short lived. Other episodes show us their complex relationship; they hate each other but can't live without one another. One of the funniest factors of these cartoons is the facial expressions of the main characters. In the earlier episodes, Jerry was chubbier with an extraordinarily beguiling smile. He would often look at the camera (the viewer) to let us know that he was up to no good. His character became somewhat leaner throughout the years but never losing his original charm. Tom (or Jasper as he was originally called) also went through some physical changes. His facial expressions were just as charming as Jerry's, usually sporting a ""pout"" when confronted by his pint-sized rival.

There are many incarnations of this winning comedy duo but the best are the ones showcased here; the originals. Forget the Chuck Jones versions and the later ones that were to follow because they are greatly inferior to these classic original cartoon shorts.

Due to ""political correctness"", some of the shorts have been edited. Personally, I think this is a mistake. I view these cartoons as a piece of history and unfortunately during Tom and Jerry's active years, certain stereo-types were often displayed in art. Whoopi Goldbergs informs us of this in the introduction and I personally think that a disclaimer would have been sufficed along with the unedited cartoons. Regardless, the material on this DVD is high-caliber and worthy of nothing less than 5 stars. They don't make cartoons like this anymore and time has done nothing to diminish its brilliance; highly recommended.",1165795200,2,2624,5.029885057471264

Some items may not be suitable for the wee ones, but the box clearly states that fact.

2385744,5,B000ADS61M,"Just like with Volume 1 of this DVD series, we're witnessing unnecessarily histrionic reviews from crybabies who can't see the forest for the trees. It's a miracle to have these classic T&J shorts on DVD at all, and even the crybabies can't deny the episodes while they scream self-righteously about geek minutiae. Granted, there is one major problem with this second Spotlight collection. When you start the DVDs, the first thing to play is a poorly considered and badly written introduction presented by Whoopi Goldberg. The issue is the politically incorrect Mammy Two Shoes character, who was completely absent from Volume 1. Here Goldberg explains that Mammy appears in this volume, apologizes for the fact that the character is a racist stereotype, and then apologizes again that she is included here. This type of bleeding heart over-sensitivity may be necessary for beginners who both refuse to face the flaws of human nature, and can't appreciate classic animation, but it's useless and uninformative for hardcore fans. Fortunately, this annoying feature can be bypassed in half a second by hitting the Menu button, allowing you to do what you gotta do - watch the episodes already.

Once you get past that roadblock, you're rewarded with another 38 incredibly valuable and hysterical T&J shorts. All appearances of Mammy Two Shoes are in this volume, and while she's certainly an exaggerated racial caricature, open-minded fans will see that she's not THAT offensive. Of course Tom & Jerry are immortally hilarious because of their random acts of violence and senseless brutality! (T&J have been my faves since early childhood, and I don't drop anvils on people's heads and place dynamite sticks in their eyes. Modern worries about impressionable kids being brainwashed by cartoon violence are either paranoid, or today's kids are real dopes.) As with all the classic T&J, we find stupendous musical accompaniment by Scott Bradley, and astonishing animation by the Hanna & Barbera team, both of which are jampacked with action and details. The artwork is remarkable overall - for example, see the beautiful Spanish backgrounds in ""Mucho Mouse"" or the madcap construction hijinks in ""Tot Watchers."" Here is the final proof that animation has rarely, if ever, exceeded the artistry of the 1940s and 50s.

Now that we have these two collections of classic Tom & Jerry shorts, more is needed. So far we have nothing definitive for the other characters that were produced in separate cartoons by the same team, notably Barney Bear and (especially) Droopy. We want Droopy!!! And we also need a Tom & Jerry DVD set collecting all the shorts from the later Chuck Jones years, which are nearly as classic. While we wait endlessly for those goodies, we have been blessed with these collections of the immortal originals, as Tom and Jerry still reign as the funniest and most lovable cartoon stars of all time.

2385746,4,B000ADS61M,"I found a few of the shorts that contained the re-recorded african american Women's voice. I almost wonder if it wasn't Warner Bros. that did this but that goofball Ted Turner, he always had a tendancy to ruin things like that. Because the voices weren't redone on all of them and still had the very stereo-typical voice. I would think that if Warner Bros. was that concerned about offending people they would have done it on all of the episodes.

Quality wise the collection is pretty good even though for some reason they put some of the same cartoons that were on the first volume. They were at any rate they were restored with great care the colors were rich just as I would expect any Technicolor production to look and all of the sound was clean and was void of lots of static from the recordings.

Now I get to the part that kind of bugs me. I for one can't really stand Whoopi Goldberg but thats beside the point that the little introduction about racial stereotyping IMHO was completely inappropriate and extremely tacky. We all know that racial jokes were very popular in the fifties and sixties and we know that they are offensive if told today. We get that and don't need someone to tell us that. Thanks but no thanks.

Overall I'd say that if you are into collecting old cartoons such as this its a good purchase. However, if you are just looking for something to entertain the kids you might steer clear its kind of expensive for something that isn't totally appropriate for children.",1140566400,17,1498,4.54074074074074
2385747,4,B000ADS61M,"It's hard to read these ""These cartoons are edited"" reviews on Amazon, simply because they don't give a brief explanation on exactly WHICH cartoons are missing cuts or containing the redubbed voices of Mammy-Two Shoes.

After buying this set, I am able to find out which cartoons contain the redubbed voice of Mammy-Two Shoes. Out of the 37 cartoons (excluding TEXAS TOM which is already included on Volume 1), only four contain the redubbed voice of Mammy, which are:

Saturday Evening Puss
Knit-Witty Kitty
Polka Dot Puss(?)
The Lonesome Mouse

Now after reading those ""These cartoons are edited"" reviews, I thought at first Warner Bros. only used the Cartoon Network/Boomerang prints which leave out minor cuts, but amazingly, these cartoons, which have been literally edited on Cartoon Network/Boomerang (or any other major TV network)--

Puss Gets the Boot
Fraidy Cat
Dog Trouble
Puss n' Toots
The Mouse Comes to Dinner
Mouse in Manhattan
Trap Happy
Part-Time Pal
Old Rockin' Chair Tom
Safety Second

--ARE PRESENTED IN THEIR ORIGINAL UNEDITED FORMS RIGHT HERE IN THIS DVD SET!! That was more than what I would expect when it comes to the WB releasing MGM cartoons on DVD. The rest of the cartoons in this set are presented unedited as well! How about that?

I wouldn't know whether or not to recommend this DVD set to  anybody, depending on how they are writing reviews here on Amazon, but I would pinpoint my opinion on this set: On the downside, it's still a disgrace to have a few cartoons contain redubbed voices of Mammy, and neither is it any better than Volume 1.

Fast forward a year, and Volume 2 is announced with renewed claims that the shorts contained are uncut. While some of the shorts featuring the now-controversial character Mammy Two-Shoes have the original voice (which belies a reference to Hattie McDaniel of Gone With the Wind fame), others feature the redubbed ""politically correct"" voice that Turner created in the '90s. The bottom line here is that Warner Bros.' (or at least their children's video division) can't be trusted to produce an uncut DVD set (or even a restored set, as most of the prints here are the same ones seen on Cartoon Network and Boomerang), much less to be honest with their intentions.

2385757,5,B000ADS61M,"Its a shame all the negativity about this DVD set regarding edited episodes and Warners' ridiculous disclaimer on the back of the DVD stating that ""intended for the adult collector and may not be suitable for children"" (I can't think of anything MORE appropriate for children). The bottom line is that this is an effortlessly enjoyable, downright hilarious series that has lost none of its magic in all these years. Just try not to fall over laughing in epsiodes like ""Sleepy Time Tom"", ""Triplet Trouble"" and ""Cruise Cat"" (just to name a few). Personally I find the later episodes more endearing and hysterical because they made Tom's facial and body tics more pronounced . Yes, the obvious voice dubbing of Mammy Two Shoes is disheartening, but the real charm here are the lovable antics between cat and mouse. Grab your kids and/or significant other and a tub of popcorn, relax, and prepare to be charmed, entertained and bowled over with laughter through this delightful DVD set.",1130976000,2,982,4.921686746987952

2385759,5,B000ADS61M,"So here it is, TOM & JERRY SPOTLIGHT COLLECTION, VOL. II.  On this collection, for the first time on video since their appearances on laserdisc box sets of the complete output of the series, are prints of cartoons that are often either censored from TV packages of the series or scissored or altered so that they are airable, regardless of whether the cartoon makes sense with such alterations or not, and this is why this set is truly collectable.

To add to the collectability of these sets, each disk opens with a disclaimer of sorts from comedienne Whoopi Goldberg, discussing her fondness for the series and her acknowledgment of these rarely included titles and the character that forces them into retirement from most TV packages, the human who often chastises Tom for his lackluster efforts to catch that mouse, Mammy Two Shoes.  She makes note of the fact that the voice of this character, Lillian Randolph, has made her name in both radio and TV and that her character is an integral part of the series.  Instead of dismissing the character, she says, she is offered here as representation of the times in which these cartoons were originally created and that it is better explored than needlessly swept under the rug as they were not meant to so much mock and disrespect the race as they were to poke mild fun at the way Hollywood often portrayed some people of color.  She does acknowledge that the caricatures were wrong then and they are wrong now.

But as we look at these cartoons, we note that the focus of most of the humor is the tortured attempts of the cat to outwit the mouse.  In ""PUSS GETS THE BOOT"", the first cartoon that actually opened the Hanna-Barbera series, although credited to Rudolph Ising, we watch as Jerry, a then unnamed pest in the house, constantly teases the cat, here named Jasper, with plates that he would drop if the cat dared to leap after him, only to end up badly with a series of broken dishes and other knickknacks and, thus, the cat getting tossed out of the house anyway!  We also take note of the fact that the cartoon to follow, ""THE MIDNIGHT SNACK"" is almost the same cartoon as we previously sat through, only this time with Bill Hanna and Joe Barbera directing and even redesigning the characters a little bit to look closer to the cat and mouse we are used to watching.  They are still at odds with each other, with Tom getting tossed out of the house, but we then see a bit of a temporary truce between the two in ""THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS"", a wonderful Holiday cartoon with the music score adding to the slight pathos as Tom suffers guilt for having finally gotten rid of the mouse, Jerry, by tossing him out through the mail slot in the door.  We hear the somewhat dark strains of a combination of ""It Came Upon a Midnight Clear"" and ""Silent Night"" with the ominous line ""sleep in heavenly peace"" as Tom lays a funeral wreath at Jerry's mousehole, thinking that he may never come back, only to discover the frozen mouse just outside the door, and we know the battle of wits continues for another day and many more years.

This is the best of the existing two SPOTLIGHT COLLECTION sets of TOM & JERRY cartoon shorts from MGM, courtesy of Warner Home Video, merely because of the daring attempt to unearth the afore-mentioned rare cartoons and put them in their proper perspectives, and that is why this set should be supported by collectors of the art of animation.  Having said this, there are a few noteworthy mistakes that almost go toward removing the credibility of the afore-mentioned preamble by Ms. Goldberg.  First of all, four of these titles, ""SATURDAY EVENING PUSS"", ""THE LONESOME MOUSE"", ""POLKA DOT PUSS"" and ""KNIT-WITTY KITTY"" feature the dubbed tracks that were later done to allow the titles to be aired on the various cartoon cable stations and/or on the major TV networks that would ever again broadcast TOM & JERRY cartoons.  This mistake even spills over into Whoopi Goldberg's wonderful comments about the voice contribution to the character.  As she explains just who Lillian Randolph is, even siting her contribution to the movie ""IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE"", we suddenly hear the dubbed track!!  Now I know for a fact that this was NOT the way that this track was meant to go out to the public, but there it is.  Aside from this, for no apparent reason, ""TEXAS TOM"" appears on this collection as well, again an oversight that was not meant to happen, but if anyone HAD to own a representation of what makes the odd little ""friendly"" squabbles of this cat and mouse team so endearing in the theatrical age, THIS is the volume to own, and we can and should hope that collections like this can only get better as this bold new step to bring these films, uncut, to the forefront for the parusal of general audiences moves forward.

Focus instead on the nuances of the cat and mouse ""relationship"".  Aside from the temporary truce in ""THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS"", we get ""LONESOME MOUSE"", a cartoon that shows that the mouse could get bored once the cat is tossed out of the house, having been blamed for damage originally done by the mouse, and an elaborate and violent strategy is underway to once again force Mammy to need Tom's awkward attempts at relinquishing the mouse for good.  In ""PART-TIME PAL"", Tom is ordered by the lady of the house to remain on guard in the kitchen, which he does, until a raucous chase lands him in the punch bowl and he is rendered roaringly drunk and interested in nothing more than maliscious mischief which it is now Jerry's job to thwart at every turn, lest the bumbling cat again land himself out of the house forever.  In ""OLD ROCKIN' CHAIR TOM"", Tom is sent packing when a younger, faster mouser is brought in by the apt name of Lightning.  The cat is given this name because his entrance into the scene is merely one bright red stream of electrical current as he zaps about the house, nimbly scooping up Jerry and kicking him headlong out the door.  So where does this relationship sour?  The younger mouser gets the older cat tossed out and both Tom and Jerry, now homeless, scheme to regain their respective domiciles, causing Lightning to swallow an iron and pulling him out with the force of a magnet.

So, with such cartoons as these, we see that the chase is inevitable and forever.  This collection should be savored in hopes that, with the next volume, if at all, they will get it right and we will see even more in the way of extras around the series, maybe even displaying the original openings of the first TV appearance of TOM & JERRY, with the montage of scenes from the Hanna-Barbera cartoons compiled and arranged by LOONEY TOONS animator Chuck Jones who actually created his own TOM & JERRY series for theaters.  There is still more exploring in this series to do.  After all, it would be nice to see some representations of the Chuck Jones cartoons and even the stranger, more stylized versions of the cat and mouse antics by Gene Deitsch, who came to MGM for a brief while from Paul Terry's studios in New York, where he had animated the likes of DEPUTY DAWG, SICK, SICK SIDNEY and others.  We also need to see the Hanna-Barbera cartoon one shots created for MGM throughout their tenure with the cat and mouse being their main focus.  This, therefore, is truly the beginning and hopefully NOT the end.",1130803200,8,7338,4.605061349693251
2385760,2,B000ADS61M,"Didn't buy the first collection because of all of the negative reviews (and because I still have my Art of Tom and Jerry Laserdiscs that shows them in release order).  After reading there would be a P.C. disclamer on the set I went out and bought it expecting unedited cartoons.  Well, Mammy is back in place, but her voice in some of the episodes was re-dubbed to make her sound less stereotypical.  And this after Whoopi G. spends 3 minutes telling us that the character is so important to the series that she just can't be left out.  Poor Tom and Jerry.  Will we ever see the original versions again?  Either we see Mammy dropped and re-animated as a white woman, or we see Mammy and have her voice altered (in the 60s she even was redubbed with an Irish accent in some cartoons!).  Or on TV she's just edited out sometimes.  I give up.",1130630400,14,839,4.367741935483871

I don't think, as a child I understood the ""black face"" jokes.  And I've never attempted to bash my cats over the head with shovels, either.  From what I have found elswhere on the world wide web, the Tom and Jerry cartoons will never me remastered since the original negatives were destroyed in a fire decades ago.  This is as good as it gets (and they look much better than on our TV of twenty-five years ago).  I've noticed that Mammy's voice in a couple of episodes sounds a little different than in others, but the accent is still there (these may have been the only copies left, I don't know).  Because of the ""accidental"" inclusion of edited cartoons on the original set, Warners did their best to make sure that the episodes in this set are unedited.  It looks like they did a pretty good job.  They even include a commentary/introduction to disc 2 by Whoopi Goldberg to expain the presence of Mammy and her importance to Tom and Jerry.  She includes a PC segment of how these cartoons were wrong to include stereotypes then and now.  However, folks, remember these cartoons are a reflection of the time period.  This set is wonderful and as a long-time fan of Looney Tunes and Tom & Jerry, I am ecstatic over its release.  Thank you, Warners.",1130457600,6,1453,4.441509433962264

One particularly cringe-worthy pattern I noticed in all of these reviews was the mention of ""Warner Brothers"" as the culprit for releasing these cartoons in edited form.
