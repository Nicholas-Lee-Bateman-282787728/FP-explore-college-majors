2608669,5,B000GG4RMU,"I am a great fan of the food film genre. This includes everything from LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE (from Mexico) to EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN (from Taiwan). TAMPOPO is a (more than) 20 year old Japanese film about the culture's love affair with and cultural connection to food. Particularly, ramen is showcased here (among other entrees). The film follows the chance encounter that two truck drivers, Goro (Tsutomo Yamazaki) and Gun (Ken Watanabe) have with Tampopo (translation: ""Dandelion"") (Nobuko Miyamoto), the owner of a small, failing noodle restaurant that they patronize one stormy night. Goro, the older, more experienced driver, agrees to help coach Tampopo in the art of gourmet noodle production, so she is truly a contender with her competition. Noodle making (and consumption) is truly a fine art, as well as a competitive sport. The provocative sub-plot juxtaposed with the plight of Tampopo is the relationship between a yakuza gangster (Koji Yakusho) and his mistress (Fukumi Kuroda). Food is central in their relationship, as well as in their love for one another. It is, both, metaphor and appetizer......

TAMPOPO's style is really hard to articulate in a simple review. Director Juzo Itami made this film a valentine and spoof of, both, the genre of spaghetti westerns (this, being the first ""noodle"" western of its kind--literally) as well as Japanese yakuza gangster films. It is at once satirically funny and poignant. Also, nothing is really what it seems. This I will say--you will want to grab a good bowl of soup afterwards.......I'm thinking soba, with a rich broth and maybe even some green onion on the side.",1176422400,,1631,5.085820895522388
2608670,5,B000GG4RMU,"I decided to see this film after seeing it mentioned in a lonely planet book about Japanese foods. Intrigued & as a lover of good food, I got it & truly enjoyed the film.

It's a wonderful primer about making good ramen & what it takes to make a truly good ramen. The dedication could be applicable to other foods such as a good burger etc. Since I have not been to Japan & not had japanese ramen noodles, I can't vouch for accuracy but it certainly stimulated a desire to try.

The movie also highlights the observation of John Pawson, the noted minimalist architect, that simplicity is the hardest thing to accomplish & this movie shows that making good ramen takes a lot of effort.

There was a scene where a dying gourmand gangster described that was truly memorable: Hungry wild boars consuming yams during winter are hunted & their intensines are cooked over an open fire. The cooked intensines become yam sausages. This observation was an eye-opener..

The movie also draws a connection between food & eroticism that may not be suitable for children under 13. One scene was quite similar to the food scenes in 9 1/2 weeks but more erotic & inventive.

There is a sense of non-linearity[snippets of stories not connected to main characters] to the story that I enjoyed but other people make not like due to hollywood sensibilities. I liked it also bec it gave a time-stamp of Japan & its people that probably doesnt exist anymore.

People who enjoy cooking & IRON CHEF Japan will really enjoy this movie.",1175731200,,1510,4.6367041198501875
2608671,5,B000GG4RMU,"If you like ramen and Japanese humour, this is for you. I think it's brilliant and highly recommended.",1173830400,,102,4.722222222222222
2608672,5,B000GG4RMU,"This is a Japanese cult film and one which has had serious traction in the West. It contains the roots of the modern Iron Chef series and is a jewel in which is reflected many of the common-or-garden mores that make Japan such a rich and wonderful place. It is a must-see and will not be easily forgotten.

It is a  journey to mastery of ramen making and in this, a journey toward mastery itself. Tampopo, a 'noob' noodle chef, enlists the help of expert advisers one-by-one as she assembles the skills necessary to make a compelling ramen noodle soup in the competitive environment of Japanese ramen-ya (ramen noodle shops). Along the way she steals, bribes and cheats with the support of her advisers but, as the goal is honuorable, in good Japanese (and indeed in other nations') style, the ends justify the means.

Apart from yielding the best ramen imaginable, the film is interspersed with a myriad of vignettes - all food related but otherwise unrelated apart from being elements of Japanese idiosyncrasy. These vary from an old lady who sneaks into delis to squeeze the food with a naughty abandon and then to be chased out by the bemused/confused staff to fabulous sequences with the young Iron Chef chairman as a food obsessed gangster exchanging the yolk of an egg in a kiss with his equally food obsessed lover (the roots of the Iron Chef series are clearly present in this film so if you love food ....).

This is a wonderful film. It holds people for years after viewing with each remembering a different element of beauty. It drew me back after 20 years and I had to find it and see it again. Having just done this (and I cooked ramen to go with the viewing!), it lives up the memory!

Fortunately so does the humor in this film, where everything is equally as savoury as it is sweet and sensual.  This Japanese import is an excellent transfer and a Region 0 disc, so it's much better than the overpriced unfortunate Fox Lorber edition, which is fortunately out of print.",1168819200,6,357,4.933333333333334

2608678,5,B000GG4RMU,"...you will love this movie for it explores (with hysterical results) why food becomes such an important touchstone in life.

Truck driver Goro and Gun are in search of some good eats and run into a widow who is trying to run a ramen shop.  Unfortunately, she's not doing too well so Goro and some unlikely guides offer her some sage advice and help her on her way to becoming a true ramenista.  The story is punctuated with some vignettes about the ""social aspects"" of eating and our behavior with food.

THIS EDITION NOTES: This is a ""no-frills"" deal with the bear minimum of subtitle options and the movie's original trailer.  Although Amazon is listing the zone playability as ""unknown"" the jacket lists it as ALL ZONES. It played on our ancient Zenith DVD player which can only handle zone 1 DVDs and nothing else.

Some of the plot does not make logical sense, but it's intentional, and by then you don't care because you're living on the filmmaker's terms as he entertains you with a rich telling of Japanese attitudes towards food obsession.

Ordered on 16th April when it was out of stock, new copy shipped, from US, 16th of May and received, in London, 30th of May. Considering the the estimated delivery was 21st June that is very good.

When it starts, you have the choice of ""Voice Menu"" or ""Standard Menu"".  I don't understand Japanese, so I chose ""Standard Menu"".  On the Standard Menu, you can choose subtitles, then English subtitles.  I noticed only a few misspelled words.  The movie itself is still as wonderful as I remembered it.  I had forgotten some parts so there were even ""surprises"" as well as getting to see some well-remembered scenes again.",1328745600,,550,4.726315789473684
2608732,5,B000GG4RMU,"I am biased toward this movie. When it came out, it's structure was very edgy. And though it is a bit dated, the storyline and cultural commentary hold up well.

Structured much like a contemporary first person video game, with branches or ""side quests"" into various aspects of Japanese culture, the movie gives insight into interpersonal relationships, the influences of western culture, and stereotypes of Japan. All with a light-hearted and humurous approach.

I reccommend this movie to everyone, but perhaps not all would appreciate it.

It takes plaace in Japan and involves a widow, her young son, her noodle shop and the people she meets who befriend her and help her to gain self respect, happiness and success.

2608734,5,B000GG4RMU,"This movie is one of my all-tile favourites. It's an hommage to cinema, with winks and nods at everything from classic westerns to Kurosawa to Fellini and Godard. It's a scathing critique of the Japanese bubble society of the 80's and by extension, all recent consumer get rich quick socities. Most of all it's a hymn to the human art of making more than just sustenance out of food.",1282867200,2,383,4.565217391304348

2608736,5,B000GG4RMU,"I was so happy to see that Amazon was offering this DVD. After listening to a David Chang interview and hearing his recommendation for this movie, I had to see what all the ruckus was about. This film is awesome. I was a little bit naive and didn't think to read any content reviews for it despite the NR rating, so when the first of many instances of bare breasts were seen in a particular scene I was a bit shocked, so be warned. Luckily that scene is conveniently skippable without missing anything else and there isn't any nudity after that until the credits roll at the end, and even then, it's a long focus on a baby breast feeding, if you consider that nudity. This movie is all about the Japanese love/obsession with food. The film is slightly quirky and after certain scenes I was a bit stunned, not knowing if I should be laughing or taking it serious, but it actually is really funny. The acting was great and the film's pacing was excellent as well, despite being sort of a montage that jumps back and forth with the characters. If you are passionate about food, you need to see this film. And don't forget to affectionately stroke the pork in your bowl.

The DVD doesn't come with anything but the disc and the case. I watched (and probably only will watch) the subbed version.",1279584000,2,1290,4.443037974683544

Truly a masterpiece that can evidently be seen to be inspired by the great works of Akira Kurosawa, and Sergio Leone with a little bit of classic Marx brothers comedy thrown in.

The plot - woman owns a noodle bar and her cooking sucks.  Two milk truck drivers decide to help her become a better noodle cook.  Sounds simple.  It is - but it is also full of stories dealing with and centered around food.  Everything from a business meeting to sex to family to breast feeding is linked to our knowledge, enjoyment and want for food.  Not just plain food, not just our need for food, but our love of food.  We want to eat good food.  Great food!  No culture can just toss the food on the table.  There are rituals.  Traditions.  Things that must be done and things that can't be done.  Is maybe there are no barriers, no limits?  Maybe we should just enjoy it.  Because you never know when the last film may play, when the last bowl of noodles may be finished, when that big noodle bar in the sky will have a seat for you.
Or maybe I'm taking it too seriously?  Just pop it into the DVD player, get a hot bowl of noodles, some chopsticks and ENJOY!  Oh, and slurp your noodles in Japan.

2608767,5,B000GG4RMU,"I first saw this film in college, in a theatre, back in 1987, I think, and in spite of knowing only a little Japanese then, and only a little of Japanese culture, I fell in love with Japan even more deeply after seeing this. If your idea of Japanese movies is Akira Kurosawa and/or anime, then you have to see Itami's movies, and you have to start with this one.
I actually fell onto the floor laughing when I saw this, and it makes me laugh even now. And this is the film (together, now, with Water Boys, Shall We Dance, anything else with Takenaka Naoto, and After Life) I show friends when I want to share Japan (where I lived for ten years) with them.
The wonderful aspect of this movie is the way Itami intercuts the main story, of a woman named Tampopo (Japanese for dandelion, by the way), trying to run a ramen shop and raise a boy on her own, and the two truck drivers who end up helping her recreate that business and teach her son to stand up to bullies, with many of the different ways that Japanese obsess about food. From shopping, to macrobiotic mothers, to ordering in restaurants, to learning how to eat Western food... And Itami's cast, a group of actors he works with time and again, rise to the challenge brilliantly.
If you decide you need to see only one Japanese film, make it this one. And if you're a fan of Japanese film, but have never seen this, then do so immediately!",1233360000,7,1397,4.315589353612167

2608769,4,B000GG4RMU,"Tanpopo is one of the most inventive films made in Japan in the last 30 years. Some regard it as being atypical of Japanese cinema, almost European in construction, while others regard the subject matter as being representative of Japanese cultural essence. Both views can be qualified and verified, but the core of the matter is that Tanpopo is a film with a very simple basic story, a simple moral as found in any Hollywood feel-good movie, good character development, and some outstanding acting performances by both central and peripheral characters. Those are the standard  elements, but what makes the film so unusual is that the core story is interwoven, to varying degrees of depth and connectedness, with other tales, all related by an obsession with food. The film has farcical slapstick, and dry, astringent humour, some of it very black, and tragedy with little or no humour attached.
The DVD has no features, no special information, the case tells next to nothing of the content or production, and some of the sub-titles could have been better translated. It is not terribly cheap considering there is so little other than the film contained within, but that is the point: the film is so good, and can be watched time and time again that the price is certainly worth paying.
Another point is that the disc claims to be region free, so can be enjoyed by anyone, anywhere (as long as their player is able to read and play NTSC system).
If you can watch it without laughing, and without feeling that you really need a fine bowl of Ramen, then you would need to be insensitive to the subject matter, the vivid atmospheres portrayed, the somewhat bizarre construction, and the engaging characters. A fine thing to be savoured, even if not a grand heavyweight, classical masterpiece. A little like a fine bowl of Ramen.
Five stars for the film. One deducted for the basic nature of the product as sold.",1229731200,,1909,4.784848484848485
2608770,5,B000GG4RMU,"This movie is among my surprise favorites - I saw it when I hadn't seen many/any foreign films, but Tampopo motivated me to broaden my horizons. I saw it again on this DVD after having first caught it on VHS a few years ago, and am please the actual movie is still lovely and great fun.

DVD itself: Quality is reasonable. No special bells and whistles with DVD, but this is a movie that most people are just grateful to even FIND on DVD. I believe Netflix does not carry it for some reason. I was very excited when I saw it available here. Colors appear suitable and the many shots of food look fine. (Food often looks strange in films to me, but it looks all right here, so the quality of the image is more than acceptable.) If you are a blu-ray fiend and insist that you see every last hair, then no, the quality isn't like that, but I like the way it looks.

movie itself: basic, basic plot: Woman goes on journey to make the greatest noodles EVER in Japan. On a larger level, movie is about the delight and seduction of food, and an interesting look at the appreciation of ""little"" things that Japanese culture takes pride in. Nothing will go over your head, and it's just such a good time. Watch it with someone you like after eating something you like.

If you have children (I do not have children, and if you want to show this to kids, they're lucky): Some nudity, but nothing creepy or sexually explicit - I'd say for kids over 13, and kids who can understand why people would be obsessed with making noodles. Someone gets shot, but it's almost funny because it's over the top and it's not endorsing violence or anything. It's really about the journey and the effort you throw in that makes something wonderful, which I think is a good lesson for all ages.",1224633600,,1766,4.361702127659575

This movie is hysterical from beginning to end it is genius how such a simple story line can be done so well I cannot imagine it being done any better. This is the movie that really spawned my love and interest in Japanese films. I recommend this movie to everyone.",1223251200,,530,4.205882352941177

2608775,5,B000GG4RMU,"The main storyline is about a bunch of culinary experts helping a noodle shop to become the best. It is funny as it is, but the real treat is in the sidetracks. The film has lots of sidebar stories, very loosely connected to the main noodle shop story. However, each and every sidebar is a satire on some aspect of Japanese culture and social customs - without being antagonistic on either.

The film is very funny and it gives you with that warm fuzzy feeling at the end. While being very entertaining, it also makes you think about the Japanese social customs. Possibly about a noodle soup for dinner as well :-)",1221091200,,614,4.482142857142857
2608776,4,B000GG4RMU,"Tampopo is one of the true classics of culinary cinema. It's all foolishness of one kind or another, but the performances are very sincere and charming and draw you into the seemingly nonsensical quest.

I don't know one person who has not enjoyed this film.  Meet the hero:  a cowboy/samurai truck driver type.  Meet the damsel in distress:  Tampopo, a single mom trying to make her lunch bar succeed.  And the bad guy?  A yakusa-type bad boy wannabe who unveils his very tasteful interior decorating skills and pitches in to help the pretty widow.  Then there is the unforgettable ""professor"", the con man, the dying mother who manages to get up from her death bed to make one last meal for her family, the dentist (and a sexy dentist assistant).

2608790,5,B000GG4RMU,"This is a delightful punning play on the theme of a spaghetti western. The main story revolves around the tale of a threatened noodle shop and its widowed owner. A very broadly drawn cowboy rides into town in this pickup truck (complete with horns on the hood) and saves the day. Side plots include a society of homeless gastronomes, an example of mother-love gone way too far and the best use of a shrimp by a gangster in any movie ever.

The serious underside is that this is a mouth-watering depiction of the love of food and it would be a rare gourmet who didn't have to stop the dvd at least once to grab a snack.

There are several version listed and this is the only one I've seen. It is a story of a women whose goal is to learn how to make to best bowl of soup ever. There is some subtle humor in this and you find yourself really rooting for the main character. It is definitely a different type of movie, but I have encountered many people over the years that rave about this movie. I wouldn't consider a cult classic, though some people do. There is overtones of discrimination as she is a woman and is trying to do a man's job. I love the trials and tribulations she goes through to perfect her craft.

The main story is about a woman trying to upgrade her mediocre noodle restaurant to the best noodle place in town. In her quest to find out about the perfect noodle soup she teams up with a variety of characters, one even more colorful than the next.

Throughout the movie also run a bunch of other food-related stories. Especially the side tale about a Yakuza mobster and his mistress is beautiful and unforgettable with scenes of pure art.

Overall the movie is great fun and full with love for food and life in general. This should be watched by all of you who have a passion.",1200096000,,653,4.433333333333334

2608820,5,B000GG4RMU,"Tampopo is a rare thing indeed: a film with a brain, a heart - and a stomach!

Milk truck driver Goro and his friend Gun stumble across a sleepy noodle bar while out working. The owner of Lai Lai is the widow Tampopo, for whom times are hard. She's not helped by the fact that, frankly, her noodle soup isn't so good. So, in the spirit of Shane, Goro decides to help  Tampopo make the perfect noodle soup.

This is the main thread of the story, but weaved in amongst it are a succession of stories that show the role of food in Japanese society. Some are funny, some touching and some revel in the sensual pleasure that eating can bring.

Standouts include lunch in a French restaurant for a group of salarymen, a teacher at a finishing school showing a group of young women how to eat spaghetti Western style, a family sharing their last meal with their ding mother and the infamous scene with the gangster, his girlfriend and a raw egg yolk.

Each scene is insightful in some way about the role of food in Japanese life. The role of women in this is also explored too;each time something positive or good happens, somewhere a woman is involved.

I first saw this film nearly twenty years ago and am glad to have finally found a chance to watch it again. I recalled it as one of my favourite films and time has, I'm glad to say, not dimmed that recollection: it's every bit as good as I remember. Sound and picture quality are pretty good overall, with english subtitles available. There are few extras (only really the trailer) and the chapter menus, for example, are entirely in Japanese, suggesting that little has been done to the release when brought into the US. This is not a bad thing, to be honest, and adds something to the disc's character.",1186358400,,1752,4.442367601246106

2608822,5,B000GG4RMU,"This is on my top ten list of the funniest, most delightful movies of all time. The main plot line is a loving satire of the ""adult"" western of the fifties - ""Shane"" in particular - where the hero drifts into town, helps the poor widow get her life together and beat the bad guys, then drifts out again.  Tampopo, the heroine, must make the best noodle soup in town to overcome the villainous other noodle houses.

But what makes this movie extraordinary are the vignettes, both within the plot-line and outside it, that mingle food, sex, cultural hangups, life and death in hilarious and sometimes very touching combinations.

The movie succeeds not only because of its marvellous material and fine actors but also through excellent direction and cinematography. For example, the scene toward the end where Tampopo & Goro are eating companionably in a restaurant: notice the camera movement from the food to the people; the positions of the actors conveying clearly the ambiguity of the relationship and their attitudes to each other; how at times Goro actually has his back to the camera; the cut to the symbolic passing train, nicely understated; the whole scene is an example of effective simplicity in movie-making.

This movie is ultimately unclassifiable; it is itself, funny, sad (sometimes both at once), shocking, absorbing; but above all funny.  I have never seen another film quite like it, and it stays in the memory like the best of Fellini.",1186012800,29,1455,4.922448979591837

2608826,5,B000GG4RMU,"A delightful noodle Western. A widowed mother of one finds unlikely allies in her grail-like quest for the best ramen noodles and soup. This, contrary to what one might believe, is serious business. It requires dedication, perseverance, artistry, risk and even espionage. If you love food, comedy, films that poke fun at popular culture, kitsch romance, high cinema; if you revel in a great story served with a healthy dash of mushy love and more than a sprinkling of burly machismo; if, above all, you love a happy ending, you'll love Tampopo.
