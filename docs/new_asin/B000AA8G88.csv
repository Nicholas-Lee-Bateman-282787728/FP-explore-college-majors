8076925,5,B000AA8G88,"Once again, Donald and Kasia have done a good job.  I found tango probably the hardest of the ballroom dances to learn.  Footwork for the intermediate patterns can get complex, and to lead you have to pay much more attention to your frame than in most dances.  But they do a decent job of covering the problems of following and leading in this DVD.  And as always, they've got DVD chapters set up so it's easy to pop it in the DVD player and go right to where you want to start your practice.

Covers a decent number of dance patterns, beginner up through intermediate.  There's actually enough different moves in here that you could maybe dance a whole song without getting too bored (not the case with most beginner level DVD lessons).

Definitely recommended.",1226016000,7,762,4.6
