5046169,5,B0070B9RFQ,"1795 adventures continue in Dark Shadows DVD Collection 6 (VHS Volumes 37-44).  In these episodes, Barnabas Collins rises as a vampire and unleashes terror throughout Collinsport.  Knowing that he can't go on hurting people, Barnabas begs family servant Ben Stokes to drive a stake through his heart.  Ben can't bring himself to do it, however.  Barnabas secretly sees Josette and they agree to spend eternity together as vampires.  Before he can take her away, Angelique lures her to Widows Hill, where Josette sees a vision of herself as a vampire and she jumps to her death.  Naomi Collins attempts to prevent Lt. Nathan Forbes from marrying Millicent Collins (he only wants her for her money).  In Victoria's witchcraft trial, Reverend Trask convinces Nathan to testify against Victoria.  Nathan betrays Victoria and she is found guilty of witchcraft.  Barnabas vows revenge against Trask.
Bonuses include interviews with Roger Davis (Peter Bradford), Lara Parker (Angelique), Louis Edmonds (Joshua Collins), and scenic designer Sy Tomashoff.",1066521600,15,1046,5.407407407407407
5046170,5,B0070B9RFQ,"With the sixth excellent DVD in the Dark Shadows series, Barnabas Collins continues his cursed existence as a vampire, and Victoria Winters is put on trial for witchcraft.  For those who haven't seen the entire series, a few questions will be answered, like the origins of the ghosts of Sarah Collins and Josette DuPres.  The 1795 saga really heats up in this DVD, and the next set will conclude it and begin the Adam and Eve / Dream Curse story.  The sound and video on the DVD are as good as can be considering the age of the material, and as always we get four interviews with actors and crew members from the show.  I can't recommend this series highly enough for those who enjoy gothic story telling.  Of course for fans of the show these DVD sets are must-haves.  Only about 4 more sets until fan favorite Quentin Collins makes his debut on DVD!",1056758400,3,851,4.458064516129032
5046171,5,B0070B9RFQ,"If you're a fan of the old series and were made bankrupt by the price of dark shadows on vhs, this is the perfect solution.  I've been a fan since I was a young child, which happened to be after the original run, but only by a year or two.
The interviews at the end are mostly good, some are really lame, like Lara Parker's soliloquy (sp?) on vampires and the sexual beings that they are.  But, others give real insight into the show, including the ones with Jonathan Frid and Kathryn Leigh Scott.  It wasn't until these videos that I saw an up to date picture of Frid.  He's better looking now than he was then.
The quality of the video is very good, I would call it above average.  There are still some kinescope episodes, but that will never be helped. At least we have something.
I highly recommend this series.",1056585600,16,815,4.300653594771242

Barnabas Collins has now become a vampire and must feed off the blood of innocent people to survive. He is aided by his servant, Ben Stokes. Angelique has died, but the Collins family is still cursed. Lt. Nathan Forbes takes a dark turn and testifies against Vicky in the infamous witch trial. He plans to marry Millicent in order to take all her money. The day Josette jumps to her doom approaches as Vicky tries to help warn them and save the past. We're treated to some very rewarding deaths, crazy weird acid trip dream sequences, cheesy fights and much more. This is quite possibly the greatest soap opera of all time because it's filled with supernatural elements like ghosts, witches, vampires, and eventually werewolves.

Oy vey! More trouble for the 1795 Collins clan. Do these people ever get a break? Even in death they are forced to climb out of their graves to roam the great house, the old house, and the grounds in between.

Barnabas sulks around the coffin room of the old house while Ben Stokes tries to run errands for the demanding vampire. Joshua Collins, Barnabas' beleagured dad, manages to be one of the few family members left alive at the end of this summer of surprises because he just doesn't love Barnabas enough to suffer Angelique's curse.

Reverend Trask keeps up his antics in trying to convict Vicki of witchcraft, while Peter Bradford falls more deeply in love with the bewildered Collins governess.

And Josette suffers a smiliar ghostly makeover to Jeremiah's when she reappears at Barnabas' behest.

What can I say? Another DVD chock full of episodes that will entertain all emotions ;^)

**Some might consider the comments below to be spoilerish. If you've never seen the show and don't want to know a thing, don't read further**

The action in 1795 continues in this set, as Barnabas is cursed by a dying Angelique and becomes a creature of the night - as a vampire he must have blood to survive. Victoria Winters goes on trial for witchcraft (some scenes were a bit on the tedious side), Barnabas vows revenge on the evil Reverend Trask (loved it), and Nathan Forbes schemes to wed Millicent Collins and get his hands on her money. Joshua Collins discovers the truth about his son and is determined to stop Barnabas before he brings harm to others.

As noted, I did find the trials of Victoria a wee bit tiring after a while and overly melodramatic at that. I loved the character of ditsy Millicent as played by Nancy Barrett, she really stole a scene or two and I looooooooooooooved the look on Nathan's face after the wedding ceremony and he realizes she gave the money away. Priceless. The best of all though were the scenes between Barnabas and Joshua - Louis Edmonds and Jonathan Frid really shined in these episodes. As for Angelique, she made be *dead* but she's still stirring the pot and the witch everyone loves to hate.

The set includes four DVD's with ten episodes on each one, plus interviews with former cast and crew members at the end of each. I found the one with a very old but still charming Louis Edmonds to be my favorite so far.",1295827200,,1597,4.47766323024055

Still stuck in 1795, Victoria has been captured by Reverend Trask who believes she is the witch. Angelique confesses her love for Barnabas, however she decides to make Barnabas suffer more because he does not love her. He still loves Josette. Angelique forces Barnabas to marry her, then she will make his little sister, Sarah, well again.
  The Collins family prepares to move into their new estate, Collinwood.
Barnabas finds out Angelique is the witch. He shoots Angelique, but she survives. A bat attacks Barnabas. He later dies and is buried in the Mausoleum's hidden room. Angelique tries to drive a stake into his heart, but Barnabas awakes and strangles her. He knows now he is a vampire.

5046219,5,B0070B9RFQ,"I love the dark shadows soap opera. It was a little bit before my time,but I don't care. I will watch it over and over again. I remember when I was really young,my mother would watch it on ABC at 3:00p.m.everyday. Then it was off for awhile. But then I found the scifi channel. And ever since then I have been watching it on reruns. When I learned about Amazon.com,I bought the entire collection. Even my kids like watching it. As far as I am concerned,this show is the most valuable family heirloom we will ever have!",1286496000,,518,4.350515463917525
5046220,5,B0070B9RFQ,"I do remember watching some episodes of Dark Shadows as a child in the 1960's, though my mother expressed concerns that I would have bad dreams at night if I did watch this soap opera. So, I missed much. Fortunately, this series is now available in its entirety, in 26 collections (if you don't count the In The Beginning collections). I'm on this collection, number six, at the moment.

The best thing about Dark Shadows is the top-notch acting done by the entire cast. When I first decided to purchase this series, I worried that the acting would be like most of today's lousy horror movie quality. However, this was not the case. In fact, these actors in Dark Shadows are of the highest caliber in talent. Even the actress who played little Sara is very effective; who can see her peeking at the lines she speaks occasionally, though. The people who work behind the scenes (writers, music composer, make-up artists, studio designers, etc.)really seem to have done their homework in helping to make Dark Shadows an errie, but interesting soap opera.

In this collection, number six, the Collins family is living in the year 1795. The viewer gets a good explaination for many developments that were a mystery in the 1967 version of family events: how Barnabas came to be a vampire, why Josette jumped at Widow's Hill, etc. The actress Lara Parker adds extra elements of sexual desire in her role as the wicked witch, who works at making everyone believe that Victoria is really the witch.

Dark Shadows is an all time classic!",1250640000,2,1527,4.7330827067669174
5046221,5,B0070B9RFQ,The contents of this series are very good.  The condition of the DVD was excellent.  The time that it took for the DVD to arrive was more than reasonable.,1240617600,,154,4.275862068965517
5046222,3,B0070B9RFQ,"Because I have been a diehard fan of Dark Shadows since childhood, it is hard for me to find anything wrong with my beloved show. But, in my humble opinion, the 1795 flashback starts to drag about halfway through. The first mistake Curtis made with this flashback was removing Angelique from the spotlight, and then killing off Josette. This flashback was actually my least favorite flashback of all the time-travel sequences, and should have been shortened by at least a month's worth of episodes. The sets and costumes (in comparison to other flashbacks) was weak at best. Additionally, the Vicky Winters character is given little to do, despite the fact she is the one who transcended time and discovered the Collins family of the past. The Reverand Trask of 1795 is not nearly as deliciously wicked as Gregory Trask of 1897, and having Joan Bennett in a submissive role is not at all enjoyable...she is at her best when she is a strong character (as Elizabeth Stoddard and Judith Collins). Joel Crothers acting as Joe was very good, but his attempt at Lt. Nathan Forbes was abominable. And what was Nancy Barrett trying to do with Millicent? One can barely tolerate the painful scenes with her. Stick to playing Carolyn, Nancy. You were quite fun playing Pansy Faye, but definitely NOT with Millicent. Basically, although the 1795 flashback starts out quite interestingly, I do feel they strung it out much too long. Three stars is the most generous I can be with this one.",1235433600,,1477,4.818897637795276

5046225,5,B0070B9RFQ,"In one of the most truly errie coincidences in Television, Jerry Lacey was hired to play the role of a Detective/Investigator/Lawyer type in his initial stunt for Dark Shadows. He looked like Sam Spade played by Humphrey Bogart in the old 40's movies and eventually ironically was hired by Woody Allen to play Bogart's ghost in ""Play it Again SAM"".  He did so well in the role of REVEREND TRASK for the 1795 shoot that he became perhaps the second most interesting character up to that point opposite the ever popular Vampire, Barnabas Collins. He continued to get more air time as the audience loved the portrayal by Lacey of a VERY RADICAL SELF- ORDAINED REVEREND/WITCH HUNTER in ""Trask"". Cleverly the story writers chimed his activities in with the Salem Witch Trials and became the basis for the reputation of Trask for the role he played. Needless to say, he finally encounters some real evil and falls for all the tricks that are employed against him. In his efforts to persecute, he arrests the wrong suspect, gets clobbered by Barnabas's magic and beat up by Angelique. He is led to his death by deception in a dream sequence, not remembering his Bible to ""Test the spirits to see if they are from God"". Instead he convinces himself through the influence of the dream that he will find the answers at the Old House of Collinwood. It is here that Barnabas has arranged his revenge in one of the most memorable sequences of the entire 1795 run. One cannot help but feel sorry in the end for the overmatched Trask. Walled into an unknown grave while still alive ala' a bit of ""POE-etic"" justice. This and the work performed by Ben Stokes make this a very memorable DVD set in one of the highlights of the era of Dark Shadows that tied up all the loose ends from the beginning of the series. Fascinating, interesting and very clever!",1160870400,11,1837,4.617737003058104
5046226,4,B0070B9RFQ,"There's not much to add to the other enthusiastic comments here, so I'll only say that this sixth collection of ""Dark Shadows"" episodes continues the addictive fun of the first five sets.  This particular set is notable for a minimum of dialogue and production flubs, allowing you to just sit back and enjoy- with hardly any chuckle-inducing distractions- the gothic, creepy proceedings.  And creepy they are, as these 40 episodes, all set in 1795, show Barnabas Collins' tragically accepting his new fate as one of the undead.  All kinds of other interesting things happen, too, both in the supernatural and non-supernatural realms.  Interestingly, some of the non-supernatural stuff is just as scary as the supernatural happenings... witness the final fate of Reverend Trask, for example.  Anyway, if you enjoyed the previous sets of this series, there's no reason to hesitate in getting this set.  Myself, I've already moved onward to the seventh collection!",1159833600,3,961,5.248366013071895

5046229,5,B0070B9RFQ,"The 175-year-old vampire Barnabas Collins (Shakespearean actor Jonathan Frid) who turned the soap opera DARK SHADOWS from forgettable to famous was originally supposed to be dealt with and disposed of entirely in the present day.  The events of 1795 that made Barnabas a vampire and took away his true love Josette were to serve only as a back story.  But Barnabas's popularity changed the plan.  He was spared the hammer-and-stake treatment, viewers were transported to 1795, and that back story became the main plot.

This installment continues the 1795 sequence from a point shortly after Barnabas becomes a vampire.  Angelique's curse starts having its intended effect as those who love Barnabas die.  and at long last, we see Josette's suicide -- the big event we've been hearing about for so long.  After all the buildup, this could have been a disappointment, but in my opinion, it wasn't.

What DIDN'T work for me was the ""Monkey's Paw"" variation involving Josette's ghost.  It's a nice little shocker but with three problems.  First, anyone familiar with the original W.W. Jacobs short story will see that DS missed the  point  -- that what's imagined is much more terrifying than what's actually seen.  Jacobs never shows the THING behind the door, but when Josette lifts her veil, we see her mangled face in all its gory glory.  Second, this sequence  doesn't go anywhere.  Barnabas realizes he goofed, sends Josette back to her grave, and that's that.  Third, after we've seen EVERYTHING up to this point, it's frustrating to have Barnabas send Josette back off-screen.

One person who escapes Angelique's curse is Barmabas's father, Joshua Collins -- ironically, because of a flaw in his character.  Joshua is a hardened, cold-hearted man who is incapable of loving anyone, including his own son.  The curse said that anyone who loved Barnabas would die.  Because Joshua can't love Barnabas, the curse can't touch him.

I find Joshua's reaction to Barnabas interesting because it's so much a product of his character.  Joshua believes it's his right to be in charge and in control, and can't stand having that right violated.  So, when confronted with the incomprehensible and unspeakable horror of his son being a vampire (in #447), Joshua HAS to take charge.  He pretty much blackmails Barnabas into letting himself be locked in the tower room at Collinwood.  (And I feel there's a plausibility problem here.  Would it be possible to drag that coffin all the way up to the tower room?)

I was also interested to see the non-supernatural storyline involving Suki Forbes, Nathan's not-quite-ex-wife, who shows up to blackmail him.  To some extent, this sequence, along with all the subsequent nastiness between Nathan and Millicent,  recalls the pre-Barnabas portion of DS, which was more about mystery and intrigue than horror.

The other major storyline is the witch trial of Victoria Winters, our involuntary time traveler.  Her prosecutor is the self-ordained, fanatical witch hunter, Reverend Trask.  Her defender is a young prison employee and aspiring lawyer named Peter Bradford, who is fast becoming the new love of her life.

Trask blackmails Nathan Forbes into giving false testimony, and I've heard this cited as evidence that Trask's motives are not quite so pure as he would have everyone believe.  I would argue, however, that those who are convinced they're on the side of righteousness can justify any action in the name of righteousness.  And rather than maligning Christians, this incident shows Trask as a miserable excuse for one because of his ego.  The true Christian would ask God to let the truth be revealed, even if that meant losing the case.

Angelique, the real witch, discredits Ben Stokes on the witness stand.  The  other eyewitnesses to the truth is Barnabas, who cares for Victoria, but apparently not quite enough to reveal himself.  Granted, he doesn't want to dishonor his family and traumatize his mother, but I still see a large portion of self-preservation in the mix.

Yes, Barnabas does torture and murder Trask for persecuting Victoria -- and I feel the ""Cask of Amontillado"" variation is more effective than the ""Monkey's Paw"" variation -- but this seems like an attempt to compensate for what should have been done.  Furthermore, murdering Trask is foolish because there's then no way to substantiate his written statement that Victoria is innocent.

We discover how dangerous Angelique is when  ""good witch"" Bathia Mapes is destroyed while trying to lift the curse.  It's a powerful moment dramatically, but I'm sorry to say I find the special effect less than convincing because it looks suspiciously like a close-up of a welder's torch.  It would have been more convincing if Anita Bolster had actually sounded like she was in agony instead of like she'd seen a mouse.

The bonus interview with Lara Parker is the most entertaining one in this set, being practically a one-woman show -- complete with candles and red tablecloth -- wherein she waxes poetic about the vampire myth.

The Sy Tomashoff interview is the most interesting from an informational standpoint.  Tomashoff discusses the sets for DS and how they were constructed to much higher standards than other television sets of the time.

Roger Davis rubbed me the wrong way by talking about his pranks on other actors.  He seemed rather pleased with himself, but if I'd been one of those actors, I wouldn't have been amused.  The interview with Louis Edmonds depressed me because he appeared to be in such bad shape.  I'm guessing this was one of the last things he did before he passed away.

In the next installment, Barnabas's arch enemy follows him to the present, and the modern-day version of another famous horror story begins.",1147910400,32,5757,5.034920634920635
