8500413,4,B006LMY070,"This hour-long tape contains 2 episodes from the 1973 Japanese anime series 'Fables of the Green Forest,' which was based on ""Old Mother West Wind"" by Thornton Burgess (aka 'Bedtime Story-Man'), and features many of the characters from that book.

The first episode is about the titular Mr. and Mrs. Quack, who were sort of 'guest stars' for this particular story, as ducks who encounter some obstacles on their journey northward. The usual gang of forest critters (Jimmy Skunk, Sammy Jay, Rocky Chuck) help protect them from hunters and the wily Reddy Fox.

The second episode, 'Peter Cottontail Changes His Name,' well, that's pretty self-explanatory and it's tone is more overtly humorous, although there is a lesson for kids, too.

The animation in these cartoons is quite striking and, at times, even beautiful, comparing well to the work of - dare I say it? - Hayao Miyazaki.",1323993600,,881,4.979591836734694
