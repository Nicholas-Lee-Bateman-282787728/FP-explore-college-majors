8323622,5,B0014D5PRU,"This is a really good video for learning to groove on the bass. I wouldn't say that this is a beginning bass video. He assumes that you have some fundamental knowledge of chords, licks, riffs, music styles, and basic time keeping. This is a great video for learning how to play groves in a variety of different styles. He is basically telling you how all the fancy licks in the world won't do anything for you if you can't hold down basic grooves. This video taught me how to really listen to the drummer and play off of what the drummer is doing. It has made me a much better player. I think in terms of grooves instead of just phrases when I play now. This video is highly recommended if you already know the fundamentals of bass, and want to become your own kind of bass player instead of merely an imitator.",1265587200,7,811,4.30718954248366
