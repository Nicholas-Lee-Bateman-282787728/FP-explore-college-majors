261949,5,6300218120,"I must confess off the bat that I bought this on eBay as a DVD without realising it isn't yet available in this format - the DVDs were burned and didn't last long :( Why this series hasn't been released on DVD is beyond me when you see some of the junk that did make it to DVD!

I won't review the individual episodes as others have already done this, only to add that the show is a hilarious send up of 1960/70s US cop shows, full of big old cars, plaid jackets with wide lapels, small guns, devious women, smartass cops, and a stereotypical scientist working behind the scenes to solve some crazy crimes. There are loads of long-running jokes which appear in each episode (Frank's driving, verbal trickery, frozen tableaux to end each episode etc). One of my favourites is when Frank and the lab guy enter the lab - the lab boy opens a door and walks in while Frank simply walks through a large opening beside the door. There is some fantastic inverted humour in the style of Monty Python, and earlier still, the Goon Show. My favourite is the following dialogue, when Frank turns up at the scene of an abduction;

Frank. Was there a ransom note?

Ed. Yeah, they tied it to this window and threw it into the rock garden. I've sent it over to the lab. They're demanding a million dollars.

Frank. Why are the lab demanding a million dollars?

All in all, this show is an absolute GEM. It is much better than the movies which are still funny, but too glitzy in my opinion - I much preferred the earthiness of Police Squad! The fact that they only made 6 episodes helps keep the quality very high. The actors all play their parts to perfection, especially Leslie Nielsen, and the writing is sblime.

This is probably the only DVD I own that I watch over and over again and still laugh out loud. I even invite my friends over to watch it - most haven't heard of it and almost invariably love it to death.

Don't hesistate - just buy this ASAP!!!!!!!",1146009600,,1947,4.361878453038674

261951,5,6300218120,"This review applies to both ""Police Squad!"" tapes.

Not that many people know about this show anymore, and that's a pity.  It is one of the most hilarious parodies ever made.  From the opening credits (where each week's guest star is killed) to the closing credits (which sends up the then common trend of ""freezing"" the last image) it's a non-stop hoot.  As others have said,the ""Naked Gun"" movies came from this series, but this is better than the movies.  They don't have to fill 90+ minutes, so it's more tightly focused.

When ABC ran the series, they never gave it a chance and canceled it after six episodes.  I remember a reviewer describing them as ""The network of the Philistines"" for that.  That's apt.  This show parodies the TV cop shows that were in vogue then.  You don't have to have seen those shows to appreciate this one, but you do have to pay attention.  A lot of the wit is in the dialogue, and it's like English humor, the punch line is not telegraphed and the characters often do not even react to it, they take it as totally normal.

If you lived through that era, this uproarious show will be even better.  During the late '70s - early '80s, producer Quinn Martin dominated the cop show airwaves.  ""The Rookies"", ""Barnaby Jones"", Cannon"", etc. were everywhere. This series, while great in its own right, parodies the style of those shows in particular.  The sytle, the way each segment is introduced as an ""Act"", the narration--in fact, they even got the narrator from the Quinn Martin shows for this series!

I can not praise this show highly enough.  Because not that many people know this show now, it may never show up on DVD.  The most likely time it would have was when the Naked Guns came out on DVD. but it didn't happen.  So if you have a shot at getting them on VHS, grab 'em NOW and treasure them.",1139011200,,1834,4.469879518072289

261955,5,6300218120,"""Police Squad,"" which aired in 1982, starred Leslie Nielsen as Detective Frank Drebin, Alan North as Captain Ed Hocken, Ed Williams as scientist Ted Olson, William Duell as Johnny the Snitch, and Rex Hamilton as Abraham Lincoln. The first three episodes from the short-lived but well-remembered comedy created by the Zucker Brothers are preserved on this tape. I have included both the title that appeared on the screen and the one intoned by the narrator (in that order). Oh, and please remember that the ""guest star"" for each episode is always killed during the title credits. Now, back to the episodes:

(1) ""A Substantial Gift""/""The Broken Promise,"" the March 4, 1982 series premier with guest star Lorne Greene (dumped out of a car with a knife buried in his chest), finds Frank investigating the murder of a teller at the bank. His girlfriend Sally says it was a recently fired employee, but Frank has his doubts. There is a great scene involving Frank trying to get clear about ""Jim Fell"" and an equally funny visit to the Dentist.

(2) ""Ring of Fear""/""A Dangerous Assignment,"" with guest star Georg Stanford Brown"" (crushed by a falling safe), has Frank working the case of a boxer who is murdered after refusing to take a dive. This means a visit to Jim's Gym for Frank, who ends up working with a real dog.

(3) ""Rendevouz at Big Gulch""/""Terror in the Neighborhood"" takes out guest star Florence Henderson (gunned down in her kitchen while making a meal and singing) before Frank and Norberg go undercover at a dance studio to crack down on a protection racket. I really like the fight at the studio.

(4) ""Revenge and Remorse""/""A Guilty Alibi,"" with guest star William Shatner (dodgers gunfire but then drinks poison), finds Frank investigating the death of a judge and prosecutor who are killed in explosions. The prime suspect is Eddie Casales, a bomber just released from jail, but Frank (as always) has other ideas.

(5) ""The Butler Did It""/""A Bird in the Hand,"" takes out guest star Robert Goulet (firing squad after refusing a blindfold) before Frank has to race the clock to find a kidnapped young socialite. Meanwhile, Johnny the Snitch gets a visit from a desperate Tommy Lasorda. I love it when the monkey runs around during the end credits while everybody pretends to stand frozen.

(6) ""Testimony of Evil""/""Dead Men Don't Laugh,"" with guest star William Conrad (also thrown from car with knife in chest a'la Lorne Greene in the pilot), Frank has to go undercover as ""Tony Dawonderful,"" a so-bad-he's-funny comic, to infiltrate a night club and break up a drugs ring.

Why on earth did this hysterical show not succeed? Well, apparently there were so many sight gags (e.g., the Japanese Garden consisting of Japanese people standing in large flower pots), that people actually had to WATCH the show, which, it seems, they did not like to do.  Instead they had to actuall pay money to watch Frank Drebin in the ""Police Squad"" movies.  This was one of the funniest television shows EVER and the movies, while welcomed, lack the simple charm of these episodes. For my money, Nielsen just mugs it up to much on the silver screen, although Priscilla Presley makes up for an awful lot. This is one of those rare shows that is as funny as you remember it being when you watch it again.",1114646400,15,3300,4.775438596491228

261957,5,6300218120,"I own both LaserDisks of Police Squad.  Shows how old school I am!

I loved this series - I was one of the (relative) few to watch it live on Ch 7 in Los Angeles.  Great comedy, lots of sight gags.  Just like Airplane, but on TV.

One of the great things is after you watch it for the 5th or 6th time, you pick up on a new gag, either in the background, or you suddenly figure out an inside joke.

My favorite was Peter Lupas from the original ""Mission Impossible"" TV series.  During one episode of playing charades with a mime (who was thrown through a window, tied to a rock) {don't ask, just watch the episode}.  Lupas blurts out ""Protein drink"" - a reference to the actor's involvement with health food.

I'm looking forward to the DVD, but at least I have Police Squad! in digital format.

261975,5,6300218120,"Where is POLICE SQUAD?

If any TV show is screaming for the DVD treatment, it's this 6-episode series that came and went way too fast back in 1982.  I'm not sure why there were so few episodes but maybe some extras or interviews could fill us in.

I was glad to see Lt. Frank Drebin and Police Squad reappear in the hysterical 1988 hit, THE NAKED GUN, but I was a little disappointed they didn't keep Alan North and Peter Lupus from the series.

I realize they probably wanted bigger names for the film and George Kennedy is great, but--especially now--doesn't OJ Simpson kind of creep you out in the role of Nordberg?  When POLICE SQUAD comes out on DVD, check out Peter Lupus' take on Nordberg: he always gets too caught up in their ""cover"" operations than he does in their police investigations!

I remember reading somewhere that John Belushi had filmed one of the openings where the guest star was quickly killed off and not seen again throughout the episode (Lorne Greene's body is thrown from a car with a knife in his chest and, probably the funniest one, Florence Hendersen is mowed down by a machine gun while singing a Wesson Oil jingle in a kitchen).

But I doubt that the Belushi footage will ever see the light of day--especially since I'd heard his ""death"" in the scene involved a drug overdose!  Just too sad and too weird.

But POLICE SQUAD needs to be out there.  Many of THE NAKED GUN's best bits can be seen in these episodes.  Leslie Nielsen is hilariously deadpan in every one of them, from jumping out to shoot back in the opening credits to the always-funny ""freeze"" for the end credits.

7806535,5,6300218120,"Just received the entire series on DVD today. It appears there is mucho extras such as an interview with Leslie N., Behind the freeze-frame featurette, Gag reel, various casting tests, a photo galleery of scenery, sets and props, a list of celebrity death shots, and production memo highlights. I can hardly wait to get home to view it with my boys 12 and 14 years old. I know that a ""special guest star"" sequence was filmed with John Belushi but was shelved because of his [then recent] untimely death. I believe it should be released along with any other un-aired episodes. After all, they have finally begun releasing Saturday Night Live in total season DVDs so anything looks possible

Good try by gagmeister Proft, Abrams

and Zucker, but jokes getting a bit stale.

Slapstick usually works best, first. Fol-

sequels:

bad. No, not that bad..."" Ode to Alan

North and Pete Lupis, whereever they are.

Altough we did see Spence Mulligan later

in Chevy Chase 'Funny Farm'. First three

episodes better than the last three. Also

better than Naked Gun movies with their

'recycled jokes', ""Environmental theme.

Zucker, Abrams, Proft went to the well too

often later. Nice while the novelty lasted!",1154304000,,421,4.9

Behind-the-scenes featurettes, new interview with Leslie Neilsen, gag reel and commentaries by the creators on select episodes. I personally can't wait for this to be released.

I like yet own NONE of the Naked Gun movies, but if they threw in these extra 3 hours in the box set I would pay TWICE the price they currently want for it.  Even though that would really, really, really tick me off.  I would still do it.  Zucker and Abrams have to have brought this up in meetings at ABC.  Know what I think the suits said?

7806541,5,6300218120,"It seems like whenever I revisit a TV show or movie from my teenage years, more often than not I'm disappointed. Usually my reaction is something to the effect of ""uhhh, what the hell was I thinking back then?!"" Not so with Police Squad! From Day One 'til now, these six episodes never fail to crack me up. I can say without hesitation: the day this gets released on DVD, it will instantly become my favorite comedy in my collection. While I'm a big fan of the Naked Gun trilogy, Police Squad! would have to be the desert island DVD I'd take with me....Leslie Nielson plays Drebin with more deadpan & less mugging, making things even more painfully funny. A MUST HAVE!",1147219200,3,668,4.483606557377049
