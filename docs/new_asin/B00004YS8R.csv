7927776,1,B00004YS8R,Picture quailty was very bad on Scrooge. Half of the time I could not make out the actors.  Beyond Tomorrow was some better and it was a very moving story.,1297036800,,155,4.166666666666667
7927777,5,B00004YS8R,"Marengo Films is proud to announce that the NEW VERSION of this great double feature is now for sale on Amazon. We have re-mastered both films from new prints and while our old version of SCROOGE had some scenes that were deleted our new version we believe is as close to perfect as possible with the missing scenes restored.

In addition we did extensive sound design and color correction on both SCROOGE and BEYOND TOMORROW.

We feel these are now the best prints of these films available and in the best condition possible. As always WE GUARANTEE IT! Your business is very much appreciated.",1137024000,4,593,4.6923076923076925
7927778,4,B00004YS8R,"I thought this movie was a nice addition to my Christmas collection.  However, my favorite version of ""A Christmas Carol"" that can be called a classic is the 1951 with Alistar Sim.  Second favorite only to ""Scrooge"" the musical with Albert Finney.  Any newer versions pale by comparison.",1102809600,2,287,4.9375
7927779,1,B00004YS8R,"I'm reveiwing the Marengo Films DVD with Scrooge & Beyond Tomorrow.  These are classic films, and the quality is fine --(Scrooge is scratchy, but watchable, and Beyond Tomorrow looks quite good) -- HOWEVER, huge chunks are missing from Scrooge, starting with the original opening credits!
  Originally, this began with an atmospheric sequence of someone pulling a book from a shelf and turning pages to reveal the credits.  This version just has a simple title card.  And the opening scene is a disaster!  The original film opens with the 2 charity workers coming to Scrooge's office and being shown the door a few minutes later.  Gone completly!  It's a deadly cut because it removes the fact that Jacob Marley has been ""dead these seven years"", that he was Scrooge's partner, and that he died ""this very night"".  In fact, Marley isn't mentioned 'til he shows up at Scrooge's house!
  Also, all the dialog about prisons, workhouses and ""the surplus population"" is gone, so when the Ghost of Christmas Present uses Scrooge's words against him the meaning is completely lost.  That's as far as I got so I'm not sure what else is gone.
  I have an old VHS of the film from Front Row -- the quality is pretty poor, but the film is complete.  It lists the running time as 78 minutes, this DVD is 61!  So -- good films, good quality, but too much missing to be worth seeing.  If you want Beyond Tomorrow, great!  If you want Scrooge, keep looking.",1006905600,22,1442,4.654761904761905
7927780,4,B00004YS8R,"I'm a die hard ""A Christmas Carol"" fan.  This little known 1935 English (Black & White) film starring Sir Seymour Hicks is one of the first talking versions of this holiday classic.  Digitally remastered from the best available masters the audio track is clean & clear.  The picture quality is that of a very scratched film copy.  Very dark in nature this is still a holiday treat for those ""Scrooge"" admirers.
The second feature ""Beyond Tomorrow"" (1940 Black & White)is a very nice surprise and a delightful story. This remastered copy is very good, both audio and video. The story is about 3 rich old men who are constantly betting on anything.  This holiday they bet if they throw 3 wallets out the window into the street with some money in it that no one will return it. One of the old men believes that there is good in the world & someone will return it.  And indeed a poor young man & woman does.  The human side of society capture these old mens hearts and the holidays will never be the same.
Good value with these rare holiday treats.",1005004800,4,1044,4.463157894736842
7927781,5,B00004YS8R,"I recently bought a DVD Double Feature from Marengo Films, that was billed as "" A Classic Christmas "" It features a 1935 version of Scrooge and a film from 1940 called Beyond Tomorrow. Scrooge is a version that I have never seen before, it is a British production and is one of the best versions of Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol made into a film ever. Beyond Tomorrow is a total gem, seeing that I bought this DVD only for Scrooge, I was happy to discover a film that is on the same level as It's A Wonderful Life. I'm serious, this film is great! Why is it unknown? The film is about a young couple brought together on Christmas Eve by three aging and lonely lawyers in New York City. This is a must for your DVD Christmas collection.  Hats off to Marengo Films.",976579200,15,768,4.260273972602739
