7928882,5,B000050HE9,I was really pleased with this video.  I'm raising my two girls (21 mo. and 3 1/2 yrs) in a bilingual environment.  This is a fabulous video - high quality and lots of fun.  Very upbeat and the repetition of the numbers in various ways is outstanding.  I wish there were more like it on the market.  Can't wait for the follow-up!!,1046563200,,330,4.258064516129032

7928887,5,B000050HE9,"I bought this video for my two year old son, and he can't get enough of it! He started singing along in Spanish after just a few times, and learned the Spanish numbers with great ease! This video is so different from everything else I have seen, and believe me, I own over 50 educational tapes of all kind. The video does a great job of teaching spanish in a very playful, simple way that children and even adults can appreciate and take advantage of. The fact that the video also has musical selections by Mozart is definitely a big plus! I believe that my son now has a jumpstart in his language developement. If you want your child to start mastering a second language, this is a great start.",974937600,,695,4.3538461538461535
