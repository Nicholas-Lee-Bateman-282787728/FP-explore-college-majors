8467125,4,B005DL6PDC,Reflects the novel well and is John Gilbert's final film. He is fine and has no vocal problems but it does seem as if they are not only playing drunks but living that way. Entertaining especially so for those who have read the source material.,1352332800,3,243,4.4222222222222225
