5185536,2,B008VNIB6I,We enjoyed the first Gingerdead man movie quite a bit but 2 and 3 are just crass in place of plot.,1398902400,,98,3.7142857142857144
5185537,4,B008VNIB6I,"If your a horror fan of b movies then your in for a treat. Gingerdead Man tells the story of a psychotic killer who has his soul trapped in a cookie, Of course  he goes on a bloody killing spree. The sequel Gingerdead Man 2 Passion of the Crust offers lots of gore and plenty of camp humor. This time evil cookie invades a movie studio. Do not waste to much time on the third one unless you like soft core porn but it does have decent kills nd lots of humor. Gingerdead Man evil cookie that is so bad for you it's good.",1397692800,,519,3.9903846153846154
5185538,3,B008VNIB6I,Movie was alright was a tad dissapointed. Movie was just a little less than expected but if your into low budget horror movies you should check it out,1394582400,,150,4.392857142857143
5185539,5,B008VNIB6I,We sat down and watched the whole set.  Ate in the living room right in front of it.  Very entertaining for these cold weather days. I would buy this trilogy all over again,1390694400,,172,4.181818181818182
5185540,4,B008VNIB6I,"If you're into hilarious, campy killer flicks like Puppetmaster, this is for you.  Mindless entertainment at its best.  Probably not for you if you're into Titanic and Sisterhood of the Traveling Ya Ya Pants.",1387238400,4,208,5.088235294117647
5185541,5,B008VNIB6I,"A brilliant modern classic, Charles Band brings to the life the Gingerdead man like no director before him. Humorous, edgy, thought provoking, and I think the extras are actually out of work strippers.",1385942400,5,201,5.121212121212121
5185542,5,B008VNIB6I,"This movie met the desires of a good friend and his wife whom I trust.  therefore I give it a good rating, and THANKS.",1367884800,,118,3.9166666666666665
5185543,2,B008VNIB6I,"A waste of time, too slow paced trying to have a story. The chuckie films already did this concept better.",1366156800,,106,4.35

8531097,3,B008VNIB6I,"Received the product on time and brand new in packaging. This was a gift for a horror movie collector. She loved it, but honestly, unless you are just collecting, don't waste your time. The movies were stupid and very hard to sit through",1497225600,,237,4.534883720930233
8531098,5,B008VNIB6I,These films ROCK!,1479686400,,17,5.0
8531099,5,B008VNIB6I,"Bought this movie because of the ridiculousness of it and was not disappointed. If you are looking for a high quality high budget movie, this is not it.",1444780800,,152,4.464285714285714
8531100,5,B008VNIB6I,Exactly what my daughter wanted......fast shipping......very satisfied.,1443484800,,71,9.285714285714286
8531101,4,B008VNIB6I,It's pure crap but they know it and make the best of it.  If you're a fan of camp then this is for you.,1431993600,,103,3.2916666666666665
8531102,3,B008VNIB6I,"OK so I love the original Gingerdead Man, it holds a special place in my heart.  The rest of them would have been better off not being produced.",1420329600,,144,4.142857142857143
8531103,4,B008VNIB6I,"Well, you can't go wrong with these movies.",1418428800,,43,4.5
8531104,5,B008VNIB6I,"If you're a fan of hilariously dumb movies, then this box set is for you! Arrived on time and as described. The first movie stars Gary Busey as a homicidal gingerbread man, but the third movie is by far the best. Any movie that spoofs on The Silence of the Lambs and Carrie gets an A+ in my book! There are a lot of hidden gems in these movies (mostly the great spoofs), but it's definitely worth watching if you enjoy funny ""horror"" movies. I'm beyond delighted with this purchase!",1416441600,2,482,4.366666666666666
8531105,5,B008VNIB6I,loved it!!!!!!!!!!!!!! these films are perfect for a b-movie fan,1412294400,,64,5.5
8531106,4,B008VNIB6I,"I'm happy if she's happy.

The 3rd movie ""Saturday Night Cleaver"", which is what she really wanted, made up for the pain of watching the first two movies.",1401494400,,154,4.5
