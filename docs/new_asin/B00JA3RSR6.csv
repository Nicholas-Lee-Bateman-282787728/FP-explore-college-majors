6349496,3,B00JA3RSR6,"This tv show is great.
But season 2 is less interesting than the first one.
The first season manage to show us the mythology of the Dragon universe without forgetting to talk about it's main characters and making them evolve. Hiccup and his father relationship was the core of this first season and the idea of the hate against the dragon was great.
Here season 2 it's more childish, more action, more fun but less emotion. More mythology, less psychology.
But it's still good ! Direction is great. It's mainly the voice from the movies.
Hope season 3 will more like the first one.

DVD are good. A box with both seasons and special feature might be good. Too many things to buy here and then with the tv show, the movies, the shorts...",1400630400,6,736,4.492537313432836

I did like the second movie, but I was disappointed that most of the Dragon riders were almost a secondary thought. These are of a very high quality in all aspects.

I got this during christmas when i believe it was like $5-$7! Pretty cheap..i also got her the other dvds to complete the whole season 1-2..its nice to see their life after the 1st movie and them adjusting to life living with dragons and not killing them..this is fun for everyone!,1421539200,,467,4.379310344827586

6349644,2,B00JA3RSR6,"My 5 year old daughter was excited to buy this with her own allowance.  She is happy with it, but I'm disappointed by the glaring video display issue.  Every episode on both discs has an image doubling/ghosting on the edges of everything.  It's most obvious when looking at a distant shot of a character's face.  One mouth above the other and everyone has four eyes.  It isn't my dvd player or settings, I've tested on multiple devices and have played with the settings on each one.  This is clearly an issue with how the video was burned to disc and since the issue doesn't show up on the title screen or promos, I have to assume this is how the episodes were recorded to every disc made in the factory.  It's unfair, but fortunately, my 5 year old isn't very discriminating.",1421280000,5,776,4.460992907801418

6349761,4,B00JA3RSR6,"Great Series! Animation is good, but not as good as the movie. Characters look like their movie counterparts & the Stories are pretty interesting. My only complaint is that this series is not on Blu-Ray.  Taking off a star for that. I did not buy a 1080p HDTV to watch 480i/p content. I have a 52 inch TV & the video looks somewhat blurry since it has to be unscaled. If that does not bother you, and you liked the Movie, then you should purchase these DVD's!",1404777600,,459,4.275862068965517

6349765,5,B00JA3RSR6,"We love Dreamworks Dragons! IF you're expecting the same animation quality as the movies, it's not quite as detailed. The stories, geared for a half hour show (with the occasional two-parter), are necessarily more simply drawn than either movie, but each one has some excellent character development to it. If you're a fan of the movies, the TV series (which will have two more seasons upcoming on Netflix), the TV series from Cartoon Networks is definitely worthwhile.",1404259200,,469,5.103896103896104

6349780,5,B00JA3RSR6,"I have to admit that ""How to Train Your Dragon"" and the TV series ""Riders of Berk"" and now ""Defenders of Berk"" are wonderful.  My grandkids love them but I totally enjoy them too!  Some very adult issues are brought out in these movies/series that I think are excellent and will hopefully help children in their later lives whether they realize it or not.  The new ""How to Train Your Dragon 2"" movie just came out 4 days ago and I will definitely go see it at the theater and buy the Blu-ray/DVD/3D combo pack when it comes out!  Great story-lines with fabulous animation...very impressive stuff!",1402963200,,596,4.59433962264151
6349781,4,B00JA3RSR6,"I was watching these cartoons with my 8yr old nephew every day after he got home from school and we both were able to greatly enjoy them. They are just as fun as the first movie was with the great stories and fun humor and if you are a big dragon lover like myself, it's a must for any collection :)  I only wish we had cable to watch season 3 as it airs. It will be a long wait for the season 3 dvds :(

My only complaint about these sets are that season 1 and season 2 are split into 2 parts each. With only 10 episodes per part, they really should have sold each season as a complete dvd. That's a lot of money to be paying for only a handful of episodes per season part :(",1402704000,,676,3.8214285714285716

6349784,4,B00JA3RSR6,"This is for the second half of season 2 (Defenders of Berk, not Riders). While the first half had storylines that were essentially ""more of the same"", in the second half we get back to the people. I especially liked the episode where Hiccup rants to his father about how to get his riders to work together-it shows that being a leader is not going to be as easy as the first movie would have us believe. And of the two types of problems in this series-fighting bad guys/wild dragons vs. becoming the leader of his people, Hiccup's real challenge is the latter, by far.

For those of you who have read my comments about the picture quality issues of the Defenders, part one dvd set, I just bought the second half of season two-Defenders of Berk on dvd to see if it had the same picture problem as the first. It does-the picture is slightly blurry, most noticable while trying to read the end credits. But this time it occurred to me to try shrinking the picture size-and the smaller I made it, the clearer it got. Just like with a lot of streaming movies-it loses focus/resolution the larger you make the picture. So for now I am watching it at about two-thirds of full-screen size, not perfect but not bad enough to make my eyes cross.

What's the contact info for the manufacturer? Or can someone else pass along this message? Thanks~",1401753600,,1335,4.467213114754099
6349785,5,B00JA3RSR6,"These Train Your Dragon weekly cartoons are very well made.  I like the interaction between the characters, and the problems that they face and solve in each episode.  The characters are well fleshed out, in my opinion, that is a feature you don't see in many animated productions.  There is welcome humor, and an equal amount of seriousness.  All in all, cartoons well worth watching, and definitley worth buying.  JRV",1401235200,,419,4.928571428571429
