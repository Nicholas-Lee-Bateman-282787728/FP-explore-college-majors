5932746,2,B00EPH8SZS,"With such a talented cast including Taryn Manning (Orange is the New Black), Wendi McLendon-Covey (Reno 911, The Goldbergs), Meat Loaf (Musician), Danny Woodburn (Seinfeld), Beverly D'Angelo (Christmas Vacation) and Eric Roberts (Best of the Best, The Expendables), you would expect a higher quality script. Nope. The only people who actually give a half decent performances are Taryn Manning and Tristan Lake Laebu in the role of the son. Everyone else pretty much just reading the lines. The jokes are hit and miss, usually miss. This had potential to be a great indie Christmas dramadey, but just ends up being unfunny and boring. It all leads to a rushed, contrived and bland ending that is ruined by a line from Beverly D'Angelo that undermines all of Cindy's character development by commenting that she'll probably go back to her old ways after cleaning up her life. It was just a giant missed opportunity, the whole thing. Don't bother watching it.",1413331200,2,956,5.018867924528302

5932749,2,B00EPH8SZS,"I was hoping for a kind of ""Sordid Lives"" meets ""A Christmas Carol"" but what I found was a poorly written excuse for some white-trash shenanigans.  A shame since it has some great actors but the end result was a bust.  Sorry, I really tried to like it but will probably re-gift or toss this one soon!",1388188800,4,300,4.245614035087719
5932750,3,B00EPH8SZS,"If you like this version of A Christmas Carol, you might be a redneck!

If you're trailer trash, you should be able to relate to this version of a Christmas carol.  It's a shame this movie is entitled All American Christmas Carol, because it's a shame that it represents such a significant portion of the culture in the United States of America.  ""A Redneck Christmas Carol"" or ""A Trailer Trash Christmas Carol"" would be more appropriate titles.

If you're into beer bellies, wet T-shirt contests, potato guns, dwarfs and kicking bullies in the balls, you might find this story entertaining.

Although this is not one of my favorite versions of a Christmas Carol, it is one of the most original and unique versions of the Dickens classic that I've collected.

Taryn Manning stars as a modern, female version of Scrooge.  Eric Roberts stars as the Ghost of Christmas Present; Beverly D'Angelo stars as the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come.  Meat Loaf also makes an appearance.",1387411200,8,973,4.819277108433735

8608088,3,B00EPH8SZS,"I have always loved Charles Dicken's classic, A Christmas Carol. I have seen literally dozens of adaptations of it and I still find it to be one of the greatest things ever written. All American Christmas Carol is a redneck take on the story, and while it wasn't a bad film, it wasn't what I thought it would be. Cindy (Taryn Manning) is a single mother, who has three kids from three different men, and she's not even thirty. Her drunken, partying life style doesn't even cover the bills to keep her three kids, Harley (Tristan Lake Leabu), Skoal, and Cheese Doodle in their trailer. Her life and family are headed for disaster, when Harley's father, aptly named Jake Marley, dies in a paintball accident. After the funeral those three ghosts we all know and love show up and try to put Cindy on the right path. This film was unrated and had all the makings of another terrific raunchy Christmas film. I was expecting Bad Santa, instead I got it's Duck Dynasty-esq PG-13 cousin. Kill Theories, Taryn Manning stars and she was great, she was far more believable than any of the ghosts and really made you feel for her character. The other stand out in the film is young Tristan Lake Leabu, who plays her oldest son, Harley. Harley is the man of the house at the ripe old age of 13. With the hilarious redneck antics going on around him, it's hard to remember that he's doing a man's job at a child's age. Leabu played the both sides of this character and did so with the ease of an actor far beyond his years. This is not your typical Christmas Carol, it's not all that raunchy either, but for it was, I was pretty entertaining. I wish they had taken it to the next level and really gone all out with the comedy, but still it didn't take that much away from the film. Rednecks let this film be a warning to you, if you don't do more than drink and have sex, the ghosts of loved ones passed will haunt you and it will be hilarious.",1419379200,,1930,4.349030470914127
