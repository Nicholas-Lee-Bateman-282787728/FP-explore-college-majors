7868902,3,6304372310,"Back from Hell has its moments.  Some fun cheap gore.  Odd sequences that only happen in no budget movies.  Love the juiced up soundtrack.

What keeps me from giving this movie more than 3 stars is the simplicity of the story.  Actor makes a pact with the devil, weirdo people keep chasing him, and his priest friend joins up to save him from these possessed/satanists/killer people.  The ending happens abruptly without a whole lot happening.  Plot kind of meanders around.

That said, this does have its fun moments.  If you like cheap old horror, you could do worse.  For fans of this genre, I give it a big OK.  Massacre Video does a good job of releasing this with some fun extras.",1460332800,,686,4.540983606557377

7868905,1,6304372310,"Some people say that effort is worth something in and of itself even when you fail miserably - ""at least you tried,"" such people will say.  These people have never watched Back From Hell.  I've seen many bad movies in my time, but this piece of cinematic putrescence has taken a little piece of my very soul down into the pits of hell.  This is the movie that will be playing continuously in hell throughout eternity.  I mean, this movie is awful in ways I never thought possible.  Usually, a dash of gore will make a film survivable for me, but even the bloody bits of Back From Hell are so fake and ineptly done that I really should be in a fetal position moaning in the corner right now.
Surprisingly enough, I think there actually was some sort of script when filming began, but it was obviously lost or simply destroyed soon after production started.  With actors as bad as those featured here, a script does seem rather pointless.  The film starts out with a priest named Arron (Shawn Scarbrough) driving out to the middle of nowhere to hear a private confession from old friend and current Hollywood celebrity Jack (Larry Dubois).  Jack explains how he sold his soul to the devil in order to become famous; personally, I don't think Satan himself could have even found this guy a gig in community theater.  Anyway, Jack didn't live up to his end of the bargain, so the devil has cursed him.  Now, anyone who looks him in the eye tries to kill him.  Arron has trouble buying this story at first, but then two cops show up and are quickly dispatched.  Jack then summons Satan in order for Arron to speak to him, and soon thereafter both guys are on the run trying to stop Satan's master plan, which Jack just so happens to know all about, to return to power on earth.  Basically, the guys just drive around and eventually walk out into the middle of nowhere, fighting and killing everyone they meet.  The ending isn't too terribly bad considering everything that comes before it, but it certainly doesn't help the film serve any purpose.
This movie has the worst acting I have ever seen; honestly, it is absolutely dreadful from start to finish; the main character can't even run convincingly, let alone act.  Then there is the gore; it's awful.  There is quite a bit of blood and guts, but it's all laughably fake.  Most of the time, someone is obviously just squirting or tossing blood on people from just outside of the shot; it never comes from the direction of the person actually being sliced and diced.  The movie can be hilarious at times, such as the scene wherein a hand pops out from the pages of a Bible and attacks the priest, but a little humor is hardly worth the mental anguish you will endure watching this film.  The only people who should even consider watching Back From Hell are people like me who are obsessed with watching unimaginably bad horror films.",1072137600,3,2881,4.537717601547389
7868906,5,6304372310,"I watched this movie a few years ago and I've got to tell you, it was one of the most ridiculously hilarious movies I've ever seen.  Being a huge fan of Mystery Science Theater I've had the ""luxury"" of seeing many cheesy films time after time, however this film takes the cake.  To give an example of how bad the effects are, my drunken dad was able to notice how, in one of the ""fight"" scenes, blood was faked in a skirmish between Jack and some pursuer since the Jack clearly didn't cut the guy's neck with his pocket knife and yet we see blood spurting out profusely anyway.  Don't think you need an optometrist.. yes I gave this a 5-star rating for its non-stop humor which mostly comes thanks to the almost non-existant plot. The most memorable scene from the movie was the ending when the main character Jack is killed by the black priest and he just falls down oh so ever dramatically with his hands clasped on his chest! It was as if this bumbling cast of high school drama class actors were forgetting their lines while it was being shot as well as their places in the film.  In sum, ""Back From Hell"" was just another cheesy horror film that shouldn't have ever become widely distributed.",1070150400,,1197,4.427272727272728
7868907,1,6304372310,"In the pantheon of bad movies, there is an uholy trinity of films that include Werewolf, Zombie Lake, and of course---oh dear God---Back from Hell. Firstly, the movie looked to be shot on someone's home video camera; this results in bad, unclear footage, and garbled dialogue---not that there's any noteworthy dialogue to hear. I think maybe the movie is a flashback, or something. An arduous, swiss-cheesed story about some dork that has fallen afoul of his devil-worshipping buddies. The devil-worshippers, by the way, look kinda like Lugo Men from Space Giants. Black masks, black shirts, black pants, black socks---I think you get the drift.
Special effects include:
A. An appearance by Satan himself (oh boy!) who takes the form of a crooked cop with a bullet wound in the head that bleeds from a spot of unbroken skin.
B. A hand wearing a purple rubber glove that jumps up through a Bible. I tell you, I was jumping up in my seat after that one. Yikes!
If you like bad movies, then, I guess, seek this one out, but be warned---it's even worse than Zombie Lake. This is only for those that are stout of heart. Or stomach. Admittedly, though, this movie is good for a few laughs. Over all, I would recommend something more like Madman for those in search of bad movies to tickle the funny bone. And at least Madman Marz isn't dressed in a black stocking mask and matching turtleneck.",1004745600,4,1387,4.688524590163935
