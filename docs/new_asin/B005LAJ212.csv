4817760,5,B005LAJ212,I downloaded this number one series on my new Kindle fire.  The picture quality is outstanding as well as the quality of the picture.  It was very easy to download and buy and lived up to the description given by Amazon.  I would make this purchase again.,1325289600,,255,4.382978723404255
4817761,5,B005LAJ212,"Revenge has an overall rating of 3 because it's weighted by someone who gave it a 1 due to the fact it's not available on DVD for purchase!  Really?  Come on.......that rating of 1 has nothing to do with the brilliant content of this episodic nail biter.  As ""Hamlet"" described in his/her review, it "" is loosely based on one of the greatest novels of all time, Le Comte De Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas, and given a contemporary spin"".  For every woman who was raised to oppress her shadow side, this drama gives liberty to embody the potential, and hauntingly graceful, mad avenger in each of us.  The only disappointment is that the producers hesitate to produce more and faster.  It's a travesty to pause in the first season of a new venture that is on the cutting edge........10 episodes do not equal a season.  Now out of spite this makes me want to take revenge and give the show a 1 rating, but I know better.....the content is worth the 5.",1325203200,,950,4.456647398843931
4817762,5,B005LAJ212,I absolutely love this series. I can't wait for season 2. Which I am sure there will be one. Everyone that I know that has watched it loves it as well. The Hampton's scenery is also breath taking. I purchased all the episodes and downloaded to my kindle fire and watched them on my bus trip to and from work each day.,1324857600,,317,4.129032258064516
4817763,4,B005LAJ212,"This is a female Count of Monte Cristo plot. I believe the quote ""Before you embark on a journey of revenge, dig two graves"" and philosophically, I think revenge is bad for the heart. I'll guiltily admit I love watching revenge plots vicariously.

I am a fan of Madeleine Stowe; I am becoming a fan of Emily Van Camp.  Henry Czerny also makes a great bad guy a la Clear and Present Danger,  MI and now this show.

I started watching for the fun (Hamptons lifestyle & revenge) story, but I definitely keep watching for the clothes and the decor. As I mentioned in the title, I've looked for Emily's casual clothes online, but can't find them. They're beautiful.",1323475200,,660,4.5210084033613445
4817764,5,B005LAJ212,I'm into mostly comedy ... But the preview intrigued me ...I watched the 1st episode and have been hooked ever since ..I highly recommend this series !! Will buy as a boxed set when the first season comes out ...Would definitely watch all over .. Peace Susan,1322179200,,258,4.51063829787234
4817765,3,B005LAJ212,"ABC's new series Revenge has three things going for it: the radiance of Emily VanCamp (Brothers & Sisters), the squeaky polish of an ABC Studios production, and an ethereal soundtrack that channels the moody tunes of Grey's Anatomy. Set in the Hamptons, Revenge is swathed in the pale coastal elegance of Wilmington, NC, where it is filmed. The show is Alias meets Desperate Housewives--a present day retelling of Alexandre Dumas's novel, The Count of Monte Cristo.

The story begins at Emily Thorn's engagement party, where a spree of deaths contrasts the sparkling socialite occasion. We then flash back to five months earlier when Thorn, whose name is actually Amanda Clarke, returns to the Hamptons to avenge the death of her father. One-by-one, Thorn seeks to take down the people responsible for his arrest on charges of terrorism. Swirling amidst modern-day-Gatsby social circles, Thorn finds herself entwined in conspiracies and corruption underlying the Hamptons faade.

Much of the pilot is shot at sunset, which enhances the show's brooding allure. The backstory is broken and revealed in flashback, adding to the mystery surrounding even the character we're most intimately acquainted with.  Created by Mike Kelley--whose writing credits include The O.C., One Tree Hill and Swingtown--Revenge will likely evolve into a nighttime soap rollercoaster. As it stands early on, though, the show is a bit of a yawn. Despite its various successes and mild levels of intrigue, it fails at holding our undivided attention.

Never underestimate a slow build. With that in mind, we will give Revenge a fighting chance when it comes out on DVD next fall. The recent full season order bodes well for an elegantly constructed first run, but if your DVR is already congested, save some space and wait to see if this one lasts.

4817989,2,B005LAJ212,"Very contrived, trashy show. Out of dozens of regular characters there is only 1 person who is decent. The rest are conniving, mean, greedy, backstabbing, murderous people, whose whole life centers around pursuit of money and ruining other people's life, or ending it all together.
The first few episodes were OK, but as the show progresses, it is only more of the same; more plotting, more drugs, illicit sex, murder etc. It becomes nauseating and I had to give it up.",1456704000,,469,4.802469135802469

Second, Emily, the main caracther has the power and ability to do and deceive, everybody with the help of a friend. There is no limitation and dificulties for them keep going with her plans. Boring, very boring. I bought until the third season at once, to give to my mother, who stays at home, but I regret every penny. Don't buy it, if you prefer some more intriguing movies.

4818062,5,B005LAJ212,"I was hooked immediately by the pilot of Revenge. It had everything. Great acting, exciting location and a well crafted story. Madelyn Stowe was a modern day Alexis Carrington Colby. Emily Van Camp was every girl. Your sister. Your neighbor. The girl next door. ""Emily"" did in fact live next door to the fabulous Grayson mansion--as a little girl with her lab. But then, her perfect little life was turned upside down and now she is back to settle the score and The Grayson's brought it all on themselves so there. The series has a kinetic energy and a ""can you top this"" game of cat and mouse that is intoxicating. You are given clues and taken back to the big flash forward in the pilot (which resolves in episode 15) about what REALLY happened on the beach that night with Daniel. It is a masterful episode and to everyone's credit they get props for going back and reshooting that entire episode and then editing it to make it look like the same day and not a year prior when the pilot was shot in North Carolina.

For all of its outstanding qualities in Season One, Revenge, I am sad to say disintegrated after the shows creator and show runner quit in a dispute with ABC and the show never regained its excellence. That said, This DVD containing season one is a must see! Based on what you think of this you can decide whether to continue on.",1445472000,,1348,4.435483870967742

4818262,5,B005LAJ212,Love this series! The first season does a great job of pulling you in and making you feel invested in the characters. It's also different than anything else on Tv. The acting is great and doesn't come off as fake or cheesy or soap-opera-like at all! Emily (Amanda) does a great job of being relatable but also very determined in her goals.,1422921600,,339,4.483870967741935
4818263,4,B005LAJ212,"First off, I love the show which is why I purchased the DVD set. However, I was really disappointed in Amazon's shipping. The DVD came with another item I ordered - a pair of slippers. When I opened the box, the little airbags they put in to cushion were all deflated!! So the DVD just slid all around in the box, resulting in a busted case. Fortunately, the discs are not scratched, but as there are 5 discs in there, I would prefer to have an unbroken case. Very disappointed in the packing for my order this time.",1421971200,,516,4.275510204081633

4818266,5,B005LAJ212,"Amanda Clarke is the modern-day equivalent of the Count of Monte Cristo.  With tits, ofcourse.  Just like the famous Count, her family was wronged.  Her father was framed for a crime that he did not commit.  And Amanda's life becomes one nightmare after another, bouncing around from foster homes to a five-year sentence in maximum security juvenile detention.  Upon reaching the age of majority, she is released from prison and meets a very powerful ally.  An ally that will help make possible her search for the truth about her father.  A truth that will eventually lead her to the people who were responsible for destroying her father and for condemning her to a miserable childhood.

Well, there would be no plot if Amanda turned out to be just the average Jill, right?  See, in order to get things done, you need resources.  The green kind.  The kind that opens doors and lubricates resistance.  Not even Edmund Dantes could have become the Count of Monte Cristo without access to funds.  The kind that could finance one's way into the upper-classes of society.  Fortunately for our young heroine, her ally just happens to be the great Nolan Ross, software genius, and the CEO of Nolcorp technologies.  With his billions at her disposal and with the specialized training she receives from a mysterious man named Satoshi Takeda, Amanda Clarke is now well on her way to exact her revenge on the very powerful Grayson family.  But before she can get to the Graysons, she must first get through the many layers of security men and hired help that the powerful family has surrounding them.  Having the kind of money that she has at her disposal, as well as the genius of Nolan Ross, Amanda Clarke takes on a new identity:  Emily Thorne.  A young heiress with too much time on her hands who decides to move to the Hamptons.  Disguised as the independently wealthy Emily Thorne, Amanda quickly makes allies as well as enemies as she carries out her plans to exact revenge on the Greysons.

As the saying goes from one of my other favored TV shows, ""keep your friends close, but keep your enemies closer"", Emily Thorne buys the house next door to the Graysons.  From this place of operation, Emily keeps tabs on the Graysons, working her way into their social circles and finally, to their inner circle.

The show is primarily made up of a terrific cast.  Madeline Stowe, Emily Vancamp, Gabriel Mann, and Henry Czerny.  Nick Wechsler is also along, playing an outsider caught in the crossfire.  Well-known and highly-respected veteran actors such as Cary Hiroyuki-Tagawa, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Amber Valetta, and William Devane also lend their acting talents to play characters that occasionally add complexity and depth to the plot.

I have always been a fan of Emily Vancamp since her performance as Esther in the ""Ben-Hur"" remake.  This will probably be her most memorable role, however, as the driven Amanda Clarke.  Gabriel Mann is the bi-sexual software genius, and billionaire CEO Nolan Ross.  Gabriel is one of the most versatile actors today, having portrayed Father Francis in ""Exorcists: Dominion"", as well as other characters very much different from Nolan Ross.  I am a fan of Mann, for sure.  Cary Hiroyuki-Tagawa is the very mysterious and very dangerous Satoshi Takeda, martial arts teacher and expert swordsman.  You may remember Mr. Hiroyuki-Tagawa as Eddie in ""Rising Sun"" and Shang Tsung in ""Mortal Kombat"".  Josh Bowman is the son of the Grayson clan, heir to the family's controlling interest in Grayson Global corporation.  Madeline Stowe is Victoria Grayson, Amanda's primary nemesis and ultimate target.  The very beautiful Amber Valetta is Lydia Davis, a woman who was complicit in framing Amanda's father, David Clarke.  Henry Czerny is Conrad Greyson, the CEO of a multi-billion dollar global corporation.

Highly recommended!",1420070400,,3851,4.968701095461659

I had watched for re-runs but was unable to find them so I purchased the DVD. The shows are much better without the commercials and have a slight pause replacing the commercials. My only complaint is that there is a review of the previous show at the start of each episode.

4818778,4,B005LAJ212,"This was a very interesting experience. When I watched the first episode I thought I was watching a suspense / mystery series, but soon I realized that was not the case and that instead it was a nighttime soap. I am usually not a big follower of this genre, but by the time I figured it out it was too late to let go. I realized that this series has enough mystery and suspense to keep me hooked, and the addition of some typical soap elements added instead of detracted from my enjoyment.

There may be times in which it gets to be a little too soapy. But these moments are few an far between, and that is why I only took half a star away from the highest rating. The plot is extremely compelling. Who does not enjoy a good story about revenge? Moreover, the way in which the pieces of the puzzle are presented works wonders in keeping us engaged and watching episode after episodes. the jumps in time back and forth are well crafted and do not confuse the viewer whatsoever. Instead give us an idea of where the story is going and helps us focus our attention on details to see if we figure out how we got there.

The cast is truly impressive, delivering praiseworthy performances. However, Madeleine Stowe shines above everyone else. In her role of the evil Victoria Grayson, she presents a manual on how to build a complex character and generate emotions in the viewer that many actors can only hope for in their dreams.

My wife and I have been watching episodes of this series non-stop and after starting the second season it does not seem as if the pace is going to slow down anytime soon. If you are looking for something different from everything else available at this time on TV, and enjoy a good nighttime soap, don't wait anymore and jump into this series.",1388361600,,1769,4.420245398773006

4818825,3,B005LAJ212,"First off- Season 1 is the best Season out of the 3 by far.  But even so it has it's imperfections. Emily is a woman with beauty, A huge amount of money- it's not mentioned how much, but it seems to be in the 9 digits and a very loyal friend who is also the king of computer hacking.  Upon learning that her father was framed she decided to make it her life's work to avenge her father's imprisonment and death.

Her father SUPPOSEDLY didn't want her to go down the path of revenge and yet upon his death he gifts her a box full of ways to go about it- including setting her up with a japanese revenge artist to train her in the art of vengence... uh...ya...

The main problem I have with the show is it's soap opera campiness that sometimes takes over.  You get to see unbelievable things like a woman falling over 10 stories onto the roof of a car... who ends up not only surviving, but also with no scars or noticeable disability.  The writers seem to make up story lines that they don't always remember to finish either.  One of many examples: Little amanda was much younger and shorter when the FBI came to lock up her dad and seperate the two of them forever than she was in the scenes before that occured.  Obviously showing how the little actress was older and had grown by the time they decided to shoot those scenes in the latter half of the season.  It sometimes seems like the cast and production team puts more time and focus on how good everyone is dressed, how pretty they are and how everything looks than they do into the actual story-lines which is annoying.  Still the show manages to be entertaining.  It's fun to watch and if you are going to see a season it should be season 1.",1381881600,5,1699,4.261682242990654
4818826,5,B005LAJ212,"When I first heard of Revenge, I thought it was another ABC failed attempt to rise back to the top.  But when I watched the first episode, I was hooked and I bought the whole season on DVD.  The result: it is one of the best tv shows I have ever watched.

The whole story is about a woman, who comes back to her family-home in the Hamptons and is looking to lay her past to rest.... literally.  The woman's name is Emily Thorne, but her real name is Amanda Clarke, and has returned to get revenge (title reference) on those who framed her father for a crime he didn't commit.  While searching to gain vengeance, Emily (or Amanda, whatever she likes to be called) runs into people from her past and also sets a series of events that will affect everything and everyone.

The summary sounds like it lays everything out in front of you and you think that you have the whole thing figured out.  Well, if you do think that, you are wrong.  This story is planned out way bigger than the summary lets you believe.  Yes, it is about revenge, but it way more than that.  I'll review a little bit more and I promise to try to keep my spoilers to minimum.

I really do love this first season of the series.  It was well-paced, well-written, fun to watch, exciting, and even sexy as hell.  The whole storyline starts off fresh (in its own way) and starts to build up towards a lot of things.  We are introduced to a lot of characters (who I will talk about in a little bit) and we also are given explanations to a ton of stuff.  We learn to what really happened to Amanda's father, David Clarke, and why he was imprisoned.  We also learn some really exciting secrets along the way.  One of which you will not see coming and will definitely leave you speechless and shocked (foreshadowing episode 12, ""Infamy"").

As for the characters, they are done really well.  The main protagonist, Emily Thorne (real name, Amanda Clarke) is not exactly the type of girl who you would call ""nice"" or ""thoughtful"", at least when you are the one being targeted by her.  Emily is a troubled woman, who is out of revenge and doesn't care about anything or anyone (which we see change over the course of the season).  While it looks like she happy on the outside, you can quickly tell that she completely the opposite on the inside.  We also have Victoria Grayson (the main villain of the story), a woman who has a more troubled past than Emily.  Victory is portrayed as a deadly woman, who knows how to make threats with a single smile.  Unlike Emily, Victoria is filled with regret for the things she has done (a small reference to certain betrayal).  We also have the great Nolan Ross, who Emily's closest and most loyal friend.  Nolan is more of the comic relief of the story and also the backup for Emily's plan for revenge.  Trust me, Nolan will bring out a few laughs out of you.  There is Jack Porter, who is a certain person from Emily's past and (sort of) a love interest to her as well.  We also meet Jack's little brother, Declan (who I swear looks like a more younger version of Orlando Bloom), who plays the love interest to a girl named Charlotte Grayson, who is the daughter of Victoria.  Keep in mind that Charlotte plays a big role for the season.  We also have Daniel Grayson, who is the son of Victoria and also Emily's second love interest in the season.  Daniel is more of the ""innocent"" boy who is looking to do something with his life and not have to be part of the Grayson family business.  And finally, we have Conrad Grayson, the husband to Victoria and father to both Daniel and Charlotte.  Conrad is the secondary villain of the series and plays a great role as well.  If there is one thing funnier than Nolan himself, it is the conversations between him and Victoria (trust me).  There are tons of other characters who play big roles in this story as well, but I think the series does a better job at introducing and explaining them.

Sense we are talking about revenge, this series really does live up to the title and the expectations that comes with it.  ""Everything"" is almost about revenge.  Emily's motives are for revenge and so is her commitment to it.  Her everyday life and thoughts is pretty much revenge.  Not only that, but some other characters get revenge as well.  Somewhere along the way, we see someone getting back at someone who did wrong to them.  People may be think that this series goes to far, but if you actually watch the series, you will understand why Emily and others do what they have to do.  Especially Emily.  Out of all of the people in this series, Emily has the right to do what she has to do.  Her perfect life and father was taken away from her and she spent the rest of her life in a living hell.  The little girl who smiled and loved everything was killed when her father was framed and put in prison for a crime he didn't commit.  Heck, even after he was arrest Emily was going through a living hell of her own.  The nightmare was everlasting for Emily.  It left a huge impact on her and it looks like it will never go away.  If you truly want to understand why she wants revenge, just watch the freaking series and find out.  With me, I agree with Emily and say that she needs to do it.  I know I couldn't live on or have peace, knowing that the people who did evil are living like there is no tomorrow.  I believe that if justice can't be served, then revenge has to be.

As for the ending, I won't say much about it.  I can't go heavily into it without revealing a few spoilers (if not all of them).  But I can say this, it ends on a high note and also reveals one more secret that leaves you wanting more.  In fact, this secret that comes with it is not even seen coming.  The ending was satisfying and leaves a lot of room for season two.  If you want to find out, you have to watch it, that is all I'm going to say.

If you do think about it, Revenge feels more like a Count of Monte Cristo story.  It has the revenge story feeling and also that dark atmosphere that the novel had.  Not to mention that Amanda comes back with a new name and a lot of money, which she uses to get revenge on the rich (or those who framed her father).  That sounds a whole lot like Edmond Dantes to me.  If you read the story, then you can see the connection.  Also, some of the small time villains fit the description of a few villains from the novel too.  I do consider this series to be inspired by the Count of Monte Cristo and believe that it almost lives up to it as well.

Is this a tv series that you would be interested in?  Well, if you like revenge stories and twists and turns, then I would say ""yes"".  But if you are the forgiving type and aren't really interested in vengeance, then I would say ""maybe not"".  Truth is, this is not a story about forgiveness.  Even Emily herself says this in the beginning and end of the first episode.  There is no forgiveness and no salvation, just revenge and darkness.  My personal opinion, I love revenge storylines and dark stories.  They always seem to make better stories and they seem to have something for everyone.

I really do love this series and I highly recommend it for anyone.  It will shock you from beginning to end and will never once let you go to sleep without wondering happens next.  I say buy it and watch it with friends or family.  Heck, watch it with both!  Enjoy it and just have a great time!

Hollywood used to be a fairly balanced environment, neither too conservative or too liberal, but today's programing appears to be slighted to one side of the political spectrum. Liberal Democrat!

As a lifelong Conservative I find this lack of even-handedness absolutely troubling. I worked my entire life and watched my 9th grade educated mother build a business from scratch. While working for one of the oldest Private Banks in the world I was mentored by a conservative man, in his nineties, who taught me that honesty with ones clients was worth more than quick financial gains and personal charity was much more rewarding than government hand outs.

While I dislike the political lecturing and labeling of conservatives as all bad, I do enjoy the program and lo-cal and shall allow myself a little more time to enjoy it.",1380240000,,975,5.012345679012346

4819027,5,B005LAJ212,"I received this DVD as part of a basket of ABC shows that I won in a local TV station drawing, that also included ""Once Upon A Time"".  I put off watching it as I didn't really think I'd like it.  But, after having watched most of the other series DVD's, like ""Once.........."" and Castle, and The Shield, etc., I finally decided to pop it into the player one night.

What can I say?  When I'm wrong, I'm wrong!  This show grabbed me right from the very start!  And not just me, but my picky teenaged son!  It's one of the few shows that he watches without doing something else, like playing a video game or listening to a CD.

The characters are simply fantastic.  Our favorite good guys are, of course, Emily, Nolan, Jack, and Declan whose character had some incredible growth over the course of the season.  There are so many bad guys, it's hard to list them out.  And there are so many sides to these people that you find yourself hating them one time and feeling for them the next.

The plots are so unpredictable that you just don't see things coming, yet they never get into the ""get real!"" category.  They always make sense.

My biggest complaint in the series is the way Victoria was dressed and styled.  It seemed to me that she wore the same style all too often.  You'd think with her money, her taste would be better.  She also needs to do something with her hair.  It's usually worn straight and boring, but when it was sometimes put up, it was unbecoming.  They could do something with her make-up, too.  It makes her look old and therefore some of the romance scenes, especially the ones done in the past, are kind of unbelieveable.

SPOILER ALERT!!  In the last episode I really thought Emily and Jack were going to finally get together, and was heartbroken when Amanda showed back up.  And showed up pregnant!  I thought the Asian guy said he'd taken care of her!  I thought she was gone.  But noooooooooooooooooo!!

Anyway, I have to say it was a superb show and I will be ordering Season 2 today.  I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a show that keeps you glued to the set.",1376870400,,2100,4.384415584415584

4819256,4,B005LAJ212,"I truly do love this show, at least the first season.  It captures a person's attention and holds it until the end.  Unfortunately the writers give away too much.
It is about a Woman named Amanda Clarke who is hell-bent on revenge because her father was framed for helping terrorists and then murdered in prison.  Amanda calls herself Emily Thorne.  She has a photograph of everyone who she blames for her father's downfall and as a result her ruined childhood that was spent in institutions, mostly.  There is only one person who is truly looking out for Emily and that is Nolan Ross, a billionaire who gave Amanda/Emily 49% of his company on her 18th birthday.  Nolan wants to help Amanda/Emily because her father gave him money from his personal account to fund the start-up of Nolan company.  Victoria and her husband Conrad Grayson are at the top of Amanda/Emily's takedown list.  Victoria is the only one who even close to being as manipulative and clever as Amanda/Emily.  Amanda/Emily engages in a relationship with Victoria's son, Daniel.  Eventually Amanda/Emily finds out that Victoria's younger child, a teenage girl named Charlotte is really her half-sister.  A good guy, Jack, who knew Amanda/Emily as a child and has no idea who she is now falls in love with her and pursues her while she is dating Daniel. For the most part Amanda/Emily just sets up the traps and like dominos, one by one the people she has set the traps up for walk directly into them and one by one they fall down.
What is clear is that Amanda/Emily's quest for revenge quickly turns into a quest for vigilante justice.  The writers obviously can't tell the difference between the 2.  The main and primarily the only difference is that people who want revenge don't care who they hurt, innocent or not, or who they have to knock down , innocent or not, to take down the people who they want to get revenge upon.  Those who seek vigilante justice do care who they hurt in the process and they go out of their way not to hurt innocent people or people who aren't their targets.  Amanda/Emily goes out of her not only to not hurt others who haven't, in her mind earned it, but she goes out of her way to protect Daniel and a few others who need protecting, not only from their direct enemies but from a few of Amanda's as well.
My truly big problem with this show is that the writers give away too much and insinuate, to some small degree how the show is going to continue.  Not only that but it isn't hard, for someone that is really paying attention, to figure out how it will probably end.
The writers show how Amanda was on a path of self-destruction until she found out and began to believe that her father was innocent.  That gave her a purpose.  They insinuate that Amanda will continue on the path that she is on until she somehow finds her way back, to some degree, to who she was before her father was ever arrested.  After that, and I am only guessing here, but Amanda will probably abandon her life in the Hamptons and find a new one where manipulation and deceit aren't a part of everyday life.

4819341,2,B005LAJ212,"Caution, Spoiler Alert!

As is, unfortunately, so often the case these days, the need to carry over a show into season 2 (and possibly further seasons) trumps all other considerations.
Revenge starts out with a neat storyline, it has a solid cast, keeps you on the edge of your seat and provides enjoyable TV entertainment.
Then comes the point - after the producers have ensured the continuation of the show into the next season - where it becomes more and more obvious that now
the primary directive is: keep the show going! Plots get thin, the story branches out in pointless directions and then culminates in a ""climax"" that is so beyond logic or common sense
that one wonders if it has turned into a fantasy/sci-fi drama. The nice SEC agent finally gets his hands on the incriminating evidence, harddrives and everything. He gets to watch all of it in their federal offices so he knows it'll be enough to bring down the villain on a murder charge. But wait! All the evidence is loaded on a plane and the plane explodes. All the evidence is lost. The only guy who made
a copy is the heroine's side-kick. Not the people at the SEC, no. Why would they? It would only have been their case of the century.
It leaves me wondering if they think we're too stupid to notice or too much in love with their show to care.",1365206400,3,1314,4.475

4819388,2,B005LAJ212,"So much of TV these days is just pretty people in peril, which is why something original like Revenge was so refreshing. Sure, it had the pretty people. Sure, they were in peril. But they weren't in danger of wearing skirts that actually covered their private parts or shoes they could really walk in or who was sleeping with who. No, the pretty people were in danger from a murderous vengeful woman who was going to utterly destroy each and every one of the people who disgraced and murdered her father.

Now that's a premise worth a look. Throw in a great cast and wonderful production values and, wow, a show actual worth watching. A miracle!

For the first 18 episodes anyway.

Then Revenge became what it was trying most not to be: a true soap opera. Who is sleeping with whom? Who is a scuzzy businessman? Who suffers under the family curse? Will Amanda/Emily find true love with Jack?

Yawn.

To these soap opera elements were added ideas pulled stale from the human nether regions of the writers as a second season loomed and Emily/Amanda was supposed to HAVE her revenge by the end of Season One. Instead the story got muddied up, soap opera tropes reared their ugly heads and Revenge became Dallas 2.0.

My wife and I sat though the first season. We will not be watching Season Two. If the show lasts long enough to get back to what it is supposed to be about, we might return for the finale. Otherwise, we're moving on. Bottom line here is that if you're new to the show and are chomping at the bit to see the premise pay off, you will be disappointed. If, on the other hand, you like seeing pretty people in peril from every cliche in the book, then Revenge has what you're looking for.",1364342400,,1698,4.443729903536977

Emily is by far the most interesting one. She's smart, sexy and has everything planned. She's always a step ahead and no one can beat her.
In this show you can see good vs bad and it seems the story is endless. Right when it seems that all questions are solved, there will be new info and it's not even close to the end. It is a show that you have to pay attention to, because sometimes you have to use your brain and do inferences as well.

4819715,5,B005LAJ212,I didn't get a chance to get into this show from the start.... I of course got interested in it half way thru the first season. So I watched some on Amazon or on my TV on demand.  I loved Desperate Housewives... but this is different. We all have wanted to get revenge on someone in some-point in our lives. Emily/Amanda really does.,1356652800,,333,4.285714285714286

4819717,3,B005LAJ212,"I really wanted to love this show. I watched the first couple of episodes and was pretty impressed. However the more episodes I watched the more disappointed I became. It just became more of a soap opera to me than a cool revenge show. Now don't get me wrong, it's not a bad show. I like the main character Emily/Amanda. I also like Nolan and Jack. The other characters are a little to daytime soap for my taste, especially Charlotte. I hope she overdoses in an upcoming episode because she is annoying as hell. Saying that however, I admit that as much as I wanted to stop watching Revenge I found that I was still interested enough to stick with it as painful as much of the stupid dramatic scenes were. It's too bad this show is weighed down with so much soap drama nonsense. It could be a really cool show. I don't know if I will watch season two as the reviews suggest even more drama and less suspense. If you don't mind drama this is a great show but if you can't stand the dramatic soap opera bull you probably should not bother trying to get into Revenge. A great plot is wasted under way too much soap drama.",1356480000,4,1118,4.278301886792453

Emily Thorne is one of the best written characters I've ever seen. One of the best things about this show is how it keeps you guessing.

Once the initial episodes had been shown the theme lost impetus, the story line proved untenable to substantiate a long drawn out series. It is difficult to keep enthusiasm going when the story line of revenge becomes diluted with episodes that really bear no relation to the main premiss of this series.

On the positive side the actors develop their characters and are the only real reason for continued viewing. The writers have to come up with material that matches the initial episodes in quality or they will undermine the casts ability to hold viewer interest.",1352851200,5,667,4.842105263157895

4820229,2,B005LAJ212,"Okay, I did a rare thing and watched a show I didn't care for AGAIN. Everyone getting onto me about ""oh how could you not like this show? Its about a little girl who gets her Dad taken away from her! (now considering that I cant stand kids, my reply is a quick ""Good!"" But hey, a lot of you out there don't hold the same dislike for those little pains in the butt that I do so I'll try to look at it from a neutral standpoint. a guy gets killed at the beginning. We don't know who it is they won't tell us. We have to figure it out for ourselves. We can only assume its the guy Emily is suppose to be marrying (they are getting married, right?). Then we see a little girl at a beach house (im guessing this is Emily as a child?)Then a bit later we see a video being played which again (assuming) that this is a news cast of Emily's Dad being arrested or whatever turns out he was responsible for some terrorist act or something that caused a plane to crash and kill everyone. The company he worked for turned him in and I guess little Miss Emily is mad about that. Now, theres nothing that I saw that said the guy was innocent. This is just something you have to assume. I don't like assumptions. So here you have the majority saying the guy did it, there was obviously a trial and he was found guilty, and he died in prison. Now, maybe he was innocent. Maybe he was framed idk. But im sorry I just cant get into this show. Too many assumptions have to be made and they have to be made a certain way. Im sorry but I need more heck a lot more than subtle hints being thrown out at me. I need more than facial grimaces and shoulder shrugs. I cant read a person by the way they hold their cell phone. Perhaps this isn't a show for middle age ppl but rather the 20-ish crowd. Heck the way I see it, if the guy was framed and those ppl had something to do with it, she lost her Dad and that family lost their son. Theres your revenge right there. It isn't going to bring your Dad back so just let it go. Youve both lost so now move on. Besides, Romans 12:19 ""Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.""

Like this show if you wish, but as a person that doesnt care for kids to begin with and doesnt come from a tight-knit family, this show just didn't appeal to me.",1351728000,4,2266,4.024390243902439
