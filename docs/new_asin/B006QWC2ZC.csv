5013983,5,B006QWC2ZC,"This somber yet deeply unsettling film managed to give me the willies even in the less-than-ideal Horrorhound Weekend convention setting.

Not soon after a pregnant woman (Katie Parker) declares her missing husband (Morgan Peter Brown) legally dead, she begins to having terrifying visions that hint that maybe she spoke too quickly. Writer/director Flanagan pulls off an incredible feat with this film. He manages to reinvent the ghost story,  then takes it to an unexpected, even creepier place.

Don't be fooled by the show-burn pacing, because the almost-suffocating tension had me squirming in my seat, forgetting to breathe.

It's been almost a year since I've seen ABSENTIA.  What haunts me most is not the disturbing visuals or even the deeply unsettling story line.  It's the mood.  When I simply think about the title, I hear in my head its stark, two-note funeral organ score, and my chest wells up with emotions not usually incurred by watching a horror movie: grief, loss and perhaps the most terrifying of all...the dread of inevitability.

Toss in a pitch perfect cast, including a heart-wrenching cameo from the always delicious Doug Jones, and BOOM!  You've got my favorite horror movie of 2011.

5013984,4,B006QWC2ZC,"Absentia is NOT the run-of-the-mill weekly horror release.  The cover art on the box may make you think to bypass or rent this, but I urge anyone with a taste for creepy horror and H.P. Lovecraft to purchase this ASAP.  I, along with so many lucky others, experienced this creepy, get-under-your-skin horror tale at a film festival and we were blown away.  It's a great high concept story expertly translated with a minimal budget.  The effects are terrifying at times while cast and crew deliver a nightmarish vision that may make you keep the lights on for weeks.  I suggest blasting this through your audio system to get the full effect that will have you jumping out of your skin.",1328486400,60,684,4.666666666666667
5013985,4,B006QWC2ZC,"I was able to see this movie in San Bernadino, California, on the big screen.  The movie moves along at an enjoyable pace.  Watching the acting was extremely enjoyable.  It's great to see a movie that is not all special effects, gore and over the top acting and instead relies upon the script and directing to make a good movie.  Katie Parker, one of the lead actresses, was amazing.",1327363200,5,383,4.507246376811594
5013986,5,B006QWC2ZC,"Going to make this short and sweet. If you are a horror fan, watch this film. You will not be disappointed. Saw it at Buffalo Screams Horror Film Fest last year and it blew everything else away with its creepy atmosphere and incredible performances, not to mention it is one of the best written original films being released into a market full of remakes and crap. Buy it!",1326758400,18,372,4.485294117647059
5013987,5,B006QWC2ZC,"Seven years ago, a woman's husband goes missing. But just as she's finally ready to stop grieving and put the loss behind her, he reappears. He claims to have been trapped in some otherworldly realm for all this time, and the only explanation he has for his escape is, ""It must have been sleeping.""

Absentia is a wonderfully written and directed horror film. It falls squarely in the genre of quiet horror, where character, mood, and atmosphere all contribute to a sense of dread that builds throughout the film until it reaches its ultimate nightmarish payoff. In many ways, it reminded me of the fiction of Charles L. Grant and Ramsey Campbell, which -- as a horror writer myself -- is one of the highest compliments I can give. If you're looking for just another gore-fest, this isn't for you, but if you're looking for intelligent, original, truly unsettling horror, you have to check out this film. Definitely one of the best releases of 2011.",1326499200,95,949,4.751515151515152

5013995,5,B006QWC2ZC,"If you like atmospheric horror that preys on your imagination, rather than assaulting you with shocks, gore, and not-so-special effects, this is the movie for you.  Some of the most effective horror has been done with very limited budgets because what is in your mind is almost always scarier than anything that can be portrayed on screen.  A glimpse of something unidentifiable out of the corner of your eye is more likely to fill you with dread than a fully realized CGI monstrosity chewing up the scenery.  I also find horror much more effective when it is not explained.  Explanation takes away the terror because it brings the phenomenon into the realm of reason, where things can be understood and mitigated or at least avoided.  Reason is less effective as a foil against the unknown.  The acting in this is mostly solid, sometimes even great.  Some have objected that the pace is slow, and it is, but a slow pace is important to developing a sense of dread.",1520380800,4,965,4.708333333333333

But when Callie finds an mysterious tunnel, that she soon links to a serious of other disappearances, all bets about her sister's hubby may be off. Meanwhile Callie is suffering from horrid nightmares/visions of her 'dead' husband.

A very slow burning independent film with above average acting and characterization that rings honest. Even if you were to strip away the horror elements from the movie, that ironically are the weaker parts of the film, I believe that it would still hold up well enough.",1520121600,,685,5.061946902654867

I was going to give it 3 stars, but went 4 because of the acting of the female lead. I think I've seen her in other things and she is good enough that I would probably watch a flick just because she was in it. I felt for her as she had to decide what to do when her husband came back.",1519257600,,441,3.752688172043011

5014010,3,B006QWC2ZC,"It has now been seven years since Tricias (Courtney Bell) husband is disappeared. She is about to declare him dead in absentia. Her prodigal sister has returned from who knows where to help her get over this difficult time. Other people are also trying to help her such as the detective that is looking into the case and a psychiatrist. It seems that shes seeing her missing husband everywhere yet he is nowhere.

Her sister Callie (Katie Parker) suspects otherworldly influences. And it does not take us as viewers long to agree. However there seems to be a normal (but stretching it) explanation for everything.

The thing that makes this film spooky is Steven King type plot that as always borders on the normal, the abnormal, and slides ever so slightly into the supernatural. Other people have seen a tad of H.P. Lovecraft. Writer and director Mike Flanagan carry this to the next level. After waiting the movie you may be more cognizant of your surroundings.

Be sure to listen to the tense background music that plays one of the actors without covering up the dialog.",1509062400,,1074,4.763440860215054

This is not for people that like basic generic vanilla horror, this is for people who want to be scared not by gore but by perfect storytelling and a foreboding creepy mood that hangs over the film from the beginning and never lets up. Don't read too much about it, if you don't know anything other than the premise that the main character's husband has been missing for years that's perfect, that's all you need to know.

5014014,4,B006QWC2ZC,"Its low budget and a slow burn but its pretty effective at building the tension and producing some pretty creepy moments.  The story and characters also hold together pretty well.  Not for someone looking for intense frights and sophisticated effects, but if you like moody, creepy, atmospheric then it manages to pull off the story and the scares pretty well.",1500854400,,360,4.983333333333333
5014015,4,B006QWC2ZC,"Tricia's husband Daniel has been missing for seven years with no sightings, no communication, nothing. She's about to move on with her life after waiting for closure for so long. Her plan is to declare him dead in absentia, sell their home, movie into an apartment, start a new relationship, and have her baby. Her messy, unpredictable sister Callie comes to stay with her and help her pack. Callie notices that odd things happen around this tunnel near Tricia's house like a deranged homeless man and then a cache of stolen objects appear on her doorstep and then inthe house when she leaves some food for him. Are these weird but explainable events or something more supernatural at work?

Absentia isn't a flashy or gory horror film. It's much more quiet, subtle, and emotional. Although Tricia is pregnant and ready to start a new life with her boyfriend, she's stuck in the past with her husband and the life they had built together. Apparently, they had been fighting and things weren't going as well, but the complete disruption of her life with no resolution left her frozen, waiting. Disturbing hallucinations of her husband with monstrous aspects plague her as she struggles to move on. Her boyfriend, a police officer, is completely supportive and willing to wait until she's ready to start their life together. When her husband appears at their home after seven years, she brushes off his appearance as another hallucination indicative of stress and guilt. Only her boyfriend's reaction tells her Daniel is real.

Callie is Tricia's troublemaking younger sister. She runs constantly and remains secretly addicted to drugs. I find it ironic that her Christian impulse to feed the poor is the thing that brings something monstrous into their lives. She discovers the creature who has taken countless people is similar to those in myths, legends, and fairy tales that eat and abduct people. Or there could be a much simpler explanation based in the real world instead of the mind of a junkie who is high whenever something weird happens. The creature (if there is one) is well handled. The film is low budget, so any large scale CGI creature would look awful. Only shadows and spindly limbs are seen of it in the periphery of the frame. It also lends to the idea that it may be a hallucination. While all of the concepts are not quite fully realized, Absentia has wonderful performances from Catherine Parker and Courtney Bell that make this relatively simple plot much deeper. It's not Mike Flanagan's best movie, but it shows his ingenuity and impressive story telling.",1499817600,4,2580,4.9016018306636155

If I ever see the front of that house again, I'll cringe.  It was so slow.  This story could have been told in 15-20 minutes.  They milked this for every second and it crawled along slower than a baby snail.  Was there a scare factor?  Absolutely not!  The scariest part was enduring this until the end only to discover that this silly plot, script and acting would probably get no better than a C (average) grade in college film class.

5014029,5,B006QWC2ZC,"""Absentia"" is one of those rare straight-to-video gems that is so satisfying you almost don't want others to know about it lest it lose its indie ""cred"".
If a horror movie requires a huge budget, well known actors, CGI effects galore and buckets of blood and guts then stop right here and keep looking.
This movie almost feels like a home video, which of course is a result of its meager budget, but the director Mike Flanagan uses this to his advantage especially in the dimly lit scenes where some of the special effects are more effective the less you can actually see of them.
The real stars here are the people-next-door actors who bring the dread to life.  The main character is very effective considering her limited acting experience.  She looks like someone you might know or work with.  She's no glamour queen, being rather full figured (she's also supposed to be pregnant) and plain Jane-ish and is portrayed as a very real woman who is cracking under the emotional weight of her husband returning after vanishing 7 years earlier, and having been officially declared dead ""in absentia"".
The tale that follows is quite shocking, with unexpected twists and turns that I must not include with out a spoiler alert.
This film is best watched late at night, preferably in bed with the LIGHTS OUT.

5014031,4,B006QWC2ZC,"A good effort in the area of low-budget. I tend to like the Shark Is Not Working paradigm (a tech problem that ended up making Jaws a far better movie than it was intended to be), and thus by not having the budget to creature-feature, this movie has to explore its characters a little more fully. It's a meeting of two sisters, both with their own problems, when the older sister is on the verge of declaring her missing husband dead in absentia. The film revolves around what we can know and what we can conclude, as there are mysteries, of course, and the possibility of a dark underworld where people go missing. Or is that underworld rooted in needing to believe there is such a thing, to make loss a little easier to handle? The movie goes for some of the easier answers rather than dwell in the complications of its characters that are otherwise nicely set up, but hopefully this one proved satisfying to its Kickstarter contributors.",1475452800,2,940,4.568047337278107

5014033,4,B006QWC2ZC,"As a low budget horror flick this is probably one of the better ones I've seen. But what is it with every Indie movie made over the last 20 years and the god-awful sound tracks? I mean, in terms of music, every single low-budget Indie movie must have the same weird guy sitting in a cellar somewhere tinkling on a synthesizer that went out of date in 1982 and the producers telling him, ""Oh yeah, way to go Biff. You've done it again! This sound track is freakin' PERFECT!""  All I can guess is it must be ""a thing"" in the world of artsy movie-making, like some horrid badge saying to the audience, ""You guessed it, Buster. This is low budget, this is Indie, and by god we've got a crap sound-track to prove it."" Seriously, don't these people know a few musicians who would be willing to sit around and come up with some decent music? How hard could it be? Poor Biff needs to retire.

There are some genuinely creepy and compelling moments, and the story held my interest. The problem is that the third act answers too many questions while ultimately not giving enough definition. The plot makes feints in the direction of ""Rashomon,"" but then forecloses the alternative interpretations. There seems finally to be no doubt something paranormal is happening, but what that is never really became clear enough for me to be really taken by this.

The actresses play their roles as two daughters: One is a recovering addict that left town, the other, a very pregnant single-mother-to-be. The story begins with the sisters trying to finally settle things after their father has been missing for seven years; gone without a trace. The father went for a jog and never came back. No explanation, no body ever found, no clothes missing from the closet, even the man's meager bank account remained behind untouched. The youngest sister exhausts the account to keep her father's house from being foreclosed. But it's time to move on with their lives, seven years is the the statute of limitations on missing persons. Then it becomes missing persons in Absentia; the house finally released to the siblings.

Acting was pretty good, actresses weren't supermodels...almost like they were trying to portray real life. Oh, yeah, they nailed character motivation. I haven't seen many horror movies that are this believable.

I was very impressed by HUSH - an intelligent and well produced ""slasher"" / ""home invasion"" film. So I decided to give this one a try. It is an earlier film of Mike's - but definitely worth the watch. While not as polished as HUSH - Absentia is a great film as it mixes so many genres into one thoughtful movie. And the acting is believable - especially from the two female leads. They capture their emotions so well that one can identify with them or at least ""feel for them""! There is a supernatural horror side to the storyline that is unique in today's horror films. What I loved is that it lets a lot of things up to the imagination of the viewer. It was filmed and edited in such a way that it is never it reduced to schlock, like so many horror flicks these days.

5014184,5,B006QWC2ZC,"Absentia is an effective shocker through minimalist means,working on a low budget and with a good cast of young actors. Tricia has been putting out flyers on trees about her husband missing for 7 years. Her sister Callie has come to stay,after wandering for many years, shes now off drugs and has found religion to help her. Tricia is pregnant and uses Buddhist meditation to help relieve her stress and grieving. She finally declares him legally dead in absentia. Tricias attempts to move on with her life bring awful hallucinatory visions of the missing Daniel, this is to be expected says her counsillor. Callie does daily runs through the tunnel opposite the house into the park on the other side of the motorway and she herself has a sense of dread and weird experiences as she traverses the tunnel. A detective is helping Tricia with the case.
There are links to other unexplained disappearances, people who just disappeared and were never seen again. The film does not shove special effects horror/gore in your face, it goes through fear, terror, guilt, and the uniting bond of two sisters, who are strong lead characters in themselves, building up true tension through their developing relationship. This is a film where you don't see the monster, and all the more effective for that, you stare into the darkness, you hear funny sounds,there are a few moments where you really jump. There is a quiet supernatural quality to the film, is the truth far worse than you imagine? Superb acting by Katie Parker and Courtney Bell; Dave Levine and Justin Gordon ably support as well as Morgan Peter Brown as Daniel. Creepy ,character-driven piece with scary soundtrack, written/directed by Mike Flanagan.",1461628800,,1704,4.961538461538462
5014185,4,B006QWC2ZC,"I can't remember how this movie made its way onto my watchlist, but I'm glad it did. It's a non-gory, intellectual, original, somewhat mumblecore horror/thriller flick with excellent acting all the way around. There are a few jump-scares, but the plot is really more of a whodunnit/whydunnit.

This movie mixes psychology, mythology, and criminology, and I enjoyed trying to figure out what was really happening. You'll see that the story is based on ""The Three Billy Goats Gruff,"" but I'm also mulling over the Freudian symbology of tunnels. I'm sure I'll make more connections as I continue to think about the movie. Regardless, I was on the edge of my seat the entire time.

Opinions definitely seem divided on this one; I'm surprised by the negative reviews, but c'est la vie. I hope to see more from Flanagan and the players.",1461456000,,830,4.879432624113475

5014206,5,B006QWC2ZC,"We watch a lot of horror films around our house.  Call us dark or gothic, but we love the thrill of a good horror movie.

This film is very impressive and it definitely stands out from the pack of most films being made.  There are great relationships here: the two sisters; the older sister and the honorable detective who loves her and who has fathered her baby; the detective and his partner, both of whom are trying to do the right things for all involved.

That's really what made this film so good:  it seemed very realistic to me.  And the tunnel which passes underneath the freeway is archetypally brilliant. The tunnel is a place we universally fear--a place of concealment and captivity and morbid undertaking.  It's an inherently scary place even before the film makes it scarier.

The overall story works very well.  We were scared enough we had to take breaks at several points to collect ourselves--always a sign of a good horror movie!!  And the ultimate ""explanation"" for what was happening was pleasantly clever, and again, intriguingly plausible.

But it is the actors who carry this film.  They all deserve to be major stars as far as I'm concerned. I'm surprised to not find more films with them in major roles.

The kind of horror this movie meditates on stays with you, and left me chilled and haunted, unable to move or speak, especially during the final act, and even after the film had ended.

5014233,4,B006QWC2ZC,"I must say, this film surprised me in more ways than one.  I skipped this film for years following its release labeling it just another straight-to-DVD horror that Id get around to when I had time.  I kept delaying.  After all, if you look at the DVD cover art you wouldnt think there was anything original behind that woman being dragged into the darkness.  In the last couple years, however, Ive been noticing mounting positive reviews of the film.  So I finally caved in and decided to give it a shot when I saw it on Netflix.

At its start I feared my original concerns would come true.  I recognized none of the actors and I could tell it had a low budget (which isn't necessarily a bad thing).  I just figured this would turn out to be some haunting story brought upon by some past misdeed of the main character, a pregnant woman whose husband has been missing for 7 years.  But this was nothing of the sort.

The story begins very simply: Callie moves in with her sister Tricia when Tricia is forced to sign papers declaring her husband (who has been missing for 7 years) dead in absentia.  However, instead of finding closure, Tricias inner conflict continues as she is apparently haunted by her husbands tormented spirit.

The scares and imagery are rattling and the atmosphere is powerfully off-putting.  But rather than being loud and scary, its quiet and eeriethink Session 9 (2001) and youll know what I mean.  Not so surprising, I guess, after learning this was written and directed by Mike Flanagan, who later went on to helm Oculus (2014; which cameos the actors of this film).

Character-driven and nightmarish, our story advances as Callie begins to link several recent disappearances spanning 100 years (and that of Tricias husband) to a nearby tunnel.  The film includes scenes with the book Three Billy Goats Gruff and serves as an adult version of the fable.  That said, this isn't a monster movie, or a haunting storyyet it feels like both.

And like a terrifying fable, we find no solid reason behind the disappearances at the end, only evidence of a cause, making this feel satisfyingly mysterious yet many will feel at least partially annoyed by the lack of explanation.  But isn't that where most horror falls apart?  When things are explained, or over-explained, or we try to rationalize a supernatural story with rules?  Maybe its for the better that it ends this way.  Not all horror is meant to be explained.  Sometimes, just sometimes, thats what makes it scary.",1428969600,3,2494,4.722222222222222

5014254,4,B006QWC2ZC,"This is another low-budget independent film that manages to pull off an amazingly creepy story despite the film makers' lack of resources.
The story revolves around a woman whose husband has been missing for months. So long in fact that she is finalizing paperwork to have her husband declared dead (the legal term is 'absentia' or dead by absence). However, soon after her sister arrives in town to help out, a bizarre event occurs; the husband returns. He is stuck in a disconnected state and refuses to talk about where he has been, but he is clearly terrified by the fact that he will soon return there.
A little slow paced at first, the movie gets good around the middle and keeps you on the edge of your seat until the ending credits. As a low-budget film, expect some substandard sound and acting. But what this film lacks in budget, it makes up for in suspense.

5014276,4,B006QWC2ZC,"To think that this movie was filmed in just fifteen days, and on a small budget .... well, it really had the look and feel of a professional studio production. Plus, the acting was solid, as was the photography and music and editing.

Ignore the cover of the DVD with the woman being dragged away. That seems like a marketing decision to lure people in. This movie is much better than the cheesy cover suggests. They should have gone with the silhouette figure standing in the tunnel.

The premise, without spoilers: Tricia's husband Daniel disappeared seven years ago, and she is about to have him declared dead in absentia. Her sister Callie comes to stay and to help Tricia find a new apartment. Soon Tricia starts having terrifying visions, and Callie senses something eerie about the nearby tunnel.

This is just the kind of horror film that you want if you enjoy a slow build of dread (like in Brad Anderson's ""Session 9""). There is this palpable feeling of melancholy throughout ""Absentia"" that most American horror features don't usually have. It is not a typical scary film that Hollywood puts out; it's thoughtful and it does not spoon feed to the viewer. No cheapo jump scares here, no gallons of gore.

I want to praise this film specifically for the two lead actresses and the tunnel location, which is a character in itself. Except for one or two unfortunate ""information dump"" sequences and narrative leaps of telling-not-showing, (and that's the fault of the script and direction)these women give two natural, quietly compelling performances (and it's a nice uninitentional (given the casting process) bonus that they happen to be normal women with average body-types). I often forgot they were actresses playing parts. The same can't be said, well, in my opinion, at least, for the male actors playing the detectives. For the most part, their acting is a distractingly stark contrast to the women. Especially the more aggressive one. (the other male actors are quite good, though)HOWEVER, this is nitpicking, when the film as a whole is so good. It's not perfect by any means, but, it's one of those movies which used to be called ""sleepers""; worth seeing because it rises above its faults. I especially appreciated the way the story addresses doubt and memory. And you'd have to be incredibly hard-hearted not to relate to Tricia's feelings as her plans get yanked out from under her. If you're not a fan of intentionally ambiguous horror, this probably isn't for you. If you feel cheated by not being shown ""everything"", you'll definately be disappointed in the approach to the dark forces at work in the story (I actually felt the film would've benefitted from one less flash of reveal). All this aside, when a small movie can make a simple bathroom as realistically scary as this does, it's way above the majority of horror junk food out there.

5014302,4,B006QWC2ZC,"For whatever reason, ""intelligent"" is a word you rarely use to describe horror movies. Maybe it's because writers think they can get away with slapping pretty much anything on a piece of paper when they are writing a screenplay. Maybe it's because characters usually have to do some pretty stupid things to get in horrifying situations. I don't really know the answer. And that's why movies like Absentia are as rare as they are pleasing to watch.
I'll let the distributors of the movie tell you what it's all about:

Tricia's husband has been missing for seven years. Her younger sister Callie comes to live with her as the pressure mounts to finally declare him 'dead in absentia.' As Tricia sifts through the wreckage and tries to move on with her life, Callie finds herself drawn to an ominous tunnel near the house. As she begins to link it to other mysterious disappearances, she comes to the realization that his presumed death might be anything but 'natural.' Soon it becomes clear that the ghostly force at work in the tunnel might have set its sights on Callie and Tricia too.

Absentia is character driven horror with a Lovecraftian bent. Whatever lurks in the tunnel near Tricia's house has been around for a very long time, something we learn as Callie--who has her own dark secrets in her past--begins to investigate. The terror is, of course, somewhat limited--it's not like the tunnel is going to move--but it portends a lot of horrifying consequences. If here, why not anywhere? Who can say what dark forces lurk just outside our doors? And where do all those people who just up and disappear go to, anyway?

Well worth the money and time, Absentia is great fun for any horror fan willing to put aside the faster pace and dumber scares of your typical scary flick fare.

5014303,5,B006QWC2ZC,"Don't let the cheesy torture-porn poster/cover influence your decision to see this movie- ""Absentia"" is not full of gore and naked ladies being ripped apart by monsters.  This is a well-written, well-acted, and utterly suspenseful story about two sisters, Tricia and Callie, who have to deal with the aftermath of Tricia's husband's disappearance seven years prior.

This is a great indie effort because the filmmakers don't try to do things that they don't have the budget to do.  There are really no extravagant special effects or gore, the sound effects are minimal and eerie, and the tense burn is slow and painstakingly quiet.  I did not see the ending coming, either.

""Absentia"" is one of those movies that draw you in with good characters and then make you cringe while those characters have to walk through Hell.  It is a dang good horror film, and more people should see it.

5014328,5,B006QWC2ZC,"There are those who don't believe in the intelligent horror movie. And to them, I say ""Watch 'Absentia,' if you dare.""

'Absentia' does what all good horror should do - makes us confront some of our most deep-seated fears in a novel way. Horror is not always about blood and gore. At its best, horror takes a common fear and makes it uncommon, approaches it with something otherworldly to make us see it differently. At its heart, 'Absentia' deals with the pain of grief and loss, the need for closure, and the fear of moving on - but it does so while scaring the crap out of you.

It's a simple premise - Callie is visiting her sister Tricia, whose husband has been missing for seven years, to support her as she tries to complete the process of having her husband declared dead ""in absentia"" and move on with her life. Tricia is seeing things in the shadows and hearing whispers, which her therapist convinces her is part of the grieving process in a traumatic time. Callie is also witness to some strange things, from the vagrant lying in the underground tunnel she jogs through who asks if she can see him to the movement of the shower curtain in an empty tub.

If you think you know where this is going, you're probably wrong - 'Absentia' is nothing if not surprising. And I'm not planning to give any away here.

'Absentia' sets itself apart in its ability to set a pervasively creepy mood throughout. From the simple concrete tunnel connecting two neighborhoods to unique camera angles to the underpinning of an unusual musical score, there's very little in this movie that doesn't feel off somehow. Shot by shot and moment by moment, the atmosphere of dread builds and builds. Very few horror films have had this kind of effect on me, but 'Jacob's Ladder' and '1408' both come to mind for a similar tone. In short, this is not a movie that goes for shock value or the ""gotcha"" moment. Instead, it gets under your skin and behind your eyes to get you where it hurts.

It helps that 'Absentia' features two smart, flawed, and strong female leads. Callie and Tricia have their issues, and those issues play into the story, but being the vapid stereotypical scream queen is not among them. Instead, these women feel three-dimensional, believable, and very sympathetic. To the last frame these characters feel real. It's refreshing to see a horror movie with a cast of characters I can believe in - it makes what happens to them that much more awful.

I learned in the credits that 'Absentia' was funded in part through Kickstarter, which makes me appreciate it all the more. While most big studio horror films are the same remakes and gore-fests time and again, this little independent project of someone with a vision gives me hope for horror films again.

'Absentia' is intelligent, original, surprising and sets a consistent tone of dread from beginning to end. It dares to be both scary and deep - to dig into our psyche and stir up the primal fear of losing those we love most.

No ordinary horror film, this. While ordinary is easy, 'Absentia' dares to be extraordinary.",1353024000,4,3080,4.638532110091743
5014329,2,B006QWC2ZC,"I just watched this movie and I was curious to see some of the reviews because, after all, maybe I missed something.
I know now that I didn't.  What gets me is that people are comparing this to something Lovecraft might've done.  I'm a huge Lovecraft fan and not once did I think of Lovecraft while watching this.  I don't want to give anything away but yes there is a creature(we really never see it except in the blurry distance).  What it is and what the hell it's doing is never really explained.  Are there more than one of them?  Dunno?  The best way I can describe this movie is that the director may have had the germ of a cool idea somewhere in there but lacked the funds to carry it through.  And therein lies a warning to any budding filmmaker with a minimal budget.  Work within your budget otherwise you have a movie like this with a lot of filler dialogue, 0 special effects(which it needed), and poor screenplay(written by the director).",1351900800,6,952,4.425287356321839

What it is is a very low-key horror film built around a group of damaged, emotionally frayed people whose everyday concerns blind them to the evil presence that is mostly responsible for their wounds. The reviewer who compared the film to the short stories of Ramsey Campbell and Charles L. Grant is right on target. The people in this film have no idea they're living in a horror story, and you'd be amazed what a difference that makes. The monster is never seen fully, but the damage is causes is viewed whole, and we learn just enough about its motivations to understand that it is completely inhuman in every way but one -- its capacity for bottomless cruelty.",1351641600,3,777,4.63768115942029
5014331,4,B006QWC2ZC,"And it's a wrap for 2011's ABSENTIA, the first entry in my annual Halloween Horror Movie Marathon! Funded in part through Kickstarter, this was a low budget flick that succeeded for the most part.

Tricia's husband Daniel has been missing for 7 years. To help Tricia move on, and file a Death In Absentia certificate, her wayward sister Callie comes to stay. Tricia's pregnant to well-meaning but intense cop Mallory, who's been working her husband's missing persons case, and keen to start afresh with him. But is Daniel really gone for ever?

Part ghost flick, part dark fantasy, this is a story about loss and how, as people, we struggle to deal with it. ABSENTIA is a beautifully crafted movie with acting that is at least passable, and at times stellar. The score is wonderfully haunting. In fact, the only thing I would say is lacking within this flick is budget; I'd really love to see it remade with a few more quid behind it.

If you're looking something different, a slow burn movie that leaves you thinking about your own attitudes to life and death, you'd do a hell of a lot worse than this one. I'm keen to see what writer/ director Mike Flangan comes up with next.",1351641600,2,1178,4.6

I finally decided to watch it tonight, and I was literally blown away. First and foremost, it is a slow burner, not action-packed. It builds tension gently and creepily, especially when the protagonist begins to see visions of her missing ex-husband. What really takes this movie over the top is the acting. I was amazed at how talented the entire cast was in making a strange tale so believable. Part of what I think really appealed to me -- and made my skin crawl -- was the setting. I used to live in San Diego, and the tunnel featured in this film was familiar, reminding me of my own experiences walking past homeless men and women, holding my breath until I arrived at the other end. The tone of the movie also reminded me of a 90s movie called ""Urbania."" If you are into ""creepy"" rather than ""scary"" movies, this one might appeal to you.",1351123200,4,974,4.416666666666667

Absentia was the biggest waste of time I've ever sat down and watched.  Thank God I just downloaded it on Netflix and didn't pay for it.  But I still would like my 90 minutes back.

Anybody who is giving this a glowing review clearly either had a friend in it or helped make it, because I've had friends make better films when they were in high school.

5014334,1,B006QWC2ZC,"The first drawback to Absentia that really hits home is the way the movie is shot.  It looks horrible.  The outdoor shots look no worse than a Lifetime original movie, but the indoor shots look like they were filmed in Gacy's crawlspace.  If this were a student film I'd be willing to applaud the effort, but as a film distributed for the masses, I expected more.  As such, the look of the film is enough to take the viewer out of the experience of watching a movie.  Even worse, a big portion of the movie is just characters talking to each other, often about personal problems and such that have little to no bearing on the overarching plot.

By the time Absentia finally started to pick up and go somewhere, it was too late.  It's just dull, lifeless and uninteresting and really hard to sit through start to finish.  The ending was also incredibly disappointing; maybe if the ending was amazing it could have redeemed the movie somewhat, but it leaves a hollow, empty shell.

It's best to go in knowing nothing so everything is a surprise and each layer of the movie can have its full impact. For those who are going to read anyway, this part of the review is completely spoiler-free.  Anyone considering the flick should know ahead of time that the cover art is amazingly misleading. This is not a slasher movie of any kind, and while it may qualify for the tag ""low-budget,"" it's definitely not your typical direct-to-DVD terrible B horror movie.

With the possible exception of one detective character, the acting is very strong and really carries the movie. ""Absentia"" has an understated quality to its horror themes, which is overall actually very benign and deals with loss and the unknown more than anything that goes bump in the night.  A strength of the film is that several different options are presented from different character's view points as to what actually is happening.  Much like ""The Last Exorcism,"" two people can watch the movie and one will come away thinking something supernatural must have happened, while the other will be convinced everything is perfectly explainable by normal events.

If you choose to believe the supernatural version, then this movie deserves to be called ""Lovecraftian."" Not in the common sense of the term meaning slimy tentacled things, but rather in the sense that the horror is cosmic in nature, utterly alien to human understanding, and completely impossible for the protagonists to overcome.

This next part of the review is now going to be filled with massive spoilers, so stop reading here until you've seen ""Absentia."" After having seen the movie multiple times now, it seems to me the most likely course of events is that Walter's son kidnapped Danny, and then kept both Walter and Danny prisoner underground for years. Somehow they managed to escape, but they were delirious from dehydration, malnutrition, and an utter lack of human contact for years.

Meanwhile, the main character Tricia is suffering a breakdown due to mounting bills, the guilt of being pregnant when she doesn't know what happened to her husband , and the stress of having Danny declared legally dead without an explanation of his disappearance. Coupled with pregnancy hormones, this breakdown causes her to experience visual and auditory hallucinations. What's interesting is that this seems to be only the explanation for this segment of the movie - the filmmakers seem to make a point that the woman seeing the ""ghost"" of her husband is completely non-supernatural, even if there are really monsters from another dimension later on. This fact makes me think the rest of the movie is meant to be followed in a non-supernatural fashion as well.

After escaping, Danny makes his way home to find his wife clearly pregnant. After seeing his wife kiss the detective, he either runs away or is re-kidnapped by Walter's son, who has already previously broken into the house looking for his escaped victim.  The bug creatures are clearly just a hallucination brought on by Callie's abuse of hard drugs. Watching the movie through a second time you'll notice she only starts to see the strange things in the bathroom after taking the drugs, and her hallucinations start with a bug in the sink - just as her previous breakdowns had in the movie's back story. No one else ever sees these creatures, and they are just her way of dealing with what's going on. The scene where she is attacked in the bathroom may have been real however, as the form that jumps out of the shower is human, not bug-like, and may have been Walter's son coming to reclaim his victim. After her husband goes missing for a second time and her sister goes back on the drugs, Tricia gives up her current life and decides to just disappear and start over.

There's only really one aspect of the movie that makes it seem like the bug monsters are real, which is when Walter's son shows up at the crime scene with a dog in a bag, apparently as some sort of sacrifice to appease the monsters. But considering how everything else pretty much points to a human monster being the cause of it all, personally I think this was just a red herring.

With strong acting, great atmospheric music, and a slick but understated style, ""Absentia"" is a horror gem that's well worth checking out. The multiple possible answers to all the questions also makes it a real conversation starter and a great flick to watch in the dark with some of your horror loving friends.",1344902400,2,4557,4.829487179487179
5014341,4,B006QWC2ZC,"""Absentia"" is a film which requires that the viewer be open to suggestion of a very subtle sort.  Made on what I suspect was a shoestring budget, it reminded me of some particularly eerie stories by Robert Aickman or Ramsey Campbell.  The two central characters, Callie (Katie Parker) and Trisha (Courtney Bell), are estranged sisters who reunite when Callie decides it's finally time to declare her husband Daniel officially dead (""in absentia"", as it's called)  instead of missing.  Callie, a recovering drug addict, returns home to be with her sister during this stressful time.  And boy, do things get stressful.

At first Trisha seems fine and it's revealed that she's pregnant.  Her love interest is a cop who'd been following Daniel's case from the beginning and is probably relieved Trisha's let Daniel go.  The thing that's so unnerving about the film is that precisely the things you would find the most horrifying personally happen and they happen in a *believable* way.  When Trisha and the cop are making out in a car, an emaciated and pale Daniel shows up at her house, looking more like a four time victim of the holocaust than a healthy human being.  He is pale, livid, and panicked about something that happened in the tunnel he claims to have been staying at for the past 3 years.  This is when the teeth of the film really grow.  Callie notices during her morning jogs that there's a sort of brothership in the tunnels, a demented link between these vagrants she encounters.  She traces back the history of the tunnel Daniel emerged from and finds that it has an odd history of disappearances.

5014342,4,B006QWC2ZC,"If you've read my reviews, you'd know that I love independent low-budget movies. Most of the time, however, money spent on them could've been money that I could have saved. All too often; plots of the movies are, basically, regurgitated material from other movies with amateur acting at best. Most movies are worth watching only once and forgotten about. What's weird is that, even though Absentia is low-budget with above-average acting, Absentia is one of those movies you might want to watch a second or third time through. Like another reviewer who posted on this same movie, days later after seeing the movie, I still think about it. Despite its' low-budget, it's not your run-of-the-mill flick. Character, mood, and atmosphere are the three key things that really drive this film and, needless to say, the movie really got under my skin.

The story is about a woman named Tricia, who's husband is missing. Seven years pass and, just when she's ready to move on with what's left of her life, He reappears in a tunnel. Her sister, Callie, who's there to support her soon realizes that there's a connection between the tunnel and several encounters that's happend near it. Make no mistake, though, it might not be much of a plotline but it sure comes to one satisfying(albeit confusing) conclusion..believe me.

Absentia is an exceptionally written and directed psychological horror movie. I'm really impressed with it, like everyone else. I really enjoyed it, even though I'm still trying to figure it out(lol).",1343865600,,1515,5.007936507936508
5014343,4,B006QWC2ZC,"It's wonderful and surprising to happen on a movie that actually uses characterization, acting and atmosphere, rather than buckets of gore and special effects, to create suspense and horror.  Absentia is that movie.  The acting at first, in the initial scenes between the two sisters, felt a little forced, but the actors quickly fell into their roles.

This movie is more notable for the *absence* of what you expect to see -- massive special effects, explicit gore, spoon-fed explanations -- that characterize today's horror movies, and you find yourself continually and distractingly surprised that the movie actually achieves more without them than it would have with them.  You find yourself cynically marvelling that you're actually shivering at a CGI-less scene.  Just the *hint* of what the creature looks like is far more effective than actually showing the thing in graphic detail would be, because they show just enough to make your imagination fill in the blanks from your own fears and squick-zone.  This movie does that a lot -- show you a little but make you imagine a LOT, and therein lies the true fear.

Watch this movie.  You may never walk through a tunnel again.",1343865600,,1183,5.0
5014344,3,B006QWC2ZC,"The premise is fairly simple. A wife, Tricia, who has been in search of her MIA husband for seven years finally decides to move on and file a report pretty much declaring her husband as dead...the legalese being 'in absentia'. She's also pregnant (the father being the detective who was put on the case to find her missing husband), which is another reason she's trying to move on by finally closing one chapter of her past. However, after the arrival of her sister, Callie, as support for the process, the MIA husband mysteriously re-appears with no answers as to where he's been, only that 'it's after him'. Callie begins to realize that there is a strange connection between the tunnel that exists in the area, and several encounters near it and her brother-in-law's fearful reference to the tunnel.

While Absentia isn't a perfect horror movie or completely original, it's a solid, insinuating, creepy, semi-supernatural and subtle B-type movie. Just keep an open mind. Is it slow? Yes. Is the plot asking a lot from you? Sure. Do you have to fill in a few things yourself? Yes. Does it explain anything? No but I didn't mind. Explanations/revelations can sometimes make the movie lame and hackneyed but this movie doesn't really answer anything at all but I almost--almost--don't mind because there were other parts that did enough for me. Absentia doesn't have any gore or violence, just eerie music, a sepia-like color to the picture and some very good special effects for a low-budget indie flick and even a few places to make you jump. It's got some tight suspenseful scenes I appreciated and I thought the acting was pretty good. You don't really get too personal with the characters despite it being a mostly character-driven film. There isn't a lot of dialogue, so you have to watch the actors and what's going on AROUND them, which means paying attention closely.

5014358,4,B006QWC2ZC,"Very Creepy and Original
I really liked Absentia. This modern horror movie uses tension and creepy imagery to create an original vision. Some may dislike the slow pacing, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.

What did I like? Absentia uses the slow pace to tell a fairly original story and create a tense setting. I didn't expect most of the scares and got some goosebumps during others. It didn't need gore or loud music to scare. This movie is genuinely scary! The ending was also good. And I also liked the music.

What did I dislike? Some forced/poor dialogue. Some mediocre acting. Also, Absentia loses some steam towards the second half; there aren't as many scares and it generally wasn't as great as the first half.

If you love horror films, especially slow paced creepers, you'll most likely enjoy Absentia. If you have Netflix Streaming, it available as of 7/10/12 (in HD)  I highly recommend it.

My gripe against most big ""horror"" movies is that they are wall-to-wall gorefests which are excuses for the special effects crew to show off while any plot and characterization go right out the window; this movie did not fall prey to that mistake.

In this movie it kept the focus on where it should be, on the characters and the story while keeping the special effects to a minimum.  There were a few scary moments, but mostly the film worked on creating an atmosphere of menace, which was doubly effective given the urban setting.  The major movie studios need to take note; this is how you make a scary movie.",1340928000,,764,4.397163120567376

Yawned through ""The Exorcist"" (read the book first), laughed out loud at ""Blair Witch Project"" (I lived in the woods when I was a kid), etc.  ""Absentia"" was the FIRST film to really scare me to the point of nightmares.  I still have trouble walking alone at night, esp. around a creepy natural tunnel in my home town.  I thought the entire production was minimalist but definitely on target for chills, without any of the usual ""trappings"" put into modern horror films.  ""Daniel"" was especially creepy, and I had to watch it several times to understand the meaning of his several presences in the film.

She can spout off about ""dark matter"" and ""tangential universes."" Tricia's husband Daniel(Morgan Peter Brown) has been missing for seven years. She is having him declared dead in absentia. She is also pregnant (do the math) and odds on favorite the kid will be as bald as Detective Mallory (Dave Levine) the man investigating the case.

Callie comes to visit her sister as the fateful day of declaring Daniel dead has arrived. She will help her sister move on. Callie likes to jog and when she does, she passes under a tunnel located under the highway. As she does, odd things start to happen. Like a good horror/mystery/thriller it starts out slow and builds up.

There are a few negatives on this film, first and foremost was the soundtrack. It was second tier all the way, especially during those sad scenes which ran way too long. There were a number of times I thought Courtney Bell forgot what role she was playing. And the third thing was the boom mike visible in the upper right hand corner in a midway scene that involves Callie walking into the bathroom. While the actual image on the DVD cover did not appear in this feature it was thematically correct.

Since the DVD box didn't say anything more about the plot, I won't spoil it because it is worth a view. If you enjoy odd missing persons films, you might like, ""Yellow Brick Road"" which I though was superior to this story.

(1.) Misleading DVD cover. Didn't look like that in the movie and such scenes occurred just a couple of times for maybe a second or two.
(2.) No subtitles for either English hard of hearing or Spanish speakers. First sign of cheap.
(3.) Almost 400 special thanks contributors. Second sign of cheap budget.
(4.) Usual reliance upon missing people newspaper clippings (this is getting so old) to tell our story of suspense. Usual reliance on the same scene shown over and over and over as a obvious suggestive clue - in this case a long walk through tunnel with the obligatory white light at the end and spiders with their webs.
(5.) Special effects consist of fabric representing a solid wall and someone pushing from the opposite side to represent someone's inside the wall. Usual underground beings snatching a human every so often. Underground beings appear in very brief flashes (about one second) as sort of spider like. Usual cheap dragging of a person who seems to be capable of nothing but briefly grabbing the ground or some post. Total number of scenes with effects is around four and total time allocated about one minute. Usual ghost image or illusions showing up every so often to scare the viewer. Really just looks like someone at Halloween with bad makeup.
(6.) Usual scene of girl in bathroom with moving closed shower curtain -  nothing there, just a dirty bathtub. Who keeps their shower curtains closed all the way anyway?
(7.) Usual dumb cops. If I was a national union for police officers I would sue Hollywood for how frequently cops are portrayed in similar negative ways.
(8.) To explain how beings can live in a suburb we are given the middle school chemistry lecturer hook that matter (atoms) are just 90+% empty. So beings can live in those spaces. The problem is: Somehow the forces within those atoms wouldn't allow it and it wouldn't feel so good.
Positives:
(1.) Good to see non-cookie cutter looking actors.
(2.) Naturalistic acting. Sort of winging it which is what makes the movie tolerable given the storyline is so weak.

5014371,4,B006QWC2ZC,"I must preface this by saying that I am an independent horror filmmaker myself.  This might make me more biased.  I probably hold indie films to a different standard than studio films.

That aside, I found Absentia very enjoyable.  After seeing it take last year's awards at many of the festivals I just entered my own film in for the 2012 round, I thought I would give it a shot and I am truly glad that I did.  This movie certainly kept my interest throughout without being riddled with a lot of special effects.  It relied more on plot and creative camera work which I really enjoyed.

My favorite part of this film is that the creators didn't follow suit with these terrible indie horror films like ""Creature"" by showing too much of the monster, or showing it in too bright light.  You hear it, you see that something is there, but they never show what it looks like.  However, they do provide lots of great scares throughout the whole first act when the wife begins to experience the evil-looking version of her missing husband.  I found these scares to be very creepy and enjoyable.

My only beef with the film is that I watched it on surround sound and there is this intermittent bass noise throughout the movie that is supposed to create some sort of eerie tension but instead it is so loud and so constant that I missed two entire scenes of dialogue completely.  It would have been like watching a silent film in those scenes if not for the fact that the noise was so loud it was shaking everything in my house.

All in all I felt that Absentia was a really great, really creative film. I hope that the creators of Absentia will continue to make creepy films like this in the years to come.",1336435200,5,1699,4.42443729903537

5014385,5,B006QWC2ZC,"<strong>Absentia</strong> (Mike Flanagan, 2011)

<em>Absentia</em> first hit my radar after the Fantasia Film Festival, held every July in Canada. I saw a number of bloggers give it the Canadian equivalent of a Best in Show award, and determined I'd check it out when it came to DVD. (I knew better than to think it would ever appear on the big screen in Cleveland, though I was intrigued enough to ask if it could be added to the Capitol Theatre's all-night horror-thon in October. Which obvioiusly didn't happen.) That determination was sharpened when the end of the year rolled around...and a lot of those same critics--plus more--started putting <em>Absentia</em> on the tops of their best-of-the-year lists. (In fact, the only movie I saw top more of those was <em>Drive</em>.) By the time I got my hands on a copy thanks to the good folks at Netflix, I had already seen one film that would be in contention for best-of-2011, <em>Bellflower</em>, and <em>Drive</em> was sitting on the mantel waiting for me to get to it.

It no longer matters. <em>Absentia</em> is a movie so good that there are few years in which it <em>wouldn't</em> be the best film of the year. My first impression was that with a clearer head and a few day's distance, I might be able to find some things about the movie that would make me knock it down to four and a half stars; I can't remember the last time I gave out two five-star movie reviews in the space of a month (cf. <em>Jeux Interdits</em> review 13Mar12). [Which is one reason it's great to keep a spreadsheet. The last time it happened was five years ago; <em>Sunset Blvd.</em> got one on 12Apr07 and <em>Ikiru</em> got one on 11May07. For the record, <em>Ikiru</em> would be the last film to which I have a five-star review for two years.] But I've given the movie those few days, I've read other reviews of the film and examined the criticisms, I've examined the things I thought I might eventually become less than thrilled with, and I should mention ""other people's criticisms of the film"" and ""things I thought might have been weak"" are mutually exclusive categories (more on that later), and I realized that it didn't matter how much I was going to pick at this film, it is sheer, unadulterated gold.

Plot: Tricia (<em>Step Up 2: The Streets</em>' Courtney Bell)'s husband Daniel (<em>Nailed</em>'s Morgan Peter Brown) disappeared seven years ago, and she is headed towards filing to have him declared dead in absentia. Her sister Callie (<em>Cut</em>'s Katie Parker), a former narcotics addict now in recovery (and on the religion kick), is in town to offer moral support, and Detective Mallory (<em>Asylum</em>'s Dave Levine), who took over the investigation after the original detective retired, is also hovering close. And here's the first question this film will make you ask: if the husband has been missing for seven years, how is Tricia pregnant? (An answer is suggested. Pay attention. I have seen way too many people ask this question.)

None of which sounds like a horror film. Which is both one of the movie's strongest points and one of the things that has caused such great ire from disappointed people on comment threads at places like IMDB: for most of its length, <em>Absentia</em> is not a horror film at all, especially not in the sense we in the 2010s think of a horror film. To understand where Flanagan is coming from, you have to go back farther than that, to a period where people remembered what horror films are actually for--the examination of feelings of fear and heartbreak that accompany loss. And the first half of this film is absolutely, and completely, about Tricia's feelings towards Daniel's disappearance and her guilt at having him declared dead. It's a drama, not a horror film, and when the supernatural stuff does start appearing (and it does in the second half of the film), it is there mostly to augment the drama rather than provide a horror element. (I feel an urge to compare this to <em>YellowBrickRoad</em> in this regard, though <em>Absentia</em> is a far superior film.)

I've seen two main criticisms of the film that actually hold water (there is a small batch of people who are criticizing the film's near-perfect script, which makes absolutely no sense to me, so I'm not going to even consider that one), though I found neither bothersome at all. The first is that this isn't actually a horror film. I think I've already covered that one, and when it comes right down to it, it's not the movie's fault if it was mismarketed (or if you think it was mismarketed). The second has to do with the movie's soundtrack, and I've seen this criticism from professional critics as well as the hoi polloi posting on the message boards. I did notice some repetition, but really, folks, if you thought that was bad, go watch <em>The Turin Horse</em>, one of the best movies made in 2010 despite having a soundtrack that contains just two pieces (one of which is far more grating than the main theme here could ever dream of being). When I was looking at things I might want to ding the film for, I focused more on the acting, but the more I thought about it, the more I thought Bell and Parker were going for that kind of <em>cinema verit</em> feel a la Cassavettes, and was willing to let it slide. Other than that, there's nothing at all I can fault this movie for. Pitch-perfect pacing, one of the better scripts I've come across in a horror movie in years, very good cinematography, well-drawn characters with realistic emotional reactions... I really have nothing at all bad to say about this movie. But do yourself a favor and go into it with no expectations. This is not a horror film like any that has been released in the past thirty-odd years, and if you're looking for that sort of experience, look elsewhere. For the rest of us, <em>Absentia</em> is one of the best movies of the past decade. *****",1335484800,,5899,4.751219512195122
5014386,1,B006QWC2ZC,"A friend invited me over to watch this and I was expecting quite a lot from this film based on past reviews...

Wow...'awful' doesn't come close to describing it.

- The conclusion to the story was ridiculous (and not in a absurd cool kind of way). So bad in fact that it looks like it was thought up by a five year old suffering from heat stroke. What gets me is that movie studios actually 'ok' the pitch and fork over the cash for it to be made. In the case of this film it would have gone something like this:

"" People go missing, and there's this tunnel, and then there's a bit of an awkward situation when people re-appear (preganacy, whos the dadday? etc) and then we find out that its all due to a big *spoiler* looking thing (which we won't show to save loads of money), like the kind you find in your cupboard if you don't keep the house clean and then the lead actress runs down the tunnel and loses her shoe, then we roll the titles...""

No exaggeration, it was this dumb and when it comes to horror films I can be VERY lenient.

- Call me judgemental but this was SUPER distracting: Almost ALL the lead actors/actresses in this movie were overweight (some even obese!) apart from the husband. I'd omit this from the review but it turns out that 4 out 4 people watching it with me made the exact same remark! It got to the point where you are so distracted by the fact that they try and hide this with super baggy clothing, super baggy tracksuits, surplus military shirts (baggy) etc that its impossible to even try and focus on the story. Watching the lead actress go jogging every morning was painful...for anyone who has ever ran anywhere it looks like she has never tried to jog in her life...wearing 3/4 baggy tracksuits don't help either. The acting was sub-sub par as well...

To cut a long story short:

- Terrible script (and I LOVE horror movies)
- If 6 months from now someone asks me what I remember from this film it would be that it was 'something with a tunnel and loads of fat actors'.

5014387,1,B006QWC2ZC,"Even allowing that they only had $70K to make this film...it sucked.  The following review is to counteract the undeserved positive reviews written by friends, family, and investors of this...film.

Hits every cliche in the book (tough cop with heart of gold, weepy woman missing her lost man, slightly prettier and sassier sister who won't let go of the mystery, spooky shadows, sudden in your face cuts).  The mystery, by the way SPOILER AHEAD is that they built a bridge over some troll caves, and the trolls are apparently members of the cricket family.  We can't say for sure since the filmmakers saved on money by filming mostly in darkness (no one has heard of light bulbs) so we have to content ourselves with cricket sounds and the shocking ending...prettier/sassier sister standing in the tunnel looking at fat cop while a cricket feeler (leg? finger?) strokes her shoulder.  That feeler was the best actor in this film - it emoted while stroking her shoulder.  Prior to that, it was like a third rate film school project that received a poor grade.

One scene, where the sister leaves some food for Doug Jones (how did they make him appear in this for 4 minutes is beyond me), which causes him to leave some buttons on her door step.  What, he left the tunnel, dropped off some buttons, and then went back to the trolls?  Why did the cricket trolls allow him to do that?  Also, did he steal their buttons?  Why buttons?  Why not some goat meat or milk?

If only she had fed it some puppies (seriously)...",1335052800,26,1515,4.629213483146067
5014388,3,B006QWC2ZC,"Spoilers ahead! I liked it for the most part because the premise was original but the pacing of the film held me back from really enjoying it.

Pros

Original plot. It's nice they took something as cliche as the troll under the bridge and turned it into an interesting premise for a movie.

Not a Gore-fest--relies more on plot which too few horror films do today.

Cons

My main criticism is the pacing--the movie was really slow . The first almost 30 minutes of the movie could have been cut down and the last 30-40 minutes should have been expanded. By the time things got going--I almost didn't want to watch anymore. The meat of the film, i.e. the discovery that something malevolent lives under the bridge, the circumstances around daniel's second disappearance, the history of crazy disappearances in the area etc should have been much longer

The script is more character driven than most horror films which makes for a more intelligent movie...but somehow the movie still lacks soul. I didn't really care about the characters as much as you should in a character driven movie.

Not enough scares--when daniel appears to his wife he looks less like a ghost and more like a man in halloween make-up. I understand it's a low budget film and think that overall they did well with that--but it really took away from the scare factor.

The acting seems forced in some places--especially the scenes between the sisters in the beginning. The acting wasn't terrible throughout--there are great scenes and then not so great scenes.

The soundtrack and ""feel"" of this movie was distracting and what I would expect of a more ""artsy"" film like 21 grams, drive, crash, babel, etc. I just didn't think it worked--it felt like the movie needed to make up it's mind--was it a horror film or was it trying to inspire me to feel something profound?

As an aside:
It really makes you think about just how terrible it must feel to have a family member disappear. Watching them put up fresh missing posters broke my heart.",1334793600,6,2009,4.714285714285714
5014389,4,B006QWC2ZC,"A very well crafted and quite an entertaining film with a very limited budget. a pleasant surprise i'd say.
from the start of the film, it was quite evident that it was made with a very low budget, an average type of camera work and not the fanciest of soundtrack music to buy or compose "" yet, the music was creepy, and pretty good "". not to mention, a group of unknown actors.
yet I continued watching, and I found myself getting attached to the characters and getting engaged deeply into the story !
and yes, the special effects and scares were almost average, but the execution was excellent an eliminated the feel and look of a low budget film.

the story involves a woman named Tricia "" Courtney Bell "" whom her husband Daniel has been missing for seven years. Her younger sister Callie "" Katie Parker "" comes to live with her as the pressure mounts to finally declare him 'dead in absentia.' As Tricia finally get over her trauma of losing her husband and tries to move on with her life, Callie finds herself drawn to a dark and creepy tunnel near the house. As she begins to link it to other mysterious disappearances, it becomes clear that Daniel's presumed death might be anything but 'natural.

the plot moves in a steady pace, never dragging. loveable characters, played pretty well with the actors, I especially enjoyed Katie Parker's acting, she had a memorable performance,not to mention a cute face ;)
 and while the acting here was nothing special, it was still believable and definitely above average !
what makes the film so special, is the atmosphere and the script, it was very well written and really lifted the film to above average.

Im such a movie buff, i enjoy and love everything  involving movies. I have a dream of making a film someday, though it has nothing to do with my current career and me not having an enough budget for it, simply, a distant dream, however, seeing such a success in films like Absentia is an inspiration for me to someday be able to fulfill my own dream as well...

Bravo !! i really admire the effort from the guys behind this film, a job well done :)

If you guys enjoyed this, you might also like another low budget Horror film called Evidence, which is yet to be released on Amazon U.S but available at Amazon U.K

5014390,5,B006QWC2ZC,"I'm not going to give any spoilers away here, but I must caution that this film is not your traditional horror movie. There is no gore, very little violence, and no torture or any of that kind of stuff. Instead, this movie is driven by the eerie atomsphere, a chilling mystery, and a revelation at the end that is very unsettling.

This is the type of movie that makes you think a little. It disturbs you, and leaves you wanting more, even though the ending is somewhat conclusive to the film's story. The acting is fine, the pace could be a little faster but the slower pace is essential for creating the atmosphere the film needs to succeed. This film is more for fans of the ""Twilight Zone"" than for fans of the ""Saw"" movies; it is 180 degrees from a torture film.

But after you watch this, and think about it for a while, it is dark and disturbing and it takes you to places that movies rarely attempt to venture. And somehow, without any of the big, robust Hollywood big budget effects, it gets there. Tis film may not be for everyone, but I will say this: it is unlike any movie I have ever seen. 4.5 stars.",1334361600,4,1114,4.3

Second, there aren't many special effects like one would see in Independence Day.

Third, I feel the writing was great because it didn't leave any holes and tied the mystery of where these people disappeared to through clues throughout the movie.

There are many low budget movies that have excellent writing that are being made. I rented another one recently (I forgot the name), which didn't have alot of special effects, but it was great drama.

I would put this under excellent written horror drama, without the special effects. It doesnt have a big budget. So if there are any people proclaiming no one told them, then they didn't read this review.",1334188800,,804,4.640845070422535
5014392,2,B006QWC2ZC,"I like subtlety. So much so that I tend to prefer movies that most of my friends tell me are ""boring"" to them. Films like ""Metropia"" and ""Somewhere"" and ""Far North"" I think are really awesome, so my dislike of this film does not stem from a disinterest in ""subtle"" films.

For some reason, this film has in its cast - three overweight actors as leads. Now if this film needed a chubby cast to fulfill its mission from a narrative standpoint, I'd say ""fine."" However, it was a bit of a turn off for me, visually speaking to see that I'd be following the exploits of a small group of chubby characters throughout the film.

There's a reason the Hollywood film making machine casts good looking, height/weight proportionate people in their movies and I'd caution any independent filmmaker to follow their lead in that regard.

From a story standpoint, I was overwhelmingly of the feeling that this film mined the same story approach as Paranormal Activity. That is to say - the suggestion of something sinister at work without much substance leaves a viewer to fill in the blanks while the cast fumbles around with weak material.

Is it scary? About as scary as Paranormal Activity, yes.

The other aspect of the film that bugged me was the lack of connection between the visions our chubby heroine had and the return of her long lost husband. We get to see a character who's been missing for 7 years over and over and over again, and then, he returns in the flesh. Was she imagining things, or what? It's just never explained.

As for the technical aspects of the film, its all adequately handled, but it's hard to not be distracted by certain other questionable directorial decisions that stick out like a sore thumb.",1334102400,4,1716,4.628289473684211

5014394,5,B006QWC2ZC,"Absentia could have been one of those films you see once and forget. It was made on little money, and a great Kickstarter campaign. It is mostly a box film with the house being the main set. It has a small cast and the suggestion of special effects. What it has in surplus is a great story and amazing characters.
  Mike Flanagan has a wonderful cast. From the first scene you get pure sympathetic performances from Courtney Bell & Katie Parker. As the cast expands you get Dave Levine's great cop only matched by Justin Gordon. At no point was I not believing a character.
  One beautiful element to this script is the dialogue. It is true. It is quick and isn't bogged down by long orations. It is people speaking as people speak. That is a rare gift for any screenwriter.
  Next this film is scary. The first act alone had me jumping at more points than I'd like to admit. At the third act I knew what was coming and still jumped.
  Flanagan needs to do more films now. Absentia the disc is filled with great extras. The retrospective is insightful to the entire film.
  I'm a huge fan of ELB (Extremely Low Budget) films. They force the cast & crew to work at a level bigger budgets can cast aside. Absentia will stay with me for days. It has found that small dark corner of the mind and won't come out.",1333584000,3,1307,4.319672131147541

This one is different.

It slowly builds up to a great ending. If you're more into blood & gore & don't care about a strong story, you will most likely get bored with this.

What we have is a human interest story  with thriller elements that may be a horror film deep within the screenplay's core.  If you are the type of individual that likes strong character development and mysteries that slowly fill in pieces of the plot you'll enjoy this movie tremendously.  As I was watching it the story went in various directions that made you wonder if the plot was simply focusing on a missing person and two women trying to come to grips within a place and time in their lives.  But more adequately, the movie begins to fill in with details that may be a greater mystery relating to lost folks grounded in plot devices right out of an Arthur Machen story.  With our two lead protagonists appearing to be unreliable narrators, the film slips into the unknown even more so.  I'm trying to be as vague as possible since everyone should go in knowing nothing about this film.  If you are looking to introduce someone to horror films, this is a good place to start since the thriller and mystery aspect of the plot give it a great cross over appeal (unlike what the box cover may present, ha ha).

A monster you never really see, a story that's never really explained and the spots in between filled with girl drama.

5014411,4,B006QWC2ZC,"I had never heard of the film, ABSENTIA, before it arrived in my mailbox for review on my website, so to be honest, I wasn't super excited or motivated to watch it.  There are so many horror films that come and go without much notice, and usually it is for a good reason.  You have to weed through a lot of bad films to find a good one, and I am happy to say this film is a ""needle in the haystack"" of horror films.  Everyone should know about this film and it is a shame that it hasn't received more fanfare.

 I loved everything about this film.  I would be lying if I said I understood it completely, but that is part of what makes me like it so much.  It is not a simple ""I-saw-that-coming"" type of horror film.  This is a smart horror film with a great story with many different levels.  What you think is basic supernatural type of film turns into almost a creature feature towards the end.  I won't say much more about that in fear of spoiling anything for you.

 On paper, I really shouldn't have liked this film so much.  There is no blood or gore to speak of (although there is a messed up looking body at one point), no special effects for the most part, and not  any slasher like killing.  Heck, there is not even the typical horror movie nudity thrown in to this film.  ABSENTIA is too smart for that and is above that.  What you do get is brilliant acting by everyone involved  (especially by the two female leads, played by Katie Parker and Courtney Bell).

 The film is very suspenseful and really plays to the dark and dreadful emotions of loosing a loved one.  Not just loosing a loved one, but the fear of a loved one going missing and having to declare them ""dead in absentia"" even though the slight chance is out there that he or she may still be alive.  That lack of closure would be a horrible feeling and Bell emotes this feeling with perfection in her portrayal of Tricia, who's husband went missing 7 years ago.

 Please do yourself a favor and check out ABSENTIA as soon as you can.  You will not be disappointed.",1332288000,3,2040,4.25
5014412,4,B006QWC2ZC,"Wow. What can I say that hasn't already been said by everyone? ""Absentia"" is wonderful. Sure, it has its flaws (like any small-budget independent film, and even many big-budget Hollywood films), but unlike those films, it's absolutely original and unique, and I have to be honest here --- I am a horror writer and a huge horror junkie, but I have never seen a film quite like ""Absentia."" The DVD cover art is misleading. Yes, there's a monster in it, but the story's main focus is driven by a psychological character study. The monster plot is reserved for the background. The core theme of the film is the emotional trauma between the two main characters. They go through so much in the film's short run time, and their performances are so natural and convincing, that I couldn't help but feel sorry for them more and more as the film progressed. This is one of the few horror films I have ever seen in which I felt so much sympathy for the characters. It's a perfect balance of character-driven drama and creepiness, and the film did an amazing job of evoking that horrible feeling of ""What's in the dark?"" and ""What was that noise?"". Also, the musical score was perfect in combining both heartfelt emotion and a sense of deep dread. It felt like a really well-written book being played out on screen. Watching the special features was extremely interesting, as well, learning that the cast and crew was so small, that it was filmed in the director's real apartment, that the main actress really was pregnant, that the actor playing the detective is really a waiter at a restaurant, etc. As a writer, knowing that these people pulled off something so effective in such a short time with hardly any money at all is so inspiring to me.

After her husband has been missing for 7 years, Tricia (Courtney Bell) is set to have him declared dead and then try to move on. Joined by her troubled sister Callie (Katie Parker), Tricia is reluctantly ready to start a new life when she suddenly starts having hallucinations of her husband who seems to be quite angry about being declared dead and that his wife is now pregnant from her new cop boyfriend (Dave Levine). But, those hallucinations are only the beginning of what seems to a surreal nightmare. Absentia is a very effective low budget chiller from writer/director Mike Flanagan who not only crafts an interesting tale of missing people and what might happen to them but, also touches on the emotional struggle of those left behind. Flanangan maintains an atmosphere of dread and even cleverly leaves enough doubt in our minds that keeps us on edge as to whether this is a product of denial and emotional distress, or, is it really the work of something else. To say anymore would ruin a really enjoyable and spooky low budget horror that is refreshingly back to basics and knows that sometimes less is more.

That being said, I'm an independent filmmaker myself and I must say, to get a movie on here and have people actually see it and have it announced over on <...> is a major accomplishment.

I applaud the filmmakers for making it that far and dang, I hope you got a sweet distro deal.

REVIEW: Finally, I must say I wasn't a fan of this movie, simply because I thought the acting was weak and the pacing was a little slow. It's definitely a great option if you like slow mystery and is damn impressive for low budget (thought I don't really know what the budget was.

I was really pissed because the girl who's on the cover is not the lead girl in the film, and it is definitely not as intense as the cover makes it seem, and to perfectly frank, she's definitely not as hot, though she has a nice face. But, again, I'm talking of the secondary lead because the main lead is pregnant, so I have no judgment on her looks.

Also, they really should have come up with more than one line of music for the score, shame on you.

No blond hair bimbos or six-pack abbed studs here,  The cast is refreshingly normal looking and amazingly believable,.  It's the strength of these characters that drive this low-budget indie.  We can believe Callie and Trisha are sisters, flesh and blood with faults and virtues and as the film slowly moves to its tragic finale, we come to like and empathize with them.  Mallory, the detective, also eschews the stereotypical cop, an average looking guy with strong sensitivity.
ABSENTIA offers a creepy, compelling premise, adopting a Hitchcockian approach where less is more.  The tension is more palpable in just imagining what's hauling off its victims than actually seeing them.
Katie Parker and Courtney Bell are stunning as the sisters and Dave Levine is great as Mallory.  The actor playing Daniel, the missing husband, is also quite good.

I need not have worried. It is easily the best, and more importantly, smartest horror movie of 2011.

The most powerful horror films for me have always been those that exercise restraint, that put emphasis on character and mood, and  give the viewer just enough to let their imaginations fill in the blanks. ABSENTIA is nothing less than a masterpiece of ""quiet"" horror, and unlike most movies in this genre in the current climate, every aspect of it worked for me. The limitations of the budget, rather than being evident in the final film, only enhance the piece. This is what makes great horror, and quite honestly, I haven't been this impressed since THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. Less is only more when the talent is there to capitalize on it, and in the case of ABSENTIA, director Flanagan and his crew have nailed it.

5014423,2,B006QWC2ZC,"So, in seeing other reviews on this, I was actually excited to take a peek at this movie. I definitely appreciate the more mental and minimalist side of the horror genre (I hate Hollywood's current fascination with torture porn...Saw sequels, I'm looking at you). However, this film definitely does not fit the bill.

Many people have stated that this is a slow-burn movie. This is completely untrue. In a good slow-burning horror film, angst/dread/discomfort are present throughout all scenes, even ones where there is no obvious threat. In this film, the ""down"" scenes may just as well have been pulled out of a Lifetime drama about families coping with infidelity and/or drug use. There's no pervasive sense of threat or dread. The film's few horror aspects suffer because of this.

The film attempts to indicate rather than show, particularly with the primary evil antagonist never actually getting a full reveal. This works for other horror films because the viewer is in a mindset of dread throughout, prepping them to fill in the blanks with the most horrifying thing imaginable, even if it's not shown on camera. Without the pervasive sense of discomfort, my psyche remained unrattled. Also, although they don't show the creature, they give it a fairly definite description, further marring any chance that the audience will imagine something truly horrifying as a matter of their own machinations.

On the plus side, the premise is interesting enough and the cast does a fairly good job at their roles. Some dialog options and acting choices are recognizably ""indy"", but the film doesn't suffer for it. Also, the last scene was a good little piece of writing (tiny spoiler), bringing back the idea of justifications used when people go missing addressed earlier in the film.

Overall, this was a lack-luster movie and really not a good example of an independent horror flick. It wasn't a bad attempt, just lacked the atmosphere to deliver any real chills.",1330819200,8,1964,5.033846153846154

5014427,5,B006QWC2ZC,"ABSENTIA isn't your typical contemporary horror film. No slashers or zombies or romantic vampires or Japanese crawling ghosts. Instead, ABSENTIA is a creepy and intelligent supernatural/Locecraftian thriller, with strong dramatic/human subtext and religious/spiritual themes.

Tricia's husband, Daniel, disappeared seven years ago. She's still posting ""Has anybody seen this man?"" flyers on trees, but she's about ready to move on. She's pregnant with another man's child. She's also kinda, sorta seeing this detective. (The film intimates the unborn child is his, though that's never made clear.)

Since it's been seven years, the County of Los Angeles will soon declare Daniel officially dead, and Tricia can begin dating detective Mallory -- openly rather than sorta, kinda.

Then Callie, Tricia's prodigal sister, returns home. Tricia and Daniel had raised the troubled Callie, a runaway druggie who left to backpack across the U.S. But Callie has cleaned up her act. She's a Christian now, in contrast to Tricia's Buddhism.

It's okay. The two sisters love and respect each other.

Then Callie notices something ominous about that creepy, dark tunnel near Tricia's home. Callie can't say for sure why it feels wrong. A homeless man babbles nonsense in the tunnel. (Is he just another homeless crazy?) A teenager leaves a plastic bag by the entrance. (What's inside -- and who is the intended recipient?)

You won't see much of That Which Lurks In The Tunnel. ABESNTIA is minimalist horror. Its monster is intimated rather than seen in long, lingering shots. This may disappoint some gorehounds, but I found ABSENTIA's brief, murky shots to be just right. Perfect, even.

We see shadows. Brief shots of tentacles and feelers -- a bit reptilian, a bit insectisoid. It's all very Lovecraftian. ABSENIA is not specifically based on a Lovecraft story, yet H.P. is clearly one of the film's inspirations.

A strong spirituality also informs ABSENTIA. Callie lives her Christianity. She makes the mistake of reaching out to the homeless man in the tunnel, bringing him food. This lures the monster back to Tricia's home.

It seems these creatures have been abducting people for centuries, dragging them into their lair, which is both beneath the city and in another dimension of space/time.

Although spiritual, ANSENTIA is never preachy. All of its characters are flawed, yet all of them -- Tricia, Callie, detective Mallory, and the deranged Daniel -- try to do the right thing. But these Cthulhuian creatures -- who move through the walls of houses unlucky enough to overlap their dimensions -- are more than most, even good-hearted, mortals can handle.

ABSENTIA's dramatic minimalism is supported by its soundtrack. We hear sound effects that may or may not be monsters -- discreet, difficult-to-identify noises. It sorta sounds like an insect? The music consists of simple, moody melodies that simultaneously support the film's domestic strife and enhance the creepy atmosphere.

Part of ABSENTIA's strength is that its domestic story (of sisters and lovers and estranged spouses -- and their emotional conflicts) is well interwoven with its tale of Lovecraftian creatures. The fear and anger engendered on those two dramatic levels support, and play off of, each other. When Callie reports seeing a giant insect, Tricia blows up at Callie, suspecting her of regressing to her drug habits. ""The last time you saw insects, they were crawling under your arm!""

Director/writers Mike Flanagan is a master of minimalist horror. His short film, OCULUS, was set in one brightly lit room, most of the ""action"" occurring between a man and a mirror. (Both that mirror, and the star of OCULUS -- Scott Graham -- make cameo appearances in ABSENTIA.)

OCULUS drew much of its tension from its script and acting, and ABSENTIA likewise excels in those areas. The film's entire cast is well above average.

ABSENTIA swept many horror film festivals in 2011, including five Tabloid Witch Awards (Best Horror Feature Film, Best Actress, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, Best Sound).",1330128000,,4071,5.241538461538462
5014428,4,B006QWC2ZC,"I've seen a lot of horror movies (pretty much every one offered on Amazon, campy 80's horror movies excluded) and was in the mood for something genuinely creepy and scary to watch this morning. Not an easy task for someone that's seen it all. After watching the trailer for this movie on Youtube it definitely seemed worth a shot. And I was really pleasantly surprised. I have only ever written one other review but I felt like this one was worth the time. Although somewhat low-budget in production value, the quality was still perfectly good enough (no sound, lighting issues etc.) And even though few movies have succeeded in truly creeping me out, this one certainly did. The haunting and graphic images were at time really horrifying and even though they built the tension to the ""big scares"", thus giving away what was about to happen, I still found myself jumping in my seat. And they also snuck in a few totally-out-of-nowhere scares that I don't think anyone could have seen coming. If you're a fan of gore, then you will be disappointed in this movie. But if you want a movie with scares so chilling they won't leave your mind for quite some time, a movie that masterfully builds suspense to the point of breaking every last nerve of the viewer and a story that I have yet to see in any other movie... then spend the $4 and have good time.",1330128000,3,1349,4.555555555555555

5014430,5,B006QWC2ZC,"I watched 20 seconds of the trailer then stopped... because that's all it took for me to decide to buy and watch this fantastic movie! It's incredibly unique and special. Sometimes when I watch a movie I get caught up in things like, ""What were the writers thinking, Jeez..."" or, ""Why did the Director do that?"" NOT with this movie! You're swept up immediately in the story and it's a fun ride ALL the way through! No kidding. I think the best way to describe it is the word ""realistic."" I wish I had a better way to describe it. I believed every moment. I even wanted to get on wikipedia and see if the background story was true! LOL!

I really have to say, as a true fan of the horror genre, this was SUCH a unique and different film that was unbelievably captivating and comprehensive. There's sibling-rivalry emotion anyone with a sister can relate to, poignant love-interest confusion most people can relate to, and just the day-to-day ""WTF is going on?"" angst EVERYONE can relate to. I honestly believed from the moment the two lead actresses met that they were sisters. I even thought, ""Oh... they must be truly related... this is an indie film after all..."" I honestly believed the love interest between the cop and Tricia. They're people we all know. The film exudes honesty and reality. Great job and kudos to the cast. You guys did a fantastic job!

Anyway, buy the movie. You won't regret it. You'll do like I did and email the producers and BEG them for a sequel. LOL! Who doesn't want to know what happens to them?!

5014431,5,B006QWC2ZC,"This is great, quiet, character-driven horror if you dig movies like ""Session 9,"" ""The Eclipse"" or the work of directors like Kiyoshi Kurosawa. It is low budget, psychological rather than explicit, and a slow burn.

If you like movies with graphic gore, T&A, movies like ""Saw"" or ""Hostel,"" or anything by Rob Zombie, you will almost certainly hate this movie. It requires an adult's attention span and an appreciation for character and subtlety. Highly recommended for discerning elevated-genre fans.",1329091200,45,500,5.329113924050633

I don't mind low budget films as long as the acting is good and the story is solid.  I was not disappointed in the least with this one.

That said, this movie will be much better to you going in knowing that fact.

It is a treatise on loss and grief. Very well done. Very creative. It's certainly one you have to invest in for the long haul to get anything out of it, but the acting and writing suck you into a world that is very believable, and one where you want to know about these characters. The story is a good one, not great, but good, using elements of ""Urban Mythos"" horror to underscore the loss theme.

Nice one for a couple thoughtful hours.",1526947200,,550,4.219047619047619
