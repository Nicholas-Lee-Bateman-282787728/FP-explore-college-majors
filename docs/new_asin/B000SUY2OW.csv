2890870,5,B000SUY2OW,IT is scarey and fun to watch. I love it wish they make another part to the movie. I think it is the best horror movie i ever watched.,1386374400,,134,3.6551724137931036
2890871,5,B000SUY2OW,I ordered this double movie set for my neighbors who are cautous about ordering on line. We have told them there is little to woory about on Amazon. The movies arrived when they were supposed to & in great condition. I asked if the movies were alright & they said they watched both of them the the night before & played great.,1352851200,,326,4.274193548387097
2890872,5,B000SUY2OW,"IN MY OPION THIS MOVIE IS OK. THE CAST DID A GREAT JOB, BUT THE ACTOR PLAYING THE CREATURE IS OUTSTANDING. HE MADE ME THINK THAT THIS CREATURE IS REAL.HOLLYWOOD HAS BEN KNOWN TO MAKE HORROR FILMS LOOK REAL HORRIBLE, NOT THIS ONE. THE ONE THING THAT DID IMPRESS ME WAS, THIS WAS A CREATURE FOR EVERY 23 YEARS FOR 21 DAYS CAN EAT ALL HE WANTS.YOU SLEEP FOR 23 YEARS & EAT FOR 21 DAYS. I CAN SAY THAT THIS MOVIE SHOULD BE IN YOUR COLLECTION.",1313193600,,438,4.045977011494253
2890873,2,B000SUY2OW,The outer cover had some inprints of being shanked with a some kind of sharp needle instrument and the first disc had a scratch. I could have bought it at Wally World for $16.00.,1309046400,3,178,4.264705882352941
2890874,4,B000SUY2OW,"The premise for ""Jeepers Creepers"" is simple -- two kids, a brother and sister on break from college are crossing the country when they see what apepars to be a man dumping a human body down a well. They investigate -- and a nightmare explodes around them! Before long they are being pursued by an otherworldly creature that kills promiscuously. Great fun and good scares. Genuine horror without too much gore. In ""Jeepers Creepers 2"" (He's ba-a-a-ack!) the monster attacks an entire bus of high schoolers. Lots of thrills and chills but not as in-depth as the first one. Both are worth watching, though. Genuinely unnerving moments in both. A roller-coaster ride of horror!",1192406400,8,674,4.921052631578948
2890875,5,B000SUY2OW,Ads so many extras in commentary.,1516579200,,33,4.666666666666667
2890876,5,B000SUY2OW,Just as good as the first movie. Well worth watching.,1516320000,,53,4.4
2890877,5,B000SUY2OW,"The first one was so creepy bc of the suspense. This one, the monster is everywhere and good fun to see what they do to elude capture.  I really don't like buses. This flick reinforces that quirky shiver I get from the bus.",1515456000,,223,4.186046511627907
2890878,5,B000SUY2OW,"Here to discuss the art, not Victor Salva the monster. This is an entertaining film, and the blu-ray transfer is very high quality. As a sequel it doesnt hold up as well against its predecessor but it delivers a lot of action and thrills. This product came in perfect condition. Didnt have a slip cover but its still in brand new condition. Tons of special features make this and the first collectors edition very worth the purchase. If you're a fan of this sequel then this is the ultimate edition for your collection.",1514505600,,519,4.591397849462366
2890879,2,B000SUY2OW,"This doesn't have the same feeling as the first movie. The first movie was scary and creepy and suspenseful. I don't get these feelings at all while watching this sequel. My attention was fading and I looked at the screen at one point and thought, hm, who is the character running through the field? Oh....that is supposed to be the creature. Very anti-climatic. Lacks any ominous feeling.",1513382400,,389,4.82089552238806

2890884,4,B000SUY2OW,One of the better modern horror movies.,1510790400,,39,4.714285714285714
2890891,5,B000SUY2OW,"I've seen this several times in the past, and was glad to see it here on Amazon Prime, so that I can see it some more. I totally agree with most of the other reviewers,  this one tops the first movie, by far. JC2 gives me the creeps, and everytime they show the Creeper's face, boy does he scare me even more! He has got to be one among the top scariest faces ever seen in movies, what a triumph in horror movies this is because of it. It has it moments of comedy, or actually dark humor, no pun intended, but the movie is suspenseful, dramatic, and really frightening, a truly enjoyable movie to watch",1509408000,,602,4.189655172413793
2890892,5,B000SUY2OW,"In the multi-genred  world of B movies, the sequel sub-genre traditionally gets mostly laughs and its unheard of for a sequel to be BETTER than the original. I'm happy to report that JC 2 is, in my opinion, better than the original.",1509408000,2,232,4.523809523809524

2890897,1,B000SUY2OW,"Honestly, I'm not normally a horror movie fan, but Jeepers Creepers was an exception.  I truly enjoyed it.  It had some suspense, a good story, and it wasn't to campy.  It built tension throughout the whole movie. Because of that, I was really excited to see the sequel.

And then I watched it.

Not sure what happened to the director between the movies.  Some personal tragedy?  A new drug habit?  A fat check to make an unplanned sequel cleared the bank?  I don't know and it's all supposition on my part but it's pretty clear he was giving zero s**ts while making this one.  The only common feature between the two movies is that both feature a monster called the same thing.  There is zero continuity between the two movies and the atmosphere is completely different, despite being set only a few days apart.",1508284800,2,812,4.569444444444445

2890912,3,B000SUY2OW,I am a sucker for Scream Factory Collector's Edition Blu-Rays so when I saw that they were releasing the original Jeepers Creepers and it's sequel I knew I had to pick them up. I think the first Jeepers Creepers is by the far the superior film but the 2nd is still fun. The new extras are a nice edition and you get some good interviews with star Ray Wise and writer/director Victor Salva who also does an audio commentary with the cast. For fans of horror or the franchise this is must-by but sadly is not as good as the blu-ray release of the original.,1470528000,,554,4.285714285714286
2890913,3,B000SUY2OW,"The movie itself is not very good, but the supplemental package is worth every penny.",1470182400,,85,4.733333333333333
