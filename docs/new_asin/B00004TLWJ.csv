7922986,3,B00004TLWJ,"Maybe it's good for those first few weeks postpartum, mostly stretching and some abdominal exercises, but not much of a challenge.
After doing prenatal yoga during my entire pregnancy (that included squats and lots of standing poses), this seems kind of wimpy.",1062547200,,260,5.214285714285714
7922987,2,B00004TLWJ,"I found this video to be too long without much payback in terms of relaxation.  I also thought that some of the exercises were inappropriate for the early postnatal period but that Colette neglected to point all of them out.  Some are noted, but occasionally not until after the pose is shown, so some people might be tempted to do too much too soon.  I also didn't care much for the production quality.  I guess I'm just used to the Living Arts videos.  I would also have preferred to see more babies in the video, as one of the reasons I bought it was to find a way to exercise while my son was awake.  Since he never napped for more than 10 minutes at a time and needed constant holding, I was disappointed to find no poses modified so that you could use your infant as part of the pose.
Prenatally I did the Yoga Mama video and Shiva Rea's video, both of which I truly enjoyed.  They are both very different from this video, which may be one of the reasons I don't like it that much.",1049587200,2,987,4.190476190476191
7922988,5,B00004TLWJ,"This tape is a treat! I never thought I'd be excercising to a video at home, but with a(nother) new baby at home, I can't always get out when I want. The music is soothing, and Collette's voice and the poses call to me from the other side of calm during my hectic day. I like how I can play it in short intervals (because I rarely have a long one) and get that nursing tweek out of my neck or stretch out my back.  I even feel like my belly is decreasing!",982800000,10,455,3.89247311827957
7922989,5,B00004TLWJ,"This video is wonderfully designed for busy mothers - if you can find time to do a 25 minute series of excersizes, breathing and stretching the first part of the tape walks you through.  If, however, you just have 15 minutes between baby nap time and doing laundry the final part of the tape shows you through some basic stretches and relaxation poses.  (There are also some excellent basic tips for lifting and holding your baby.)
The video never assumes you know the poses, it clearly takes you through each excersize and Collette's soothing voice calmly reminds you to keep breathing and cautions when poses may prove too challenging for women who have had c-sections or are early post-partum.
This has been my treat during the day - I use it whenever I get a chance and it both relaxes me and makes me feel like I'm doing something to get my body back in shape.  Wonderful music, lighting and examples of mothers working with their babies!",979171200,21,943,4.634730538922156
