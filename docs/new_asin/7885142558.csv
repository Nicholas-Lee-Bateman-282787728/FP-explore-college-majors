7900169,5,7885142558,"This is by far one of the best films I have ever seen. It had plenty of action and drama without being gory and overwhelming. I was moved to tears by one scene in particular, and I'm not usually one to cry much watching movies. I also liked that the story didn't exactly go as you might expect. The costumes are also really fantastic.",1379289600,,334,4.234375
7900170,4,7885142558,"Good entertainment . If one enjoys Chinese cinema , as I do , then one will easily like this one . It is not epic scale like Red Cliff or some other offerings . It has love , heroism , sacrifice , betrayal , loss and triumph woven nicely into a good heroic , Chinese patriotic story , with a feminist twist into the mix . The film is neither fast and tense nor slow pace and sloppy and does not bore . It could have been expanded  but almost two hours it does a good job of telling the story .",1320883200,,493,3.8333333333333335

7900172,5,7885142558,This movie is epic. Forget that Disney crap (which is also kinda awesome in its own way) and watch a real movie!,1316908800,,112,4.136363636363637
7900173,5,7885142558,"I previously purchased a cheap bootleg of this movie by accident, so I took a chance on this. I wasn't expecting much given the price. The DVD, however is excellent, and this appears to be an officially licensed DVD. Picture quality and sound was excellent, something lacking in the other DVD I purchased. Highly recommended. The movie is great also. Unlike the Disney animated feature this one is probably appropriate only for those 13+",1296691200,3,437,4.918918918918919
7900174,5,7885142558,"The epic story of the Chinese girl-warrior, Mulan, who fights to defend her father. This film is great, and similar in genre to HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS, CROUCHING TIGER, and possibly RED CLIFF. If you liked those films, you will like this one. The battle scenes aren't as epic as RED CLIFF, and they aren't supposed to be. This movie is more about relationships than any of these other films, and that is where the differences lie. It is a very touching film

The packaging of this DVD is MINIMAL. It comes in just a glossy cardboard slipcase, that is shrinkwrapped. The DVD is in its own plastic envelope for protection. If you're still collecting and displaying your DVD collection, you won't want this DVD. If you just want to see the movie, this is for you. Personally, DVDs just get in the way, and I put them in case logic binders anyway, so this is perfect for me.",1296691200,3,871,4.477987421383648
