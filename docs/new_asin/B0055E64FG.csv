4573979,5,B0055E64FG,"Having written a review of ""Rider on the Rain"" in another DVD edition, and having bought the film three other times besides a copy taped from cable, it was never satisfyingly enough captured until this edition with the plus of ""Farewell Friend"" also.  Here is presented a widescreen anamorphic presentation of both films starring Charles Bronson and ""Rider"" has not looked so good since I had seen it in the theater in 1970.  ""Farewell Friend"" (AKA: ""Honor Among Thieves"") dated to 1968 and teams Bronson with Alain Delon (who re-teamed in the hit ""Red Sun"" in 1971) and also is written by one of my favorite authors, Sebastien Japrisot which I did not know until this DVD arrived.  I do not think Bronson's comeback did not reach the States until ""Rider on the Rain,"" but ""Farewell Friend"" claims to have been his breakthrough role.  ""Rider on the Rain"" also stars Marlene Jobert who I wish had done more as I find her role of ""Melancoly"" in this to be one of the most engaging screen characters I've come across and she plays it exquisitely.  She started her career in Jean Luc Godard's ""Masculine Feminine"" in 1966 and after ""Rider on the Rain"" she was not in anything recognizable.  A pity.  Sebastien Japrisot wrote ""Rider"" as well and he had another success of many recently with his novel, ""A Very Long Engagement.""  Joseph E. Levine was responsible for bringing ""Rider on the Rain"" to us and he was responsible for bringing cheap European spectacles to us like the ""Hercules"" films and used the money to finance films like ""8-1/2"" and ""Divorce, Italian Style"" and with his own company, Embassy Films, he produced for Paramount such films as ""The Carpetbaggers"" and ""Where Love Has Gone.""  ""Rider on the Rain"" was not a cheap spectacle as directed by Rene Clement, but a high quality piece of art, but has been sold to many outlets for distribution, and as I've testified previously, the last one I bought on DVD sounded like it was recorded underwater.  Rene Clement has never been as good with this film.  He is a director that film buffs should get to know as he consistently delivers.  His last film was the misunderstood, ""Wanted: Babysitter"" in 1975 recently released on DVD.  He died in 1996.  ""Rider"" is one of his masterpieces.  ""Farewell Friend"" was directed by Jean Herman.  It is truly a pleasant surprise to get these two films together with such a quality presentation by Wild East Productions.  This is Vol. 4 of their EuroCrime Collection and quite a stunner.  Thank you.",1319414400,27,2494,4.733796296296297
4573980,5,B0055E64FG,"Charles Bronson was a big star in Europe before he broke in the U.S. with these two films, the east meets west western Red Sun and  Sergio Leone's classic Once Upon A Time in the West. I've read somewhere that Mr. Bronson did not like to watch his own movies but he did admit to being partial to the aforementioned Red Sun and the little seen French New Wave-ish-Noir-mystery-thriller Rider on the Rain. It really is a one of a kind picture: Moody, atmospheric, odd, unsettling at times but strangely compelling and ultimately satisfying. Not much real action per se but a very 1960's feeling Hitchcock like imitation with its own kooky rhythms and style. His performance in this and in the companion picture on this dvd, Farewell Friend feature a decidedly less typical Bronson: Looser, cooler, casual, unaffected  and kind of well...hip for a guy his age in the 1960's anyway. Farewell Friend is maybe a little too pretentious for my taste but it has its' moments. It's well shot with lots of swinging looking 60's chicks in that Austin Powers like gear and Bronson's pretty good humored in it. I for one am glad to own a copy of Rider on the Rain finally in any form and this appears to be a good enough treatment. Not much in the extra department aside from some trailers but again I'm just glad the movie's are available in a decent format.",1311033600,25,1345,4.576763485477178
4573981,4,B0055E64FG,"These are reviews of the movies themselves, not any type of transfer, be it DVD, Blue Ray etc..

""Farewell Friend"" aka ""Honor Among Thieves"" is a stylish but very adult action drama that features stars Alain Delon and Charles Bronson at the top of their form.  If you know and appreciate Italian thrillers, you will enjoy this, but merely be fore-warned.  Not a good film as an introduction to the genre.

""Rider on the Rain"" has a handsome reputation, but one that I do not think it particularly deserves. Overlong and uninteresting.  However, one can decide for himself.  I rather recommend Bronson's ""Someone Behind the Door"": and this being a film that can serve as an introduction to the genre.",1440028800,,699,4.783333333333333

4573985,4,B0055E64FG,"I once read that Rider on the Rain is the best Charles Bronson movie that not many people in the US have seen. While I don't know how many have seen it, it is, in my opinion, one of Bronson's best acting jobs and and maybe the best movie that he made. He's also surrounded by an excellent supporting cast, particularly Marlene Jobert (who had the leading female role). It's a very good suspense movie, and I'm very glad I found it on DVD.",1405987200,3,438,4.226190476190476

4573987,5,B0055E64FG,I was so glad to see this movie in widescreen and good sound. I have copies of it that sound like they were transferred on an old VHS in the YMCA. This is a treasure. Thanks to the people who did such a nice transfer.,1376352000,,217,3.8444444444444446
4573988,4,B0055E64FG,"I just became aware of this double-feature DVD from an outfit called The Wild East, and I had to order it immediately. Not for Charles Bronson, although he is very good in both of these French films. The reason I had to have it was my favorite French mystery writer, Sebastien Japrisot (1931-2003). Early in his career, the late novelist (TRAP FOR CINDERELLA, A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT, THE LADY IN THE CAR WITH GLASSES AND A GUN) wrote 2 original screenplays, and both films starred Bronson. Now, at last, both films are available here in decent widescreen prints, for a decent price. (Beware of online offers for really bad pirated versions of both titles.) And they're both in English--another plus. No subtitles!

FAREWELL, FRIEND (Jean Herman,1968): Bronson stars with Alain Delon in this odd ""buddy movie"" about two former mercenaries who team up to help a shady lady (Olga Georges-Picot) break into her company's vault. But she says she doesn't want to rob it--she wants to put something back (???). Hmmm. Any sane person would smell a set-up, but these guys are blinded by her beauty, and one of them has a guilty secret that makes him feel he owes her the favor. When the two men get trapped in the vault over a long holiday weekend, the fun (and the danger) really begins. Japrisot's screenplay and the terrific byplay between the two stars are the highlights of this otherwise routine ""caper"" film.

RIDER ON THE RAIN (Rene Clement, 1970): This is the real reason to get this DVD. The great French director, Rene Clement, teamed with Japrisot for this exciting, elegant, Hitchcockian thriller set in a small seaside village near Marseilles. A young wife (lovely French star Marlene Jobert), whose airline navigator husband is away, is sexually assaulted in her isolated home by a creepy man who rode in on the bus that afternoon. She manages to get to her husband's shotgun and kill the intruder. In a panic, she doesn't call the police, choosing instead to drive the body to the nearest cliff and dump it in the sea. She nearly gets away with it, too--until a mysterious American man (Bronson) arrives in the village. He seems to know all about everything that's happened, and he begins to follow and torment the woman. It seems the dead man was an escaped criminal with a big stash of stolen money in an airline bag, and now she has that bag. The psychological cat-and-mouse game between Bronson and Ms. Jobert intensifies, creating nearly 2 hours of suspense with several big surprises along the way. Clement's usual fine direction, the rain-drenched coastal setting, and the performances of the two stars are all very good reasons to see this, but the real star is Sebastien Japrisot. He was one of our finest mystery writers, and this is an excellent example of his brilliant, devious mind at work. RIDER ON THE RAIN is a must-see film for anyone who loves the best in suspense.

Warning: I had some trouble with the main menu on this DVD--it doesn't seem to work properly. But a bit of fiddling with the controls on my remote finally got the corect movie going. You might have the same problem, but try hitting ""Enter"" once (for RIDER ON THE RAIN) or twice (for FAREWELL, FRIEND). It should work, eventually. Enjoy!",1376265600,4,3229,4.75222816399287
4573989,3,B0055E64FG,I enjoyed this dvd with the two movies.  Charles Bronson is one of my favorite actors.  Always gives a good performance.,1357862400,,120,4.666666666666667
4573990,5,B0055E64FG,"These two extremely fine, well-crafted films really gave Charles Bronson an opportunity to demonstrate what a talented, charismatic actor he was. I found these films to be intelligently written and demanding of a certain level of concentration (and intelligence) in order to keep up with their story lines. They will have you guessing to the end. Unlike modern Hollywood productions, they are not dumbed-down to the presumed level of their audience.

  Bronson's truly effective on-screen relationships with Alain Delon in ""Farewell Friend"", and Marlene Jobert in ""Rider On The Rain"", are due not only to the quality of the scripts, but also to the superior acting ability of all concerned (Jobert is a standout), and that indefinable something which relatively few actors possess to any great extent.

  I do not intend to discuss the content of the films themselves since that information can easily be found elsewhere on the internet. Instead, let me (briefly) review the DVD itself.

  I think I can honestly state that you will never find a better edition of these films than this one, released by Wild East. The picture and sound quality are truly excellent. Both films are anamorphic widescreen and enhanced for 16/9 televisions. Both are accompanied by trailers and interesting photo galleries (posters, stills, lobby-cards).

  All-in-all, highly recommended if, like me, you have a taste for these kind of films which, for better or worse, seem to belong to yesterday, not to mention the wonderful performers who starred in them.

  P.S. Can anyone tell me if it's just my imagination or does the actress who dubs Marlene Jobert sound somewhat like Ursula Andress?",1335744000,14,1674,5.148148148148148

8458131,5,B0055E64FG,"The first half hour of Rider on the Rain is especially mysterious and hypnotic.  The moody musical score adds to the overall effect.  The scriptwriter is Sebastien Japrisot who also wrote The Sleeping Car Murders, The Lady in a Car with Glasses and a Gun, and A Very Long Engagement.  This movie is definitely redolent of Japrisot's style - enigmatic and intriguing.  This one made Charles Bronson a star even though its more a mystery than an action flick.

But I lived with it. My uncle recorded it off tv and it wasn't much better. A DVD was released I purchased in 2006, no good there . A miss. I purchased the sound track cd for the haunting music a large import sum of 60.00!!!! But it was worth it!!! As with this DVD release. THIS IS MY FAVORITE Bronson movie. Don't let this get away!!!! I still watch my old copy just take in the old memories of this film. I purchased the movie poster as well. GET THIS DVD !!!! Enjoy it.",1491523200,,630,4.048
