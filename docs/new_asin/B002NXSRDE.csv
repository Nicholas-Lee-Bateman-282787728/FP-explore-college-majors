3960519,5,B002NXSRDE,"Madeleine is such a great and unique artist that I would recommend her to anyone that likes music.  Upon hearing her voice and music for the first time, we immediately knew we had to have everything that she has ever done, and we did.  This is a little gem of a concert with amazing musicians in a very intimate setting.  This woman is so good that she does not need any fluff or gimmicks around her.  If you are looking for something grand, then look no further.",1372982400,,463,4.287356321839081

3960521,5,B002NXSRDE,"Last year I bought my first Madeleine Peyroux CD, ""Careless Love"". It's such a lovely recording that I eagerly searched for a concert by her on blu ray video. With non available I settled for ""Somethin' Grand"" on standard DVD.

This concert by the French American artist was recorded in Los Angeles in 2009. It features four songs (""Dance me to the end"", ""Don't wait too long"", ""You're gonna make me lonesome"", and ""Between the bars"") from the CD. She is backed on stage by an excellent strings band.

With a total of 17 songs this delightful concert is on the whole more folksy than the CD and worth owning. Audio and video are both excellent.",1328659200,3,644,4.543103448275862
3960522,5,B002NXSRDE,"This DVD really is something grand. It features a concert in a Los Angeles club and includes five videos of acoustic songs and a documentary.
Madeleine Peyroux was born in Athens Georgia in 1974. At the age of 13 she moved to Paris and became a street singer. In her first solo album Dreamland, released in 1997 with a cover of Edith Piaf's signature song La Vie en Rose and Patsy Cline's Walkin' After Midnight, she sounds like the reincarnation of Billie Holiday. Her next album Careless Love (2004) opens with a cover of Leonard Cohen's  Dance Me To The End of Love and includes Josephine Baker's J'ai Deux Amours and Bob Dylan's You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You're Gone. In 2006 Half the Perfect World was released with more covers, followed by Bare Bones in 2009, which includes some of her own compositions.
Peyroux is the most talented jazz singer to appear in many years. I would love to see as her next offering a Live in Paris DVD/CD combo with mostly French songs, unlike Diana Krall's all English concert in Paris.",1267920000,14,1032,4.608695652173913
3960523,5,B002NXSRDE,"Madeleine Peyroux's DVD performance is kind of very grown-up blue. Nice, ballady slow swing. I've listened to Madeleine since her first CD recording of 1996 (Dreamland). She made me wait a lifetime until her next release, which came at the end of the century. Anyone who has read about her singing life knows that she has been singing for most of her life - in those cities around the world where they love jazz and blues - and learning along the way. It's evident in her maturity of talent. She plays excellent guitar,  but you'd never know it because her primary quality is her shyness. Everything she does is shy, yet wide-eyed and willing. Madeleine has a musical intelligence that nearly glares at you, but she restrains that genius and turns it into a precious gift. I think the giving part of her music is inextricable from its sound.

This performance (though a tad self-conscious for being a DVD performance) is a wonderful gift from Madeleine.

Sometimes - no, often - the camera gets too close, in too tight. It's unnecessary: with your eyes closed you know she doesn't wear glitter and gloss make-up.",1266969600,23,1112,4.721649484536083
3960524,5,B002NXSRDE,"I am shocked to be writing the first review....
I stumbled onto this DVD today and remembering how much I enjoyed her first album a few years back grabbed it!

Madeleine sings in a style that reminds me of Billie Holiday and accompanies herself on a small bodied acoustic guitar playing fingerstyle ...and very well at that!

I find her phrasing and voice so unique and of another time and yet totally fresh.

I would imagine if Madeleine were a bit more photogenic I wouldn't be the first reviewer and she'd be much more popular which is a sad state of our current society. Goodness, where would Ella Fitzgerald be today? Oh...she would be endorsing Jenny Craig and showing up on reality TV shows...instead of making hundreds of classic recordings.  But lets get back to this DVD...a wonderfully filmed show a bit over an hour is joined by a very interesting documentary and a sensationally revealing acoustic set!!! Great Artist and GREAT value for money.",1265414400,11,957,4.781818181818182
8375567,5,B002NXSRDE,"Terrific biography terrific music. Enjoyed both very much, a very talented lady.",1519516800,,80,5.75
8375568,5,B002NXSRDE,"Watch the documentary ""Somethin' Grand"" first, as it is worth the price of admission all by itself.  It includes interviews with her mother in Paris, voice coach Joan Lader, the man who discovered her, Yves Beauvais, Larry Klein her long time producer, WSJ music critic Christopher J. Farley, and mentor and fellow Paris street musician Danny Fitzgerald.  This is not a fluff film, it is a serious, insightful portrait of one of the most important young artists to emerge in the past 2 decades.  Believe that after seeing this documentary the live performance will mean more, much more to the attentive listener.  Really ten stars would not cover it.",1478390400,3,650,4.935779816513762

8375576,3,B002NXSRDE,"After reading the previous reviews I was really expecting Something Grand. Billie holiday s voice, and step away Diana Krall were some comments. I think some people got excited too quick.

  Is she good yes but no more her voice really is average she never sings a high note always pretty much on the same tone. BUT when she sang in French Wow the voice changed completly and that was nice. Unfortunately two songs only.

  The musicians with her are excellent I especially like the organ  + the piano. Loved the instrumental of the songs better than with vocals sometimes.  Good show but not as fantastic as described by others. For fans only maybe or with average expectation you will enjoy but please stop the comparison with others.",1391731200,3,736,4.6953125
