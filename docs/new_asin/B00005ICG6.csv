They do a very good job covering a few of the games, but they stopped w/ the UNFORGETTABLE game against the Rams @ RJS! Either that or I fell asleep while watching the tape (which is unlikely). What about the last game of the season and the playoff?? Oh well, to tell you the truth, I'm very disappointed regarding *all* the NFL films I have. Come on, how can someone turn a whole season into a 25-minute tape?? Very disappointing... But again, if you want to improve your Buccaneers library, you should buy the tape. At least the material that they have is very good. Another disappointing aspect is that they don't give you the final results of every game or any kind of statistics. Pretty sad...",1001635200,,788,4.441379310344828
