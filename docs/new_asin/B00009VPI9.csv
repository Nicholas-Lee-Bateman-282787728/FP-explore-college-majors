7993203,5,B00009VPI9,"The main value of ""Charlie Chaplin's Keystone Comedies"" is that you get the first two film comedies made by the great silent comedian when he came to the United States at the end of 1913 and started working for Mack Sennett's Keystone studio.  Up to that point Chaplin had been a successful music hall comedian, but was a complete unknown to movie audiences.  But in 1914, working for Keystone, he was on his way to becoming the most popular movie star in the world:

""Making a Living"" (Released February 2, 1914), also released and re-released as ""Doing His Best,"" ""Take My Picture,"" ""Troubles,"" and ""A Busted Johnny,"" was Chaplin's first work for Keystone.  He does not play the beloved Tramp at this point, but rather a ""sharper"" who is a rival of the character played by director Henry Lehrman.  After panhandling Lehrman, Chaplin steals the girl (Virginia Kirtley) and there are lots of slapstick fights.  The problem is that given this is Charlie Chaplin's American debut it is really unimpressive given the greatness that is to come.  Chaplin never thought it was particularly funny, especially since all of the elaborate comic business he developed for the film ended up on the cutting room floor.

Chaplin's second Keystone outing, ""Kid's Auto Race in Venice"" (Released February 7, 1914), takes place at the track of a Soap Box Derby.  Written and directed by Lehrman, who plays the film director in the comedy, this one has Chaplin as a tramp who keeps getting in the way of the cameraman trying to film the kids racing their cars.  Chaplin's scene stealing is really all there is to this one, which supposedly was improvised on site and filmed in less than an hour.  Where the comedy was rather innovative was that it was one of the first self-reflexive films in movie history.

""A Busy Day"" (Released May 7, 1914) was Chaplin's 14th Keystone comedy is the first of a trio of films in which Charlie appears as a woman (the other two are ""The Masquerader"" for Keystone and ""A Woman"" for Essanay).  The difference is that here Chaplin is really playing a female character, married to Mack Swain.  The reason for this becomes clear when the other woman (Phyllis Allen) shows up, because the jealous wife is going to launch a full slapstick attack on her husband when the battle axe catches him philandering.

Chaplin's 19th Keystone comedy, ""Mabel's Married Life"" (Released June 20, 1914) ostensibly stars Mabel Normand, with Chaplin as her ineffectual husband.  Previous the two had made ""Mabel at the Wheel"" and ""Mabel's Busy Day,"" where Charlie played the villain.  The film also has Mr. Wellington (Mack Swain) and his wife (Alice Howell), and the contrast is between the two married couples.  Mabel wants her husband to be more aggressive, which he becomes after getting drunk.  Mrs. Wellington wants to believe her husband is faithful to her, but she is wrong for different reasons.  The comic high point is Chaplin's encounter with the dummy that Mabel buys that looks like Wellington.  Historically this comedy is of note because from this point forward Chaplin directed all of his comedies, with the exception being ""Tillie's Punctured Romance,"" an ambitious six-reeler directed by Sennett himself.

""Laughing Gas"" (Released July 9, 1914) was Chaplin's 20th comedy for Keystone. This one-reeler written and directed by Chaplin has Charlie as the assistant to a dentist, Dr. Pain (Fritz Schade). The dentist administers laughing gas to a patient, extracts a tooth, and finds he cannot wake up the old man, and gets Charlie to help. Most of the comedy here has to do with Charlie's accidental and deliberate mistreatment of not only the patients, but also his rival assistant as well. The point is to have fun at the expense of other characters, especially the serious ones like Mack Swain's man outside the pharmacy. This is not the beloved Tramp of later Chaplin comedies, since the assistant can be malicious and even sadistic, especially with those big pliers. Moreover, the frantic pace of the action in this one-reeler is certainly representative of the Sennett approach to comedy at Keystone than the sublime blend of comedy and pathos offered in Chaplin's best work.

""The New Janitor"" (Released September 24, 1914) is the 27th of thirty-three comedies for Keystone.  Chaplin wrote and directed this one, taking seventeen days to make it at a time while comedies like ""A Busy Day"" were shot in a couple of hours.  Chaplin is the janitor, whose job is made difficult by the elevator operator at an office building, while the manager (Jack Dillon) ia being threatened by Luke Connor.  Meanwhile, Charlie is in love with the stenographer (Minta Durfee), who is in love with the manager, who ends up robbing the safe, for which Charlie gets blamed.  This one actually has a happy ending.  Eventually Chaplin would remake this one reeler as the two-reeler ""The Bank"" for Essanay in 1915.

There is no way of knowing how close any of these versions are to being definitive.  Extant scripts for Chaplin's Keystone comedies do not exist and you can never be certain of having seen the most complete print of any of them, but you will certainly get a sense of what Chaplin and Sennett were up to at this point.  It would be nice if these Keystone films were restored, and now that the Essanay and Mutual comedies have been done and most of the United Artist feature films, hopefully they will be next.  So while the quality of these early Chaplin comedies leaves something to be desired, they do represent an above average sampling, starting with his historic first film comedies and ending with what is arguably the best of his work at Keystone.",1101686400,3,5660,4.863541666666666
