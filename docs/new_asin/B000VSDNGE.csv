ESPAOL:
  Dame Chocolate fue una telenovela de muchsimo xito  que atrajo a un publico enorme a travs de los Estados Unidos.  Esta historia muy original, escrita por Perla Ferias, se trate una joven Mexicana llamada Rosita Amado (Gnesis Rodrguez).  Rosita es muy humilde y muy buena, pero la pobre tambin es increblemente fea y ingenua.  Muy pronto, la vida de la Rosita y su familia cambian cuando Juan Amado (Hctor Suarez), el abuelo de Rosita, muere.  Juan tenia una fabrica de chocolates en Miami y al morir, el dejo a su nieta encargada de la receta secreta del chocolate mgico.  Rosita y su familia se van a vivir a los Estados Unidos para mantener a la fabrica de Juan, pero para una familia que ha vivido en la pobreza toda su vida - esto es un gran cambio!  Desafortunadamente, Juan Amado no era el nico dueo de Chocolate Supremo.  Grace Remington (Kristina Lilley) y su hijo, Bruce Remington (Carlos Ponce), tambin son dueos de la fabrica.  Y aunque Rosita y Bruce empiezan a sentir sentimientos por cada uno, Grace se siente superior a ellos y esta dispuesta a hacer todo -incluso matar- por conseguir la receta secreta y sacar a los Amados de Amrica.  Las cosas se ponen peor cuando ngel Prez (Khotan), un malvado hombre de Mxico que Rosita cree ser su amigo, tambin llega a los Estados Unidos y se ala con Grace.  Despus de emocin, confusin, y traicin, todos dan a Rosita por muerta despus de un incidente trgico...pero ella a regresado como Violeta Hurtado.  Ahora, una Rosita mucho mas inteligente lleva puesta la mascara de belleza para vengarse de los Remington y recuperar la fabrica de su abuelo Juan.  Ella tiene una nueva receta de chocolate, y una nueva receta para el amor...
  Lo que hizo esta novela mas popular que las miles otras que haban en el momento (aparte de su final completamente inesperado) era la imaginacin que tuvo la escritora.  Dame Chocolate combina el romance con el misterio y el suspenso con la fantasia.  Esta no es una novela comn e corriente porque hay religin y cultura Maya involucrados en esta produccin.  Hay bastante suspenso y humor, y a la mitad de la serie, la novela toma un giro extraordinario que solo sigue demonstrando que buena fue esta novela.  Maria Antonieta de las Nieves (actriz del famoso programa de Chespirito, ""El Chavo del Ocho"") y Mauricio Ochmann actuan en este obra de arte clsica.  Dame Chocolate es una novela muy bien escrita que merece ser comprada por TODOS los fanticos (los hombres tambien) que la vieron en televisin, y por gente que disfruta ver buenas historias.  Cinco de cinco!

ENGLISH:
  Dame Chocolate (""Give Me Chocolate"") was a very successful soap opera that attracted a large public across the United States.  This original story, written by Perla Ferias, is about a young Mexican woman named Rosita Amado (Gnesis Rodrguez).  Rosita is very humble and very nice, but she's incredibly ugly and extremely oblivious.  Soon enough, everything changes for Rosita and her family when Juan Amado (Hctor Suarez), Rosita's grandfather, passes away.  Juan had a chocolate factory in Miami and when he died, he left his granddaughter in charge of the secret formula for the magic chocolate.  Rosita and her family move to the United States to maintain Juan's chocolate factory running, but this is a big change for a family who's lived in poverty all their life!  Unfortunately, Juan Amado wasn't the only owner of the factory Chocolate Supremo (Supreme Chocolate).  Grace Remington (Kristina Lilley) and her son, Bruce Remington (Carlos Ponce), are also owners of the factory.  And even though Rosita and Bruce start having feelings for each other, Grace's feeling of superiority gets the best of her and she intends to steal the secret formula and kick the Amados out of America and back into Mexico.  She id even willing to kill... Things start to worsen when ngel Prez (Khotan), a bad guy from Mexico that Rosita mistakenly considers her friend, follows her into the U.S. and befriends the evil Grace.  After emotions, confusion, and betrayal, everyone believes Rosita to be dead after a quite tragic incident...but she is alive and is now back to seek revenge on the Remingtons.  Now a clever Rosita, now disguised as the beautiful Violeta Hurtado, is determined to win back her grandfather's factory and punish those who humiliated her for her intelligence and ugliness.  She has a new recipe for chocolate and new recipe for love...
  What made this particular soap opera so much more popular than the other millions of soaps out there (besides its totally cool, totally unexpected ending) was the imagination of the author.  Dame Chocolate combines romance with mystery and suspense with fantasy.  This is not your ordinary soap opera, as Mayan culture and magic make their own appearance in this popular show.  There's a lot of suspense and humor in this series, and then plot takes an unexpected turning point with its own twist that only further proves how good this story is.  Maria Antonieta de las Nieves (an actress from Chespirito's famous Spanish TV show, ""El Chavo del Ocho"") and Mauricio Ochmann participate in this classic.  Dame Chocolate is very well written and deserves to be bought by those who watched it on TV, and for those who enjoy watching a good show - men, too!  5/5 stars!",1191542400,27,5338,4.853982300884955

2947928,4,B000VSDNGE,"Dame Chocolate (Give Me Chocolate - 780 minutes)

 Many telenovelas teach us about various industries in Mexico. This one is about making candy. Our heroine is a chica muy feo but her family doesn't mind her horrible nose and her buck teeth. She is sweet-natured and seems to worship a god that is associated with chocolate.

Her long-absent grandfather comes back to Mexico after spending many years in Miami where he is affiliated with a very successful (chocolate) candy factory. Because she is his heir, when he dies she ends up in Miami and quickly realizes she will be judged by her looks, so adopts a veil that she uses when she makes her appearance at the factory. When she realizes that her looks will be used to blackmail her, she courageously ditches the veil and appears as herself.

The wealthy woman who owns the factory realizes that our heroine is the sole holder of the secret ingredient, so she assigns her handsome son the task of seducing her and obtaining the recipe. Our little ugly duckling falls for him, hook, line, and sinker!

In the meantime, as the son is reeling her into his clutches, he falls in love with her. By the time the wedding day rolls around, he's eager to be married to her but his mother convinces her it was a scheme.

Our poor broken-hearted chica flees and ends up in Los Angeles, where she becomes a reluctant contestant in a make-over reality TV show, which of course she wins. She pockets her winnings, adopts a new name, and goes back to Miami to settle the score. When she files a lawsuit, things get lively!

Expect many rounds of ""Who's Your Daddy?"" murder attempts, unrequited love, prison sentences and kidnappings, but expect our dauntless gal to somehow prevail. I never saw the original telenovela, so the missing parts don't bother me. I got my DVD from Amazon.",1379548800,,1821,4.654205607476635

This review concerns the fact that the product received is not what I expected, by any stretch of the imagination. I only wish I had read the reviews of this product BEFORE I bought it. If I had, I would never have bothered. This is an abridged version of the Novela. It is SO abridged that it is nearly unrecognizable.

I have been hesitant to buy it for a long time but when an uncle told met to treat myself and not use the money he gave me for anything else I took a chance and boy was I glad I did.  The lead actor is amazing and watching the Bloopers is a must espceically the last few especially for the women.
The end isn't typical of other Novelas witch is nice but I was kind of hoping for the a typical lavish ++++++ at the end.  Sorry I won't give it away and if you love Dame Chocolate as much as I did try watching Marimar with Thalia similar story lines and tough choices and very much alike.

Overall, the series itself is AWESOME, but the DVD hacks it to pieces.  In my opinion, nothing should have been edited and the series should have been sold as a whole.

Dame Chocolate combines romance with mystery and suspense with fantasy.  This is not your ordinary soap opera, as Mayan culture and magic make their own appearance in this popular show.  There's a lot of suspense and humor in this series, and then plot takes an unexpected turning point with its own twist that only further proves how good this story is.  Maria Antonieta de las Nieves (an actress from Chespirito's famous Spanish TV show, ""El Chavo del Ocho"") and Mauricio Ochmann participate in this classic.  Dame Chocolate is very well written and deserves to be bought by those who watched it on TV, and for those who enjoy watching a good show - men, too!  5/5 stars!",1191542400,27,5338,4.853982300884955

3182425,4,B000VSDNGE,"Dame Chocolate (Give Me Chocolate - 780 minutes)

 Many telenovelas teach us about various industries in Mexico. This one is about making candy. Our heroine is a chica muy feo but her family doesn't mind her horrible nose and her buck teeth. She is sweet-natured and seems to worship a god that is associated with chocolate.

Her long-absent grandfather comes back to Mexico after spending many years in Miami where he is affiliated with a very successful (chocolate) candy factory. Because she is his heir, when he dies she ends up in Miami and quickly realizes she will be judged by her looks, so adopts a veil that she uses when she makes her appearance at the factory. When she realizes that her looks will be used to blackmail her, she courageously ditches the veil and appears as herself.

The wealthy woman who owns the factory realizes that our heroine is the sole holder of the secret ingredient, so she assigns her handsome son the task of seducing her and obtaining the recipe. Our little ugly duckling falls for him, hook, line, and sinker!

In the meantime, as the son is reeling her into his clutches, he falls in love with her. By the time the wedding day rolls around, he's eager to be married to her but his mother convinces her it was a scheme.

Our poor broken-hearted chica flees and ends up in Los Angeles, where she becomes a reluctant contestant in a make-over reality TV show, which of course she wins. She pockets her winnings, adopts a new name, and goes back to Miami to settle the score. When she files a lawsuit, things get lively!

Expect many rounds of ""Who's Your Daddy?"" murder attempts, unrequited love, prison sentences and kidnappings, but expect our dauntless gal to somehow prevail. I never saw the original telenovela, so the missing parts don't bother me. I got my DVD from Amazon.",1379548800,,1821,4.654205607476635

The lead actor is amazing and watching the Bloopers is a must espceically the last few especially for the women.
The end isn't typical of other Novelas witch is nice but I was kind of hoping for the a typical lavish ++++++ at the end.  Sorry I won't give it away and if you love Dame Chocolate as much as I did try watching Marimar with Thalia similar story lines and tough choices and very much alike.

Unfortunately, I came to the game a bit late and the only way I could see any of the Telenovelas was to watch the US DVD releases. Every one I've seen on DVD were ""abridged"" versions. Editing quite a bit of the show out for the release. Which, I don't really understand. I think it would take quite a bit longer to figure out what to edit to make the story somewhat watchable than it would just to release the show in it's entirety.
The editing wasn't as bad as I've read in other reviews. The stuff they cut that made some of it confusing was easy to figure out. Which is interesting to me because if the wiki page is correct, when it aired there were 150 forty-five minute episodes and on the DVD there are 30 thirty minute episodes.
I watched this because I think of Gnesis Rodrguez as one of (if not the) most fascinating people on the planet ever since I saw her in ""Man On A Ledge"".
I would love to see Dame Chocolate in it's entirety and I would buy it. (As long as it's subtitled in English) But from the release history of Telenovelas on DVD, I doubt I ever will. I'd also like to see  Gnesis' other Telenovelas (""Prisonera"" & ""Doa Brbara"") on DVD. Even if they were the heavily edited/""abridged"" versions.
