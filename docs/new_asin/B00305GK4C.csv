8385491,5,B00305GK4C,"This wonderfully directed story of Casey Puckett allows us to see how an athlete at this elite level is still vulnerable to insecurity, to injury, and to disappointment.

But it also shows an incredible amount of perseverance and the kind of drive not everyone has. It just goes to show you that if you keep forging ahead, despite the obstacles or challenges you face...you too can do it. Thank you for sharing this amazingly done story of Casey Puckett. I'm rooting for him!",1263168000,,475,4.72289156626506
8385492,5,B00305GK4C,Appointment in Vancouver shows what it takes emotionally and physically to make it to the Olympic level.  The superior photography and storytelling drew me into the entire experience and has prepared me to root for Casey Puckett --GO CASEY!,1262822400,2,240,5.153846153846154
8385493,5,B00305GK4C,"We, too, received this incredible DVD of remarkable Casey Puckett and his quest for the Gold in
his fifth Winter Olympics.  Our family (aged 22-61)  were all on the edge of our seats watching
the action on screen and we were rooting out loud as he would be in the lead and groaning in
unison when he would crash.  We will all be watching Casey at his Appointment in Vancouver next month.
We hope to see more of Casey and more from the video's director.  It was done with the facts, the friends and
a lot of emotion all mixed in.  Excellent!",1262649600,2,540,4.254901960784314
8385494,5,B00305GK4C,Wow! What an exciting new Olympic sport!!! Awesome! I am going to follow Casey as he goes to the next X game and see how he does and if he can make it to the Olympics. Exciting footage!! Highly recommend for the Olympic buff or Skier. In fact good film for young racers to understand the mental edge you must have to complete.,1262649600,2,326,4.190476190476191
8385495,5,B00305GK4C,"We were fortunate to receive a copy of a wonderful documentary DVD for Christmas, enjoyed watching it, and have shared it with friends who ski.  Other than this is a totally driven guy who nearly kills himself repeatedly to reach his dream, what can I say?  Oh, yeah.  There are a few cameo shots of a really cool former student of Casey's.....

Great story-telling on the part of the film's Director, and a compelling personal drama.  Gosh!  How can you not be rooting for Casey in Vancouver?

And can you NOT be rooting for the DIRECTOR of such a wonderful, fascinating documentary??",1262304000,2,585,4.676470588235294
8385496,5,B00305GK4C,"Casey Puckett may not be a household name today, but in a month or so, everyone should know who he is.  This engrossing sports documentary is a wonderful profile of this amazing athlete.  A vet of 4 Olympics, heading for his 5th, Casey's perseverance and dedication is enthralling.  After seeing the doc, I can't wait to see how he does at the Vancouver Olympics!  A must-see for fans of winter Olympics, skiing, and athletics in general!",1261958400,,438,4.723684210526316
