Most of the Warriors episodes Ive seen discuss matters from the recent past.  This time the show discusses matters from more than 1,300 years ago.  Like many programs on the ancient Maya, this asks, Why did they disappear?  Like most episodes, you learn historical facts, not just info on weapons and battles.  This may appeal to us dove viewers.  The facts have nothing to do with the Spanish or other Europeans.  Thats radically different from how Apocolypto ended.
The host is a Navy SEAL and likens himself to all the warriors he covers.  To some, this may feel essentialist.  However, theres something about it that comes off as multicultural and anti-racist.  Many veterans rave about their time in the military precisely because it exposed them to peoples they would have otherwise never met, both within the ranks and in military sites all over the globe.  There are some ancestors of the ancient Maya here, but not as many living descendants as one saw in the Hawaii or Zulu episodes.
Again, theres other matters here for doves.  The work discussed Mayan architecture.  It notes that only the Mayans had writing in the pre-colonial Western Hemisphere.  Viewers who enjoy this show may also want to see Cracking the Mayan Code.",1431129600,2,1328,4.848888888888889
