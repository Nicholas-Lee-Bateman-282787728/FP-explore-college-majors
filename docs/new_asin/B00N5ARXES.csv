8676367,2,B00N5ARXES,"A group of young adults go to a cabin in the woods...cue spinner... and we get slasher.  In this case the slasher is fully known as a veteran who escaped from the law (Robert Hackworth) although he looks about 15 years too young for the role...just go with it.

Our cabin dwellers have their own issues and squabbles  in an attempt to make a film out this formula. Their characters were weak, but more importantly, the slasher was an unimaginative bore.  The dialog didn't take us anywhere.  A drowning, some throat slices and a shot to the head. Yawn.

May work as an inexpensive rental.
