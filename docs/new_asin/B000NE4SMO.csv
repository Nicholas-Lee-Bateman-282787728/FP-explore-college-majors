2767592,3,B000NE4SMO,"I have some fond memories of watching The Midnight Special back in the late '70's and seeing some of my rock heroes performing live. As this was the pre-MTV era we weren't that accustomed to seeing rock acts on TV all that often, so consequently it was a genuine cause for excitement to catch rock stars of the day like Ted Nugent, Aerosmith, Heart, Kiss, etc live on the Midnight Special. With the passage of time however we tend to forget just how much crap was also shown on the show. For every good rock act we saw on the show there were usually 3 or 4 horrid disco performers. For every great blues legend there were usually a half-dozen sugar-coated radio acts of the day like Andy Gibb, Olivia Newton John, Helen Reddy, The Captain & Tennille, etc. When They decided to open the vaults and release these Midnight Special performances on DVD they had a great opportunity to please everyone by sorting the performances according to musical style... rock acts like Aerosmith, Ted Nugent, Kiss, Golden Earrring, etc on one disk, disco acts like KC & The Sunshine Band and The Bee Gees on another disk, MOR acts like Helen Reddy and Glen Campbell on another disk, etc. Instead, they chose to sort the acts according to year, which means you get a ridiculous mixed bag of performers of opposing musical styles on one DVD. So for example, in the case of the 1975 DVD, if you love KISS then you'll likely hate The Bee Gees and KC & The Sunshine Band and vice versa. And if you like Glen Campbell then you'll probably dislike ALL of the above. In other words, these DVD's have something for *everyone* to hate!",1189123200,27,1608,4.510273972602739
2767593,2,B000NE4SMO,"The plot is rather simplistic and it is an epic slow tale of a human/nom-human hybrid boy who just wants to phone home and be with his own people with glowing eyes and innerglowingness. There is enough alluded to in the movie that you can piece together what it's about. While it won't surprise you that it costed more money to make than what the movie got in box office sales; it is surprising however  that Rotten Tomatoes rates this at 83%. If this title weren't at my local library branch, I would have never seen it.",1516924800,,521,4.371134020618556
2767594,4,B000NE4SMO,"I never saw this when it was first released and watched it for the first time last night. What a great low budget Sci-Fi film with great emotional development.

2767596,5,B000NE4SMO,"This isn't a special effects film built on a simplistic plot. It's a though provoking theme for people who like to think and discover ideas on their own.

2767597,4,B000NE4SMO,"I enjoyed this movie in it's entirety. The entire cast acted wonderfully. This movie is very tense through the first 2 acts. The third act (or rather, the ending) was great. I had fun watching.",1515024000,,193,4.542857142857143

2767600,1,B000NE4SMO,"Great acting couldn't save this movie which had a straight line plot to a pointless, nothing ending. The movie seemed particularly slow because the plot was so straight and smooth with neither branches nor curves, and yet had 112 minutes to get to there. Where is there? There is the disappointing conclusion before which the movie treats the FBI as an army of soulless, heavy handed morons moving as one in lacking even a modicum of curiosity about the events or their assignment and treats the parishioners of the church as a flock of sheep. Very unrealistic in both cases. Yes, as a matter of fact, I'm glad you asked! Yes, I could do better if you gave me Michael Shannon, Joel Edgerton, Kirsten Dunst, and $18,000,000.",1511481600,,723,4.700787401574803

2767606,2,B000NE4SMO,"I thought the setup for this movie was misleading. Was led to believe that this was the story of a boy with superpowers on a world not ready for a superhero. Instead, he's just an annoying brat from a cloaked super-city that is super-imposed over our reality. There is a big effect he does at the end of the movie to return home, and you realize he could have done this at the very start of the movie, without all the dozens killed, maimed, shot, and otherwise abused.

Probably the dumbest part of the movie is that we are expected to believe this boy is happy with an outcome where everyone he knew gets long prison terms, and his mother is forced to change her appearance and be on the run for the rest of her life, while the ""super people"" watched from their cloaked city and LAUGH at all the suffering they caused.

The movie has more plot loop holes than can be counted. The biggest is why the kid has the ability to sense ALL DANGER at the end of the movie, reading the minds of soldiers complete with the proper responses to avoid being shot at, yet there were about 1,000 opportunities for this kid to show off this particular power beforehand, as the movie unfolded.

They claim the boy never saw a sunriset, but this implies his mother never walked around during sunlight with the baby? What prior ""fit"" caused the family members to never want him to be in sunlight? They have a government official sarcastically not believing the story of the state trooper. Didn't the entire population of Florida (plus Georgia and Alabama) witness cloaked super-cities on every horizon in every direction? That's a heckuva lot of people that need covered up.

It was never explained why the government was so adamant that the kid not get to his destination. If the kid could open and start up a car with his mind (as he escaped with the Sith Lord from The Force Awakens), why didn't he just rotor up a helicopter and fly where he needed to go?

It seems to me that this awful brat put an awful lot of people through hell, never explained why, and spent his time channeling Spanish radio stations rather than offering any explanations. The adults seemed brainwashed. He'd show them a little lightshow, and suddenly they became murderous monsters who'd be willing to kill to drive him to location X. (It was never specified where the church was trying to relocate him to, the Joel Osteen Show?) And what on Earth happened to the preacher played by Sam Shepherd? Just an opening red herring as the entire movie turned out to be.

The movie had good production values, although I don't know why everyone sat in the dark the whole movie, even when the kid was far away. It had a better feel to it than last year's big budget ""Arrival"", which had an even dumber ending. But not by much. Glad I didn't see it in the theater, wish I had two hours back. And I wish the government had put this brat down with an armed drone strike rather than make everyone chase him around for no reason. And when is the government going to contact these freeloader super-people, living off our planet's resources without paying rent? Stupid kid, stupid freeloader super-city, stupid movie.",1504569600,,3161,4.536842105263158

2767618,5,B000NE4SMO,"This film has quickly made it to my top 10 list. Fast paced with a plot that keeps you guessing all the way to the end.it has a stellar cast. The performances were strong and believable. Especially Michael Shannon. I've really never seen a bad performance from him. I think the ending is open to interpretation, which may not be satisfying for everyone. However it doesn't take away from the greatness of the work as a whole.

Spoiler alert

The only thing about the ending that I really wish I could  ask the filmmaker about,  is the scene with Michael Shannon watching the sunrise. You briefly see a blue light in his eyes like Alton's. Is the father from the other world? That would explain how the boy was born on earth. I wish it hadn't ended without more answers, but I still enjoyed it immensely.",1497916800,,803,4.47945205479452

2767641,5,B000NE4SMO,"Wow! I was not expecting this at all. This director, Jeff Nichols, is a talent whose name you need to file away to keep an eye on. The story blows you away as it combines a Waco-like religious cult, Orwellian government agencies and a very unique alien world...that resides on top of our current world on Earth...and is also one of the all-time best chase movies. Throw in the heartwrenching family push-and-pull, this is one of the most unqiue movies ever made.

Now Michael Shannon is such a great actor in anything he's in. I mean, who is better with just a look or a few choice words? Throw in the kid from St. Vincent, a Fargo-revived Kirsten Dunst, the Aussie dude (Joel Edgerton) from Animal Kingdo, Kylo Ren as an FBI profiler and even Sam Shepherd in a strong important cameo as the cult leader and this is a near-perfect cast.

The extras are good. Each main character gets a profile rundown. Then there's an explanation of how the Unseen World came about.",1485302400,,966,4.545977011494253

Two men abduct an 8-year-old boy from a religious cult, and the three of them flee from cult members and FBI agents chasing them on the back roads of Texas. But theres a catch: The boy is a willing participant in his own abduction, and the trio have a plan and an unspoken goal. Its all very tense and mysterious. And then the story goes all Kid with Supernatural Powers on us and gets sillier and sillier until, at the films climax, I was thinking of Disney theme parks and Tinker Bell  a far cry from the dark and suspenseful first hour.

2767669,3,B000NE4SMO,"This one is about a father and son on the run from government agents and members of a misguided religious cult led by Sam Shephard.  The boy has strange powers so the government views him as a dangerous weapon and the cult as a sort of messiah.  The boy his father and another man sleep during the day, carefully blacking out any windows so the boy isn't exposed to sunlight.  The boy wears tinted goggles that honesty seem to do little to no good but are apparently meant to help him control his powers.

Midnight Special borrows from Brian DePalma's The Fury (or Stephen King's Firestarter, take your pick) and, strangely, Disney's Escape to Witch Mountain.  It isn't the thrilling piece of genre fare that people were hoping for based on the trailer and advance hype from midnight berths at film festivals.  The problem is that writer/director Jeff Nichols isn't a genuine popcorn filmmaker--he's an indie drama guy at heart playing with genre elements.  Unfortunately, he doesn't manage to stage a single genuinely exciting sequence in terms of action or suspense.

That isn't to say that Midnight Special is a bust exactly--it's never less than interesting and features impeccable performances from the cast including Michael Shannon, Joel Edgerton and Kirsten Dunst.  Jaeden Lieberher has an appropriately otherworldly quality as the child the various characters are after or trying to protect, but it's the adult actors who do the dramatic heavy lifting.

I'm guessing some people will be more moved and impressed with Midnight Special than I was.  I came to the film expecting something entirely different and the lack of any actual thrills made this a disappointment for me.  But if indie drama sci-fi fantasy is actually what you are looking for, then Midnight Special probably delivers the goods.",1480550400,,1807,5.006688963210703

2767676,5,B000NE4SMO,"This movie had a beautiful, still darkness about it that really moved me. It is about a boy, Jaeden Lieberher, with special powers who does not quite belong on this earth, and his father, Michael Shannon, who is trying to protect him. There is a religious cult that thinks he is their saviour as well as the US government trying to hunt him down. Most of this movie takes place in the car in gritty shots of Southern back roads. The music is intense and haunting and really adds depth to the film. One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Lieberher's (St. Vincent) performance was wise and calm beyond his years and the performances by his parents Shannon and Kirsten Dunst were so moving. If you are a fan of Nichols' other films Mud and Take Shelter, you will love this. He is one of the best film makers of this generation.",1478908800,,834,4.352564102564102

2767709,4,B000NE4SMO,"Jeff Nichols slow burn intensity(Viz:-Mud and take Shelter) sci-fi chase thriller is an apocalyptic drama set in a naturalistic environment. About a boy with mysterious powers featuring Michael Shannon,Joel Edgerton, Kirsten Dunst, Sam Shepherd, Adam Driver, drawn into a Close Encounters-style film echoing 80s Speilberg and Carpenter movies. Nichols provides a withholding narrative: two men escape with their messianic prodigy from a cult, chased by cult members and government federal agents and an NSA geek. The cult run by Sam Shepherd has stockpiled weapons and they need Alton the child to help them with the groups salvation on March 6th. The feds think that Alton is a weapon and they want to capture him and analyse the phenomenon. He has the power to bring down satellites and has the inhuman ability to decode heavily encrypted transmissions. Roy (Shannon) will stop at nothing to keep his son from harm and uncover the truth behind his unbelievable powers. Nichols film shows people put a lot of faith in things they don't understand. The film is also asking is it about being good or a good parent? As Lucas says  good people who believe die every day. Alton is born (human) with a natural ability to transcend and therefore is able to show humanity the potential which his father is then, at the end, shown to begin realizing. This fits with the allegory in the film of the importance of parents being willing to support and release their children to express their own natural potentials rather than making them into what they (the parents or culture) want them to be. Roy would literally kill anybody who gets in his way.

Alton has a strange quiet gravitas(as of one who knows),Its alright Roy,Sit down Lucas. Theres a world on top of ours,where people like me live, people have been watching us for a long time. The boy comes from this other world. Is it another dimension?  What if Alton doesnt belong with us? his mother asks. I suspect that the others and Alton are more a reference to transcendence or realization of further human potential. Roy and Lucas are determined to drive Alton to a set of coordinates for an event that will occur on a date he has prophesied. As it becomes apparent during the course of the journey, Alton has incredible powers, including the ability to produce beams of light from his eyes, create power cuts and even brings satellites crashing down to Earth. Meanwhile, the military and armed cultists mount massive effort to capture Alton. The special effects are kept to a minimum; a monotonous drabness pervades every boarded-up interior. The underlying ideas give this film dynamic emotion, needing repeat watching to catch this. Dunsts Sarah provides the right counterbalance of emotional angst to her male counterparts. Jaden Lieberher is
superb in balancing the fragility of his worsening condition as Alton with his sense of his alternative destiny not of this earth. Lucas(Edgerton) portrays a staunch loyalty. This film succeeds in its use of night-time scenes, low rumbling electronic music, the spare beauty in its wide shots of dusty Texas roads, scrubby Louisiana fields and shabby tract houses. Shannon provides the steelyard stare of a titan. The apocalyptic ending and the curved city in the air, as beams of light lift Alton away.",1475798400,,3298,4.971014492753623

2767721,4,B000NE4SMO,"I rather liked this one. Lots of mystery and tension.

The film's odd mix of science fiction and religious cult tones actually worked quite well for me and made mystery extremely interesting. This sense of mystery and silent tension is the film's biggest strength. We are thrown right into the story with almost no exposition and it's immediately intriguing. I suppose this could also be a problem for some viewers. The details of this mystery are never fully explained. You get an answer, but those looking for a more exact explanation may be disappointed. The story leans more on the emotional impact of it's finale. It's also worth noting that acting is rather moving. I never quite found myself moved to tears, or anything like that, but the family dynamic between the main characters is moving and endearing.

Overall, an interesting and eerie mystery that might not answer all your questions, but has an emotionally impactful ending. Watch it. Or don't. Do what you want.",1474934400,,977,4.915151515151515

It does leave some unanswered questions but I feel that that's the beauty of this film.  It leaves you thinking. Movies now a days rely on flashy special effects and overacting with overly beautiful people that real people can't relate to. The cover photo to the DVD gives a glimpse into the story. Michael Shannon is such an amazing actor who loves and wants to protect his son and will go to any means necessary to do so.  I highly recommend.,1474416000,10,608,4.3628318584070795

2767767,3,B000NE4SMO,"Midnight Special is a slow paced movie, we're left in the dark for most of the movie as to what is going on, being dropped into a scene where a two guys smuggle a kid out of a cardboarded up hotel room and oddly park their car right in front of the hotel reception window so obviously the cops are called. Then the abductors (the father and his friend) decide not only not to switch cars, but that driving at night without headlights is a perfectly intelligent idea, because no ones going to call the cops about a car driving with no headlights, cops definitely don't pull over cars without headlights on, and idiots on one lane road coming the other direction don't ever stray across the middle lane if they think there is no oncoming traffic. Meanwhile a huge news coverage is happening because a father abducted his own child from a cult. A very well behaved cult, the FBI turn up and tell them to move their way in an orderly fashion to some buses they've got parked outside their compound and not only do we not have a violent resistance, no one even says, why should we, or argues about being told to fill out forms. We soon learn that Gremlins style, the abducted kid can't be exposed to sunlight. His eyes also light up like he has headlights in his eye sockets and he can make stuff crash to Earth from out of space. This should be cool you start to think, but he barely does anything else cool in the movie.

Spoilers - The movie also ends without really giving you any closure. The mother (Dunst) knows she is likely never to see her kid again (she tells the father this earlier in the movie) yet decides to stand a long way away from him admiring the architecture above her and never goes to his side to reassure him or tell him good luck or she'll miss him or anything.

The extras (on region 4) have backstories on all the main characters which really needed to be in the actual movie. A movie that goes for two hours almost, and should have had this stuff substituted for a lot of the boring pointless scenes in between anything interesting happening.",1472774400,,2066,4.377604166666667
2767768,4,B000NE4SMO,"Slow paced, like Ulee's Gold and Take Shelter (also Michael Shannon; could almost be the prequel to this movie).  However, as with those movies, patience will be rewarded.

***SPOILER ALERT***

I wish we could have actually spent some time in the boy's world, but I understand that was the climax of the film, and the visuals revealing said world were quite impressive, albeit quite brief.  But like Take Shelter, you discover that the actions of the protagonists (who seem early on to actually be the antagonists) were justified: the youngster wasn't from this world, and was unwillingly a danger to our world until he was safely in his own.

***END OF SPOILER ALERT***

I didn't think MS was as good as Take Shelter, although in TS the viewer doesn't really know for sure until the very end whether Michael Shannon's character has good reason for his actions.

On a side note, if you like the slow burners: Ulee's Gold just rocks, in that slow Pink Floyd way.  It slowly grows on you, keeps your interest in the characters, and then the viewers are rewarded for sticking with Ulee by witnessing what this quiet man is actually capable of, in order to protect his own.

'Nuff said.  Really liked this movie.  Just don't expect all action, all the time.  It comes, it goes.  It's more about the characters and discovering their motivations, with a decent payoff at the end.  Highly recommended for the patient viewer.

I must admit being impressed by the last fifteen minutes and intrigued by the last five seconds.  This is among the 1% of films that actually deserves a sequel.  There are obvious plot and tonal similarities to a few well known 1970's and 1980's films I won't name.  However, I think this is done very deliberately to prove the formula still has a few untraveled roads left.

What differentiates this one is the sense of desperation that permeates the pursuit - that's good writing. And Michael Shannon is really good as the desperate dad.

The first 10-15 minutes intrigued me with the interrogation of the cult by the FBI and NSA, but after about 15 minutes the movie fell flat and dry.  We know this child has some unbeknownst ""special powers"" after the FBI and NSA start the interrogation process, but many questions go unanswered.  The film is a cat and mouse chase across the state of Texas and into Louisiana between the government and cult abductors over who will get their hands on  the boy first.  Meanwhile you have a confused and mumbling Michael Shannon playing the role as his biological father doing whatever it takes to get the boy to his prophesied longitude/latitude coordinates.  The only small breath of fresh air was the NSA agent's character whom exuded a quirky attitude and affinity to understand the complexity of this boy.  Kirsten Dunst and Joel Edgerton outperformed Michael Shannon, but that didn't save this film.  We've seen much more successful sci-fi films throughout the years, and I find it hard to believe this will be added to that list, but then again people get caught up in actors and actresses and automatically give a film 5 stars.

2767789,1,B000NE4SMO,"While I give it 5 stars for all the usual work--acting, cinematography, CGI, art, etc.--I give it one star for the worst sin of all:  IT""S BORING.  The intentional slowness, probably meant to make things more Realistic, just drives us crazy, wanting to know what the H is going on and why does this movie seem to be borrowing from a lot of other sci-fi movies.  To avoid such comparison, I will not list them.  BUT I did have an Epiphany, maybe brought on by the movie's use of a Mormon church at the start.  Could some church wisdom be at work in the overall plot?  I searched and found something interesting.  May I quote THE GATES OF THE NECRONOMICON by Simon?  SPOILER ALERT?  ""I. There is a world we see, and a world we don't see.  II.  Actions that take place in the world we see can influence circumstances in the world we don't see.  Magic is an example of this.  III.  Actions that take place in the world we don't see influence circumstances in the world we see.  Astrology and some religions are examples of this.""  That was from page 9 of the paperback edition.  Now this does NOT mean The Mormon Church has anything to do with the movie, but it does appear in the movie, and the various members who are interviewed all fit a certain profile, familiar to everyone, namely hair style, dress style, and calm and collected demeanor.  That the Necronomicon is an occult text ""of forbidden knowledge of the dark unknown"" may just be a coincidence, it still is remarkable that ""the Mad Arab's original work"" MIGHT have influenced the writer on this movie.  Maybe one star will still make you want to see it and decide for yourself?  One thing is certain, the architecture of a parallel-world is beautiful, in this weird road-picture view.",1471564800,,1744,4.528846153846154
2767790,5,B000NE4SMO,"Outstanding movie, and underrated gem!  The acting and craftsmanship involved is terrific.  Joel Edgerton, Michael Shannon, and the actor who plays the young boy all get very high marks (bravo).  Jeff Nichols has a keen way of presenting a story with a ""less is more"" approach by underplaying his directing and giving just enough information for the viewer to ponder and sum up character interactions, motivations, and backstory.

The movie, on its surface, is focused around a boy with a special gift.  But the story is actually about the viewpoint of a parent - mainly the father played by Michael Shannon.  Once the viewer ""gets"" this (very important) aspect, the movie takes on a much more profound emotional meaning.  Some people report a level of disappointment, which I can imagine is mostly due to an action-jaded audience expecting something like X-Men.  This is not that kind of story, as the sci-fi element takes a ""backseat"" to the heartfelt story of how it feels to be a parent coping with trying to understand what is wrong with his child, and what it might feel like to be willing to risk it all to ensure the boy's safety and well-being.

Much of the movie is intentionally withheld from the viewer to heighten the mystery.  In fact, the story starts smack in the middle of a chase that's already underway... so the sense of urgency is already in your face right at the beginning.  Once the movie ends, the viewer is left with many unanswered questions (which is fully intentional and not ""plot holes"").  In my opinion, any extra time spent to answer some of these questions would be a disservice to the film as it would take away the focus from the father (the actual protagonist of the film) to the boy possessing a unique gift.  Jeff Nichols is a director with great talent, and ranks right along side the current favorite filmmakers of today's generation (such as Christopher Nolan and Denis Villeneuve).",1471564800,2,1924,4.77643504531722

2767842,4,B000NE4SMO,"An unusual Sci-Fi offering from writer and director Jeff Nichols who actually brought one or two
other movies i've enjoyed to the screen such as 'Mud' and 'Take Shelter' (the latter also starred
'Micheal Shannon' (Have not seen 'Shotgun')
The film tells of 'Roy' (Micheal Shannon) with his biological son 'Alton' (Jaeden Lieberer) escaping
the clutches of a religious cult after it was discovered young 'Alton' had special-powers.
'Roy' is helped by friend and former military man 'Lucas' (Joel Edgerton)
'Roy' has been reported by the cult as a child-abductor and will be pursued by the authorities as
well as members of the cult who want the gifted child back in their mist.
The F.B.I had become interested in the 8 year-old after being told of his powers by members f the
cult who they had interviewed.
'Roy's' wife 'Sarah' (Kirsten Dunst) joins the attempt to keep 'Alton' safe, realising they must try to help
him return to where he truly belongs.
When at a Hotel the boy is snatched by cult members all seems lost....however the authorities intercept
the trackers and take 'Alton' to a Government Facility to investigate the claims, fortunately agent 'Paul
Sevier' (Adam Driver) having witnessed 'Alton's' unusual powers realises the boy should be reunited wit
his parents.
With road-blocks, military personnel and Helicopters in pursuit 'Roy' knows they must risk-all to give
'Alton' the chance to escape.
With glimpses into 'Alton's' real World the film has many tense moments along the way during the pursuit
which see's 'Roy' and 'Lucas' having to use their firearms.
Not sure that comparisons with films with a similar theme such as 'Starrman' and 'Close Encounters' should
be made, though i have to say the film is worthy of a viewing.

2767844,5,B000NE4SMO,"Just finished watching ""Midnight Special"" released by Warner Brothers.
Written and directed by Jeff Nichols, ""Midnight Special"" reminded me of several novels written by the late Alexander Key:  ""Escape To Witch Mountain,"" ""The Forgotten Door,"" and ""The Case of the Vanishing Boy.""  Religion and other-worldliness factored heavily into Key's novels; and in ""Escape To Witch Mountain,"" it's a disillusioned priest who helps Tony and Tia find their way back to their otherworldly family, not a disgruntled old man.
In ""Midnight Special,"" Alton, a dying young boy with a gift of prophecy, is kidnapped by his father from the religious cult that has custody of him after his parents escaped.
Both the cult and the government want Alton for their own purposes.  The religious cult believes he is a messiah who will bring about the end-of-times and should be sacrificed to bring about the end of the world.
The government of course wants Alton for their own purposes.
What transpires is an intense road chase as Alton's reunited parents, and a friend of theirs, rush to get Alton to a location where he can ascend into the reality that he belongs to.  And it's heartbreaking because Alton's parents know that they can not follow their son to where he is going and where he belongs; and they are willing to live the consequences of their actions if it saves Alton.
A very intense and absorbing movie.

This is a great, well-done and entertaining film that is well-made and interestingly different. Jeff Nichols has made another impressive film to his resume. It is also a great follow-up to his previous movie, ""Mud"". Michael Shannon is solid as usual as Roy (in his fourth movie with Nichols), as are Joel Edgerton, Kirsten Dunst, Adam Driver, Jaeden Lieberher & Sam Shepard (in his second movie with Nichols).

I felt like it starts in the middle of a story and you have to fill in the blanks to the who's doing what part in the movie.  By the end, you have an idea but I still feel like I need to watch it again.  I'm still confused why/how the government knew to look for the child in the beginning of the film, as he wasn't reported kid napped.  Stuff like that.

2767871,5,B000NE4SMO,"Its very rare for a film to sustain an engaging mystery throughout its duration, and rarer still to successfully cap the experience with an exciting and inspiring climax. While 10 Cloverfield Lane was generally lauded this year for being the big Twilight Zone event in cinema, that piece of fluff is beginners 101 compared to the magnificent strangeness and beautiful depth of this film. The major difference between the two films - or even what separates the basic from the best  is that the weaker story emphasizes only the grand solution, the big finale which finally answers the big question. But the better films are enjoyable throughout by including a myriad of intriguing details and subplots beyond the grand mystery. This film Midnight Special definitely belongs with the superior sci-fi suspense by having superb production, terrific acting, and a deep plot that goes far beyond just what happens at the end.

One factor that might have prevented potential viewers of the film is the child. This film is not for children, certainly not younger viewers at least, and the boy in the movie is much more of a piece of the story and hardly the focus. Teenagers could enjoy the film, younger kids might be confused and/or scared. The father is the true protagonist here, and the film is definitely crafted with adult sensibilities and intensity.

The film could disappoint the crowd that demands answers for everything, but besides the amazing puzzle of the plot, few films can combine such fantastic fare and heady ideas with numerous moments of touching beauty and gripping adventure. The various facets of wonder are a testament to the skillful design of the picture which can successfully marry a high-stakes fate-of-the-world plot with a small portrait of family, trust and love.",1469750400,,1788,5.033783783783784

2767916,3,B000NE4SMO,"Midnight Special has a really solid cast, including Michael Shannon, Kirsten Dunst and Sam Shepard (among others) that give good performances in their roles.  Those solid acting performances are really what makes the movie watchable as the slow moving story and buildup to the disappointing ending makes this more of an average movie instead of a great one.

The story does a great job at building the suspense and tension but it really takes too long to get there.  I was expecting a grand finale that would make me say oh wow but instead had me saying Meh.  There are too many long scenes with meaningless dialogue that really do little to add to the intrigue of the movie.  The story does a pretty poor job at explaining the background of the characters and doesnt really satisfy many of the questions that the story creates.  It really fails to explain much about the kid with the mysterious powers at all other than the simple explanation at the end which really ends pretty predictably and really doesnt satisfy.

The movie tries hard to be like a Close Encounters type movie or others in this genre and it has its moments, but unfortunately lacks a bit with its execution and overall story.  It had a lot of potential to be a great mysterious type of sci-fi movie but doesnt deliver on the payoff like it should.

It is an ok watch for a movie rental night but falls short of being a great memorable one.

The setup was excellent but the story simply got lazy...instead of growing a concept by explaining details about why this all was happening and why we should care, this script took the easy way out and simply ended with a bunch of senseless fluff, overlaid it with grand music and visuals, and called it a day. Here's a tip, screenwriter and director: just because your actors have profound looks on their faces doesn't mean that the plot is profound; it means, in this case, that you substituted true profundity for the fake kind. I truly have no idea what really happened in this movie, and therefore don't care about the events, or their ""conclusion"" at all. Not one bit.

Or you could watch 6 seasons of Lost and get to the same place Midnight Special brings you in 90 minutes. Sure, Midnight Special fails the audience in the same way JJ did, but at least Lost had compelling pacing for each of its episodes ... and it felt like it was answering questions along the way. Jeff Nichols gets the atmosphere right, but that's not the difficult part. Midnight Special breaks the compact with the audience. Giant celestial mystery? Crazy Number theories? Secret government agents, trying to figure it out. Totally my wheelhouse. Sadly, the wheels came off.

Just an opinion, but iIf a filmmaker substitutes mystery for character development, perhaps they should make an effort to deliver on it.  Instead, we got some pan shots that could have been in Brad Bird's Tomorrowland. Credit roll.

It wasn't very thrilling and wasn't very entertaining or fun to watch for most parts. It was still a simple rich story that was not epic or trying to be. I have no idea where this story comes from or if it has a background that we should know about. But over all the actors were great even if the material was a little peculiar or odd. The resolution or final act was worth it. The mystery gets somewhat solved. The creativity in the final scenes or set was inspiring.,1468540800,,564,4.330188679245283

2768017,3,B000NE4SMO,"A film I really thought I would like being Jeff Nichols made it and the stellar cast including Michael Shannon, Joel Edgerton, and Adam Driver, but the film is a bit of a dud. Driver and the child who's name escapes me at the moment are the best things about the film but there is not much plot as one would expect and everything else is sort of thrown together. Yes, any idiot could see the film is about a kid with special powers that the government/other powerful individuals want, but it's execution leaves a lot to be desired. I was hoping there would be more character development to go with such a plot as it just starts already deep into the story. Sometimes the latter is good but here we are left with a bit of a mess that sadly can put one to sleep then wake up and literally have missed absolutely nothing. It's unfortunate because of the great cast that is mainly wasted. Nichols' other film ""Loving"" may be the more complete film out of the two offerings he has this year. Go back and watch the excellent ""Mud"" or the Shannon acting showcase ""Take Shelter"" for a better understanding of this great filmmaker, as Midnight Special is not it.",1468368000,,1153,4.417840375586854

2768021,3,B000NE4SMO,"What really could have and should have been a MUCH better movie lacked, drive, depth and overall excitement. Midnight Special had the opportunity to be something that cinema today desperately NEEDS, a quality, magical, thrilling, adventurous film that can be enjoyed by all. Instead it fell in the the obvious pitfalls that plague many, if not most, indie movies.

When the movie should have been picking up the pace, it was slowing it down, where there should have had more of a sense of wonder there were only questions and when it was all over everything was the same. These are all things that are the complete opposite of what is exhibited in a REAL masterpiece like Steven Spielberg's E.T. (the films most obvious imitation).

Aside from all the unnecessarily long dramatic pauses and cuts back and forth and back and forth between characters, there was a disturbing lack of a consistent musical presence. Again, going back to E.T., the music in the film is almost constant. I'm not comparing John Williams and David Wingo (or anybody else for that matter) but it felt like the music only showed up when it was deemed mandatory. But thats just not what kind of a movie this was apparently. It was an indie movie, disguised as a sci-fi adventure film that really just ended up where it began.

It's not a bad movie, but if it sounds like I'm frustrated thats because I am. I had reasonably high hopes for this movie and I was disappointed at how much I was let down. There's a reason the film lost almost $12M of its $18M budget at the box office. If director Jeff Nichols is ever going to try to do another Spielberg impression, he's gonna need to try a lot harder. In recent memory the best I have seen is JJ Abrams' ""Super 8"".",1468195200,,1734,4.551282051282051

2768058,5,B000NE4SMO,"A moving, thoughtful science fiction drama with paranormal overtones--if that makes any sense.  This is a touching, mysterious movie which really pays off in the end.  In a thought-provoking way.

The pacing is slow, but the tension is high.  If you've ever wondered about parallel dimensions, occult levels of reality, angels, etc. then I suggest you give this movie a try.

Yes, it sparks as many questions as it answers, but the story is beautiful in its own weird way.  Can a father's love prevail?  Can the bonds of friendship bring about victory?  Can a boy this ""special"" really be protected from the government and a religious cult?

And what does one do when a boy is born who does not belong on Earth--this Earth?

The acting is impeccable.  So, you will be drawn into these characters' lives right away.

Most of the characters are uninteresting save for Alton the messianic youngster played by Jaeden Lieberher who previously shined in ""Saint Vincent"" and the little seen ""The Confirmation"".

2768108,2,B000NE4SMO,"The movie seriously lacked any kind of sci-fi premise, as if to say you've seen enough of these movies, it's a kid with special powers so the FBI is after him, got it?  And what kind of powers? Well, we're never really sure.  He seems to be pretty omniscient and pretty-near omnipotent.  He should have just used those superpowers to avoid the car chase scenes.  His eyes light up; is that good? bad?  They seem to be both blinding death-rays and something you want to look into to become enlightened.  In the 1964 movie Children of the Dammed when the kids' eyes lit up it was time to run. That was a movie that knew what it was about.  This one is a hodgepodge of character stereotypes and plot cul-de-sacs.  There's a cult leader whose sermons consist of numbers and that gets the attention of the FBI because the numbers are super top secret. He explains it by telling them that he speaks in tongues  Hmm, maybe the movie is about that- no, back to the kid on the run.  There's a scene toward the end when the Kristen Dunst character says to her special son I understand.  That's nice because the viewer can't understand anything  -because there's nothing to understand.  -just spooky music and lights and translucent aliens from another dimension. yawn.",1467417600,,1258,4.5874439461883405

That said, the reviewer that mentioned the lack of a plot payoff at the end makes a good point.  While the movie was good, one is left wondering how did it all come to be and what is the point of it all.  While I like it when Hollywood doesn't feel the need to pander to the idiots  by spelling it all out, there should be a hint and this movies missed that leaving deep performances from the actors in the shallows.

At the same time it could be much, much worse (pretentious), like Interstellar.  Shannon is more believable than McConaughey any day and I must tip my hat to Edgarton...never heard of the dude before, but he nailed it.",1467417600,,799,4.315436241610739

2768114,5,B000NE4SMO,"I'm not sure what's happening to movies these days. A lot of them don't even try to bring something to the table. I get the distinct feeling that as soon as I've bought my ticket, Hollywood's job is done. Instantly, I'm whisked away to the Land of No Creativity, a place I've been many times before.

Such is not the case with Midnight Special. Being a millennial, I grew up with ""A.I.: Artificial Intelligence,"" ""Bicentennial Man,"" ""E.T.,"" and the original ""Independence Day."" These were wide ranging sci-fi movies that expanded my young mind.

Midnight Special takes a piece from all of them, especially ""E.T."", as well as a piece from the Battlestar: Galactica reboot, and weaves yet another answer into the fabric of the cosmos - or at least how we imagine it.

Don't worry if you're getting confused halfway into it. That means you're registering it correctly. There's no incredibly dense thematic content to pry open, nor a plot to unravel. Everything will make sense as you approach the end. Don't worry about that.

As the characters do, you have to trust the journey. Once you do, you'll feel things that make you question your life, your choices, and your world. This is the way movies were for me, especially as an 8 year old kid. Can you imagine never having been to a movie before, and getting to see something as expansive as ""Men In Black"" in the 1990's? It blew my mind! I couldn't believe how cool looking and imaginative and fantastic it was!

This evokes a sense of wonder not in the outer reaches, but in the inner reaches. What can I do today? Who can I trust? What's real, and what isn't?

If you go to the theaters expecting an experience, see this. If you go expecting to be entertained, see this. It's great from start to finish. You won't be bored, you won't lack energy, and you won't lack visuals. It'll probably leave you with a sense of awe. It's just one of those, again. I've been waiting a long time.",1467158400,,1933,4.556195965417867

2768116,3,B000NE4SMO,"I love the Sci Fi genre and eagerly anticipated watching this movie on Blu Ray after I missed it in the theater. To be honest, I was pretty disappointed.

The acting, for the most part, is top notch, with Joel Edgerton (Lucas), as the conflicted but loyal sidekick to Michael Shannon (Roy) being the standout in my opinion.

The story however was somewhat lacking. I'll stay away from spoilers but the plot revolves around Alton (played by Jaeden Lieberher), a boy with apparent special abilities. He is ""abducted"" by his birth father, Roy and Roy's high school friend, Lucas, from a religious compound run by Calvin Meyer (Sam Shephard). The cult run by Calvin believes that Alton's special abilities are messages from God and could be foretelling the end of the world (with the belief that Alton will protect the cult members as long as he is with them). With Alton on the run, the cult and the Government (who have also been alerted to Alton's abilities), are in hot pursuit to capture him. The story builds suspense as the viewer is intrigued by what exactly Alton's powers are. The long pursuit has some decent moments but I felt like it dragged too long.  I was also disappointed with the periodic moments where Alton couldn't control his powers; without any real explanation of why and to be honest, pretty vague displays of what his powers actually were.  The story also had a lot of moments of, what felt like, forced foreboding.

I won't give away anything more. The story kind of reminds me of a M. Knight Shamalan movie, where a lot of the pay off to the movie is the ""reveal"" at the end. I also think Starman was actually a better version of this type of story. And to be honest, even Powder, had the viewer more emotionally invested in the ""gifted"" character on the run.

Jeff Nichols appears to be getting a lot of praise for this movie. But, to me, it had a tremendous amount of plot holes and one story line basically ends with no real payoff or explanation. Adam Driver, who is very good, is terribly underutilized as well.

2768123,4,B000NE4SMO,"""Midnight Special"" borrows from a variety of other science fiction film and does so shamelessly. That's not a bad thing in this case as director/writer Jeff Nichols takes a number of familiar character types and situations used in films like ""Starman"" (among others) turning ""Midnight Special"" into an entertaining film largely on the strength of his performers Michael Shannon, Joel Edgerton, Kristen Dunst and the marvelous Jaeden Lieberher.

SPOILERS:

Roy (Shannon) and Lucas (Edgerton) escort Roy's son Alton (Lieberher) to an unspecified location. The boy has special gifts which make him the focus of capture by the FBI and the leader of a religions cult (Sam Shepherd in what amounts to a cameo). . Along the way these gifts suggest that Alton isn't entirely human. The trio evade the team led by FBI agent Miller (Paul Sparks) and NSA specialist Seiver (Adam Driver).

END OF SPOILERS:

Produced on a small budget, the film provides a number of impressive visual effects driven set pieces but all of these are in service of both character and the plot. While Nichols' premise may not be all that original, he brings a flavor to the film that makes it stand out--it feels both like an Indie film AND a mainstream science fiction film at the same time. The set up is, as with all of Nichols films, terrific but I felt that the conclusion was a bit of a let down (it's difficult given the suspenseful build up to come up with something that would measure up to the terrific performances and direction).

The Blu-ray looks extremely good with a nice looking transfer. If you're watching this via Amazon on demand video or DVD keep in mind that the darker sequences might not resolve themselves quite as well as the Blu-ray.

The audio provides a terrific surround experience even when the scenes are primarily dialog driven.

The special features are meager. ""Origins"" runs about 13 minutes and provides us with character provides profiles of the main characters. ""The Unseen World"" provides an explanation for one of the key concepts of the film that Nichols introduces. I wouldn't watch either of these prior to watching the film.

I would have been interested in a commentary track from Nichols, Shannon and Edgerton rather than the two featurettes included and suspect that both are probably pulled from the website material for the film when it was released theatrically back in March.

Although Nichols ""Midnight Special"" isn't particularly original conceptually, Nichols' skillful execution and the performances of the actors in the film ""sell"" the film to the audience. It's entertaining if not quite as enigmatic as Nichols other films ""Mud"" and ""Take Shelter"",",1467158400,,2675,4.9932584269662925

Loved the movie and the edge of your seat suspense it provided at times. I barely recognized Ms Dunst but it is quite apparent that she has certainly grown as an actress. There was not a glitch to be found in this movie as far as Im concerned other than the fact that it ended too soon for me.

2768127,3,B000NE4SMO,"I did enjoy watching it a bit but let me tell you the basics:
The movie had HUGE potential. The subject was very creative and entertaining but they did not do much with it. The entire movie is more like a teaser of something that should be expanded, as explained by other reviewers.
This movie is basically about a kid who is born with a strange ""ability"". He has ability to tap into everything that uses light/electricity, he is connected to another world and throughout the move he discovers more and understands where he belongs. The kid is being valued by different groups as a messenger and a lot of things...
The problem with the movie is that they never get into the why or the purpose of anything. Its like... yep the kid is this or that and the end is like a fact, no real apparent purpose. They do give some clues of some things that could be built on but its just like.. the movie never gets to the bottom line or the purpose or reason.",1467072000,,947,4.29608938547486

I kept waiting for it to get more interesting, but it never did. I thought the performances were excellent, given the weak directing. And the sound was way too quiet, even with the volume on high, which made the overuse of the pumping heavy pulse of the base shake the tv almost off the wall. Too many scenes we'd all look at each other & say - what did he say? 'Dunno, couldn't hear it'  I used to believe Rotten Tomatoes reviews, but not anymore. There's no way this movie got 89% & makes me think RTomatoes might be getting back ganders from film companies to write dishonest favorable reviews.

So much was unexplained (and not in a good, thought provoking way), the 'reveals' were either immediately stated or anti-climatic, and the dialogue was forced. People's motives seemed pretty contrived---actions were made to move along the plot, and weren't decisions I could see the characters actually making (why is everyone walking so slowly?). At almost two hours long, it's amazing how little information was conveyed. It really could have used a stronger editor, one who insisted less time be given to long looks toward the horizon and more to the people thinking and figuring out the 'mystery' and actual meaningful dialogue between the characters.",1466812800,,789,5.2204724409448815

2768202,1,B000NE4SMO,"Many echoes of Close Encounters here (and Jaws with Lucas' childlike last line), and many, many other borrowed movie tropes. It begins well, making it very clear that there are secrets to discover, and it's disciplined and strong about not telling them to you. But that only works if in the end you have something to say, and this movie doesn't. Also, it was incredibly ill-advised (and callow) to actually show those visual effects at the end (no spoiler). That should have been done, with maturity and courage, by simply showing the reactions of observers. You don't show ""the monster"" if it's obviously a man in a suit, and these visuals were utterly dreadfully designed, and should not have been shown. There were also some facepalmingly stupid scenes and lines that it's an insult to be expected to swallow. They're both shot down, tied up, and later apparently perfectly fine. And, what Paul says on handing over the boy is utterly moronic in light of what just happened to him. For a moment, with ""I can help"", it looks like at least the writer is paying attention but then, no, he doesn't help in the slightest, so that's another WTF? One star for starting out well and having a nicely written escape scene, but that's about all there is here and that's far, far, far from a movie.

2768232,3,B000NE4SMO,"I rented this film based upon its five star reviews.  I was really disappointed.  The plot really lacks development. For example, the movie begins with the boy and his father already on the run from the authorities.  It is very unclear as to how the authorities found out about the boy and/or what they want to do with him. Additionally, no explanation is given as to how a boy with such extraordinary powers was conceived by two simple humans.",1466553600,,444,4.594936708860759
2768233,4,B000NE4SMO,"Midnight Special is about the relationship between gifted child Alton (Jaeden Lieberher) and his father, Roy (Michael Shannon). As the film opens, father and son, along with friend Lucas (Joel Edgerton), are racing through the night. We find out they are fleeing from religious extremists and local law enforcement. Alton has supernatural powers that enable him to hack into encrypted government data, manipulate all forms of technology, and shoot light beams from his eyes that impart wisdom on their target. The boy must be at an unspecified location in four days and dad is dedicated to make that happen, even though the search for Alton has rapidly escalated to a nationwide manhunt involving the highest levels of the Federal Government.

Though the movie is rooted in a science-fiction premise, it is mostly about the extent to which a parent will go to protect his child. We empathize with the plight of father and son as they attempt to hide from the clutches of those who want to exploit Altons abilities. The establishment is clearly the villain here, with authority figures as evil antagonists.

Filled with a sense of paranoia, Midnight Special is reminiscent of Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Though the latter deals with an alien invasion, it tells of the clever way outer-space visitors intend to conquer earth  one person at a time, by replacing human beings with aliens that use human bodies as shells.

Shannon, whose face usually suggests intimidation or authority, takes on a different kind of role as a concerned, loving father. Kirsten Dunst co-stars as Altons mother and Adam Driver plays an NSA agent. Young Mr. Lieberher plays Alton as a regular kid dealing with his powers in a remarkably mature manner.

Bonus extras on the widescreen Blu-ray release include character profiles and The Unseen World, a featurette in which director Jeff Nichols discusses the films premise.",1466467200,,1900,5.076923076923077

""Midnight Special"" is very difficult to critique specifically without spoilers, so I'll just say that this is a good ""thinking"" movie, very well-acted,  that takes on very big ideas from novel POVs, and in general, it works, but doesn't blow you away. It is reminiscent of ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"", but where ""CEofTK"" gained warmth by being centered on a very relatable average guy, this is centered on a very unrelatable child, which keeps the audience a bit at arm's length. Michael Shannon and especially Joel Edgerton do their best to heat up the humanity... it's just not quite enough to pull me all the way in. Also, and even more important, the climax of ""Midnight Special"" is intellectually quite cool, makes you go ""wow"", but doesn't get INTO you the way ""Close Encounters"" did. I know it's not quite fair to compare this to such a classic, but writer/director Jeff Nichols has shot that high here, and considering he hit a home run with ""Mud"" and knocked the ball completely out of the park with ""Take Shelter""... he rates comparison to Spielberg. I was excited to see ""Midnight Special"", and I will be just as excited to see what he comes out with next. This is a good movie. Just, not a great one.",1466294400,,1248,4.621621621621622

There's no likable characters. You can't even get to know them. It's two hours long and about one hour and 45 minuets of it are people staring at each other. The kid is vaguely mysterious. That's the only way to describe any of them. I'd dare anyone to prove me wrong on that.

One thing they did really well was building tension, but that's it. The tension gets built and then it's deflated.

2768269,4,B000NE4SMO,"Well, this movie is kind of a mixed bag for me but one thing I can say is the director is some kind of a phenomenon now and you shouldn't miss his movies as a trend. And this movie is one of the most original Sci-fi movie that I have to admit although it is not my cup of tea.

I didn' t knew Michael Shannon or Jeff Nichols, the director although I had his movies <MUD> and <TAKE SHELTER>. For some reason, my hands just didn't reached his movies somehow. There's no reason to make me want to watch his movies so far.
But this movie was kind of diffrent.
The film is about a boy who has a supernatural power and now is raised by this guy and a woman and now is running away from CIA, NASA, and some other people who are naturally some kind of cult group of people who think that the boy is some kind of a massia for this world.

The boy can see things that others cannot see, he can make things beleiveable, he can use his eyes to shoot some kind of a ray as a weappon, trace secret code from government and so on.
He is actually from another plannet. He is an alien who looks exactly like us.

But his carer, the mother and the father truely love him and we can see that.
The father and his chidhood friend are running away with the boy to protect him from a bunch of guys but finally beind caught from the government.
Also the cult religious guys are trying to kill them too but they barely survived.

The story is kind of offbeat I know but the acting of Michael Shannon the father and Kirsten Dunst the mother and also the father's friend acted by Joel Edgerton plus the supernatural kid starred by Jaeden Lieberher made it all worked out.
You will believe as time goes by and begin to support the boy running away from all that people.

Along with them is the government guy Adam Driver who ends up with letting the boy go. He did a pinnacle job from the story.
He looked like a good person after all.

All in all, mosly all the actors are amazing.

And plus although the movie is super low budget, the special effect is really good and has a lot of things to watch such as there is this image of the futuristic city like look we see overlapped with our world for awhile which is some kind of sign maybe to show the image of the place where the boy came from. That was very enchanting to look at.

As seeing this film makes me want to watch his other films without hesitation.

It is the story of a couple, along with a loyal friend, and their effort to keep their son safe from a cult and the USA government
(funny that they are after the same thing). The reason is that the son has some weird uncontrollable power. The movie
is that chase and the effort to reach a particular destination. And although there are some action scenes necessary to
empower the chase, this movie is at times sweet (love of a father) and violent (although nothing on the fully automatic side).

It is a story with an unexpected end, one that you might think is coming by the middle of the movie (yes Close Encounters does come to
mind), but which is surprisingly interesting.
Great choice of cast. This Michael Shannon guy is the perfect man of no facial expressions. Remember to check that when in the movie
he says that he is scared.

2768277,5,B000NE4SMO,"2nd viewing has changed my opinion.  Upping this another star.  Here's the original review:

""Paid for it.  You should rent.  Very many 30 second scenes where all we see is someone thinking and very very sleight facial moves.  They're thinking hard etc., but it's boring....even though well acted.  Film ends with a resolution that's a yet still bigger mystery.  Lots of questions left unanswered.  Ending hints at a possible TV series, but this film just doesn't deliver enough punch per minute.  Can't see the series getting made.  The trailer's promises were kept, but it's a long sit to get to the end.  Three stars' worth of entertainment, four stars for production budget and pretty pictures.  Two stars for plot clarity and conclusions.  Disappointed in the CGI -- they didn't flesh out the 'others.'""

2nd viewing review:  Don't pay any attention to that wussy gotta-have-it-his-way roadkill-for-brains daft twit.  Everything he cited was at least two notches less approving than it should have been.  BAH! on the old me, BAH!

Every gripe above, yeah so what?  It's an artwork, and needs must we allow for creativity's indulging in amateurism when budgets this low are the major constraints.  I was way too critical in my 1st viewing -- so much so that major dynamics of the story went right over my head.  Sigh...this is not easily admitted by the likes of me!

Buy this.  Proudly add it to your SciFi collection.  Old title to my 1st review was:  ""Slow and moody and scant payoff but still watchable.""",1465257600,12,1512,4.854330708661418
2768278,5,B000NE4SMO,"Take Shelter director Jeff Nichols film is a science fiction/chase thriller that evokes John Carpenters Starman yet, is very much its own movie. Alton (Jaeden Lieberher) is a boy with some very unique and unexplainable powers. These powers have earned him a religious cult built around him that believes he can protect them from the coming Judgment Day. As he can receive communications of even the most top secret kind, the government is very interested in him as well. His father Roy (Michael Shannon) and friend Lucas (Joel Edgerton) kidnap Alton from the cult and now flee across country to a place and time the boy insists he must be. With both government agents and cultists in hot pursuit, will they get there in timeor at all?

If you can imagine John Carpenter at his prime teaming with Steven Spielberg in his earlier years than this flick is what you might have gotten. Nichols writes and directs a tale of a mysterious and special boy on the run from those who seek to use his gifts for their own purposes. What makes this work especially well is the emotional depth its given being presented from the perspective of a loving father accepting his son for who he is and willing to give his life to see him safe. Its this emotional core that makes this work beyond the well-executed SPFX sequences of Altons powers at workwhich are used sparingly, but to full effect. There is certainly suspense and some tense sequences, which are all deftly handled, but it is the films sense of wonder and the flesh and blood characters that really draw us in. Even if the Spielbergian finale is a bit more on a Disney level than the more intense and sometimes violent rest of the film, it still works and leaves us effected even after the credits role, as Nichols doesnt just present it, but shows us some of the effects on those around it. It gives the SPFX filled moment weightand a sense of wonder. The director/writer takes a familiar tale and really makes it something fresh and fills it with some very three dimensional characters which give it a realism and keeps it grounded, despite the science fiction elements. Its a really enjoyable film with a heart, as well as, SPFX, action and suspense. There is an effective score by David Wingo and some Dean Cundey-esque cinematography from Adam Stone to add to an already exceptional movie.

The cast couldn't be better. Michael Shannon again proves he is one of the most gifted actors around as Altons caring and self-sacrificing father, Roy. Jaeden Lieberher is enchanting as Alton, who is more than he seems and we really endear to him despite his sometimes dangerous abilities. Joel Edgerton, fresh off The Gift, is again solid as the state trooper who is willing to break the laws he holds dear to help his friend and his son. We also have Kirsten Dunst in a touching role as Altons mother who loves him enough to possibly let him go, if it means his safety. Sam Shepard also appears as cult leader, Calvin Meyer and rounding out the leads is Adam Driver as a sympathetic government official who decides to help Alton find what it is he is looking for. A top notch cast that make their characters very real.

A emotionally strong and highly enjoyable thriller about a special boy and the race to keep him safe. Alton is a bit of a mystery at first, but as we journey with him, we slowly learn just how fantastically special he is. The film has a big heart with some tense action and suspense, along with a sense of wonder and some very effective SPFX moments. But unlike the CGI laden big budget FX spectacles of today, this film has a very human center at its core, about a parents love for their child and the lengths they will go to see them safe. Great movie that reminded me of John Carpenter in his prime and the earlier works  of Steven Spielberg. Highly recommended.",1465084800,16,3829,4.5854014598540145
2768279,5,B000NE4SMO,"Highly enjoyable, character-driven Science Fiction. Jeff Nichols is making a serious claim to the title of Next Great American Director, between this and the likes of Mud, and the excellent Take Shelter. Whilst Midnight Special is certainly the kind of movie which leaves the audience to fill in some of their own gaps, if you're happy to engage, you'll get more from your two hours investment than you put in.

While the resolution, as I mentioned, requires a leap of imagination, the journey is compelling throughout, and excellently carried by the cast which includes the ever-reliable Michael Shannon in one of his more interesting roles. The special effects are employed with a deft, sparing touch, such that they complement the storytelling rather than distracting from it (as they did in the awful Batman Versus Superman). Nichols knows exactly when CGI is necessary, and when to ease off the pump.

 Midnight Special is soulful Sci-Fi, equal parts tender, and full of a grittily-earned wonder: Think ET, meets Close Encounters, meets 10 Cloverfield Lane. Can't wait to watch it again.",1464566400,,1092,5.123595505617978

2768282,4,B000NE4SMO,"The best sci-fi doesn't need to be complicated; a high concept can be explored in deeply intimate, personal terms. Steven Spielberg was the master of this, especially in the '80s when directing all of those movies we loved as kids. He knew how to take the impossible and use it to shine a light on what was right in front of our faces. That skill doesn't come to everybody, but one man who has it in spades is Jeff Nichols, whose latest film ""Midnight Special"" is full of mysteries, secrets, chases, and cults, but when boiled down to its very essence is a remarkable story about a father's love for his son.

Faith and fatherhood have been at the core of Nichols' films post-""Shotgun Stories"", yet he never tackles either directly. The confidence which he weaves numerous other elements and genres is just one reason why he's one of the most fascinating directors working today. ""Midnight Special"" begins looking very different than how it concludes. The lean, muscular setup begins with Roy (Nichols' rocksteady star, Michael Shannon) and his pal Lucas (Joel Edgerton), crammed into a seedy motel with all of the lights out; the windows draped shut. Is it to prevent light from getting in? To deny outsiders visibility into the room? A report on the TV fills us in; they're kidnappers, and the boy they're running away with, 8-year-old Alton (Jaeden Lieberher), is Roy's son. The report stirs something in them; they have to leave RIGHT NOW. Seconds later they're tearing down the road in pitch black night, leaving only the sound of the car's roaring engine.

This is no simple kidnapping. The boy is ""special""; he's got strange powers nobody seems to understand. Roy believes he's meant for a greater purpose that will unfold in a few days' time. But what is it? What is the extent of Alton's abilities? How did he gain them? What does Roy know that we don't? And why is there a secretive cult (led by Sam Shepard) chasing him, as well? Why did the FBI send special agent Sevier (Adam Driver at his dorkiest), who seems to know more than anybody else, in to try and talk to Alton? Nichols doesn't go out of his way to answer anything, letting the mystery unfold in skillful, deliberate strokes. Although this is Nichols' first real studio effort, he isn't trying to fix what has never been broken. His gradual, thoughtful aesthetic is still in place, creating a world so rich in details it stretches beyond the frame. Even as literal meteors begin raining down from the skies, Nichols keeps the story on such a small scale that it could work as either a family drama or blockbuster sci-fi, a tricky combination to pull off for any filmmaker.

But it's in the familial aspects where the film is at its best. Yes, the chase scenes are gripping and the mystery appropriately puzzling, but in the relationship between Roy and Alton we see more than just your typical father/son bond. This is a question of the ultimate faith. Every father wants to believe his son to be unique, because in a way it validates his own life. But what if that were undeniably true? That your son wasn't just special, but something truly unfathomable? As Roy, Shannon is once again charismatic as a father who is unrelenting in the defense of his child. Usually this is a trait we see depicted by women, the ""maternal instinct"" factor that has powered many a thriller. Alton's mother does arrive a bit later in the film, played by Kirsten Dunst, and in her we see years of pent up concerns and worries over the fate of her boy, however this story clearly isn't about her. But perhaps the most intriguing character of all is Lucas, a true believer willing to risk all for his friend. The loyalty and unshakable faith he shows is the film's beating heart, one that is immeasurably large. And let's not forget Lieberher, who gets the unenviable task of playing the film's greatest puzzle. It's a difficult role because it means never revealing too much emotionally one way or another, yet still finding the childlike sensibilities that make us understand who Alton is. Lieberher's well-practiced at this point, having undergone the mentorship of Bill Murray in ""St. Vincent"" and Clive Owen in recent drama ""The Confirmation"" and perhaps what's most amazing is the effortless chemistry he's able to build with his co-stars, which now includes Shannon.

Nichols' story unfolds in such a straight-forward, linear fashion that some elements feel like an unnecessary intrusion. The cult aspect probably didn't need to be there, and while Driver's NSA investigator provides some welcome comic relief and a bit of grounding, the feds' involvement is a diversion that takes us away from the characters we are fully invested in. To Nichols' credit, he's able to take a finale full of flash and spectacle to create something warm and human.

Similar to what he was able to accomplish with ""Take Shelter"", Nichols weaves the common with the uncommon, putting his own spin on the Amblin formula. ""Midnight Special"" is a dark and daring enigma, one that leaves its many mysteries wide open, putting faith in you to sort out the answers.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Midnight-Special-Blu-ray-Digital-HD-Ultraviolet/dp/B01F5ZY4G0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Midnight Special (Blu-ray + Digital HD Ultraviolet)</a>",1463788800,,5318,4.964085297418631
2768283,5,B000NE4SMO,"Jeff Nichols, the writer/director behind two instant American classics Mud and Take Shelter, brings us Midnight Special. The film is a blend of genres and subgenres, being a family drama as well as a chase film, mixed with political and religious conspiracy elements, and being a sci-fi thriller at the core. It juggles them all perfectly by bringing focus to the people of the world instead of the actual situation. Roy Tomlin takes his son Alton (who was adopted by cult leader Calvin Meyer) with Roy's best friend Lucas, as they race to get Alton ""where he needs to be,"" for he is not like us, with the FBI also on the hunt for Alton, and NSA specialist Paul Sevier acting as their consultant.

To reveal anything outside of that would spoil quite a bit of the movie, as well as the effect it has. The film is a slow-burn, having a few action sequences in the form of car chases and one brief shootout (of which was extremely intense, being one-sided), but is mainly a somber thriller about a father who will go to the ends of the earth to keep his son safe. Everything about Midnight Special was brilliant, from the writing and direction to the seamless visuals and outstanding production values, but it was the acting that made the movie so much more. Michael Shannon was the most real father I've seen depicted on screen, fighting tooth & nail for his son's safety, as well as being both strict and soft when he needs to be. Jaeden Lieberher was incredible as Alton, the boy with otherworldly abilities that everyone is fighting over, and his performance was both astounding and heart-breaking, for his powers come with a hefty price. Joel Edgerton was phenomenal as Lucas, the best friend of Roy and a Texas Ranger. He's a man pulled into a conflict he half understands, but fights because he knows the stakes, and those involved. He knows it's for the right reasons, but being a man of the law, he walks a line that Roy tends to cross, with Lucas there as the mediator to bring Roy back from crossing it. Adam Driver as Paul Sevier added intrigue to the movie, as well as humor and heart, as he isn't the stereotypical government agent, but instead a man who simply wants to know about Alton, but not at the behest of ruining lives. Finally, Kirsten Dunst's Sarah Tomlin, the distraught mother who's been watching from the sidelines as another man raised her son, and couldn't do anything to help. That is, until Roy shows up, and her motherly instincts kick into high gear.

This isn't a movie for everyone, that's a fact, because some people don't care for sci-fi, even though it's the most inventive genre. But, this movie is a must-see for anyone who loves film, and those who want something that's both a bit of new and a bit of old, as it isn't a full homage to films like E.T and Close Encounters, but carries similar elements that help to craft this truly brilliant masterpiece that is easily Nichols' third instant classic. I can't wait to see his film  ""Loving"" later this year, but until then, get a taste of different with this sci-fi powerhouse that's the best character study I've seen to date.",1463702400,54,3116,4.580645161290323
2768284,3,B000NE4SMO,"I've admired Jeff Nichols' work since he left UNCSA. His early films presented a unique viewpoint and growing grasp of film technique, but most of all the films deeply involved us with his characters. ""Take Shelter"" and ""Mud"" are mini masterpieces. ""Midnight Special,"" his first studio film, is a stumble, an awkward film queasily reminiscent of Stephen King's ""FIrestarter"" and, of course, Spielberg's ""Close Encounters."" The movie has some nicely done set pieces but essentially it's a long, slow slog to a climax Nichol's can't bring off, where the effects are, to say the least, disappointing. I'm just going to forget this and look forward to Nichol's next release, ""Loving.""",1463702400,2,680,5.1909090909090905
2768285,4,B000NE4SMO,"The U.S. government and a group of religious extremists pursue a man (Michael Shannon) and his son (Jaeden Lieberher), a young boy believed to possess otherworldly powers.

If Firestarter and Starman got together and had a kid, it would be this film. I say this with the utmost reverence to both those films AND this one. There are definitely a lot of elements from those movies in which Midnight Special pulls, yet still manages to engage the viewer and satisfy his or her curiosity in its own original way.

Along with Shannon and Lieberher, the cast is rounded out with fine performances by Sam Shepard, Joel Edgerton and Kirsten Dunst. But it is Adam Driver who is the true stand out. His dry, unintentionally funny portrayal of a well-meaning government scientist is the ice breaker in a very serious film.

Speaking of which, if there are any complaints I have with this picture, then THAT would be one of them. Its soooooo serious most of the time and really could have benefited from more humor other than just Drivers witticisms. My other nitpick is that the pacing is way off. Yes, this film holds your interest but it takes way too long in between one piece of plot exposition to the next. The same goes for each point of action. The beats are simply askew and, like my friend observed as we were leaving the theatre, makes the big budget"" subject matter feel too indie, which is a bit of a hindrance.

But again, thats not to say I didn't enjoy it. Its a great movie! The pros definitely outweigh the cons here, especially within cast, plot and direction. Bravo to Jeff Nichols for continuing to prove his filmmaking chops! Its a unique story wrapped up in classic science fiction. Because of that, its definitely worth seeing at least once.",1463443200,4,1753,4.645161290322581
2768286,4,B000NE4SMO,"May contain some plot/theme spoilers.

Alton (Jaeden Lieberher) Alf would be too obvious, likes to listen to the radio...in his head. He repeats what he hears thus ""speaking in tongues"" which appeals to ""The Ranch"" a Texas cult built upon Alton's spewing including classified information which draws due diligent attention. Roy (Michael Shannon), a member of the group, absconds with his own child (adopted by the pastor) with the aide of a friend Lucas (Joel Edgerton) a policeman who is not a religious person. Mom (Kirsten Dunst)  left the compound 2 years ago.

Seems Alton has places to go, like Frank Lloyd Wright heaven, which appears near Pascagoula Mississippi?

Now how this seemingly alien baby had human parents and had to live in the dark as an infant wasn't discussed in the film. This is a film which attempts to combine religion, spirituality and UFO sightings into one ""real"" explanation, although I liked ""Altergeist"" string theory better.

The story was interesting even if the characters tilted to the stiff side and the dialogue mostly reeked as in the case of most serious sci-fi films where the script writer was too engrossed in the me-so-clever plot as to take a minute to create memorable characters.

2768288,5,B000NE4SMO,"So many horror/thrillers are so lousy that, when one of this caliber comes along, you want to gobble it up with both hands.

Here's the scoop. Roy (Michael Shannon) and his friend Lucas (Joel Edgerton) are on the run with Roy's son Alton. Something's not quite right. They MUST travel by night because of a quirk in Alton's sight. Alton has a bit of a quirk as well, and as things progress it becomes evident this si no ordinary boy, and this is no ordinary custody kidnapping of a boy by his father.

If you liked ""10 Cloverfield Lane,"" you will probably like this equally as well. Both hold their cards close to their chests and play them sparingly and at even intervals. Both also hold their big surprises till the very end. There are some shock moments here which I usually don't like, but they're delivered here in such a way as to not be cheap scares. They add to the whole of the story. The addition of the reluctant FBI agent (Adam Driver) also helps bring the audience along on the ride. I also liked how un-Hollywoodlike this was. No pretty faces, fancy clothes or impressive sets. This all feels like the America most of us see day to day.

Shannon, Edgerton and Kirsten Dunst (as Alton's mom) do great jobs. They help the audience rise to the feeling of how important their quest is. All the production values are spot on with the project. Big enough so you don't see the bones, but not so big as to get away from itself.

He is trying to bring Alton where he wants to go, but must find ways to hide from everyone in order to protect Alton, and his power. This is a very good and very decent family movie. There are parts that may be a little intense for younger kids but nothing too bad. The best way to describe this is a type of human E.T. The movie is essentially one long chase sequence but hold your interest and really keep you wondering and engrossed. The movie is a little bizarre but worth seeing. This is one that I think people will either love or hate, and really one that must be seen to understand what I am trying to say. I did like this enough and do recommend it but isn't really a movie for everyone. Overall, E.T. with a real kid and not an alien. Worth seeing, but must be in the mood for.

2768293,4,B000NE4SMO,"Theatrical review.  Possible spoilers.  Jeff Nichols (Mud) would seem to be one of our best young directors.  This story is reminiscent of The X-Files and even has elements of his own Take Shelter from 2011.  Michael Shannon (also from Take Shelter) is Roy and early on we believe he has kidnapped his son.  Not from the boy's mother, Sarah (Kirsten Dunst, Melancholia) who he would later reconnect with, but from a religious sect he once belonged to.

Sam Shepard (from the aforementioned Mud) is Calvin Meyer, the leader of the religious group, one of those where the women wear long dresses and wear their hair up in a bun.  Eight-year old Alton (Jaeden Lieberher, so good in St. Vincent) may have special powers and must be kept out of daylight.  Even at night he wears swimmers goggles to keep white light from escaping his eyes.  Roy and his high school best friend Lucas (Joel Edgerton, Black Mass) extract young Alton, believing he is in danger and being used by Calvin to protect them from an upcoming apocalypse.

While this part of the plot is spelled out early, we are kept in the dark as to what exactly Alton can and cannot do and how his gifts would be used.  If he indeed has some special power.  The film movies quite slowly during the middle section of the film and ultimately evolves from a mystery to a chase film once Calvin sics a couple of goons to track them down.  Not only is the religious order after the group, but the government has interest as well.  Perhaps Alton is a lethal weapon, don't ya know.  Adam Driver (Star Wars: The Force Awakens) plays Sevier, an agent with the NSA charged with sifting through the various clues to determine where Alton is being taken.

The actors are terrific from top to bottom and is one of those films that had me guessing the whole way.  The mix of theology and science fiction works perfectly, resulting in a surprising conclusion.",1462060800,20,1899,4.58753709198813
2768294,1,B000NE4SMO,"This movie is liked by critics in the same way contemporary art which is naturally revolting becomes something they adore.  There is nothing I hate in a movie-watching experience more than that point where I feel like I am starting to just unhappily sit through the movie instead of engage with it.  That happened to me recently with Batman v. Superman, but this one (Midnight Special) made me more listless.  I can appreciate a certain amount of obscure dialogue thats intentionally written to sound like the characters understand things the audience isn't supposed to yet, but this movie takes that to an extreme.  Its also got some of the most wooden acting Ive ever seen, and Im not exaggerating, coming from Michael Shannon, who plays an escapee from a weird religious cult whos transporting a boy with supernatural powers.  The story really is not very substantial and could be summarized in about 3 sentences, but that would include the spoiler, which I think isn't really much of a spoiler.  The pace of the movie started to get more ponderous, in my impression, rather than building in tension and excitement, and a lot of this is because theres such lame dialogue.  By lame, I am describing the M. Night Shyamalan kind of dialogue which makes every statement a somber proclamation with word choice and inflection that feel extremely unnatural.  Even the boy, who is a really good actor in his earlier movies (St. Vincent and Aloha), was quite boring in this movie, because he does very little except stare, say things with seriousness, react in panic, and occasionally smile.  The movie feels like it sucks all the life out of its own self, because the things that are supposed to generate energy in its story and character relationships are instead the things which suck the life out of it.  Michael Shannons acting got particularly annoying for me to watch as time went on, and Joel Edgerton also, as they both have basically a single mood.  Adam Driver as the government investigator was the most interesting and most human of the characters, in my opinion.  Googles definition of ponderous describes Midnight Special very well:  slow and clumsy because of great weight; dull, laborious, or excessively solemn.",1461974400,6,2223,4.911764705882353

2768327,5,B000NE4SMO,"The Midnight Special was known for live performances at a time when pretty much every other musical performance on television was lip-synched. BUT...this does not mean EVERY performance was live. Many were live, many were live vocals to a backing track (mostly for instruments) and some were out and out fake. If you know that going in, there's nothing to be disappointed about. That was the show. I'll settle for knowing that even the lip-synching was done to the artist's own recordings, and that means they actually COULD sing, unlike today's most capable talent, Auto Tune.",1302912000,2,577,5.020833333333333

Sound quality is not great but not terrible.  The first show is the worst but gets better for the 2nd & 3rd shows.  I still don't understand why they bothered to mix into Dolby 5.1 from mono, as it's center-channel-heavy and kinda ridiculous from a mono source.

Some of this is fluff and not my cup of tea but representative of music of the time.  It seems Burt was trying to emulate Dick Clark or something.

I will say in general, there were likely more songs recorded by each artist for the show but this DVD only cherry-picks one song by each.  Kind of a bummer.

It's pretty cool and rare to get some vintage footage of the Silver Fox (Charlie Rich) do ""Behind Closed Doors"".  A standout.

Dr. Hook is kinda goofy/hokey, but that was their schtick.

Brownsville Station was definitely a product of their time.  They were sorta hard rock, yet kinda jokey/glam at the same time.

Janis Ian was a folkie/songster of her time and puts in a decent performance here.

Not too much video footage of Jimmie Rodgers likely exists so that makes this one rare.  He has a strange left-hand technique on the guitar with his thumb-over.  He must key-tune it to play it like that.

I love New Orleans, so I have a soft spot for Shirley & Lee performing ""Good Times Roll"" here.  They had re-united in the early 70s for awhile, but interesting their careers started more than 20 years before this.

Sam & Dave perform a smoking ""Soul Man"" with Steve Cropper on guitar.  They are sweating a lot when it starts, which leads me to believe they played more songs before it, but as I stated, we get cheated to only one song per artist.

Why won't they provide us with full shows in this series?",1245196800,7,2512,4.541202672605791

2768339,2,B000NE4SMO,"For a general view of the Midnight Special series as a whole, refer to my review for the first 1973 DVD.  Other reviews preceding mine have some good points, too.

Track List:
Sly & The Family Stone (Everybody Is A Star), Curtis Mayfield (Future Shock), Jim Croce (I Got A Name), Wilson Pickett (Get Me Back On Time, Engine #9), Natural Four (Can This Be Real?), The Bee Gees (Lonely Days), Anne Murray (Snowbird), Don McLean (Vincent), The Association (Along Comes Mary), Badfinger (No Matter What), Marty Robbins (Don't Worry), Tammy Wynette & George Jones (We're Gonna Hold On), Tanya Tucker (Blood Red & Goin' Down), Tammy Wynette (Stand By Your Man), Don Gibson (Oh, Lonesome Me)

This DVD is a serious downhill slide from the preceding two 1973 DVDs.  It has a different format than the predecessors, as this one actually has snippets of the hosts, namely Curtis Mayfield, Anne Murray, and Loretta Lynn & Marty Robbins and is divided into 3 parts, more or less, as each of those 3 shows.  The sound is muddy and the video quality poor in some cases.  Once again, why did they bother to mix it into Dolby 5.1?

The first show, hosted by Curtis Mayfield, has it's best moment, the Curtis Mayfield peformance of ""Future Shock"".  It's not as good as ""Superfly"" from the ""More 1973"" DVD, but still isn't bad.  Once again, Jim Croce performs good and died in a plane crash not long later this year after this show.  Sly Stone is obviously f-ed up, as usual, and it appears to be after Larry Graham left the band.  I was not too impressed.  The other peformances, well, guess it depends on your taste.

The second show, hosted by Anne Murray has its high point, a rare TV Badfinger peformance of ""No Matter What"", by the original lineup and it rocks.  Unfortunately, the sound and video quality are awful.  Why?  Unfortunately they are out of tune, too.  R.I.P. Pete Ham and Tom Evans.  The Association is good, but are much better and inspired on the Complete 1967 Monterey Pop Festival outtake performance DVD set.  Now THAT was good, when they still had their original bass player before drugs and criminal behavior short circuited him.

The third show, hosted by Loretta Lynn & Marty Robbins, well, it's just OK.  Tanya Tucker is mighty young, still in her teens here.  I guess even though I do like these country performers, I am personally not a mainstream country music fan (especially Nashville Top 40), so I may be too biased to give a fair review of them.  I will say, though, that at times these performances seem a bit contrived and I'm not convinced they are all truly ""live"".  That would seem to re-enforce my personal view that country music in general was too contrived for its own good during the 1970's.  Look what Willie Nelson had to do.  He left Nashville for good, and fled to Austin, working outside the Nashville scene.  Once the outlaw country movement took hold in Austin, country music in general was redeemed.  That's my 2 cents...

No comedy segments appear on this DVD.",1220832000,13,2998,4.64638783269962

Comedy segments from Ace Trucking Company and Andrew Johnson

Video quality good; sound quality is a bit muddy but acceptable.

The Seals & Crofts performance of ""Diamond Girl"" is great.  Better than on record.

The Steely Dan is the original touring lineup with ""Skunk"" Baxter & Denny Dias and is quite a rarity.  Worth the price of the DVD alone.  The vocalist David Palmer sure needed an orthodontist, though.

Todd Rundgren is looking quite weird here with a face paint job.  I dunno.  Guess you had to be there.

The Hollies performance is a turkey.  It is when they had their Swedish vocalist and just doesn't sound right with his thick accent (which led to his dismissal).

The Curtis Mayfield ""Superfly"" is probably my one of my top 5 performances from the entire MS series so far.  It just is so great, I find myself humming it once in awhile and then have to watch it.  What a loss that he isn't with us anymore.

The Stories ""Brother Louie"" is pretty good but strangely leader of the band keyboardist Michael Brown is not given much camera time, or he's already quit the band.  Attention is mostly on singer Ian Lloyd.

The Eric Weissman peformance of Deliverance is great and also worth the price of the DVD alone.

I recommend anyone wanting to collect this series buy the first 2 volumes of 1973 & 1974, and perhaps ""Million Sellers"".  After that, you're on your own.",1220832000,24,2033,4.633053221288516
