6701671,2,B00O1VR5SY,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

In an attempt to better understand this movie I went online to see what others had said about it. In reading those comments I found it amazing to think that we had watched the same movie. The reviews that praised this film discussed things that I didn't recall ever seeing in the two and a half hours the film lasted. They also derived things from the movie that Im still trying to figure out how they arrived at.

The movie is a biopic of the famous designer Yves Saint Laurent, considered one of the greatest names in fashion design who ever lived. The film covers only a decade of his life beginning in the late sixties and running through the seventies. It doesnt follow a straight pattern here but instead jumps back and forth in time, a film device that works in some cases but for me did nothing but confuse here.

The movie seems less focused on his accomplishments and more about his personal life. While some of his designs are put on display as are sequences that show him drawing new designs, there is little personal feel to those segments. The same cannot be said of the sexual liaisons that Saint Laurent was involved in. But even that is never quite clear. Was his gay lifestyle an open one taking place in the late sixties or was it hidden? I was never quite sure from the film. Behind the scenes, which is where many of those parts of the film take place, there is plenty of nudity and affection on display but never how well it was known when the movie takes place.

The film moves along at a snails pace with numerous scenes that seem to last forever but that deliver nothing in the way of storytelling. One example, one that someone else praised, shows Saint Laurent sitting in a nightclub and watching a model dance to the song I Put a Spell on You by Creedence Clearwater Revival, a song that last 4:31 according to the album notes the song is on. During this time he watches as the model, Loulou, dances. He smiles and eventually walks up to her and tells her to come work for him to which she replies no. This goes back and forth over and over, both of them smiling as they speak. For over 4 minutes. Other than the fact she does go to work for him in the next scene Im still trying to figure out why we spent that time learning next to nothing.

By the end of the film I had learned very little about the man Yves Saint Laurent other than the fact he was gay, drank and did drugs and designed womens clothing. The design part I knew going in, the rest didn't matter to me. As I started writing this column I looked up information about the man online and learned more in ten minutes of reading about him than I learned in the two and a half hours I spent watching this film. In looking into it I see that the film was nominated for numerous awards which again proves my feelings that awards are less about accomplishment and more about politics than theyve ever been.

The film has been released on disc without a dubbed soundtrack so that might be a turn off to some from the start. The subtitles are presented clearly so thats a plus for fans of foreign films. Know going in though that this is one you will have to read to know whats going on.

Im not one to usually warn people away from movies and realize that hard work and effort goes into them by an entire crew of people behind the scenes. That being said the only thing that works here are the technical aspects of the film, the cinematography to start with. The rest is an incredible bore from the acting to the script to the directing. I doubt that the fashion world is full of gunplay and fist fights but a movie that is a biographical depiction of a persons life should at least be interesting. Somehow this film has made the life of Yves Saint Laurent boring and hum drum.",1443484800,3,3819,4.31058495821727
6701672,3,B00O1VR5SY,"I love Gaspard and although the previews suggested a more hedonistic tone to the movie, I was surprised by the understated way YSL's  contribution to fashion was handled.  It was a bit flat with no other real character development, so it was perhaps too much to ask of Gaspard to carry the film on his own.  The nude scene certainly did not disappoint, but even that seemed misplaced.  Overall, it was a good movie afflicted by my higher expectations.",1443484800,,451,4.670886075949367
6701673,5,B00O1VR5SY,"This film was one of two films based on Yves Saint Laurent. I love this film. It's beautiful very well acted and addictive. Gaspard Ulliel who plays Yves Saint Laurent the legendary fashion designer, portrayed Yves in a very believable way. Louis Garrel who plays Jacques was so stunning I watched his parts again in screen selection. Pierre Berge was portrayed very well by Jeremie Renier,his performance was believable. Lea Seydoux was  good same as how Betty was played. The film was a bit shallow in areas mostly where Jacques left. His exit from the movie should've been played out in scene. Also I did not care for Helmet Berger's Yves Saint Laurent. The moment was too long and being a fashion lover/ Yves Saint Laurent obsessed nerd his moments were inaccurate. Helmut made the film seem a little bit long. Less Helmut more Gaspard! Luckily Helmut was only towards the end of the film. Jeremie Renier was an unexpected star in the film. I love this movie and every time I watch it I find something new about it that I love. So gorgeous and we'll acted, I love it and am well pleased with it. Bravo! A must for not only fashionistas ans YSL lovers but movie fanatics in general.",1443398400,,1185,4.589622641509434
6701674,2,B00O1VR5SY,"This movie is a whole mess just like Yves Saint Laurent's personal life. The director wasted the talents of three top name good actors. I do not see how this movie got any nominations but out of pity.

The movie was all over the place. The story line was badly edited and conversations and scenes were often too long. For example, I know the French side only spoke French to their American investor but using a translator in this long scene, repeating word for word of her french boss over his speech--not good. This went on for eternity. There are so many devices in writing to move this scene forward. The issue is this one of few very informative scenes. It explained the business issues. If you never had know anything about his personal and professional life, this movie did not tell it well.

The only reason to see this is to see Gaspard Ulliel beautifully nude. I repeat this movie waste the talents of Ulliel, my favorite Louis Garrel, and Jeremy Renier.

For a better movie explaining YSL, rent: ""Yves Saint-Laurent"". It explains the life with a better time line of events.",1443312000,,1083,4.601036269430052
6701675,4,B00O1VR5SY,"""Saint Laurent"" (2014 release; 150 min.) is another bio-pic on the fashion designer. As the movie opens, it is ""1974"", where we see Yves checking into a hotel in Paris under the name ""Swann"". We see him making a call to presumably a reporter, informing him that he's ready for the interview. The movie then jumps to ""1967"", and the fashion house is in full swing to get its latest collection of ""haute couture"" ready We get to appreciate how Yves goes about as he is working, always with classical music on. At this time we are barely 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, you may remember that last year produced not one, but two YSL bio-pics out of France: there was ""Yves Saint Laurent"", and then there was this. The former is well-intended but wafer-thin, lacking any depth. No such problem with this movie, which takes you into the world of YSL, both the person and the business, and then some. Writer-director Bertrand Bonello has the audacity (and I mean it in the best possible way) of letting scenes develop slowly but with purpose. Check the scene early in the movie (in 1968) where YSL is at a night club. CCR's I Put A Spell On You comes blasting on, and eventually a gorgeous blonde steps onto the dance floor and dances to the music. YSL watches, and watches, and watches, and eventually decides to approach her: ""You need to come work for me, I will design a collection for you"". By then we are almost at the end of CCR's song, which played for minutes on. It is one of the best scenes of the movie, but it certainly is not the only time that Bonello uses this technique. The last 45 min. are also the best, as only then we get a glimpse of YSL's youth, and the movie also flashes forth towards his last days, all the while as we continue to see him in 1977. Fascinating. At some point, while trying to come up with yet another new collection, YSL sighs ""I created a monster and now I have to live with it"", wow. Gaspard Ulliel, an unknown to me, is brilliant in the role of YSL. Please note: there are several scenes with full male frontal nudity. Last but not least, director Bonello also composed the occasional score for the movie, but he also collected a ton of great songs for the movie from that era (CCR, Velvet Underground, the Four Seasons, as well as several classical music pieces from Maria Callas, just to name those). ""Saint Laurent"" had 10 nominations for the French equivalent of the Oscars, and it's easy to see why. This is an ambitious and mostly successful bio-pic.

I saw the other YSL bio-pic about a year ago and was eagerly awaiting this one. Not sure why it has taken this long, but ""Saint Laurent"" finally opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and I went to see it right away. The matinee screening where I saw this at was attended better than expected (I wouldn't have been shocked had there only been a couple of people). Bottom line: even it is a bit overlong, ""Saint Laurent"" is easily the better of the two YSL bio-pics from last year, so I'd readily recommend you check this out, be it in the theater, or eventually on Amazon Instant Video or DVD/Blu-ray. ""Saint Laurent"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1434153600,25,3305,4.470198675496689

6701688,4,B00O1VR5SY,"It has a very European, non linear story telling approach, which will frustrate viewers wanting something more traditional. But if your'e patient you will be rewarded. Because it suddenly becomes touching, when  Helmut Berger makes an appearance as the older, ravaged Yves. What it lacks, however, is any insight into what inspired him to create these sensational clothes. I've seen them, and they are breathtakingly beautiful. The other thing lacking is a serious look at his relationship with Pierre Berge. These two men remained devoted to each other until Yves death, so whatever it was that kept them a couple despite all odds, isn't on view here. Yves was a fragile, needy genius, and Berge was devoted to him, and that's only touched on. Without Berge, Yves would not have survived, despite his talent. And without Saint Laurent, Berge would probably have been another wealthy financier. But it's well worth watching, for the second half.

6701700,2,B00O1VR5SY,"Either Yves Saint Laurent was very one dimensional and uninspiring or this particular biopic was very one dimensional and uninspiring. Having seen several other documentaries about Laurent I'd say though his life did center around designing clothing with a single mindedness bordering on a disability as well as his substance abuse, relationship problems and propensity toward nervous breakdowns, the presentation of these circumstance it is more likely than not that this film is the problem and not the subject of it. I am very reluctant to recommend this picture so I do so only with the warning that it is over two hours of subtitles and a steady stream of the afore mentioned behaviors only occasionally interrupted by a fashion show here and there. But if you have an interest in this designer's life or his cloths and development of them and you do not mind subtitles (I didn't and generally don't but some really hate them) then you should go ahead and, knowing the film's limitations, give it a try.",1446854400,,1008,4.900584795321637

The movie is long, boring and the story line is all over the place. I did like the fact that the movie wanted to go further into Laurent's life instead of delving into the fashion side. But the reason why we following the designer and his brand was his creativity and style. The movie almost never goes into that. As for the storyline, I understand when movies don't tell a story chronologically. But if you're going to mix different periods of a subject's story, then tie them together so it makes sense. This film completely failed at that. And then there's the 2.5 hours that I had to sit through this. The film felt like it would never end.

I'm a huge fan of Yves Saint Laurent, YSL and the entire brand that he built. But this movie doesn't give the subject any relevance. At all. Ugh.",1445817600,3,948,4.468208092485549

6701706,1,B00O1VR5SY,"I loved the movie Yves Saint Laurent which shows how he started his career and also the documentary L'amour fou. I thought I would love this movie as well, however, it does not have much of a story except for showing disco scenes which are way too long. I wished they had included more of the story. I did not care for the poorly edited scene where YSL was at the building site hurt with khaki pants and brought home hurt with plaid pants. I am not sure whether that was to portray that there were numerous occasions like this or not, but it did not seem consistent.

In conclusion, I thought Pierre Niney was a much better actor as YSL and I thought the relationships portrayed between Pierre Niney and the actors Guillaume Gallienne and Charlotte Le Bonwere in the movie Yves Saint Laurent were outstanding.

If you haven't see Yves Saint Laurent with Pierre Niney, you must check it out.

8681485,3,B00O1VR5SY,"Ultimately depressing--like taking a bunch of downers and booze (which is mostly what we see Yves doing). I was amazed at how little of the film was devoted to his craft. The swinging 60s and languid 70s moments are few and far between.
There are a few fun scenes with Betty Catroux and LouLou de la Falaise--also, some interesting gay subculture scenes with titillating male nudity in the Bois de Bologne and his lover's apartement--so there's a bit of Cruisin' to break up the monotony. But then, lying around on couches taking Quaaludes and who knows what else, mixed with alcohol does produce a stupor.
PETA fans beware, the drug scenes (besides the big black snake hallucination) aren't for you.

Perhaps I was expecting something more on the side of documentary (my fault).
I can see the artistry of the film as we recreate Yve's quirky creativity that business (and once amorous) partner harnesses for profit.
The continuance of the YSL empire (as we see nowadays in cosmetics, bags, various designers working the aesthetic [Hedi Slimane, Anthony Vaccarello) is a tribute to Berge's and other investors feeling the zeitgeist of masses wanting designer labels.
But now, with all the houses churning out goods (have you looked at a Chanel bag lately? Not the quality at all)--it seems the party is about over.

I will also view the other film and see if there's a bit more to it.",1505088000,,1384,4.810924369747899
