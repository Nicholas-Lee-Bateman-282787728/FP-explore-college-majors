790441,3,6304096860,"This movie takes off to a slow start, holding too much boring commentary, as well as, a bunch of gypsy mumbo-jumbo.  Once the movie gets started it has its strong points, including a girl puking her own entrails.  It  definitely follows Fulci-style films with gore; however, it lacks the true  commentary and thrills of even mainstream flicks.",916272000,,343,4.964912280701754
790442,3,6304096860,"Fulci is a poor man's Dario Argento, as he tried to gross everyone out with Gates of Hell.  It's pretty slow and choppy, however, like all of Fulci's stuff, since he possesses the cinematic vision of a parapalegic.  He is the master of the gory tangent, however, and a couple of characters  get massacred in ways having nothing at all to do with the plot.  If you're  claiming to be a horror enthusiast (particularly a horror enthusiast) you  kind of have to see this, but don't go getting all excited about it.",915235200,,511,4.5

7862684,1,6304096860,"Nothing like the first one. Lucio Fulci is very disappointed at whoever made this travesty. And yeah, the artwork looks cool, You know why?? It is the stolen artwork from the Paragon VHS movie from 1980 named ""Funeral Home"". Not only did they steal the picture, they even used their same tagline too. At least they changed the colors, but otherwise identical. Bunch of thieves couldn't even do their own artwork. Another strange thing about this movie is at the end of the movie it is copyrighted 1997, but the whole film looked late 1980's. You could tell because of the hair and clothes. So, I watched it again and remember seeing something on the wall with the current date saying 1986. Meaning, it probably was filmed in late 1986 or early 1987. In other words, that means that this movie was filmed and layed dead and unreleased till 10 years later, before someone finally decided to think it was a good idead to release it. Any movie completed and left dormant for 10 years, should tell you something. Stay away.",1313798400,4,1018,4.629834254143646
7862685,4,6304096860,"Excellent film from times of my youth. (The European name: Through the Fire (1988)
Picture not bad, but darkish. In the American version telephone dialogue between the policeman and the girl (sister of the gone girl) is cut out. The picture on sharpness is close to BETACAM to a source. A sound in DD 2.0~448Kpbs (weak noise from imposing of a sound from other film is audible, it is an error from bad chains of a filtration at record from a source, but is not critical). Now such films do not remove! Of course: Old School! Such film deserves more expensive release on DVD.",1276387200,,574,4.528846153846154
7862686,1,6304096860,"dedicated to the memory of lucio fulci, this low budget thing is as bad as it gets and  probably caused fulci to  turn over in his grave. only thing decent about this film is the artwork which isn't that bad. too bad film isn't half as good",1255824000,2,240,4.085106382978723
7862687,1,6304096860,"Imagine a second-rate rip-off of Fulci's worst film of the 80's by a no name washed up director, without a lighting director or director of photography, without any of Fulci's talent or personal touches or even an attempt to copy them, absoutely no gore but, count 'em, 2 okay looking semi-zombies that immediately fall from one shot, painful miles of plot like mentally walking with a broken leg, with piles of 80s denim macho chesse, a final monster that looks like that thug turned huge muscle bound freak in Double Dragon: The Movie, only made by group on 8 year olds in an underground Vietnam sweatshop, on a straight from muffled audio VHS dupe, and that's this film to a T.
The one amazing thing about it is it looks to be shot on pretty good quality film and has a long, 'professional'-looking Hollywood end credit crawl. Almost makes one wonder what the film was originally entitled and perhaps more background info on it, The opening credits are intact, except for the title shot, replaced with computer graphics...
Makes ""Redneck Zombies"" look like a Kurosawa masterwork...",1070064000,7,1084,4.833333333333333
7862688,2,6304096860,"I have to begin this by saying that this Is Not a Lucio Fulci movie. In fact, it has nothing to do with Lucio whatsoever except in the ""shrewd marketing,"" copying of a successful title department. This is actually a very low budget movie directed by G.D. Marcum, and says that it is ""dedicated to the memory of Lucio Fulci"" on the back. ... So, keeping it brief because of its paper-thin plot and lack of effects, I'll break it down.
  This is your basic ""good vs. evil"" tale that, according to the back of the movie,  involved an ""occult group that initiates its members into joining the Darkness of Death"" fighting against a group of people who seek out those who make sacrifices to other gods besides Yahweh and kill them. During all of this, our main character's sister goes missing and she enlists an officer to help her after work. There are a few deaths to pad the bad acting, lack of gore/lack of effects, and there are a few moments of humor thrown into an otherwise jumbled ball of sometimes incomprehensible dialect and badly intertwining storyline transitions. I think some of the music woke me up for some of the highlights of the movie, too.
  Now, I'm going to give it 2 stars simply because a 1 means it belongs in the Cinema Sewer. Its not that bad, but you really, really, really have to like really cheap movies with no real monster shots (and a few zombie shots) to enjoy this. Maybe I should have been medicated first.",1024272000,3,1439,4.477099236641221
7862689,5,6304096860,"Although the plot is fairly inadequete ( I had to watch the end 4 times 'til I got it), the direction,music and gore are at Fulci's best and really makes up for incoherencies in the plot with excellent gore. My video is  knackered from playing the end sequence on my video, although it wound me  up that I didn't get it first time round, the finale is a classic Fulci. I  love the title/end music, so well organised. Fellow gore lovers, E mail me  with your oppinons and I will get back to you.",917136000,,494,4.223404255319149
