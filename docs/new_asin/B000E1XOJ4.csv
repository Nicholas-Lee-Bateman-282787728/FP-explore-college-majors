8104513,5,B000E1XOJ4,"I just go this DVD after watching the TV ad which promised ""Bikes, Broads, and Booze"" and I can honestly say, I wasn't disapointed. First of all, the quality is amazing. It's shot in High Def so it looks really cool. The locations are all legendary for anyone that rides----Laconia, Daytonna, and Sturgis. but I especially like the bonus footage of the nudie girls in the desert. That was HOT!",1139270400,,393,4.628571428571429
