I ordered another DVD and the movie was great!  The first order was terrible, but the movie itself was very enjoyable.",1349740800,,313,4.016129032258065
4077775,4,B0036K9CIM,"I just wanted to say that having just watched this wonderfully entertaining little gem, I had to come on here and give this one a thumbs up. As an unashamed fan of feel good Hallmark movies, I can safely attest to this being one of the very best I've seen. The story has been done before and how, but what makes this a solid little movie is the great chemistry between the two leads as well as a well written script with great supporting performances. It's feel good without being TOO schmaltz or cheesy and I for one heartily recommend this one to all incurable romantics out there.

A sweet story that's well made as it is entertaining",1340668800,,637,4.398305084745763

4077777,4,B0036K9CIM,"I really enjoyed this movie, aside from the scene in the hotel room I think this movie was nice. My nephew even enjoyed it! the dancing marketing scene was adorable. His partner was funny and played a good part, he made me laugh when he said ""What's Up!"". The owner of the marketing firm cracked me up with his thumps up! I recommend this movie and I myself watched it at least 5 times in a one month period.",1319673600,,408,4.177215189873418
4077778,5,B0036K9CIM,A good romantic type comedy for the whole family to enjoy.  No swearing or nudity.  Enjoyed it thoroughly!,1298246400,,106,4.833333333333333
4077779,5,B0036K9CIM,"I saw this movie on television, and loved it, but failed to get the title.  I googled lengthy descriptions trying to find it so I could add it to my collection.  I was delighted to finally find the name, and now that I've watched it again, it as good as maybe even better than I remembered.
  Basic story starts with a couple in love, but after being hurt badly in the past, she is very hesitant to make a commitment.  He is a guy with the habit of making a wish when he drives through a yellow light, and finally one of his wishes comes true.
  Very cute story, happy ending, even my teenage daughter AND her boyfriend liked it!",1291939200,14,629,4.191666666666666
4077780,5,B0036K9CIM,This feel was very well done for its genre and was a good family film. It is funny and well acted. It is one of the few films of its type that could be watched over and over again.,1290988800,5,180,3.641025641025641
4077781,5,B0036K9CIM,"This is a beautiful love story about a guy who goes back in time to win his true love's heart and hand in marriage before he marries a guy who would ultimately break her heart and shatter her trust in men forever. A love story with a wonderful happy ending that doesn't leave you disappointed. The plot unfolds beautifully with enough humor and heartfelt emotion to keep you watching with anticipation. As an added bonus, no foul language. Yeah !!",1275004800,38,447,4.6

4077785,5,B0036K9CIM,This movie is not for everyone I am sure but I truly enjoyed the time travel aspect of this film. If you like romance mixed with a little sci-fi and humor this is the movie for you. The ending was not what I expected but sometimes these movies tend to rushed at the end and don't really finish the plot as well as they could. I did feel this one ended strong. A great romantic comedy!,1456012800,,384,4.065789473684211

Jane has found her perfect soul-mate but because of deep hurt in her past is reluctant to dive in again.  It's up to her devoted and adoring fiance George to set things right; however, it may take forces outside of either of them.

4077797,1,B0036K9CIM,"For those who are concerned about suggested relationships, this movie starts out with the couple at home kissing each other on the couch with her in his lap. It becomes evident from the following conversation that they are living together and have been for some time. When he wants to marry her she becomes very upset because of her previous failed marriage and the fact that her ex-husband cheated on her. I would not recommend this movie for families.

4077812,5,B0036K9CIM,"I like good clean movies (or as clean as you can get nowadays). Before You Say I Do was really quite clean.  The only profanity is one use of ""crap"" and ""gay"" is heard once towards the middle.  The only violence is a car crash scene, but you don't see anything, you just know it happens.  The only sex is someone talks about how the groom ""was doin it"" upstairs with the wedding coordinator, and the groom kisses her one, even though he is engaged to someone else.  Despite these things, I really enjoyed the movie and will definitely watch it again. Most people would skip it because they think it is too predictable or ""lame"", but I like movies like that because I know I will be watching something that won't make me feel like I have just been ""slimed"".

George has found the girl of his dreams, and Jane feels the same about him, but she was so hurt by what happened with her first marriage, that she back out after accepting the ring.  She can't bring herself to tell George face-to-face, so leaves a message on his phone.  On his way to her apartment to try to talk to her, he makes a wish that he knew Jane before she got married, but when he runs a light a car hits him and he wakes up 10 years earlier, just days before Jane is to marry Doug.  Also, days before he and his colleague-friend Harvey Blinton are to be cheated out of a brilliant career in advertising by a co-worker.  George goes to work for Jane and her friend delivering their newspapers, and tries everything he can think of to win her over and to keep her away from Doug and help her to discover the truth about him, hoping that as he changes the past, he can finally have a happily every after future with Jane.

Overall, I loved the movie and will watch it again.",1379548800,,1741,4.248484848484848
4077813,5,B0036K9CIM,Perfect love story.  I love when a man knows what he wants and is not ashame to go after it.  Very sweet and wonderful love story.  It is truly one of my favorites. Would recommend it to anyone who love love stories and happy endings.,1377388800,,234,4.155555555555556
4077814,3,B0036K9CIM,"This is the clean family version of the guy who gets to travel back in time and fix the past. George wants to marry his girlfriend who loves him, but she is afraid to take the plunge due to a very bad first marriage experience. A despondent George makes a wish as he goes through a yellow light. He wishes he met Jane before she was married the first time. He gets into an accident and wakes up ten years earlier. A number of typical time-travel situations ensue in which his knowledge of the future creates some funny scenes and gives him an advantage. He manages to make fast friends with Jane without telling her what happened. Without spoiling the ending, I will say it has a bit of an unusual twist and is happy. The movie is fairly well done and the characters have a decent bit of chemistry for a low-budget film. For me, the big distraction is that when George goes back to 1999 from the year 2009, he and Jane look about the same, not ten years younger. You also see a few post-1999 cars pass by on the street. I assume this is because a lack of budget didn't allow for more expensive effects and a whole caravan of pre-1999 cars. After the first few scenes in 1999, this shortfall subsides into the background and isn't a huge deal. Time travel stories always involve some suspension of disbelief and this one is no different, but the time travel aspect isn't so outlandish that it takes over the story. The focus continues to be on the relationships. Because there is a fairly lengthy pre-time-travel sequence, there isn't as much time to develop secondary storylines in the rest of the movie. Overall, this is a pretty decent television romantic comedy and it is definitely worth checking out.",1376611200,,1705,4.503225806451613
4077815,5,B0036K9CIM,"This movie I had viewed several times on Hallmark channel, but never saw the beginning.  So I purchased it to see the beginning, the middle, and the end.  It was worth it.  Although, I did not like the girl in the beginning because she allowed a failed marriage to dictate the rest of her life, but the change came.  The story plot was well planned and executed.",1370822400,,362,4.358208955223881
4077816,4,B0036K9CIM,"Never mind that this film sidesteps the shouldering of real-life responsibility, that it instead tries to resolve a troubled relationship with a fantasy twist. 2009's BEFORE YOU SAY I DO is graced with two immensely likable romantic leads and a breezy tone and some good comic moments. The final decider for me, though, is that the premise rests on my favorite sci-fi conceit, that of time travel.

George Murray is an adman. Jane Gardner writes a popular advice column. George and Jane are very much in love, and so it's no surprise that one night George breaks out the shiny rock and the proposal. What's eye-opening is Jane's response which is along the lines of ""Uhhh..."" Jane adores George, she does. But she's held hostage by her disastrous first marriage. She bears the emotional and psychological scars brought about by an unfaithful ex-husband. Jane adores George, but she runs away.

George indulges one superstition. Did you know that if you make a wish while the traffic light is turning yellow, that chances are you'd get in a car accident? Driving in a frenzy to get to Jane's apartment, George suffers a fender bender and a concussion and, finally, unconciousness. When he wakes up, he finds himself ten years ago, in 1999, three days before Jane gets married. But not if George can help it.

You can see why it takes some time for him to accept that he'd time traveled to the past. He does all the logical things. He rushes over to Jane's apartment (only it's not Jane's apartment). He visits his advertising agency and is shocked when no one recognizes him or believes him. There's a fun sequence in which George is challenged to prove his advert creds and he reels off a series of catch phrases from upcoming classic TV campaigns (like ""Can you hear me now?"" and Budweiser's ""Whassup!?""). He walks away, having left a dubious impression. Nevertheless, the ad agency's boss thinks him an ""advertising savant"" and is anxious to hire him on. But George has more important things to do.

He finally tracks Jane down in the struggling offices of the Don't Throw Away newspaper, and he manages to ingratiate himself as the latest paper delivery boy (he refers to himself as an ""overgrown circulation engineer""). He starts to work on Jane. Except Jane at this stage is committed to her dog of a fiance. She perceives George as this friendly but very odd subordinate. If Nicholas Sparks and H.G. Wells got together, they couldn't have set it up better.

It's getting so that a romantic comedy featuring David Sutcliffe is a must-see for me (check out THE WISH LIST if you get the chance). Sutcliffe has got this laid back approach and comes across like a regular guy. He's got easy chemistry with his leading lady, Jennnifer Westfeldt who, by the way, is pretty dang lovable. This is one of those films in which you for one minute don't doubt there's a happy ending in store. Brad Borbridge and Lauren Holly play the respective best friends, and I don't mean to be a downer but what the hell happened to Lauren Holly's career that she's now relegated to these second banana roles?

What distinguishes 1999? Off the top of my head, I couldn't tell you. Seems like the film establishes 1999 by the absence of smart cars and Hummers and a rampant social media. Whatever. I like this movie, mostly because I like the cast so much (and time travel). The ending does raise certain tricky questions for the persnickety time travel buff, to which I say, ""parallel timeline, pal, roll with it."" If Star Trek can pull it off, why not this one?",1366416000,6,3543,4.697262479871176

4077818,4,B0036K9CIM,"I admit I'm a sucker for chick flicks. Real life can be harsh, but chick flicks allow you to escape and reclaim your innocence. The two main actors are likable and engaging.
