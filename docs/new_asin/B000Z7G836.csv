8522155,4,B000Z7G836,"This is one of the less expensive DVD mridangam course you can find. From a retired man's wallet perspective, this is great. From a person wanting one chunk of info to work with at a time, it isn't.

N. Ramakrishnan is a very competent mridangam player. He explains the various mnemonics used in training players reasonably well and gives consistent examples throughout the course.  However, the course is not broken up into individual lessons giving just one batch of information at a time before moving on to the next trick you need to learn. Sure, you can use the pause button. You can take notes as Ramakrishnan explains and shows what happens when.

But if you're like me -- and I certainly hope there aren't too many of us -- this is a bit of a chore. Remembering what the guru just said and writing it down is a skill that slips with age. Being quick about the pause button also takes some attention and forethought. You'll have to go through the lesson -- and they're all presented one right after another -- a couple times to get the idea.

Now, having said all that, and taking in consideration how much this course will move a person toward a nominally competent level of playing in a reasonable period of time, I will gladly say that the DVD is worth the money I paid (buying it off Amazon but not on eBay). With sufficient practice and attention to details of hand positions &c, I should be able to at least produce some of the riffs familiar to mridangam accompaniment of veenas, flautists and singers. I hope.

I might advise getting a copy of ""Mrudunga Swabodhini/Mrudangam Self-Instructor"" by Dorairaja Iyer. The lessons in the book follow exactly the lesson material covered by N. Ramakrishnan. If you're almost past the point of short term memory without notes, the book will give you context help in learning the patterns in the DVD lessons.

The DVD is definitely worth the money. Seeing how the drum is played will lead you toward good results.",1362441600,3,1966,4.635057471264368
