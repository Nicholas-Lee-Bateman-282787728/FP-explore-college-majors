3042671,5,B000ZM1MRS,"I couldn't believe how LONG I waited for this movie to be released when it finally was.  I remember back in 1996 Arnold said on some TV show such as Entertainment Tonight or one of those shows ""I guarantee by the end of '96 Terminator 3 will be out"".  Yeah RIGHT!  As the years passed, I began to wonder if the film would ever be made.

When I finally got a chance to watch it, I didn't even care about the quality of the storytelling or the special effects or action scenes or ANYTHING like that- I was just happy to see a movie I've waited an incredibly long time for.

And my opinion is that it's a really good movie, though obviously not as memorable as Terminator 2.  Really though, not many movies ARE as good as that one, so we can hardly blame the third installment for coming up a little short.

The movie still contains plenty of action, excitement, heart-racing fighting segments, and an interesting (though incredibly bizarre when you really think about it) storyline.  I consider Terminator 3 a quality movie overall.",1243382400,,1030,4.5
3042672,5,B000ZM1MRS,"I don't remember much about the plot of Swordfish. It may have been half decent or had some good lines in it. But most importantly it does feature a nude Halle Berry. She is already something else with clothes on, but nude? Bull market! This DVD is well worth the price to see Halle Berry's impressive cocoa casabas on full unclad display.

It also stars John Travolta as an anti-terrorism agent or something, and it has Halle Berry nude in it. To repeat, Halle Berry appears nude for a scene in Swordfish. If you would like to see Halle Berry nude anytime you want I would recommend buying this DVD. You can do what I do and pause that part so you can look at Halle Berry nude for as long as you like. (I'm trying to make it into a poster.) Like I said I don't remember the plot too much, because I mainly focused on Halle Berry in the nude. She's hot. And nude in this movie!

Haven't watched the Terminator movie yet.",1240617600,,920,4.251428571428572

8235940,5,B000ZM1MRS,"This is 2 very good movies in one package. Seperately they are just ok, Terminator 3 was definitely not the best of the series. Swordfish is ok as well but most girls don't like that movie. Together in one package its a great deal and they both have some decent special features. A great find!",1355270400,,293,4.345454545454546
8235941,4,B000ZM1MRS,"Swordfish is great when it comes to matters like secret societies, just like Dr. Strangelove.  Rise of the Machines, well I'm not that into machines.",1296864000,,149,4.96
