8507041,1,B006ZL1PAM,"This is six movies on two bluray disks.  It appears the bluray quality was sacrificed to cram the three on the disks.

I tried to watch 'No code of conduct,'  the video quality stunk, with noise and blotches throughout.  The script and acting was pathetic.  If you are into car chases and stuff blowing up it might be up your alley, but not mine. Throw in the godawful video quality and it isn't worth watching.

Disgusted, I scanned the other movies for video quality only.

 'Hidden assassin' - poor video quality - noisy and grainy.

 'The Yards' is passable, but not great.

'Equilibrium' is excellent video quality.

 'The Lookout' is a mixed bag of very good and rather poor quality.

'Supercop' is also a mix of very good and poor video.",1417910400,2,744,4.580152671755725

8507043,3,B006ZL1PAM,"Once I opened this and realized there were only 2 discs I was worried about the quality of the blu ray transfers on the movies.  I bought it mostly for Equilibrium which thankfully has a great transfer, looks beautiful, and despite being listed as having 5.1 dts it actually provides 7.1 which is even better.  However The Lookout has a terrible transfer, sometimes looking worse than the dvd version.  The sound quality for it was not bad, but not great either.  The Yards also has a sub-par transfer and while being listed as 5.1 surround actually only plays in 2.0 stereo.  Have not yet watched the other movies, but I give it a 3 stars because while Equilibrium is excellent it is clear the others are questionable.",1393891200,3,719,4.6299212598425195
8507044,4,B006ZL1PAM,"I've been looking for a high-quality copy of my guilty pleasure ""Equilibrium"" and this is it.  I wanted the DTS-MA 5.1 audio and a solid 1080p video transfer.  I was not disappointed.  There is a moderate amount of film-grain in the image, but that's to be expected from the film.  I'd give the Video a 4-stars and the audio a 5-stars.

I don't know about the other 5 movies on there because I don't care about them, but I imagine they are comparable.",1390521600,,451,4.385542168674699
8507045,4,B006ZL1PAM,"I bought this due to it being the best domestic transfer and encode of Equilibrium available on Bluray--considering that you have to pay far, far more money for a slightly better transfer on the Japanese HD-DVD or Blu-ray, it is still well worth the price for fans of this movie.  I also watched and enjoyed The Watch, but considered this pure bonus.  I haven't bothered watching any of the other movies, but can confirm that Supercop is dubbed.",1366848000,6,445,4.6923076923076925
8507046,2,B006ZL1PAM,"title says it all. The video quality is good, but no subs make it a huge bummer. Jackie Chan's show is dubbed and shouldn't be...sad",1364169600,2,132,4.32
