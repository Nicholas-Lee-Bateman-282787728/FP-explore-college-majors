2246993,2,B0007WQGSG,"This premise could have been good, but it was brought down by lousy scripting.  The animation was of a high level, like ""Reboot,"" & the voice work was stellar. Patty Jausoro was a producer on this and is great with animation... as well as other things.",1159660800,4,252,4.478260869565218
2246994,5,B0007WQGSG,"We just rented this video and found it to be one of the best written shows we've seen in a long time. It's a shame it's not still running. As parents of teenagers, we found the humor quite funny yet it was pretty clean. You can safely watch it with a ""tween"" / teen. The NR rating was a bit daunting so we pre-screened  some of it first and found it tamer than most PG/PG13 shows.",1151193600,2,380,4.0
2246995,2,B0007WQGSG,"Could of been a lot worse I guess, but I'm not shedding any tears over the show's quick cancellation. The problems with the show is that it tries that formula of mixing quirky family humor for the grown ups with cheap gags for the kiddies but it becomes just one big mess. Also, the children are pretty horrible characters, there's nothing to empathize with especially since they look SO modelled over market research. (Perhaps a comment of the shallow nature of the current video game industry? Unlikely.) They're just smug and self-absorbed but always painted as better people than the parents in the show. UPN's way of trying to be hip I guess. Patrick Warburton is the saving grace of the series and I guess there's a few game references in the first couple of episodes to validate your taste. In the end, nothing really memorable about this series.",1125446400,18,853,4.731543624161074
2246996,4,B0007WQGSG,I enjoyed this short-lived series on UPN and was delighted to hear it was coming to DVD.  I purchased it from Suncoast and quickly found out there are problems with the menus on both discs.  Suncoast replaced the set I bought and I encountered the same problems.  I recently recieved my third set from Suncoast and found the same problems.  In all cases the curser is missing from the menus and it is impossible to chose an option.  In spite of this I would recommend this DVD set because of the content and the extras.  As long as you don't have any problems navigating the menus.  Has anyone else had this problem?,1123200000,5,616,4.446428571428571
2246997,5,B0007WQGSG,"Very intriguing premise, and tons of in-jokes for anyone who played video games vigorously as a kid.  The voices are excellent.  Many of them are familiar (Patrick Warburton, Lucy Liu, etc.), and the production quality is generally excellent. In particular, a Sarah Silverman-esque young comedienne is quite good in her role as one of the character's mothers.

Well worth checking out.",1122768000,4,385,5.278688524590164
8052968,4,B0007WQGSG,"I liked the show on UPN.
But too bad for 6 episodes it has, it was canceled due to low ratings. People should've like it because it's like watching Seth McFarlane's TV shows/Movies because of there was a 300-pound talking doglike creature who talks, robs pawn shops, and smokes cigars and other comedy things you see on TV.",1472601600,,323,4.586206896551724

8052970,3,B0007WQGSG,"Nice idea, but writing seemed cookie cutter. This may be because they were hampered by production costs. (Example: ""We only have the time and money to create three building interiors. So only write stuff that would happen there."")",1431216000,,230,5.078947368421052

8052973,4,B0007WQGSG,great to watch with family if you want a good laugh. we also really like patrick warburton's theatrical voice. good family fun...,1363392000,,129,4.909090909090909
8052974,1,B0007WQGSG,"Rating this one star is still giving unworthy praise.

I am sure teens who have not had to experience the hardships of youthful overindulgence likes this series.  It makes sex/rebellion/and crude humor the focal point of the show and the family the show is about centers on this subject.  A very immature, weak, unethical, trashy, and sad way of making money by film makers.  If you want your own kids to end up in the gutter - then by all means - show them this.  Garbage in - garbage out is a law of nature.

Something of quality that lasts needs not constantly RELY on crude ""humor"" and references to sexually related subjects.  Within the first few minutes the main character talks about his physical relationship with his wife - with kids present - (at least the authors thought enough to make them a married couple); there is a scene where they specifically reference their son's private parts; the viewer is taken to the mall to watch the father being put in a situation where his daughter asks his opinion of a see-through, lingerie-like undergarment she is contemplating on purchasing (which she says she has to buy while eluding to an upcoming date) and this info is texted to a network of her friends for everyone to ""get a laugh"" over (at least the father had enough sense to say she was not going on the date - shock!).

I quit watching it at this point (should have stopped earlier but was thinking it would clean up and i could later skip this trashy part) b/c the junk kept right on showing up.  The first ten minutes or so told me why this immaturely-based show was cancelled - and thankfully it was.  I am glad I only spent 2.00 on it (to get my total Amazon bill up over the free shipping cut off).  This attempt to make debauchery laughable now has been destroyed and resides in my trashcan as I would definitely not want to pass this on to someone who might even think of exposing their kids to it.

And people wonder why their teens are rebellious, hedonistic, and end up in the gutter.",1322697600,,2008,4.456284153005464
8052975,3,B0007WQGSG,"I like this show. I watched it when it first aired, and caught it whenever I could, which UPN made difficult as they kept moving it.  I like all the characters, though Billy (the Son) and Turbo (the 'Pet') could be somewhat grating.

Patrick Warburton, Lucy Liu, Rachel Dratch, Artie Lange and Marie Matiko do great jobs, but all the voices are fairly strong. Jennifer Coolidge's character, well, that depends on if you like her style or not.

Essentially a sitcom, Game Over used many stereotypes of that genre, and used a couple too many throwaway jokes, but it's place in gamer culture offered it something unique, and it's a shame it didn't get the chance to do more. I wish it lasted longer so the world could've been fleshed out.

My favorite episode is the second, with Billy going out with a Japanese Anime(?) girl, and Alice taking the C.A.T.S., a test to see what she can do in their world. This leads to what's probably my favorite line in the series:

""I'm sorry kiddo. You'll meet other girls.""

""Will they shoot rainbows out of their butts?""

""...You'll meet other girls.""

Now as for the DVD, it says it's complete, but it's pretty bare.  It has all aired episodes as well as the unaired sixth, but it's missing the unaired pilot, where Marisa Tomei voiced Raquel.

For special features, only ""Watch Closely"" is worth checking out, to see where the crew slipped in their names and various other tidbits. The character bios don't tell you anything you won't know if you watch the series, and the ""Trivia Game""  is a series of easy questions about things in the show, and winning lets you see a trailer, one I remember seeing on tv before. The Progression Reel is a kind of neat, but is only a minute or two long and really nothing special.

Game Over was a nice little show and ended before it could do much, and while this dvd is lacking, it's likely all us fans are going to get. At least we can now add it to our collections.",1236470400,,1942,4.470254957507082
8052976,3,B0007WQGSG,"If you were heavy into video games in the late '80s and early '90s, then you'll understand and enjoy this series. I liked it when it was first on and never understood why it didn't last. Unlike many shows, it was funny without becoming vulgar, cute without becoming sickening.",1214870400,,276,4.653061224489796
8052977,3,B0007WQGSG,"At the end of a long day of video gaming, all those characters have to go somewhere, right? This set of eight shorts, each the length of a TV slot, follows them home.

If ""The Incredibles"" hadn't already done something similar, only more clever, this would have looked a bit stronger. Still, it stands on its own well enough, and the child characters (teenage Alice and tweenage Billy) are are given better roles. Alice's attitude, in particular, has a lot going for it.

It has its clever moments, though. The CGI polygons are visible fairly often, reminding the viewer of the limits of 2004-era gaming hardware for PCs. The super-powered anime exchange student is good, too, as Billy's first crush. He's overawed when she flies him around, leaving a multi-colored trail behind her.  When she has to go back to Japan (the country), he's heart-broken.

Dad:  You'll meet other girls.

Billy, inconsolable: Will they shoot rainbows out of their butts?

It's funny, entertaining, and thoroughly forgettable. So, if you have an evening you don't plan to remember, give it a shot.
