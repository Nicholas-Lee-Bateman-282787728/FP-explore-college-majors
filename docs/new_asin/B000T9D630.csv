2895088,5,B000T9D630,"Total Body Toning includes two 20-min workouts, the first one works the arms and the second is for total body toning, each using a mat and one 2 lb toning ball.  I've been doing these intermediate workouts, pairing one or the other with different Stott workouts, for a month now, and I see more definition in my arms.  I've also noticed more strength in my arms, and my students (I teach water fitness) have noticed the additional arm muscle definition! For example, I paired the second Total Body Toning workout with Stott's Ultimate Sculpting workout (another 20-min workout) for an outstanding 40-min workout!  The combination of using toning balls and flex band cannot be beat for a home exerciser.  I highly recommend Stott Total Body Toning workouts!",1352419200,,756,4.929133858267717
2895089,4,B000T9D630,"I really enjoyed this workout. The DVD actually offers two, appr. 22 minutes long, one concentrating on the arms and the other on the whole body. It's nicely instructed and easy to follow. I recommand it, especially for beginners.",1247443200,5,230,4.923076923076923

8208168,1,B000T9D630,"Horrible...worst DVD I've ever purchased.  I have a lot of SPRI bands and used them 3 times a week in a club in Iowa and then later in Chicago.  Now that I live in central IL, I wanted some workouts to go through the routines instead of doing the ones that I have in books.  This was the only company I found that provided specific DVDs for bands.  It is a waste of money.  There was about 5 to 7 minutes of advertising in the beginning and the workout was only about 10 minutes.  Additionally, they only used one band whether they were doing squats or upper body presses which is ridiculous because you cannot get resistance from the same band when your arms are lowered versus standing upright and pushing hands to the ceiling.  I switched my own bands, but they did so few repetitions on any given motion that you would miss the first one or two moves by switching bands.",1466812800,3,874,4.325153374233129

8208170,5,B000T9D630,"I'm sort of an equipment nut when it comes to exercise (toys?).  I own and use a battle rope, kettle bell, dumb bells, jump rope etc.  some have their uses, others seem like a bit of a stretch.

Tubes and resistance bands can be unwieldily.  I've seen some DVD's where they weren't used much, or the coach tried to do too many exercises with them.  Tubing takes a little bit of time to set up, and if explained well they are beneficial.  If explained poorly, you might hate them.  This DVD, especially for the beginner user of tubes, is perfect.  Scott (the coach) does an amazing job of explaining and transitioning from one exercise to another.  I strongly recommend.  The video is short, but you can work up do doing it 2x if you so desire.  Be warned, the ab circuit requires a pilates band with handles (which I didn't purchase).  I thought I could get away without it, but after watching I realized I couldn't.

I hope you enjoy!",1462579200,,935,4.429411764705883
8208171,5,B000T9D630,"Good workout DVD, I just wish it wasn't too pricey. It left me sweating & wanting more. I paired this w/ my SPRI Lateral Resistor and it's a perfect combo. Definitely recommend this DVD for sure",1448582400,4,194,4.416666666666667
8208172,5,B000T9D630,Again the DVD's from this pilates series are good workout DVD's but the focus is on first developing strong postural muscles and learning proper movement form.  This will serve you well down the road vs. just a fat burning workout!,1414540800,6,231,4.775
8208173,5,B000T9D630,"Not your average workout DVD. These Pilates series DVD's are designed for proper body conditioning to avoid/rehab. injuries and to develop postural muscle strength as a much needed strength foundation as opposed to just for building ""mirror muscles.""",1414540800,2,250,5.605263157894737
8208174,5,B000T9D630,Very good for upper arms body toning. My brother in law uses it daily and has helped him greatly to build a little muscle tone.,1399420800,3,127,4.12
8208175,4,B000T9D630,"I bought this DVD because I needed other exercise videos to use with my resistance bands. I was tired of my same old workout. This video is pretty decent. It had different exercise moves than the one that came with my resistance band. The Upper Body Workout uses the stretch cord tubing with handles, but the Core Workout uses a Pilates fitness band with handles that I do not own, so really cannot give a review on that part of it. My resistance band with handles can be changed up with different weight resistance, so this workout can be used for a long time as I increase my resistance.  Overall, I would recommend this workout video for Upper Body.",1392422400,7,652,4.4789915966386555
8208176,5,B000T9D630,"I enjoy the workouts in this series a lot. Moira has a soothing voice and her instructions are easy to follow. There is some relaxing music in the background, and the studio where the video was filmed looks very nice. The two workouts are neither too long nor too short, and on days when I want to do more I just do them both. You can also vary the difficulty by using balls that are heavier or lighter.
The routines are 20 minutes and tone your entire body. Pilates is said to help with posture and muscle tone, and I can feel the difference when I do regular pilates workouts.",1363392000,,578,4.263636363636364
