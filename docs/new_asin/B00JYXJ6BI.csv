8654631,5,B00JYXJ6BI,"This documentary was made by BBC and it shows its quality. At the beginning, the narrator says: ""This document will show you something about dinosaurs you have never seen before"". He is right.

The show has 2 parts. The first one explains the scenario how a tyrex could attack, kill and eat a triceratop. In another instance, it explains how a triceratop could have fought off a tyrex. To do that, the film makers built a bio-mechanic, life-size, head of tyrex. Then they put it on a forklift.

They also draw conclusions from fossils, live alligators, ostriches, and sharks. The narration is exciting and lively. It makes me feel as if I was in the middle of the fight between these 2 pre-historic animals.

Above all, the computer 3D graphic helps make it an excellent documentary.

The second part of the show talks about velociraptors, ankylosaurs, and tarbosaurus.

If you like dinosaurs, this is a MUST-HAVE.",1399334400,2,914,4.833333333333333
