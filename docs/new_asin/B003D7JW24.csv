4111481,5,B003D7JW24,"Next to Inception and Predators, Scott Pilgrim Vs The World was my most anticipated film of the year. Edgar Wright  has yet to disappoint as a director and the film looked like it would feature plenty of comedy and action with a little bit of romance that would be presented in a unique way that would hopefully satisfy that part of me that always seems to be craving something more original from Hollywood. Thankfully, like a child who has a strong idea of what that big Christmas present is sitting under the tree, that's exactly what I received.

The entire film looks fantastically retro as certain sounds are brought to life with animated text while weapons the characters use are heavily pixelated like they're taken straight out of an 8-bit video game. Scott Pilgrim recycles recognizable video game sounds in a way that triggers nostalgia, but uses them in a way that feels fresh. Even the way the film is edited like the way the split screen is used to show all seven evil exes on screen at once in the trailer or how Scott's everyday activities bleed together because he's so absorbed in his thoughts about Ramona seems to be done in a way that makes the film stand out in comparison to others.

The writing may be Scott Pilgrim's best attribute. There are so many witty one-liners littered throughout the film and the storyline unfolds in a way that grabs hold of your attention the second that 8-bit version of the Universal Logo comes up on screen and doesn't let go until those last remaining seconds of the film. The cast was surprisingly solid, as well. I was already excited about Chris Evans and Jason Schwartzman being in the film, but Michael Cera, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Ellen Wong, and Kieran Culkin all managed to make a pretty lasting impression with this film.

Scott Pilgrim Vs The World is one of the most inventive, cleverly written, eye-popping, and visually appealing action comedies to ever grace the big screen. While Edgar Wright's best work can certainly be debated, Scott Pilgrim is arguably his most enjoyable work yet.",1281571200,,2057,4.753501400560224

The funniest part of this disaster was the 10 year old's comment when it was over ""you paid $4 for that!"". Yeah...",1525219200,,283,4.2592592592592595

The bad: There is no digital copy. Code expired in 2011.",1516838400,,149,3.966666666666667
4111502,5,B003D7JW24,My favorite movie of all time. The editing is superb and unique and it really puts you into the feeling that you're watching a comic book. I've watched it at least 8 times already and it never gets old. Such an amazing film that I would recommend to anyone.,1516838400,,257,4.26530612244898

4111506,5,B003D7JW24,"One of the greatest masterpieces of all time! Scott Pilgrim vs. The World does an amazing job of illustrating so many aspects of young and maturing love. It covers the subtleties of happiness and passion in a relationship and how they can relate to past relationships and heartbreak. The transitions for example showed how a lot of time can pass without realizing it when one is distracted or depressed, as Scott was when dating Knives but thinking of Ramona.

I've watched it a few times over the years and it is always as fresh and amazing as ever!",1516406400,,550,4.612244897959184
4111507,5,B003D7JW24,"HIGHLY underrated movie. It's a quirky movie that hits multiple genres. It has action, romance, witty dry humor, fantasy...

Definitely give it a shot if you are looking for something fresh and different. There is nothing like it (which is probably why it failed at the theaters, people want more of the same )",1516406400,,310,4.7407407407407405
4111508,5,B003D7JW24,"Not usually into the comic book/manga type stuff, but this was thoroughly entertaining - I've watched it about five times and it hasn't gotten old yet

What I liked most: the transitions between themes - I don't think I've seen this much attention to detail before
What I liked least: why aren't my Amazon orders hand-delivered by a rollerskating cutie? =(",1516060800,,356,4.836065573770492
4111509,5,B003D7JW24,"My favorite movie of all time!  Great easter eggs and little jokes, sound bits, and writing to video game and pop culture.  Small details in the movie make it something i've enjoyed watching many times.",1515974400,,202,4.742857142857143

8394703,5,B003D7JW24,"How had I never seen this before?!  This film is AWESOME.  It's now in my top 5 alltime comic book movies.  Follow Scott as he has to fight his new girlfriends 7 evil exes.  Fun side note is this move Stars both Chris Evans (Captain America) and Brie Larson (soon to be Captain Marvel).  The first time I watched it, it took me about 30 minutes to adjust to the editing and directing style.  But I swear now everytime I watch it I see something new to appreciate.  I've always been a fan of Michael Cera since Arrested Development but this is now his defining role to me.  Oh and the girlfriend...can't think of her name but she plays Ramona Flowers is so dang charming, I really need to learn her name and seek out other work of hers!",1527465600,,735,4.237410071942446
