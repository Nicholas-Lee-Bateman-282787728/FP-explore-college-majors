3101155,5,B0012ZO33W,"An interesting addition to the Sherlock oeuvre. The production values are quite amazing, I had no idea Russian television was this good.  The sets and costumes are true to the era with an interesting eastern veneer that is not annoying or glaring - just interesting. Subtitles are clear, the scripts accurately reflect the stories - many of the adventures are blended together. The highlight of this series is the casting; Vasily Livanov as Sherlock is as good as Jeremy Brett (seriousy) and Vitaly Solomin is a revelation as Dr. Watson; fine supporting cast. Get this and enjoy!",1239840000,15,579,4.969072164948454
3101156,5,B0012ZO33W,"This is one of the greatest set of movies you will ever get. Only downfall is that it is too short with just 5 films. But hey, what can we do about it, that is what directors decided to do. BTW I have heard that Russians will be shooting some new films based on the rest of the stories of Sherlock Holmes. Though I am sure, nothing will ever touch this set. The actor portraying Holmes seemed to be a real life Holmes, that is the feeling I get when watching this film. I have seen some UK made Holmes shows, but they cannot touch this one. Sure, if you get into them, you can watch them with joy and suspense, but the set of actors this Russian made Holmes has, is just unbeatable. They play their roles to the tee. Dr. Watson is great too, the actor playing him has sadly died.

Here are the set details, thanks to [...]:

As stated in the title, Queen of England thought that actor playing a role of Holmes was the best Holmes portrayal on TV and gave him an award.

One last thing, wait till you pop the DVD into your player and hear the introductory music.....OHHHHH MY..... you WILL LOVE IT!!!!! One of the best scores ever!!!",1228521600,25,2002,4.494475138121547

8248601,5,B0012ZO33W,"I really like this series. So what that it's not as good as granada version. There is no sherlock holmes film that I've seen that I didn't like.
However, in the listing of the product details it gives the actors as Vitalij Solomin, & Vasilij Livanov, when in actuality they are Vitaliy, & Vasiliy",1511308800,,296,4.5
8248602,5,B0012ZO33W,Excellent!,1492819200,,10,10.0
8248603,5,B0012ZO33W,"I adore this series. The settings are beautifully well done, the actors are quirky and excellent in their roles (particularly Vitaly Solomon, who plays a very Doyle-style version of the good Dr. Watson), and the music is wonderful. Really, sometimes the series is more British than Britain, despite being filmed mostly in Latvia.

Of course it's in Russian, with subtitles, so if you're all right with subtitles I would highly recommend this.  There are some excellent moments, both the intense and comedic types, including some wonderful scenes of Dr. Watson and Sherlock Holmes when they'd first met.

And I almost, almost forgive their overly-American caricature of Sir Henry Baskerville of Hound fame, cowboy chaps, silly music, and all. As the rest of the series is so excellent, it's well worth watching. My school-aged (and non-Russian-speaking) children even enjoyed them.",1453852800,3,880,5.316546762589928
8248604,2,B0012ZO33W,"The musical theme is enjoyable. However I didn't get much out of the stories or the bleak and black atmosphere as background for some rather boring stories. I could be wrong...and you MIGHT enjoy this Russian Sherlock....but the actor playing Sherlock didn't have the ""charisma"" of, say a Cumberbatch or Basil Rathbone Sherlock Holmes. That's my opinion....sorry to say.....as I really wanted to LOVE this set...but...thumbs down....at least for me.",1448755200,,449,5.428571428571429
8248605,5,B0012ZO33W,"The BEST Sherlock !!!
All actors were playing with happiness and refined irony.
You will feel their real love for original stories.
That is a perfect base and a lucky fate for the Great Film!",1358208000,,191,4.485714285714286
8248606,4,B0012ZO33W,"The quality is fantastic, the filming amazing and hard to believe it was not made in Briton.  Really love the actors as well.  However for me it was hard to get the subtitles on the one TV I planned on watching it on, and they go by fairly fast for a slow reader as I am.  And I do wish someone had does voice overs as a choice.  I would have spent more money for a quality English voices to do the voice overs.",1329609600,2,411,3.857142857142857
8248607,5,B0012ZO33W,"Delivery from NY to Calgary, Canada took a few days longer than it was anticipated by the seller because it was in fact the international delivery. The items were not damaged, superior quality movies, detailed subtitles. Me and my partner really enjoyed Russian version of Sherlock Holmes; it was a great experience we never had before. I personally recommend to wach buy it and excercise someting unseen previously. Thanks seller. Kind respect!",1317254400,3,445,5.194444444444445
8248608,3,B0012ZO33W,"To be blunt, the series is interesting and have a dark edge.  Livanov, as good as he is in the role, seems to be a caricature of Holmes.  The Inverness cape, the deer stalker cap, and the magnifying glass (all which derive from William Gillette's portrayal of Holmes in the early twentieth century) are overdone. Frankly, he does not come up to the level of either Jeremy Brett or Basil Rathbone, who were both the greatest Holmes of their respective generations.  Despite comments to the contrary, it takes an Englishman to do the role correctly; at least the Livanov version is set in the 19th century.  I found the Dr. Who version of Holmes (Sherlock on the PBS) to be very anachronistic and hence a failure.  Holmes is a character of his age.  In a word, Brett is Holmes.  I will at least say at least the Russian series does include the Study in Scarlet and His Last Bow, which have not been filmed recently.  The Dr. Who ""A Study in Pink,"" suggested by a Study in Scarlet, loses all of its punch because it takes the Mormon theme out of the equation.  The Russian version of the Study in Scarlet followed the novel rather closely, although I do not know why the writers of the screen play took the first several chapters of the Study in Scarlet (the meeting of Homes and Watson) and linked them with the Speckled Band (Motley Ribbon in the Russian subtitles).  All and all I am a purist so I will stick with Brett, although the Russian films are much better than the recent videos of the Dr. Who Holmes.",1301788800,2,1509,4.434782608695652
8248609,3,B0012ZO33W,"Granada Television series are much better. Jeremy Brett is much, much better in this role than Livanov. (I am Russian.)",1295740800,3,119,5.0
8248610,5,B0012ZO33W,"comes with decent English subtitles. Even if you don't speak Russian get this.
Probably the best Sherlock Holmes adaptation out there.",1263859200,11,134,5.428571428571429
