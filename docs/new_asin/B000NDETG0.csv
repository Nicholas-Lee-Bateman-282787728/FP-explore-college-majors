8177059,3,B000NDETG0,"I bought this DVD for my 2 1/2 year old son who loves trains. I wanted to get away from the Thomas and Friends to show him the real trains and the model trains. He enjoys watching this movie while playing with all his trains. However from an adult standpoint, its a bit dull. No fancy graphics or special effects. Its fine for the younger kids.",1310342400,,344,4.2272727272727275
