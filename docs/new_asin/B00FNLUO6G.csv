6015457,5,B00FNLUO6G,"I am not really a fan of documentaries. I will sometimes watch one and will enjoy it, but The Crash Reel is so much more! It's like an actual movie complete with plotlines and characters you love and some you may not (yes you Shaun White!) I watched this twice in two days and was moved to tears many times during both viewings. Kevin had it all and was headed for Olympic gold when he had his accident, but his story is far from over. I only see him doing great things in the years to come. Do yourself a favor and watch this incredible film, you will not be sorry!",1389657600,8,566,4.108108108108108
6015458,5,B00FNLUO6G,"This is a documentary for those that love anything in their life.  Be it family, friends, triumph or extreme sports...  It's the difficult but heroic story of a fantastic snowboarder.  One who had it all before a fateful accident and regained it all afterwords.  The best part of the journey is that the film captured so well the experiences of those around him.  His family, friends and competitors are given the time to learn and speak about his challenges their own experiences as Kevin re-groups.  Oh and on top of it all, there is gorgeous snowboarding footage & wonderful music.  Please release a soundtrack!!!",1388361600,12,616,4.865384615384615
6015459,4,B00FNLUO6G,"I am in many sports but one activity that puts fear in my bones is when I mountain bike down the hill to shave off 1/10 of second of my own record, time after time, every single time. Watch this compelling documentary with your kids since it will allow you to communicate more effectively if you happen to have a loved one in your family who enjoys adrenaline rush and you find yourself lost in the process. Wish Kevin and his loving family lots of health and happiness. Bravo.",1387843200,10,477,4.370786516853933

6015461,5,B00FNLUO6G,"Thought this was going to just be a upbeat movie about snowboarders and their shenanigans. It turns out to be one of the best movies I've seen in a while. Deeply moving story about resilience in the face of adversity. I'd almost compare it to the ""Concussion"" (NFL) equivalent for extreme sports.",1502668800,,296,4.711538461538462

6015464,5,B00FNLUO6G,oh boy. if you want to understand more about brain injured people this is the one to watch. without his mother Kevin Pearce would've had a second tbi. his family really put themselves out there in order to tell Kevin's story. this movie is his contribution to improving the world by reducing the number of tbis and 2nd tbi. rough stuff. brother David plays a pivotal role. lots of great snowboarding.,1499212800,,400,4.647887323943662
6015465,5,B00FNLUO6G,Best accidental click I've ever done! This is an eye opener,1497830400,,59,4.454545454545454
6015466,5,B00FNLUO6G,"The Crash Reel is a surprisingly moving documentary about a gifted young athlete and his remarkable family. The trajectory of Kevin Pearce's young life is presented in full, from hyperactive toddler to teenage champion snowboarder to survivor of a horrific snowboarding accident to a slowly evolving adult coming to terms with the painful reality that he will have to remake his identity from scratch.

While the film stays mainly on the topic of Kevin's accident and recovery, filmmaker Lucy Walker also addresses an important ethical issue. The gifted but adrenalin-addicted young athletes who excel at this dangerous sport have made a pact with the devil in a very real sense, opting for large endorsement deals from cynical sponsors who do not provide them with health insurance. When a catastrophic accident puts a snowboarder in the hospital for six months or a year, their family can easily be bankrupted by the medical bills. Like Roman gladiators, these athletes are engaged in a blood sport in which the masses cheer for the victor while simultaneously waiting for the crash. Because the sport is unregulated, the pipes get higher and higher and the risks along with them.  A crash helmet will sometimes, but not always, save athletes' lives if they make an error and slam into the ground face-first from 40 feet in the air while going 30 miles an hour, as happened to Pearce. We're shown graphically that the ones who survive are often paralyzed and so mentally disabled as the result of traumatic brain injury that they will never live independently again.  If I lived in a snowy state and my kid showed an aptitude for snowboarding, I'd move the family to Florida. I'll take surfing in shark-invested waters any day over this crazy sport.

As a sports documentary, the Crash Reel is loaded with amazing footage of athletes in action. But the scenes with Kevin's family are the heart and soul of the movie. Coming from a very dysfunctional family, I'm filled with a mixture of disbelief and envy when I see parents who have raised their children through example to selflessly love, care for, and communicate with one another.

Lucy Walker took what could easily have been a sensationalistic story and instead opened a thoughtful window into a subculture where some young people become superstars who win gold medals, some lose their lives, and others are transformed through suffering in ways they never imagined. Indeed, the ones left standing at the end of the day may not even be the best in the field, just the luckiest.",1493942400,,2536,4.91588785046729

6015469,5,B00FNLUO6G,"I'm really happy I spent the time to watch this movie. I was impressed with the real-life footage of the accident, the aftermath in the hospital, and the following years of rehabilitation and how heavily it weighed on the entire Pearce family. This is a beautiful family with issues other than a brain-injured son -- one with Down Syndrome and father with dyslexia. The mother is strong, articulate, fiercely protective of her sons, and so supportive of their life challenges. It's no wonder that this kid came back from the brink of death. I definitely recommend this film to everyone -- adults, kids, and especially to those who are involved in high risk sports.",1491523200,3,664,4.833333333333333

6015478,5,B00FNLUO6G,"I had never watched competitive snowboarding before watching this documentary. I was amazed at the magnificence--the near poetry--of the acrobatics, the extremely demanding precision required to perform them, and the equally extreme degree of danger involved. Kevin Pearce was at the top. And then the accident happened. I was very impressed with the concern and support he received from his parents and brothers for over three years of rehabilitation from his brain injury. David Pierce, his brother with Down's syndrome, showed as much love and wisdom in making meaningful comparisons with his own affliction as anyone.

I was relieved that 3 1/2 years after the accident Kevin accepted that he is no more who he was before the TBI and never will be. He is showing a lot of maturity--as well as revealing the superb quality of parenting and doctoring he has been receiving. A truly unique documentary, with important lessons for most of us.",1482624000,5,942,5.077419354838709

I hope this will bring more awareness to the struggles that are faced daily by those who have a TBI and impart knowledge, compassion and understanding. Programs that actually help individuals to be as self supporting as possible are unfortunately non existent at least in my area. With increased awareness maybe that will change.

6015523,5,B00FNLUO6G,"As a neuropsychologist, I really appreciated that this film showed the good, the bad, and the ugly. As our society tends to idealize and find interest in extreme sports and bad crashes (e.g. Ridiculousness), it's important for the public to know how devastating these types of injuries can be to the patient as well as their families. I don't mean that we laugh when someone gets hurt, just that we enjoy watching crashes (like a train wreck, can't look away). The Crash Reel shows what happens after the crash, and the years it takes to come back from such an injury if one can. This documentary is special in that it shows the moment of impact since they were filming Kevin's practice, pictures immediately post-fall, and everything after (e.g. Hospitalization, rehab, neuropsychological and vision evaluations, and frank conversations with and commentary by Kevin's family). The honesty with which this film was made makes it both poignant and painful to watch. I've now seen this film several times and would highly recommend it. It's a cautionary tale for a society too focused on bigger, riskier, and more exciting sports at the expense of our athletes. We all like to watch, so movies like The Crash Reel are important reminders of why bigger tricks aren't necessarily better.",1431216000,15,1283,4.972093023255814

I've moved from not being a fan to actively opposing the sponsorship of these mindless invitations to destroy young lives in interests of gladiator-style entertainment for the masses.

Here is a video of me seeing three of my (10) kids for the first time after months at Craig Hospital  https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B1GqSkX35weJOEtESkJId3BJWlE/preview

I got the same physical issues like you got by being on my daily bicycling on a Saturday and about a few miles to the end of the course and I fell off my bicycling.  I was doing about 30 mph on the street  and I hit the road with my head and body.  I was in the hospitol in Kansas City for a little over a month.  Then they put me in Craig Hospital to get more help.  I was there until late August when I was doing great and was allowed to go home back in Kansas City Mo.

I watched  ""The Crash Reel"" for the first time and it really hooked with me and all that I had been through.  I'm sorry you had to have the same thing I had but I'm very happy we survived and your life got back to you and you got a lot smarter about your issue.

Kevin's brother David's storyline is also brilliantly and honestly told, and one of the main reasons I wanted to own the movie.

Beyond the Pearces, Kevin's exploration of brain injury survivors and non-survivors provides an important education for everyone - not just extreme athletes.

6015553,5,B00FNLUO6G,"This movie's foundation is most definitely Snowboarding. However, the story and main concept/issue is brain trauma - or as Kevin Pearce puts it, ""brain injured.""  This documentary is a very important film to watch.  Notice, I do not use the term ""interesting,"" ""inspiring,"" or ""enlightening"" [to name a few accurate adjectives.] This is because above all else, it is important for anyone in an extreme sport to see the consequences of a bad head injury; not so much to scare one away from their passion, but to respect the dangers and use preventative cautions when adrenaline and excitement can overcome us.

Forget the fact that you're not a snowboarder with this documentary.  Skier's, mountain biker's, skateboarders, snowmobiler's, and any other extreme sporters - YOU OWE IT TO YOURSELF AND YOUR LOVED ONE'S TO WATCH THIS AND PLAY SAFELY.

I did find on a random website but was not comfortable buying from that site so have been searching Amazon ever since. Today I found it finally and ordered it!  I am an adrenaline junkie also and dealt with my own T.B.I. and can not ride as hard I use too. I would personally like to see this shown in schools or community centers to spread the knowledge about how quickly this can happen and the effects it has on everyone close to the person who suffers with their brain injury.

As the mom of a child that suffered a TBI from an illness when he was 5, we followed Kevin's story praying for them every step of the way. I couldn't wait to see this movie and share it with my now 13 year old son who is still too remediating. It did not disappoint, simply amazing. I appreciated how it showed how driven Kevin was and what fueled him to do so, even if that didn't show Shaun White in the most flattering manner. Without seeing how driven he was you could never understand how he wanted to go back. The family was amazing to be so scared for him and to still allow him to get where he is with love, warning, fear and support all at the same time. Personally, parts of it were tough since we recognized EVERY test, tool and even had the same eye surgery. I think EVERYONE should watch this, it shows the power of love, support and being a good person and friend.",1392681600,,995,4.1875

6015588,4,B00FNLUO6G,"As a fan of extreme sports I was stunned to finally have it all put out in front of me the rate of traumatic brain and body injuries and deaths. It also dusts the mindset of why people get hooked on these sports despite the injury rate. The Pearce family was frank, open and easy to admire. I took one star away because I was confused as to why there had to be a subplot that trashed Shaun White - it was jarring to me when the main plot was so absorbing and thought provoking. It almost seemed like two unmatched plots; or a payback to White who is obviously not well liked. This is well worth watching and should spark some conversation about how far these sports are going to be allowed to go for us to have some entertainment.",1392422400,12,730,4.184397163120567
6015589,5,B00FNLUO6G,Kevin Pearce was at the top of his game when a training crash in 2009 derailed his plan to challenge Shaun White at the 2010 Olympics.  The Crash Reel chronicles Kevin's rise to the pinnacle of competitive snowboarding and his family's struggle as he worked his way back from a traumatic brain injury. Intimate footage of family discussions around the dinner table as Kevin contemplates snowboarding again is heart-wrenching.  I watched the Olympic snowboarders with a whole new perspective after watching this film.,1392336000,,516,5.204819277108434

I respect Shaun White too.  Whatever happened between the two can be at least partially be attributed to age, I wouldn't want to be judged forever on things I did at their age!  Anyway, the real story here is Kevin and his remarkable talent, recovery and his strength and tenacity in the face of the challenges created by his injury.  I would say no matter who you are, there is no way to not like this movie.",1391904000,,578,4.079646017699115
6015591,5,B00FNLUO6G,"This is not a regular sports documentary. Instead, this is a remarkable story of a young man who had it all (good looking, world class talent, medals, money, etc.) when his world was turned upside down after a brutal crash on his head (which is also filmed). What follows is for me something to write my first Amazon review for.

The young man wakes up from his coma, to realize that his brain is just not functioning like it should be and like it used to be. What came as a surprise to me, was that he insisted on coming back in his dangerous sport, despite all the warnings from doctors and advise from his loving family. He just could not accept his disablement. The director of this great documentary then brings you inside this wonderful family, and you can watch how they struggle with Kevin's decision to enter the sport again. Then eventually, to see his emotional turnaround, when he finally accepts that he is just not the young man who he used to be and that he must give his life new meaning, was for me as a psychologist just superb television.

I am from a small town called Volendam, which is in The Netherlands. In 2001, there was a brutal fire in our village. It was in a bar full of young people. 14 young boys and girls died, and more than 100 were heavily burned. What I saw after this event, was that the young people all responded differently to their 'new' face and body, and their inability to physically live the life they were used to. Some of them never made the turnaround mentally, and were unable to focus on the positive and give meaning to their life.

I now strongly recommend this documentary to these people, and also to other people who somehow find themselves in a situation which they can't change, just to let them realize that they DO have the control over their future, and how they find the strength to focus on the things they are still able to do. Which, in the case of Kevin Pearce, is more than he would have ever dreamed.

Full 5 stars!",1391817600,2,1983,4.395095367847412

I truly miss him being in the sport and was very interested in his recovery. This details his successful snowboarding career and also his rocky recovery. His emotions are on display when it comes to dealing with his injury. The most amazing part is his loving family and how they dealt with his injury. The soundtrack matches the mood of the film perfectly and the many vivid images of the sport bring Kevin's world to life.,1391126400,,601,4.280701754385965

My husband has a TBI and was recommended to check it out, and we did but man it took 30 minutes before they even started talking about KP's actual injury, rehab, etc. - and then they never got into what he did with creating the Love Your Brain foundation and all the yoga related to it! Kind of befuddled with that as it seemed to be more of a highlight reel for his pre-TBI life for much of it. What they DID cover in relation to TBI was fantastic and my husband really was happy to identify with someone else, even if KP is much younger.",1518998400,,567,4.163636363636364
