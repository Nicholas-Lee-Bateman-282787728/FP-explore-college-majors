7861276,5,6304097123,"This movie was originally broadcast on NBC television as a two night, 4 hour miniseries (with commercials) many years ago.  This is the best acting I have ever seen Christopher Reeve ever do.  Anthony Denison was also excellent.  It tells the true story of how the British with the help of few American went after the Germans who murdered 50 Allied soldiers who escaped from the P.O.W. camp Stalag Luft III.  In many aspects this movie is better than the original movie since it shows what happened to the murdered men and how evil the people were who murdered them.  In the end, the guilty parties were hanged or shot.  I wish this would come out on DVD because I would buy it in an instant.  If you liked the original movie, you have to see the second movie.",1338422400,2,760,4.424460431654676
7861277,1,6304097123,"If you've already seen the original GREAT ESCAPE, then you shouldn't waste your time with this. GREAT ESCAPE 2 is supposedly closer to the real events, but that's still no excuse to bore the living daylights out of viewers. Here we have Christopher Reeve, Judd Hirsch (TV's TAXI) and Donald PLeasance as very poor stand ins for Steve McQueen, James Coburn and Charles Bronson. Probably part of this is that I slogged my way through the three hour version, each 90 minute part has a different director which probably didn't help matters. Part 1 is directed by Paul Wendkos and Part 2 by Jud Taylor. If you absolutely must watch this then try and find the 90 minute edited version. Don't torture yourself like I did. Maybe part of the claustrophobia of Bronson's character in the original may have been the prophecy that this movie would be green-lighted 25 years later.",1041033600,3,868,4.754966887417218
