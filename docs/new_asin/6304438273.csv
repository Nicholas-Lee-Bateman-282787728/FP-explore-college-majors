889349,3,6304438273,"Good story but leaves out lots from case
 Do your own research For real facts on the case. Ok now Ive watched this one a couple times after reading, listening and watching from other sources / facts on the case. 2nd time watching this I paid closer attention to the defense side. Just listen to what they say and how they talk, and what they say. Doesnt seem to be any sympathy whatsoever from The defenses side, for the grieving family of the three working class families of the three little boys that were murdered. When the defense Attorney asks Accused if he thinks Damien did it, their was a long pause. When Girlfriend is asked, she laughs like an immature school girl. Educate yourself on the backgrounds, rap sheets and mental health histories of the three that were convicted (and their families). This defense media tool got people to believe they were innocent, by poking holes in the prosecutions case, and blaming the stepfathers ( who searched frantically, all night for their step kids), and any other person they could find, to get The Defendant out of the death penalty. Yes the teenage boys were young, but if they didn't do it, they should be finding who really did it to exonerate themselves & to clear their names. To me, it seems like they want everyone else to do it for them. The celebrities raised all this money for their defense / release, they could raise some more money for the victims families, to find out who really did it, if you don't think the WM3 are guilty. I feel so bad for the families of the 3 little boys. I don't see any true sympathy from the accused/ guilty sides families at all when. I watched this.  They laugh when recalling / talking about the cops/ coming to arrest them and how they hid in the back room. Sad Sad Sad story all around. I hope and pray the families get closure one of these days. They should do Netflix making a Murderer on this case, and see if any new revelations and facts come up. The backgrounds of the three accused that we don't see in these documentaries would be quite interesting.",1509667200,2,2058,4.485333333333333

889353,4,6304438273,"Well made documentary.

889354,5,6304438273,"Hard to say you love this, but that is because you are given both/all points of view, which is rare in a single movie/episode. a terrifying case of reality, wrong doing, gross negligence and terrible investigative methods. Even if the interrogation methods used are normal, which I believe they are, and often lead to real results, this case is different. It is a perfect example of the negative aspects of detectivism that leads to both false confessions and the locking up of innocent young and/or mentally handicapped subjects. No matter what you believe in the beginning,  all truth becomes obscured by the reality forced upon these individuals by the courts. I believe honestly if they were retied today, there would not be enough evidence to convict a single soul in question. It seems to be an obvious case of ""Get it solved, NOW!!"" disregarding both evidence, witnesses and conscience regard of truth, in order to make the public feel at ease. It honestly seems as though they took the easy way out. they kids who ""dress in dark clothing and listen to different music. They must be evil!!! Simply because they look, dress and act and ARE different than the town of never ending pastor-ism that surrounds them. A true modern day witch hunt in the most extreme. I could be wrong! However, I believe the investigators were lazy, incompetent, self absorbed and pressured to find the answers. I believe they took the fastest, easiest route to their own freedom from the shackles of the case, and put them on the first people/kids they could find in order to serve both their own purpose and to allow the community to feel a false sense of safety and control.",1501286400,2,1661,4.767361111111111
889405,4,6304438273,"I've just recently begun following this case after viewing Devil's Knot. I never believed the three young men committed the murders. From what I viewed and read, I believe one of or both of the stepfathers were the murderers. For some reason, the local police botched this case up. Right from the beginning they hadn't a clue as to what they were doing and that was shown more than once. From not checking out the disoriented black man in the woman's restroom at Bojangles, to losing evidence to not following up the on the stepfather with the boy's blood on his knife. The black man could have been the killer, or he could have witnessed the murders. Why no followup to this? Why was the blood sample lost? Evidently, the police were overwhelmed by the extent of the case and should have brought in help. Coincidentally, the police were under investigation by the Arkansas State Police, which probably was why they didn't ask for their help even when offered.
Sad, how this case was handled. However, I didn't appreciate the way this documentary slants toward the innocence of the young men. Though, I don't believe the three young men committed the murders, I do believe they had something to do with it. Fact: One of the young man testified on more than one occasion that they did it, and contrary to what Jesse Muskelley supportors want you to believe, he isn't that stupid. Watch him: He isn't stupid nor does he behave as if he is a fourth grader. Damein Nichols behaves too calm, cool and collected.
Interesting documentary if you don't mind the slant toward proving the accused young men are innocent. No one will ever know what truly happened except for the dead boys and the murderers themselves.",1501200000,2,1706,4.69

The documentary is very thought provoking, and definitely brings out emotions regarding whether the 3 were innocent, or guilty.

Baldwin, I can't believe they sent him to jail. he can't even manage 2 words at the same time let alone kill someone. classic case of just following along. Too bad because he followed Echols all the way to hell. I still don't think they should send him to jail for more than 20yrs. He was just stupid follower, that's all.
I think the 1st one was advised to confess for something he didn't know about. They probably told him he'll have better chance that way. How could he not know that they didn't kill them at noon? after school? etc.
How on earth did the court find them guilty when he couldn't even give these basic info?

Taking into account hollywood loves murders, rapists and thieves, while detesting white Southern Christians, their attempts to portray these three as innocent fell short. Even though I would hate to have been on that jury, I am unconvinced they were incorrect in their verdict.

Like to see teenage child murderers glorified as outsiders railroaded by a bigoted and corrupt judicial system? Then this movie is for you. Don't expect to see the facts of the case - like none of the three have alibis. Two out of the three failed a lie detector test. The ""coerced"" confessions was just one of many taped confessions that Jessie Misskelley made most after he was convicted. Once with his hand on a Bible and the other with his lawyer begging him not to confess and pleading with him that his appeal would be made difficult. You can hear many of these taped confessions on YouTube but not in one of the three long ""documentaries"" that are more love letter to the killers than truthful record. When asked by the police who killed the boys Damien Echols replied ""satanists"". So if there was any ""satanic panic"" it was introduced by Echols himself. You can find the truth about this case by reading the case files and court documents at [...] or by reading William Ramsey's excellent book Abomination. Don't think your seeing anything but a money grab on the part of the filmmakers who sacrificed truth for a suspenseful who done it documentary.

When the truth started coming out with Michael Moore docs (Bowling, 9/11, etc.), I could no longer just accept the film at face value.  As entertaining as his movies are, they're mostly fiction, as he edits out and edits in the scenes necessary to validate his politics.  The same holds true for Making a Murderer, and of course, the Paradise Lost trilogy.  All three docs are very entertaining, but mostly misleading, and in some cases, downright false.  The producers clearly had an agenda to portray the WM3 as innocent; its obvious if anyone digs just a little into the Callahan. 8k website.  Theres so much information that proves without a doubt that Damien, Jason and Jessie did it.  No need to rehash the whole case here, as this is a movie review.

Makes you question the justice system. Lady Justice is supposed to wear a blindfold, not horse blinders (blinkers is their actual term) to give them a discriminative tunnel vision. Sometimes I believe there should be term limits or required classes for detectives in law enforcement as there are many who lose sight of detecting and just turn to railroading. As screwed up as these boys may have seemed, it was their duty to the victims and these lost kids, that law enforcement is given to protect them. Guilty beyond a reasonable doubt is the measure meant to be used, not guilty due to wanton discrimination. Yes these boys weren't angels, but on the same note, they were not the demon spawn who slaughtered those poor 8 year old boys either.

Its amazing how much forensics and the legal system has changed since 1993 however.  Who goes around assuming or accusing people of murder b/c they do not fit in.

The question of the knife being sent and accepted by the filmmakers and then turned over to police feels undeveloped and somewhat shady.  Why didn't the filmmakers want to interview themselves on this situation that they found themselves in?  This whole thing made them part of the story now--in a very provocative way.  You know, if you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.  I found the film a good companion piece to the book, though, ""Devil's Knot,"" which seems to go much, much deeper into he story.  While the film was very good and it brought all the players and events into view, it doesn't go very much beneath the surface of this controversial murder case.  My big question: why didn't the defendants at any point just jump up and just scream, ""We are innocent...we didn't do this!""  It's a good question, no?

I feel like the one kid was railroaded because it seemed as though he clearly had a mental disability and I am not even sure of the other two children.  I guess I assumed because it had such a title that it would be a more thematic film with a moral to the story and not a documentary of sorts.  It was weird.

890426,5,6304438273,"Generally, I tend to dismiss HBO docs as piles of liberal tripe. This case and the production of this documentary, however, is powerfully compelling. The filmmakers see a story to tell, and despite the sensationalistic coverage going on about them, they manage to tell it from both sides.

 I'm one of those people who tend more to LISTEN to a film as a secondary form of entertainment while I do other things: seldom able to sit down to simply watch a movie. I had run these films on HBO during a bit of spring cleaning, and promised myself that I'd give more attention to them when my busy, multitasking life caught a break. Now, in the re-screening, I caught a great deal that I'd missed the first time(s).

It's hard to picture potential killers as boys, or even boys as potential killers. Seeing their expressions as the case unfolds and watching as the antics outside the courthouse become more circus-like (trust me: the next two films will reflect this as a grossly understated term),  casts more than a shadow of ""reasonable"" doubt on their guilt. This end of Memphis; its law enforcement, and judiciary seemed awfully afraid of certain truths which might have indicate not only a grossly mismanaged investigation, but the potential lynching of three innocent boys to assuage panic and further political careers. In the telling of this film, we're forced to confront the possibility that there was likely more motive on the prosecution's side than in the minds of three teenagers living on the fringe of social acceptance. IN this regard, the documentarians force us to confront questions that lead to a more earnest assessment of what we might do if it were us sitting in that juror's box. That said? Even knowing how this shakes out, I'd still like to b*tch slap that Byers dude and his seemingly equally in-bred wife, each of whom I'm convinced made a little too much obvious noise, and whom I found immensely irritating in general. What kind of mother lets her son live with a lunatic like this? You'll have to see the rest of the story (read: ""circus"") to find out. ;)",1433030400,,2082,4.7272727272727275

890428,4,6304438273,"Good documentary, but I still feel like these men are guilty. Do your own research, because this doc is very biased toward the defense. Look up exhibit 500 which talks extensively about Echols mental health problems, find out about the Evan Williams whisky bottle which Miskelley told them about breaking when he and the others went into the woods. They went and found it in the same spot he said it would be. Miskelley confessed another 4 times even after he was convicted. Go to westmemphisthreetruth.com and westmemphisthreefacts.com.  Also I think that the last part where Echols says that he's actually happy, I believe that's what he said, because now he would be remembered for the rest of his life and the young kids  would call him the West Memphis boogey man. I think it's very telling. That is very very telling of what Echols has his mind on. That is classic sociopathic, narcissistic talk. Very scary. That last part alone should have been left out since they were trying to paint these boys as innocent. I heard the last two Paradise Losts are even worse than this on being bias.

890475,5,6304438273,"The WM3 (West Memphis Three) trilogy is a MUST for anyone wanting to look at the madness and insanity of our legal system in the United States.  There are so many examples out there; but, not many that we get so much visible access to, with such grandiosity on the part of so many players (there are so many stranger than fiction moments, it will almost make you violently ill). The saddest part of this film/case is that not just three teen boys were thrown away into a prison system that let them rot, for no reason; but, that in reality, six boys were thrown away, as the little boys who were murdered will never see justice! If you haven't followed this story (or seen the film - even though I'm saying these things, this doesn't matter, it's not a spoiler), these tragedies became EPIC (and in my mind continue to be), because of the complete and utter incompetency of the ""system"" who let ALL SIX of these boys down in the worst way.

It truly brings anger to my heart, tears to my eyes, and literally makes me feel ill inside. It makes me wonder, how could this happen? And, if this type of thing isn't something that makes you go, hmmm, about the death penalty... what does? On many an occasion, there were almost FOUR dead boys here, as they nearly executed one of these innocent kids in prison, many times.

By all means, if you have the time, and the stomach, and the brave heart, to sit through all three of these documentaries, you'll walk away with more questions than answers; and probably a lot of anger and confusion. I still get upset; even with the outcome (no spoiler on that). I am the very same age as these guys. I often ask myself... could this have been me? Someone I love? My best friend? Who else is this happening to right this minute? And... it reminds me of other documentaries I highly recommend that will all of us to question some of our mindsets as well; are we in a same stuff, different day kind of world? Is this ok, letting it go on? I'll list the other documentaries that go with this film, below, but Amazon won't lt me submit them with links. All of them are on PRIME, so they're easy to find.

First, check out the other two documentaries that follow the original Paradise Lost, in this order:
Paradise Lost 2
Paradise Lost: Purgatory

Then when you can stomach it, check out these other two racist monsters that are pretty much the same story, different dance (what is wrong with our system??)
The Central Park Five (by Ken Burns)
Murder on a Sunday Morning

Last, if you can ever find it anywhere, nearly impossible to stream it online, but MAYBE on YouTube or elsewhere... is THE STAIRCASE. I've seen it for sale on Amazon pretty cheap - it was on IFC, and is a DVD set (TWO discs - so if you pick it up, you have to get both). Also another fascinating, up-close look at our system with lots of inside access to the defense team, the accused, and even the prosecution for part of the film. It is quite long, but broken into segments. Very powerful, and another ""stranger than fiction"" type of story. Did he, or didn't he? There's so many twists you'll never predict... but the one underlying thing going on with this film, totally unlike the others, is that it's not about a ""kid in poverty"" it's a rich man - but can HE still get justice, as well?

Anyways, the Paradise Lost series is a must. Troubling, A+ work. And, I truly believe that without these documentaries, the persistent pushing and researching, and fundraising of the folks who helped keep the story of these boys alive, well, they wouldn't still be alive and with us as we speak.

890479,5,6304438273,"I feel sort of silly because I hadnt really heard of this story. I vaguely remember something about it years ago but I guess I didn't really pay attention. Anyway, this is one of the best documentaries Ive ever seen. I don't feel like it was truly biased; it shows the trial from all angles, the grief and horror of the parents of the victims and then the truly awful miscarriage of justice of the three accused boys. I've only watched the first documentary and I don't know the further evidences of the case but after seeing this, I'm inclined to think that these three teenagers did not commit this crime. I do feel as if they were judged by their behaviors and appearances and it's a common case of stereotyping not only ""goth kids"" but white trash people in general. I'm glad the documentary does NOT do that. Everyone here from the lowest scum to the most injured people involved, everybody is treated with dignity and respect. I honestly think that what the police and investigators did in reference to the Miskelley Jr. boy was REALLY disgusting. The unconditional love his father shows him particularly moved me and made me cry.
It was pretty easy to tell that the documentarians had an innocent angle from the jump as the satanism and occult issues are handled with a sense of scoffing. It bothers me really badly that grown up adult professional people in law enforcement and within the criminal justice system could receive these really stupid basic evidences (library books, for God's sake) and whip that into some satanic mumbo jumbo. I'm also not sure how the jury did not hear what the defense attorney was asking. It basically summed up the whole case! But I guess it was a hotbed topic at that time and maybe they were tainted because I really don't see how they came to their verdicts with almost zero evidence? It's really tragic. But, all I can say is, if you're interested in true crime or the judicial system ---you must watch Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills. Its terrifying for multiple reasons and excellently made. Would make a claim that this should be watched by adults as it contains severely disturbing graphic crime photos and details/discussions of a heinous murder of little boys.

As I watched this film, I couldn't believe what I was watching.  Early on, I thought the three boys were guilty, then again, as I watched the trial unfold; heard testimony and real-time media coverage that was in this documentary; and extreme anger from the victim's families, I began to feel the accused boys were becoming victims themselves!  Basically, this trial was a travesty. (Watch for yourself).  I only hope that if I'm ever accused of a crime, and I'm innocent, by god don't trust the police who are under pressure to get a conviction, and have one hell of an attorney.  These boys got screwed.  I can't wait to watch the sequels to see how the retrials and appeals turned out for these 3 accused killers.

890704,5,6304438273,"""innocent until proven guilty."" these are beautiful words belonging to civilized societies, and yet these words are also casually cast aside once emotions arise in the wake of violent crimes. the ""paradise lost"" documentaries present the case of the ""west memphis three,"" a case that's been driven by christian fears of the occult and of heavy metal music. this episode of the miscarriage of justice is extremely compelling and intriguing, and should be considered mandatory viewing for all citizens who might some day serve on a jury.

in the quiet town of west memphis, arkansas, three young boys were found brutally tortured and murdered in 1993 with almost no evidence left at the crime scene. after a high profile investigation with no progress, the local police finally arrested three teenagers who would later be known as the west memphis three: damien echols, jason baldwin, and jessie misskelley, jr. the three outsiders wore black clothing, listened to heavy metal music, read unpopular books, and consequently their behavior was considered strange by the community around them. this was enough to get much of the community up in arms against the west memphis three before the trial even began.

what really struck me about this case was the sheer poverty of evidence here. the only real piece of evidence was misskelley's taped confession; everything else was circumstantial and shaky at best. misskelley had a low iq of 72, was questioned by the police for about 12 hours without a lawyer present, and then had his confession taped at the very end of that interrogation after professing his innocence for most of that time. the confession tape clearly showed the police's questions were leading misskelley to say what the police wanted. misskelley confessed to aiding in the murder of the three young victims during the daytime only to have the police turn around and suggest the murders were at night. after that suggestion, misskelley changed his confession to suit the police's story. misskelley also got other details about the crime incorrect in his ""confession."" these inconsistencies suggest that misskelley confessed only because he just wanted to go home after 12 hours of relentless interrogation and was willing to just agree with whatever the police wanted him to say. i couldn't believe the jurors in arkansas not only convicted the west memphis three, but even sentenced one of them to death on such scanty evidence. certainly there was ample reasonable doubt here.

religion had a large part to play in the jurors' decisions. in the aftermath of the crime, the mostly christian community was wrapped up in hysteria about satanic cults. they saw the devil's work in these three teenage outsiders and simply had no more room for reason and logic. watch ""paradise lost"" and see the sheer level of hate and vitriolic punishments some of these so-called christians had in mind for the west memphis three before guilt was even determined by the law. the masses could just peer into the eyes and souls of the west memphis three and they just knew the accused were guilty! the religious insanity even bled into the court proceedings, with the prosecution asking questions about damien echol's name, asking whether it was satanic in origin as influenced by dark hollywood movies (""the omen""). it is absurd and downright embarrassing for this to happen in a modern court of justice.

the west memphis three were robbed of much of their time on this earth because they happened to live amongst paranoid, irrational, emotional people who allow religion to get the better of rationality. it frightens me to know such people are deciding the fates of accused parties in courtrooms every day, especially if the death penalty is an option. if you happen to live in such a community, watch this documentary series and then consider moving somewhere more civilized.",1408492800,22,3874,5.0390015600624025

Half of the film was tolerable in its account of the facts. However I feel that many of the film's participants got a little taste of fame and took it to the extreme. It's sad in a way that the people of West Memphis would now have to live with the ripples that this doc. may cause.

891074,4,6304438273,"The story, for those unfamiliar with the famous case of the West Memphis Three, is simple and uniquely complex.  Three 8 year old boys were found bound, naked and dead in a drainage ditch in West Memphis Arkansas on May 7, 1993. This film is not for the faint hearted as there is footage of the dead children beside the ditch and it is gruesome. There was no blood found at the scene, however, making it unlikely that the murders were committed where the bodies were found.  The following day, the police picked up an 18 year old high school dropout, Damien Echols, brought him in for questioning and continued to question him periodically for several weeks.  Echols repeatedly denied any involvement in the crime and said he knew only what he saw on television and what he had learned from the police themselves.

 Eventually, a few weeks after the bodies were discovered, the police brought in a 17 year old with an I.Q. between 72 and 84, depending on the source, Jessie Misskelley.  Jessie confessed to the crime, claiming Echols and another friend, Jason Baldwin,16 at the time of his arrest, were also guilty.  Misskelley later claimed the confession was coerced and recanted.

Although there was no physical evidence connecting the three to the crime, they were convicted of first degree murder, with Jessie and Jason given life sentences and Damien Echols, the alleged ringleader, getting the death penalty.  The movie makes it clear that the lack of physical evidence apparently was lost of the jurors, who convicted the three without much debate.

All three came from poor families and, although Echols had some psychological issues, neither he nor Baldwin had any prior arrests for violent behavior.  The three liked heavy metal music and Echols had a penchant for wearing black so the case was built around the assumption that the three were members of a satanic cult and it was ""murder by cult activity.""  The convictions were based on hearsay evidence, dubious testimony from an expert in ""the occult,"" and innuendo rather than any proof.

 Paradise Lost I and II paint bewildering portraits in which neither the police, the attorneys, the witnesses, the defendants themselves, nor even the families of the murdered children, are sympathetic.  Particularly creepy was the stepfather of one of the murdered children, Christopher Byers, who spent a good deal of time posing for the filmmakers, eventually showing them a folding hunting knife which he claimed never to have used, but which was later found to have blood inside the handle which supposedly matched both his own and that of his stepson.

The first two episodes of Paradise Lost generated a great deal of support for the three and, eventually, a third segment was released and anyone reading this is probably aware that the 3 were released from prison after 18 years without the State of Arkansas actually clearing them of the crime.  Echols kept journals while incarcerated and those have been published into a book: Life After Death, which is exceptional given the circumstances under which it was written.  While in jail, Echols married a woman who devoted much of her adult life to obtaining his release and the two produced a movie, West of Memphis,  backed by Peter Jackson of Hobbit fame, which was released in December, 2012 but has yet to make it to smaller cities as of this writing.",1359849600,7,3367,4.89612676056338

891076,4,6304438273,"Powerful and thought provoking look at American justice, and how we
treat those who are outsiders or 'different'.

When three very young boys are found brutally murdered, and mutilated,
the town of West Memphis demands retribution and closure.  So, after
some fruitless weeks of police work, the suspects become three outsider
teen-age boys, who listened to heavy metal, and the oldest of whom dressed
(somewhat) Goth and was interested in Wicca.

A strong indictment of how, at least some of the time in our justice system
 'guilty until proved innocent' is the rule.

That said, the film makes some serious miss-steps by not being clearer
about some of the evidence it brings up, but never explores. For
example, we're told early on by the filmmakers that all 3 boys had
alibis for the night of the killing, yet we never hear about it again.
Are their defense lawyers THAT bad, or were the alibis not solid? Two
said they were home with their families, yet the families never mention
being with them that night. Similarly, we are never told why the police
picked up the first of the boys, a borderline mentally retarded kid,
who clearly didn't know what was going on, for questioning. The
implication was that the cops wanted an easy pliable target, but the
issue is never explored either by the defense, or by the film-makers.
In a 150 minute movie, there's no need for those kind of loose ends,
leaving us to question whether we've seen a fair reporting of what went
on, or if there really was more evidence against the kids than we're
shown.

Still it's a powerful and important examination of how we often rush to
judgment, socially and legally. Recent history has shown this is far
from an isolated case - people are sent to prison, even death row on
flimsy or incomplete evidence, coerced confessions, and by playing to
society's and a jury's fears and prejudices far more often then we would
all like to believe.",1340409600,2,1921,4.719402985074627
891077,3,6304438273,"Let me state my prejudice at the outset: the story takes place in Arkansas, and the accents grated on my nerves the whole time. But everyone in it had similar accents (although some thicker than others), this did not prejudice me on the main topic. That is, were the so-called West Memphis Three guilty of the horrible murders of three little boys?

Warning: the movie starts with video footage the police shot at the scene, and so you will see the bodies of the victims. However, they could be a whole lot worse, so once you get over the fact that you are seeing actual dead bodies and not some special effects trick of wax or resin, it's not that bad.

Three teenagers were soon arrested, and we follow the case against them from beginning to end. You will have to decide for yourself whether the boys are guilty or not, because even the very end of the movie doesn't make it definite. What you will get is a chilling look at the way the prosecution, the press, the TV news, and just about everyone else in the town simply assumed they were guilty, in large part because one of them was a pagan, interested in Wicca, and they liked the music of Metallica. The other thing is the hard, cold, almost demonic hate the families and neighbors of the victims feel toward the accused long before the trial begins. Also, how the police never followed up any possible leads to any other suspects.

It's very grim, but it's also an important slice of American life.",1336694400,3,1457,4.469924812030075

I wish I could actually see the entire trial and show law students and police officers what not to do.  ( Grisham move over, this is a wild one.)

If you can get past the murder of three young boys, the documentary is a glimpse of how our subjective our conclusions can be.

Why did the prosecution address music (specifically Metallica) during the trial, andwhy didn't the defense object? Is there a causational link between Metallica and murder?  Do many people murder because the listen to Metallica?  Did the victims speak out against Metallica?  IS there even a correlational link to Metallica and murder?  What did murderers listen to before Metallica?  Is there any other band more common amongst murderers?

The same questions can be raised about wearing black.  All of the band members of Metallica wear black.  Is it safe to say they are in an occult and, thus kill?  Billy Joel is a musician who wears black, too.  Every Judge and Priest wears black, but that is part of their work attire.  Does that exclude them?  Why is black the color of choice for murderers?  Why not red?  Red is the color of blood when it is exposed to O2.  Blue is the color of blood in the body.  Why not blue?  If it is occult realted, why not wear colors of your sect or group?

How can there be no evidence at the sceen of the crime?  The defense did mention this in discussion, but I don't know why they did not bring this up in the investigation.  That is more grand jury quetions, but it is important.  Were the kids murdered somewhere else, and if so, did the accused have the ability to transport them?  Was their mode of transprotation researched?  Was there any other evidence at the scene of the crime?  Was there anything on the shoe strings used to tie the knots? They said the blood was washed away, but was there any clothing of the suspects with traces blood?  Why did the killers clean the blood up, take the weapons, but leave the condoms?

The weapon evidence was a joke, too.  Why was a knife at the bottom of a lake considered the weapon?  How long had that knife been in the lake and was it available to be a weapon?  Was there trace blood on that knife?  Was there only one knife used?  What in the world were the police thinking when they dismissed the jack knife? How could the police walk away from a knife with a possible match to one of the victims DNA, and not question the conflicting stories of the owner of that knife?  How could the police and the prosecution ignore the fact that a stepfather owned this knife when majority of the abuses and homicides of a minor are conducted by a family member?

It's important to note, however, that the juries didn't render their verdicts based on the documentary, but on the evidence presented at the trials.

The film concerns the murder and mutilation of three boys in West Memphis, Arkansas, in 1993. Paradise Lost focuses on the trial of the three boys accused of the murders. I came away with many questions about ""what really happened.""

The filmmakers had access to the defendants, the defendants' families, and the families of the murdered boys. One of the defendants has an IQ of only 72. Another is largely inarticulate. The scenes with the families of the murdered boys are particularly intense; each family copes with the murders in a very different manner.

After the murders, a rumor started that the murders were part of a satanic ritual. The publicity and anger surrounding the case were intense. The filmmakers focus on the fact that the defendants were ""white trash"" kids who did not ""fit"" well in West Memphis. Could ""goth"" kids get a fair trial? The prosecutors made much of one defendant's interest in Aleister Crowley and magic.

I think that a few aspects of the film could have been better. We do not learn enough about the defendants. I wanted to know more about what their lives were like before the murders.

891136,5,6304438273,"Documentaries have a strange way about them.  Long before reality TV, people were truly captured in the raw.  Perhaps in no other situation than a true crime will we see people in their starkest form, confronted with situations that they would never face no matter what their value systems, socioeconomic background, religious beliefs, etc.  This was a true horror story unlike anything.

In 1996, three teenage boys were arrested for the brutal murder and mutilation of three second grade boys in a small town in Arkansas.  They were found in creek bed, near an area known for some ""strange things"".  The three teenagers wore heavy metal T shirts, listened to metal music, and were into Satan worship.  They were the subject of a witchhunt, with the whole town after them.

Having watched this, I see this in so many lights.  Perhaps the most horrifying was the fact that we see the videotaped evidence of the children at the creekbed.  Who killed these children and why?  Maybe they saw something they weren't supposed to see, or maybe they were just there at the wrong time.  One of the teenagers relented, after 12 hours of grilling, saying that he and the other two murdered the kids.

Having lived through a lot of this nonsense growning up, I know that all this foolishness about Satanism and black masses and sacrificing virgins is just a bunch of baloney.  Yes, these things have happened in the past, but they have not happened as often as we have been lead to believe that they have.  Most of that is all hype, urban angst and paranoia.  That being said, there are teenagers who (although these days are about 20 years outdated) are trying to make their statements of ""I want attention"" by dressing outlandishly and acting out.  Most of it is about how you dress and what music you listen to.  There is also wicca religion, which is not indicative of Satanism or metal music, but popular opinion says that it's the same.

Jessie is the turncoat, the one who said that the three of them killed the boys.  He has an IQ of 71 and confessed after being held under police pressure for 12 hours.  Taking this into account, despite his low IQ, I think he was telling the truth.  Eventually people cannot keep a secret.  Jason, the second fiddle to the leader, comes off as passive and showing some regret in his blank face.  We see the leader of the three, Damian, as the master of the plan.  He is the boogeyman we are all to fear.  He comes off as being an ""average guy"" type in interviews, but, I don't trust him.  I don't trust him because we are looking at the kinder, gentler Damian and not the man who committed a murder.  We meet about three quarters of the way through the movie his girlfriend and mother of his son, who he will not get to raise as he will be behind bars.  Parenthood changes a person to the point that they are softer and less angry.  Prison life as well has probably made him look at things before as being ridiculous to what he was so angry about.  They were dangerous people before they came under the gun for these murders.

That being said, did one or all of these teenage boys murder these children?  The answer is a resounding YES in my mind.  They would have murdered these children if they were upper class yuppies or trailer trash, which they just happened to be.  Why?  I don't know.  Maybe they did it because they could.

891140,4,6304438273,"Paradise Lost is not an uneventful documentary to say the least. The backdrop is West Memphis during the early to mid 1990s and concerns the disappearance and murder of three children and the sensational media blitz that followed in the wake of the arrest, trial and conviction of two teenagers and one young adult on the bases of a confession that many doubt the authenticity of, the circumstances of the extraction and the low-IQ of the confessor.

What makes this documentary so interesting is the lack of evidence and demonizing of the accused because of how they dress and the music they listen to and how one of them read books about Wicca. The prosecutors present a satanic panic case in order to make up for being short on the proof they need to agree with the confession to create a solid case. In this respect Paradise Lost does not say that the `West Memphis 3' are innocent, or even if justice has been served, but has the case been properly handled. What you mostly see during the trial is that the prosecutors terrify a fundamentalist Christian community with accusations and hearsay of satanic ritual killings accompanied by very dubious evidence to support that view.

The film makers focus on the lives of the families of the accused, the accused and especially the lawyers, but eventually turn their attention to one particular family member of a victim who eventually has to take the stand after blood stains are discovered on his hunting knife. The blood evidence however is inconclusive.

Even though the documentary is very popular, it does have some failings. It doesn't explain everything about the case and sometimes just jumps right into the events as they unfold without explaining how they got there. That is not to say that the documentary doesn't do a job of putting forward a good argument for injustice, but at the same time it's not just a lynching as some viewers may expect given the notoriety this material has in promoting the innocence of the West Memphis 3. There are certain aspects of the accused behavior that don't always add up, on and off the camera. It is really very hard to come away thinking that the West Memphis 3 are completely innocent, but there is enough oddities to warrant further investigation into how this case was handles. To this extent viewers will probably want to also watch Paradise Lost 2 to discover what else has come to light since this documentary brought the attention of the world to what could be a 20th century witch hunt.

891141,3,6304438273,"Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills (Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky, 1996)

It's relatively obvious, after you've gotten an hour or so into Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills that chronicling the case of the ""West Memphis Three"", as they've come to be known, is less a goal of Berlinger and Sinofsky (Brother's Keeper) than making the general populace of West Memphis, Arkansas, look like blithering morons. And in this, they succeed beyond their wildest dreams. Paradise Lost is less a story of a murder and a trial than it is-- and this is the case whether the West Memphis Three are guilty or not-- the devastating power, and stupidity, of mindless prejudice.

The movie opens with the brutal slayings of three second-graders in the backwater town of West Memphis, Arkansas (across the river from Memphis, TN), and the arrest of three teenagers for the crime. The main reason these teenagers were picked up, as far as we can see, is that they don't fit in with the society around them. We are then treated to a host of interviews with the victims' families. Perhaps their pain and rage is understandable. Perhaps you can even identify with their desire for vengeance, and their willingness to express it in the most unintelligent (and often unintelligible) terms. But we get the feeling that these are people who couldn't care less where they vent this vengeance; if the neighbor's pet hamster had been picked up for the crime, they'd be on the phone with Richard Gere, paper towel roll in hand, without needing a shred of evidence other than ""my, that hamster was a different sort, weren't he?"".

Given that, the movie does raise the question of whether, as one of the victims' relatives so eloquently states, our system sucks, though certainly not in the manner they mean. One has to wonder whether sometimes the families of the victims wouldn't be better off put out of their-- and our-- misery. One has to wonder why it is that reproductive-rights advocates believe in reproductive rights at all when people like this have been allowed to breed. One has to wonder whether it's possible for anyone in a place like West Memphis, Arkansas, to get a fair trial if that person doesn't wear a camouflage hunting jacket and have a gun rack in the back of the car window.

This is why I say the trial itself may have been of less interest to the filmmakers; it seems obvious to me that their intent was to raise in the viewer a virulent hatred for the people of West Memphis. They certainly succeeded in my case. And I guess that makes it a good documentary in that it seems to have done what it set out to do. I did wish, however, that I had gotten to see more of the trial itself, kangaroo court though it may have been; it couldn't have raised any more offense and outrage in me than did the scores of interviews with idiots. ***",1198108800,5,2868,4.617647058823529

891184,1,6304438273,"Paradise Lost is an exercise in historical revisionism. Its producers aimed at spinning history with the hope that a trio of clearly guilty murderers would be released. This alleged documentary plays fast and loose with the facts that it presents while leaving inconvenient facts on the cutting room floor to present a false picture of three innocent lads being railroaded for crimes that they did not commit.

Paradise Lost is a dishonest documentary in that while the producers never state their opinions directly, they deliberately omit certain facts while twisting other facts so that they can present a distorted version of what really happened. For instance, the producers want you to believe that the convicted killers were really innocent, that there was no real evidence against them. The makers of this documentary want you to believe that the 3 teenagers were convicted due to their love of heavy metal, the works of Stephen King, the fact they wore black T-shirts and because there was a ""satanic panic"" in the community.

The documentary producers also use John Mark Byers, the stepfather of one of the victims, as a red herring. They insinuate that Byers should have been the top suspect instead of the 3 convicted punks. They conveniently leave out the fact that Byers had an airtight alibi and was cleared of suspicion following an intensive police investigation. This so-called documentary implies that since Byers is mentally slow, then he could have been the real murderer.

Paradise Lost was made along the lines of a Michael Moore documentary sans the comedy. Like a Moore documentary, Paradise Lost shows some of both sides of an issue, but upon further examination, it is clearly one sided. In this case, the bias is on the side of the convicted criminals. Facts that point towards guilt are either glossed over or entirely left out. Contrary to the movie, the trio were not convicted just because they wore black or liked heavy metal music. That is a gross distortion of the evidence against them.

Paradise Lost is one of those documentaries where if you do not know much about the subject, your response likely will be that what happened to the 3 convicts was a horrible miscarriage of justice. However, if you actually know a good deal about what really happened, your reaction is that the documentary itself was nothing but a sham and a fraud.

Paradise Lost is a sham and a fraud that is not worth either your time or your hard earned money. It is most definitely not recommended.",1179273600,27,2509,4.880281690140845

891190,5,6304438273,"This film motivated me to do my own research and I read as much material on the case as I could possibly find--especially arguments from those who maintained that the three teenagers are guilty.  To be honest, I had a natural skepticism about the West Memphis Three's claims of innocence.  A coworker of mine was brutally murdered some years ago and two of her ""friends"" who were also coworkers were arrested for the murder.  I refused to believe it at first.  But it became clear over time that the evidence was overwhelming and conclusive.  Still there were those who refused to believe the facts and zealously argued their friends' innocence.  When all is done and said - it does come down to facts and whether or not one chooses to face reality and believe facts.

First, please allow me to correct a few misconceptions from some of the other reviewers.

The Michael Moore mentioned in the credits refers to one of the little eight-year-old child murder victims, not the filmmaker.

A couple of reviewers mentioned a necklace worn by Damien Echols which supposedly had blood on it from some of the victims. Actually, nothing more determinable than common blood types was found. One almost microscopic spot on the pendant was consistent with the blood type of Damien Echols (one of the accused), the other micro-spot was consistent with the blood type shared by both Jason Baldwin (one of the accused) and Steven Branch (one of the eight-year-old victims) -- as well as 11% of the rest of the Caucasian population of the United States. All experts agree that tiny micro-spots of blood can be transferred by a number of ways--especially a teenage boy wearing the necklace against their bare skin.  Police photos verify that Jason Baldwin had also worn Damien's necklace.  Police photos taken two days after the crime--show Damien without his shirt and reveal absolutely no cuts, abrasions or scratches whatsoever.

The closest thing to credible evidence the prosecution could manage to produce were four very tiny fibers found in the houses of Damien's family and Jason's family which were deemed by the prosecution to be microscopically similar to fibers from two of the victims.  But even the prosecution's expert witness, Lisa Sakevicius a criminologist from the State's Crime Laboratory acknowledged that this was inconclusive and could have just as well come from mass-produced products obtained off the shelves of the local Wal-Mart. Furthermore, Charles Linch of the Southwestern Institute of Forensic Science in Dallas refuted the claims of microscopic similarities in his testimony. No fibers whatsoever were found in the home of Jessie's family.

During the appeal process forensic scientists examining the crime scene photos and autopsy photos identified human bite marks on two of the victims.  This was confirmed by a forensic odontologist.  Teeth impressions were taken from the three young men in prison.  None of these teeth impressions from Damien, Jason and Jessie matched these bite marks found on the victims.

The highly coerced ""confession"" from Jessie Misskelly Jr. (a 17-year-old borderline retarded boy with an IQ of 71) was so filled with obvious errors that it is an obscenity that it was treated as the basis for making these arrest. I should mention that this so-called ""confession"" came after submitting this boy to a 12 hour grueling without lawyers, parents or counsel of any kind and included a polygraph test which he had passed but was told by the police that he had failed. Judge Burnett would not allow the jury to hear about these interrogation techniques.

Jessie Misskelly Jr. refused to testify in court against Jason Baldwin and Damien Echols stating that he simply ""was not going to get up there and tell a bunch of lies"". This was in spite of an offer to remove his life sentence.

Read Dan Stidham's (Jessie's lawyer) case synopsis by copying and pasting the web address below:

[...]

The scenario painted by the police and the prosecutors against the three teenagers is simply a scientific impossibility.  How on earth could there have been the massive blood loss caused by ceremonial satanic cult killings of three persons in the middle of the night without leaving one single micro-speck of blood or any other body fluids at the scene?  Did they sneak in the FBI Forensic Team to clean up after them when nobody was looking?  Luminal testing could reveal blood presence only where the police had laid or transported the bodies. It should also be mentioned that none of the scarce shoe prints at the scene matched Jason, Jessie or Damien either.  .

For a scientific view--see this crime scene analysis and profile by one of America's leading forensic scientist which also gives some insight on who might have actually committed the crime. I must warn you - it is a bit gruesome to say the least:

Copy and paste this web address:

[...]

So let us briefly summarize.  Much of the so-called evidence was based on the notion that Damien admitted an interest in the Wicca religion and the occult which many local people perceived as Satanism.  This is not evidence of committing murder. You can go to any suburban shopping mall bookstore or small town library anywhere in Middle America and find plenty of books on such subjects. Furthermore, neither Jason nor Jessie had ever expressed any particular interest in Wicca or the occult.

Both Damien and Jason wore mostly black clothes and loved heavy metal music.  So what?  The police actually confiscated 15 black T-shirts from Jason's home as evidence to prove God knows what.

Damien was undoubtedly a troubled teenager from a troubled family. He was a bit of a wise-ass teenager.  He wrote some morbid poetry.  So what?

A couple of young girls claimed months after the fact that they had heard Damien say that he committed the murders.  Any reasonable-objective person listening to those testimonies would have found them implausible to put it politely.

A young burglar/drug addict who was in the juvenile detention facility claimed that the shy and reserved 16-year-old  Jason confessed to him the second time they ever met ghastly stories about drinking  blood from the genitals of a murdered child while worshipping the devil. The counselor from that facility warned the prosecution that this young man was not credible and gave them detailed reasons.  And there is no evidence that Jason and this young man ever met.  Even if they did--the story is ridiculous. Still, Judge Burnett would not allow the jury to hear counter-testimony or information that could have challenged the credibility of this witness.

The so-called ""confession"" of Jessie and the scenario put forward by the police and prosecution would have involved massive amounts of blood left at the scene.  There was not even one tiny micro-spec. That is a physical impossibility.

The simple fact is ALL FORENSICS were either exonerating or completely inconclusive.

""There was a lack of physical evidence to tie anyone or anything to the crime scene.""

--John Fogleman, prosecutor of the West Memphis Three--

Sadly, the West Memphis Police would not do anything more than a cursory and disinterested investigation of the most obvious suspect. (See the forensic profile mentioned above) Probably because that obvious suspect who had a violent history including family violence and a lifetime as a penny-anny career criminal was also an undercover narcotic informant who was in a very tight relationship with the West Memphis Police.

Anyway, for God sakes--see this film along with Paradise Lost 2 and read Devils Knot.  .

This is not a political film.  This case has nothing to do with being liberal or conservative, Democrat or Republican, left or right or even whether you support or oppose the death penalty.  I hope that we of all political persuasion agree that locking up the wrong people and letting the real killers get away is a very bad idea.

891260,5,6304438273,"The question at hand in the film Paradise Lost is not as much did these three teenagers commit this heinous act, but rather was there enough evidence to convict them for the murders. The answer, presented by material in the film, is an unflinching no. There was only speculation and rumor to convict the three.

The film's strengths are that it doesn't preach, at least not in an overly wrought narrative, and it contains intimate moments with the accused and their families as well as the families of the victims. I can understand the pain and confusion of the victim's families. What is hard to understand is the bloodlust and need for revenge and retribution that immediately takes hold of them. The victims' families are the most terrifying aspect of this film. At one point the mother of the Byrnes child says in a hateful and spiteful tone ""I hate them... I hate them and the mother's that bore them.""

Is there anything wrong with being hellishly angry with someone who has butchered your child? No, quite natural really. But the point of this film is that judgment was passed on these kids long before the trial even started. I imagine the Bible belt is a very scary place to be raised in... I'll have to ask Brad Pitt what he thinks about it some time.

On the issue of the prosecution. They had next to nothing. A very questionable confession from a terrified kid, Jessie, with a 72 IQ, hearsay from a couple of kids who claim they heard Damien bragging about the murder but have no proof, a knife found behind Damien's house which doesn't match the wounds on the bodies, and the assertion that because Damien read about Wicca, he must be a Satanist.

To look at the three kids is also an interesting aspect of the film. Jessie, a very small and slow kid seems a bit lost in the world. His IQ is low but he has no previous records of any type of behavior that would associate him with murder. Jason speaks in short breathless words and seems also to suffer from a low IQ. Damien is the key to everything in this film though. The defense made the key mistake of letting Damien take the stand for two reasons. The first reason is that Damien appears to have ADD and after the first 10 minutes of questioning he sort of fades away and answers in bland yes and no's. The second reason, and the most important, is that Damien is obviously extremely bright. Normally this wouldn't seem to be a problem but judging from every single person the filmmakers put on camera, smart people are hard to come by in that area of the world. Damien scared them.

All of this adds up to the fact that there was not enough evidence to put these kids away and there were other, more sinister and shocking, suspects that needed to be pursued. The war rages on for the West Memphis Three and it is indeed frightening to think that they did it, and terrifying to think they didn't.",1130976000,5,2866,4.461832061068702
891261,4,6304438273,"This film is a good overview of the case, and primer for the book ""Devil's Knot"" by Mara Leveritt.  It's tough to present the details in the 90 minutes or so that it runs, but it does a pretty darn good job of it.  While the Echols necklace evidence isn't presented in the documentary, it should also be noted that Judge Burnett's incessant denial of every motion made by the defense, while at the same time placating the prosecution at every turn, isn't presented either. It should also be noted, for the benefit of some of the other reviewers, that the blood specimens recovered from the Echols necklace couldn't be analyzed for DNA, only blood type.  One was a blood type match for Damien Echols and the other matched both Jason Baldwin and Steven Branch.  It seems highly implausible that 3 young men, one mentally handicapped, could pull off this horrific crime and only leave secondary fiber transfers and a spot of blood on a necklace, (the blood type of which matched one of the alleged perpetrators and only one of the victims).  If the documentary is biased, it can't begin to counter-balance the bias of the trial judge who would later also serve as the appellate judge.  The documentary is gripping, but at the same time fails to show that the miscarriage of justice was almost entirely the handiwork of an anything but impartial prosecutor in robes named Judge David Burnett.

891262,5,6304438273,"Paradise Lost is definitely one of the most mind-blowingest movies I've ever seen.

Not that it's in my list of all-time favorite films; it's just that this is the kind of film that really knocks you back:  it'll change your mind about a few things and really make you think.  You won't be able to forget it.

Have you ever been in a plane when, just for second, it abruptly loses some altitude, and your stomach seems like it dropped through the floor?  You're gonna feel like that for a couple of days or so after seeing this movie.

Without telling you too much, here's what you need to know:  there has been a murder in rural Arkansas, and some local boys who don't quite fit in (i.e., they have been dressing in black and listening to Metallica) are fingered for it.  The film, a gut-wrenching documentary, follows them through their trial and analyzes the evidence for and against their innocence.  The film is especially recommended if you enjoy documentaries that get into forensic evidence.

I'm sure this happens a lot, but in this particular case the three boys had the good fortune of having HBO make a documentary about the trials while they were happening.  Ever since then, they've had a big following of people who -- while perhaps not saying the three are innocent -- at least insist they were given capital sentences on some rather flimsy evidence.  If you love stories of where the American justice system really goes off the rails -- not in one aspect or incident but systematically -- this film will be hard to match.

But I would like to point out that those baying for the blood of Byers or Hobbs should stop to reflect that, if the tables were somehow turned and THOSE GUYS had wound up in the slammer, in theory the same outrage would obtain:  man locked up on flimsy evidence.  Yet something tells me that, since neither of those guys are Wiccans or listen to Metallica, there wouldn't have been such a brou-ha-ha about a horrendous miscarriage of justice.

What I'm saying is that one's anger should be directed at the justice system, not against those against whom there is still -- even now -- rather slender evidence.  If Byers were thrown in prison on nothing more than what they currently have against him, would you be equally outraged?  I doubt it.

I point this out to suggest that much of the outrage over this case is not actually outrage at the justice system malfunctioning, but rather a way of signalling support for a trio of young goth-dressing misfits.

There was, in addition, a direct-to-video followup film:  Paradise Lost 2:  Revelations.

No connection, incidentally, with the Milton epic.

891267,5,6304438273,"On May 6, 1993 the mutilated bodies of three eight year-old boys were found abandoned along a lonely riverbank on the outskirts of West Memphis, Arkansas. They had been brutally murdered; to this date their killer(or killers have not been brought to justice. Paradise Lost is a startling film about this tragic case, which focuses on the so-called West Memphis Three, Damien Echols, Jason Baldwin and Jessie Misskelly, and the terrible miscarriage of justice that their trials represent.
What happened in this case could be called a modern day Witch hunt that was fueled by paranoia, lurid rumor, wild speculation and rush to judgment that led to the convictions of three innocent youth simply because they happened to be different from those in their community. So while this is also the story of three young boys who were murdered, which is tragic enough in itself, it is also one of three others that are being murdered by a legal system corrupted by ignorance, prejudice and hate.  That there is absolutely no physical evidence of any kind linking any of the three to the murders should be alarming in itself to anyone who has any faith in the American legal system, and considering that the three were convicted solely on the weight of a coerced confession, which was later recanted, these facts should make any reasonable person seriously question what happened here. Not surprisingly, the same police officers who coerced a confession from Jessie Misskelly, a person who also suffers from mild retardation, have totally ignored the possibility of any other suspects and have deliberately destroyed evidence that contradicts the story they concocted. In addition, it is obvious to any observer of the case that even the judge seemed to have a preconceived opinion of the defendant's guilt and decided against them time and time again to ensure their convictions. Am I saying this is some vast police conspiracy carried out to wreck the lives of three young men, whose only crime was being different? No, but what I am saying is that when law enforcement officials adhere to a win at all cost mentality the first victim of such tactics is always truth and after that is dispensed with justice always follows, piling injustice upon injustice, tragedy upon tragedy, while the real murderer or murderers remains free. Doesn't the innocent victims of these heinous crimes deserve better than this? Where is their justice?
What can we really say about our precious freedoms and are great legal code when people who are different from us are still being persecuted for no other reason than their differences, just as they were in Salem in 1691? Is it a crime to listen to Metallica and wear black clothes? Is it a crime to read books written by Anne Rice and Aleister Crowley? Is it a crime to be interested in Wicca? As this case sadly illustrates, in some parts of this country apparently it is, and if new trials or clemency is not granted soon, the penalty for their deviations from the accepted ""norms"" will be death for Damien Echols, while Jessie Misskelly and Jason Baldwin will most likely spend the rest of their lives in prison.

Onto the video. I'd say the main bias I noted was that the documentary had a very apparent goal of making most of the citizens of West Memphis appear as backwoods and backwards as possible. That said, as the investigation and trial procedures come into play, one cannot deny the ignorance and carelessness which led to the fate of the West Memphis Three.
The injustices depicted in this documentary are positively heartbreaking. Even thinking abstractly that the U.S. court system can be corrupt, it is hard to imagine a circus of a case like this existing outside of the world of fiction. It's definitely left an impression on me; I've continued to research the case and simply can't get it out of my mind.

For every individual who has felt ""on the fringe"" of society at one point in his/her life, this movie is for you. Paradise Lost engages the viewer personally, and, as so many others have stated, draws you in like no other film. It is virtually impossible to walk away from Paradise Lost unaffected.

For anyone who does not support the West Memphis Three, because they ""look like killers"" I press you buy this even more. If you don't want to rent the video, I urge you to go to the website and view Saul's Synopsis. See beyond the injustice. Support our rights as humans. The right not to be discriminated against for what we wear, listen to, and believe. And the right to a fair trial. The WM3 were scapegoats for shoddy police officers. See beyond the lies. Free the West Memphis Three. Don't judge.",983836800,5,610,4.3130434782608695

891335,5,6304438273,"This is one of the most amazing movies you will ever see--it draws you into the world of the West Memphis 3 Case, a true story which is not over yet. One young man is on death row & 2 others doing life sentences because of a modern day witch hunt called ""satanic panic"" very similar to the Salem witch trials of history. If you ever thought Salem can't happen again in this day & age--see this film! Basically, these kids were railroaded for the brutal murder of 3 young boys  because they wore black clothes & liked Metallica (who let the filmmakers uas their songs as a soundtrack for free). Its also amazing because its all the REAL people, the real trial, everything is real, no actors. To top that, the man who probably DID do it is featured prominently in BOTH films! (There is a sequel to this that continues the story further, just shown on HBO.) This film is a TRUE CRIME lover's Paradise Found! This is a truly great documentary & a very worthy & fascinating cause.",982540800,6,975,4.386740331491713
891336,5,6304438273,"Yes Yes Yes Yes! I first got introduced to this case last year, from Paradise Lost 2: Revelations. Since then I have been fairly active in this case. We must free these boys! This documentary is a great piece of filmwork. It is a dark doumentary about the 1993  murder of three 8 year old boys in Arkansas. Three older boys are convicted of the crime, depsite next to no evidence. Yes, this is a true story, and yes, this does happen in our country! This film(and more so the sequal) is also eerily entertaining. It plays out so strangely, that sometimes you forget you are watching a true story. The characters are quirky. The characters are wierd. But yet characters are true people. I was shocked that something like this could happen. I recommend the sequal (which isn't out yet, considering this film isn't released to Amazon yet) because the Sequal is updated, with more shocking news and evidence that has been discovered since the filming of the first one. This movie will stay with you. The plight of the West Memphis Three will stay with you. Justice must be served. Please stand up and take notice.

IMy heart break for these three babies that was Killed and their families. But  what  Ploice department in this country world let a man that had blood run off their arm and had mud all over them walk away? This part in the movie blow my mind for a mintue; then  I thought well we are living in a country where a lot of guilty men walk free while policemen look the other way at a poor white preson or either a black America . Sad to say but it so true in this country.

7872892,2,6304438273,One of the most frustrating docu's I've seen. Maybe I'm just used to the manufactured true-crime type shows on TV. Emphasis seemed mostly on family reactions - so in that way interesting slice of life in how average low income Americans reacted to horrible news while knowing they were being filmed. Never got the sense that anyone was in charge or that there were any legal professionals or crime lab etc involved. It did shine a light on a horrible story I hadn't been previously aware of - both of the crimes against three 2nd-graders and (***spoiler ahead***) unfair rush to judgement against the teenagers who - it is ultimately understood now - were unjustly accused. But I can't help thinking there are better documentaries about this story out there.,1518912000,,758,4.838461538461538

I watched this straight through .. had no idea about this case and evidently they were reversed because of pressure (from Hollywood..?) was the catalyst for (fund raising ..?) monies for the release of these Convicted murderers .. I Believe the Prosecution got it Right the First time .. and watching this (I cried ..!) just touched me so deeply because of the gravity of not one, but ~three~ lovely young little boys .. gone from their homes and families .. and the raw reality of the photos, just makes it Real . this is a horrific crime, and captivating movie .
