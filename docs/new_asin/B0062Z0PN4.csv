4934106,4,B0062Z0PN4,"Do yourself a favor, don't have an opinion on whether bombing Nagasaki was the right thing to do until you get some facts.  The movie gives you a balanced view of the laws of intended and unintended consequences.  We can wave the American Flag and be patriotic, but don't do it with ignorance.  See some of the greatest minds of our times wrestle with this issue.  Too often, Americans base very strong opinions on very little thought, background, or data.  This movie will help you objectively see the A-bomb.  Then you can make a decision on whether you feel its use is warranted.  Excellent movie.  Well done.",1328745600,,612,4.654205607476635
4934107,5,B0062Z0PN4,"Full of astounding information that has virtually no resemblance to what we have been led to believe. Duck and cover... ha! Presented in an intimate, human, informative, and very credible way. The stories of the survivors are unbelievable. Thank you!",1327276800,,250,5.275
4934108,5,B0062Z0PN4,"This film's message could not be more timely, and it is delivered with a quiet intelligence...fascinating...I could not look away. I learned so much about this frightening issue, and how remarkably distorted our 'history' can become.  This should be mandatory viewing in High Schools and colleges!",1327190400,,297,5.456521739130435
4934109,5,B0062Z0PN4,"I saw the movie over a month ago but it has stuck with me in ways that few other movies/documentaries do.  I happen to read the reviews written by others so far out of curiosity.  They're all positive.  That's why I titled this review ""Ditto"".  This movie is not a short flashy documentary on the subject.  This is a full length movie that goes into depth on the subject.  The cumulative revelations and the detailed information make the movie difficult to forget.  At the end,I promised myself to remember the movie and the details it revealed.  Now I am thinking I should buy the movie.  There is no way I can remember all the details and I certainly never could tell the story as convincingly as the movie does.  People need to see this movie not only to remember the past but to know that without good governance, open discussion, and a developed and moral consciences equally awful decisions can be made in the future.  It is a lesson in how decisions are made, who makes them, and what the results can be. Since the movie is not likely to be shown widely, buying the movie is a good idea.  Share it with your discussion group, your family, to your children (after they've grown up a bit - it is not for children), etc.",1327017600,,1224,4.415178571428571
4934110,5,B0062Z0PN4,"The Forgotten Bomb is a meticulously crafted documentary, thoroughly researched and presented.  The producers traveled the continental US and Japan to bring us conversations with those most aware of the incredible destruction of nuclear bombs.  The US government continues to claim there was valid reason to drop not just one, but two, of these devices on Japan.  I left this documentary with the thought that, sooner or later, someone else will find a ""valid reason"" for using a nuclear device.

I highly recommend The Forgotten Bomb.  Its thought-provoking presentation of the issue makes it a must-see.  It would serve us all well to spend less time forgetting and more time contemplating the use of nuclear fission and what we can/should do about it.",1326931200,,754,5.0894308943089435
4934111,5,B0062Z0PN4,I'm really excited about this movie. I just saw Frontline's Fukishima coverage and was frightened by the amount of information engineers had ahead of time and didn't heed the warnings. This film is very timely in the age of going forward toward renewable energy and away from nuclear.,1326844800,,284,4.9375
4934112,5,B0062Z0PN4,"This excellent documentary is like many films in one:  the impact on people, the environment, politics, war and peace, advocacy, nuclear science, etc.  It is sure to grab something of importance to everyone who watches it.  It is an important reminder of ""what happened"" at the end of WWII and how the impact of that has not stopped in 2012.  The film presents important scientific information, interviews with key people in a range of fields and inserts some humorous cartoons to help lighten the heavy topic.  Bud Ryan and Stuart Overby have contributed greatly to the important task of educating the public on the whole issue of nuclear.",1326844800,,640,4.888888888888889
4934113,5,B0062Z0PN4,"I saw this screened in San Jose, CA, completely unsure what to expect. What I discovered was an extremely thoughtful approach to a terrifying subject.  The issue of nuclear armaments is not dead, and it is dangerously unstable.  While it might be easy to make a film that basically runs through the streets yelling ""fire!"" on such a topic, the film takes a much more nuanced approach. Certainly it delivers it's moments of dread (forest fires approaching nuclear storage?!). But also has elements of humor and pathos.  I would recommend this film, especially to anyone that feels like the nuclear weapon problem is in the past. It ain't just loose nukes that are a worry.

Also, this film was made before the Fukushima reactor disaster. It's relevance did not take long to be proven.",1326844800,4,783,4.82089552238806
4934114,5,B0062Z0PN4,"I grew up in the 40's and 50's when the Japanese were still viewed as the enemy and the decision to drop the two atomic bombs as Truman's finest hour.  This documentary reached into the dark corners of my mind and swept it clean of any lingering misconceptions remaining from that period.  The Forgotten Bomb ranges widely and delves deeply into the issues surrounding nuclear weaponry.  It is carefully researched and intelligently presented, but it is also heartrending and eye-opening. It pulled me out of my cultural box and forced me to see -- always a good thing!  Five enthusiastic stars!!",1326844800,2,596,4.871287128712871
4934115,5,B0062Z0PN4,I got a chance to see this movie and was blown away by the scope and delivery of the information. I highly recommend Forgotten Bomb to anyone who wants to more about the subject matter or folks who think they know it all- they'll be amazed by the depth and insight!,1326499200,3,265,4.215686274509804
4934116,2,B0062Z0PN4,"Apparently for the producer of the documentary everything that has to do with ""atomic"" or ""nuclear"" is bad. He raises a few valid points, but most of the ""evidence"" presented is anecdotal or opinions of a particular person.",1451692800,5,223,4.894736842105263

4934122,1,B0062Z0PN4,"Honestly, I&iexcl;m not much into writing reviews. However, I just had to share my experiences with the world and save them from the grueling agony that is this horrid &iexcl;documentary.&iexcl;

This leftist piece of emotional garbage doesn&iexcl;t even try to maintain any semblance of objectivity. It neither looks to expose both sides of an issue nor does it attempt to investigate any further beyond the filmmaker&iexcl;s own peacenik perspective.

Like Michael Moore, Bud Ryan begins and ends his &iexcl;documentary&iexcl; by repeatedly reiterating his own anti-nuclear perspective and carefully selecting those who will be interviewed in his movie. Those who support Ryan&iexcl;s anti-all-things-nuclear viewpoint are given ample time to repeatedly make absurd, speculative claims (like the activist who was once a 1st grade teacher and is thus qualified to render an opinion on the indoctrinatory nature of museums on children).

Meanwhile, those who offer a view derived from much broader global considerations at the time during the cold war are carefully edited to make sure their comments are out of context and predictably absurd.

In this documentary, you will learn:

- JFK was a peace-lover who was assassinated because he wanted a nuclear arms reduction.

- Dropping the A-bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were entirely unnecessary and that all Americans ought to feel ashamed of the decision made by our president to save hundreds of thousands (of course, we can&iexcl;t know how many) lives to defeat a determined enemy.

- Evil corporations (the boogeymen of the liberal world) are actually perpetuating nuclear proliferation.

-Barack Obama is awe-inspiring and wonderful but has, sadly, been forced to bend to political pressures by the warmongers to maintain nuclear arms. 

-America hates brown people; that&iexcl;s why we did nuclear testing on atolls in the Marshall Islands

- And of course, the number one thing you will learn by watching this documentary: Nobody is as enlightened or humane as the wannabe-intellectual, hippy-dippy, soccer-watching, soy cappuccino-drinking, Frisbee golf-playing hipster goober that made this film.

The one worthwhile part of this film was the inspiring conviction of D. Harold Agnew, a scientist on the Manhattan Project, who bravely stands by his decision to assist in the Manhattan Project amidst political backlash from nave peaceniks.",1368748800,10,2401,5.530054644808743

4934124,3,B0062Z0PN4,"In high school, my AP history teacher told us that Japan had been ready to surrender World War II, yet the U.S. had hurriedly dropped two atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The atrocity and monstrous cruelty of doing so on a civilian population is something I think can never be justified.

While this documentary was not that well-presented and not as clear as it could be, I did gain an understanding that the amount of nuclear firepower has only increased tremendously since the days of World War II and the Cold War. How some of those in power and high positions can be so short-sighted about the future of the human race and how dangerous mutual destruction is, I don't know.

One thing that I took away from this film is that Harold Agnew (observer of the Hiroshima bombing on the plane, third director of Los Alamos National Laboratory) is a horrible human being. He stated in the documentary that he has gone to Japan and appeared on a TV show where he was confronted by survivors of the Atomic bombing (who were about 10 years old during the bombing). He stated he refused to apologize, told them to remember Pearl Harbor, and stormed off. This gave me the impression of a person lacking in compassion, humanity, and empathy. While what happened at Pearl Harbor was wrong, the atomic bombing of men, women, and children in Japan was wrong as well.

The most interesting and human moments in the documentary were hearing the survivors tell their stories. I would have liked the documentary to focus more on the stories.

""The atom bomb brought an empty victory to the allied arms but it resulted for the time being in destroying the soul of Japan. What has happened to the soul of the destroying nation is yet too early to see."" - Gandhi (quote in the film)

4934125,3,B0062Z0PN4,"This is a video has some interesting facts but it very liberal and the intervewees aren't very credible.  You do gain a huge sense of the tragedy and destructiveness of the weapons but they are over portrayed in a liberal sense with no depiction from the more conservative sense.  I did not like how they even semi bashed nuclear medicine, Which gave me a sense that this was a very anti-progressional video.  Nuclear power has its advantages as does nuclear medicine.  It takes the stand point these are evils.  I do plan to visit the museum in japan and feel sorry for what happened.  But the person who made this really did a fair job, not excellent.

8491578,4,B0062Z0PN4,"There were lots of points to ponder in this video. I didn't agree with everything, but it's sad to think that most of our world leaders today think this is the only way to solve conflict. I just pray there really aren't any crazy leaders anxious to set off any nuclear weapons. I hope they all really enjoy being alive and living a life of quality.  I believe every nation has the right to defend itself, but as someone once said, ""war doesn't prove who's right, just who's left."" If we have an all out nuclear war, I don't think there will be many people left, and the ones who survive will wish they weren't alive.",1506124800,,616,4.310344827586207

8491582,1,B0062Z0PN4,"Terrible waste of time, even worse point of view.  Three worst aspects of this film:

1st: Wrong Narrator for the subject matter. His voice and enunciation sounds like a LGBT pep rally leader, better suited  asking Kindergarten kids  to hold hands and sing Kumbaya, hoping the big mean man with his nukes will go away.

2nd: Fails to even recognize that without Atomic power, the USA would be saluting either the Japanese or German flag. We were losing the war (WWII) and Germany was mere days behind us with their Atomic weapons research.

3rd: There is no timeline.  Every 5-min segment is a different decade.  40's jumps to 90's, then 50's followed by 80's.  Then back to Hiroshima. It's nonsensical.

EDIT: Well aware that my review is harsh, but I'm disgusted that Amazon charges for this.  It is mostly a compilation of clips you can find elsewhere for free.",1486166400,2,864,4.731543624161074
