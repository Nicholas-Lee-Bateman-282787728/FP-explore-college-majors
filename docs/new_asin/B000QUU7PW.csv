8197777,4,B000QUU7PW,"<strong>Wild Seven</strong> (James Hausler, 2006)

Almost every review I have read of <em>Wild Seven</em> in the few days since I watched it has pointed out the same thing: this is a Tarantino rip-off. So I figure I'll get it out of the way in the first sentence, and then follow it up with a hearty ""so what?"". Hausler may have come up with the pulp-free version of <em>Pulp Fiction</em>, but that makes <em>Wild Seven</em> no less fun, entertaining, and worth watching.

Now, I grant you, the movie starts off with, arguably, the stupidest scene I've ever seen in a heist film: Petey (Tyler Parkinson, better known as a composer/recordist on such films as <em>Warrior</em> and <em>The Crazies</em>), Buckley (Hausler), and Conner (Hausler regular Christopher M. Clark) are about to rob a bank. So they get out of the car, stand in front of the front door--guns in plain sight, mind you--and put on their bandanas. By the end of that shot, I was ready to call this movie a failure and get on with my life, but then we get the next shot, which finishes the opening sequence, and I said ""okay, I'm willing to give this another chance"". Then we get the main titles, blah blah blah, and we kick off the second story, which runs parallel to the first. It deals with Wilson (<em>Alligator</em>'s Robert Forster, in the meatiest screen role he's had in at least a decade), just released from prison after a long stretch he did after being framed. He is met outside the gates by counselor/ex-con Lee Marvin (Richard Roundtree), and not five minutes goes by before Wilson has proposed a heist: one in which Wilson and Lee are only players who exist to set up Mackey (Robert Loggia), the guy who framed Wilson back in the day. Meanwhile, our trio of incompetents from the opening sequences, along with their pals Nick (Zev Stern in his only screen appearance to date) and Phillip (<em>Come Away with Me</em>'s Michael Mandell), plot their own heist. It quickly becomes obvious that the two bands of crooks are planning on holding up the same bank, on the same day, at the same time...

It's quick, it's sharp, it's funny, and okay, Hausler doesn't have Quentin Tarantino's ear for dialogue, but no one in OR out of Hollywood has Quentin Tarantino's ear for dialogue. Forster, Roundtree, and Loggia are all top-class genre-film actors who still have chops, but haven't had the wide-open spaces in which to exercise them for quite a while; all three were obviously having a ball making this movie, and the movie is the better for it. In contrast, Hausler and his second-story men are less accomplished, and those sequences of the film suffer in comparison, but they do credible work; no one would be complaining about the bad acting in the young-guy sequences were it not being compared with Forster, Roundtree, and Loggia (and really, who COULD compare in that demographic?).  It's obviously low-budget, and once you've figured out the mechanics of the thing you'll probably have a good idea of where it's all going, but the setup is good enough that you probably won't care. This is a movie far superior to its current IMDB rating, which is under 5 as I write this; very worth your time if you're a fan of the gangster/heist comedy. *** ",1327449600,3,3228,4.736654804270462
8197778,1,B000QUU7PW,"Should there ever be a class of worse movies this movie will score the number one position.  A 'no star' rating is too good for this movie.  Luckily I saw it on DVD, so I fast forwarded through the whole thing.  My eyes and ears found my action extremely commendable.  I wish I had read the reviews before I picked up this piece of trash in the movie store.  As soon as I am through writing this review I am going to break the DVD.",1207440000,2,431,4.023529411764706
8197779,1,B000QUU7PW,"I guarantee you, by the time the movie is over you will want to break the DVD in half. If you feel like your waiting for the movie to make sense or for things to get interesting, you will be suddenly surprised by.. CREDITS! Yes it is indeed horrible, I am baffled how movies even get produced like this. The feeling I got from this movie was anger, when it ended I could not believe I wasted 2 hours of my life, gone forever. Stay far far away from this movie, its not even REMOTELY entertaining, I promise you that. As far as the other people who think this movie is good? I'm guessing they find watching mindless acting for the sake of acting enjoyable.. whatever.",1195344000,4,666,4.2936507936507935
8197780,2,B000QUU7PW,"You know from the long, long, long opening shot and the surfing music on the soundtrack that someone wants to be another Tarantino. It's quickly (after the long, long shot) established that the theme is crime and that there is going to be heavy emphasis on dialogue. Problem is, other than the profanity there's not much in common with QT's dialogue or with his ability to weave and convolute his story and then make it all fall clearly into place at the end.

What it does have going for it is Richard Roundtree, Robert Loggia and Robert Forster. Masters of their craft here. I'm no expert on Roundtree's filmography but this is his best performance in my experience. He should play real people rather than cool ones henceforth. Loggia is over the top and frightening. Forster is low key. I could listen to that gravel voice all day.

Wild Seven is a reference to a Japanese movie the young criminals like to watch. There is a ""What goes around, comes around"" line early in the film. And people like to call this flick karmic. But I'm with Roundtree who tells Forster, ""You are just plain selfish."" In my book, this is a morality tale.",1194134400,3,1136,4.563725490196078
8197781,1,B000QUU7PW,"I saw this two years ago at the LA Film Festival and how it got accepted begs further investigation into the vetting process at the LAFF.  The name cast is wasted here, as the director and also only young actor pictured on the cover, has no idea what he is doing unless it looks good or involved a CGI scorpion plopped into the film just to make things ""cool.""  If you're watching this to see seasoned actors in the limelight, you would be misled by the marketing on the jacket.  It's principally  about the young actors bitchslapping each other and drinking in endlessly long scenes.  Or, perhaps by now, it's been re-edited, and the unnecessary takes of the young turks drinking and being so cruel to each other that you wonder how they managed to stay friends long enough to get involved in the heist coordinated by Robert Forrester have been trimmed so you're not tempted to reach for the remote and fastforward to a moment when something actually happens.  I won't spoil anything else for you, if you really are intent on watching it, but suffice it to say that, at the screening I attended, when the characters began to get exactly what they deserved, people cheered.",1192752000,5,1173,4.615384615384615
8197782,1,B000QUU7PW,"I thought this was one of the worst movies I had ever seen.  I'd give 0 stars if I could, and would like the two hours of my life back.  The direction makes Uwe Boll seem like Scorsese, and the acting of the younger cast was simply horrible.  It is an obvious Tarantino knock-off, and a bad one at it.  The plot makes no sense and will leave you confused.  Watching some of the veteran actors may be tempting but I'd say avoid at all costs.",1188691200,6,440,4.069767441860465
