8174043,4,B0001ZWY6M,"This movie is unexpectantly well done in both production and direction with the players acting in a more Western pace and script flow while retaining the essence of the Chinese culture. This means there are very few long stares with no movement typical of too many Chinese mainland productions. While it is subtitled and thus leaves doors closed to some audiences, the true Chinese culture is easier to ""feel"" with the normal languge left intact. This movie makes a welcome addition to any of the better libraries or,if not to own,a well deserved rental choice.",1257292800,,561,4.91578947368421
