8195508,1,B000QCQUNI,I wanted an exercise video for a 2 ye old. This video only has one small segment of jumping around and waving your arms. The rest is just characters talking. Poor quality.,1477353600,,171,4.375
8195509,4,B000QCQUNI,Bought this so my kids could have their own exercise video - instead of trying to follow mine!  They love Care Bears and this ended up being a fun way to have them get moving and yet see their favorite characters at the same time.  Great price and delivery time; would buy again from this seller.,1379721600,,296,4.267857142857143
