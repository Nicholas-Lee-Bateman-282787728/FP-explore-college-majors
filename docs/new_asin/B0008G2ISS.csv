8056156,5,B0008G2ISS,A nice compliation of material much I had not seen before. A perfect addition to my collection. Reccomend to all whole like this plane.,1374451200,,135,4.666666666666667
8056157,5,B0008G2ISS,"if one day you have a dream to be close to this aicraft and to have a relevant information about it, buy it.",1361491200,,108,3.739130434782609
8056158,2,B0008G2ISS,"I am a fan of this sort of material.  I own all of the Spacecraft Films series and this DVD is from the same company.  I ordered the DVD directly from Spacecraft Films.  When the package arrived the DVD was seemingly made on a PC as the disc was a simple DVD-R with a cheap case and the paper insert contains no information at all.  On the disc itself; the production reports included were very interesting but the biggest flaw in the set is that there is NO mention of the tragic crash and loss of the second XB-70.  This very much confuses me how a major part of the program; the loss of one of two planes is not even mentioned.

I am VERY disappointed in this disc.",1314489600,,668,4.1395348837209305
8056159,5,B0008G2ISS,"USAF testing of the XB-70 between 1964 and 1966 is exhaustively covered by this great five star DVD.  The XB-70 was designed to operate at Mach 3 and 70000 feet and as far as I know she met all her design objectives.

Sadly, this project was cancelled after flight testing and might have served as a baseline for an American Mach 3 SST, however, it was said to be environmentally unfriendly to the ozone layer and the fuel crisis.

Warning, the last 3 out of 4 hours of this footage is silent and for aviation weenies only!",1239840000,,523,4.371134020618556
8056160,5,B0008G2ISS,this state-of-the-art bomber XB-70 valkyrie is documented on this exceptional DVD via official film footage. a definite necessary DVD for every aviation fan or expert.,1185062400,,167,5.72
8056161,4,B0008G2ISS,"This DVD is a collection of the XB-70 flight test films. The first 3 films have sound as well, but the remaining videos do not. The films are excellent quality, and dramatically beautiful, just as the aircraft were.

Although the XB-70's were ungainly on the ground, at 70,000 feet and Mach 3 with the wing tips folded down, I believe they were the most beautiful machines ever created.

This is a must-have video for all those who agree!",1175472000,6,438,4.602564102564102
8056162,3,B0008G2ISS,Great DVD of a great aircraft. Featuring rare flighttest footages for XB-70 enthusiasts with never seen before shots of that unique aircraft. Just a pity that a big portion of the documentation has no sound. If they would have added at least some music it would have made it a bit easier to watch.,1175212800,,297,4.518518518518518
8056163,5,B0008G2ISS,"As an XB-70 enthusiast, this DVD is a brilliant addition to my collection. I could probably have watched all four hours in one sitting had I not restrained myself.

Most of the major events during the flight testing of the Valkyrie are featured, often from multiple angles.

If you are not a Valkyrie enthusiast, this film would probably become repetitive and boring fairly quickly. But if you are a fan, then it's deserving of five stars.",1169078400,,439,4.7631578947368425
8056164,1,B0008G2ISS,If you are expecting almost 4 hours of informative information forget it.  The program contains almost 3 hours of silent film.  Hardly worth the effort,1165881600,8,151,5.0
8056165,4,B0008G2ISS,"I really liked the first hour of this four hour production.  This section contains the progress reports from North American Aviation to the U.S. Air Force from mid 1964 to the end of 1965.  The other three hours are silent flight test footage and various incidents associated with the XB-70 program.  It was hard for me to watch the same two planes take-off and land again without much forward scan speed.

  Although well put together, I would probably recommend this DVD for XB-70A enthusiasts who have prior knowledge of the aircraft.",1144800000,8,537,4.846153846153846
