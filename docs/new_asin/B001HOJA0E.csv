8309254,5,B001HOJA0E,"If there were a film award named after Andrei Tarkovsky this film should win it. This film is not a horror film or apocalypse film (in the traditional sense of the word). It is a meditation on existence and the result of mankind being rapidly accelerated through its evolution before having the skills and talents to handle the responsibility of such power (thus reflecting on such things as nuclear weapons, genetic engineering, etc).

Fans of the film Stalker will likely enjoy this film, but it does not have the dynamic landscapes presented in Stalker, instead the tension is built with excellent sound design and occasional glimpses of what fate has befallen others who have tried to destroy the creature that waits for them ahead. The film uses concepts of inner and outer space like the novel House of Leaves and time is warped inside the structure where the film takes place.

If you are a fan of films like Stalker, Begotten or Structuralist films like Michael Snow's Wavelength then I would highly recommend this film. For fans of Lynch and Cronenberg who are feeling adventurous I would also rec this film.

This is director Karim Hussain's masterpiece (who is often better known for his work on other projects as cinematographer like the recent Antiviral by  Brandon Cronenberg (David Cronenberg's son), the tv series Hannibal and the horror anthology film The ABCs of Death.

Now if we could just get a proper release in the U.S.",1400284800,,1442,4.869387755102041
8309255,1,B001HOJA0E,"I really looked forward to see this movie. I am a big fan of horror/apocalypse stories and a religious/psychological twist is not a bad addition. On the cover it said that the movie was inspired by Tarkovskij, that the Writer/Director will become the next Lynch/Cronenberg. It had all these different movie festival price/selection tags. My thought was: Wow! this will be an awesome dark story that really scares you and it will probably mess with your head as well. Boy was I wrong. This is definitely one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and I have seen many bad ones. It has no story what so ever. Terrible, amateurish and quasi intellectual dialogue, luckily there isn't much of it. The visuals are extremely poor, no atmosphere and the cinematography is non existant. SPOILER WARNING - The movie is about three women (dressed in cloaks) of different ages that walk up the stairs in an old abandoned factory, only one makes it to the top... THAT'S IT. That takes 1 hour and 43 minutes so you can imagine how much time is wasted filming rusty staircases and old concrete walls... with a video camera. The whole movie feels like a bad high school movie project in every aspect, not only the budget. No offense to the makers, making movies is hard. But, having all these tags and recommendations from serious film festivals makes me question the knowledge and intellect of those people. Their only excuse would be if they were not sober when they watched/reviewed this movie. DON'T BUY IT! If this is considered good, I am definitely from the wrong planet.",1291420800,2,1562,4.725274725274725
