1977417,5,B00018YCJ6,At last! If you enjoyed this show when it was on tv - then you can now relax and have the whole enchilada  together in one impressive set. Television does not get any better than this superb series. For those of you who never saw this show - please spend the money - you'll be glad you did. Don't buy Homicide in separate seasons - get it all at once and save - what a great deal!,1159315200,12,380,3.935064935064935
1977418,5,B00018YCJ6,"I can't imagine anyone watching the first three seasons of this show and needing a review to urge them onward, but in case you do I'll be brief.  This is a show that has stopped worrying about whether or not they're going to get cancelled next week.  The ratings haven't been exceptional, but they have been exceptionally consistent, and the producers have put the pedal down to see what this puppy can do.  Man, is it fun to watch.  This is a network TV production at its finest and most creative.  Homicide showed studio and network executives that there was money to made off edgy shows.  Without visionary producers Fontana and Levinson, we might never have had The Shield, Rescue Me and a dozen other high-quality, small audience cable dramas.  So put it in your cart already and savor a piece of TV history.",1142121600,2,813,4.604166666666667
1977419,5,B00018YCJ6,"The quality here is almost indescribable. So many great episodes, so much fine acting from the entire cast to match the top-notch writing and production. Fortunately, much of the quality is sustained through Season 5, so I'm waiting for the DVD release of it and Season 6 (which was still better than 99.99% of the other stuff on US TV at the time).",1087948800,6,349,4.555555555555555
1977420,5,B00018YCJ6,"I would love to purchase Homicide Season 4, but the series I bought from you in the past had no (english) subtitles, although the website promessed it had. For those of us whose mother's tongue is not (American) English the closed caption option is vital to fully enjoy any DVD.",1080950400,12,278,4.58
1977421,5,B00018YCJ6,"The fourth season of Homicide is packed with all the things that make it great television; intelligent writing, complex characters, top-flight acting and unique photography.  However, the drama is ratcheted up a notch, removing it somewhat from its book-based, slower-moving roots in the first season.  It is also the year of the Dynamic Duo (Pembleton and Bayliss, plus Lewis and Kellerman.)  Meldrick Lewis has been without a partner since the suicide of his former partner, Crosetti, in the show's third season.  Enter Mike Kellerman (Reed Diamond), a hotshot detective from the Arson Squad who impresses Giardello and is transferred into the unit.  Lewis and Kellerman find that they are a good fit and their light and breezy chemistry is a breath of fresh air in an often dark atmosphere.  The two bring a spark of fun into work, as evidenced by such episodes as, ""Full Moon,"" ""I've Got a Secret,"" and most notably, ""The Hat,"" in which they allow a seemingly harmless suspect to escape from custody over a dish of rice pudding.  But the two have their differences as shown in, ""Scene of the Crime,"" when they clash over the role of a Muslim neighborhood patrol group in the murder of a drug-dealer.  Lewis and Kellerman would also have their first encounter with ruthless drug lord, Luther Mahoney in, ""The Damage Done.""  Mahoney would turn out to be a major villain and would start a running plot thread that would last throughout the following two seasons.  Meanwhile, the more philosophical, serious pair of Frank Pembleton and Tim Bayliss would face their own difficulties throughout the year.  Bayliss is haunted by the unsolved Adena Watson case from the first season in, ""Requiem for Adena,"" when he finds himself working on another child murder.  Pembleton also faces his personal demons in the Law & Order crossover, ""For God and Country,"" when he confronts a domestic terrorist who bombed a black church several years before.  Pembleton is burdened by the knowledge that he is about to become a father, but his problems only get worse when he is felled by a stroke in the season finale, ""Work Related.""  Shift Commander Al Giardello is developed more fully in the intense episode, ""Thrill of the Kill,"" as well as, ""The Wedding.""  Unfortunately, while some characters get more camera time, others like Howard and Munch, are seen less.  The departure of Stan Bolander and Beau Felton left them without partners.  Kay Howard remedies her situation by taking the Sergeant's Exam.  Her promotion restricts her to the squad room and she spends less time solving cases, which was always her strong suit.  John Munch lands an unexpected partner when Megan Russert is demoted from Captain, but the two don't share the same interplay that afforded Munch so many of his verbal gems with Bolander.  Luckily, one of Munch's finest episodes comes along in, ""Heartbeat,"" when he matches wits with a poetic killer who is a fan of Edgar Allan Poe. This would be Russert's final year, as Isabella Hofmann would leave the series at the end of the season.  We are also introduced to Brodie, a nerdish free-lance photographer who ends up taping crime scenes for the unit.  Other notable episodes include, ""A Doll's Eyes,"" in which two parents struggle through the grieving process after their 10-year-old son is shot at a mall and left on life support.  Also, ""Stake-out,"" a character-driven episode that is reminiscent of Homicide's first season, and the two-part, ""Sniper,"" in which Baltimore is terrorized by a killer who plays a mysterious game with the police.
As is the case with the previous seasons, the picture quality and sound are far superior to the reruns from TV.  The folks who put together the box sets for The Sopranos could take a lesson from the song listings on each disk in this package, as they are a nice touch for those who enjoy the music in each episode.  I was disappointed to find that A&E again excluded the previouslies, and they again did not incorporate chapter breaks in between episodes.  They made a chronological slip when placing the episode, ""Scene of the Crime,"" as it is out of story order.  The events in, ""Work Related,"" take place directly after, ""The Wedding.""  New viewers may be a bit confused by this error.  Some viewers will inevitably complain that only the second half of the Law & Order crossover is present.  It would be nice to see the first half of the story, but it is not imperative to fully appreciate the events in the Homicide conclusion.  Clark Johnson seems to have a good time with his commentary on, ""The Hat,"" and the bonus documentary was a plus.  Despite some technical blunders, the fourth season of Homicide is another solid television masterpiece that belongs in anyone's collection, fan or otherwise.

1977422,5,B00018YCJ6,"This is the must-have season for me, because here's where my favorite pairing in the entire show-- Meldrick and Mikey-- team up. Though Reed Diamond was brought on board to ""prettify"" the show,  he proves to have the acting talent to keep up with Braugher, Leo, Belzer, Kotto etc.  Don't get me wrong, I loved Jon Polito (R.I.P Crosetti!), and I never thought it could get any better than his pairing with Clark Johnson.  But even though the dynamic changed, the writing, action and emotional stuff didn't.  Thanks Homicide writers!  This season is where you hit your stride.",1079568000,5,575,4.826530612244898
1977423,5,B00018YCJ6,"While Homicide would continue for three more seasons, season 4 was the last true great season of this marvelous show.  This is thanks to NBC's tampering.  This season includes the best episode of any television drama (a bold statement, but watch it and see), ""A Doll's Eyes"" a heartbreaking tale of a little boy shot in a mall, and the trauma his parents suffer.  Other episodes of interest: Thrill of the Kill, Full Moon, and Stakeout.  Homicide season 4: Buy it!",1075852800,13,464,4.691358024691358
1977424,5,B00018YCJ6,"""Homicide"" season 4 preserved the show's unique trend of realistic murder mysteries mixed in with a decidedly non-soap-opera look at the lives of its detectives.  This year featured the show's first true crossover with ""Law & Order"", and also featured three other two-part episodes, as well as some surprising guest turns.
Beau Felton and Stan Bolander are gone.  That's the bad news.  However, Mike Kellerman (Reed Diamond), a hot-shot arson detective, joined the squad in the season-opening two-parter (""FIre) and soon we're introduced to Brodie (Max Pehrlich), the oddball videographer hired by Giardello (Yaphet Kotto) and Russert to document the unit.  Bayliss (""Requiem for Adena"") and Pembleton (""Work Related"") remained the show's signature detectives.  Bad news was in store for Russert's (Isabella Hoffmann) rapid career advancement, shortly after Howard (Melissa Leo) got promoted to sergeant.
""Homicide"" was also noteworthy for its guest stars.  Names you'll recognize this season include Chris Rock, Lily Tomlin (nominated for an Emmy), Stephanie Romanov (""Angel""), Illeana Douglas, J.K. Simmons (""Law & Order""), Dean Winters (""Oz""; reprising a role from the previous season),  and surprising glimpses of Mandy Patinkin and Jay Leno.  Also appearing are Melissa Leo (doing double-duty playing Howard's sister) and Peter Gerety, as a uniform who'd go on to join the regular cast during the show's final seasons.

1977488,2,B00018YCJ6,Was so looking forward to this series. Came on time no damages. Put my first disc in. Picture quality is average not great. But here's the thing whoever was recording these DVDs it sounds like they were playing their stereo the whole time. There is music playing through the whole show and all the shows that I've watched so far. I don't remember this going on when I watched it when it was on the air. Please don't waste your money. Unless you don't mind music playing through the whole show. And poor picture quality. Can't believe this is the best they can do after all this time what a shame guess I will have to wait and hope for Blu-ray.

It also has a few of the crossover episodes of Law and Order, plus commentaries on some of the episodes with David Simon and some of the other writers and producers. The video quality is a bit fuzzy, which brings me back to watching the show on my crappy little TV (no cable) when I was a kid. But the price is much reduced from when the seasons were sold separately. Sill,expensive, though.

The acting and the show are as wonderful as I remember them. Even having just rewatched the first episode, the characters feel fully formed and deep--they go far beyond the tip of the iceberg that's shown in the programs. I'm a complete David Simon fanboy, and I truly love this show and the book it's based on. Can't recommend this enough.

Yes this set is pricey, but since my second favorite show in history (The Wire is #1) isn't streaming anywhere, this is well worth it.",1499212800,8,929,4.491124260355029

1977542,5,B00018YCJ6,"Even into Season 4 this series continues to be one of the best I have ever seen, with deep, complex characterization and the ability to somehow make even the corniest, most cliche material and make it feel not only fresh again but emotionally honest. That said, there are a few minor quibbles here and there. Characters like Howard (Melissa Leo) are becoming increasingly sidelined in favor of the Pembleton-Bayliss duo (which, admittedly, has long been the heart of the show), or being replaced with new characters like the smarmy-yet-honest Kellerman (Reed Diamond) or the mousy, annoying Brodie (Max Perlich). Also, with all the pressure being put on the show by NBC executives, it is slowly losing its gritty, realistic tone and favoring more blatantly dramatic storylines. That it manages to maintain a high level of quality in spite of this is a testament to all the talent and dedication involved. While most TV shows I've seen peaked in their second or third season and went downhill quickly after, Homicide deftly avoids this pitfall and continues to surprise and entertain.",1420156800,4,1083,5.055865921787709

1977569,5,B00018YCJ6,"I watched all five seasons of ""The Wire"", and I was craving more, until I realized that the Baltimore author, David Simon, wrote the books which inspired both ""The Wire"" and this show. So, on faith, I got the full seven seasons of Homicide, and I was not disappointed. If you like ""The Wire"", I can virtually guarantee that you will like ""Homicide"".

Both shows have ensemble casts, and follow the pattern of ""Hill Street Blues"" rather than the ""Law and Order"" model, where all four or six principle characters are in every episode. An entire episode of Homicide can go by and you don't see a third of the cast, and another third of the cast  are background or ""color"". Aside from ""Hill Street Blues"", the show this most reminds me of is ""The Closer"", except that there is less activity away from the squad room, and no character plays as central a role as Brenda Lee Johnson, and there is less cordial, more realistic interactions with ""the bosses"", above the shift commander Lieutenant.

I'm glad I got all the seasons at once, because if I had just gotten the first season, I may have been a tad disappointed at first. On the one hand, there are several delightful, strong characters. lead by Ned Beatty (in the only ""featured"" role, Andre Braugher, Yaphet Kotto and Richard Belzer (Yes, I know, Belzer is NOT in the same class of actor as the first three, but by now, he is such a familiar face that he makes you feel at home.) On the other hand, Daniel Baldwin and Jon Polito don't seem to fit in, which is probably why they leave in after the third and second seasons respectively.

Both leave by their dying, Polito's character by suicide and Baldwin's character by shooting. The reaction to deaths, and even to woundings in this show is more intense than you see in any other cop show. The interactions between characters is deep, especially between partners, such as between characters played by Beatty and Belzer.

Aside from Beatty, one performance stands head and shoulders over the others. That is the role of Frank Plembleton, played by Richard Braugher. The show's producers can be thankful that he stayed for six out of the seven seasons.

The show does follow patterns similar to some some other cop shows, where there is a crime of the day in the foreground, and a situation with one or more characters persisting in an ark over several episodes, usually between two and four, although one does last for the better part of a season and another spans all seven seasons.

The extras in this set are well worth while. The best is the three ""Law and Order"" episodes in which two or three ""Homicide"" characters, especially Detective Munch, appear. Each is paired with three Homicide episodes, in which two or three ""Law and Order"" characters, primarily Briscoe, appear in ""Homicide"" episodes.

There is also a full length 2 hour TV movie, in which all the characters over the seven seasons reappear. The plot is a reasonably good mystery, but the object of the film is simply to pull everyone together one last time.",1416009600,3,3029,4.659176029962547

1977602,4,B00018YCJ6,"Back in the day, networks stood behind the shows they picked up. They believed in them, they advertised them, they pushed them to do whatever they could to get ratings. Unfortunately, things are much different today, as a new show is given 13 episodes to crack the top 50 on the Nielsen charts, and if they fail, they're gone before they even got started. If this had always been the policy, shows like Cheers, The X-Files, Law & Order, & Homicide: Life On The Street never would have gotten started.

NBC took a real chance on this show, the cast was all unknowns, except for Ned Beatty, and the rating for the first season were in the toilet. NBC saw the potential though, they realized they had a special cast full of future award winners, and a terrific writing staff, so they made the show more intense. Regular characters could be killed off or added every week, they got big name guest stars, and even had crossover episodes with highly successful shows like Law & Order and The X-Files. With the network behind it, the series soared, completing 7 seasons, winning 4 Emmy's, and it was even turned into a full length feature film.

Homicide: Life On The Street, follows a unit of Homicide Detectives in one of the worst areas of Baltimore, which at the time, had one of the highest murder rates in the country. We follow the investigation, similar to the way they do in Law & Order, but what's different here, is that Homicide is more character based. The audience gets to intimately know the Detectives, their families, and their lives, but even that wasn't the real strength of the show. What made Homicide unique, an Emmy winner, and the launching point for almost a dozen big named actors was ""The box"" A.K.A. the interrogation room. Homicide takes us into the interrogation room in a way that has never been done before, showing all the emotion, stress, and everything that comes with the process.

What I really love about this show is that everyone is used equally and no one is a star! Every member of the cast is important and even the opening credits are in alphabetical order, giving no one top billing. That was how the show was designed, but the truth is that Andre Braugher moved beyond that and become a legend.

Playing the very complex Detective, Frank Pembelton, Andre Braugher made a name for himself by captivating audiences. Everything that happened was so deep and personal to him, and he put the emotion into everything he did, not only making him the best detective in the squad, but also the best character to watch.

Homicide takes you inside the interrogation room, but also inside the lives of Homicide Detectives the way that no other show has done before or since. It's a one of a kind show that survived, only because someone important at the network actually watched it and saw how amazing it is. If you're looking for a great show to get into, there are 7 seasons and over 100 episodes, and take my word for it, this show is as addicting as anything I've ever seen!",1404604800,,3005,4.588454376163873
1977603,4,B00018YCJ6,"A show that began so well, so different, documentary-like before documentary-like became pass began the slow bleed around about season 4.

Some of the best ever written television is to be found in Homicide; The Subway, A Doll's Eyes, Three Men & Adena, Bop Gun, Fallen Heroes Parts I & II, (the list could go on and on here, trust me); are absolutely stunning TV; but alas, this is the season where the slow-bleed began, leaving a once great show, a limping, crawling mess come Season 7, in fact it would be fair to say that the show itself became a unfortunate victim of the most brutal form of homicide: death by TV Execitis.

1977616,5,B00018YCJ6,"Loved this show when it aired and recently bought the entire award winning series to watch all over again.  This series is about the Baltimore Homicide Department, and the cops that pursue killers in ""Charm City.""  Even better than I remember it, and some relationships make more sense to me now than they did then.  Excellent casting, superb dialog and the interaction of characters is perfect. But don't look for sugar coating in this story.  Cops get shot, commit suicide, cops make mistakes, cops get married and divorced, suspects get away, some murderers elude prosecution with legal maneuvers. If you've never seen it and have been using NCIS and LALaw as your criteria for ""it always ends right"" police drama, this show will blow you away. Pembleton ""in the box"" with a suspect, Munch analyzing society, Lewis keeping his own counsel and occasionally trying to keep peace within the Homicide squad's diverse personalities, Bayliss wondering if he's too sensitive to be a cop, Kellerman flying off the handle. Old detectives leave, new ones come in, and the squad just goes on, working as a team, finding killers, knocking on doors chasing down suspects and heading to the bar at the end of the day.  This is without a doubt the best police series ever made.  When real cops viewed this show when it first aired they claimed it was truer to the real thing than any other show, ever.  I only wish shows of this caliber were still being produced.  Oh, well. Time travel back to this one -- you won't regret it.",1399593600,11,1515,4.733840304182509

If you're lucky, you may be able to track down a copy of the PBS documentary that showed the creative process of the episode titled The Subway.

1977620,3,B00018YCJ6,"Emily Nussbaum, TV critic for The New Yorker, in a recent critical piece about ""True Detective,"" praised the series ""Homicide"" highly. I then checked on Amazon and noted the many glowingly positive things that people said about ""Homicide,"" so I went ahead and ordered it.

I am well underway in season 1, and I must say that to me this series is a disappointment. It is very significantly below the great shows of the past and present, e.g., ""The Wire,"" ""The Sopranos,"" ""Breaking Bad,,"" etc. It is also far below ""Ray Donovan,"" ""Top of the Lake,"" and other very good series. ""Homicide"" (it began in 1993) seems pretty dated, a series that has not stood the test of time. At best, I would say that it is OK. Nothing more.

To me, again thus far, the writing in ""Homicide"" is thin and superficial; there is little to no depth in the characters and in their relationships. The so-called realism feels forced and artificial, contrived. I am dutifully watching an episode each night, but that is what it feels like--a duty, not a pleasure.

I plan to do some more watching and browsing. Maybe the later episodes & seasons are better. But I wanted to post my review now. This DVD set is expensive! So if you buy it, do not start watching it with too-high expectations.",1394668800,,1262,4.575221238938053

1977651,2,B00018YCJ6,"This was the first series based on David Simon's remarkable book (""Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets""). (The second series was HBO's ""The Wire,"" an extraordinary, character-driven, grittily real series that incorporated Simon's book with Ed Burns, ""The Corner,"" about the damage done by drugs to Baltimore's urban core.) ""Homicide"" came on the air around 1990, & it hasn't aged well. The first few episodes are taken directly from the book, but the characters aren't much more than a set of clich&eacute;s. The tough Irish detective has been turned into a young, attractive redhead (female). The detective sergeant is no longer a hefty Irish white guy, but an uptight black man (Get the joke? He's black, but he insists on wearing a white shirt & tie! Even in the hottest weather! Isn't that ironic & amusing? Actually, no. It isn't.) The street detective who becomes obsessed with the murder of a little black girl no longer has years of experience but is now a newbie who doesn't even have his own desk, & must ""fight"" his supervisor (throwing papers on the floor & generally acting like a 3-year-old) to gain respect. Yeah, right. Every character has been given an ostensibly amusing personality quirk - the black detective who orders his shot of whisky with a glass of milk on the side, the Ned Beatty character who wants to date the attractive coroner but is shy & self-conscious about his appearance (let's make fun of the heavyset white guy) (but not to worry, she goes out with him anyway after he sends her flowers, which is actually kind of a creepy thing to do when you think about it), the detective obsessed with ""conspiracy theories"" (not, strangely enough, Richard Belzer's character, who went on to work ""Law & Order: SVU"" as a detective with conspiracy theory issues, although he still gets stuck with the running jokes about his multiple failed marriages). I read ""Homicide"" (the book) on Kindle & the updated version has several afterwords, one of them suggesting tactfully that Simon wasn't real happy with what the producers of this series did with his book & his characters. I had just recently finished binge-watching ""The Wire."" ""Homicide"" suffers greatly by comparison. A lot has happened to AMC & cable TV in general since it was filmed - ""Breaking Bad"" for example - & ""Homicide"" now seems lame, trite & just generally outdated.",1389916800,,2361,4.861042183622828

 I also loved the way the cast gave back to the city, with their shows. My son treated me to go to one and we met with the cast, took pictures, got autographs. It was a wonderful experience they were wonderful people.

I am still blown away by the stories and drama in this series, the characters are intelligent, the show is deadly serious but will often mix in a joke or two if not take it to near-sitcom levels. There are a number of story arcs and character development that you see watching the series in order, and was lost on me when I first started watching.

It's also fun re-watching old episodes and recognizing actors who are now famous for other roles, there are almost too many to name, for example Jeffrey Donovan (Burn Notice), Terry O'Quinn (Lost), etc..

Only drawback is that I am now so used to HD tv and movies that going back to old 90s style standard definition tv quality is a little rough on the eyes. The content makes it worth it.",1359763200,,932,4.375722543352601

1977762,5,B00018YCJ6,"For fans of David Simon's The Wire, a must! The grainy photography fits well with the everyday look at the inside workings of a big city homicide unit. The murders being investigated by the unit merely provide a background to the real story: the interaction of the detectives and how they deal with each other and police bureaucracy.

If you are looking for detailed crime stories, blood and guts and high tech crime solving in the manner of CSI Miami, this series is not for you. This 130+ episode set is based on a book by David Simon after he spent a year inside the Baltimore homicide unit. The book and the series avoids any attempt at glamorizing police work.  Instead it's a gritty study of how real police departments deal with the real problems of a big city and the frustrations that go along with it. It's also a social commentary on the decay of inner-city America. I read the book before watching the series, which was a great help in understanding the background of some of the stories (some of which are based on real cases).

My only complaint is the lack of subtitles. The east coast accents of the characters, especially when they talk softly, may be difficult for some to understand. My German wife also finds the dialogue difficult to understand on occasion. But that's no reason not to buy it. And while you are at it, purchase The Wire, the greatest thing ever produced for television!",1348012800,2,1407,4.597609561752988

1977764,5,B00018YCJ6,"With so many excellent reviews already available for this product, one might question the need for another. I hope to offer some comparative details for those familiar with other investigative shows on TV who don't know Homicide and are still on the fence about buying it.

If you are a fan of Law & Order, you will probably enjoy the show, but if you are stictly a CSI kind of person, you might not. Personally, I don't care much for CSI - and I only say this to offers viewers concrete examples to decide on buying Homicide (or not), and not to criticize the many fans of the program. Though I understand CSI's appeal, it is simply too ""showy"" for my taste. The people are beautiful, the crimes graphic, the stories usually have neat little endings. Homicide is the opposite. You might say where CSI is a high-gloss fashion magazine, Homicide is a newspaper. You pick it up and your hands will get dirty. But you will also get real stories, real people, real life. Episodes don't all have clean endings - crimes sometimes take several episodes to be solved, and plot is not defined by hunting down bad guys in dramatic car changes. You might, for example, stumble across an episode that is interrogation (of a suspect) from beginning to end. Yet it is never boring - on the contrary! You are a part of the bad ventilation and neon lighting, you can smell the sweat and tension the detectives emit, and you want them to succeed as much as they do. It's more than entertainment - it's an experience.

The magic word regarding the success of this show is dialog. Even when it's ordinary, you find yourself learning more about the characters. Nothing is accidental or trivial, though it may seem so on the surface. I watched the show regularly back in the 90's and bought the entire series hoping it hadn't lost the appeal I felt for it back then. It did not, not one bit. If anything, it's even better than I remember.

So if you like fast-paced action, but think the show sounds interesting, you'd probably be better off buying just season 1. However, if you (also) like gritty, realistic viewing that doesn't look or feel like Hollywood, this is something for you.",1347667200,2,2165,4.574742268041237
1977765,5,B00018YCJ6,I'm glad that I finally bought this amazing TV show. I heard that that Richard Belzer was one of the main stars of the show and I loved him on other cop shows so I decided to check it out. I'm glad I bought this award winning series.,1340064000,,233,3.875

1977767,5,B00018YCJ6,"A few years ago I started recording a few episodes that aired in the mornings on WGN. Then I would watch them on the weekend. I became interested in the show because I was I was already of a fan of Law & Order SVU, and of course the character John Munch started on Homicide.

Homicide is one of the best realistic police dramas every produced. Unlike the Law & Order franchise, the series showed the characters' private lives, which made the it even more likeable. I didn't care for how a few characters exited out of the show, but they all return, even the dead, in the Homicide: The Movie which is included in the complete series along with the Law & Order crossover episodes.",1338940800,,678,4.380952380952381

1977799,5,B00018YCJ6,"This is a really great box set collection. It not only includes the entire series, by season; it includes the crossover episodes and some really interesting commentaries. This was such a quality, amazing show that is near and dear to my heart since I am from Baltimore. The progressions of the show from the first two short seasons to the longer full length seasons shows how the show gained recognition and popularity. This was a must have for me since you hardly ever see this show in re-runs unlike many other dramas. It hasn't been over-exposed like many shows so it still is exciting to watch after all these years. I have seen all of the episodes before but it's been years and with no re-runs I have no desire to skip through any episodes, they all seem fresh to me. I love that it was the age when we were just on the cusp of the internet, they didn't use the computers, cell phones, GPS or any of those aids that modern police have. Everyone was smoking, even inside all the buildings, which really shows how much TV programs and society has changed. I also love seeing all the famous actors that were on the show, both as main roles and guest stars. It's so fun to see how they have changed and progressed in their careers. From Robin Williams to a very young Jake Gyllenhall to Mekhi Phifer, Steve Buscemi, Chris Rock, James Earl Jones, Elijah Wood and so many others. Even Detective Munch played by Richard Belzer whose character has stood the test of time and is still seen on current programming, Law & Order: SVU.  Overall, it's just a great comprehensive collection with interesting extras. So many extras are just filler, these commentaries are very pertinent. This was one of the most authentic, well written Police Dramas ever to air on television and I for one and happy that the complete series has been put together successfully.",1331942400,2,1851,4.59214501510574

1977803,5,B00018YCJ6,"Awesome package for fans of the series and everyone who has ever lived in Baltimore for a period of time.  The series was shot in large part in an old abandoned police station on the Baltimore waterfront and the city itself is featured throughout in all of it's sometimes gritty beauty and character.  Featurettes are included with most of the DVD's and the commentaries are very cool on pivotal episodes.  It is great to watch the progression of Andre Braugher and Kyle Secor through the series as theirs is, in my mind, the pivotal partnership.  Yaphet Kotto brings a dignity and gravitas to his leadership of the squad and while he has to navigate some difficult and sometimes slimy political waters, he does so without ever compromising himself or his squad.  Homicide survived many cast changes through the years and the newer characters have just as much to offer as some of the old.  On the whole, probably the most real and intelligent police drama in history.  There is also a 2 hr movie included that ties up most of the loose ends, and provides a way for Muench, the darkly humorous class clown of the group to live on in the Law and Order franchise.",1310169600,7,1161,4.606796116504855
1977804,5,B00018YCJ6,"As a filmmaker myself I never realized how much past film or tv work can and has influenced me and several other artists. This show had some of the most realistic and compelling writing and atmosphere of any series or film ever produced. I feel that too much emphasis has been placed on shows like NYPD Blue and the like but that show as well as other ""cop shows"" seemed to feel too forced and kinda too Hollywood. The characters in this show seemed to be more real and flawed and not caricatures of stereotypes like in other dramas of this time. I feel many shows and films that have followed have taken a cue fro the realism of this show. The cinematography of the show has been an influence on many films and tv shows as well. it has a gritty movement to it that has seeped into everything from shows like Breaking Bad to the sadly canceled Detroit 187.

Having never seen the series when it originally aired, and after purchasing the beautiful 'filing cabinet' series set, we poured over each season in order over a several month period one summer. On occasion we could have watched whole seasons in marathon sessions, but forced ourselves to only watch one or two episodes at a time just so we could appreciate and savor it even more.

***SPOILERS FOLLOW***

That said, I can't help but feel the writers of both the series and this closing movie really missed a golden opportunity. Recall the the whole series began with rookie Det. Tim Bayliss' being assigned a case that would haunt and torture him throughout the rest of the series - the murder of a little girl named Adena Watson.

Despite hours of air-time being devoted to the pursuit of this case, culminating in a stunning episode shot entirely in the interrogation room (""The Box""), the characters and viewer never discover the full truth surrounding Adena Watson's murder. As the series progresses Det. Bayliss would periodically be confronted with references and reminders of this painful 'first case'. Doesn't it make perfect sense that the very case that introduced this series to the world, and that left tantalizing bread crumbs throughout the seasons that followed, should be dealt with in the final episode of the series? Or at least been given time in the closing movie that followed?

Adena Watson was the perfect cliff hanger. As each season progressed I just knew that her case was coming back - when? we didn't know. And as the series neared it's end, it became clear that the writers were saving this one for the finale. And why not? It made perfect sense. Closing the Adena Watson case would be the ultimate in 'closure' for this show.

Now, don't get me wrong. I wasn't expecting everything to end with all the loose strands tied up in pretty bows. This wasn't Law & Order after all (a show we also enjoy for it's own merits). Many of Homicide's story lines ended messily. But so do many of the events of real life as well. And that is what made this series gritty and compelling. Nevertheless, of all the haunting cases in the series, this is the one that deserved some measure of 'closure' even if it wasn't going to be neat and clean.

I have to say, while we still look back on the series with fondness, there is a bit of disappointment that this golden opportunity was overlooked. After all, if even the Luther Mahoney story arc saw a measure of 'closure', I believe poor Adena Watson deserved it even more.

1977910,5,B00018YCJ6,"Barry Levinson puts Baltimore into its true, proper perspective once again in Homicide: Homicide Life on the Street

Barry gets Baltimore. Its ethnicity, neighborhoods, characters, and its history.

Just in his films (e.g. Avalon, Liberty Heights), Barry captures the era, the culture, and the people of Baltimore and Maryland
as a native Baltimorean who was born before 1970 would rememeber.

After moving away from Baltimore 10 years before the series takes place, the focus around Fells Point and Baltimore City
from my youth, brings back a lot of good memories. It also brings back a lot of chuckcles from the ""dead on"" eccentricies of Baltimoreans.

I can tell by the the part the actor plays, what neighborhood the character being portrayed grew up in.

Homicide deals with the dysfunction of city government, overworked and underpaid police office and the stress that
not only effects their performance on the job but their families.

What makes Homicide a fantastic drama is that the crimes they invesitgate do not solely dwell on the victims and the
suspects, but how the detectives deal with crimes that affect their lives eventhough they need to remain emotionally detached
throughout current and past investgations.

I personally feel that the original cast of detectives from the first couple of seasons were the best. I also enjoyed when
local stars of Baltimore played cameo roles in the show. The newer episodes which included Robin Williams and Bruno Kirby
detracted from the series, because their performances were predictable as you knew what to expect from them.

I thought the series went a little too far having John Waters a second time as a criminal being extradited by a 'Law and Order'
member from NYC to Baltimore. I never cared for the ""tie in"" episodes with Law and Order, because I thought it lowered
Homicide to 'Law and Orders' mundane screenplay.

Though I wished the Homicide series never ended, I thought the final epsode, Homicide: The Movie was a complete shock. They killed off
Giardello, which I felt was the mortar that held the show together. One of Yaphett Kotto's best performances.

I've been going through Homicide withdrawls ever since the series ended.

So when I was looking through Amazon, and saw the entire series for under $70, I thought, OK what's wrong...is is used?

To my suprise, it was the entire series with the first two seasons and the remaining seasons in multiple CD cases. After all, I was more interested
in the series, not how it was packed.

1977947,5,B00018YCJ6,"I will warn you that this review contains spoilers.

This is the collection that every ""Homicide: Life on the Street"" fan has been waiting for - and got - back in 2006. For some reason it is being rereleased and repackaged. It includes all 122 episodes of the seven seasons of the original series, the Law and Order cross-over episodes, plus the movie ""Another Homicide"" that aired in February 2000 and was the last we fans ever got to see of our beloved series.

For those of you who are unfamiliar, ""Homicide"" was an original crime drama that aired on NBC between January 1993 and May 1999. It was based on David Simon's book, ""Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets"", which was based upon Simon's experiences in 1988 when he spent a year as a civilian assistant to the Baltimore Police Homicide Unit so that he could document what life was like in a big city homicide squad. His extensive notes, interviews, and observations were eventually published as the book.

Much of the cases chronicled in the first two seasons of the show are adapted from actual events in the book. The first two seasons focus on rookie Tim Bayliss's first case - the murder of 11 year-old Adina Watson whose murder is never solved and haunts him for the duration of the series. The original cast was truly brilliant, but to get a third full season the show's producers had to delete veteran actor Jon Polito (Crosetti) from the cast and pretty up the cast by adding Isabella Hoffman as shift supervisor Megan Russert.

There was an entire episode, perhaps the best of the series, dedicated to detective Crosetti's suicide at the beginning of season three. Crosetti left no note, and apparently had no huge looming problems in his life. He just chose to fill himself with alcohol, tranquilizers, and antidepressants and then throw himself into the Chesapeake rather than return to his job after his vacation, in spite of his deeply held religious beliefs that would make you think this is a choice he would never have made. This is one thing you'll see on Homicide time and time again - the writers are not afraid to leave the tough questions unanswered...forever.

Season four is also great, although two more original castmembers depart - Beau Felton and Stan Bolander. The two additions to the cast include Mike Kellerman, whose boyish, fun-loving exterior hides a cagey and complex detective with a penchant for self destruction. He is transferred from arson to homicide as a result of the help he renders on closing the case of an arson-related homicide when a dead body is found in a burned warehouse. Also, J. H. Brodie, a news cameraman who is fired because he gives a tape showing the attacker of an elderly woman to the police rather than to the station for which he works, is also added to the cast. He is apparently meant to be an analog of David Simon. The only problem is, Simon took great pains to keep himself out of the story while Brodie is constantly included in the plot, making him a somewhat awkward although likeable addition.

By season five, the ""NYPD-Blueing"" of Homicide is becoming a bit more pronounced. Never having stellar ratings, the series was forced by the network to show less detective work and gritty realism and more of the personal lives of the cast members. Still, the episodes are excellent. In this season, Michelle Forbes, the new M.E. with a ""Queen of the Dead"" vibe, speeds into town and becomes involved with Mike Kellerman. Frank Pembleton is shown recovering from the stroke he had at the end of season four and struggling to return to full duty. Elijah Wood stars as a the spoiled sociopath son of a Baltimore judge who believes he can get away with anything, including plotting the murder of his own judge mother. Finally, there is the apparent suicide of a long-since departed detective that turns out to be a murder.

Season six is where things begin to go downhill in the show. At the conclusion of season five it was determined that detectives would rotate between departments. This was used as a vehicle to introduce three largely uninteresting and even unlikeable castmembers - Det. Ballard who actually comes from a Seattle homicide unit, Det. Paul Falsone and Det. Stu Gharty. Falsone always came across as a sneak and Stu Gharty had already been shown up as a coward in an episode from a previous season. Melissa Leo's character, Kay Howard, is now completely evicted from the series. Still, there are some interesting developments. In ""Subway"" Pembleton gets an opportunity to speak with the dead for a change rather than for them. Bayliss, at the ripe old age of 37, decides to explore other facets of his sexuality, much to the surprise of Pembleton. Kellerman's execution/shooting of arch-criminal Luther Mahoney in the previous season leads to all out war between the police and Mahoney's family that ends up in a shootout in the squad room and also with Bayliss taking a bullet for Pembleton. Both Pembleton and Kellerman resign from the force.

Season seven is largely forgettable. Bayliss has converted to Buddhism following his brush with death and becomes ""The Zen Detective"". Giardello's son joins the cast as liason between Baltimore PD and the FBI, although the two look more like brothers than father and son - the age separation is just not there, and neither is any semblance of a believable family connection. Michael Michele joins the cast as ex beauty queen/detective Rene Sheppard and does as good a job of helping this show jump the shark as Ted McGinley could have ever hoped to do.

The main episodes from season seven worth watching include those that wrap up Mike Kellerman's story after his exile at the end of season six - the two parter ""Kellerman P.I"". There are also the episodes that further Tim Bayliss' character development where he is forced to shoot the killer of a Buddhist monk in self defense - ""Zen and the Art of Murder"". The other storyline worth watching involve episodes on the Internet killer, who is released on a technicality but vows to Bayliss that he will kill again. These two storylines - the Internet killer being freed and Tim discovering that he can kill if he has to - collide in the excellent series finale ""Forgive Us Our Trespasses"".

The movie aired about nine months after the series finale and has Giardello running for mayor. He is shot by a man whose son is addicted to drugs who does not like Giardello's stand on drugs as more of a treatment problem than a crime problem. The entire cast from the series - and I mean everybody - shows up in this film. Besides helping solve the case, Pembleton gets to hear one more confession - that of Bayliss admitting to the shooting of the Internet killer and demanding that Pembleton ""bring him in"". This is a crime that Bayliss' heart can get past but his head cannot. As a final revelation, we discover that the dead have ready access to coffee, but not expresso.",1244678400,115,6910,4.722222222222222

1977979,5,B00018YCJ6,"Homicide:  Life in the Street should be considered the most realistic perception of police work depicted on the small or large screen.  It should be perceived as the classic forerunner of all Police depictions on TV or in the Movies.
 For 7 seasons and 122 episodes culminating with a made for TV movie, this series captivated TV audiences.  The main actors who contributed much to this excellent series were Daniel Baldwin, Richard Belzer, Clark Johnson, Yaphet Kotto, Kyle Secor and Andre Braugher.
 Most episodes were indeed set out in the streets of Baltimore where the crimes occurred.  All personal relationships between the detectives were interwoven into each case.  These personal problems and relationships carried on in the theme of the program.
 Homicide's signature standard was the scenes set in the interrogation room.  Detectives Pembleton and Bayliss excelled in solving crimes in this room given the name of ""The Box"".  As ""The Box stood as a symbol in where criminals were essentially forced to make their confessions, ""The Roof"" of the Police Headquarters became a confessional for the Detectives.  Many scenes were filmed on ""The Roof"" of the Police Headquarters in where the Dectectives hashed out thier professional problems as well as their personal problems.  Essentially Attanasio was creating sanctuaries where the essence of series was carried out.
 Also prevalent throughout the series was the rather paternal command of Lt. Al Giardello's handling of this eclectic group of detectives.
 This depiction of police work on the streets of Baltimore held its grip on TV audiences for 7 seasons.  I saw all the episodes as they were aired.  When I bought this complete DVD set, I saw things I did not see the first time.  With no commercial interruptions, I was able to better understand the full concept of what Paul Attanasio was trying to convey.

1977987,5,B00018YCJ6,"Never a ratings-beater, ""Homicide"" was still, for six and a half years, the best thing on network TV. Credit NBC for carrying the show as long as it did, a rare recent instance of a network getting behind a critically-lauded show. (If ""Homicide"" premiered today, it would be gone in a season, or less.) ""Homicide"" boasted one of the finest ensemble casts ever assembled for a series: Richard Belzer (who carries his role forward on ""Law and Order: SVU""), the great Yaphet Kotto, Kyle Secor, Clark Johnson, Melissa Leo, Reed Diamond, Jon Seda, Callie Thorne, Isabella Hofmann, Zeljko Ivanek, Ned Beatty, Daniel Baldwin, Giancarlo Esposito, Jon Polito and the man who just might be the best actor in America, Andre Braugher.

The show, executive produced by Baltimorean Barry Levinson, took off from David Simon's superb book chronicling a year in the lives of the city's homicide squad, and seldom has an author been better served by another medium. (Simon also worked as a story editor.) The characters are not based on their real-life counterparts so much as suggested by them, but some of their investigations were replicated, most especially the inquiry into the murder of a young girl, which kicked off the show's first episode. The unsolved mystery surrounding ""Adena Watson"" carried through the show as a kind of thematic mantra, haunting Detective Tim Bayliss right up to the final two-hour series finale movie. ""Three Men and Adena,"" the episode-long interrogation of the prime suspect, played in a scorching, indelible turn by the late Moses Gunn, was the first great episode of the series, the one that grabbed you by the lapels and said, in essence, keep watching, kiddo -- this is not your father's cop show.

What set ""Homicide"" off from such enjoyable but rather schematic shows as ""Law and Order"" was its accent, not on arrest and trial, but on the process of detection -- the way these men and women approached a murder and worried its elements like dogs on a particularly knotty bone. That, and the relationships between the detectives, added to the gritty, hand-held, jump-cut look and feel of it, helped made ""Homicide"" the wonder it was at its best... which was most of the time. Its writers (which included Paul Attanasio, Tom Fontana, James Yoshimura, the splendid playwright Eric Overmyer, Simon, and even Kotto) were never content to set up whodunits; their writing probed beneath the skin, and was often staggeringly effective. It caught (within the limits of network censorship) the realities of police speech, the dark and resigned gallows humor that attended the investigation, and the neuroses of the characters so perfectly that much of the show's dialogue would not have been out of place in a great work of theatre.

The ""guest star"" list is enormously impressive, and ultimately included Lily Tomlin, a very young Jake Gyllenhall, Steve Allen and Jayne Meadows, Austin Pendleton, Edie Falco, Pamela Payton-Wright, Hazelle Goodman, Al Freeman Jr., Dana Ivey, Tony Lo Bianco, Mekhi Phifer, James Earl Jones, the great Lynne Thigpen, Jeffrey Wright, Baltimore native John Waters (twice, in different roles), Joe Morton, Carolyn McCormick, Anne Meara, Vincent D'Onofrio, and a pre-""SVU"" Christopher Meloni. And while ""Homicide"" was most definitely an ensemble piece, in some curious way it followed two, not always parallel, arcs, becoming in effect the stories of Secor's Bayliss and Braugher's Frank Pembleton. Indeed, beginning as it did with Tim's arrival and ending with his ultimate leave-taking, both of which are inextricably bound up in the life and death of Adena Watson, the series is almost the Bayliss' story, and he is arguably the one character who alters the most, mentally, spiritually, philosophically and even sexually.

If there is a single problematic casting element in ""Homicide,"" it's the implausibility of a man as dark-skinned as Yaphet Kotto as Giadello, the squad's black/Italian lieutenant -- when Giancarlo Esposito joined the cast as Giadello's son, you realized he looked the way Giadello should. Yet Kotto's is such a commanding, affecting presence it almost doesn't matter. (The ""real"" Giadello, Gary D'Addario, served as a technical advisor to the series and played in a dozen episodes.) I doubt Barry Levinson will ever write and direct a movie as good as this show. But then, neither will anyone else.",1193270400,4,4367,5.137834036568214

This goes beyond mere ""television"", in fact, this is what television should aspire to be.  How else can you explain the fact that the most gritty and realistic cop show in TV history is also one of the most bloodless?  The answer is simple, it is simply that cerebral.  Every episodes features several moments that to fully appreciate one must actually think, instead of merely blink and admire the eye candy as so many other shows seem to have seen as the route to success.  Instead Homicide simply produced the most compelling television, we should feel blessed that we were able to enjoy this.  Is anyone really surprised that David Simon went on to be associated with a show as great as The Wire?  Couldn't we see the writing on the wall?  The people involved in this show (particularly Andre Braugher) were simply astoundingly good.  Get this.  Just get it.

1978012,5,B00018YCJ6,"The standard of American television these days is excellent.  Not good, not fair, not OK but truly outstanding.  CSI, The Shield, the sadly departed Sopranos, Lost and Heroes - all fantastic.

Homicide Life on the Street, I think set the standard for American drama.  I feel that the most recent American television owes a small debt to Homicide, which began in the 1990s.

Even though Homicide at the time was not delivering the viewer numbers the network wished and wanted, it still had a following that thrived on the quality of the show and notably the characters.  (Unfortunately, the tv network in Britain that aired the show commonly played around with the time and dates of airing and it never really had the following in Blighty that it really deserved).

Homicide had it all - Barry Levinson and his love of Baltimore, good scripts (the interaction between the characters is almost like early Tarantino), excellent cast, great guest directors, but most of all Yaphet Kotto as Giardello who endeavours to keep the red names on the whiteboard, his colesterol and the bosses uptstairs all in check.

From the 90s until now, as the quality of American drama has excelled, without Homicide, X-Files and the early seasons of ER, would we have the likes of 24, The Shield, Lost, CSI?

Americans be proud. Homicide is American police drama at its best.  In England, police television drama has been a baron wastleland since Helen Mirren graced Prime Suspect.  All we have now is The Bill (which I think is a straightfaced joke at the expense of our London Police Constabulary) and Heartbeat (a policeman cycling on his bike through the countryside in 1960s England) - I sincerely wish I was joking about these shows (as I have a sense of national pride), but unfortunately I am serious.

There are few, if any, happy endings. The cops are shown with all of their weaknesses and fallibilities intact.

1978016,5,B00018YCJ6,"I loved Homicide during its NBC run.  The dingy offices, plain-Jane actors with cheap suits and frequent failures to convict or capture or obtain confessions really rang true.

Homicide was the opposite of NYPD Blue, showcasing Baltimore, a very distant second to New York; eschewing sexy nudity scenes for clautrophobic interrogations in The Box; delving deeply into dirty politics at the top of the Baltimore PD hierarchy.

The use of deliberately shaky and shifty camera work signified the chaotic and pressure filled work of the murder police. Homicide is the parent of HBO's The Wire, also set in Baltimore and even grittier and grimmer than its elder.

This Megaset is a great treasure.  Every single Homicide episode, including the Law & Order cross-overs and the made for TV movie are included.  The box is a cleverly designed file cabinet with index cards to separate the various Season DVDs.

Baltimore was getting better for a time but Since Mayor now Governor O'Malley left Baltimore is slowly sinking becoming again the same cold hearted, murder mill, slaughterhouse comedy it used to be.  Homocide life on the streets faithfully told blood soaked stories of abject stupidity some Baltimorons live with a gun toting professional apomb second to none.  Among the vast well dressed expensive car driving largely abeit uneducated upper crust of Baltimore's murderous street smart ghetto elite IQ's, never equal or exceed the caliber of weapon used plying their art of death.  Baltimore's disgarded dime a dozen ignorant youth use Baltimore streets to engage in a drug crazed death sport of mindless fun and frolics for scant druggie profits that assure Baltimore streets will remain awash in a seemingly endless sea of red glistening blood, white heavy chalk lines, and flashing blue police lights until the center of Hell swallows the city whole.

Homocide life on the streets does a pretty good job of capturing the basic rank horror of Baltimore urban thugged out street life.  Homocide Life on the Streets also captures on DVD the quirky odd ball Balmer Maryland Hon Red Neck angst and Proud Black Blue collar working men that together are the backbone of this city set in a ever violent 7th pit of hell.  Baltimore is a nice city in a Urban Ghetto Fabulous sort of way and Homocide Life On the Streets shows the contrast between Baltimore's Ghetto want-to-be big city glitz juxtaposed against Baltimore's tiny town blue collar southern down home old bpoy roots.  Unfortunately it is impossible to show on film how truly amazingly stupid mindless and senseless the violence on Baltimore streets really is but Homocide Life on the Streets tries and succeeds right well.  Problem is the true picture of Baltimore violence is too insane to be believed, by sane thinking folk in the rest of the country.  Script writers could not imagine the strange sicko psycho things that breed a rampant disrespect for human life that is an everyday occurance in Baltimore for real.  If any writer did accurately imagine how pathetic Baltimorons are when it comes to having the most basic civilized respect for human life their scripts would be considered as real logical and believable as a Salavdor Daly painting featuring those melting clocks.

I brought Homocide Life on the Streets the entire show all nine seasonsbecause, it did a good job of capturing nice chunks but by no means all of Baltimore's continuing raging insanity on video.  If you like watching a city gone wild buy Homocide Life on the Streets.  Trust me watching the sanitized Baltimore of Homocide Life on the Streets on TV is the next best thing to living \ dying here.  Baltimore should have a new slogan...

1978047,5,B00018YCJ6,"David Simon, the creator of HBO's ""The Wire"" and one of the brains behind ""Homicide: Life on the Street"", was asked recently why the ""The Wire"" has never had high ratings in the USA, despite getting mad love from the critics. His response was blunt. He put the show's poor ratings down to the fact that ""The Wire"" has a predominantly black cast, the unglamorous Baltimore setting and the fact that The Wire ""requires thought and commitment to watch and absorb complex plotlines and subtleties. Television in America is by and large a vegetative medium.""

I believe ""Homicide: Life on the Street"" was similarly affected. With all due respect to its citizens, the Fells Point district of Baltimore where this series is shot is not a particularly pretty part of the city and, with a sizable black population, it's inevitable that the vast majority of people the Baltimore murder police are likely to come across are going to be African American. I find it sad but can totally understand why that might not be what most people want to tune in on an evening to see - or indeed, later pay money to see on DVD. When you look at ""CSI: Miami"" for instance, (reportedly the most popular TV series in the world at the moment), you can immediately see the vast disparity between the two. Everything about that show is about glamour: the city settings, the big houses and big fast cars and everyone totally buff and beautiful. It's escapism at its best in that it bears little or no resemblance to reality. But in this age of superficiality and celebrity mania, I'm guessing this is what most folks are up for.

But I believe such folks are missing out. If ""Homicide"" is anything, it's realistic. This season was the first to have a full 22 episodes. The storylines are tense, gripping and real. The hand-held camerawork gives it the feel of a documentary. Even though the producers dropped Daniel Baldwin and Ned Beatty, brought in Reed Diamond and had Isabelle Hoffman's character demoted back to detective to, presumably, up the 'babe' factor of the cast, this is still by and large a collection of very ordinary looking but incredibly talented actors. I think that's one of the main reasons why it works for me. It's a completely rewarding experience and, after watching an entire season, I can very easily start again from the first episode and still get a lot of enjoyment out of it.

I don't wish to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it yet but we have fires, snipers, a wife who kills her husband (and the woman he was cheating on her with), drug wars, a ""thrill killer"" working his way up the I-95, a homophobic hate crime gone wrong, a child killed by a paedophile and any manner of murder mayhem. There are star appearances from people like Lily Tomlin, Chris Rock, Jay Leno, Marcia Gay Harden and Gary Basaraba. And in a slick crossover with Season 6 of ""Law & Order"", we get an appearance from members of the cast, including Jerry Orbach, Benjamin Bratt, S. Epatha Merkerson, Sam Waterston and Jill Hennesy. The brilliant Max Perlich also guest stars as the squads new video man, Brodie.

Andre Braugher's wife Abi Brabson (who plays detective Pembleton's wife Mary in the show) gives birth to their baby towards the end of the season and to give Braugher time to spend with his newborn child, the producers cleverly decide to give him a stroke. It works in another way: Pembleton is easily the most accomplished detective on the squad, (a fact he makes sure everyone around him is acutely aware of), and it will be interesting in the coming season/s to see him have to work his way back up to any practical level of competency.

DVD extras include commentary on ""The Hat"", the episode starring Lily Tomlin, scene selection, interactive menus, song listings (a tool I've found very useful indeed) and a short documentary, ""Homicide: Life in Season 4"" narrated by Isabella Hoffman and featuring interviews with Barry Levinson, Tom Fontana, Henry Bromwell, David Simon and James Yoshimura.

The only thing I would've really liked that wasn't included was subtitles. Some of the terminologies go right over my head and it sometimes helps to see them in writing.

1978069,5,B00018YCJ6,"What a great show! I have been a huge fan of ""Homicide: Life on the Street"" since it originally aired on NBC. In fact during the '90s, HLOTS was the one show that was ""appointment TV"" for me. (I regularly taped new episodes, since it was on Friday nights and I was often out due to being single & in my 20s.) HLOTS still rates as my favorite network series of all time (closely behind my all-time fav show, ""Homicide's"" grittier 'younger brother', HBO's ""The Wire"" - the best show on TV).

What made this show so good were the intelligent writing and the great acting. Unlike most cop shows, it focused on character development of the detectives, instead of on gunfights and car chases. The actors looked like cops, not like models.  The show was more about the inner workings of the ""murder police"", than it was the crimes themselves. And the cases weren't conveniently solved at the end of each episode. In fact, many of the cases were remained unsolved. It is far more realistic than the standard cop show (like the ridiculously phony CSI franchise).

HLOTS featured one of the strongest casts ever on network television, led by the outstanding Andre Braugher.  It also featured many guest starring appearances by outstanding actors like James Earl Jones, Robin Williams, Steve Buscemi, Edie Falco, Isaiah Washington, Lily Tomlin, Steve Allen, and many, many more.

""Homicide"" was also ground breaking in its fast paced editing, with lots of Jump cuts. The show was shot (especially the earlier seasons) to have the look & feel of a documentary.  Much of the early shows were shot with hand held cameras using 16mm film.  It's not as obvious now (because so many shows have since adopted this style), but this show looked like nothing else on TV in 1993.

Like some others who have posted, I already owned some the individual sets (Seasons 1&2, Season 3, and Season 4.)  However, it was actually cheaper to buy the mega-set than to buy even 2 of the 3 seasons I didn't already own. Plus, as noted above, the mega-set includes a bonus disc with the ""Law & Order"" cross over episodes and the now out of print ""Homicide: the Movie."" And the packaging is very cool!  The individual seasons had somewhat the look of case files.  The mega-set takes this theme to a new level, packaging the sets in a sturdy File Cabinet box, with ""tabs"" separating each season's ""file"".

The show looks great on DVD, has great sound, and each season features commentary on one episode plus some type of ""behind the scenes"" feature.  Of particular note is the Season 6 set which includes the outstanding PBS documentary ""Anatomy of a Homicide"".  These extras give great insight on how the show came together.

I only have a couple of very minor complaints. Seasons 1-4 include song listings for each episode (music was featured prominently on the series). Starting with Season 5, the song listings are dropped.  But, Seasons 5-7 include the ""Previously On..."" content that originally aired with the episodes.  It would be nice to have both the song listings AND the ""previously ons"" for all the seasons. But this is how the discs were originally packaged for the individual season sets. Also, in a perfect world, it would be nice to have the L&O episodes on the same discs as the corresponding HLOTS episodes.  But I know that it would be unrealistic to expect A&E to make new discs for this set, since they were just repackaging the existing discs into a new set.

Bottom line, if you've never seen ""Homicide"", but you like intelligent drama, great writing, and superb acting, check it out! And if you're a fan of the show, you already know how good it is, so get it already! Either way, I highly recommend getting this set.

(NBC often showed episodes out of order, making a show built around story arcs confusing.)  With the possible exception of Season 7's ""A Case Of Dor Or Die"", which from my memory was originally shown out of order and appears here in the same spot, it appears correct.

There is a commentary track on one episode of each season.  Plus, there is a bonus disc with the Homicide Life everlasting movie as well as the three Law & Order crossover episodes.  Fans of Homicide need to take this case.  Simply put, this is the complete Homicide.

An an note, the commentary tracks do provide some interesting stories, including the two cast members who absolutely despised each other and how an episode is a mixture of hard work and personality clashes.",1174780800,5,882,4.6688311688311686
1978072,5,B00018YCJ6,"I heard so much praise about this show but I never saw a single episode. I knew Tom Fontana was involved so it had to be good. I'm a HUGE fan of HBO's Oz which Fontana was involved in as well.

One day, I saw one episode on TV and I was in awe. I completely fell in love with the show and started watching it anytime I could.

I only saw a couple more episodes before I decided to just go ahead and buy the whole collection, and I'm so glad that I did. The show is definitely worth it.

It's extremely well written and beautifully acted. It is very realistic. You get your regular cases that get solved right away without any twists and turns that you see in all the other cop shows on TV. You get your impossible cases that take a few episodes with the detectives investigating and they might not find the killer, and the case remains unsolved.

The show is mainly about the detectives themselves more than the cases. It is very realistic and entertaining to watch. The characters are very intriguing and very well written.

1978091,5,B00018YCJ6,"Even though the series has been off the air for going on eight years, ""Homicide"" is still very popular with serious web discussion forums of this series still going on.

This is the collection that every ""Homicide: Life on the Street"" fan has been waiting for. It include all 122 episodes of the seven seasons of the original series, the Law and Order cross-over episodes, plus the movie ""Another Homicide"" that aired in February 2000 and was the last we fans ever got to see of our beloved series. Also, it is much more reasonably priced than the other DVD collections of ""Homicide"" available up to now. The movie isn't even available on DVD.

For those of you who are unfamiliar, ""Homicide"" was an original crime drama that aired on NBC between January 1993 and May 1999. It was based on David Simon's book, ""Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets"", which was based upon Simon's experiences in 1988 when he spent a year as a civilian assistant to the Baltimore Police Homicide Unit so that he could document what life was like in a big city homicide squad. His extensive notes, interviews, and observations were eventually published as the book.

Much of the cases chronicled in the first two seasons of the show are adapted from actual events in the book. The first two seasons focus on rookie Tim Bayliss's first case - the murder of 11 year-old Adina Watson whose murder is never solved and haunts him for the duration of the series. The original cast was truly brilliant, but to get a third full season the show's producers had to delete veteran actor Jon Polito (Crosetti) from the cast and pretty up the cast by adding Isabella Hoffman as shift supervisor Megan Russert.

There was an entire episode, perhaps the best of the series, dedicated to detective Crosetti's suicide at the beginning of season three. Crosetti left no note, and apparently had no huge looming problems in his life. He just chose to fill himself with alcohol, tranquilizers, and antidepressants and then throw himself into the Chesapeake rather than return to his job after his vacation, in spite of his deeply held religious beliefs that would make you think this is a choice he would never have made. This is one thing you'll see on Homicide time and time again - the writers are not afraid to leave the tough questions unanswered...forever.

Season four is also great, although two more original castmembers depart - Beau Felton and Stan Bolander. The two additions to the cast include Mike Kellerman, whose boyish, fun-loving exterior hides a cagey and complex detective with a penchant for self destruction. He is transferred from arson to homicide as a result of the help he renders on closing the case of an arson-related homicide when a dead body is found in a burned warehouse. Also, J. H. Brodie, a news cameraman who is fired because he gives a tape showing the attacker of an elderly woman to the police rather than to the station for which he works, is also added to the cast. He is apparently meant to be an analog of David Simon. The only problem is, Simon took great pains to keep himself out of the story while Brodie is constantly included in the plot, making him a somewhat awkward although likeable addition.

By season five, the ""NYPD-Blueing"" of Homicide is becoming a bit more pronounced. Never having stellar ratings, the series was forced by the network to show less detective work and gritty realism and more of the personal lives of the cast members. Still, the episodes are excellent. In this season, Michelle Forbes, the new M.E. with a ""Queen of the Dead"" vibe, speeds into town and becomes involved with Mike Kellerman. Frank Pembleton is shown recovering from the stroke he had at the end of season four and struggling to return to full duty. Elijah Wood stars as a the spoiled sociopath son of a Baltimore judge who believes he can get away with anything, including plotting the murder of his own judge mother. Finally, there is the apparent suicide of a long-since departed detective that turns out to be a murder.

Season six is where things begin to go downhill in the show. At the conclusion of season five it was determined that detectives would rotate between departments. This was used as a vehicle to introduce three largely uninteresting and even unlikeable castmembers - Det. Ballard who actually comes from a Seattle homicide unit, Det. Paul Falsone and Det. Stu Gharty. Falsone always came across as a sneak and Stu Gharty had already been shown up as a coward in an episode from a previous season. Melissa Leo's character, Kay Howard, is now completely evicted from the series. Still, there are some interesting developments. In ""Subway"" Pembleton gets an opportunity to speak with the dead for a change rather than for them. Bayliss, at the ripe old age of 37, decides to explore other facets of his sexuality, much to the surprise of Pembleton. Kellerman's execution/shooting of arch-criminal Luther Mahoney in the previous season leads to all out war between the police and Mahoney's family that ends up in a shootout in the squad room and also with Bayliss taking a bullet for Pembleton. Both Pembleton and Kellerman resign from the force.

Season seven is largely forgettable. Bayliss has converted to Buddhism following his brush with death and becomes ""The Zen Detective"". Giardello's son joins the cast as liason between Baltimore PD and the FBI, although the two look more like brothers than father and son - the age separation is just not there, and neither is any semblance of a believable family connection. Michael Michele joins the cast as ex beauty queen/detective Rene Sheppard and does as good a job of helping this show jump the shark as Ted McGinley could have ever hoped to do.

The main episodes from season seven worth watching include those that wrap up Mike Kellerman's story after his exile at the end of season six - the two parter ""Kellerman P.I"". There are also the episodes that further Tim Bayliss' character development where he is forced to shoot the killer of a Buddhist monk in self defense - ""Zen and the Art of Murder"". The other storyline worth watching involve episodes on the Internet killer, who is released on a technicality but vows to Bayliss that he will kill again. These two storylines - the Internet killer being freed and Tim discovering that he can kill if he has to - collide in the excellent series finale ""Forgive Us Our Trespasses"".

The movie aired about nine months after the series finale and has Giardello running for mayor. He is shot by a man whose son is addicted to drugs who does not like Giardello's stand on drugs as more of a treatment problem than a crime problem. The entire cast from the series - and I mean everybody - shows up in this film. Besides helping solve the case, Pembleton gets to hear one more confession - that of Bayliss admitting to the shooting of the Internet killer and demanding that Pembleton ""bring him in"". This is a crime that Bayliss' heart can get past but his head cannot. As a final revelation, we discover that the dead have ready access to coffee, but not expresso.",1159574400,171,7091,4.729773462783172
1978092,5,B00018YCJ6,"Season 4 of ""Homicide"" is truly great television, but it is missing two things that season three had - detectives Beau Felton and Stan Bolander. Unlike Detective Crosetti's character, whose death is the subject of an entire episode that was arguably the best of the entire series, Beau and Stan are merely mentioned to have caused an embarrassing episode at a convention and given 22 week suspensions because of this. In fact, the last chance the series would have had to write the characters out of the show properly would have been the last episode of season three. However, it is obvious from that episode - ""The Gas Man"" - that the show's creators thought that the series would not be renewed for a fourth season and just decided to write a very good off-beat episode for that finale. Thus, this omission can be somewhat forgiven.

Given that now three detectives are missing from the original cast, the season opener is a two-parter that introduces the audience to Mike Kellerman. Bayliss and Pembleton are called out to investigate an arson-related homicide when a dead body is found in a burned warehouse and wind up working with detective Kellerman of arson. We soon learn beneath the boyish, fun-loving exterior is a cagey and complex detective. We will also see that Reed Diamond, the actor who plays Kellerman, has real depth and emotion to him as well. We soon learn that Kellerman is good at his job when he beats the homicide detectives to both the medical examiner and Missing Persons. When he manages to trick a confession out of the murderer at the conclusion of the two parter, he is offered a job in homicide and is partnered with Lewis. The complexity of Kellerman's character is meant to be part of the ""new Homicide"" with more storyline given to the personal lives of the characters from this point forward in the series.

Another character, Brodie, is added to the cast in ""Autofocus"". In this episode, the detectives get help from news cameraman J.H. Brodie, who has the killer of an elderly woman on tape entirely by accident and then spends a good deal of the episode trying to convince the detectives that he has something worth watching. Naturally, he has a price--he wants an exclusive on the arrest of the killers. Eventually he does get this but it is not enough to save his job. The higher-ups at his TV station are far more focused on getting an exclusive than they are on solving a crime. When Brodie gives this up he is promptly fired.  It's pretty clear that Brodie was meant to be a version of David Simon, the man who spent a year on the killing streets and wrote the original book. But where Simon stayed outside of the story in his book, Brodie keeps stepping into it on the series. It is impossible to pretend (like the detectives do) that he isn't there but we're never sure what to make of him.

Another major change that  occurs in `Autofocus' is  Howard is being promoted to Sergeant. Unfortunately, in the book, it was made very clear that a sergeant's role was mostly office work, although they are allowed to go out on cases. This is the reason that the sergeants were written out of the series when the show premiered. And since there is already one office bound leader (Giardello) there would seem to be less for Howard to do. Howard gets squeezed between these two extremes and as a result would have almost no presence on the show for the next two years- not being called out on cases, or allowed to supervise. It's a great pity, because as this episode illustrates there was a lot that could have been done exploring Howard's character as she dealt with the challenges of her new job - how she deals with it and how others deal working with a former friend. Instead, Howard was all but eliminated, a sad fate for Melissa Leo who was such a vital part of the show for its first three years on the air.

""Sniper"" is an excellent two parter in which someone is randomly picking off citizens of Baltimore and using the game of hangman to clue in the police. Throughout this ""red ball"" case, the detectives are worn down to the nub working around the clock. This case sounds formulaic now, but remember that this was seven years before the DC sniper case. In the beginning of that actual case some people speculated that the snipers were imitating this episode of Homicide. Ultimately, Russert makes the decision to send Bayliss in to talk to the sniper rather than sending in the SWAT team, once the sniper is identified through the brand of chalk he is using, and this leads to the sniper killing himself. The solving of the case is somewhat formulaic, but the fallout of the case leads to Russert's demotion to regular detective, setting up some good moments in the rest of the season where Isabella Hoffman is finally given something to do.

""Stakeout"" is a series classic that is somewhat like season one's ""Night of the Dead Living"" where we see that detective work can often be very dull. In the space of twenty four hours we find the identity of a serial killer from one of the thickest criminals on the show. Arrested for narcotic possession and stolen property, he confesses that he was involved with ten murders. He thinks that because he didn't actually kill any of the victims he is less liable which proves as Bayliss puts it ""Crime makes you stupid"" The killer is en route from a trip back to Baltimore, so the Homicide unit sets up a stakeout in the house next door. So two detectives go there. And they wait. Three hours later the shift changes. And they wait. Every three hours, they change partners until twenty-four hours later when the killer is arrested in his driveway without incident. During the course of that time, they identify several of the dead bodies, arrest an accomplice who agrees to testify against the killer and build-up an air-tight case. So the investigation is actually the least interesting part of the show. What makes `Stakeout' one of the highlights of the season is the emotional baggage that some of the detectives are carrying and that they unload while they try to pass the time. Part of this is expressed very well in the characters of George and Cathy Buxton, the people who own the house the detectives are using for surveillance. During the stakeout, the Buxtons argue, the husband storms out, the two make up, and their marriage returns to what passes for normal.

The season finale, ""Work Related"",  has a very unexpected ending as Pembleton almost dies while interrogating a suspect in the box in what for the first half of the episode seems like a very ordinary hour of TV. He is almost felled by a silent killer that he doesn't even know is on his trail. His fate is left up in the air waiting for the next year's season opener.

In conclusion, I think that this fourth season of ""Homicide"" is still a five-star season, but it is just not up to the six star genius of the first three seasons. There are many brilliant individual episodes I haven't mentioned, and the acting and writing are still top-notch, but the ""NYPD-Blueing"" of the series is beginning to creep in at this point ever so faintly. Gone are the less physically attractive members of the original cast who probably didn't have personal lives that would attract younger viewers, and more and more personal elements of the detectives' lives are being incorporated into the storyline. However, the series is still must-see TV until the departure of Andre Braugher - the heart of the cast - at the end of season six and the redecoration of the squad room with soft pastels at the beginning of season seven that leaves it looking like a travel agency.",1159488000,2,7619,4.627958579881657
