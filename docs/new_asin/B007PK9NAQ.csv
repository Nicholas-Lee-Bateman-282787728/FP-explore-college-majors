8520476,4,B007PK9NAQ,"There's one very good reason to watch THE COAST PATROL (Barsky,1925), and that's Fay Wray. Before becoming the screen's foremost distressed damsel, Fay acted in silent westerns and two-reel comedies, finally landing her big break in Erich von Stroheim's masterwork, THE WEDDING MARCH (Paramount,1928). She was soon one of Hollywood's most popular actresses, reaching her peak in the immortal classic, KING KONG (RKO,1933).

THE COAST PATROL, directed by I. J. ""Bud"" Barsky, was the nearly 18 year old Fay's feature film debut, and already she displays the endearing qualities which graced all of her later work. Here, she's the idealistic, tomboyish daughter of an old lighthouse keeper (Spottiswoode Aitken) who is seduced by the leader of a gang of smugglers (Gino Corrado) operating off the coast of Massachusetts. Kenneth McDonald is the government agent who finally saves the day and wins the beauteous Fay.

Independently produced by Barsky on a shoe-string budget, THE COAST PATROL is interesting because of its outdoor photography at an actual seaside village. Aside from some over the top dramatics by Spottiswoode Aitken, the acting is adequate, with Fay Wray's sensitive performance taking the honors.

Alpha's DVD of THE COAST PATROL  is a bit contrasty, but it's the best version I've seen and is complete. The piano score is appropriate and adds to the film's atmosphere.

As a Fay Wray fan myself, I'd recommend THE COAST PATROL to anyone else who's interested in seeing this legendary star at the very beginning of her career.

UPDATE: January 28th, 2018

Grapevine Video's DVD-R of THE COAST PATROL is of significantly improved quality with a piano score composed for the film by David Knudson. An upgrade from the Alpha is highly recommended.",1378339200,2,1760,5.1978798586572434
8520477,4,B007PK9NAQ,"Some people love snails with butter and garlic, salivate over pineapple chunks on pizza (such a doleful abomination), inhale Big Macs and fries.  No accounting for taste, I guess, but one person's vile vittles is another's gourmet meal.  So too with movies, especially those from the silent era, which are for many people an acquired taste.  If you love the silents in general and the lovely Ms. Wray in particular then you want to add this movie to your collection.  It's not the greatest movie of the era, certainly, but it has its charms, and of course, Ms. Wray: so young and so darned cute.  She lights up the screen, as the saying goes, and it quickly becomes obvious why this lovely actress had such a long, illustrious career.  In ""Coast Patrol"" it's a wolf rather than a gorilla that threatens the fair damsel, but she survives and lives to charm another day.

The print isn't the best, but it's acceptable.  And, if nothing else, you'll get an easy-to-swallow tutorial on the cultural history of the United States of America.  Fay Wray and movie making, juveniles both, both just starting out.  Children at play, and we get to watch, enthralled and a little envious.",1356393600,3,1176,4.720588235294118
8520478,4,B007PK9NAQ,"This film shines for the simple reason that it was Fay Wray's first leading role, and because I'm a huge Fay Wray fan, I just had to have it.  The movie is just OK with some expected hamming it up by the lead actors, but everything comes alive when Fay is on screen.  This is a different part for her for those only familiar with her horror work, as she plays a tom-boyish girl.

The print itself is not great, but I'm glad to at least have a version available..",1354492800,,462,4.111111111111111
