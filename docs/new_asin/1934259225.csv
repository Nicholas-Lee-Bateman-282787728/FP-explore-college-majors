8324506,5,1934259225,"The product description states that the 2 DVD set was, ""Developed as an adjunct to the award winning book, THE GRAPE GROWER, these videos take you step-by-step in pruning dormant grapevines to teach you how to prune any grape vine in any situation..."" That's exactly what the DVD's do. The DVD's are an excellent adjunct to the book, which is a great book. The theory is well presented in the book and the videos show you the practice of it. It's rather like standing over the author's shoulder as he shows you what he is doing and why he is doing it.

High production value, good information. Thanks to Mr. Rombough for sharing his thorough knowledge.",1242000000,,652,4.620689655172414
