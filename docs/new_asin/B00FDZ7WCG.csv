8614596,4,B00FDZ7WCG,"I have been a fan of westerns all my life.  Whether it was the old television cowboys like The Cisco Kid, Roy Rogers, and The Lone Ranger, or the westerns I saw at the movie theater, I enjoyed all of them. I picked up this 20 Movies Western Vengeance: twenty tales of retribution for a real bargain price.  Actually, I bought this DVD because it had One-Eyed Jacks with Marlon Brando and Karl Malden in it.  This was always an underrated western which I thought had everything you would want in western story.

I also enjoyed many of the other nineteen movies in this collection.  The following are some of the westerns in this collection: Day of the Wolves, Deadwood 76, Boot Hill, Yuma, Kid Vengeance, Dead Aim, Rawhide, Savage guns, Cry Apache and Buffalo Stampede.
If you like revenge western movies you might want to check out the collection in this DVD.

Rating: 4 Stars.  Joseph J. Truncale (Author: The Samurai Soul: An old warriors poetic tribute).",1405036800,2,957,4.660714285714286
