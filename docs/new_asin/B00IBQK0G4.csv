8640744,4,B00IBQK0G4,"As noted by the two earlier reviewers this is a DVD of a public television program.  It is nicely done with good sound and clear video.  It would have been better had there been subtitles for many arias/songs sung in German, however anyone interested in Operetta will recognize most of the offerings and I suspect the translations are readily available on-line.  At the time I write this review Amazon notes that the DVD as ""unavailable.""  However it is readily available from non Amazon sources.",1501545600,,496,4.869047619047619
