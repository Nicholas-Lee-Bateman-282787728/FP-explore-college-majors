We learn more of Ed and Al's past, but new enemies and events emerge while old ones become allies to some extent.

There are alot of emotional rides in the second box. But to tell the truth, the end of the second box makes me ache from waiting for the 2nd season, or the 3rd box set to come out. this is one series I AM resolute to finish collecting.

As ~I said in my review with the first box, I had an affinity with Dragonball, because of my Chinese roots, I have watched it as a child, from the innocent young Goku series, to his adulthood.

On top of this, they discover the mystery of Lab 5, where chimeras are imprisoned. They also find the Homonculus--undead human beings who are willing to kill millions of people just so they can become human again. Ed get forced into the toughest situation of his life--a situation even worse than his near-death experience with Scar.

The animation is better than ever in this series. In fact, this is the perfect series for anyone. Even though there is violence, the anime exposes the true costs of war and genocide. Although the death of hundreds of people never makes for an equivalent exchange, plenty of politicians today are probably willing to do anything to get what they want.

It's about time there was a series that raised these questions. I love the anime's straightforward approach to these questions. There are very few series that are willing to cut lengthy battles, and this one sets the fighting sequences at just the right timing to save time for excellent dialogue.

And the tragedy is well-paced. Of course, death is horrific, and this series saves time for heart-wrenching grieving scenes. I don't think I've ever seen a series this perfect in my life...That's no lie.",1200355200,,1336,4.898230088495575

2967188,5,B000WE5I1U,"Well, like with every thing you buy from animation you obviously have to wait until the commercial is over -glares at commercials with loathing- My friend introduced me to Fullmetal Alchemist and I immediately fell in love -watched it first in Japanese though by accident and then English, either way it was great- Vic Mignona does a great job (like always) with Edward Elric's voice. This part continues off with the first season part one, they take Al back to get fixed up, Armstrong (greatest posing comic relief ever with his sparkling personality and muscles XD) enjoying the view and marveling and brotherly bonding. Its a great series and I'm so glad to finally own it, I've become quite the anime/manga addict of late and like always FMA has the deepest of plots compared to a lot of things we see today on t.v. Not dissing on any particular show or movie -cough twi cough light-, but this plot is so awesome, kind of like a mix between the legend of Faust/Frankenstein/Odysseus together. Faust being the alchemy and the deal with the devil going on, basically doing something for his success (Ed's travels gain his success). Frankenstein, obviously Al, he turned his brother into a monster and in that act it was going against nature. Odysseus, they're trying to make it back home through trials that will test their manhood. And through it all even when Ed is tempted to do wrong and break the laws of science for his own benefit he never does because he knows it would mean sacrificing something or someone. -wags brows- Team Edward all the way... Edward Elric that is! XD Hope you enjoy it!",1284422400,,1602,4.704626334519573

2967202,5,B000WE5I1U,I would recommend fullmetal for anyone who is looking for a new anime to watch.  I got interested in it when I saw a preview of the first show.  This is my opinion is one of the best out of the box sets though and the book you get in each box have good draws and artwork.,1219449600,,271,3.736842105263158
2967203,5,B000WE5I1U,"Recieved fast, even with the distance between the shipper and myself, only problem was that I recieved 2 disk 8's and no disk 9, probably a manufacture error.",1217808000,,158,4.678571428571429
2967204,5,B000WE5I1U,"Even though the series has been over for a while now and the movie has come out, I am still a very big FMA fan (as well as a Bleach fan, though it's not as good as fma).
Now, this box set covers episodes 17-28 (3 disks). Ed reunites with the Rockbells (since Scar destroyed his automail), discoveres how the Philosopher's stone is made, battles in Laboratory 5, sees his ""fave teacher"" Izumi, gets shipped off to Yock Island, and discovers a mysterious boy with unhuman powers.
First of all, this set is not a good starting block when you are trying to bring someone into the series. It continues from where it left off in the ""first season part one"" set, and the story gets even more complicated. However, it does have more action, philosophy, and adventure than the first set, showing Ed's pure heart, Al's perhaps too trusting personality, and Winry's sisterly care for them.
I love this set the best out of the first three sets, though it cannot be compared to the last set, which, if you have watched all previous sets, is tear jerking and beautiful. Hiromu Arakawa really thought this series out, as well as the directors, and it shows.
My only complaints are with the packaging and the fact that after episode 28, it strays off from the manga. There are only three disks in this set, as opposed to four the first and third sets. I really enjoy seeing sets with individual DVD cases, but this one folds out like a brochure, and has some DVDs lie halfway on top of each other to save space. A box is home to this ""brochure"", and also contains another box with the guidebooks in it.
I do not like the fact that the episodes after 28 stray off from the manga, but it was inevitable, since the decision to make fma a tv series was made early. The directors came up with a great plot though, going off from volume 6 of the manga, touching on #7 with Greed, and then going off course by episode 40 or so with Dante and Wrath. It has a great ending though, and in some parts, I think they did better than Arakawa actually. It is nice to only follow one plot with characters though.
All in all, you should buy this set, and complete the series by purchasing the other sets. Heartfelt and well thought out, hilarious and outstanding, this is truly a work of art.",1212364800,3,2259,4.380952380952381
2967205,4,B000WE5I1U,"This is the set that I would recommend buying to introduce new viewers to Fullmetal Alchemist.

Throughout the series, there are effective uses of flashbacks. For those unfamiliar with the show, the flashbacks can sometimes be disorienting. I've found that this Part 2 set (while it spoils a couple of ""endings"" from the Part 1 set) controls how much background information is given out much more effectively.

Watch Season 1, Part 2 first...then head back to watch Season 1, Part 1. It'll make more sense (oddly enough) and you'll feel the show's emotional grip much more intensely!",1210032000,,583,5.0

3201685,5,B000WE5I1U,"Well, like with every thing you buy from animation you obviously have to wait until the commercial is over -glares at commercials with loathing- My friend introduced me to Fullmetal Alchemist and I immediately fell in love -watched it first in Japanese though by accident and then English, either way it was great- Vic Mignona does a great job (like always) with Edward Elric's voice. This part continues off with the first season part one, they take Al back to get fixed up, Armstrong (greatest posing comic relief ever with his sparkling personality and muscles XD) enjoying the view and marveling and brotherly bonding. Its a great series and I'm so glad to finally own it, I've become quite the anime/manga addict of late and like always FMA has the deepest of plots compared to a lot of things we see today on t.v. Not dissing on any particular show or movie -cough twi cough light-, but this plot is so awesome, kind of like a mix between the legend of Faust/Frankenstein/Odysseus together. Faust being the alchemy and the deal with the devil going on, basically doing something for his success (Ed's travels gain his success). Frankenstein, obviously Al, he turned his brother into a monster and in that act it was going against nature. Odysseus, they're trying to make it back home through trials that will test their manhood. And through it all even when Ed is tempted to do wrong and break the laws of science for his own benefit he never does because he knows it would mean sacrificing something or someone. -wags brows- Team Edward all the way... Edward Elric that is! XD Hope you enjoy it!",1284422400,,1602,4.704626334519573

Unfortunately the start of each DVD is pretty ad-heavy.  Go grab a soda or something.",1222732800,,300,4.60377358490566
3201696,5,B000WE5I1U,"Every episode in this series is important and interesting to watch, unlike some series that take 10 episodes to resolve a conflict. If you are looking at Season 2, then you most likely already like the series and don't need my help to convince you to get this. Amazon has the best prices I have found, especially if you wait until they become one of your personal daily deals. This is an absolutely awesome series and very worth the price.",1221436800,,439,4.5

3201699,5,B000WE5I1U,I would recommend fullmetal for anyone who is looking for a new anime to watch.  I got interested in it when I saw a preview of the first show.  This is my opinion is one of the best out of the box sets though and the book you get in each box have good draws and artwork.,1219449600,,271,3.736842105263158
3201700,5,B000WE5I1U,"Recieved fast, even with the distance between the shipper and myself, only problem was that I recieved 2 disk 8's and no disk 9, probably a manufacture error.",1217808000,,158,4.678571428571429
3201701,5,B000WE5I1U,"Even though the series has been over for a while now and the movie has come out, I am still a very big FMA fan (as well as a Bleach fan, though it's not as good as fma).
Now, this box set covers episodes 17-28 (3 disks). Ed reunites with the Rockbells (since Scar destroyed his automail), discoveres how the Philosopher's stone is made, battles in Laboratory 5, sees his ""fave teacher"" Izumi, gets shipped off to Yock Island, and discovers a mysterious boy with unhuman powers.
First of all, this set is not a good starting block when you are trying to bring someone into the series. It continues from where it left off in the ""first season part one"" set, and the story gets even more complicated. However, it does have more action, philosophy, and adventure than the first set, showing Ed's pure heart, Al's perhaps too trusting personality, and Winry's sisterly care for them.
I love this set the best out of the first three sets, though it cannot be compared to the last set, which, if you have watched all previous sets, is tear jerking and beautiful. Hiromu Arakawa really thought this series out, as well as the directors, and it shows.
My only complaints are with the packaging and the fact that after episode 28, it strays off from the manga. There are only three disks in this set, as opposed to four the first and third sets. I really enjoy seeing sets with individual DVD cases, but this one folds out like a brochure, and has some DVDs lie halfway on top of each other to save space. A box is home to this ""brochure"", and also contains another box with the guidebooks in it.
I do not like the fact that the episodes after 28 stray off from the manga, but it was inevitable, since the decision to make fma a tv series was made early. The directors came up with a great plot though, going off from volume 6 of the manga, touching on #7 with Greed, and then going off course by episode 40 or so with Dante and Wrath. It has a great ending though, and in some parts, I think they did better than Arakawa actually. It is nice to only follow one plot with characters though.
All in all, you should buy this set, and complete the series by purchasing the other sets. Heartfelt and well thought out, hilarious and outstanding, this is truly a work of art.",1212364800,3,2259,4.380952380952381
3201702,4,B000WE5I1U,"This is the set that I would recommend buying to introduce new viewers to Fullmetal Alchemist.

Throughout the series, there are effective uses of flashbacks. For those unfamiliar with the show, the flashbacks can sometimes be disorienting. I've found that this Part 2 set (while it spoils a couple of ""endings"" from the Part 1 set) controls how much background information is given out much more effectively.

Watch Season 1, Part 2 first...then head back to watch Season 1, Part 1. It'll make more sense (oddly enough) and you'll feel the show's emotional grip much more intensely!",1210032000,,583,5.0
