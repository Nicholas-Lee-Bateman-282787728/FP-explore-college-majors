2043003,5,B0001Y4LZU,"I am stoked for this DVD, not for the selection of matches (which is paltry and can be found on past DVDs), but for the main documentary feature.  It is said to run close to THREE hours and cover just about EVERYTHING that has happened in ECW.  Ever hear about the time Raven crucified Sandman, which was never shown on TV and freaked out an in-attendence Kurt Angle?  Well, it's on here.  So is the stuff involving Jerry Lawler invading ECW, the TNN deal, and a bunch of interviews with former ECW talent.  WWE, for all of it's shortcomings, seems to put out one tremendous DVD after another, and this one looks to be no different.",1099699200,5,632,4.413793103448276
2043004,4,B0001Y4LZU,"Alright it's about time the WWE put out some kind of ECW DVD. I have to say the documentary was very well done. I would have like to see more Shane Douglas stuff but thats cool. It also should not have ended with Tommy Dreamer as the champion.

The extra matches are selected not too badly.

Stevie and Raven vs. The Pitbulls (2/3 Falls Double Dog Coller Match)
****
This match was very very well done. It would get 5 stars if there weren't the two table botches. There were still a lot of table used though. The match features several run ins and just shows how wild ECW could get.

Rey Mysterio Jr. vs. Phicosis (2/3 Falls)
*****
The match is off the charts. Rey Mysterio flies around and makes somebody like Jeff Hardy look like King Kong Bundy. There are two table spots in this one. The leg drop by phicosis gets alot of elevation. Overall, best match on the DVD.

Mikey Whipwreck vs. The Sandman (Ladder Match)
***1/2
This match could have made it up to 5 stars if it had been longer. Very good match with Sandman taking some hard hits to the head with the ladder. Good match, although could have been better if given more time.

Sabu vs. 2 Cold Scorpio
****
Very good fast pace high flying match. Both men take some risks. Great table spot by Sabu.

Raven vs. Tommy Dreamer
***1/2
Good match. It was very hard hitting. Both men bleed a lot. It would have gotten a higher rating if they did better with the tables they used. I mean you thought something big was gunna come, and then they'd do something else and you'd stare at the tv and be like ""o...k"" Theres like close to 10 DDT's in this one. Fun stuff at the end when Jerry Lawler comes in after the match.

Taz vs. Bam Bam Bigelow
**
Not a bad match but not a good selection for a match that was supposed to represent ECW. There are two good spots in this match the rest is well.....meh not bad but nothing too good. Worst match on the DVD.

Jerry Lynn vs. Rob Van Dam
***
Good match with a nice little table spot. Boy do they use the chairs alot in this one. Good match but it got quite slow and boring at some points. It was a slowly paced match.

Overall I give this DVD a 4/5 because of the inclusion and the disclusion of some matches. Get rid of Taz - Bigelow and add in a few more matches.

you want insane?

Sabu vs. Sandman (Stairway To Hell Match) - Houseparty 98

or

Sabu vs Terry Funk (Barbed Wire Rops Match)

at least one Awesome - Tanaka match

Masato Tanaka vs Mike Awesome - Heatwave 98

maybe

Rvd and Sabu vs. Hayabusa and Shinsaki - Heatwave 98

gotta have a Cactus Jack match....and Shane Douglas

Cactus Jack vs. Shane Douglas - ECW TV ( The one with the handcuffs)

No Dudley Boys Match?

Dudley Boys vs. Spike and Balls - ECW TV (Dudley's last ECW Match)

They talk about the technical wrestlers in the documentary so lets throw in

Eddie Guererro vs. Dean Malenko - Hostile City Showdown

Two of the biggest tag teams not in a match okay well....

Gangstas vs. Eliminators (weapons cage match) - ECW TV

finally to show the up and coming of a star in RVD why not...

Sabu vs. RVD (Stretcher Match) - ECW TV

So I say if you even included half of those matches I'vs stated above this DVD would be a 5 star. Include all of em' and this DVD would be the greatest thing out there.",1097452800,,3264,4.204180064308682
2043005,2,B0001Y4LZU,"All of these matches save for 1 or 2 have been released already.

They can be found on the pioneer releases like extreme evolution , path of destruction, etc. They do this with many of their dvds, they just reuse some of the same matches over and over again. For Example; the wwe mick foley release and the pioneer cactus jack dvd. They're almost exactly the same.

 Some matches like the hell in a cell matches(Mankind vs Undertaker and hbk vs undertaker) have also been used in multiple wwe dvds. ECW had so many more unbeleivable and amazing matches during it's short run.  HEY HOW ABOUT SOME MORE TAZ MATCHES AND RVD MATCHES WWE!

Unfortunately, I did not know of the existence of ECW until around 2000, a year before the company folded. As I grew older, I began to learn more about the business and all the exciting organizations/federations that existed in the past.

Key people involved in the growing popularity(and ultimatly,it's demise)of ECW are interviewed about numerous things in ECW.The dvd focuses on when Paul Heyman joins ECW,and ends when Paul Heyman joins WWF/WWE after ECW goes out of buisness in 2001.

2043029,5,B0001Y4LZU,"I bought this back when it first came out. I was excited because I never really new about ECW as a teenager. I read stuff in the magazines but never really saw the product until they invaded WWF/E in 1997. Then I tried to find it everywhere. The main source for me was the PPVs. I loved it, it was different. Now that I'm a little older I do find the old TVs and shows and buy them when I can to fully appreciate this product. And boy this DVD WWE put out was good and told the story through the eyes of the people who had been there prior to their WWE runs and some outside perspectives also from people in the company who weren't there and liked the product. Pair this with the Forever Hardcore production by Shane Douglas and you've got the ultimate ECW story book collection. Get this with the ECW One Night Stands and Hardcore Homecoming tours, you'll have a good current prospective of ECW. You could also get TNA's Hardcore Justice featuring some of the ECW Alumni's who did that PPV, which also was very well done.",1312502400,,1022,4.300518134715026

2043031,5,B0001Y4LZU,"My husband loves wrestling and this was the perfect gift. It had lots of clips and information about the ECW that he found really interesting.
It was also priced great.",1290038400,,168,4.633333333333334
2043032,3,B0001Y4LZU,"I'll be honest, i'm no neutral party reviewing this DVD-i'm a huge fan of the original, only, REAL ECW, the company at one time known as Eastern Championship Wrestling, headed up by Tod Gordon and booked by the great Paul Heyman.
When World Wrestling Entertainment announced plans to release a documentary on the subject, i'm sure i wasn't the only one who broke out into nervous sweats. The WWE purchased the rights and entire catalog of ECW when the struggling company finally went belly up in early 2001. The thought of the ultimate corporate machine in the business, Vince McMahon's WWE, telling the story of the ultimate gangsta independent sounded like just another way for McMahon to dig up his former competitor, bring it temporarily back to life just in order to kick it around some more, attempt to destroy it's reputation to millions of new fans, then bury it again in an obscure grave.
For those of you unaware, Mr McMahon is a very, very successful businessman/wrestling promoter who changed the entire face of the business, beginning back in the early to mid-1980's. Back then, there were numerous ""territories"", each one broadcasting to a certain area of the country. While McMahon's WWF concentrated on New York and the Eastern states, dozens of other individually companies, ranging in size from major league to a mere blip on the radar, divvied up the rest of the country. As hard to believe as such a thing is now, the large majority of these companies helped and supported each other, sometimes trading talent back and forth in order to keep the top of the card programs fresh. Think about that, then imagine McMahon loaning TNA The Undertaker and Rey Mysterio for no financial personal gain. You can't, huh? It's so inconceivable that the only proper visual in the mind's eye is utter blackness.

Instead, Vince McMahon decided to try his own method-by becoming pro wrestling's version of Adolph Hitler-invading these territories and luring all of their most popular and marketable athletes to his own company by offering more money than the smaller companies could afford. Dozens of promoters, some of whom had owned and ran profitable companies for up to 40 years, were suddenly out of business. The modern era of wrestling thus began with a hostile takeover, which was wildly successful for McMahon.

However, while the WWF's leader marketed the product for the first time to kids, a vast majority of older fans were feeling increasingly ignored and bitter. This anger manifested itself in a few renegade promotions-but none of them had the resources to stay viable. Until Eastern Championship Wrestling debuted in 1993.

Despite a shoestring budget, the ECW never waned-instead, it slowly began to pick up steam, as it initially brought in over the hill legends (Jimmy Snuka, Don Muraco, Abdullah the Butcher) to get some name recognition, then phased them out in favor of newer, fresher talent that appealed to this new disgruntled fan base. And what better place to rage against the corporate machine, while inviting those angry fans in, than Philadelphia?

A rundown old Bingo hall was re-christened the ""ECW Arena"", and while it only sat about 1000, it's intimate atmosphere provided wrestling fans with what they had truly missed the most about the old 'territories'-that closeness with the performers, that feeling of truly being 'part of the show'. In contrast, the WWF and it's top competitor, the Ted Turner-owned WCW, were the polar opposite-seemingly forcing the fans farther and farther away from the ring every year, until the audience faded into the background so much that the WWF decided to invent the regrettable use of 'piping in sound'. In other words, since the detatched feel of the current large companies was resulting in quiter and less emotional/vocal crowds, the WWF assumed they had fixed the problem by playing the desired reactions over loudspeakers, in an attempt to fool the fans watching at home into believing they were viewing top notch entertainment: ""You know Dad, at first glance this Papa Shango-Doink the Clown match seems to be dull, lifeless, and endless. But maybe it just doesnt translate to TV, because listen to the audience! They're going wild!"" This would not be the first, or last, example of Vince McMahon's utter disdain for his very own fans; the owner, who grew up very comfortably in a posh Connecticut neighborhood, simply could not identify with the beer drinking, seemingly low class typical ""rasslin fan"" that, despite his efforts to just magically switch audiences from tacky trailer trash to screaming kids and their well dressed, upscale parents, just didn't seem to go away, no matter how juvenile or insulting the gimmick playing out on TV and in the rings was.

All of the above is mentioned in order to set up the still-huge population of ECW fans, who were not at all pleased with the idea of Vince doing a fair piece on their late, great beloved company. Since McMahon years earlier had introduced the tactic of copywriting it's own performers names, and then inventing entirely different backgrounds for even the most well known veterans venturing into WWF waters, it seemed highly likely that, as the saying goes, ""History will be written by the winners""...and although the WWF (now WWE) head had achieved unimagined success, at one point becoming an official billionaire, old habits died hard. Armed with a fleet of lawyers, there wasn't a small business owner, former employee, or toddling lemonade stand proprieter that V-Mac wouldn't gleefully sue into oblivion, loudly gloating to the repulsed media the entire way.
In other words, if the ECW regular performer ""The Sandman"" just happened to tell a story to a small radio station in Des Moines, some 100% accurate recalling of a particularly fascinating program, or angle, that happened in ECW in, say, 1997-the odds were good that Sandy would find himself on the wrong end of a lawsuit the next morning, courtesy of Mr McMahon. Why? For clearly lying and inventing silly nonsense that only happened in Sandman's mind. Sandy could countersue-but where was the proof? Why, locked up in the WWE vault, that's where! And if subpoenaed, well, that was easy to fix=just take the master copy of the original house show the event, that of course WAS completely true, and turn it into an unrecognizable piece of waste...perhaps by cremation, crushing by machine, or setting in Big Daddy V's lunch comissary chair, just before he came around the corner with his trays of piled high food-perhaps the most effective method of all.

So while this remembrance turned out to be not quite as distorted as initially feared, the incredible amount of skipped over events and even top stars from the company's past didn't set well with me. Thus the dilemma-the interviews with some of the great original cult heroes of ECW make for great entertainment, and the collection of matches contain some undeniable classics. But by purchasing this product, and in essence handing your money over to the ""Evil Emperor"" himself, it's hard not to feel a little dirty, as if you yourself sold out everyone that made ECW great, by shelling out cash for a supposed 'documentary' that purposefully omitted huge stars, re-arranged time sequences, and only paid homage to the guys who the WWF/E had seen fit to sign.
That, folks, is the exact opposite of what made the ECW so great-the lack of large conglomerate ""rules"" and undying refusal to cave in the big bad wolves made ECW, in a way, stronger than any of them for a few years. And as Mr McMahon keeps trying to erase that memory from audiences young and old alike, helping to actually fund this atrocity feels dirty and wrong.",1288396800,4,7695,4.956622773044152
2043033,5,B0001Y4LZU,"A great summary of what happened in ECW how it all began and all how it all sadly ended great DVD with great matches with RVD, Raven, Mick Foley, Rey Mysterio, Jerry Lynn, Tommy Dreamer etc.",1287878400,,190,4.305555555555555

I wish people would realized these guys are almsot middle aged now and their continued attemtps to spark ECW actually tarnish its legacy.

2043035,5,B0001Y4LZU,"This may be quite possibly the best DVD that WWE has ever produced. The documentary is nearly 3 hours and is captivating all the way through. I could listen to Paul Heyman talk about ECW any day of the week. The DVD also features interviews from guys like Taz, Little Guido, Mick Foley, Tommy Dreamer, Eric Bischoff, Vince McMahon, the director of ECW Ron Buffone, and others. It gives great insight into the promotion as a whole, chronicling its ups and downs and hardships. Some of the top feuds ECW had are also showcased. Sure, there might not be mention of exactly everything that made ECW so great, but you'll be hard pressed to find a better documentary out there.

The second disc features 3 bonus interviews that seem to have been cut from the actual documentary portion of the set and these 7 matches:

Two out of Three Falls Dog Collar Match- Raven and Stevie Richards vs. The Pitbulls(ECW World Tag Team Championship)= Great, chaotic brawl. The final contested fall was certainly the best and full of great action. You should be watching these matches after you watch the documentary portion however, so you can get a little background on why Tommy Dreamer would run in. If you like a good, bloody brawl, this is right up your alley. 4 out of 5.

Two out of Three Falls- Rey Misterio Jr. vs. Psicosis= Fantastic match. You'll be in heaven with this one if you're a high flying wrestling fan. Non-stop action, the aerial assault never stops. Definitely worth a watch and then some. 5 out of 5.

Ladder Match- The Sandman vs. Mikey Whipwreck(ECW Championship)= Right off the bat, I should let you know that this isn't the typical ladder match you're used to seeing. This match isn't won by climbing the ladder and grabbing the belt, but by pinfall or submission. A pre-Stone Cold Steve Austin makes an appearance before the match, and delivers a great promo. People who never saw him in anything before WWF/E should get a kick out of it. As for the match, one word can describe it: fun. There's not much to it, but it's just a flat out fun and entertaining match to watch. 4 out of 5.

2 Cold Scorpio vs. Sabu(ECW World Television Championship)= A nice, long 30 minute match right here. A strong beginning leads to a middle section of the match that seemed to drag on a bit too much. But they certainly redeemed it with a fantastic final few minutes, definitely give this one a shot. 4 out of 5.

Tommy Dreamer vs. Raven= A historic match in ECW history, simply because of the fantastic feud these two had and the culmination of it was this match right here. An all out brawl if there ever was one, this went all over the arena. Just a true classic from ECW, definitely one to watch...and they even included the crazy post-match WWF ambush led by Jerry Lawler. 5 out of 5.

Taz vs. Bam Bam Bigelow(ECW World Television Championship)= Probably my least favorite match in this collection, but it's certainly a good match and very memorable. The crowd was torn down the middle for this one, not knowing whether to cheer for the hometown boy or the champ and unstoppable Taz. But it isn't too long, has some nice spots and a memorable finish. 3 out of 5.

Rob Van Dam vs. Jerry Lynn(ECW World Television Championship)= It's a Jerry Lynn vs. RVD match...that should tell you enough about its quality. Great match, great spots, great near falls. It does have its minor flaws, and it's not my personal favorite RVD/Lynn match, but still, it's one to definitely watch. 5 out of 5.

I cannot recommend this DVD enough, it's a must have.",1281830400,,3537,4.55748031496063

The matches are okay; my favorites are the Raven & Stevie Richards vs. Pit Bulls, Psicosis vs. Rey Mysterio, Jr. (my father, who is not a huge wrestling fan, enjoyed this match) and Rob Van Dam vs. Jerry Lynn.",1236556800,,513,4.410526315789474

We get all kinds of ecw alumni on this dvd telling the story along with Vince and Eric throwing in their two cents in every once and a while (but what was left in is pretty good things). Many people who don't know that much about ecw will learn and hopefully learn to love what ecw did for the wrestling world. I wish ecw would have had a better turn out as I thought that before but I think it even more now that I have seen this dvd. I think that we are about to have these times again in the wrestling world (the mid to late 90's) as I look at it as WWE is what WWF was, TNA is what WCW was, and ROH is what ECW was just this time I hope we don't get a monopoly out of it this time and that ROH doesn't go under.

We also get 7 matches on this dvd which is just a few but all very enjoyable.

1. Raven and Stevie Richards vs The Pitbulls 2/3 Falls Dog Collar Match World Tag Titles
This is a pretty wild match and pretty good also it is ok at first with crazy table spots during first two falls and then Tommy Dreamer comes out and Dances with Dudley and Dudley Dudley come in and then match just turns to kaos with Bill Alfonso, 911, and Tod Gordan come out also so it is just krazy with it turning out to be a good match in the end 8.5/10

2. Psicosis vs Rey Misterio 2/3 Falls
This match is just amazing it is just great and they do some things that were unheard of for 1995 this is much different then what you would see in wwf and wcw at this time so it would be even better if you were watching it at that time but still great to watch even today 9.5/10

3. The Sandman vs Mikey Whipwreck ladder match World Heavyweight Title
This is a decent match and you don't have to grab the title it's fall only but the match is brutal with them going and doing some pretty crazy things with the ladder but the real story here is steve austin comin out and doing a promo which is just pure gold 6/10 for the match and 8/10 for the promo so this is worth the watch

4. 2 Cold Scorpio vs Sabu TV Title
This is another amazing match these guys go around a half hour of action so this is a good match to watch plus they do some pretty insane moves during this one the match is a good match as Scorpio is underated and Sabu is just plain insane but you get all kinds of great action in this title match 9/10

5. Raven vs Tommy Dreamer
The match kind of impresses me with how brutal these two got and how good of a match they could put on even when they get back to the ring I still find myself really enjoying this one many table spots in this one but Raven does get some nice things from the crowd underscor some we get a Raven chant and a sign that says we'll miss you Raven and one that says this match don't count but also a you sold out chant and get the f**k out chant so I'm not sure they were that happy but good match 9/10

6. Taz vs Bam Bam Bigelow TV Title
I don't like this match as much as some others but I still think that it is better than there rematch that was a ecw death match the match is ok for a while then it gets better and then the finish is just really shocking and looks sooo painful and Taz said it was 7.5/10

7. Rob Van Dam vs Jerry Lynn TV Title
These two always put on great matches now watch for when the get busted open Jerry throws a nasty bow that hit RVD right above the eye and cuts him open and then RVD hits a Van Daminator and knocks Lynn down to the floor and Jerry hits his head gets knocked out and busted open. Now for the match match they do some great wrestling and one really sick table spot and just some insane moves 10/10",1227139200,2,3682,3.874005305039788

2043040,5,B0001Y4LZU,"Where WWF (now WWE) and WCW dared not go, ECW was there.  Disqualification was a thing unheard of in ECW matches, and cheesy fake-punching and fake-kicking (called ""pillowstrikes"" in the wrestling business) are in the sharp minority of wrestling moves, and blood is shed frequently.

I was too young to ever know ECW beyond the mentions of it on the internet and WWF (which I watched a lot back in 2000, 2001, 2002, and now again in 2005, 2006 and beyond), but this DVD does an incredible job of telling the epic story of ECW and its top wrestlers without dragging behind or missing a beat.

It literally chronicles ECW from its rise as Eastern Championship Wrestling as part of the NWA, to the influence of Paul Heyman, who helped cause it to be nicknamed Extreme Championship Wrestling, and eventually broke away and became officially Extreme Championship Wrestling.  They struggled for many years, never having a pay-per-view event until very later on, and having only regional TV access, never syndication until 2000-2001

The story leaves out nothing of importance in telling of the ECW, even dedicating a portion of the documentary to the fans, who were entirely responsible for ECW's mild success, even telling of the loyal fans who went to nearly every show (including one the wrestlers called Hatman because he always wore a straw hat in the front row), bringing their own weapons (from frying pans to boat oars), holding their chairs up for wrestlers to throw other wrestlers onto, and even catching wrestlers that are thrown at them (Spike Dudley for one, being crowd-surfed around the small arena before returned safely to the ring)

The major superstars even have their own segments dedicated to telling their stories in the ring, going from ECW originals like Tommy Dreamer, Raven, Sandman, Tazz, Sabu, Shane Douglas, etc, to people better known for their WWF/WWE exploits, such as Steve Austin (later Stone Cold), Cactus Jack, The Radicalz (Chris Benoit, Dean Malenko, Eddie Guerrero), Rey Mysterio, The Dudley Boys.

The people recounting the stories in the documentary are nearly all the people who were involved with ECW, from the producers, executives and creative assistants, to the wrestlers themselves, Tommy Dreamer, Mick Foley, Chris Benoit, Rob Van Dam, Tazz, Chris Jericho, Eddie Guerrero, even Jerry Lawler (who had a feud with Tommy Dreamer and most all of ECW in 1997), Vince McMahon, Eric Bischoff, and Paul Heyman.

Paul Heyman is without a doubt the most insightful star of these interviews, as he is a great storyteller, with a powerfully emotionally charged voice that grabs your attention and keeps you listening, imitating wrestler's voices (such as Steve Austin and Terry Funk) without a hint of rancor, being as rambunctious and lewd as he can (such as saying in indirect response to Eric Bischoff saying he didn't ""raid"" ECW and steal its superstars, ""Eric Bischoff is full of ****"" or else something to similar effect)

Towards the end, you learn via footage and interviews of what began to bring down ECW.  You hear first-hand from people like Tazz and Spike Dudley and others of the financial troubles with ECW which saw many wrestlers such as Bam Bam Bigelow leave to WCW for better pay, and other stay on by sheer loyalty to Paul, who commanded their loyalty and respect with loyalty and respect of his own to them, and who went without pay for weeks, even months at a time, just so ECW could continue to thrive.  You learn how Paul nearly worked himself to death, working, as one wrestler (I forget who) says Paul worked 20 hours a day for ECW.  It tells of the betrayal of one of ECW's original founders, courting ECW wrestlers to get them sold to WCW and WWF, and Paul forcing him to resign from his post.

At the very end, you see a very gritty piece of footage of Paul Heyman from 2001 on his ECW show, criticizing the network that finally put them on syndicated air (TNN, now Spike TV) claiming very loudly and shockingly, that TNN did not spend a penny in advertising ECW; no commercials, no advertisements, no press releases, absolutely nothing, and they even wrote in their contract that ECW could not seek a different network while they were under contract with TNN, while TNN subtly sought to buy WWF Raw is War from USA Network (which they eventually did in late 2001, and kicked ECW off the air, effectively killing it once and for all).

The documentary is well worth the money in itself, providing well edited clips of fierce matches, going into very dense detail of the history of the business, from its very rise, down to its fall and the migration of many ECW stars to WWF (as WCW had been bought out by WWF in mid 2001), with even a very touching piece of footage taken from the first monday night RAW when Paul becomes commentator with Jim Ross, where J.R. comforts Paul in a very mentorly way, telling him to keep his chin up, he'll be okay, etc.

As an added bonus to the entire thing, we get an extra DVD packed with some memorable ECW matches, chosen apparently for their greatness and impact, rather than their bloodiness.  While there are still bloody and hardcore matches (obviously) some of them are of the more basic, physical kind devoid of blood, such as the ones with Tazz, and the luchadores Psycosis and Rey Mysterio

All in all, it was well worth the money, and works highly effectively in introducing newbies to ECW, or telling the whole story to hardened fans of the franchise.  Most memorable of all in the DVD, which sticks with you long after watching, is the sound coming from nearly every ECW audience in any match---the chants of ""E-C-W! E-C-W! E-C-W! E-C-W!"" every time the match hits a high point.",1167004800,5,5686,4.767039674465921
2043041,5,B0001Y4LZU,"Before the debacle that was the 2006 rebirth of ECW, this 2 disc set started things in motion, as it sold like crazy and convinced Vince McMahon that a WWE produced ECW was a good idea.  This R rated, three hour documentary is full of every twist and turn the original ECW went through, including the Mass Transit incident, the first ECW pay per view, and their struggles on TNN (now Spike TV).

Paul Heyman (of course) gets most of the airtime, but many of the wrestlers (the Dudleys, Tazz, Tommy Dreamer, etc.) offer very candid comments as well.

An extra disc of matches rounds out this fantastic set.  If you weren't a huge ECW fan back in the day, then this won't really tickle your interest.  But to any true pro wrestling fan, it's required viewing.",1166227200,3,757,4.4963503649635035
2043042,5,B0001Y4LZU,"NOTE: I UPDATED THIS REVIEW IN 2013

This was the DVD that started the rebirth of the spirit of Extreme Championship Wrestling back into professional wrestling. Selling out in record numbers and becoming the #2 best selling DVD in WWE (they stopped getting the selling numbers when they were at less than 1,000 sales away from being #1) which lead to the ECW One Night Stand PPV, future WWE releases of ECW, and even the Hardcore Homecoming reunion tour & the Forever Hardcore documentary (which I would recommend right besides this). Here you get a history (not the complete history) of ECW and the influences it's hard on professional wrestling. You only have so much time to condense the history of ECW that they had this DVD cater to those who were under a WWE contract at the time but still, it's a great DVD set.

The documentary stars at how Paul Heyman took over the booking for Eastern Championship Wrestling from Eddie Gilbert and introduced ECW's first home grown act called The Public Enemy. From here, you'll go into ECW first major feud between Tommy Dreamer & Sandman that really ""broke taboo"" in the wrestling business. The importance of the fans (including Hat Guy) & city of Philadelphia are heavily discussed along with the production value, how ECW was really ""reality based"" television, and what made ECW stand out above the WWE & WCW. The influence of pure wrestlers such as Benoit, Malenko, Guerrero along with those such as 2 Cold Scorpio and even Faarooq...oops, I mean Ron Simmons. Extreme lucha libre was discussed as Heyman openly admits that it was Konnan who helped get these guys such as Mysterio, Psichosis, and Juventud into ECW. Also discussed is how ECW was really the beginning for Steve Austin coming into his own as his ""Stone Cold"" character. One of the biggest stories in ECW history was talked about as Stevie Richards & Kurt Angle himself give their accounts to the crucifixion of the Sandman including never before seen footage of the whole incident & Raven breaking character to apologize. The business relationship between WWE & ECW is also talked about including how the whole thing started with ""King Mabel"" which led to cross promotion on RAW, the Mind Games PPV, and eventually later Jerry Lawler himself invading ECW. The whole emotional story being ECW gaining...then losing...then gaining their Barely Legal PPV is touched apon along with the stories behind of the main events. Also you hear the behind the scenes stories of wrestlers taking jobs inside the company to help itself out. From here the downfall starts as you hear about financial problems and top wrestlers leaving the company, the entire TNN and how it didn't turn out to be as good as expected along with why Taz (World Champion) and Dudley Boyz (Tag Team Champions) left ECW after being on TNN for one week. The whole Mike Awesome/WCW story including the footage of Taz winning the title...only to be beaten by WWE Champion Triple H on SmackDown before losing the belt to Dreamer, everyone's thought on what ended ECW, and Paul Heyman's thoughts on debuting on RAW in February close the documentary out.

Throughout the documentary you get profiles & a little history on such ECW stars like Paul Heyman & Tommy Dreamer themselves, Public Enemy, Taz, Sabu, Terry Funk, The Sandman, Mickey Whipwreck, Cactus Jack, Raven, ""Extreme Superstar"" Steve Austin, the bWo, the Dudleys, and Rob Van Dam. You also hear stories from these wrestlers (again, under contract to WWE) regarding personal stories from ECW such as Taz breaking his neck, Sabu getting fired, and his reign as the FTW Champion. Tommy Dreamer's account of the feud between him & Raven including the controversial lesbian storyline, RVD's feelings about his involvement at the Barely Legal PPV, Stevie Richards story behind the Blue World Order, Al Snow story of how ""Head"" restarted his whole career, D-Von's take on the whole Mass Transit Incident along with the Dudley's account of being the most hated tag team on the planet. Also throughout this documentary, you'll hear comments from what many called ""The Anti-Christ Of ECW"" Eric Bischoff in regards to various subjects regarding ECW such as him ""raiding"" talent like Benoit, Guerrero, Malenko, and Jericho along with Rey Mysterio Jr. & the rest of the luchadors. You will also hear how Bischoff felt about ECW during the Monday Night Wars & how he felt they were never a threat and why they went out of business. You will also hear from Vince McMahon himself regarding why he would help ECW, their working relationship, and if he thinks WWE's ""Attitude"" came from ECW's ""Revolution"".

Matches Include:
2 Out Of 3 Falls/Dog Collar Match: Tag Team Champions Raven & Stevie Richards vs. Pitbulls - The stipulation here was that The Pitbulls must win the tag team titles or split up as Raven came out alone causing Pitbull #1 to drag Stevie from the back busted open while Pitbull #2 & Raven went at it working each other over with a hangman's choke over the top rope & piledriver through a table which busted Pitbull #2 open before the Pitbull's retailiated with Stevie Richards getting superbombed through another table.  Both teams brawled on the outside with weapons from a frying pan to a chair being used along with allies of both teams getting involved leading to such results as multiple superbombs from both teams including one with Raven's head bouncing off the side of the table, members of both teams going through tables in & outside of the ring, Beulah getting into a catfight with someone who had unfinished business with her, and Bill Alfonzo once again getting into it with Tod Gordon that caused him to make a decision that he ended up paying for.  This was your typical ECW hardcore match as you saw a bunch tables destroyed, weapons involved, high impact moves, and plenty of unexpected suprises.
Gangsta's Paradise '95
[ECW: Hardcore History]

2 Out Of 3 Falls: Rey Misterio Jr. vs. Psicosis - Both men started this match off with a very fast paced style with Rey getting the first big move in with a crossbody off the apron that took both men over the guardrail followed by an over the top rope dive onto Psicosis in the front row capitalised on by a series of head scissor takeovers including one from the apron to the floor but Psicosis started coming back focusing on Rey's back with a spear to the back & powerbomb while also stretching it with a sharpshooter.  Both men started to take things to more of an extreme such as a powerbomb on a table, another top rope dive into the front row, Psicosis running so hard into the corner that he flipped over the turnbuckle into the post falling over the top to the floor, chairs being launched causing the other to be wearing it like a turtleneck, top rope legdrop though an outside table, and a senton moonsault with a chair.  This was a lucha libre contest in the opening falls with both men really turning it up & getting extreme in that final fall.
""Hardcore TV"" Oct. '95

Ladder Match: ECW Champion Sandman vs. Mikey Whipwreck - This was a regular match that you win by pinfall or submission except a ladder was not only legal to use but encouraged as Steve Austin appeared before the match to not only have words with both men but also take care of Woman.  Mikey started out hitting Sandman in the face with the ladder only for Sandman to go on the offensive using the ladder for a somersault splash & just throwing it at Mikey on the outside however Mikey came back with multiple chairshots & even delievering a frankensteiner off the ladder to the floor before both men continued to brawl in the crowd with both men taking hits from the ladder right in the face including one that caused bleeding.  The match itself wasn't much past a brawl with the ladder being used as a weapon which it was designed to be in this case but was more about the emotional win afterwords & the appearence of Steve Austin before.
""Hardcore TV"" Oct. '95

Television Champion 2 Cold Scorpio vs. Sabu - They started out feeling each other out with Sabu being the first man to gain an advantage with his trademark offense such as the spinning kick, double jump leg lariat in the corner & another one over the top rope into the front row, and slingshot kneedrop while Scorpio was able to regain the momentum with a powerbomb & top rope legdrop while also implimenting a chair into the match sending Sabu into it face first only for Sabu to counter another attempt sending Scorpio into the chair & a clothesline that took both men out of the ring.  Both men went through a series of reversals & counters with Sabu focused on submissions like a the camel clutch while Scorpio resorted to dirty tactics like a low blow & using a weapon as both men traded momentum back & forth with such offense as going aerial with somersaults & moonsaults, suicide dives to the outside, and top rope moves like the legdrop & 450 splash.  This was a very athletic contest where both men left stronger than they went into the match as they really push themselves to limits that not many people pushed them to before this.
CyberSlam '96
[Wrestling's Highest Flyers]

Tommy Dreamer vs. Raven - Tommy Dreamer had never scored an official victory over Raven throughout their entire feud in ECW & this was his final opportunity to do so as it was no secret (based off the ""YOU SOLD OUT!"" chants) that Raven was leaving to go to WCW.  The fight got taken to the outside of the building back in within the opening minutes as the brawled through the crowd with Dreamer thrown off the bleachers through the merchandise table, both men thrown into guardrails, Raven hit with a legdrop takedown, and both men bleeding.  They made their way back to the ring after a few minutes where the fight continued with both men trading low blows & the females at ringside going at it along weapons coming into play like a drop toe hold onto a chair & later one man launched off the tope rope onto the open chair & a road sign taking out more than one person followed by a piledriver on it.  While this could be debated if this was their best match from an in-ring standpoint, no denying this was the most emotional encounter they ever against each other heavily playing into the factor that it was Dreamer's last chance but stay tuned afterwords as one feud ended & another one began right away with an invasion lead by one person nobody ever expected to see in the ECW arena.
Alternative Commentary with Tommy Dreamer & Johnathan Coachman included Dreamer's thoughts on the feud & it's impact to the point that people still didn't know who would win despite Raven leaving the company, Paul Heyman, and comments in regards to Beulah which you'll get a chuckle out of if you know about the real life relationship between Tommy & Beulah.
WrestlePalooza '97
[Top 25 Rivalries]

Television Champion Taz vs. Bam Bam Bigelow - Bam Bam Bigelow was in his hometown of Asbury Park as this match started off hot with Taz kept taking down Bigelow with an armbar & hip lock before taking him over the top with a clothesline but Bigelow regained control catching Taz on the outside followed by a powerbomb in the ring before the match got taken back to the outside with Taz delievering a suplex off the ramp into the crowd with him hitting his own head on the guardrail coming down.  Both men delievered some impactful moves to each other like Bigelow's twisting top rope moonsault, Taz deadlifting Bigelow throught a table, one man punching through a piece of table to hit the other guy, and resorting to low blows before something happened that resulted in one of the most infamous moments in ECW history to the point where it was still replayed in the opening credits of the show after both men had left the company.  This was definately an physical match as both men went stiff against each other at times & the finish was definately described by the fans in attendance, ""Holy S....!""
Alternative Commentary with Tazz & Michael Cole talked included Tazz's throughts on the ECW wrestling style, the fans, and Bigelow himself.
Living Dangerously '98
[ECW: Deep Impact]

Television Champion Rob Van Dam vs. Jerry Lynn - Due to the controversal ending to their Living Dangerously match, this match now has the stipulation of No Time Limit as both men started off with series of reversals & counters that kept ending in stalemates early with RVD coming out of it with a cut over his eye with Lynn gaining the advantage knocking RVD off the apron followed by a series of top rope moves such as a dive to the outside, legdrop with RVD between the ropes, and bulldog but Bill Alfonzo made his presence known leaving an opening for RVD to use his educated feet for various side kicks including one driving a chair into Lynn's face while he was crotched on the top rope & another one that sent Lynn called the ""concrete facial"" that knocked him out followed by a running dive onto Lynn in the front row.  Both men traded momentum with hard hitting moves like an Alabama Slam, top rope sunset flip powerbomb out of the corner & later another one off the apron through a ringside table, a backdrop off the top rope onto the floor, and the chair used multiple times with Alfonzo getting one launched at him.  This has gone down as one of the greatest matches in ECW history as it was a very physical athletic contest that saw both men once again push each other to another level that nobody else was able to do.
Alternative Commentary with Rob Van Dam & Michael Cole talks about Lynn earning the nickname of ""The New F'n Show"", the ECW fans & environment, comparing each other's styles, Bill Alfonzo, how he changed his styles coming into WWE, and how this match was on the very first episode of ""ECW On TNN.""
Hardcore Heaven '99
[ECW: Extreme Revolution]

The biggest criticism I have (despite the fact that non-WWE wrestlers weren't interviews or heavily discussed) with this is that some of the facts are incorrect. Despite how WWE made it look, Anarchy Rulz wasn't Taz's last match in ECW when he ended up wrestling there for the rest of the year including a PPV match against RVD. The Tod Gordon mole story which Tod explained better on the Forever Hardcore DVD which revealed it was a work but yet WWE make it look like this was something that was really happening. And how it was made to look like Dreamer was the last ECW Champion when he was only ECW Champion for around 20 mins. But overall, a great DVD documentary.",1152489600,3,14446,4.659733124018838

This is a no holds barred look at the wrestling company that changed the landscape of wrestling for good. In a near 3 Hours Documentary (Yes 3 Full Hours) Paul Heyman, Tommy Dreamer, Nunzio, Rhino, Vince Mcmahon, Mick Foley and Others talk about the 8 years Paul E run the company and push the envlope so far - Feauting the High points like Barley Legal the company first PPV, creating The BWO, making people like Raven, Tommy Dreamer, RVD, Sabu, Al Snow, Public Enemy, Micky Whipwreck and others and the fan suppor and loyalty to the ECW brand. It also talks about Low Points the death of an underage kid - 17 he was - (Which cost them the Barely Legal PPV for a while.) , The crucifixion which angered guest Kurt Angle. Going national on tv and losing Taz and the Dudleys to the WWE, and it slow painful death with fans who still care for the company. Your Laugh, Cry, wonder how the WCW Eric Bischoff got on this DVD - (I wish Bischoff would say he did nick alot of ECW stuff.) Your see the most personal shoot promo ever and Paul Heyman debut on WWE Raw. But that only half of this 2Disc set covered.

2043046,5,B0001Y4LZU,"Well, I finally got The Rise and Fall of ECW and watched it today. It seemed like the best day to watch it, considering that the second ECW Pay-Per-View in two years will be airing tomorrow night, courtesy of the WWE.

I was an ECW fan back in the day, but not as hardcore as most of the other ECW fans out there. I was a fan of all three brands, WWF/E, WCW, and ECW. As I watched this DVD, it made me wish I had been on the ECW bandwagon from the beginning. Watching the rise of a small company to what nearly made them the number two organization in professional wrestling was very entertaining. Aside from the seven matches, which in my opinion were not some of the best matches but they were decent nonetheless, is three hours filled with great interviews with the people who made Extreme Championship Wrestling.

Tommy Dreamer, Mick Foley, Rob Van Dam, Buh Buh Ray Dudley, D'Von Dudley, and Al Snow are just a few of the former stars who give great insight in their comments about the dealings of the promotion. Paul Heyman, the mastermind behind ECW, also gives alot of great details in talking about the dealings made in getting ECW to its peak. Some other very interesting comments come from Eric Bischoff and Jerry Lawler, who make some honest comments regarding their opinion of ECW. These you do not want to miss. And you don't want to miss Paul Heyman's comments in reaction to some of these comments.

There is no doubt that fans of professional wrestling will find this 2 disc set to be a great addition to their collection. Even if you did not follow ECW back in the day, there is enough information to make you feel knowledgable about the ECW product and make you appreciate all the work Heyman and his crew put into the company. The first disc contains the The Rise and Fall of ECW, which lasts about three hours long. And there isn't a dull moment in those three hours. The second disc contains the seven matches.

All in all, for any ECW fan, this is a must buy. And for any wrestling fan, it's about as close to a must buy as you can get. It's like a classic story of the underdog rising to the top.",1149897600,,2119,4.356962025316456

2043048,5,B0001Y4LZU,this movie is one of the best hardcore action i had seen.,1143590400,,57,3.8333333333333335
2043049,3,B0001Y4LZU,"E C dub!! The famous chant of the diehard fans packed into a bingo hall somewhere in Philly. For those you don't know or don't care, ECW was a wrestling company run on a shoe string budget and hardcore rules. It was famous for being the 3rd major wrestling company during the pro wrestling explosion of the late 90's. Because of WWF and ""dubya C dubya's"" deep check book, the company was always on the verge of collapsing. It is also remember as the breeding ground of great talent like Steve Austin, Mick Foley, Eddie Guerrero, Chris Jericho, 3D, and RVD and many more.

Being interested in both business and hardcore  pro wrestling this documentary is a good peak at what was happening back stage during these times. But I found the DVD itself to be a bit lacking.

The first disk (the actual documentary) is pretty entertaining. Like most WWE products you get the ""Don't try this at home"" PA announcement in the beginning. It runs much like any other doc that WWE does. With interviews from the talent and brief shots of what is being discussed. The problem with this is that we don't know see all the talent. WHAT ABOUT RAVEN!!! what about the Sandman or Sabu. Do we ever hear from them? Can we hear the reasons why Sabu decided not to show up for a PPV?? No!! We never do. Because Vince McMahon in all his greedy mind decided that he wasn't going to interview anybody that wasn't currently on the WWE roster. Vinny Mac split in the face of ECW by reassuring all of us that its really about the MONEY not the product. Vinny isn't going to make any money off of Raven or Sabu (not even Mikey Whipwreak gets an interview) so why interview them!

Also I was kind of disappointed with the matches themselves. There is only 8 matches...that's it. The first one, Pit Bulls vs Raven and Steve Richards is probably the most entertaining. At one point Raven's head bounces off a table without breaking it..OUCH. The match gets more intense at the end as Tommy Dreamer, 911, and the Dudleys (not the ones we know today) make run ins. Sandman vs Whipwreak is ok, in which Steve Austin with a Hulk Hogan like look makes a cameo. Sandman does some sick moves with the ladder as well. The Taz match and the match with Rey Mysterio are ok, but the luchodor match is really kind of like any other cruiser weight match you see. Except for a chair shot every now and then..it's not all that great. By far though the worst match was RVD vs Lynn. Oh my God was this boring. It's a 20 minute match with just RVD and Lynn going back and forth at each other. To make matters even worst RVD's manager is blowing his whistle like ADD child on crack. It is so annoying that you may find yourself looking for the mute button on your remote. 2 cold Scorpio vs Sabu is also a long winded match. But its more entertaining then the RVD match. Finally we come to the final match between Dreamer and Raven...when Raven was about to fly to ""dubya C dubya"" where his fat paycheck awaited him. Dreamer and Raven go all through the arena with this match. Dreamer pretty much owns throughout the match but Raven gets in a good couple of hits every now and then.

Decent DVD. You will probably be better off renting it cause it is a short DVD. They could of giving us a little bit more of ECW. Of course the reason they didn't give us more matches is cause Vinny Mac is trying to get every drop out of the ECW franchise. Why spoil it all on just one DVD? Hopefully this DVD is just a teaser for things to come",1136073600,,3474,4.33026113671275
2043050,4,B0001Y4LZU,"This Wwe-Produced documentary follows the history of what was Ecw. I was a fan of Ecw long before this dvd came out, But being that i couldn't really find no Ecw dvds in my area, I picked this dvd up last year when i was in New Jersey for christmas. And despite the fact that the Wwe left out some information about some key Ecw wrestlers and Despite the fact that the documentary doesn't even bother to go into detail about the last 9 months of Ecw's existence, I still found myself wanting to watch this documentary again. I had the fortune of living in the northeast where Ecw was on tv. So that means i saw Ecw when they existed. And i know all of what Ecw was about. It was a hardcore anything goes company. It was nothing like the Wwe or Wcw. It was an in-your-face, Violent, Action-packed company that many independent companies try to unsuccessfully copy nowadays. I seriously doubt there could've been an Ecw without Paul Heyman as it's owner. This documentary does do a great job of explaining what Ecw was and this documentary is the right thing to be looked at by a wrestling fan who never did see Ecw when it was in business. But, For long-time Ecw fans like myself, This documentary is a bit of a letdown in some ways. Due to the fact that many of Ecw's key wrestlers weren't under contract with the Wwe when this dvd was being made, A lot of essential Ecw wrestlers don't get the type of coverage they deserve on this dvd. Guys like Shane Douglas [A man Vince Mcmahon beefs with to this day, If you don't know about it], Bam Bam Bigelow, Tajiri [He's with the Wwe and they don't even talk about him on this dvd!], The elminators, Rhyno [He was with the Wwe and he didn't get no coverage as far the documentary was concerned, but at least he was allowed to talk], Steve Corino, Justin Credible, Lance Storm [He's with the Wwe and even though he was allowed to talk, The only stuff on this documentary that actually mentioned his name Was 1 match at barely legal against Rvd], Jerry Lynn, Mike Awesome [A man the Wwe really misused], Danny Doring & Roadkill [They deserve coverage on this dvd, After all, They were the final Ecw world tag team champions!], and others. But with all that said, My biggest problem with the documentary is that it ends with Tommy Dreamer winning the title and they don't even acknowledge the fact that Justin Credible won the belt from him that very same night! But anyway, Despite its major flaws, I deeply enjoyed this documentary and i'm glad i own a copy of this. Now, Onto my opinions about the matches on disc 2:

1. 2 out of 3 falls dog collar match for the Ecw tag team titles
Champions Raven & Stevie Richards Vs. The pit bulls
This match was too long, The wrestling was too stiff, And there was far too much interference toward the end of the match. This is a bad match and trust me when i say this, This is a poor example of what Ecw was like. Ecw had far better matches than this. There were a few good spots in this match, But other than that, This match definitely shouldn't be considered one of Ecw's best matches. The pit bulls won the titles in this match.
*1/2

2. 2 out of 3 falls match
Rey Mysterio, Jr. Vs. Psychosis
Now, This match wasn't that bad. This match happened many times in Wcw, So i already knew what to expect. These are 2 of my favorite luchadores, So i guess i'd be able to say that i enjoyed enough of this match to be able to say it was ok. There is some great high-flying action in this match and at least it ain't too long. ***

3. Ladder match for the Ecw heavyweight title
Champion The sandman Vs. Mikey Whipwreck
This match was simply boring. The only good thing about it was the fact that Steve Austin appeared and said a few funny things. Other than that, This is another boring match that didn't deserve to be shown on this dvd. *1/2

4. For the Ecw Television title
Champion 2 cold scorpio Vs. Sabu
This match would've been a sure classic if it just wasn't so long! There was a 30 minute time limit, And unfortuantely, They went the whole time limit without a fall! The match had some pretty impressive aerial moves from both of these guys, But, The fact that the match just dragged through some of its time limit made the match seem like it went on forever. Being a fan of Ecw, I'm a big fan of both of these guys. 2 Cold Scorpio is one of my all-time favorites as well as Sabu. If it was just trimmed by about 15 minutes, This match would've been excellent. The both of these guys wrestle to a 30-minute time limit draw, so Scorpio retains the title in this match. **1/2

5. Tommy Dreamer Vs. Raven
This is one of the better matches on the 2nd disc. These 2 guys had a nice feud heading into this match and this match actually wasn't that bad. These 2 guys were able to keep my attention during this match. And while it wasn't a great match by any means, It was decent and watchable. Also, Keep in mind, Raven was about to depart from Ecw to Wcw right after this match was over so needless to say, Tommy Dreamer won this match. The Wwe's Jerry Lawler even showed up at the end of this match, Being that he seeked revenge for Ecw invading several episodes of Raw. ***

6. For the Ecw Television title
Champion Tazz Vs. Bam Bam Bigelow
This was an overrated match. This match really isn't as good as people say it was and the only reason this match was even memorable is because of the now-famous moment when Bam Bam and Tazz collided through the ring. This match was boring and it definitely doesn't deserve to be shown in its entirety on this dvd. Needless to say, Bam Bam took home the Ecw tv title that night. The match wasn't totally bad, Give it credit on that. But it wasn't good, Neither. I like both of these guys a lot, But this match just didn't appeal to me. Their heatwave '98 match was a little better, But still wasn't that good. **

7. For the Ecw World Television title
Champion Rob Van Dam Vs. Jerry Lynn
This was the only match i truly enjoyed that they put on the 2nd disc of this dvd. This match was good and this match features excellent wrestling from both of these guys. This match is a true example of how good Ecw really was. This is the only bonus match on disc 2 that i actually liked. This is a true Ecw classic. Rvd retained his tv title and he would reign as the tv champion for just about 2 years. *****

If you just want a reminder of how good Ecw was, Go buy this dvd. Even though the documentary has its flaws, It's probably the best thing the Wwe has ever put together. With that said, It's no wonder this dvd is the highest-selling Wwe dvd of all time. It may have its problems, But for People who got to see Ecw when it was in business and for people who didn't get to see Ecw when it was in business, This dvd is a blessing. Because of the overwhelming success of this dvd, The Wwe even went as far as to have an Ecw reunion pay-per-view this year called one night stand, Which can also be found on dvd. I highly reccomend this dvd to wrestling fans.",1131580800,2,6978,4.249246987951807
2043051,5,B0001Y4LZU,"Why should I buy this DVD, do I hear that!!? Forget the matches, to me that was added bonus, what made me order the DVD is the plain fact that it has a 3 hour documentary on the history of the most revolutionary wrestling company ever! You would be taken behind the scenes by the man himself-Paul Heyamn, along with some of the icons of ECW RVD, Tommy Dreamer, Dudley Boys, Tazz etc.",1128556800,,383,4.260273972602739
2043052,5,B0001Y4LZU,"Admittedly, I didn't really start following ECW until I saw ECW Heatwave '98 (its best overall PPV in my opinion) so this documentary helped me to catch up on the history of this gone but not forgotten underground federation.

I loved how they highlighted some of the main people that helped make ECW what it became. From Todd Gordon to the late Eddie Gilbert to Paul Heyman to Shane Douglas to TAZ to Sabu to Terry Funk to Tommy Dreamer to The Sandman to RVD to The Dudleys and many more!

One of the few weakness in this is that we didn't hear comments from ECW stars that weren't under contract with WWE. I realize the legal ramblings and all but it would've been nice to hear from James Fullington (The Sandman) or Raven or Shane Douglas on this piece. Still, you do get your money's worth as this documentary is around 3 hours long. Very little history gets omitted here.

I will also say that while the problems between Paul Heyman and Eric Bischoff are just as much a part of ECW lore as anything else, I take exception to comments made by both parties such as when Eric said he didn't ""steal"" any guys from ECW. Let's face it, those ECW stars that DID go to WCW may have called them but Bischoff still had to give the green light to bring them in. But I do agree with Bischoff that Heyman's unwillingness to tone down the product may have been ECW's downfall as well. Still, I find it ironic how he talks about ECW's failings when at the same time it fell in January of 2001, WCW was also falling too! It fell in March of 2001 I should note.

Anyway, back to the DVD set, I think you'll find this piece enlightening, especially to those that insist that ECW was about nothing but violence for the sake of violence. Correct me if I am wrong but professional wrestling/sports entertainment in of itself is violent in nature, ECW just took it to a more basic, barbaric level. BUT, lost in all that, they also had great wrestlers like Eddie Gurrerro, Dean Malenko, Chris Benoit, Rob Van Damn, TAZ, Lance Storm, the late Chris Candido, Shane Douglas and others.

The bonus matches may not have been the greatest in ECW history BUT I was happy to get a hold of any ECW history! Here they are:

The Pit Bulls Vs. Raven & Stevie Richards (2 out of 3 fall Dog Collar Match/ECW World Tag Team Championship) - Wasn't a tag team classic but it had some very brutal spots with tables. The Pit Bulls weren't exactly the second coming of The Road Warriors BUT they were powerful to say the least. We also see an appearance of The Dudley Boyz but not the ones we know now. These two were different Dudleys. Buh-Buh Ray and D-Von came along later as well as Spike.

Rey Mysterio Vs. Psicosis (2 out of 3 fall match) - This is what I wish their reunion match at ECW One Night Stand would've been like! Awesome spots! Its amazing both men walked out that night!

Mikey Whipwreck Vs. The Sandman (Ladder Match for the ECW Title) - We get an apperance from the legendary valet known as Woman (who is now the real life wife of WWE star Chris Benoit) as well as from ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin (who was called ""Superstar"" Steve Austin at the time). Not a great match but Mikey DOES hit The Sandman with a ladder shot that almost instantly breaks him open!

2 Cold Scorpio Vs. Sabu (ECW World TV Title Match) - Great technical and arieal display though a little more dirty wrestling than I expected from Scorpio (trust me,  you'll know it when you see it)! Doesn't take away from the bout though.

Tommy Dreamer Vs. Raven - These two had several wars over the ECW years and this one took place right before Raven's departure to WCW. I should also note that ECW commentator Joey Styles is joined by the late ""Ravishing"" Rick Rude for commentary. The end also sees a guest appearance of Jerry ""The King"" Lawler as he along with Sabu and RVD beat up nearly every ECW star in the building! This is also where Lawler made his famous sh*t comment!

Rob Van Damn Vs. Jerry Lynn (ECW World TV Title Match) - This was one of several good bouts they had in 1998! While this one was good, I think the one they had earlier that year at ECW Living Dangerously '98 was better than this one. Still, can't sleep on this version of their matchup!

Overall, this two disc DVD is a great buy! Enjoy!",1128124800,,4263,4.347169811320755
2043053,4,B0001Y4LZU,"WWE is the beneficiary of the demise of ECW and is the one telling the story of a conquered competitor.  It is quite remarkable that this is such a complimentary view of ECW and that a 3 hour documentary focus would be given to it.

Let's face it.  I highly doubt WWE is going to produce a product on the grand history of WCW and certainly not with the level of treatment given on this DVD.

And for good reason.  WCW was basically the same product as WWE however inferior and not as successful.  On the other hand, ECW was revolutionizing the industry focusing mainly on blood and violence.  Perhaps, they weren't the first, especially if you consider Japan and other countries.  But ECW did pioneer the popularization of it in the U.S.

My speculation is that the huge WWE wrestling boom and expansion during this time can be credited more to ECW than to WWE itself.  I think it can be reasonably speculated that WWE was watching a hugely successful competitor take off quickly and adopted ECW influence into ""Raw"" and ""Attitude"" and gave up a lot of the ""wrestling is real"" charade that insulted the audience.  I think these changes in the WWE wrestling product have most of the responsibility for the growth in popularity during the time and that ECW's influence could possibly be the reason.

WWE mainstreamed the style, rejected the more extreme aspects and violence.  But they also allowed ""inside"" terminology to be known by fans and let wrestlers write books that did not hold the ""wrestling is real"" illusion.

This DVD shows that ECW has earned a huge amount of respect and presents a far more complimentary view than expected by a former competitor, however, this is not to say the DVD still doesn't paint a picture extremely spun to WWE's interests.

This DVD presents WCW as villians who Paul Heyman and ECW really hated and fought to win competition against.  WWE is presented as naively helping ECW to its own detriment by helping a competitor it respected.  That's really pushing it.

I believe it is probably true that Heyman primarily hated WCW due to conflicts when he was there.  This DVD also shows Eric Bischoff took a much more clashing approach competing with ECW. WWE was much more diplomatic (and more sinister).  For example, in acquiring ECW talent, this DVD presents that Bischoff would throw it into Heyman's face whereas McMahon would reimburse Heyman financially and also promotionally through co-promoting.  These things I do believe.

However, what I don't buy is that this dvd presents McMahon as naively helping a competitor.  One interview has McMahon questioning himself why he would do such a stupid thing.  Give me a break.

McMahon is a much smarter business man than Bischoff.  It was wise reimbursing Heyman financially for stolen talent.  He was raping ECW by taking their top financial revenue generating wrestlers yet was buying a positive relationship with his victim with one-time payments.

Whereas WCW was angering ECW by raping them and throwing it in their face, WWE was not only raping ECW more extremely but kept a good relationship to do even worse to ECW, the copromotion.  This is where Vince stopped raping ECW and killed ECW instead.

WWE was effectively causing ECW to popularized through WWE causing its public association through WWE and lessening ECW's impact as being associated as an anti-WWE product (which it certainly was an anti-WWE product).  WWE also gained much more venue to further rob ECW talent.

Paul Heyman was a great wrestling promotor but not a good business man as he was swallowing McMahon's hook, line and sinker while actually believing ECW was pulling one up on WWE by using them to promote ECW.  Whereas the truth is WWE was setting up taking over ECW while playing ignorant.

This DVD follows as Heyman takes over the struggling Eastern Championship Wrestling promotion and popularizes it by focusing in an entirely new direction.

This documentary shows the backgrounds of a lot of ECW's popular wrestlers and their controversial storylines.  Most of which were all homegrown at ECW.  We see their many contributions and how they affected ECW's growth.

We also see their closeness and loyalty as Heyman inspired ECW to be personal to their wrestlers.  There was great loyalty and sense of ownership with most of ECW's talent.  They also had all kinds of jobs in ECW besides wrestling such as shipping merchandise and voicing the order line.

This dvd shows their struggles for their first Pay-Per-View which was a huge success.

It shows their growth and how it required constantly growing airtime and exposure to pay the corresponding growing salaries and expenses.

It shows that the demise was caused by being forced contractually to stay on a network that put no promotion into them while negotiating with WWE to replace them.  ECW was contractually obligated not to look for venues to carry its content although the network was working against ECW obligations.

ECW was bouncing checks during this time. (I'm not sure if this started before or during this situation) and it was a fatal situation to a extremely successfully growing company.  ECW was actually selling out events when they ended.

The 2nd disk of matches really isn't anything special.  I didn't find them to be very entertaining and I am aware that they had a lot of good content in their history.

Overall, its a pretty good documentary on ECW history, though somewhat spun in WWE's interests, though WWE does allow a lot of anti-WWE sentiments displayed.",1127347200,,5518,4.888051668460711
2043054,5,B0001Y4LZU,"Best documentary WWE has ever done. This DVD shows you the whole history of ECW from beginning to end and shows the real ups and downs of ECW. I became a wrestling fan around 2000 and caught the end of ECW when the company was going down so i never really got to see the best of the company. If you are like me get this DVD this shows you the real ECW and what ECW was at its best.

The DVD has interviews with former ECW stars Tommy Dreamer, Tazz, Y2J, Mick Foley etc the owner Paul Heyman and others in the business like Vince (made out to be the savouir of ECW) and Eric Bischoff (the evil WCW guy), its a shame they couldn't get guys like Raven, Sandman and Sabu but i suppose if you aren't under a WWE contract you weren't involved.

The DVD is a real history of ECW and worth buying for any wrestling fan as ECW changed wrestling history and changed wrestlings style forever.

The Rise and Fall also contains 7 bonus matches (wish there were more) in their entirety these are:

ECW Tag team Titles - 2 Out Of 3 Falls

Raven and Stevie Richards (c) w/ Buelah vs. The Pitbulls - Great tag team match with lots of brawling and some quick falls. Stevie and Raven take some good table spots (Raven smacking his head against a table OUCH!) This match is a brilliant 2 out of 3 falls match and is a proper ECW style match. 9/10

2 Out Of 3 Falls

Rey Mysterio Jr vs. Psicosis - WOW hardcore luca libre my second favourite match on the DVD. Lots of high flying from both guys and some quick falls with weapons involved brilliant!!! 10/10

ECW Title - Ladder Match

Th Sandman (c) w/ Women vs. Mikey Whipwreck - Only really on DVD because Steve Austins promo at the beginning but still a good ladder match. Sandman takes a nasty ladder shot and is busted wide open, this match is pretty short but is good to see Mikey the underdog winning the title. 8/10

ECW TV Title

2 Cold Scorpio (c) vs. Sabu - A great technical match from Sabu and Scorpio with both giving some great action. Watch Sabus bump from ring onto table outside AMAZING. 9/10

Tommy Dreamer vs. Raven - This is their last battle before Raven left for WCW and what a battle it is. This brawl goes all over the arena and throughout the crowd and there are weapons everywhere. After this match you also get the bonus of the invasion of Jerry Lawler in the ECW arena! 9/10

ECW TV Title

Tazz (c) vs. Bam Bam Bigelow - These two have a great match in Bams home town which features the infamous move where they both goe through the ring, also watch out for Tazz smashing his head against the guardrail after doing a suplex on Bam from the walkway. 9/10

ECW TV Title

RVD (c) vs. Jerry Lynn - Best match on DVD showing RVD and Lynn putting everything into this awesome match and how RVD should wrestle in the WWE today. Some great moves and Jerry carries on after being knocked out on the floor both give it their all. 10/10

If you are a fan of the ECW days or just want to see part of wrestling history buy this DVD. You get so much a 2 hour plus documentary and 7 bonus matches (could have been more).You get the feeling that you know more about ECW and is worth its money as one of the better WWE DVDs.",1125360000,,3164,4.177631578947368
2043055,5,B0001Y4LZU,"The Rise and Fall of ECW is a brilliant & emotional look at the world of Extreme Championship Wrestling. It truely hit me deep, being the hometown philly boy, ECW was almost as big as the Eagles. Watching how it all got started from the roots of Eastern Championship Wrestling.

ECW was more than just a turn from Oregon Av to Swanson & Ritner, to a little Bingo Hall in the heart of South Philly. The Philly faithful are the best damn bunch of people you ever want 2 be around. The DVD really tells is like it is. Such memories from the ""Bring Your Weapons"" to the ""Head Phenomenion"". ECW was a perfect blend at the right place & right time.

It's only natural that product of WWE has copied off it, it's all apart of business and when your in profitable business like WWE you need to take what you can get. It's sad that ECW couldn't profit as much, I still miss not seeing it even 4 years later. The New Alhambra AKA The ECW Arena seems to have lost it's appeal since ECW left. The fall part of the DVD really was really sad to think how when Tazz & The Dudleyz left everything went downhill, but I guess it's just business and the strong survive.

This DVD is great a buy, I truely recommend it to all.",1125014400,,1206,4.189655172413793

IT's the sotry of ECW for ECW (including the fans) By ECW.  Although It would have been nice to include comentary by some non-contracted ECW wrestlers (Forever Hardcore covers that base quite nicely) it's still a great DVD.  I also appreciate the fact that they didn't try to stuff as much as they could in the span of only and hour or two.  This Documentary is THREE HOURS LONG, and it fills the time very nicely.

It is sad that they had to fold and that WWE is making them look soft when they could whip the WWE's @ss any day of the week and everyone who knows wrestling knows this. This DVD is good despite the very stupid ""W"" logo of the WWE that stays in the bottom left hand corner ALL THE TIME!!! but this DVD is a must have for anyone who either wants to remember the ECW (like me) or who wants to learn about the best wrestling company EVER!",1118102400,3,547,3.936936936936937

The matches on Disc 2, range from ""OK"" (RVD/Lynn, their match from the previous PPV is better) to mind-numbingly dull (Sabu-Scorpio, which seemed to last for eons). Paul E often had problems booking straight up matches and had 100 people doing run-ins, plus a lot of the guys couldn't actually wrestle.",1117929600,,479,4.635294117647059
2043060,5,B0001Y4LZU,"I remember watching my first ECW Match and having my jaw dropping straight to the floor and since then I have been hooked. When ECW went bankrupt it was not only the saddest day of my life but wrestling in general has never been the same. I do agree there is good wrestling out there with such promotions like Combat Zone Wrestling, Chikara Pro Wrestling or Ring of Honor and others lik the IWS in montreal or the occasional TNA Wrestling Match. But ECW was something special, with the best wrestling, best interviews, most hardcore action you will ever see and the in your face unpredictable action that the WWE couldn't pull off if they tried. With the WWE buying all the rights to ECW I was very happy to learn that they would  be putting out a documentry about the company to give back to the fans. Right away i went to the store and picked this one up.

This is one the best Documentries the WWE has ever made, showcasing the company in its struggle to keep open and how they triumphed to be a contender in the wrestling wars. ECW showcased such stars as Chris Jericho, Two Cold Scorpio, Ron Simmons, Tazz, Sabu, Raven, Chris Beniot, Stone Cold Steve Austin and many others. They cover every point, every struggle, every classic moment that made ECW a top contender. From when the company made the transition from Eastern Championship Wrestling to the Extreme style that started it all. It shows the creative mind of Paul Heyman in full detail and how he changed the wrestling world forever. The downside of the DVD that isn't really even a big downside, is the lack of great matches that could have been put on here to really show new fans of the company the true reason why the company is special. Matches like Stairway to Hell between Sandman and Sabu, or The Double Jeopardy Match with Tommy Dreamer and Sandman vs. Stevie Richards and Brian Lee where Tommy goes through 4 Stacked Tables!!!!, Or Even Sabu And Rob Van Dam vs. Hakushi and Hayabusa. But the match Selection does do injustice and comes with enough commentary to keeps fans intrested. The matches are...

The Pit Bulls vs. Raven & Stevie Richards (2 out of 3 falls Double Dog Collar Match)- Great Match with appearances by Tommy Dreamer, 911 and all the Dudleys. Raven almost gets decapitaded when his head bounces off the side of a table. 5/5

Rey Misterio Jr. vs. Psicosis - Another Great match with lots of high flying that only the lucha-libre can pull off. 5/5

Mikey Whipwreck vs. The Sandman (Ladder Match) - Steve Austin makes an appearance and the match is not that bad. 4/5

2 Cold Scorpio vs. Sabu - Hardcore Mayhem as only ECW could deliever as both men pull off insane high flying moves that makes the match a classic. 5/5

Tommy Dreamer vs. Raven - Lots of Story behind this match as Tommy Dreamer's search is ended after finally pinning Raven. Lots of run in's but hardcore madness at its finist. 4/5

Tazz vs. Bam Bam Bigelow - Kinda a slow match but some crazy bumps. Tazz's commentary even shows hows intense the match is. I think without it the match wouldn't be the same. Match ends with the most shocking moment as Tazz and Bam Bam both go through the ring. 4/5

Rob Van Dam vs. Jerry Lynn - One of RVD's best matches and I believe was voted best match of the year when the match happened. When these two guys get together it a great match and this match shows that. 5/5

If you are a fan of ECW for years or new to the company, buying this DVD would be a great addition to your DVD library. I highly Recommend it and long live Extreme Championship Wrestling!! E-C-W...E-E-W...E-C-W!!!!!",1115510400,6,3580,4.493846153846154
2043061,5,B0001Y4LZU,"...to when ECW was still around! But first...

A. Pierre, we are not ""crying"" about anything. Why certain wrestlers were not interviewed about ECW is a valid point. They seemed to limit it to ex-ECWers who are (or were) in WWE at the time of release of this DVD. I see it as a bit of corporate ego-stroking on the WWE's part. (heh... stroking...)

Anyways...

Ladies and people, what we have here is the history of ECW, as told by those who lived it. I LOVED ECW. It used to come on every Sunday afternoon at 5. Of course, back in those days, every Sunday they'd show SEVEN hours of wrestling every afternoon on one of the stations here in town.

Anyways, there was a lot of stuff about ECW that I did not know. Example: Some of the wrestlers also handled merchandising and booking duties. There was also the story of how their first PPV was canceled, then un-canceled.

The matches on Disc Two were all great matches.

Anyways, a great DVD!

2043062,5,B0001Y4LZU,"This documentary is a breath of fresh air to me, and I assume many other wrestling fans out there lost in this limbo that WWE has created. What you get is a 3 hour program covering a general history of the promotion and a few storyline highlights that occured, all covered with a shocking tenderness that people wouldn't expect from WWE's poduct crew. For folks like me who still throw on old tapes every day, they even include a few of the bigger matches as extras (although folks like me would already own them anyway).

There really isn't much more Heymann and the guys could do with this release without adding on an extra DVD and upping the price. I believe that any casual wrestling fan would be completely satisfied with the documentary, and ECW fans can relive in nostalgia at exactly how hard these guys worked for our entertainment. It will always make me feel good inside when hearing Stevie Richards and the BWO look at Vince McMahon and announce that ""We're taking over!"" This organization alone kept the wrestling industry alive and well throughout the 90's and on.",1110585600,,1079,4.678947368421053
2043063,4,B0001Y4LZU,"I was a Club ECW member, so I have a ALOT of memories about ECW.  So far, I've only gone through disc one and I really loved it.

My MAJOR gripe about the DVD would be the same as any real ECW fan who lived through it.  And that's what I consider the snubbing of some Impact Players (yes it's a pun).  The fact that Francine is not even acknowledged is a shame shame shame. Francine WAS ECW.  Why not mention Jerry Lynn, Justin Credible, Chetti, Doring, Roadkill, Miss Congeniality (Lita), Kid Kash, Hack Myers, Woman, JT Smith, Skull von Krush (lol) and SO many other people.  Why not mention that while we ECW fans were blood-thirsty (not me - not a fan of the blade) we popped like mad for technical matches and many grown men CRIED when Eddie and Dean left?  Why not mention that I always went to the bathroom during New Jack's matches because I was sick and tired of....wait....

Anyway, great DVD.  I suggest buying tapes of ECW TV shows.  Promos were a fun part of the show especially promos from Cactus Jack, Steve Austin & PE.",1109980800,2,1035,4.34375

It covers every wrestler that helped create ECW,on a note to all cry babys who complain about lack of interviews-so what if most of the ECW stars weren't interviewed? The Sandman cant wrestle. I have seen his matches and he is slow and out of shape, New Jack always seems to be in trouble with the law, and Raven and Shane Douglas are under contract to the rival company TNA. The highlights are cool, and the documentary covers basically every major event year by year. Something WWE lacks in every other documentary. The weak point is the matches; I have most of the matches on ECW dvds and agree more RVD or Tazz matches would of made this dvd better. Other then that, the documentary diffently gets 5 stars. I recommend fans who haven't seen ECW before, they'll fall in love after watching the highlights of what this men did to their bodies for fans and love of wrestling.",1109548800,2,937,4.517647058823529
2043065,5,B0001Y4LZU,"Okay, maybe 4.5 stars is more appropriate, I mean there were SO MANY un (eff) ing believable matches in this groups history that I suppose Vinnie Mac figured to focus more on WWE brand talent, or showcase the individuals that the old Whiff had already chewed up and spit out.

I would have preferred some acknowledgement of the Pre-Extreme existence, a picture or two of the late Great Eddie Gilbert, Superfly Snucka as champ, the Don Muraco, then Tito Santana....until the phantom title match where crybaby ""francise"" Douglas (never finished enough schooling to REALLY be called a Dean) took the reigns.

Then again, they get the extra 1/5 star simply because I could see myself in the stands.  Yep, a few away from long time family friend Pete Theophall, opposite side of the ""gang"" with 212 and Dave S.  I can still remember how Paul E. came out the night Sabu went to Japan - and his psychological twist of the crowd to make us even think a Steiner brother would be able to live up to what we craved.",1107302400,3,1004,4.561111111111111
2043066,5,B0001Y4LZU,"I remember the first time I saw ECW.  It was on a small local channel that used to show different independent promotions every night at 11PM.  I happened to be flipping channels and I came across this show.  The episode I happened to see was the one where Shane Douglas won the NWA title and threw it down.  The episode that was the birth of Extreme Championship Wrestling.  I knew I saw something special but I never would have pictured how big it would become.  Back in the days when WWE was pushing Doink, Kamala and all the other ridiculous circus attractions they were known for, back in a day when Hogan had debutted in WCW and they were becoming more of a circus than WWF had ever been, I happened to come across a small promotion that would change the wrestling world.  I fell in love with ECW and once they stopped showing it on the local station I ordered every episode from RF Video.  It was a horrible day when it folded but I'm glad to see it's legacy lives on.

As far as the DVD goes I felt it gave a good summary of what ECW was.  However, there were quite a bit that was never elaborated on in the DVD.  For example, they showed Mickey Whipwreck win the tag team titles.  This came after he won the TV title.  When he held the title he still had never hit a move, and he won every match during his reign because his opponents kept beating on him and would end up getting DQ'd somehow.  At Barely Legal after Taz bet Sabu, RVD attacked him, and Sabu and RVD turned heel and went with Fonzy which bled into the ECW-WWE angle, Taz also turned face in that match.  They never showed how Taz came back and turned heel because he was pissed at the company for bailing on him during his injury.  It's the equivalent of having a WWE history and ignoring Austin's speech at King of the Ring where he invented Stone Cold 3:16. They skipped over most of the last 2 years, never went into the Impact Players, etc.  There was so much they could have added.  For a 2 DVD set where the story is only on the first disk they could have done a lot more.  On the plus side the story is very well done.  I always wondered why they never held another PPV at the ECW Arena and they kinda went into it.

In the DVD McMahon and Bischoff really underplayed how much influence ECW had on the industry.  Maybe, McMahon was telling the truth about WWE not stealing the ECW attitude.  In any case, ECW had shown it was successful and WWE probably would have never tried it without ECW to break it in.  Who knows?  Personally, the concept of Wrestlemania was created by Doctor D David Schultz.  If Vince McMahon could steal his concept, market it as his own, and try to get people to tell him how brilliant he was because of it what does that say about him?",1107129600,,2744,4.2288461538461535
2043067,3,B0001Y4LZU,"Coming from Canada, I wasn't the first on the ECW bandwagon but I have always considered myself a wrestling fan first, not a fan of any one promotion.  This DVD contains more good than bad, but the WWE still manages to stink it up with the ridiculous premise that WWE was a ""friend"" of ECW while portraying WCW and Eric Bischoff as the evil enemies.

This DVD is automatically good simply for the fact that ECW was such compelling entertainment, there is no way even a ham-fisted attempt at capturing its essence could end up being boring.  That said, there were some MAJOR problems that this DVD had.  First, why was there no interview with Raven or Sandman?  It was obviously a prerequisite to be on the WWE payroll for your opinion to count, and it was a little bit sickening to see Paul Heyman, Tazz, etc. sucking up to the McMahon's on this DVD when the very essence of ECW was utter revulsion at the cartoonish stigma WWE had given wrestling.

It was very upsetting that there were no interviews with Raven, Sandman, and of course New Jack, who goes virtually unmentioned on this DVD!  What the hell is up with that?  That in itself deserves a YOU F@CKED UP chant.  This is a disgrace, New Jack is the essence of extreme and delivers some of the finest promos in wrestling, bar none.  Ask yourself this question the next time you see New Jack speak, do you believe he might seriously injure whoever he is threatening to hurt?  Yes.  How many other guys in wrestling can you say that about?  Pretty well zero.

What about Sandman and Raven?  Their matches are represented on this DVD, but where were the opinions of these hardcore icons?  Did they break their bodies in vain?

There is a LOT more to ECW than what you see on these DVD's.  Do yourselves a favour and pick up some of the Pioneer DVD's.  There is a lot more to this revolutionary organization than what is contained here.  You won't be sorry.",1107129600,2,1911,4.468208092485549
2043068,4,B0001Y4LZU,"I am impressed that WWE did as good a job as they did.  While there are flaws, I will address those in a bit, overall this is a very good portrayal of the little company that could.  With the exception of its portrayal of WCW it avoids the re-writing of history that flawed Monday Night Wars.  It is easy to see the passion that most of the boys had for the company.  Taz(z) breaking down is proof enough.

The people they use to retell the history are knowledgable and for the most part do so as a shoot.  However, one of the chief flaws of this production is the abscence of the non WWE boys-Gordon, Raven, Sabu, Sandman and Shane.  I understand why these people weren't used but it's not a complete history without these contributors, especially Tod Gordon.

The other flaw, IMHO, is the match selection.  While these were good matches they just didn't deliver the 'edge' that the company was, be it violent or technical.  That is the reason for only 4 stars.  Granted, with all the Coliseum DVDs on the market, do a ECW search on Amazon, it is easy for anyone to watch some of the finest matches in America in the last dozen years (pre ROH, again IMHO).

Overall, this may be the best wrestling DVD produced.  It's an amazing trip down memory lane and does its part to make sure that ECW's contribution is never forgotten.",1106179200,,1326,4.429752066115703

If you want to know what Jerry Lawler and Erik Bischof thought about ECW, then this is your DVD!  If you want to hear from Sabu, Joey Styles, Shane Douglas (like Vince would let that happen!), Raven, Sandman, Jerry Lynn et all, or anyone who isn't currently under contract by WWE give a true 3rd party (seeing as how it's long dead) view of ECW then you are S.O.L.  But what do Sabu and Shane Douglas know about ECW anyway, let's interview Dawn Marie (can't for the life of me understand why HHH doesn't weigh in on this too!).

I really liked how all throughout WCW is potrayed as some evil opportunists while WWF and Vince are the benevolent diety that looked after ECW, oh please.

Buy anyone of the Pioneer ECW DVDs before you waste your money on this insipid, vapid, piece of over-produced fluff, which is everything ECW wasn't.

If you're more of a casual ECW fan, like myself, this is a DVD to rent instead of buying. The documentary is very good. But once I was done watching it, after burning $25 to do so, I thought to myself, ""hmmm, I can't see myself ever wanting to watch that again."" It's not worth dropping more than $15 on if you're a casual ECW fan. The only problem I had with the documentary is that it jumps from topic to topic without creating a detailed time line of what happened when; Instead, it jumps from wrestler to wrestler, documenting the stamp each man had on the company. Days later, I recall nothing that motivates me to want to watch the DVD again except the closing quote from Paul Heyman, which is so incredibly inspirational and clearly defines him as an individual.

Make no doubt about it, ECW lived up to its tagline

""The leader of Extreme"" wrestling put up fabulous show despite a low budget (many of these shows looked like and were filmed in run down arenas).

I liked the way they also played classic matches from the era, so if your new to ECW and wondered if the hype about is real, then youll see it is.

Its great to see the interviews too explaining how they did certain storyline, Steve Austin's reign in ECW, which basically was a crybaby gimmick cheapshotting Eric Bischoff for firing

of WCW, but it lead to Austin being a bigger star.

We see the evolution the Lucha Libre wrestling invading

2043072,4,B0001Y4LZU,"The now infamous chant of EC-Dub has been silenced by the closing of the company and the end of what was an innovator in the world of professional wrestling. I have been a fan of ECW since mid-98 and after seeing the likes of Sabu, Tommy Dreamer, The Sandman, The Living Legend Terry Funk and The Legendary tag-teams 'The Public Enemy' (RIP Rocco Rock) and 'The Dudley Boys' who willingly put their body's on the line for the sport they love, I was hooked on ECW, whether it was the violence, the un-scripted promos, the amazing commentary from Joey Styles or the innovation of matches like the 'Triple Threat' which if it wasn't for ECW, WWE wouldn't have been using the 'Triple Threat' until later on. ECW even held the first 'Tai Pei Death Match' where both wrestlers tape their fists, then dip them into glue and then into broken-glass, a match type so violent it was not done again until CZW made it's presence known. ECW also made the 'Stairway to Hell'(a ladder match with barb-wire hung above the ring) famous even though a memorable 6-man tag match including current WWE superstars 'The Dudley Boys, Tommy Dreamer and Spike Dudley from A Matter Of Respect 1998 was not included in the extra matches. The first disc contains the history with interviews from former ECW veterans like Taz and Tommy Dreamer and the second disc contains 7 bonus matches such Rob Van Dam vs. Jerry Lynn and Tommy Dreamer vs. Raven. One problem I have is that the DVD ends where Tommy Dreamer became the ECW World Heavyweight Champion, there is nothing about Justin Credible challenging and defeating Dreamer only 22 minutes after Dreamer won the title and there is nothing about Rhyno winning the title and being the last champion which to me puts Rhyno down as a great talent (who I don't think is getting the respect from WWE that he deserves) or the very last ECW PPV where all the ECW regulars gathered in the ring to say goodbye as the infamous chant of EC-dub filled the Hammerstein ballroom to end an era I will certainly not forget for a long time to come.

I was hesitant to think WWE would do ECW any justice because of their track record of presenting their version of wrestling history, but I was pleasanly surprised. Watching the documentary brought back so many memories and made me realize how much I miss ECW and how horrendous the current state of wrestling is. ECW were the true innovators and gave wrestling the kick in the a** it sorely needed. The documentary alone is worth the purchase of this disc. The bonus matches selected, with the exception of Sabu V. 2 Cold Scorpio, seemed to be selected to showcase best of moments for current WWE talent. No match with the Dudleys is bad enough, but no Shane Douglas match is just criminal. Douglas was the cornerstone for ECW for several years and the greatest champion in the history of the company. That aside, I highly recommend this look back at my favorite fed. It's a great look back for longtime fans and fans who didn't see ECW and want to know what all the fuss was about.

2043075,5,B0001Y4LZU,"The Rise and Fall of ECW is one of the most superb and well produced documentary film I have ever watched. The quality is professional, the content is mostly unbiased(given the fact that WWF produced it) and information is well presented that even a person unfamiliar with ECW could understand this revolutionary phenomenon.

I love hardcore wrestling and thus obviously was an ECW fan and was disappointed that ECW had to shut down. Although a couple of my friends were really hardcore ECW fans who could tell you literally everything about ECW. Even then I found these DVD's very useful.

ECW revolutionized pro-wrestling. They brought *Hardcore* to the wrestling world. It attracted fans who had become bored of soap-operish nonsense of mainstream wrestling. ECW wrestlers gave all they had for the fans, for the company and for the sport itself.

The DVD has lots of interviews, footage, storylines and angles so that anybody, even without prior knowledge, could understand and truly appreciate the greatness and the hardcoreness of ECW. The second DVD also includes 7 matches but they are certainly not the best ECW has had. Although this is not as much of a big deal since ECW's tapes are availaible from Amazon.com and other places.

One thing that annoyed me was the fact that there was no interview with people like The Sandman and Sabu who are not in the WWF as of now. Those two wrestlers are on par with the people like Bret Hart and The Undertaker but in their own way.

If you want to get the best of ECW watch Sandman vs Sabu, Stairway to Hell match. That is my all time ECW favorite.

Also, I can attest to the fact that ECW! ECW! EC DUB! EC DUB! chants are still heard in areans across the country. I went to watch an Indy promotion, RoH(Ring of Honor) and everytime an ECW wrestler would show up, the chants of ECW! ECW! would begin in earnest.

2043076,5,B0001Y4LZU,"I finally had a chance to see this video after weeks of finding them sold out in stores or backordered online. It was worth the wait and it didn't disappoint.

""The Rise and Fall of ECW"" shows ECW from the insider point of view, from the people who had personally been involved with ECW. Some of the biggest names in WWE and WCW history had a run in ECW (Steve Austin, Benoit, Jericho just to name a few) and many more current WWE stars were former ECW superstars.

The first DVD contains the history of ECW, interviews with the creator/promoter of ECW, Paul Heyman, ECW long time alumni Tommy Dreamer, Taz and The Dudleys, those who knew ECW the best. Vince McMahon and Eric Bischoff both throw in their perspective of ECW and what they thought of the promotion at the time, was it a legitimate threat or competition to WCW or WWE.

The second DVD has some of their classic ""hardcore"" matches (too many to choose from) but they narrowed it down to few of them. I didn't have the chance to see all of the matches but I really liked the ""RVD versus Jerry Lynn"" match and Tas versus Bam Bam Bigelow (too short but the finish was fantastic). There is also commentary from both Taz and RVD during the match.

ECW was really the stepping stone for WWE's attitude era, as ECW innovated some of the most creative not familar to WWE or WCW. For example, the frequent use of tables, vicious looking piledrivers/suplexes, use of sexual innunendo, ladders, etc. There shows were really enjoyable and they provided the right balance of wrestling, from high flying cruiserweights, straight out technical wrestling, hardcore matches, gimmick matches.

The DVD helped me really get to know ECW better then I knew before and it was a very interesting and engaging documentary. You will not be disappointed in this DVD set. It's amazing how Paul Heyman and his wrestlers put together such a enjoyable, innovate product compared to WCW or WWE at the time.

FOR SOME REASON, THIS DVD IGNORES EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED AFTER TOMMY DREAMER FINALLY CAPTURED THE ECW WORLD TITLE FROM TAZZ BACK IN 2000. YOU MEANING TO TELL ME THE WWE COULDN'T TALK ABOUT HOW JUSTIN CREDIBLE BEAT TOMMY DREAMER FOR THAT ECW TITLE LATER THAT SAME NIGHT AND THEY COULDN'T TALK ABOUT HOW JUSTIN CREDIBLE EVEN THREW DOWN HIS HALF OF THE ECW WORLD TAG TEAM TITLE RIGHT AFTER HE WON THE ECW TITLE FROM TOMMY DREAMER? CMON! EVERYBODY SHOULD KNOW TOMMY DREAMER WAS NOT THE LAST ECW WORLD CHAMPION! RHYNO WAS! AND I'M QUITE DISSAPOINTED TO SEE THAT THE WWE LEFT OUT THE LAST NINE MONTHS OF ECW'S EXISTENCE.

2. THE WWE DOESN'T ACKNOWLEDGE JUSTIN CREDIBLE ON THIS DVD. ALL WE SEE OF JUSTIN CREDIBLE ON THIS DVD IS A FEW HIGHLIGHTS OF HIM TEAMING WITH LANCE STORM. JUSTIN CREDIBLE [AS I JUST SAID] WON THE ECW WORLD TITLE AND KEPT THAT BELT FOR 6 MONTHS, HE HELD THE TAG TITLES WITH LANCE STORM [WHO DOES GET SCREEN TIME ON THIS DVD] TWICE, AND HE HAD 2 MEMORABLE MATCHES WITH TOMMY DREAMER [ONE AT LIVING DANGEROUSLY '98 AND THE OTHER AT HEATWAVE 2000].

3. THE WWE DOESN'T ACKNOWLEDGE TAJIRI ENOUGH ON THIS DVD. TAJIRI FACED TAZZ FOR THE ECW WORLD TITLE AT HEATWAVE 99, HE HELD THE TAG TEAM TITLE WITH MIKEY WHIPWRECK, AND HE HELD THE TV TITLE.

4. ON THE 2ND DVD, WHICH CONTAINS BONUS MATCHES, A LOT OF CLASSIC ECW MATCHES DIDN'T MAKE THE CUT. INSTEAD, WE ARE GIVEN 7 ECW MATCHES WHICH ARE NOT BAD, BUT THEY FAIL TO SHOWCASE ECW'S FULL POTENTIAL. THE ONLY 2 MATCHES THAT DID DESERVE TO BE SHOWN IN THEIR ENTIRITIES ON THIS DVD ARE ROB VAN DAM VS. JERRY LYNN AND TAZZ VS. BAM BAM BIGELOW. THESE MATCHES SHOULD'VE BEEN ON THE 2ND DVD IN ADDITION TO THOSE TWO:

1. STAIRWAY TO HELL MATCH FOR THE ECW WORLD TITLE
CHAMPION JUSTIN CREDIBLE VS. TOMMY DREAMER FROM HEATWAVE 2000

2. STAIRWAY TO HELL MATCH
SABU VS. THE SANDMAN FROM A 1998 EPISODE OF ECW

3. THE GREAT SASUKE, GRAN HAMADA, & YAKASIJI VS. TAKA MICHINOKU, DICK TOGO, & TERRY BOY FROM BARELY LEGAL

4. 2 OUT OF 3 FALLS MATCH
DEAN MALENKO VS. EDDIE GUERRERO FROM A 1995 EPISODE OF ECW

5. I QUIT MATCH
TOMMY DREAMER VS. C.W. ANDERSON FROM GUILTY AS CHARGED 2001

6. 4 CORNERS MATCH FOR THE ECW TV TITLE
CHAMPION CHRIS JERICHO VS. 2 COLD SCORPIO VS. SHANE DOUGLAS VS. PIT BULL II FROM A 1996 EPISODE OF ECW

7. FOR THE ECW WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT TITLE
CHAMPION SHANE DOUGLAS VS. TAZZ FROM LIVING DANGEROUSLY 99

8. TOMMY DREAMER VS. BRIAN LEE FROM A 1995 EPISODE OF ECW

THAT'S WHAT SHOULD'VE BEEN THE 2ND DISC.

OH, AND THE WWE ALSO FAILS TO ACKNOWLEDGE STEVE CORINO, RHYNO, DANNY DORING & ROADKILL, THE TRIPLE THREAT, AND THEY FAIL TO ACKNOWLEDGE MASATO TANAKA.

OVERALL, THIS DVD IS QUITE ENTERTAINING IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT ECW OR DIDN'T GET TO SEE ECW WHEN IT WAS ON THE AIR. BUT, DIE-HARD ECW FANS MIGHT NOT APPRECIATE SOME OF THE FLAWS THAT PLAGUES THE STORYTELLING OF THIS DOCUMENTARY. IF THIS DOESN'T APPEAL TO YOU, TRY ANY ONE OF THE PIONEER-RELEASED ECW DVDS. THE DVD IS DEFINITELY WORTH AT LEAST ONE LOOK.",1103846400,2,3686,4.368421052631579
2043078,5,B0001Y4LZU,I just got this in the mail earlier today.  There are no words to describe this DVD.  I didn't know alot about ECW before viewing this DVD.  A must have for any Wrestling fan.,1102982400,,175,4.088235294117647
2043079,5,B0001Y4LZU,"I have my copy on order but I have already watched it and I assure you that this is well worth your hard earned money if you are a wrestling fan. The first disc is a near three hour account of the fed that changed wrestling from 1993-2001. It took a long time to get ECW in syndication on the stations in my area but when I finally got to watch ECW in 1996, I seen what all the hype was about. The first disc has interviews with the likes of former ECW owner Paul Heyman, Tazz, Tommy Dreamer, The Dudley Boyz, Steven Richards, Lance Storm, Rob Van Dam, Rhyno, Chris Jericho, Chris Benoit, Eddie Guerrero, Rey Mysterio, Nunzio,and Dawn Marie, all of whom where employed by ECW at one time or another. Also interviews Kurt Angle, who was within an eyelash of being signed  by ECW before he signed with the WWE, which is an interesting story in itself, Jerry Lawler, who was lent to ECW by Vince in order to hype there second ppv, and interviews the head of the two companies ECW was competing against, Vince McMahon with WWE and Eric Bischoff, who is a former GM of WCW. You can see the respect Vince had for Paul but you can see the obvious disdain Eric and Paul had for each other. This first disc chronicles ALMOST every major superstar in ECW, and is worth the price alone.

The second disc contains seven bonus matches, all which are classics. It disappoints me because they could have easily made this a three disc set like the Ric Flair DVD but who knows, with the success of this dvd, maybe there will be a volume two worth of matches put out by WWE in the future. The Seven matches include:

Raven and Stevie Richards vs. The Pit Bulls in a two out of three dog collar match for the ECW tag team belts: This match is a perfect start to show the chaos of ECW. Great brawl. Look for an appearence by the seldom remembered Dudley Dudley and Dances with Dudley.

Rey Mysterio Jr. vs. Psychosis in a two out of three falls match: This is the match that set the pace of cruiserweight action in America. These two were lent to ECW by Konnan, who owned a Mexican wrestling company, and this match is one of the reasons Eric Bischoff and WCW started signing crusierweights away from Mexico, Japan, and ECW. The match itself will leave you speechless.

Mikey Whipwreck vs. The Sandman in a ladder match for the ECW Heavyweight title: Match is probably under ten minutes long but it is brutal and it is very entertaining. Best part is the ring introductions when ""Superstar"" Steve Austin cuts an in ring promo that was an instant classic and showed the world that WCW had misused this individual.

2 Cold Scorpio vs. Sabu for the ECW TV title: Great high flying match featuring one of the most underated wrestlers in Scorpio, and the man who brought attention to ECW, Sabu. If you are one of the younger fans or an older fan who has never watched Sabu, this is the match for you.

Tommy Dreamer vs. Raven: This is the final match in a feud that lasted from 1994 to this match that took place in May of 1997. A brutal, hardcore match that doesn't mean much if you don't know the history of this feud, which is why I urge you to watch disc one before you watch this match.

Tazz vs. Bam Bam Bigelow for the ECW TV title: Probably the weakest match on the DVD. I think for a Tazz match, they should have shown his match with Sabu at ECW's first ppv. Still an entertaing match for those of you that only know Tazz as Smackdown's color commentator.

Rob Van Dam vs. Jerry Lynn for the ECW TV title: Best match on the DVD in my opinion. For those of you like me that think RVD is being robbed by being pushed back in WWE and that his talent is misused, wait till you see what he does in this match. This is an example of why RVD is one of the better performers today and will make you wonder why he doesn't get to do some of the in ring spots in WWE, that he does in this match.

There is three interview extras on Disc 2 that features Stevie Richards, Tazz, and Chris Jericho.

Classic collection. Only drawbacks is no mention of The Eliminators, no match featuring the Dudleys, and there is no mention of the best heel faction in ECW, The Triple Threat which was helmed by Shane Douglas.

A must buy.",1101686400,24,4192,4.285714285714286
2043080,4,B0001Y4LZU,"I'm an ECW fan since I first saw them on Boston area TV in 1996. I went to about a dozen Boston area shows and continued to watch and record the TV shows religiously into 1999 when the product started to suffer. I ate this DVD up. Disc one is awesome but there were many more characters I wished would have been represented. You guys touched on some of the biggest omissions already. The Gangstas, The Eliminators, The Full Blooded Italians, Joel Gertner, and FRANCINE ""The Queen of Extreme"" were criminally underrepresented. And even though these six Japanese performers made only a few performances, what about the amazing showcase of talent from Great Sasuke, Gran Hamada, Gran Naniwa, Taka Michinoku, Sho Funaki, and Dick Togo? The personalities who are covered most on this DVD are those under WWE contract, so what about Funaki? And is Taka Michinoku still under contract?

All in all, this is a must-have DVD for ECW fans who might not own any other ECW DVDs, like me.",1101168000,2,975,4.701754385964913
2043081,3,B0001Y4LZU,"I for one would have gave this video five stars if it had shown the proper respect to Shane ""the Francise"" Douglas! The ""Francise"" carried ECW on his back during the glory years. He rated more than 15 minutes! I know that Shane Douglas had heat with Vince McMahon. And I know that Paul Heyman owed Shane a large some of money. And I know that the WWE only puts out its version of wrestling history. But come on! Those of us that were ECW fans know that Shane Douglas had a huge impact on ECW and erasing his contributions only hurts the DVD and insults the ECW fan! This DVD should have been the ultimate ECW history DVD tribute!",1101081600,5,629,4.25
2043082,5,B0001Y4LZU,"ECW was the best thing to ever happen to wrestling. The passion, violence, athleticism and characters were all wrestling's best. It its ironic that the company with the least promotion and pay scale could have invented many concepts that are taken today. The only problem I have with this DVD is that for one it doesn't talk to people not hired by WWE such The Sandman, Raven, The Franchise, New Jack etc. It also doesn't contain original music. The music was a heightener of ECW's greatness but is overdubbed. The DVD also ends when Dreamer won the ECW title. Unfortunately it ceases to mention that Justin Credible hit the ring and beat him for the belt after his speech. It also doesn't show Sandman's return to the company which I believe is the best moment in ECW history. It would have also been good to see footage of the mass transit incident, the last ECW show and the last ECW Arena where everyone threw their chair in the ring (I was lucky enough to be there. the matches are good but should have included The Gangstas vs Dvon and Mass Transit and the stairway to hell match between Sandman and Sabu which was the best match ECW ever had. Wrestling isn't anywhere as good as the days of Extreme Championship Wrestling and never will be.",1100995200,8,1247,4.546666666666667
2043083,5,B0001Y4LZU,"Now I was only a kid when ECW was in its prime so I really didn't see most of it. But after I saw the WWE realease this DVD I immediately went out and bought it. This is an awsome documentary of the rise and fall of a great brand of wrestling.

Paul Heyman took a small not well known company and in a few years turned it into one of the most unbelievable shows ever seen. ECW had only a few hundred fans in the back of a bingo hall in one room, and they didn't have enough money for lights and pyro shows.

But Heyman didn't let that stop him, he stayed away from what they lacked and went on to what they did best at, guys putting other guys through tables set on fire.

This almost 3 hour documentary comes with jawdropping moments ever seen. From the Dudley boys starting riots from insulting people, to Shane Douglas throwing the NWA world title belt on the ground and saying he would rather be the ECW champion. And even to where the crowd threw hundreds of styrafoam heads into the ring with Al Snow.

The Documentary goes from all the major ECW superstars one by one. Raven, Tazz, Tommy Dreamer, The Sandman, Cactus Jack, Sabu, The Dudleys, Rob Van Dam, and others. It even goes to the moments where Kurt Angle was supposed to work for ECW but changed his mind after a really religious/horrifying moment.

It also goes onto an argument between Paul Heyman and Eric Bischoff where Heyman accused Bischoff of raiding their superstars to join WCW. Bischoff declared that the Superstars left to get a better deal. Heyman declared, point blank, that Bischoff was full of sh*t.

The last moments of the documentary are great, as each superstar gives their personal feelings about working at ECW and how they were saddened by the loss of it. I gave this 4 stars just for the documentary alone.

The last star was for the matches on it. Though I have to admit I wished there were at least twice as many as there were on the disk. Anyway the three best matches on the disk are...

Sabu vs. Too Cold Scorpio: A 30 minute match where both men took crazy high flying moves. Sabu gives an insane table bump after leaping off a chair, onto the top rope, then doing a summersault in the air and crashed onto a table. Great match and the ending is surprising. 9/10

Rey Mysterio vs. Physcosis: A great high flying match with the crusierweights. All over the arena they fought, with moves over barriers and off of walls. A great match and the crowd was into it as always. 9/10

The Pit Bulls vs. Raven and Steven Richards: This was a two out of three dog collar match. It means that Raven would be linked to one of the pit bulls by the neck with a collar and chain as would steven richards be with the other pit bull.

four or five tables were broken in this one, and Raven's head clips the side of another table after the pit bull missed putting him through the table. Tommy Dreamer makes an appearance as do the dudley boys. 10/10

I would definately reccomend this just for the documentary alone, it is one of the best DVD's ever made by the WWE.",1100908800,29,3040,4.332746478873239
2043084,5,B0001Y4LZU,"The Rise and Fall of ECW is without a doubt the best DVD the WWE has ever produced.  Sure the Ric Flair Collection and Chris Benoit DVD had better matches, but the main feature in ""The Rise and Fall of ECW"" is just amazing.  At 2hr. 50 minutes, they are able to tackle the important issues.  You get the feeling that another disc could have been used.  The main feature shows real emotion from all the former employees of ECW.  You really get a background on just how much they cared for the company.  The Double DVD also comes with a disc full of matches.  People who have purchased the Pioneer ECW releases probably have 4 of the matches, but they don't feel like retreads.  3 of the 4 matches have audio commentary on them.  The commentary with Michael Cole and Rob Van Dam is hilarious.  RVD is so funny to listen to.  In many ways he seems like a fan. He is always noting a cool move while discussing the match and ECW in general. Here are the matches!

*Raven & Stevie Richards v. The Pitbulls- 2/3 Falls Double Dog Collar Match -ECW Gangstas Paradise 1995: This is solid match with epic heat.  The story behind the match makes it a historic match. So many storylines seem to be built into this one 20 minute match.  People who only like scientific matches may balk at the action, but still extremely enjoyable.  ****

*Rey Misterio, Jr. v. Psicosis- 2/3 Falls -ECW Arena 1995: This is an amazing match, in my opinion, the best these two ever had.  The action is off the charts.  You really get to see just how good Rey Misterio, Jr. was before injuries took him down a notch.  Psicosis is really impressive as well in the match.  Overall, just an off the charts match, probably the best on the DVD.  ****1/2

*The Sandman v. Mikey Whipwreck- Ladder Match for ECW Championship: Before the match you get the Extreme Superstar Steve Austin doing an in-ring promo.  Austin's character in ECW provided some of the greatest worked/shoot type promos ever.  He bashes Whipwreck, Sandman & Woman.  The match is only about 7 or 8 minutes long, but really brutal.  Sandman takes a ladder shot flush in the face from a foot away.  ***

*Sabu v. 2 Cold Scorpio- ECW Televison Championship- Cyberslam 1996:  This is a very good match that I have never previously seen.  I had heard about how good it was.  I have to admit that its not quite as good as I heard it was, but I'm being pretty picky. Sabu and 2 Cold Scorpio really put their bodies on the line in this match.  Some of the manuevers are breathtaking.  Overall its a very good match, that's only a few mistakes and missed spots away from being a near classic.  ****

*Tommy Dreamer v. Raven- WrestlePalooza 97: This is the final battle and really a good ECW style brawl.  Some of the moves are just sick.  The story of the match also makes it really good.  The question was whether Tommy could finally beat Raven.  Really solid stuff.  ***1/2

*Taz v. Bam Bam Bigelow- ECW Television Championship-Living Dangerously 1998.  Really decent match with the insane ending.  This would have been better placed only in the documentary.  Not really up to the standards of the other matches.  **1/2

*Rob Van Dam v. Jerry Lynn- ECW Television Championship-Hardcore Heaven 99.  I believe that this is not their best match.  Their match from Living Dangerously 99 and their 9/10/99 match from the ECW Arena were better.  Still, this is an amazing athletic match.  The two participants really put it all on the line.  Lynn actually gets knocked out 5 minutes into the match, but still gives it his all.  The manuevers in the match are pretty great.  You wouldn't see the WWE give these two the kind of time to do a match like this.  Overall, really good match ****

Overall, great DVD definitely check it out!!!",1100822400,10,3751,4.517910447761194
2043085,4,B0001Y4LZU,"Sitting back and watching this DVD made me realize just how much I miss the old ECW days. This is actually the first time in awhile that I've been excited to pick up a wrestling-related product. While it is being released by Vince McMahon and the WWE, this documentary chronicling the origin and demise of Paul Heyman's Extreme Championship Wrestling is actually quite an insightful look at the company. All of the newly-recorded interviews for ""Rise & Fall Of ECW"" are conducted only with ECW talent that is signed to WWE so you won't be hearing any new commentary from Joey Styles, Raven, or Shane Douglas to name a few. The talent involved which includes Paul Heyman, Tommy Dreamer, Tazz, Rob Van Dam, The Dudley Boyz, and Stevie Richards actually do an excellent job of telling the story. Vince McMahon and Eric Bischoff also provide their own comments from the perspective of rival companies, the WWF and WCW. My biggest pet-peeve is that the company workers refeer to past-tense WWF by its current ""WWE"" title. Other than that, I enjoyed every moment of this DVD.

The second disc of ""Rise + Fall"" features seven classic ECW matches, complete with original commentary from Joey Styles (though the non-licenesed theme music has been altered and a WWE logo is present in the left corner). Three of the matches feature alternate commentary from the participants though it often comes off ""uneven"" as half of the time the wrestlers tell the stories from the point-of-view of their characters and the rest of the time, they tell from a ""kayfabe"" stance. The second disc is a bit underwhelming as the matches are hardly some of ECW's best.

All in all, this disc is easily worth the purchase if you're a true ECW fan though if you're really looking to go through the true ECW experience, I would recommend trying to obtain some of Pioneer's commercially-released ECW DVD's.",1100736000,10,1873,4.813664596273292

2043088,4,B0001Y4LZU,"I was never a big fan of ECW during its prime. When I first discovered it, back in I think 1995, I thought it was interesting because it was so much more out of control than the then WWF, but I was hardly consider myself a fan.

This DVD however was interesting to me. Since there is no competition anymore, I wanted to see and hear why ECW was considered so great. Done with the DVD production that only the WWE can do.

The actual feature is just shy of 3 hours, and is very involved. It goes into all aspects of the company and talks with all the major players involved. I really enjoyed the frankness that Tommy Dreamer, Taz, Bischoff, Vince and Paul Heyman all talked about the product. Many guys you can tell miss it. It was great to see a guy like Heyman, with such a vision and a passion to make his idea grow, and it takes a hell of a man to admit when it's over.

This takes a look at just about the entire run of ECW from the inception to the first pay per view to the closing of it's doors and Paul Heyman emerging in the WWE. It is very hard to say how well this is all put together, but it is done really well.

For true fans there might be things missing, but I personally felt that I now understand why it was so popular, and quite honestly after seeing it, you can see especially now how watered down the WWE is, not so much the wrestling, but the characters. You also can truly feel how influential they were in changing the style of wrestling and use of talent. A very gracious Rey Mysterio Jr. thanks Paul Heyman for being involved in getting his name known in the states.

The DVD goes into history of angles, and how certain stories were told. To hear Heyman talk with such passion, this is a man that loved wrestling. You can tell he hates to see it go. If the WWE was smart this guy would be the top creative guy, he has vision, just don't let him near the money.

Do I wish there was more? Of course. This could have easily been a 3-disc set. I wish there was more RVD and I wish more time was spent of Steve Austin. Chris Jericho talks about ECW, but unfortunately he doesn't get a match on the disc (maybe they'll put one on his DVD one day) As for the extras, well I haven't watched them yet, but I can tell you I would have enjoyed seeing a lot more RVD, especially the RAW match from 1997 vs. Jeff Hardy (I know that wasn't exactly an ECW match, but it was during the cross promotion era) I would love to have that match in DVD quality. Plus I think that at a mere 7 matches, that does not do justice to showing what ECW is all about.

There is way to much to cover and I'm sure some other folks will fill you in, but i just want to say that the last minute and a half of the movie with Paul E. Heyman has to be some of the most inspiring words I have ever heard.  I'm not joking.  He literally almost choked me up.  Also, I bought my copy at a record store and got a kick ssa ECW  barbed wire logo skull cap.  Keep that in mind.  One complaint though...why no mention of Justin Credible or my favorite female wrestler of all time, Lita (Miss Congeniality or Anjelica in ECW)?  Both were major players in the rise of ECW, and Lita, of course is employed by the WWE now and they had everyone alse who is now in WWE in the interviews.  That just struck me as odd.  Also, I was at the Sabu beneifit show in Detroit in December, and there were ECW chants the whole night.  (I updated this review in January of 2005)",1100649600,,946,4.059459459459459
2043091,5,B0001Y4LZU,"ECW was a revolution in the wrestling world that still goes underrated to this very day in terms of the impact it had.  It introduced the world to madcap capers of Hardcore wrestling, it brought wrestling to the 18-34 male demograph, it introduced to a certain extent real wrestling to the public.

This DVD covers the entire lifespan of ECW from it's indie days all the way to it tragic end.  From nothing to PPV to TNN ECW had a long run.

In terms of who they interview they only talked to (from those who were in ECW) only the guys who are in WWE at current time.  So in terms of some of the history you get to hear from Tommy Dreamer, Paul Heyman, Taz, the Dudly Boyz and so on.  It would of been nice to hear from other big names, non-WWE guys such as Sabu, Raven, and Sandman but you can't get everthing.

Probably the only disapointment is the second Disk of the DVD.  There are only a few matches (I believe only 6) and deleted moments.  There is such a rich history of ECW you would of thought they put more effort into finding matchs that showed what ECW was about.  But then again each big match had such buildup to it that they might be afraid would confuse the audience.

Overall however this is a very well done, and put together documentary.  Some may criticize WWE for making half assed documentary DVD on certain aspects of Wrestling History, but this one does the legacy of ECW justice and after watching it makes me wish I was part of it (from a fan standpoint).  I kind of wish I would have found a way to watch it and been part of it.  However the past is the past and even today the effects of ECW still hold today.  Be warned however there is really strong language in this and very graphic violence (lot's and lot's of blood).
