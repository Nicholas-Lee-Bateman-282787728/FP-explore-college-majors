5101531,5,B007OBZD4G,"This is so heartbreaking.  This was one of the best tv shows ever.  The music was great plus they bought back some older and almost forgotten Actors.  The stories were very profound and yet done so easily understood.  The cast was the best around.  And now they cut it down to only Friday evenings.  The main star was not famous, but she played the part as a very feminine looking lady,  but when upset,  grew inches above whoever she was up against. The two heavy set gentlemen,  were not pretty boys,  but could act with a blink of the eye. There are so many new shows on the air,  and they really leave us pondering why they are on the air.  I am willing to send many letters about getting this show on DVDs,  but do you truly believe they would listen?  Someone get back to this subject  and let us all know.  I believe it is worth fighting for!  Please don't let this great show become a Cold Case.",1361750400,88,903,4.2176470588235295
5101532,5,B007OBZD4G,"Okay, I found this on another web site as to why these DVDs may not be available:
[...]

As you may already know, the television series Cold Case is not available on home video.

The story most people hear is that `music licensing issues' are stopping the DVDs from being produced. According to these reports on the Internet, some of the songs used in the show have been licensed only for television broadcast and not for home video. For the studios to use the music in DVDs, they must pay `hefty' royalties to the musicians and record companies. These additional fees are so incredibly high--some of these stories say--that the studios won't be able to sell the DVDs at any reasonable price.

It seems that this is only partially true.

The story appears to have two origins in mid-2005 after the end of Season Two. One source is from a chat between a Cold Case fan and an executive from Warner Brothers. The other source was from a reply by ""InsideR""--a studio inside source--on the Look Again message board.

Recently in 2006, Look Again board member JazzyB asked InsideR again how to get legitimate Cold Case DVDs, and our situation seems to have improved:

Mar 7, 2006, 7:33pm, JazzyB wrote:

  Since the DVD release of `Cold Case' may never see the light of day, how would the enterprising fan acquire a copy of edits, re-shot scenes, etc.? Legally, of course.

The response from InsideR on Mar 15, 2006 was:

  The best things the fans can do is to write and email Warners and CBS begging them to release the DVD. If they think they'll sell enough, they'll find a way to solve the licensed music problems.

  Same goes for a soundtrack album.
  --R

Folks, isn't it about time we show Warner Brothers, CBS, and Bruckheimer Films that a lot of viewers are interested in purchasing Cold Case DVDs? And a soundtrack album too, while they're at it? That's what this web site is all about.",1354492800,284,1891,4.591044776119403
5101533,5,B007OBZD4G,"WHY IN THE BLOOMING HECK IS THIS SUPERB TV SERIES NOT AVAILABLE ON DVD?????

I'm from Australia and my mum and I are extreme fans of this fantastic tv series, i just don't know WHY they can't box set it. Why they do films such as this and many other tv shows have a great run on tv, lasting 6 seasons and then poof wait and wait wait for it to be available on dvd. So us THE CONSUMERS have no way of owning legitimate copies for themselves.

It's the same with so many shows, dating back to the 80's & 90's....... The Nanny made 6 seasons in mid-late 90's til the early 00's - only have brought out 3 seasons so far......... Tour of Duty made tons of episodes which could easily have been edited into 2-3 seasons - only a couple available on vhs.........Third Watch made abouts 4 seasons which ended in early 00's - only have 2 seasons available......

PLEASE DOES ANYBODY HAVE AN ANSWER TO THIS ALARMING QUESTION? I am dvd-aholic and i'm sure i'm not the only one frustrated by this......films/tv shows fans want to have the full-set to their favourites, and not be cheated out.",1352332800,47,1079,4.358208955223881

5101538,5,B007OBZD4G,"This show had a great cast of charactors. It had great stories with interesting plots and various twists & turns.  AND, it didn't always have a happy ending.  More realistic than most police shows.  I can't understand why it went off the air and why there are no DVD's or instant video available. If CBS really wanted to, I'm sure they could find a way to make it available.  If CBS can offer Beverly Hillbillies and Green Acres, they should be willing to offer Cold Case",1434844800,5,471,4.441860465116279

The review I read that two or three months before mine said it straight.  ""Most of use who enjoyed all of the series will either be dead or incapacitated.""  And this Series (Cold Case) will not appeal to this new generation and the generation after them.  They like gross Horror Movies, Party Down South, etc.  This will not put money in your pocket books.  You should start reevaluating this situation.

5101544,5,B007OBZD4G,"This is one of the most compelling TV dramas ever made.  But the reason it's not released on home video might go way beyond the ""music rights"" issues previously mentioned.

Five years before COLD CASE even aired, CTV (Canadian TV network) released a series titled COLD SQUAD. And the producers of COLD SQUAD claim that COLD CASE is ""rip off"" of their series. Litigation is still ongoing on this matter. Meredith Stehm, the creator of COLD CASE, was present at a Canadian Film Centre meeting in 2002 where the concept of COLD SQUAD was discussed.  And a year after that, COLD CASE premiered.

CTV's attorneys claim that Stehm used her knowledge of COLD SQUAD to invent a ""copycat"" series. And the lead attorney in CTV's legal team is Pierce O'Donnell ... the attorney who successfully represented Art Buchwald in his copyright infringment suit against Paramount Studios. He's also the attorney who represents the James Bond franchise against any ""copycat"" productions. So, CTV has some serious legal muscle. And the outcome of this litigation is anyone's guess.

FWIW, I was able to find COLD CASE (seasons 1-7) DVDs through another online retailer.  Given what I've just said, and based on the shipping info given by the retailer, I'm relatively certain this set is a pirated Chinese knock-off.  But until the COLD SQUAD vs. COLD CASE litigation concludes, it's probably the only 7-season copy readily available now.  And even when litigation concludes, that doesn't mean a series DVD set will ever be released.  So, if I end up with a pirated product, my conscience is clear.",1404691200,40,1576,4.9393939393939394

Fabulous series but the issue of DVD release is almost definitely due to music copyright issues.  The same problem arose with the fantastic series, THIRD WATCH, where only the first few series were released on DVD - presume that happened before it was realised that the music content copyright was being infringed.

Such a shame that some agreement can't be reached with the copyright holders, as surely it could lead to more sales/downloads of the songs etc that are featured.  Acknowledgement could be added to the credit list at the end of each episode like with films at the cinema (we often stay to watch the credits to ascertain who was the singer of a song we particularly enjoyed in a film).
