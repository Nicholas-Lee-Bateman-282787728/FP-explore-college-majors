2219434,5,B0007LXP2C,"I am the mother of 2 children who play youth  soccer, and they love this DVD.  It's really great because often times I would wish I could play with my kids but I am clueless about soccer skills, and watching this video has allowed me to understand the sport and work with my kids on their skills. It's a wonderful product, and David Beckham is not bad on the eyes either!",1116806400,7,371,4.211267605633803
2219435,5,B0007LXP2C,"I've been a very big fan of David Beckham for a very long time. I don't really play soccer, but this DVD had a lot of extras that I wanted to have on DVD. Well after watching the thing I really got a hinkering to actually play Soccer. I checked with my local parks and rec and found out there was a league for men ages 21-25 that was starting up in just a few weeks. So I said what the heck and joined! I have a feeling I'm really going to be bad, but at least I'll have this DVD as a secret weapon. I'm going to get some of my nephews over to watch it and help me practice. Anyway, I just wanted to point out that you don't need to be a kid or a parent to enjoy this DVD. Fans of David Beckham or any Soccer fan should get it. It has some great extras and it's very entertaining. And hey, it got me off the couch. That's a tough thing to do! :)",1115683200,6,845,3.752808988764045
2219436,5,B0007LXP2C,My kids really like this DVD. They are amazed at how cool the special effects are and for some reason that encourages them to practice more. It's not even soccer season for my 10 year old but he's watching this DVD so much he really wishes it was. He's watched it 4 times just this past weekend. I may have to buy him his own DVD player just to get mine back! haha Honestly though if you have kids who play soccer they will LOVE this DVD. Makes a great gift for parents of of other children who play soccer as well. I bought one for my sisters kids and now I'm their favorite uncle.. well for the time being anyway.,1115078400,9,615,4.090909090909091
2219437,5,B0007LXP2C,"I got this DVD for my fiance's son, and he absolutely loved it. We watched it with him and we were entertained as much as he was. He immediately went outside and started practicing the instant he was done watching it. Almost everyday since he has been watching it and practicing. His skills and his excitement for the game have benefitted greatly from the DVD.

We have bought other instructional videos on Soccer for him and honestly we usually find something else to do while he watches them, which isn't very long usually as he gets bored and his attention goes elsewhere. But with the multiple angles and slow motion and other special effects in this DVD not only is he glued to it, we find ourselves glued to it as well.

If you are a parent of a soccer player, or know a child who plays soccer this is just an awesome gift for them. It will really help their game and keep them, and you entertained. Heck, even if you are just a Soccer fan or a fan of David Beckham, you would get a lot of value out of this DVD. The Soccer Matches that are included on disk two are a blast to watch as well.

Avoid getting the Red Card and buy this dvd now!",1113264000,15,1147,4.204545454545454
2219438,5,B0007LXP2C,"Unlike most soccer skill and highlight programs which tend to be dry and boring, this DVD entertains as well as educates. It is truly unique and a must for anyone who wants to learn or loves soccer.

The DVD is presented on 2 discs and features over 100 minutes of Beckham going over almost every skill imaginable, from beginner skills like passing and shooting to Beckham's bending free kicks. It teaches everyone from young kids to adults how to develop top-level player skills and the bonus disc gives the audience a rare look inside the life of arguably the most famous athlete in the world.

Shot in high-definition using Matrix-like 360-degree multi-camera photography it will definitely entertain its audience, who is treated for the first time to an amazing analysis of Beckham's superior skills, both in real time and super slow motion.

He takes a group of boys and girls of varying age through the extensive soccer drills and answers questions from them on everything from football to life on and off the field with Real Madrid, Victoria (Posh Spice) and his kids.

Disc Two showcases highlights of Beckham career including his unbelievable goal from the half-way line and his last-second free kick goal that helped England qualify for the 2002 World Cup.

A special feature for both youth and adult coaches is a unique printable version of the DVD-ROM coaching plan. The DVD also includes complete Spanish and French versions of the entire program, menus as well.

David mentions in the program that making this DVD was a true labor of love for him and the finished product really reflect that.",1112227200,21,1606,4.886029411764706
2219439,5,B0007LXP2C,"Two weeks ago when a co-worker from England overheard that I was looking for a video to help my son get better at soccer, he asked me if I wanted to teach him to ""bend it like beckham""? I had to admit that I had no idea what he was talking about. Last week he brought a DVD called ""Really Bend It Like Beckham"" to me, and I still only thought he resembled some young actor I had seen on Entertainment Tonight. But this past weekend, my son and i sat down to watch it and were amazed. Sure, it was hard to get him to sit in one place and watch what probably sounded like a boring, one-hour coaching video, but once it began were we both enthralled. This is normally the kind of thing that I might put on, make sure he was watching, and do the crossword, but it was presented in such a fresh and fun way with cool, easy to follow technological effects, that I stuck around to watch the entire thing.  It definitely renewed my son's interest in the sport (after a long spring of practices already) and even made me get excited about helping teach him (which is saying something). If nothing else, ""Really Bend It Like Beckham"" succeeds in entertaining while it teaches, unlike every other coaching video out there.  From here on out, we (and I must admit, my wife too) are big-time Beckham fans.",1111536000,29,1292,4.290983606557377
2219450,4,B0007LXP2C,"Great DVD!  I coach a U10 and U13 team and there is some good stuff on this DVD.  Great video of Beckham, I wish I would have been more into Soccer when he was at his prime!  Great player!",1304121600,,188,3.769230769230769
2219451,5,B0007LXP2C,"I am impressed with the content and production of this dvd. Beckham really works well with the kids. Of course, the kids are already above average in skill. But the material covered in this dvd is very useful in training. I highly recommend it!",1254268800,,244,4.568181818181818
2219452,4,B0007LXP2C,The entertainment factor gets kids watching it - the only coaching or skills DVD they'll watch and then go out and practice the skills on their own. That's a big plus. I've also showed the skills on a TV when we've had to do indoor practice and then have the team repeat the skill. It's worked O.K. It demonstrates a lot of good basic skills any footballer should have but there's a lot more that David could teach and have the kids listen to and learn. (When is part 2 coming out?) I do like where after they demonstrate a skill they show a clip from a professional game of a player using that skill. Other skill DVDs should learn from this. It's also very strong in the way the skill is demonstrated by David and then having a group of kids repeat the skill. Its also fun hearing David's answers to the kids' questions.,1238284800,,821,4.303225806451613
2219453,4,B0007LXP2C,"As a s soccer coach's wife, I get to watch alot of ""how to""  soccer videos.  This one was very interesting to watch.  Then again, it is Beckham we're talking about.",1231459200,,164,4.225806451612903
2219454,5,B0007LXP2C,"We have many soccer training tapes and this one is the best by far. We coach both U12 girls and U17 boys soccer. This has been a great tool to use for the wide range of players that we have. We always can find helpful tips and many, many new drills to do with the kids. The tape has grown with us and our skills. Some are simple enough for the U12 and yet there are many others to challenge the older and more advanced players. We have used the tape many times and have not gotten through DISC1 yet, let alone even touched DISC2. If it's ball skills and control your looking for then this is the tape for you.",1207526400,,609,4.041322314049586
2219455,1,B0007LXP2C,This is probably the worst soccer instructional DVD that I've ever seen (and I've watched quite a few).  More time is spent on David talking about David than on instruction.  Content is light and production is glitzy and distracting.,1151712000,6,233,4.948717948717949
2219456,1,B0007LXP2C,"Beckham is one of the great soccer players of today and I was really looking forward to his hints on how to do things, especially since this is a 2 DVD package.

I was most interested in the ""banana kick"" which is how most people call the kick that bends the ball around say an opposing ""wall.""  Not here.  Almost nothing is here except a lot of special effects, and ""extras"" like some shots of the face of the Great One looking worried as he gets ready to do a penalty kick.  There is a little 20 minutes or so of a game of the Great One vs a bunch of young kids but nothing to learn there.

The only saving grace of this is the points on ""first touch"" which are pretty good.

There are a very few pointers for beginners on how to get past an opponent but nothing any 9 year old can't figure out for him/herself.

So much sizzle, so little steak!",1132963200,9,847,4.066265060240964
2219457,3,B0007LXP2C,This is a skills tape designed primarily for children under the age of 14.  It is advertized as something it is not.  It does not show where he strikes the ball to bend it the way he does.  In fact there is only one short segment on the taking of free kicks and how he does it.  His personality and genuine interest in passing on his knowledge to a new generation is something the DVD accomplishes.,1127347200,6,398,4.197368421052632
2219458,4,B0007LXP2C,This is a very good DVD for entry level players and coaches.  It is simple to follow and has come simple drills...I gave it a 4 because I was hoping for some more advanced features that this is lacking...as a former D1 college player and now coaching I did not take away anything new from the DVD that I did not already know or see.,1124323200,7,332,4.107692307692307
2219459,3,B0007LXP2C,"If you love play soccer it is a great purchase. If you just like to watch is not so good. For me it was very useful. For the first time we can see a good player teaching and coaching his skills. Usually we just see this great players playing at the field. At ""Really Bend It Like Beckham"" we can learn how David Beckham do it. The slow motion at his kicks is great to see exactly how he shot the ball.

I chose three stars because it could be more complete, and could have more moments inside the famous games. Like England X Argentina and the final of Campions League at Man Utd.

But anyway, if you practice soccer it is a good lesson.",1121731200,,637,4.088
8048613,4,B0007LXP2C,I like Beckham.  This Video was a good chance to see his take on strikes.  It isn't the best video but fun to watch and different from others.,1470182400,,142,4.035714285714286
8048614,5,B0007LXP2C,"After borrowing this from our local public library several times, I decided to get a copy to keep. I'm not thrilled with all the bumper music in between the segments, it can make it a bit tedious when watching straight through. However, I think the content is pretty good for beginning/intermediate players. The thing I liked most is how Beckham shows a particular move, then they show it in an actual game. As a casual watcher and a daughter who is still new to the game, it helps when you can see the movement done in context.

Unfortunately, the copy I purchased from the marketplace is not the greatest despite being listed in ""Very Good Condition"". In actuality, the 1st DVD is pretty heavily scratched and skips. That should teach me to take these marketplace descriptions with a grain of salt. On the plus side, I think I basically got the DVD for less than a dollar, but paid for the shipping. I can still watch 98% of the content.",1446508800,,939,4.523529411764706
8048615,5,B0007LXP2C,Great DVD for beginners.,1444089600,,24,5.25
8048616,5,B0007LXP2C,Interesting dvd.  My 11 year old granddaughter loves it,1423872000,,55,5.111111111111111
8048617,2,B0007LXP2C,"Disc was loose in box, haven't played it to see if it is scratched.
Questioned if I could exchange it and answer was no.",1417132800,,120,4.041666666666667
8048618,3,B0007LXP2C,"The video provided insight into basis soccer skills, but would have liked more soccer footage of David Beckham utilizing more advance skills.",1413331200,,141,5.454545454545454
8048619,3,B0007LXP2C,"This dvd is primarily aim at preteens, of course anyone can get something out of it, but it is defiantly for the younger players.",1411603200,,129,4.416666666666667
8048620,4,B0007LXP2C,like Beckham but after watching the video you can't help but like the guy.  Lots of great training tip of younger kids and Beckham also gives his personal feeling about them too.,1373932800,,178,4.5625
8048621,4,B0007LXP2C,"Tis dvd was really interesting about David's teaching but my son (10) would have liked more info.  My son really like the DVD and we especially enjoyed the slow motion shots to see David's form/style.  That said, he is still glad to be able to learn from his hero.",1365033600,,264,4.36734693877551
8048622,3,B0007LXP2C,"It isn't bad just not what I expected.  It is informative and helpful at a basic level, lacking advance technical information.  Depending on what age you are coaching (U8,U11,etc) and where there skill level is currently comes into play if you should add this to your video library.",1360713600,,282,4.854166666666667
