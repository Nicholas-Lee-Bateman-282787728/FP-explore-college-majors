However - it's underdeveloped - the picture is only ok most of the time - sometimes the picture Is just bad and blurry. There are parts that are fairly good and parts that needed someone in terms of continuity - toward the end there were scenes indicating it the middle of the night and others indicating it's morning going back and forth.  I assume they either didn't care, didn't notice or didn't have the money to fix.

The 'blonde bombshell' was Barbara Valentin (born Ursula Ledersteger; 15 December 1940  22 February 2002) who was an Austrian actress. Valentin was called ""the German Jayne Mansfield"" during her acting career as she was very busty. She was the only semi-famous person involved with this German movie.

I found the basic plot interesting but completely mishandled in terms of writing and directing.

I would rate this thusly - picture 4.5 to 5.0 out of 10 - overall movie a 5.5 to 6.0 out of 10 - I watched it via Amazon Prime over 3 nights as it's only 75 minutes long - worth checking out as it's kind of cheesy attempt at horror which I love.",1475539200,,1149,4.5

Since I am a huge B monster movie fan I think I can say without question that this was one of the WORST movies in this genre that I have ever seen!  But that fact also made it hysterical to watch too which means it could have gotten 5 stars for the worst.  And by the way, the picture on the cover does not in any way describe the period of time in which this movie takes place which I believe is the 50's.  I am not sorry I bought it however because now it takes the place of Reptilicus as the worst movie in my collection.",1470009600,,635,3.853846153846154
8757641,2,B01E4ZMX3I,"Terrible movie.  Looks like it was made with a home super 8 camera.  The acting is amateur, the spider props are hilarious.  Something my granddaughter would love. .",1469145600,,165,4.821428571428571
