2067507,5,B00028G51I,My daughter is 2 years old and loves them. Great DVD ! It keeps her busy for a while and I get to do what I need.,1114041600,4,113,3.2222222222222223
2067508,5,B00028G51I,"This dvd is great fun for my 2 year old twins.  They absolutely LOVE the little stories that are in the middle of each episode.  They like to imitate boohbah as they do their ""exercises"".  They also name off the colors of each boohbah as they appear. As far as adults watching it, I wouldn't say they are 'nails down a chalkboard' but it is definitly geared towards children only.",1107129600,7,380,4.4
2067509,5,B00028G51I,"My son is 5 months old, way below the age range.  He absolutely adores the Boohbahs!  He gets excited when they come on and do their dance.  This video keeps him occupied so I can do all the daily chores needed.  He also has a cpouple of the Boohbah characters and squeals everytime he plays with them.  This is definitely a great video for the younger children.  I will definitely buy him more!",1097539200,12,395,4.342465753424658
2067561,5,B00028G51I,"I especially love that the dvd is so long (about an hour) and they cut out the look at what i can do part.  My daughter loves to dance with the ""e.t.s"" as she calls them and the dvd arrived well before Easter (it was part of her gift) and was in excellent condition.",1179014400,,266,3.925925925925926
2067562,1,B00028G51I,"I guarantee that somewhere in the smoky, brimestone-reeking pits of hell, there is a 100-foot screen endlessly showing this brain remover to screaming sinners, tied down with their eyelids glued open.

Don't condescend to your kids by showing them this; get them something like Blue's Clues that actually makes them use their heads for something besides a hair platform.",1140652800,4,370,5.271186440677966
2067563,5,B00028G51I,"BooooohBaaaah! phbbbbbbth!  weeeee!

I re-named all five of my children after the Boohbahs

THere is bobby ""zingzingzingBAH!""

and little anne ""humBAH"" just to name a few....

They have gained important life skills like the ability to sing their names, jump up and down, and for some reason, developed an adversion to ""comfy"" chairs of any sort.

How strange.

However, my childrens' ECSTATIC state has left me friends with all members of the large BoohBah family.

I strongly recommend the purchase of this product as well as the avid participation in all of their excercises.",1137110400,3,577,5.0638297872340425
2067564,4,B00028G51I,My son was so interested with the sounds and Boohbahs dancing when he was 15 months and he was dancing and jumping wiith them. Now he is 27 months and he is more interested with the story people. But he still likes the show anyway. At least he is busy and happy with it for few time! However the DVD has three segments. One of them is the Squeaky Socks. Each segment starts with Boohbahs show and then the story and at the end Boohbahs will dance and jump again.,1133740800,5,462,4.144444444444445
2067565,5,B00028G51I,"I read a few reviews from adults, knocking the Boohbahs. Get a clue already. It's for little kids, not you. My 15 month old daughter loves the boohbahs, and I kinda like them myself. It's fun, and there's nothing at all harmful about them.

Boooooooooooooohbaaaaaaaaaaah!",1130630400,7,271,5.022222222222222
2067566,5,B00028G51I,Ok look people we are not talking about a oscar winning movie here.  This is a show for little children and my daughter loves the boohbahs.  It isn't intended for adults!!!  If it gives my daughter enjoyment it makes me happy  Thanks!!,1129334400,4,235,4.523809523809524
2067567,4,B00028G51I,"Instead of a snarky ""critique"" of ""Boohbah,"" here's a review of this DVD (and of ""Boohbah"" DVDs in general)

If you're unfamiliar with ""Boohbah,"" the concept is that Boohbahs are five little alien-like furry creatures that dance and bop to electronic-style music. The educational value of Boohbah lies in getting pre-schoolers interested in movement, pattern and color. The Boohbahs do not speak (as opposed to the similar Teletubbies, created by the same company: Ragdoll).

Another portion of the show is about ""The Story People."" Children present a gift-wrapped box in the Boohbah pod, blow the gift upward and send it to the Story People (Grandmama, Grandpapa, Mr Man, Mrs Lady, Brother & Sister, Auntie and Little Dog Fido). At least one of the Story People receives the gift and has a cute, wordless* adventure about the gift. The Boohbah videos/DVDs are named after the gifts given to The Story People (""squeaky socks"" for example). Another gift magically appears during the course of the Story People episode, to extend the adventure. *There is audio of children yelling ""Boohbah!"" and similar when the second gift appears.

During the show, there is a third portion which is about children dancing and moving to music like the Boohbahs do. This is part of the ""extra features"" on Boohbah DVDs.

This DVD features three 20-minutes segments of Boohbah:

Squeaky Socks: Brother & Sister play in some oversized socks that squeak when one bounces in them

Painting the Fence: Auntie finds a bucket of paint and paints a seemingly never-ending fence

Hammock: Grandpapa has trouble getting into a hammock

The Boohbahs dance and play at the beginning and end of every segment, making color patterns and encouraging children to be active viewers. It's difficult for little ones to vegetate while watching ""Boohbah.""

Your menu options include ""play all,"" which gives you all three 20-minute segments back-to-back, and ""select episode,"" which runs for that 20-minute period before returning to the menu.

If you have questions/concerns about the educational content of Boohbah, there is a ""for parents"" feature on every DVD which explains the learning concepts behind ""Boohbah.""",1128902400,16,2179,5.2
8023682,1,B00028G51I,"I'm giving 1 star because for buying ""used"" I expect a little bit of wear and tear on the DVD and the case but this is jus pathetic. At least the DVD works fine so in the end that's all that matters. :)",1489017600,,202,3.7209302325581395
8023683,5,B00028G51I,"We bought this to replace one (purchased at a garage sale) that my children love. Yes, they are a bit creepy but it is fun for the kids. It is less annoying than Dora",1471996800,,166,3.911764705882353

8023686,5,B00028G51I,I really like Boobah quality product,1412121600,,36,5.166666666666667
8023687,5,B00028G51I,Some of these shows are bad and for little ones  i am to old for boobah and teletubbies and barney.,1398556800,,99,3.95
8023688,3,B00028G51I,Ordered this for my granddaughter. She is just a year old and won't get to watch the Boohbahs since they are no longer on tv. I also got her the dancing toy. I love them.,1370649600,,170,3.8857142857142857

8023690,5,B00028G51I,"My son loves Baby Booh Bah & also anything that makes squeaky sounds. If your child likes lots of colors,silly noises & sound effects,this DVD is for you :-)",1338508800,,157,4.448275862068965
8023691,3,B00028G51I,"This show is designed to keep kids preoccupied while mom or dad file taxes or while the babysitter calls her friend on the phone. Boobah is entertainment for babies not educational at all.  This show is nothing like sesame street(old school sesame street to be exact).
I thought the purpose of educational television was to prepare children for school. At least that is what sesame street's original stated purpose was to prepare children for school.
This show is entertainment under the guise of so called Educational Television.",1244246400,,530,5.091954022988506
