8400124,3,B003M6FEBY,"Earlier versions of this ""Making of"" were much better.  There was more of the players' personalities on display in earlier years.  These seem to have become more a record of what poses were used and what poses were discarded when releasing the calendar.",1323820800,,253,4.8604651162790695
8400125,2,B003M6FEBY,"After not liking last year's edition, I said I would not buy another edition even though I own every year. I decided to buy this 2010 DVD thinking that maybe they would go  all out with the 10th edition including full frontal nudity. How wrong I was!! Again there is no frontal nudity except for one quick shot. What this edition is really about is watching these masculine men being asked to jump in the air or skip, agree to have buckets of water thrown all over them and in their faces, while in the background the same electro music from past editions is playing. In watching this DVD something seemed distant with the images and then I realized this has all been shot on film as a movie instead of using video as in the past editions which made it all look live. My biggest complaint is throughout the entire film in the lower right hand side of the screen it says: [...] Are they afraid someone is going to copy the images? Also, I guess to be politically correct one of the models is a young black man with dread locks who is fat and has an undefined body. For me this series has become boring and hard to watch...it is two hours long but I could only watch about 45 minutes the first night as it was really getting annoying. What market are they trying to tap with these DVD's? This is definitely the last one I will buy...I have no desire to even look at this edition again...a total waste of money.",1277078400,25,1408,4.293233082706767
