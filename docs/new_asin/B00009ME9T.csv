7991745,5,B00009ME9T,"The things this guy gets up to...and in to..!!  His antics make me a nervous wreck worrying what will happen if he gets caught, which somehow he never really does.  This series is clever, inventive, hilarious and charming...but in no say relaxing!  Enjoy !",1394668800,,256,4.7727272727272725
7991746,5,B00009ME9T,"Charming rascal Howard Booth is a ex-con fresh out of the clink. He is a good for nothing, lying swindler who crashes with his sweet younger sister, Mary. Trevor, Mary's husband, is the source of the biggest laughs on this lovely little comedy.",1392422400,,244,4.6976744186046515
7991747,4,B00009ME9T,"I love English Sit-Coms as a genre, and this is among my favorites. Peter Boles is wonderful, as always, and the plot is light, witty and entertaining.",1391731200,2,151,4.62962962962963
7991748,4,B00009ME9T,"Howard (Peter Bowles) is a creative, comedic con man who keeps failing to fulfill his varied schemes to get rich.  Every episode is funny and full of adventures that would make the complete series worth watching more than once.  But this 2-disc ""set"" does not include the beginning episodes of Series 1, and therefore we have no idea how he really came to live and remain with his sister Mary (Rosalind Ayres) and brother-in-law, Trevor (George Cole) -- and why his sister is not in any of these episodes. (There is no clue as to why this is not the complete series on the cover.)  The first episode sets us up with Howard already installed in the house with his usually too-timid-to-be-aggressive brother-in-law and involved with Laura, ""the rich lady next door"" (Isla Blair).  We do understand that Howard was in prison for fraud for two years because his ""investment firm"" was a con.  These clues are referenced occasionally by both men.  We also learn that Mary has left Trevor, but why?  It is frustrating not to know exactly what happened. The title of ""Tale of the Unexpected"" is not just the title of one episode; there are several funny episodes in this Series 2.

I saw the complete original series a few years ago. I know that the beginning episodes are really necessary to understand why Trevor is so frustrated and why Howard is in such a hurry to marry the woman whose money he stole. But unless one gets the whole picture, it might be difficult to understand the machinations that keep Howard in trouble with past acquaintances and the law.  This should have been noted as Series 2.  Since it isn't, the viewer either has to enjoy the second season or pay much more for what is labelled The Complete Set.

I can't give it a full 5 stars since we are not given what we expect.  But it is an excellent series.  Try to find the Complete version, which I thought this was.  I really wouldn't have paid $25 for just a few episodes...and without any ending!  The series was cancelled just as it seemed to be heading for some more adventures.

I would have given this the 5-star review if it hadn't left me unsatisfied with the entire storyline. Being left with questions and often confused is not worthy of what 5 Stars means.  Wait until you want to pay over $100 for The Complete Bounder.",1341446400,2,2299,4.554744525547445
7991749,4,B00009ME9T,"Years ago UK Television station ITV used to screen numerous comedies. You would never have thought it judging by the stuff they screen today.
Back in 1982-83 ITV contractor Yorkshire Television made 14 episodes of The Bounder, a sitcom for all the family. Starring Peter Bowles as Howard, a fraudster just released from prison, and George Cole as his brother in law. Howard goes to live with his sister Mary upon release from jail and ends up in all sorts of comical capers. Bowles and Cole certainly add gravitas to the programme.
This is worth a watch as it has never been repeated as far as I am aware and I never saw it during the original run.
For around six hours of gentle old fashioned comedy, this is a boxset worth watching.
Enjoy!",1332806400,,741,4.537313432835821
7991750,5,B00009ME9T,"We love the Bounder series, the funniest Brit comedy ever. We have watched them over and over and never tire of Howard's ventures and Trevor's reactions. There are two volumes to the series. Really funny!",1233014400,2,204,4.857142857142857
7991751,5,B00009ME9T,This series spotlights Peter Bowles' ability to play a smooth operator albeit one with few scruples!  He is charming and scheming at the same time and the supporting cast is also stellar.  The writing is crisp and highlights the actors' abilities.  Good Job!,1126224000,3,258,4.953488372093023
7991752,4,B00009ME9T,"The Bounder is a cute early eighties' britcom starring Peter Bowles (To the Manor Born, Rumpole of the Bailey, The Irish RM) which was, in fact, written for him by series' writer Eric Chappell, with whom Bowles had worked previously on Only When I Laugh.  If you're familiar with any of Chappell's other offerings, like Rising Damp or Home to Roost, for example, you will be familiar with his style of writing, and if you've enjoyed either of these two series, you will almost certainly enjoy this one.  Fourteen episodes were made, of which the first seven (with a duration of just under 25 minutes each) appear in this boxed set.
Bowles plays Howard Booth, a convicted embezzler just released from prison.  Howard, a posh, luxury-loving, smooth-talking layabout, immediately turns up on the doorstep of his sister Mary and her serious-minded, law-abiding husband Trevor (George Cole) and ends up moving in--temporarily (ahem) of course!  Howard immediately takes a shine to Laura, the attractive widow next door--a shine which turns to a positive gleam when he finds out she also happens to be wealthy.  Of course Howard cannot tell her of his rather embarrassing past (particularly as she was herself a victim of his embezzlement scheme!), so he simply contrives a story--something which seems to be a bit of a habit with him!
The episodes consist of Howard getting himself entangled in one lie or scheme after another, be it in an attempt to raise money (illegally, of course), to redeem himself in Laura's eyes (unsuccessfully, of course), to save face, and so on.  Howard has a fairly easy time ingratiating himself with Mary, but Trevor is nobody's fool.  So it's rather comical whenever Trevor ends up in humiliating situations thanks to Howard.  All of Howard's schemes end up comically backfiring on him, but none does so more perfectly than when he has Trevor hire a private detective to dig up dirt on Laura's new love interest in the last episode.  I wish I could say more, but I don't want to give anything away--suffice it to say that I look forward indeed to the release of the rest of the series!
If you're a fan of Britcoms in general and particularly if you've enjoyed Peter Bowles in some of his better-known roles, I think you'll enjoy this one.  All in all it's a cute, entertaining, and very enjoyable little series which features a strong cast.  Certainly, it's one which I enjoyed and look forward to watching again.",1071964800,21,2441,4.829736211031175
7991753,5,B00009ME9T,"The Bounder is tightly written and perfectly cast. A comedy of character and situation, it's hilarious -- far better than any other British SitCom. My wife and I have almost worn out an old VHS off-the-air recording of it. This 2-disc set appears to have all seven episodes from the first season. Hopefully the second season will be issued soon. Some may find it over the top, but I think the writer, director and cast created a television classic.",1062979200,8,448,4.6835443037974684
