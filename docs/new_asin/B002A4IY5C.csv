8358868,1,B002A4IY5C,"After suffering through a tumultuous few shows due to injuries and other unfortunate happenstances, TNA tried to get back kn track with one of their premiere shows, but, instead, ""Against All Odds"" ended up being one of their worst shows ever. Most of the matches are simply mediocre, and that includes the bland main event featuring Team 3D, Sting and Kurt Angle killing time to set up the match everyone realky wanted, which we'd get at ""Destination X"" next month.

True, there are a few decent matches in the X Division Title match between Alex Shelley and Eric Young as well as the Tag Team Titles match between Beer Money and Lethal Consequences; however, neither of these matches are anything close to saving a show this bad.

Elsewhere, Abyss gets his obligatory hardcore match, the Knockouts phone it in and there's even a squash match!

To be fair, TNA was still dealing with a jumble of injuries to top stars during this time, but that's no excuse for this torpid, nonsensical piece of flotsam. I can't think of a worse wrestling show off the top of my head... and that includes those really awful WCW 2000 events.",1411171200,,1124,4.695431472081219
8358869,4,B002A4IY5C,"If you want pretty lights and big self-promotion then you will watch the New York ""entertainment"" with its constant repeat stale matches and over-hyped, over priced pay per views. I am been a wrestling fan for over 30 years and TNA is wrestling!!I have seen moves and matches in TNA that have ""wowed"" me and never expect to see from New York.",1345593600,,342,4.532258064516129
8358870,1,B002A4IY5C,UHHH TNA is Just a clone of WCW in 2000 and 2001 you can say this is a 3hr snooze fest right here ...,1343952000,,101,3.25
8358871,5,B002A4IY5C,Enjoyed this documentary greatly. Lots of original footage.  A little more back historical background of Malta would have been helpful.,1311120000,,135,5.75
8358872,3,B002A4IY5C,all i can say iss that it was a mid level show with a couple good matches if you can get this used cheaply i say buy it you'll be entertained enough to justify it,1272672000,,162,3.657142857142857
8358873,1,B002A4IY5C,"This is another review where I'm not going to waste my time doing a match by match review because this event was just so bad. This was obiviously one of those filler events that TNA put little to no effort into which is sad concidering how usually Against All Odds is one of their most solid shows. The Main Event Mafia vs. Frontline storyline had really fallen apart at this time & don't let the DVD cover fool you as Rhino's role in the group had ran it's course & he's not on here while Samoa Joe & A.J. Styles (Jarrett too) were out with injuries...making this the first monthly PPV that A.J. Styles didn't wrestle on since the company started doing them.

With them out, the main event was a four way match between Sting & Kurt Angle vs. Team 3D for the World Title which would have been good for an Impact main event but was only ""OK"" for a PPV main event...at least it was better than the Rhino match we got a month earlier but this was only here to continue the internal problems between Sting & Kurt leading into the next PPV as Kurt wanted the World Championship. Aside from two title matches being average (Shelley/Young for the X Title & Beer Money/Lethal Consequences for the Tag Titles), the rest of the card was disappointing (O.D.B./Kong & Williams/Steiner not coming close to how they did the previous year) to poor (Booker/Sewell, Sabin jobbing out & carrying Brutus Magnus in a last min. filler, Morgan having to work around his injury in his match with Abyss).

Nothing special happened here & this event was easily forgotten about once it's was over so the only way I would recommend this is it it was packaged with in another ""Cross The Line"" set but since it's not, this is one show you can & should easily skip.",1245024000,2,1735,4.435736677115988
