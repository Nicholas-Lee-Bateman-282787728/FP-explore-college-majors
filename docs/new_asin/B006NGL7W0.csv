8501401,1,B006NGL7W0,"Lord Hamilton (Menyhrt Ren Balog-Dutomb) is kidnapped by pirates and England won't pay the 10,000 gold piece ransom. Lady Hamilton (Anita Rinaldi) decides to rescue him with the aides of a gallery of rogues, including an oriental fighter named Kato.

The film promises to be an action packed sexy romp,and is anything but. The sword play was really bad. It looked like these guys were unsure which end to hold the sword. It also promises a ""cat fight"" which wasn't the knocked down drag out rip your clothes off kind, but one that lasts about 30 seconds.

The film does have f-bombs, sex and nudity but far from the norm for a  Joe D'Amato film.  No extras on the DVD and not a great transfer to DVD.
