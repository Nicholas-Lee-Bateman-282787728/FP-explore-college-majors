All Day has partner with VCI Home Entertainment for releasing this project.
Kidos to All Day& VCI for seeing the value in this project!

From All Day's Press release:

Let it be known: BECOMING CHARLEY CHASE, a four-disc box set collecting the early works of America's most influential comic genius, is ON ITS WAY! Thank your patience and perseverence. Charley Chae fans have had their hearts broken before (Milestone, I'm lookin' at you) and I did not want to be part of the problem.
This summer, VCI Entertainment will be distributing this deluxe box set, with the same specs and price point as originally advertised.

Please note that any pre-orders you may have already placed will not be valid--because of the change of distributor, the set will have a new UPC symbol and will be treated by retailers as a new release, so you will need to re-order all over again.

VCI has shown extraordinary support and enthusiasm for silent comedy at a time when the marketplace is not entirely welcoming. If you are not already familiar with them, please seek out their superb WEISS-O-RAMA collection--and if you already own that treasure, do check out VCI's catalog for other great finds, and show them your support in return. This is a small community--we're in this together--and thanks to their faith, Charley Chase will get his due after all. I am thrilled--and when you see what we've done here, I think you will be too.",1243209600,,1646,5.311538461538461

We had 5 plus 6 from KINO, and 12 from LOBSTER, in France, which originated the copies, more or less the same titles, plus some odd ones from IMAGE.
Things seem to be shaping up and all CHASE fans will be shouting for more. That edition will do nicely to make our mouths water.",1228262400,10,332,4.123076923076923
