3916891,5,B002EEAJXI,"Very entertaining look at birders who are really committed to their craft. I enjoyed the close-up look at what it takes to bird for 24 hours, and the skills & preparation required to make the final tally a competitive one in the World Series of Birding. The many touches of humor keep it fun, while important messages about conservation are not neglected. As a birder I loved it, but have watched it with non-birders who were just as entertained.",1386892800,,446,4.658227848101266
3916892,5,B002EEAJXI,"Never having been a participant in the World Series of Birding I found Opposable Chums, Guts and Glory both informative and fun!",1375401600,,128,4.863636363636363
3916893,4,B002EEAJXI,"This DVD does a good job explaining the World Series of Birding (WSB).  It will introduce you to who started the WSB, some of the contestants, the rules, how WSB works and  the function & purpose of the WSB.  If you are interested in some of the big names in birding, this DVD has that, too.  The DVD is geared for people interested (very interested) in birding.  Not recommended as an introduction to birding.

The interviews with the contestants was touching and displayed other aspects than just the competition.  Examples are the ""Balding Eagles"" (which are old men), the ""Sand Miners,"" the ""Big Sit"" group, the ""Runners/Joggers,"" the ""Sapsuckers,"" the ""Goshawks,"" etc.  The interviews will help you realize the groups may have other goals, besides winning.

The DVD presents the contest and gives you a flavor of the competition.  For an avid birder, it is exciting.  For a novice, the DVD maybe a little slow.  Contrary to another reviewer, I had no trouble following and understanding the movie.  It is well laid out and structured.

I watched it three times.  And, will watch it again.",1367884800,4,1093,4.832432432432433
3916894,5,B002EEAJXI,"I invited a flock of birders to my home to watch this documentary and they loved it. It is certainly for birders, but even the non-birding spouses enjoyed it. We also thoroughly enjoyed watching the extras. Everyone wanted to know when I would host the next 'bird nerd' film festival so I am searching for something similar, or, I believe, I could just show this one again and everyone would show up and enjoy it just as much the second time.",1342310400,3,442,4.469135802469136
3916895,3,B002EEAJXI,"For a birder this was O.K but I was hoping for more field stuff and less personal interviews.  The video assumes one knows alot about the event so for new birders you need to explain a lot of stuff before showing the movie, for example at a birding club meeting.",1292630400,,262,4.24
3916896,5,B002EEAJXI,I saw this video a year ago and remember laughing a lot. We birders are a different breed and to see a movie about the biggest birding competition that is held every year was enjoyable.,1291593600,3,185,4.314285714285714

8367641,4,B002EEAJXI,"Fun birding documentary. A little slow at times, but overall and enjoyable watch! I think most birders will enjoy it.",1466899200,,117,4.9
8367642,5,B002EEAJXI,"Opposable Chums is really excellent, and I'm not even a bird watcher!

The film isn't really about birds, it's about bird watchers, and this crazy contest thing they do once a year.  They compete to see which team can spot the most birds, and the whole thing is a fundraiser for conservation.  And these bird watchers are a hoot (pun intended), smart and funny people with a ridiculously high level of expertise.

This film was a lot of fun.  And funny! Love this filmmaker and his point of view on the contest and his fellow birders. Made me want to learn more about birds and bird-watching as well, even though like I said, it's not really a film about birds.  Five stars! For sure!",1446249600,2,684,4.475806451612903

8367644,5,B002EEAJXI,"A fun behind the scenes look at one crazy, weird, and misunderstood hobby.  Great for the birder, the documentarist, or anyone looking for a different kind of film.",1440892800,,164,4.857142857142857
8367645,5,B002EEAJXI,"Jason Kesslers film is an intriguing incite into The World Series of Birding ,a 24 hour contest where Birdwatchers of various knowledge and abilities compete to see as many different types of birds in the set time period. The event is sponsored so money is raised for charities and the film shows the preperations the various teams go thru and the highs and lows they face thruout the 24 hours, as a birdwatcher myself i found it all very enjoyable, as i think it would someone just ""dipping"" into the hobby.",1440547200,,508,4.593406593406593
8367646,3,B002EEAJXI,"Being a birder, I always look for something on the subject as it is pretty rare.  This was okay, but not outstanding.",1398470400,2,117,4.318181818181818
8367647,4,B002EEAJXI,"I didn't have super high expectations of the quality of this documentary, mostly because I thought it looked just a few steps up from a home movie. I was pleasantly surprised at just how much I enjoyed it, primarily because of the fun people it's about.",1393027200,,253,4.521739130434782
