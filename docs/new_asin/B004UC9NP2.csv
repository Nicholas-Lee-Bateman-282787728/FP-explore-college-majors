4466849,4,B004UC9NP2,"For anyone who's been to a Distant Worlds concert before, for anyone who tracks their website, waiting for the next concert in their area to be announced, this DVD is a must buy, and you will for the most part be happy with your purchase.  This concert DVD faithfully recreates the experience of attending Distant Worlds.  Let me be clear, this is a good DVD to own... but as a fan I mainly see only how it could be even better.

The problem is that it just happens to be a less impressive concert than the ones I remember attending in person: many important songs are included, but it feels as though just as many are left out.  I think most fans will agree from a glance at the program that XIII and XIV are given far too many songs (9 between the two games, all in a row) while other titles go ignored.  Thankfully, not all of the songs from the new games are duds: (in my opinion) Blinded by Light and Blade's Edge both sound fantastic performed by a full orchestra, and Navigator's Glory blew me away, even though I've never played XIV.  They are great additions to be sure, but what are those other 6 songs doing here?  For that matter, why was XII snubbed?  Honestly, the only reason I can think of for why they have such a dominating presence is for the scandalous reason to shamelessly promote for these games, which reviewed much lower than expected.  What's more, these songs, being from a more advanced consoles, aren't as impressive to hear in concert compared with the many deserving songs from the SNES, NES, and PS1 days that have yet to appear in Distant Worlds.

The new songs included outside of XIII and XIV are solid efforts for the most part.  Clash on the Big Bridge is stirring song, but (in my opinion) failed to live up the energy of the original.  And the new Chocobo medley sounded really good, until I realized it was a medley of two: a remix of the chocobo theme, followed by Brass/Swing de Chcocobo from X, which has appeared as it's own song in Distant Worlds concerts before: it doesn't really feel so much like a brand new song, as a reworked piece from other concerts.  Personally, Ukulele de Chocobo (from IX) and Cinco de Chocobo (from VII) both would have been great mixes to be included.  The Medley of Final Fantasy I-III has also been reworked, and though the differences are relatively minor, it sounds better for it.

Undoubtedly, you'll watch the Returning Home, and you'll notice all the songs you love that made it in, as well as the songs you love that didn't.  Personally, I don't see how they can have a concert without Liberi Fatali from VIII, and I missed not having the Theme of Love from IV.  I also wish that Returning Home had been a little more Japanese: seeing Suteki Da Ne performed in the original Japanese on Distant Worlds would have been amazing, but it was rejected, perhaps because they had planned to release the DVD worldwide.  Still, given that it was the Japanese version that the entire world originally fell in love with, it feels like a lost opportunity.

This review is filled with my personal preferences, and undoubtedly after watching it, you'll have formed your own.  However, with the right home theater set-up you will feel like you've just been to a Distant Worlds concert after watching it, and that makes it worth the money, and a great value.  The picture and sound are great, and the included cds containing the concert are a nice bonus, though many songs have already been released in the previous two Distant Worlds albums in better quality.",1302307200,2,3526,4.5474683544303796
4466850,5,B004UC9NP2,"To clear the confusion, this set contains songs from the Distant Worlds I album within one of it's 3 disks - One DVD and 2 audio CD's. What sets the difference between this version of the music and the album version is that NONE of these songs are digitally remastered - what you hear here is what you hear from a live recording without the computer re-mastering the tracks themselves. Granted, the album itself sounds much better (for those audiophiles)but this set is definitely for those who has attended the Distant Worlds Concerts or those who wished to attend but couldn't. Now, this set contains 1 DVD for the concert itself and 1 disk for Distant Worlds I. What's the last CD? It includes some songs (but not all)from the Distant Worlds II album. Again, these are not-modified in any way from their recording (or at least that's what the representative told me), but what shocks me more were that there are some pre-release soundtracks for FFXIV (Final Fantasy 14) and some from FFXIII (Final Fantasy 13). Because the Final Fantasy XIV OST is not yet released at the time of this review, this is a MUST HAVE for those hardcore fans (especially the Nobuo Uematsu ones).
Included is also an art book of high quality of the concert Distant Worlds:Returning Home from the concert in Japan. There is also a bonus track in the DVD about the background productions of Distant worlds in Japan itself during its Returning Home Concert.

EDIT: As a fellow member has pointed out, I will clarify that this DOES NOT contain all songs from the Distant Worlds I and II disks, but only some. The ones left out are as follows:

""DW1:
Liberi Fatali (FFVIII)
Fisherman's Horizon (FFVIII)
Memoro de la Stono~Distant Worlds (FFXI)
Theme of Love (FFIV)
Opera Maria and Draco (FFVI)
DW2:
Prelude (FF Series)
A Place to Call Home - Melodies of Life (FFIX)
Suteki Da Ne (FFX)
Main Theme of Final Fantasy VII (FFVII)
Prima Vista Orchestra (FFIX) ""

Lacking of these songs are disappointing but understandable, since 1) It's not possible to cram two disks worth of HQ music into one without sacrificing quality and 2) They want you to buy the other two soundtracks separately to promote their sales. However, even though the names of the songs repeat, THEY ARE STILL DIFFERENT (DW I&II vs Returning Home) because the former is a studio recording while this is a LIVE recording - if you listen carefully, you can notice some difference in the songs. Despite this, I still recommend this collection to any FF fan.",1301702400,33,2493,4.713302752293578
4466851,5,B004UC9NP2,"I first saw the Distant Worlds concert in December of 2009 at Chicago. Probably the most memorable experience of my life thus far. I was grateful that even a portion of this experience could be placed on dvd. It allowed me to share it with friends and family to let them know what I had experienced.

My only qualm was that there was only one Susan Calloway song out and it wasn't my favorite. I would have truly loved to hear Melodies of Life again.",1308096000,2,450,4.294117647058823
4466852,5,B004UC9NP2,"I have to say, that even though I received my DVD after the delivery date, I'm still satisfied with my order overall because this DVD is worth paying for, no matter how much it costs. And the 2 audio CD's that comes with it are just a bonus to this awesome box set! The concert in Tokyo, Japan, is so hypnotizing and addicting that, you'll actually feel like your there! I literally felt like my TV just pulled me in through the screen just because of how great the concert was! The package itself has it's own little unique scent to it (not kidding about that one). This DVD is worth every single penny, even if they published the DVD without the 2 audio CD's. And just from watching the concert, it gives you an idea of how the concerts are if you've never been to a concert before, or if you've never been to a Distant Worlds concert! I would recommend that every Distant Worlds fan should buy this box set, all other Distant Worlds CD's published so far, and all future Distant Worlds CD's too. They're worth every single penny! : )",1307232000,2,1036,4.345360824742268
4466853,5,B004UC9NP2,"I haven't watched the included DVD yet. However, the two music CDs only are good enough to let me give this title 5 stars. Many legendary songs from FF I to IX are included. Sound quality is good, too.",1306281600,,201,4.17948717948718
4466854,5,B004UC9NP2,"Brief summary:

Fantastic Design, great music collection. High quality DVD and impressive artwork and photos in the booklet.

Good value for money.",1305763200,,147,5.636363636363637
4466855,5,B004UC9NP2,"Great music for all Final Fantasy fan.
There are new songs from FFXIV that I haven't heard before, and they are good!
I wish there were music from Final Fantasy IV though.
If you are a FF fan, you should definitely get it!",1305676800,,222,4.186046511627907
4466856,4,B004UC9NP2,I had so much fun listening this DVD but i'm a little bit disappoint of the pocket. The pocket arrive to me a little flattens.,1305417600,,126,4.08
4466857,5,B004UC9NP2,"I have been luck to witness Distant Worlds live once myself and I can say from experience that this DVD is as close as you can get without actually going to one of the shows. If you love Final Fantasy like I do and love the music, this DVD is for you, but I highly suggest seeing one of these shows in person someday if possible.",1305072000,,329,4.0
4466858,5,B004UC9NP2,"This is awesome performance for Final Fantasy Orchestra Concert. The DVD is collectible since last 2006 Final Fantasy DVD Concert - VOICES. For those who not able on the live stage, you may buy this DVD to feel the environment of the greatest performance ever before.",1304985600,2,267,4.826086956521739
4466859,5,B004UC9NP2,"A recording of the 2010 Tokyo Distant Worlds concert, this DVD/CD collection is an excellent addition to ones collection, even if you already own both Distant Worlds CDs thus far.
The DVD has the complete concert, and the 2 CDs contain all the tracks as well. This concert has new additions to the track line up, including 9 new songs from Final Fantasy XIII and XIV, a new encore track from Final Fantasy VI, and the 2010 versions of the Chocobo Medley and Final Fantasy I-III Medley.
If you've never been to one of the concerts this is a must have, and if you have it certainly is a good memento (albeit with new content).

Highly recommended.",1304640000,,645,4.512820512820513
4466860,5,B004UC9NP2,"For Distant Worlds and Final Fantasy music fans, this is a cannot miss item to get. If you not yet experience the Distant Worlds this is the one. But I can tell you if there is a chance, don't miss their live performance. Is Awesome.",1304380800,4,233,4.2
8441425,5,B004UC9NP2,"I live in Chicago and therefore was extremely fortunate to attend the only Final Fantasy - Distant Worlds ""The Celebration"" Concert in the United States, which took place in December 2012.  Before the main concert, I stood right in front of one of my idols, Mr. Uematsu, as he played the organ with other musicians for a short pre-concert.

Anyway, on to the review of the Blu-ray:  Even as someone who attended the North American concert, I greatly enjoy and appreciate the production quality of this disc, as it is phenomenal.  I actually imported it from amazon.jp when it was first released, but this is the exact same version.  The audio quality and video quality are superb, and this Blu-ray is a significant upgrade from the previous Distant Worlds DVD.  The disc plays perfectly on my North American PS3.  There are two different viewing modes; one pans around the musicians and switches to cutscenes from various games, and the other focuses only on the musicians themselves.  Also, the program does provide English subtitles.

The booklet packaged with the disc is welcomed, and it in English as well as Japanese.  The differences I noticed between the N.A. concert and this one were Susan Calloway did not sign Eyes on Me, but it was rather performed by Leona Lewis.  Even though I've been a fan of Susan's work, I do prefer Leona's rendition.  Additionally, The Opera from FFVI was of course sung in Japanese.  Some of the pieces presented in this concert have yet to be recorded on CD, and therefore this is the only piece of media where you can obtain them.

I highly recommend this concert experience for not only fans of the Distant Worlds concert series but also to those who appreciate Final Fantasy music and video game music in general.  Anyone who enjoys orchestral music will be able to have a fantastic visual and auditory experience.  I seem to never get sick of listening to Nobuo Uematsu's work, and this purchase was incredibly worthwhile as it can be revisited at any point.

If you have not had the chance to attend a Final Fantasy concert in person, I hope you are able to in the future.  For now, this is the next best thing.",1394582400,4,2156,4.6888297872340425
8441426,5,B004UC9NP2,"Celebrating the 25th Anniversary of Final Fantasy, Distant Worlds, the world travelling Final Fantasy concert, gives us a new concert experience: The Celebration. In every possible way, this concert is superior to the first video release on DVD, Returning Home.  Now on Blu-ray the picture is crisper, the music is fuller, add to that a newer and better song selection, fresher and exciting arrangements, and everything is better this time around. While the concert itself may be shorter, 120 minutes vs. the 151 minutes for Returning Home, it feels more like an experience. It's the next best thing to being there in person. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone who loves Final Fantasy, or anyone who is curious about how people can love game music so passionately.

This Blu-ray has a booklet inside, mostly Japanese, containing track listings, pictures, singer, composer and performer profiles, a message from Nobuo Uematsu and the words to ""Answers"" and ""Eyes on Me"". The concert begins with a quick video history of dates and scenes of the Final Fantasy games as ""Prelude"" is played, and ends with more scenes as ""Prologue"" is played.

It is cheaper to get the two CDs that have all this music on them, so I'll advise buying those instead of this DVD set.",1311897600,,323,4.046875
