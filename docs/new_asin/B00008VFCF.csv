7987309,5,B00008VFCF,"Since the Animated Series was a huge hit, this cute TV movie (based on the series) was made when the show ended and before the spin-off of the series (Sabrina's Secret Life) started airing. While I have not seen Sabrina's Secret Life, I enjoyed watching the animated series when it first aired, and recently viewed this movie as well.

The movie revolves around Sabrina, our favorite teenage witch, who upon turning 13 has to attend the Witch Academy. Feeling different from the others, because she is only a half-witch (and half a mortal), she has trouble fitting in. However, as the story progresses, she realizes who her true friends are, and what is really important in life.

The story is well-paced with unexpected twists and turns, and leaves us with morals that are not only important to witches, but to the viewers like us as well. The animation is great, and even the people who gave their voices to the characters did a good job. All in all, this is a great movie to see whether you are a fan of the show or not.",1099526400,7,1023,4.524324324324325
7987310,5,B00008VFCF,"This full-length animated feature is excellent, and much better than any single episode of the animated Sabrina TV series. There's more magic! Tons of zaps and spells.
The voices are different, however. Emily Hart, Melissa's younger sister, did the voice of cartoon Sabrina in the series, while Melissa did the voices for Aunts Hilda and Zelda. Not on this DVD, but that doesn't matter. Salem sounds more like Paul Lynde, but that's ok too.
Buy it, buy it, buy it!",1052956800,7,464,4.8125
