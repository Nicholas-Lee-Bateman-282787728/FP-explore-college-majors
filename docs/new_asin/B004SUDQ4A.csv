4464535,3,B004SUDQ4A,"Here's a sweet little ditty to rock-a-by Baby to sleep by!  Very interesting plot paralleling the experiences of many, who believe they have been abducted by aliens.  But, alien is an OT Term sometimes used to denote sinister forces; possibly even demonic presences.  And who's to say they aren't demons as a modern theological interpretation would state about the Visitors.  I lean to demonic forces than those visiting from out there!  Stranger things exist; my dear Horatio, than can be explained by all of your philosophies: to parallel the Bard of Avon!",1405555200,,558,5.021739130434782
4464536,3,B004SUDQ4A,"Some good jumps, creepy story and some of the special effects were awesome. But definitely lacking, not as scary as we hoped.",1377561600,,125,4.7272727272727275
4464537,5,B004SUDQ4A,"This is one of my personal favorites.  Dark, low key and creepy.  It's not a blood bath like some Wes Craven movies; it's more subtle.",1371772800,,134,4.32
4464538,3,B004SUDQ4A,"Fear of the dark is a common phobia but it's not real. It's in the mind. Or is it? This movie tries to make a case for basing that fear in reality. Doesn't do such a hot job of it.

Here's the scoop. Julia young, (Laura Regan looking like a young Mia Farrow) while knocking on the door of her Masters in Psychology, is in the presence of one of her patients, Billy, who suffers from night terrors when he kills himself. As she herself suffered the same malady as a child she's traumatized by the event. She meets two of his friends at the funeral who reiterate Billy's feeling that that the fear is not irrational but that beings 'on the other side' target victims and, at some time, drag them over. Strange events begin to suggest he might be right.

There are some reviewers who want to champion this film and I can see why. A person wrestling with personal demons and trying to determine fantasy from reality makes for a good story. Somehow, though, this just didn't come off. This sort of thing has been done before and I always liked the way the better versions see-sawed the case of reality vs. insanity. Here they didn't make enough case for her going off the deep end, so I pretty much figured the 'other side' was real. Plus: Here they needed the constant rain, and threats of New York City summer power outages to facilitate a dark setting where the demons can emerge. What if your in some place where those aren't an issue? Do the demons leave those kids alone? Too many issues like that in the movie. Things did ramp up in the third act and I found myself more involved. Maybe because the threat was becoming more palpable. And the final scene was genuinely nifty.

This is generally acted and directed well. All the production values were as good as they needed to be. It just needed a better script to put it over the top.",1368144000,,1836,4.378299120234604
4464539,5,B004SUDQ4A,This movie is still as scary to my son as when it came out the first time and seems to be one of the only movies that have ever scared him.,1352764800,,139,3.5161290322580645
4464540,5,B004SUDQ4A,"I love this movie, watched it a few times on cable tv, went ahead and bought the DVD because I really enjoy a good thriller sometimes, and even though I have seen it a few times I still enjoy watching it occasionally.  Ok I also enjoy looking at Laura Regan, and in one scene she show's alot of skin, though don't expect a full body shot.
Their are a few times in the scary scenes if you pause and move forward slowly you can see the good detail they gave to the scary :)  Though if you have not seen this movie before I recomend watching it all the way through before going back and looking at these scenes for the detail, so as to stay engrossed in the movie.",1333324800,,661,4.076923076923077

4464542,1,B004SUDQ4A,"Here is a story of a total of four young adults who recall their night terrors that were actually real for some reason when they were about five. Why were the monsters real? How long did they abduct them for? And why did they return them back to only then take them again when they were fully grown?

And why just those few selected people? Why them? What did they do that was so bad that THEY came for them? The whole story was sort of pointless. All they do is try to figure out some things and then just evade them until THEY inevitiably take them back to their realm. Whatever..

And THEY can even kill the lights and even turn off the fire like a faucet. None of it made sense. And these few selected people didn't even have a fighting chance. How were they supposed to fight them? How were they supposed to survive and get on with their lives?

This story doesn't tell why it was those few that were unfortunately chosen. It doesn't tell you how THEy can knock out all power and keep a zippo lighter from igniting a flame or how they can make a car turn off. It doesn't tell you what chance they ever had winning the battle and to be able to lead a normal life like everyone else around them. All you do is just watch all three remaining people get taken back in, with no fighting chance, no way to stop those creatures. These 3 remaining people in their mid-20s never had a chance. What fun was that? In every story, there's usually always a way to stop the evil creatures that comes for them. This story never showed how they could've stopped them. And what's the point of light stopping them if they can just kill the lights whenever hey wanted. THEY could've taken them back anytime they wanted. It was a completely hopeless campaign for the four young adults who never had a fighting chance with so much unexplained in the story..",1129852800,6,1841,4.315028901734104
4464543,3,B004SUDQ4A,"It starts out slow. When it becomes a bit interesting, the whole plot gives way to basic chase. Scenes with no depth, and why don't these people carry a flash light.

4464569,3,B004SUDQ4A,"Personally, I've always liked this movie. It has a simple concept and explores it fully, which is a nice counterpoint to all the movies that just throw every idea against the wall to see if it will stick. The CGI is a bit dated, but they leave enough to the imagination that it's still creepy. I'll probably watch this three-star horror again.",1439164800,,343,4.548387096774194

4464575,3,B004SUDQ4A,"As far as ANY movie goes I give this 3 stars, but would definitely award 4 if we were limiting comparisons only to other horror films. Don't let the ""Wes Craven Presents"" tagline fool you--this isn't just another ragtag group of twenty-somethings being picked off by supernatural forces, but rather includes decent character studies and a premise, atmosphere, and effects that are genuinely creepy. The movie also instills a general sense of hopelessness for the characters, not just in terms of their inevitably grim fates but also for their bleak existences, that actually me had me caring about and rooting for them.",1436400000,5,619,5.078431372549019

4464577,2,B004SUDQ4A,"You could do worse in Amazon Prime for free, but you could also read a book instead. Or re-watch a good movie.

Rubber creatures, predictable situations and outcomes. You know it's bad when you're really pining for one of the protagonists to die. To be fair, it's not horrible-horrible, but just look for something else.

Don't be fooled by the premise with its references to night terrors. It's what drew me in.",1434931200,,412,4.708333333333333

Was it a great movie? Maybe not but ""great"" is subjective. Like many movies, there are parts that do not fit reality but come on, that's why we watch them.",1433116800,,329,4.238095238095238

4464587,4,B004SUDQ4A,"Okay, it wasn't the greatest movie I've ever seen, but putting aside the critics trashing of this decent movie, I decided to give it a shot. Who are these so called ""critics"" anyway? Must be nice to have a job where you can be COMPLETELY WRONG at least 50% of the time and STILL HAVE A JOB!? Anyway, this freaky little flick was free on my Prime membership, so I could always just kill it. Well, I gotta say, it was quite a bit better than I thought! It is a lot better than some of the really cheesy stuff coming out on the SCFI channel lately I can tell you that! This movie had quality sound and dubbing, the cinema shooting was as good as anything going on cable tight now. The creatures were well done --leaving a lot to the imagination, but showing the twisty, gray, horrors well enough to give you a small case of the shivers. The lead actress had this anorexic-Mia Farrow type thing going on. I couldn't stop staring at her...well..her bones. The Woman didn't have a curve on her body. Anyway, the plot was quite good; childhood boogeyman terrorize small children. The children were thought to be suffering from intense night terrors. After some time, the children grow up, and their nightmares seem to have gone away...until one by one they discover that they are MARKED;  mysterious sores begin to appear...like an omen of things to come.  Soon the terrors come back to finish what they started! Actually this movie was waaaay better than I thought it would be. I think you guys should give it a look-see. It's one of the better Prime horror genre flicks.",1432166400,3,1565,4.507042253521127

4464621,3,B004SUDQ4A,"Apparently the target audience was people who had experienced ""night terrors"" as children; whether or not adults experience this psychological impediment isn't made clear. As someone who never had such experiences it was difficult for me to latch onto the terror aspect the filmmakers were trying to convey.
Most of the movie seemed as cold and clinical as the Masters degree oral defense she was preparing for.
The plot implies that all children who experienced night terrors will someday end up in bogey land but they completely failed to establish the supernatural foundation for this premise or for the entire movie for that matter.

so the movie seems to float effortlessly towards the inevitable disappearance of our heroine and her childhood friends; end of story.

the gimmick of pulling a 4"" wooden peg out of her skull made no sense whatsoever, especially since none of her other friends had made mention of being marked in such a manner except for the red blotches.

I can't even say that this film is episodic; but if it is, it is only marginally so.
No explanation is offered about the entities that abduct their victims, what becomes of them, etc.

The film not only lacks a foundation; half the house is missing as well. Where are we going with all this?

There were a few parts I wish had been done a different way, but I haven't enjoyed a movie that much since I saw Quarantine at 3AM in a pitch black basement with surround sound. I am one of the harshest critics when it comes to video entertainment, so when I enjoy a film well enough to buy the DVD, then you were likely talking on your cell or posting on Facebook with this playing in the background for rating it so poorly. I had a friend watch part of it and he got spooked enough to ask me to turn it off.

Completely average. Does a good job mixing psychology with true horror (for the character). I watched the streaming version and don't know if it's the released ending or alternate ending. The acting is terrible for 90% of the movie, until the main character actually starts to unravel.

To be blunt, the movie does nothing to explain anything of what's going on. They set up a premise, introduce the actors, events start rolling and then it ends without any explanations as to ANYTHING related to their night terrors, the monsters/aliens/demons, and the ending was pathetic. It's as if they just ended it because they knew it sucked.

Honestly, this movie should have either been a boob-fest like Roger Corman flicks or something spoofy because all excitement and thrill was dashed expertly.

This would have been a lot better if the characters didn't constantly and stupidly put themselves in danger by wandering into dark places alone even though they know they need to stay in the light.

But the wretched 45 minutes that I viewed was so bad, the second half would have had to have been Godfather quality to get this clunker out of the one-star range.

4464767,2,B004SUDQ4A,"The key to whether you will enjoy this film or not is based purely on what you require out of a horror flick to enjoy it.  For instance, with me, when it comes to horror flicks, it's necessary that good defeats evil, and that we eventually find out what the evil was, and why it was there.  If you're anything like me, well, you won't like the film, because it gives you none of that.  There's no background to the threat, no reason for the threat to exist, no explanation of why the threat exists, and all it really says is ""life sucks.""  There's not even a ""life sucks, get over it"" feeling.  It's just a ""life sucks"" film.

So, why then does it get 2 stars? Well, if Craven had put an extra 15 minutes into the film and explained everything, given an origin and an eventual end to the threat/evil/horror (and I don't even care if it's crazy talk, like Scientology or Giant Pink unicorns taking over the galaxy--it's a horror movie. You give up your right to reality once you start watching), and had even the smallest dash of hope at the end, it could EASILY have been a 4 star film.  The acting was superb.  The build up of suspense and release were excellent throughout, but as I said in the first paragraph, that's all there is.  There's no explanation what the threat is, no idea in the least as to what the threat is, or how it exists, or how it can be defeated, or, or, or...  And it has a crappy, lack of an ending.  It's not as bad as a 1 star because there WERE good features to the film, and if all you wanted to do was be scared, well, it accomplished that.  For those who ask for a bit more out of a film (read: I, the reviewer, require quite a bit more out of a film to call it good), skip it.  Really... don't waste your time.  Pop on over to the HBO documentary series of Autopsy, or pull up some forensic files.  At least then you'll get some answers.",1408406400,,1870,4.155555555555556

4464783,3,B004SUDQ4A,"This is the story of a 12 year old boy with a severe eating disorder, which leads to impaired judgement and delusional hallucinations, most notably manifesting themselves in the form of night terrors.  The boy has a grownup friend who kills himself.  He then meets two of his adult friends' aquantences, who also suffer from night terrors, but appear to have more healthy appetites.  For some reason, the young man only associated with adults, and is even in a romantic relationship with a real live fireman!

Seriously, this could have been done so much better.  In fact, the only scary part of the entire movie is the leading lady's nude scene.  It was like viewing archive footage of Auschwitz during WWII.  I had flashbacks to the transparent man anatomical models we used in biology class as I watched every sinewy tendon slither oh so un-seductively over her bulging scapulae.

The entire cast is good, except for the lead, who has the dramatic range of a banana.  She conveys her emotions about as effectively as my 4 year old daughter blaming a broken vase on her imaginary friend.  Actually, her imaginary friend is more believable than Laura Regan's performance in this film, and has more depth than her character, too. (BTW, what a needy, pain in the butt B-word her character is!  The fireman should have dumped her by the 3rd scene, but apparently he likes codependent nags with fully visible spinal cords)

The premise is solid, if not a bit cliche, but it should have been delivered in a way that wasn't so straightforward.  I mean, the dead character's journal guiding the other characters bit has been done to death and back again.  Apparently Wes Craven will put his name on anything for a buck these days.

In the end, this is a predictable little spooky movie meant to pull at your nostalgia strings, and it does a decent job of that for a while.  I recommend watching this as background noise to other activities, like housework.  I wouldn't make a bowl of popcorn and waste my time actually paying full attention to it, though.

4464838,4,B004SUDQ4A,"While the FX's are excellent and the story line is solid, based as it is on one of mankind's oldest childhood tales of terror, his integration with real world child psychology and the brilliant direction make this film not only one of his best, but one that still gives me a chill, even after having personally studied the craft, knowing how it all works, and having seen the film several times before.  Laura Regan is great as Julia Lund, the young psychology student whose childhood friend Billy Parks [Jon Abrahams] discovers that the night terrors they had as children were something much more dangerous than simple childhood fears.  After Billy's death, she finds that his college friends Sam Burnside [Ethan Embry] and Terry Alba [Dagmara Dominczyk] also belonged to this small club of adults who had been visited by night terrors as children.  As she uncovers more similarities between them all, she also discovers that they are all in mortal danger from a dark world populated by a deadly and desperately hungry species whose entry points into our world can be any dark corner or lightless closet.",1405814400,,1105,4.898395721925134
