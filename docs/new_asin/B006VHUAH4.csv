5020614,1,B006VHUAH4,"David Attenborough is a gem, a jewel, a treasure, but this program does not do him the justice he deserves.  The interviewer was difficult to understand because of her accent, and she probably speaks more words than Attenborough.  The director seems to think that talking heads are boring, because the film keep shifting away from Attenborough to provide, apparently, visual interest.  But when the subject is someone as articulate as David Attenborough, switching away to man in the street interviews is distracting and irritating in the extreme.  The random interviewees add nothing, but only distract from what Sir David has to say. To hear one of the anonymous people say they know very little about Darwin is a waste of the viewers' time, especially when Sir David has much to say on the subject.

Add to that the insipid music that plays while Attenborough is talking, and the program becomes almost unwatchable.

David Attenborough is a unique individual, and he deserves better treatment than he received.

If this world were fair, Amazon would refund my money.",1334361600,7,1069,5.0397727272727275
8504981,2,B006VHUAH4,"If you are a die-hard Attenborough fan like myself, don't waste your time with this DVD.  Not only is it poorly edited and rambling in its ideas, my the biggest problem I have with this film is the heavy, non-native English speaking narration.  While I'm sure she did her best, even after living in abroad for 14 years in five different countries, I had to deeply concentrate to be sure to catch the narration...which would then remind me how poorly the script was written.  Someone else stated that ""Sir David deserves more than this.""  I couldn't agree more.

I did give it two stars (vs one) as the overwhelming highlights are interview segments that I'd never seen or heard before.",1391904000,,685,4.675

8504984,3,B006VHUAH4,"I really think that David Attenborough deserves better.  Shallow and not thoroughly professionally done, especially the interviews with Sir David.",1367452800,,146,6.3
8504985,5,B006VHUAH4,"David Attenborough as the topic! Enjoyed Passion for Life's insight into his career history, part biography, part interview. Great show!",1363564800,,136,5.85
8504986,3,B006VHUAH4,"I could listen to David Attenborough read the phone book. When the discovery channel gets American celebrities to narrate airings of BBC nature specials I wait to order the Attenborough versions through DVDs or download. On top of that,  I am enthralled by almost any informative program. My standards aren't high- I have even rented physics lectures. I found this program dull, uninformative, and my desire to learn about a lifelong hero on a deeper level is unsatisfied.",1355875200,4,472,5.051282051282051
8504987,5,B006VHUAH4,Fresh perspective about evolution and life in general. I would recommend it to anyone looking for inspiration. I recommend other works of David Attenborough as well.,1353715200,,165,5.384615384615385
8504988,5,B006VHUAH4,"This documentary was great.  I really enjoy watching videos on evolution, and this really opened up my eyes about different issues with Darwin and evolution.  This really got me interested even more than I was.  I loved how it touched all the different aspects of family as well. Great presentation.",1353715200,,299,4.94

To be honest, I had no idea who David Attenborough is until I watched 'Charles Darwin and the Tree of Life' where he made a great impression on me. I started searching for more info about him and I found this interesting documentary. It was extraordinary. Especially I liked the way sir David presented his views on evolution, social issues and life. It is no accident... there is nothing more contagious than passion for life. I recommend this documentary film to everyone.",1353196800,5,662,6.366666666666666
8504990,5,B006VHUAH4,"Awesome doc !!!  Great meeting with a great man. Authentic, enthusiastic narrator, even though the British accent is sometimes a bit hard to understand. I learned so much from this film about Attenborough's life. I didn't know he was a director of the BBC. I loved the bits with people being involved in the discussion on evolution, that made me feel like one of them not being left out and relaxed the seriousness around Darwinian conflicts. I greatly enjoyed this film!  Intelligent, veritable, warm and informative. It is a great film and definitely a must watch for everyone!!!",1337472000,6,581,4.918367346938775
