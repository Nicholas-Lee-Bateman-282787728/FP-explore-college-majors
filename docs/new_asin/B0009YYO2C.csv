2343955,5,B0009YYO2C,"This is my second pregnancy and I don't have time to make it to classes like I did the first time around.  I've used several prenatal exercise dvds and have found this to be one of the best, mainly because the instuctions are very clear.  It might not be for you if you're looking for something to get your heart rate up, etc. but it is a great yoga workout.",1138579200,17,358,4.1
2343956,5,B0009YYO2C,"I am eight months pregnant and have used this wonderful yoga practice DVD since 14 weeks into my pregnancy.  What a great resource!  Not only do the three  routines help me to safely exercise and ""decompress"" after a hectic day, but I know that I'm learning poses and breathing techniques that can help prepare my body and mind for labor.  I have taken this DVD on business trips so I could continue my yoga practice in the hotel room - what a relief after hours on an airplane!  I also attend Patty Slote's prenatal yoga class and she does a wonderful job of recreating the relaxing class environment in the video.  As a woman at the end of the third trimester (and experiencing new discomforts daily), I definitely recommend this DVD.",1133913600,12,736,4.580152671755725
2343957,5,B0009YYO2C,I bought this video early on but have been too sick to even try it... I'm now 22 weeks pregnant and finally able to feel like trying it!  It is wonderful!  It has three different routines and it great!  Very easy to follow.  Try it out!!,1132876800,10,237,4.086956521739131
2343958,5,B0009YYO2C,"I have the privilege of participating in Patty Slote's prenatal yoga classes in person, and every single time I attend class I feel so much more relaxed and at peace with myself and my pregnancy. This video allows me to bring that feeling home with me. Patty's voice is calming and comforting, the yoga moves are wonderful for working out the kinks of pregnancy and the music is peaceful and not distracting. I would highly recommend this DVD for anyone who is looking to benefit from prenatal yoga at home!",1121385600,19,507,4.644444444444445
8070783,5,B0009YYO2C,"I have never taken any yoga class, so I am not sure on the legitimacy of the moves, etc. However, I can say that the DVD is very easy to understand and to follow. I am on my 2nd trimester and the poses are easy enough that they do not seem harmful to me and my baby in any way. Yet I can feel that I have worked out afterward. My body just seems more toned and ready. They give you alternate poses too if you find any of the poses inconvenient. This DVD makes a yoga novice like me enjoy practicing it. Very relaxing!",1243728000,,517,3.933333333333333
8070784,4,B0009YYO2C,"I found this DVD during my first pregnancy, after several missteps with Shiva Rea (boring, slow, not very helful) and Jennifer Wolfe (long, repetitive).  This DVD is wonderful because it is divided into sections.  You can choose which parts to do depending on the day, your mood.  It's not extremely physically challenging, but the poses feel wonderful and are great to practice anytime you have the need.  It's relaxing, with clear instructions.  I also like the Sun Salutation DVD this company made, which is a nice,brief compliment to these exercies and really help me start the day off right.",1238198400,,596,4.97979797979798
8070785,5,B0009YYO2C,I got this for my friend who is pregnant and was bummed out when her Yoga class got cancled. She really seems to enjoy it and has used it quite a bit! From all I can tell she loves it and was super happy to get it!,1199145600,,214,3.574468085106383
8070786,3,B0009YYO2C,"I ordered this DVD when I was at the end of my second/entering my 3rd tri-mester. I tried the 3rd session, which is recommended for the 3rd trimester and I found one of the positions very uncomfortable and not able to do it. I am not overly big, and I have only gain 24 1/2 pounds, and I am on my 35th week, however, I found this one particular position unobtainable. Besides this I would suggest for viewers to have a soft floor to lay on and lots of room to move around.",1198627200,,472,4.086021505376344
8070787,5,B0009YYO2C,"I have been using yoga videos for 6 years.  Now that I am late in my second trimester of pregnancy I have found some of the traditional yoga poses are becoming difficult and uncomfortable. Prenatal Yoga seems to be more gentle and appropriate for the pregnant body, while still providing opportunity for muscle tone.  I have also liked how there are three routines that each last between 23 and 32 minutes, so one session is a perfect length for me to fit into my morning schedule.  I have not tried any of the breathing relaxation exercises, but imagine that this woudl be useful preparation for childbirth.",1198022400,2,608,4.716981132075472
8070788,5,B0009YYO2C,"I am so glad I bought this DVD, it has everything I wanted plus some stuff I didn't know I'd want.  Before I bought it I used only Shiva Rea's yoga DVD almost every day for a few months and I needed variety.  It has done a lot to lessen my hip pain (which was making it nearly impossible to move around before I started) and done a lot to help me relax and deal with anxiety problems and practice relaxations I will use in childbirth.

Pros
- It does a fabulous job of training you to move with your breath, which is what yoga is all about and is a great preparation for labor.
- The exercises are challenging but not too hard.
- The exercises really focus on positions that will help you during labor.
- There are three stand alone routines of about 20-30 minutes each so you can do just one a day or do a few in a row if you want a longer workout.  After four or five months of doing the exact same workout every day this is a huge bonus.
- There are special features so you can choose to listen to just the music or just the instructions once you're familiar with the exercises.
- The way they put it together is very relaxing.
- It also contains three separate guided relaxations so that you can rotate around and do different ones on different days.
- This DVD was put together by a yoga center instead of an individual yoga teacher and as a result I think the routines are better and the DVD overall has a lot more to it.

Cons
- The exercises may not be challenging enough earlier in your pregnancy if you already have been doing a lot of yoga.  I didn't get this until my 3rd trimester and it was great then because it's so hard to move around when you're so big, but it might be too easy if you do it in the beginning. Even if this is too easy for you at first, I still highly recommend you give it a try in your 3rd trimester.
- If you're not into the more spiritual side of yoga the quiet relaxations and things that are so great about this DVD may not appeal to you.",1196812800,5,1978,4.046035805626598
8070789,2,B0009YYO2C,"This DVD is good for pregnant women who have never done yoga before and are also in bad shape. If you have experience in Yoga or if you used to excercise regulary before your pregnancy, this DVD is not for you.",1196208000,3,210,4.146341463414634
8070790,5,B0009YYO2C,"I've never done yoga before, but found this DVD easy to follow and so very, very helpful with the aches and pains of pregnancy. The instructions and clear, and the narrator's voice calm. After doing the video once, I rarely looked at the screen. There were some poses/movements that I liked better than others, so as I learned which one worked for me, it was easy to pause to do those I like for more repetitions and FFWD through those that didn't work for me. The DVD was particularly helpful during my 3rd trimester...instead of alternating my prenatal exercise DVD with the prenatal yoga, I went exclusively to yoga!",1195084800,,619,4.6880733944954125
8070791,5,B0009YYO2C,"I'm not a huge yogie, but did do some yoga -about once/week before PG. I love the flexibility of doing my Yoga at home, so I wanted a DVD and not a class. This DVD is perfect!! It has three routines -

  * seated and kneeling poses
  * standing and seated poses
  * side lying poses

and you can do one, two or all three at a time. (the range from 23 -32 mins each). Also, there are three different relaxation routines that you can choose from. (approx 10 mins each)

The workout feels just right for me. If I was a serious yogie I might want a bit more strenuous of a workout - but it's certainly more than enough to get the energy and blood moving and some good stretches, and get that great 'after yoga' feeling going. Of course you can reach/stretch more or less. The instructions are super clear too.

They include lots of modifications to do as you get bigger so I think that will be good too. AND...it's true yoga from a real yoga studio - centering breaths and balance etc. and not just doing the poses -that was important to me.

Lastly, they have practice sheets that you can download and take with you if you are traveling -which is very handy.

Edited to add -while I did this DVD I ran into some problems where i couldn't do one of the poses and I e-mailed the company and they sent me another modification suggestion with picture included -within 2 days!! How cool is that!!",1176940800,13,1388,4.255725190839694
8070792,5,B0009YYO2C,"This is a really gentle yoga program that can be as challenging as you make it.  I was able to use the DVD from the time I found out I was pregnant, and I am restarting my yoga practice with it after having given birth a month ago.  I have practiced yoga for over 20 years and was still impressed with the quality of this DVD and the 3 sessions and 3 relaxations.",1165968000,8,363,3.958904109589041
