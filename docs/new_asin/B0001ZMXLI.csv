2046867,3,B0001ZMXLI,"A productive approach for young children of adapting Jules Verne's classic novel Journey to the Center of the Earth was found for HOT DIGGETY DAWG (1995), a segment of the highly popular half-hour PBS children's series WISHBONE.  Wishbone is a Jack Russell terrier, enlivening his mundane life by imagining himself cast in famous stories--essentially a beginner's version of the old ""Classics Illustrated"" comic books.

 Each WISHBONE episode presents two parallel tales, alternating back and forth.  In the prosaic framing story, Wishbone is an ordinary family pet, providing an anthropomorphized canine perspective, while  in the inset story he becomes an appropriately costumed canine, enacting a lead in a classic tale.  Retaining the body of a dog in Wishbone's daydreams as he interacts with people as if he were one of them echoes the desire of small children to be treated as ""grown-ups"" and be able to live the seemingly freer possibilities of adult experience.

 In HOT DIGGETY DAWG, written by Jack Wesley and directed by Fred Holmes, digging a hole for an Arbor Day tree allows Wishbone to imagine himself as Professor Lidenbrock in a series of Verne's incidents with Axel (Jonathan Brent) and Hans (Matthew Thompkins), including giving his last mouthful of water to Axel.

 Back on the surface, the children are fascinated with a gold medallion that Wishbone has dug up.  Returning to the story of Journey to the Center of the Earth, the discovery leads to an underground river inside the rocks, to relieve the explorer's thirst.  The explorers are thrown out of the volcano in Italy when the family accidentally digs into a water pipe.

 In a staple of this series, at the conclusion Wishbone narrates several minutes showing how the special effects were created to depict Verne's Journey to the Center of the Earth--an unusually direct acknowledgment of the fictional nature of the story.  This lack of pretense allows HOT DIGGETY DAWG to succeed in simultaneously telling two separate but complimentary stories.  HOT DIGGETY DAWG cleverly and charmingly conveys the novel's tone and plot in a series of vignettes, overcoming its brevity.",1210896000,3,2153,5.179190751445087
2046868,2,B0001ZMXLI,"I love the series for the tricks and ""acting"" of the Jack Russells. Wishbone merely walks around in costume in this one. The story itself is fairly boring.",1210723200,2,155,4.571428571428571
2046869,5,B0001ZMXLI,"I remember coming home from Highschool back when Wishbone was still being aired on PBS and watching the episodes every afternoon with my little sister who, at the time, was about 10.  She and I are both adults now and we both remember how much we loved watching the series after school.  Because I think Wishbone was such a phenomenal show suitable for children of all ages I have been trying to purchase the DVDs for my daughter.  I feel that she would enjoy, and benefit, from the love of literature that imaginative little dog has.  This is definately something I recommend parents to invest for their children to open them up to the special gift of reading and to expose them to the blessings of great literature this vast planet has been given by talented writers.",1182470400,11,769,4.591240875912408

8018931,5,B0001ZMXLI,"I love Wishbone! Hoping they offer more titles on DVD. If you've not watched ""Wishbone "", these are wonderful synopses of classics set around a boy and his dog ( or a dog and his boy) and their family/community. These not animatedly and heartwarming. A lesson is always available by the end that pertains to Wishbone's boy(Joe) predicament or dilemma. This particular episode features Jules Vern's ""Journey to the Center of the Earth "". These are wonderful and gentle viewing for young people...and you get a ""Cliff Notes"" version of the classic!",1463788800,,546,4.945652173913044

8018938,5,B0001ZMXLI,Remember these?  Wishbone combines present live-action with literary settings...all featuring a dog whose thoughts we get to hear...and this is a smart dog.  Good addition for homeschooling - for alternative viewing to cartoons.  In this case it presents Jules Verne in a way that kids may appreciate and perhaps even draw them into reading the classic.  Wishbone is gradually fading from memories - use this to bring the little dog back.,1398643200,2,438,5.126760563380282
