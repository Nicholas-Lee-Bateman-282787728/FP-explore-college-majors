2352404,1,B000A2UBHU,"Hi all. I have been hearing your discontent as to the fact that there are no full JL box sets being released. My boyfriend's bday is coming up and he is a huge fan, so I was wondering if anyone could suggest which JL DVD's to get instead? I saw something on this site about Kozak selling the first two seasons... All help is much appreciated. Thanks! Lillian",1127088000,,358,4.279411764705882
2352405,1,B000A2UBHU,"As most of the reviewers have noted, why does WB insist on releasing these pathetic 3-episodes-per-disk DVDs?  I would willingly pay for JLA Season 1, 2, etc.  In fact, I would pay for the whole series in a single box set.  Three episodes per disk is annoying, at best.

Please WB, get a clue and release JLA the way you did Superman & Batman . . .

Now, if we can just get Fox to release X-Men & Spider-Man in Box Sets!!!!! . . .",1125360000,71,430,4.011764705882353
2352406,1,B000A2UBHU,"I've purchased the previous Justice League DVDs, but I refuse to purchase this one or any others that come out. I'm sick of WB's ridiculous marketing strategy with releasing these mesely volumes. Is it so hard to release DVD boxsets? Judging from evidence, we can expect WB to release the Justice League boxset in the year 2015! Oh, but that's just the first season. The season 2 boxset will be released later in 2018! Yay! I officially give WB the 'worst at satisfying customers' award. Way to go, WB! :)",1124496000,13,505,4.622222222222222
2352407,2,B000A2UBHU,"I just compared my Justice League Unlimited VHS recordings (that I made from the original airings) to my DVD copy of Justice League Unlimited: Saving the World (S 1 V 1).  The process used to make the image fullscreen is DEFINITELY your typical pan & scan of the original widescreen version. I went through segments of each episode frame-by-frame to make sure.  For the laymen: the sides of the widescreen picture have been hacked down to make a TV proportioned image and then that image has been expanded to fill your TV screen. Roughly 30% of the picture has been removed.

Sadly, the packaging on JLU: Saving the World lies to the consumer when it states: ""Standard Version: Presented in a format preserving the aspect ration of its original television exhibition"".  This is simply not the case... I have recordings of the ""original television exhibitions"" and they two items do NOT match.

The information on the packaging is misleading to the consumer and I feel this fact could form the basis of a class action lawsuit.

Someday the stuffed shirts at Warner Brothers home video will figure out what their customers want. Unfortunately while the rest of the DVD industry has fully embraced the widescreen DVD format (it fits those new widescreen TVs better... duh!) AND issuing complete box sets of season series from their production vaults, WB is locked into the old school notion of trickling out incomplete and altered discs of their animated franchises.

What a shame!  -mattro",1123027200,29,1487,4.92
2352408,5,B000A2UBHU,"I'm a huge fan of the widescreen as well but there's something the other reviewers are forgetting. Bruce Timm did all the episodes as full screen but kept the action geared for widescreen and stripped off the top and bottom. Timm specifically did the visuals full screen for the main audience of Cartoon Network but then cropped out the top and bottom spefically for the more particular viewers like us. It's not the same lame case as many movies where they lop off the sides and blown up the image to fill the screen for pan and scan. You're not losing anything with these episodes.  Now that we have that in order...these three episodes are some of the best of the first season of the JLU (or third season of the JLichever you prefer). ""For the man who has everything"" is a fantastic adaptation of the alan Moore story. ""The Return"" and ""The Greatest Story Never Told""  are also two of the most well done episodes of the season as well. Enjoy!",1122163200,4,945,4.488372093023256
2352409,1,B000A2UBHU,"Like the previous Justice League Unlimited release, this disc will contain three episodes that have been cropped from their original widescreen presentation. The episodes will be:

For the Man Who Has Everything: Adapted from the Alan Moore comic. Superman is trapped in the perfect dream world by the villainous Mongul, and Batman and Wonder Woman have to save him. Strong, dramatic personal story for Superman, with some good acting, music, and animation all around.

The Return: The extended JLU roster must prevent the android AMAZO (voiced by Star Trek actor Robert Picardo) from taking revenge on Lex Luthor. This episode really shows off the new half-hour format, with a tightly-plotted story that has both epic action and strong characterizations. Toss in some surprise cameos and appearances with more great animation, and you have another winner.

The Greatest Story Never Told: While the League has an epic battle in downtown Metropolis, c-list glory hound Booster Gold learns what it means to be a true hero. A lighthearted comedy episode. Not as gripping as the other two episodes, but still well executed and worth checking out.

It's a shame really, if this disc was widescreen it'd be worth buying, as these episodes showcase the kind of stories JLU can tell in 30 minutes. But it's another cheap release from WB, with equally cheap cover art (old GL design, and also Aquaman, who isn't in these episodes). Why WB continues to flood the market with these releases instead of decent boxed sets the first time around is a mystery.",1121990400,119,1544,5.01953125
2352410,1,B000A2UBHU,Containing only 3 episodes on FULLSCREEN format & not in episode order I just cant understand what is going on with Warner Home Video. The 3 episodes on this DVD releases are v v good but then the extras and the episode quantity & order are such a big let down. The cover art on the DVD is wrong as well since Green Lantern & Superman got both revamped designs! Why they keep on doing this cheap stuff I cant understand. Hurry up and release the box sets for God's sake!,1121990400,11,470,4.175824175824176
2352471,2,B000A2UBHU,"The show is just too fiction unlike X-Men:Evolution, but the actions awesome as well. But was trying to find some romance/drama here but just couldn't./",1143158400,,152,5.12
2352472,5,B000A2UBHU,"I am a fan of the Justice league and found this DVD to be quite enjoyable. I got my grandchildren hooked and they are 2 and 3years of age. The stories in this series were exciting and (of course) had messages of caring for humanity. I recommend this and other series of this nature to everyone. <y husband is a physician for the past 27years and he loves the DVD and he enjoys the musical themes of these adventures. Enjoy!

2352474,5,B000A2UBHU,"I first became aware of the animated TV show, The Justice League when I came across some of the DVDs at my local library.  I loved the storylines and the first rate animation of the characters, but was disappointed by the way the episodes were released.  If you haven't been fortunate enough to have seen the Justice League from beginning to end, then you're in the dark when you watch episodes like, 'For the Man Who Has Everything'.  Happily the studio has decided to release The Justice League in full seasons.  According to one source, Justice League-The Complete First Season, will be available for sale in March of 2006, a 4 DVD set containing all 26 first season episodes(the first season will be in fullscreen format, while the remaining seasons will be in letterbox format)  It seems that dreams do come true!",1133913600,7,818,4.732394366197183
2352475,4,B000A2UBHU,"Another JL Unlimited DVD has trickled down from the Warner Brothers vault.  It seems they enjoy torturing fans by releasing one DVD a year with three episodes each!  That aside, these episodes are even better than the ones in Saving the World.

""The Man Who Has Everything"" - A total rip-off of the Batman: The Animated Series episode ""Perchance To Dream.""  It just puts Superman in Batman's place.  While the Mad Hatter had trapped Batman in a perfect dream world with a machine, Mongul has trapped Superman with an octopus/flower-like alien life form.  Superman is married to Lana, and has a son.  They live on Krypton, with Clark's parents.  While Superman is in this trance, Wonderwoman is fighting Mongul to rescue him.  This episode is very dramatic, and has Superman crying.

""The Return"" - Lex Luthor's indestructible android has come to Earth to kill him.  Legions of superheroes cannot stop the android.  Again, Lex Luthor's character design looks just like Harvey Dent from BTAS.  A good episode.

""The Greatest Story Never Told"" - The best on the disc.  Superhero Booster Gold has come from the future seeking fame and glory, but the only job the JL gives him is crowd control as an evil wizard attacks the city.  However, an even greater threat arises as a physics experiment goes awry and releases a black hole.  As Booster has no respect, he must deal with this all by himself.  Really, really great episode.  It shows what being a hero truly means.

The extras on this DVD are great.  In ""The Science of Superheroes,"" a jet-propulsion scientist speaks about the laws of physics and space, and how Superman and other heroes beat those laws.  In ""Voices of Justice,"" the voice actors for Green Lantern and Wonder Woman, and Andrea Romano, voice casting and director, provide a unique look into voice acting.",1133568000,3,1821,4.825242718446602

2352477,4,B000A2UBHU,"As I want to do the episodes on this DVD justice, I give it 4 stars.  These are some of the better, although not the best, episodes this incarnation of Justice League cartoons has to offer.  That being said, I must add my voice to those who call for season-by-season boxes of both ""The Justice League"" and ""Justice League Unlimited"".  Many of my favorite installments of both shows remain unavailable much to my chagrin.  C'mon Warner!  Please wise up!",1129766400,2,452,4.670886075949367
2352478,1,B000A2UBHU,"These DVDs continue to be bitter disappointments. They crop the image, they only put 3 on a CD, and they release them sporadically. This is the last one I will ever buy - I just got a DVD burner and I'll burn new episodes. For old episodes, just head over to ebay, there are some wonderfully produced bootleg sets out there. I just dropped $70 for seasons 1&2 - gorgeous case, menus, high quality widescreen, and even bonus features. It could have been Time-Warner's $70, but they continue to be stupid and greedy about their DVD sets.",1128988800,6,535,4.525773195876289

2352480,3,B000A2UBHU,"I have all but one of the previous releases of Justice League.  It's getting very tiresome to be waiting 4-6 months for a measly 3 episodes.  At least when they were releasing episodes from the first two seasons, they were including 4 episodes. And even Teen Titans has 6 per disc.  Come on WB....  Release season sets.  My rating was in the middle, because despite the crappy releases, this is still one of the best cartoons currently on tv.  There hasn't been an episode I didn't like.  But, the releases are a joke.  Someone commented on two of the characters on the cover not even being updated to their third season appearance.  Well.. .was Aquaman even in any of the episodes on this disc?  I am thinking he wasnt, so why is he on the cover art?  I hope this is  the last release like this and next time we see new Justice League DVDs, in season set form.",1127174400,3,861,4.345911949685535

After reading the reviews from people with younger children, I decided to purchase it.  Once I recieved it, the video stated ""PG""  (not G as it did on amazon)
I am sure this is a great video for older children, but I think the language and ""fighting evil"" is two old for my 3 year old... maybe when he is 6 or 7.",1231632000,,432,4.047058823529412
8072922,1,B000A2UBHU,"I bought this DVD for my 4 1/2 year old son.  We were watching it together and at first I found it a bit violent, a lot of talk about killing and dying.  My son loves superheroes and after two minutes it wnet into Superman's dream sequence where he was in bed with a woman, his wife.  It was morning and they started talking about the sex they had had the night before and how he couldn't come.  She said ""I couldn't have gotten you off if I had thrown a bomb in this bed.""  Is that dialogue for a 4 year old???  If there is blatant adult content in this video why does it say ""DC COmics Kids Collection"" across the top???  Just one more reason to make sure you know what your kids are watching.  IT is also way too violent for young kids.  THis is NOT ""Superfriends.""",1191369600,4,768,4.066666666666666
8072923,5,B000A2UBHU,"This is no SuperFriends. The stories and dialog have enough in jokes and secondary comic characters to make this a better than average cartoon show.  I read DC comics when I was a child and didn't see the characters for over 20 years, yet the show reminded me that I read stories of Booster Gold, Red Tornado, Hal Jordan/Green Latern.  Even if you don't know the characters the stories are enjoyable.  I also prefer the more realistic animation to the Titans/LSH style.",1182556800,2,469,4.695121951219512
