2268366,5,B00096S2SW,"abs routines can be so boring and repetive, but not this one; LEISA HART is great at creating fun and divers workouts that are off the beaten path, and i love the sexiness(and not cheesiness) of this video. My abs are toning up and i feel sexy enough to wear shirts that show my mid section; i am not there yet, but i am getting there, and it feels great; Leisa is a great instructor.",1130371200,,384,4.133333333333334
2268367,5,B00096S2SW,"i have bought dozens of tapes targeting the abs, and i think this is one of the best; it is creative and effective; i truly enjoyed the set and the pace, it was well structured and has firm up my mid section after laying off for a few months, this is a great addition to my fitness vidoe collection",1129248000,2,298,4.067796610169491
2268368,5,B00096S2SW,"I have had a difficult time doing traditional ab workouts for various reasons, but I found that Leisa Hart's innovative ab moves in this video were gentle and effective, helping me add some muscle to my mid section, muscle i sorely needed. This is a wonderfully fin and good video.",1126224000,,281,4.64
2268369,5,B00096S2SW,"I don not usually write reviews, but I really thought this was a GREAT and EFFECTIVE abs workout. The scarf was a very creative touch, it set the mood for a sexy routine, but it was deceptive in the sense that you don't realize how good of a workout you are about to get, it almost lulls you away, but then Leisa brings up the intensity and does a great job of explaining the moves and working the abs. I have toned up and feel sexy in bed, in the shower, whenever I see my ""almost six pack"" abs; I truly have defined my abs and it is incredible how good that makes me feel. I also do Leisa's SEXY LEGS video and brisk walking to help my cardio, but this abs video has really pushed me and made me feel great about my abs.",1125273600,2,722,3.986206896551724
2268370,5,B00096S2SW,"this is a really really good abs workout; i love the tone of the music, the intensity of the workout, leisa and the talent show all levels and modifications, it was easy for me, a beginner, and she showed ways to improve with intermediate and advanced poses, it was great, i know i can cahllenge myself and get stronger in a n area i have been weak for years....the set is sexy and cool, i like the whole feel of the dvd.",1124668800,,421,4.146341463414634
2268371,5,B00096S2SW,"i loved the sexy unique feel to this workout video, leisa hart is very good at explaining her moves and they effective toned my ab region in less than 4 weeks, i have definition in my abs that i could not achieve previously, and I FEEL SEXY, i feel great. I loved the non-traditional workout style, Hart is always producing different videos that at first might seem too different to somepeople, but they FLAT OUT WORK. I loved this and can't for her other new dvds!",1123372800,,465,4.4186046511627906
2268372,3,B00096S2SW,"From the outside of the DVD case, this looked like a great workout:  the box does a nice job of breaking down the workout, listing time durations for each chapter as well each bonus segment.  Unfortunately, I found that the actual workout did not live up to my expectations.

The main workout is about 34 minutes long and is broken into 4 segments.  The first, titled ""Sexy Sculpting,"" is 8 minutes long and completely misnamed--at best, this section stretched and warmed up the abdominal area, but there was certainly no sculpting effect.  Instructor Leisa Hart and her crew of 4 background exercisers sit in chairs and use scarves for the simple spine stretches, but I actually found it easier to forgo the prop.  The second segment, ""Hourglass Shaping,"" is a bit longer (10 minutes) but really not much more intense.  This time, the moves are performed on the floor, and the scarf is again used, mostly for leverage.  The moves are clearly Pilates-inspired--ie, you do a lot of c-curves with your spine--but they were not nearly as challenging as a true Pilates workout.

Performing the third segment, ""Belly Flattening,"" was the only time I could actually feel some work occurring in my abdominal area.  This section focused on the lower abs area with moves like reverse crunches and a version of the Pilates corkscrew.  However, as she does in the other videos of this series (ie, Sexy Legs), Leisa moves too quickly, making many of the exercises feel jerky and unnatural.  Furthermore, she does not fully explain the moves, and combined with poor camera angles, the workout is often hard to follow.  The final segment is called ""Back Strengthening,"" and I liked this one the least.  Here, the cast lies face down over a stool; although Leisa states that you could use a chair with a back, I did this and found it to be very awkward and uncomfortable.  This section included back stretching moves such cobra and plank; it probably would have been much more effective using a stability ball rather than a stool/chair.

The DVD bonus features included two additional workout segments, both 5 minutes long.  The first is ""Waistline Trimming,"" a series of oblique movements from a side-lying elbow plank position.  The second, ""Core Stretch,"" contains some nice yoga-like moves to stretch your midsection, although again, Leisa does not explain the movements very well.  Other DVD extras include a sneak peak of the class from a camera at the back of the stage, brief bios on Leisa and each of the four background exercisers, a music only workout option, and a photo gallery (why would I want to look at poses of Leisa in various outfits?).

Overall, this video was a disappointment.  I really enjoy abs work, including Pilates, and although this could have been a very good workout, it was just too poorly cued and cumbersome for my liking.  However, someone who does not enjoy more traditional abs work and who is looking for a more gentle workout focusing more on stretching than toning might find something to like in this video.",1122336000,15,3034,4.839147286821706
2268373,5,B00096S2SW,"IF YOU WANT TO GET SEXY ABS, AND LOOK SEXY LIKE LEISA HART, THEN BUY THIS VIDEO, IT IS ABSOLUTELY GREAT.

2268374,5,B00096S2SW,"leisa hart is my favorite instructor, she did it again with this very very good ab workout, i absolutely love it...the four routines are packed with great results, i can feel my abs getting the maximum toning i need....i can't wait to show off my new sexy abs, they are getting defined and i feel lean and toned",1120521600,,311,4.379310344827586
8057711,1,B00096S2SW,"I found this workout to be far too easy, I felt no burn in my abs at all.  I'm probably an intermediate to advanced exerciser.  The video cover says for all fitness levels but I can't even imagine a beginner being challenged by this.",1166054400,3,233,4.2727272727272725
8057712,5,B00096S2SW,"with a belly like mine, i wanted a fun and safe video to get started working on my abs, and this dvd is perfect...leisa hart is a great trainer, her boyd is incredible, and after having three babies, she has the body i want to achieve; now, it will take me several months if not a year, but its worth the effort, and her motivating style is what i need, not a boot camp instructor that is all fitness all day. i like being able to slowly get back into shape without all the pain of over doing it; my body has felt great for two months since i started doing this workout; its different from other ab routines, but if you listen to leisa hart and do the contractions right and breathe rite, you will feel it....I LOVE THIS DVD, and i think it is worth it!!!",1155600000,,755,4.108108108108108
8057713,1,B00096S2SW,"I was really excited to receive the Leisa Hart abs workout from amazon after reading all of the excellent reviews. To my disappointment this ab workout turned out to be terrible! I exercise daily and am getting my degree in physical fitness but I would say that I am intermediate to advanced. When I popped this dvd in my friend and I were ready to get a good abs workout, but neither of us even felt a burn! (My friend is a beginner..) I figured that maybe I was not doing the moves correctly but when I tried it again with an intermediate exercising buddy, we stopped halfway through and put in another dvd. I just don't understand how everyone else on Amazon is posting all of these good reviews! Please don't listen to them if you are used to doing ab workouts- try Shape's ""shape your abs"" or The firm ""jiggle free abs"" dvd's instead. By all means, do not waste your money on this one! This dvd is extremely easy, and if you want to lose weight or tone up, you need something more challenging!",1154649600,,998,4.342245989304812
