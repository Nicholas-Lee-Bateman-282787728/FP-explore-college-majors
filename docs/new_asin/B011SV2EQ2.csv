8725034,5,B011SV2EQ2,"Technique and Creativetraining is important in the modern soccer - if you understand that but don't know how to bring this into practice, here is your little helper! Matthias Nowak knows what he is talking about. His ideas or the ideas he brings up on this video are just great! I'm a fan of the cognitive enhancement approach. The tricks itself are not world first, but he encourages to be creative and build your own world first. If you are looking for something new or just a little bit of pepper to the salt of football, give it a try. You can find an appetizer of what this video is all about on youtube - just search for Matthias Nowak.",1471392000,2,642,4.358333333333333
