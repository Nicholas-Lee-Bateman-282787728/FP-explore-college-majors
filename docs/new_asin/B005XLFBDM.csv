4903314,4,B005XLFBDM,"Alright, just watched Bound for Glory and honestly it's a great improvement over the Bound for Glory's of the past.

Mexican America vs. Ink Inc (TNA Tag Title Match) (Pre-show) good match, has everything you need in a wrestling match, high-flying, wrestling, entertainment valve, spikey-hiared chicks headbutting wrestlers, this match is a good kick off. 3 out of 5.

Austin Aires vs. Brian Kendrick (X-Division Title Match) - I'm seeing a pattern now that BFG always starts with an awesome X-Division title match and this year was no exception. It was high-impact and hard hitting. Aires flies out of the ring I thought he was going to spear Kendrick through the guard rail. And there's so many hard hitting moments I just in awe at the punishment. 5 out of 5.

RVD vs. Jerry Lynn (Full Metal Mayhem) - I have to say when they wrestled at Destination X 2011 it was a good match but since it was a regularly sanctioned match I felt it was a little watered down, but this match lets all that stuff go. This match was awesome sauce! I thought I was flashing back to my favorite ECW classics in 1999, and there was also a ladder spot where RVD gets powerbombed onto the ladder (well the edge) that is just brutal to watch. Awesome match! Now that's the RVD vs. Lynn matches that I remember. 5 out of 5.

Samoa Joe vs. Matt Morgan vs. Crimson - Another hard-hitting match, kinda like the X-Division match, hard-hitting, high-risk, pretty cool. 4 out of 5.

Winter vs. Mickie James vs. Madison vs. Velvet Sky (Knockouts Title Match) - Boring. Karen Jarrett was the referee and most of the match is the girls yelling at her for not making a count. The only good spot in this match was Karen getting sprayed with Winter's red mist. But all in all boring. 1 out of 5.

Bully Ray vs. Mr. Anderson (Falls Count Anywhere) - Entertaining as hell. Dead end signs that just got clobbered off of Ray's head, fighting up the ramp, piledriver in the back, guard rails, tables, a fan throwing his drink at them (oh Philadelphia) it was awesome. Only sad part was Mr. Anderson over-shooting his Kenton bomb through the table, and instead just landed on the floor on his butt. That's the only bad spot, it brings me back to Lesnar's missed shooting star press at Wrestlemania 19. But despite that, great match! 4 out of 5.

AJ Styles vs. Christopher Daniels (I Quit Match) - Not the best between the two. This match seemed to be more of a ""match to get the storyline going"" type of match. 2 out of 5.

Hulk Hogan vs. Sting (Street Fight) - This match is pretty under-rated. Hogan did a lot more in this match than I thought he could even do with his back being worked on so much. And it was listed as a fight, it even said it on the dvd, so I didn't expect a wrestling classic. But yeah, brawling, bloody fighting, it works. And the implosion of Immortal worked great. I thought it was a good ending to the Immortal storyline (even though I think it's still kinda going on) but yeah good to watch. 4 out of 5.

Jeff Hardy & Jeff Jarrett also get into a confrontation that ends the same way a lot of them do. tons of security guards and TNA agents running down there to seperate them. Nothing new.

Kurt Angle vs. Bobby Roode (World Title) - Honestly this match was like a breath of fresh air, we get so much fighting throught this entire show that to see a straight up WRESTLING match was great to see. Great technical match. Roode lost the fall and got screwed but would only serve us to help his turn to heel. 5 out of 5.

And unlike the 2010 BFG dvd, this one brings the extras. 2 hours worth! It's got the Before the Bell special, normally these are between 10 minutes and 30 minutes, this one is 70 minutes! Along with 10 minutes of interviews and a fan interaction music video.

All in all it's definetly worth having. 2009 - Suckfest! 2010 - Good show but lags in extras. 2011 - A miracle! Great show and extras.",1327708800,3,3900,4.386426592797784
4903315,4,B005XLFBDM,"X Division Champion Austin Aries vs. Brian Kendrick - With Austin Aries history in Ring Of Honor wrestling that was based in Philadelphia for a time, Aries had the strong crowd support behind him.  Aries kept attempting a grounded head scissors but Kendrick was able to keep countering it while Aries was able to keep breaking Kendrick's momentum whenever it was starting to build but Kendrick was still able to deliver on moves like a tornado DDT that landed Aries right on top of his head.  Both men picked up the pace & went all out like Aries sandwiching Kendrick between himself & the guardrail when doing a suicide dive onto the outside, Kendrick doing Slice Bread on Aries that turned him inside out, and Aries delivering a brainbuster.  This was a very good match to start the show as both men were on their game here.

Full Metal Mayhem Match: Rob Van Dam vs. Jerry Lynn - For those who don't already know, Full Metal Mayhem is TNA's version of a T.L.C./Tables & Ladders & Chairs Match with this case being that you win the match by pinfall/submission instead of climbing a ladder & grabbing a hanging object.  Due to both men knowing each other so well, we kept having stalemates in the beginning of the match along with counters to signature moves like Lynn catching RVD with a dropkick in the middle of rolling thunder & later Lynn being able to get out of the way RVD's flip off the guardrail.  The weapons got involved as Lynn dropkicked the ladder in the ring in a way that it ended up hitting RVD's face on the floor, RVD doing a springboard crossbody on Lynn who landed on a chair followed by dropkicking Lynn in the corner with the chair & doing a rolling thunder onto a ladder with Lynn underneath, Lynn dropkicking the chair in RVD's face, RVD suplexing Lynn onto the ladder then nailing a springboard moonsault onto Lynn on the ladder, Lynn's flip powerbomb onto RVD on a ladder on the outside, and RVD's Van Daminator & Van Terminator using both a ladder & chair.  With both mens long history dating back to the original ""ECW"" based in Philadelphia in match where all these weapons where legal & encouraged to be used, you got the match you would expect with plenty of entertaining & sometimes scary spots.

Matt Morgan vs. Crimson vs. Samoa Joe - With Joe having issues with both of these men, he was the odd man out in this situation & targeted by both men.  Joe tried the divide & conquer strategy as he backdropped Crimson onto Morgan before delivering a suicide diving forearm with Morgan taking to the air himself with a flying crossbody off the top rope onto the outside.  Morgan & Crimson kept having miscommunications with Crimson trying to steal a pin at one point eventually causing them to turn on each other making it every man for himself but it was a case in the end of one man setting up Joe for the other man to come in behind & take the victory.  This was an average match that was more about furthering the tension between Morgan & Crimson but Joe was definitely the workhorse of this match.

Falls Count Anywhere Match: Mr. Anderson vs. Bully Ray - With Ray being another talent who made his name in Philly, be sure to watch the pre-match promo he did to ensure he wasn't cheered while Anderson was dead serious here as he didn't even do his usual ""mic drop"" entrance & ran straight to the ring.  Ray started off the match with some very impactful chops on Anderson's chest before he was able to regain control & did a classic ""Use My Sign"" gimmick before taking the brawl to the outside where Bully Ray suplexed Anderson on the stage before we had a exchange of words on Anderson's mic that resulted in Ray bleeding from it.  They went backstage where Anderson was dropped right on his head from a piledriver before moving through the crowd back into the ring with Anderson bringing the guardrail in with him as both men & Ray were on the giving & receiving end of punishment using that guardrail as tables were also setup on the outside & inside of the ring along with other weapons being used like a trash can.  This was a an entertaining hardcore match with the only thing bad about it was how the ending didn't go as planned causing Taz to say on commentary, ""Well, sometimes you have to call an audible.""

Knockouts Champion Winter vs. Mickie James vs. Velvet Sky vs. Madison Rayne w/Karen Jarrett as the referee - For those trivia fans, this is the second year in a row we had a fatal four way for the Knockouts Championship while continuing the tradition of matching a multi-woman match for the championship at every Bound For Glory.  This was one of those matches that was more about putting over storylines more than having a good match as the focus here was Karen Jarrett as she was heavily biased towards Madison, who had been sucking up to her for the past few weeks, while being against both Mickie & Velvet to the point where Karen refused to count for both women & told both Madison & Winter to go fight them instead of each other at one point.  We saw a situation happen that caused Traci Brooks to appear as Karen told her to only come if she was in harms way causing Velvet to capitalize & win the championship.  The match itself was nothing special but it's no big secret that TNA had been building up Velvet Sky as her own woman for the past year & this was the payoff for it.

""I Quit"" Match: A.J. Styles vs. Christopher Daniels - Styles came out with some new music before both men went right after each other with both men attempting to get the other to say ""I Quit"" with various submission holds before A.J. Styles got very frustrated with Daniels' smartass responses & tried to shove the microphone down his throat.  Daniels got out a toolbox from under the ring & threw a pike at A.J. on the floor before pulling out a screwdriver & tried to stab A.J. in the eye.  Daniels attention turned to A.J.'s back as he attempted a turn around slam on the apron but A.J. ended up hitting the ropes to crash & burn on the floor with Daniels following up with a B.M.E. on his back while A.J. was in a crawling position & a single leg boston crab.  The match got more personal as Daniels got on the microphone & continued to taunt A.J. even going as far as to mention A.J.'s wife & kids while choking him with a chair as A.J. was bleeding from the forehead.  Styles got his second wind after Daniels' comments & delivered a springboard off the ropes into a reverse DDT & went for the screwdriver to use on Daniels before he quickly quit & ran off only to later come back & attack A.J. on the stage.  Normally I say A.J. & Daniels have never had a bad match but this one was definitely different than all their other matches as they tried to push that this was more personal than any other battle but the finish just really came off bad & with the aftermath showing that nothing got solved here didn't help matters.

Right around here was Jeff Jarrett coming out to confront Jeff Hardy which lead to a huge brawl between the two before it was broken up by security...the same type of brawl we've seen for weeks on Impact after this PPV so in retrospect, this was only to get Hardy on the show & had no purpose past that.

Sting vs. Hulk Hogan - This match was for control of TNA as Hogan came out in his street clothes as he made it clear that he wasn't going to wrestle but instead fight Sting while Sting came out in his gear wearing a red & yellow ""Hulkamania"" shirt.  Dixie Carter was sitting in the front row while Hogan revealed that Ric Flair was going to be in his corner with the special twist being that the referee was ""Jackson James"" who was revealed earlier in the night to be Eric Bischoff's son Garrett.  Hogan kept overpowering Sting early while Flair got his shots in the floor whenever possible including both men hitting low blows on Sting.  Hogan used a weapon given to him by Flair to bust Sting open before Sting was able to fight off both men & use the weapon to make Hogan bleed before delivering Stinger Splashes to Hogan's bad back followed by the Scorpion Deathlock.  The aftermath here was the real story as we saw Immortal come out, the battle of the Bischoff's, and the REAL Hulk Hogan return.  he match was what you would expect knowing Hogan's condition but what happened with Hogan afterwords was suppose to come off as ""he saw the light"" but just the way it happened came off very flat.

TNA Champion Kurt Angle vs. Bobby Roode - Kurt came in with an injured groin resulting in his right thigh wrapped up.  Angle was able to stop the momentum Roode kept trying to build in the early moments which included Roode going for the crossface early but Angle was able to counter that with various german suplexes before Roode recovered & gave Angle a belly to back throw off the top rope that flipped Angle inside out.  They traded off various counters from the crossface into the anklelock into the AngleSlam into a victory roll with Roode heavily keeping up with Angle's wrestling & constantly being able to reverse holds into the crossface resorting to Angle resorting to dirty tactics.  Angle & Roode went out & put on a great wrestling match, not a classic, but a great wrestling match with the finish coming off as confusing as first until you saw the replays as the first camera angle didn't catch everything that happened.

Well as far as quality goes, this event was better than last years overall with the only things wrong being how the Knockouts match was more about further the storylines with Karen while the endings in the last 3 matches really didn't come off too well but there wasn't a bad match on here I would recommend watching the show as a majority of the matches were good quality.",1320364800,,9688,4.4377464788732395
4903316,4,B005XLFBDM,"It's TNA's signature event of the year, their Super Bowl, their World Series, it's Bound For Glory live from Philadelphia.

-We start with a video package showing the history of Hulk Hogan in TNA, as well as Kurt Angle vs. Robert Roode for the title tonight. Great way to hype the PPV up.

-X-Division Championship Match, Austin Aries (Champion) vs. Brian Kendrick: The crowd goes nuts for Aries as he comes out and we start with some good mat wrestling, Brian comes back with a hip toss and a dropkick and gets booed. Kendrick hits a nice splash to the outside, then Austin comes back working on the back of Brian and hits a big elbow for two. Austin goes for the pendulum elbow but gets rolled up for two and Kendrick comes back with a double axe handle to the back of the head for two. The crowd is very behind Aries as he hits three quick moves including an STO but only for two, then a great suicide dive to the outside into the guardrail. Huge sliced bread off the top by Brian but Austin gets his foot on the rope, then shortly after hits the Starstruck brainbuster and covers for 3. 8/10.

-Karen Jarrett is backstage upset at Traci Brooks for taking pics with Karen's kids, so Karen says she will be the referee in tonight's Knockouts match and that Traci can't step foot outside the locker room unless Karen is in danger.

-Full Metal Mayhem Match, Jerry Lynn vs. Rob Van Dam: There's the usual mat wrestling and countering since they know each other so well from their ECW days. After a botched crossbody by Lynn, a ladder gets brought into the action, as Lynn drills RVD slamming the ladder into his head. RVD hits the Van Daminator in the corner then hits Rolling Thunder onto a ladder and Lynn. Of course the crowd starts the ECW chants, Jerry misses a leg drop off the rope but hits the ladder, then throws a chair at RVD's head but only for two. RVD hits an asai moonsault on Lynn on a ladder for two, Lynn hits a big clothesline off the top then hits a sunset flip powerbomb to the outside and RVD's head hits the guardrail. RVD puts a ladder on Jerry in the corner then hits the Coast to Coast and makes the cover for 3. 7/10.

-Triple Threat Match, Samoa Joe vs. Crimson vs. Matt Morgan: Joe had targeted both men namely Crimson even taking away his shot at the TNA title a couple of months back. There's the expected double teaming on Joe which gets some boos from the crowd, then Joe hits a diving elbow suicide dive to the outside onto Crimson and Matt hits a big dive off the top rope to the outside. More action between the three and there's tension between Matt & Crimson and they finally come to blows, but Joe pulls Morgan out and slams him into the guardrail. Back in the ring Joe takes it to Crimson, Morgan misses the Carbon Footprint, Joe gets speared and Crimson covers to win. 6/10. The crowd wasn't behind Crimson at all and booed the finish.

-Bully Ray talks about how he is the meanest and the best in the wrestling business and he will prove it against Mr. Anderson tonight.

-Philadelphia Street Fight, Bully Ray vs. Mr. Anderson: It starts out fast and physical as Anderson hits a clothesline and a back suplex for two, Ray hits a big boot then hard chops in the corner. Anderson grabs a fans sign that turns out to be a Dead End street sign and cracks it over Ray's head, then on the outside some women keeps spilling her beer on Anderson which angers him. The action goes up the ramp to the entrance way, Ray hits a suplex on the stage for two, calls for Anderson's mike, but it gets cracked over Ray's head. Anderon grabs a section of guardrail and brings it into the ring but gets a clothesline and brings another table into the ring. Ray takes a backdrop on the guardrail, Anderson gets a Bubba Bomb through a table and kicks out. A Mic Check into the guardrail only geta a two, on the outside Anderson hits a Swanton onto Bully and a table but he misses, then hits a mic check into the table and Anderson wins. 9/10.

-Eric Bischoff is talking to referee Jackson James (aka Eric's real-life son) about how he must make sure Hogan wins and Sting is taken out.

-Fatal Four Way Match for the TNA Knockouts Championship, Winter (Champion) w/Angelina Love Velvet Sky vs. Madison Rayne vs. Mickie James, Special Guest Referee, Karen Jarrett: Given the friendship Madison and Karen had it was expected that she would sho favortism to her during the match. Winter locks on an arm bar on James, but Winter keeps pulling the hair. Rayne comes in, then Velvet hits a bulldog on her but Karen doesn't make the count. Karen wanted Mickie and Velvet in the ring, but wouldn't make the count for either, the crowd starts chanting boring, but Mickie hits a low dropkick then nails Madison off the ring apron. Both Winter and Rayne get taken down and beaten up by James and Velvet, Winter accidentaly sprays mist into Karen's face and Traci hits the ring (remember what Karen said earlier). Velvet hits a DDT on Madison, makes the cover and Traci counts to three, new champion. 6/10. Side note: I personally loved Winter's outfit, she looked great and it was also great to see Karen get what she deserved as she has never had any business being in wrestling at all.

-I Quit Match, A.J. Styles vs. Daniels: Years of friendship and recent tension finally comes to a head in the ultimate match to settle rivalries as one man tonight will have to say ""I Quit"". Both start out with some good wrestling, AJ hits a few stiff kicks to the back, then they trade submission moves including an abdominal stretch and a reverse bridging chin lock. Styles hits a nice dive to the outside, Daniels grabs a toolbox under the ring and tries to use a screwdriver on AJ's face, then hits a backdrop onto the ring apron and he works over AJ's back with a moonsault and a single leg boston crab. Daniels puts a chair on AJ's throat and cuts a mini-promo saying AJ's wife should take the kids out of the room, Styles comes back full of aggression hitting stiff clothesline and a hard forearm shot off the top rope. The Pele and the Styles Clash follow, then AJ grabs the screwdriver, goes towards Daniels, who grabs the microphone says he quits and runs away. 8/10. Would've been 10/10 but the finish was super weak. Daniels comes back out, attacks AJ on the ramp and hits the Angel's Wings then leaves.

-Jeff Jarrett's music hits and he doesn't look happy as he hits the ring. He cuts a promo on Jeff Hardy saying he doesn't want Jeff Hardy in TNA at all and that no one in the company wants anything to do with him. But he says that since he knows Hardy is in the building he is calling him out and his music hits as the ""Charismatic Enabler"" comes down to the ring. Hardy starts attacking Jarrett, clotheslines him then security comes in to break it up, both men break free at times to get in some more shots. This should've been saved for Impact as it wasn't very good.

-Sting vs. Hulk Hogan, If Sting wins Hogan will give back control of TNA to Dixie Carter: After nearly a year of build-up, we have this match, the crowd pops huge for Hulk who limps very awkwardly to the ring. Sting comes out in a Hulkamania shirt and gets a massive reaction from the crowd, the bell rings and Hogan can barely even move, then Ric Flair's music hits and the fans go nuts and it looks like Ric will be in Hulk's corner. Sting locks on a side headlock, then Hogan hits a shoulder block and poses, then locks on a sleeper hold. Hulk hits some very bad looking punches, Flair attacks Sting on the outside and Hogan grabs a foreign object and busts open Sting's head. Sting comes back, punching and knocking down Hulk,  then he chases Ric around the ring, grabs a spike, hits Hogan and now Hulk is bleeding. After two Stinger spalshes, he locks on the Scorpion, Hulk taps out and the ref calls for the bell. 3/10 for the match, 8/10 for the aftermath. Immortal hits the ring, lays out Sting then Bischoff hits his son (the ref) with a chair. Sting begs Hogan to help him and shockingly Hulk takes out members of Immortal, then Hogan and Sting clean house and Hulk hits Bischoff with a winding punch. Nice how the crowd kept chanting for Hogan and they both shake hands.

-TNA Heavyweight Championship Match, Kurt Angle (Champion) vs. Robert Roode: The crowd pops big for both men, Roode goes for the crossface early but Kurt makes it to the ropes. Angle then takes over with snap suplexes and the trademark three german suplexes but only for two, Roode hits a huge throw off the top that lands Kurt on the back of his head. Nice blockbuster type move off the second rope by Robert, but Angle comes back with a belly to belly suplex, then Angle keeps the pressure on him but can't keep Roode down for three, even after a big suplex/throw off the top rope. Roode locks on the crossface, but Angle reverses it into the ankle lock, Roode once again gets the crossface on, but Kurt won't tap, then hits the Angle Slam but only for two. He hits the Pay-Off perfect plex but only for two and the crowd is split, but Kurt hits a lowblow and another Angle Slam for two. Another crossface but Angle gets into the ropes, then Kurt hits a spear from two, Angle misses from the top, gets the crossface, but after an Angle Slam he covers Roode for 3 despite his arm being underneath the bottom rope. 8/10.

For this being TNA's biggest event of the year, it was a good one though the Sting/Hogan match was just sad to watch.",1319932800,,9407,4.395175186674325
4903317,4,B005XLFBDM,"The X Division championship match between Austin Aries & Brain Kendrick was the showstealer of the card. The Full Metal Mayhem match between Rob Van Dam & Jerry Lynn was a high-flying,hardcore good reminder of WWE's TLC matches from the Attitude era. The Samoa Joe-Matt Morgan-Crimson 3 way match was not great but pretty good. The Falls Count Anywhere match between Mr. Anderson & Bully Ray was a smash mouth,weapons filled brawl and a good reminder of Bully's days in ECW. The 4 way match for the Women's title(Velvet Sky vs Winter vs Mickie James vs Madison Rayne) had much better wrestling then last year's 4 way match and Velvet's win was not a fluke. The ""I Quit"" match between AJ Sytles & Christopher Daniels was a back-and-forth,high-flying & smash mouth bout even with Christopher Daniels quitting so easily in the end. The Sting-Hulk Hogan match had so-so wrestling/brawling but had first-rate raw emotion. The post match brawl between Sting against Immortal with Hulk Hogan turning face and on his gang by helping Sting was the highlight of the card. The World Heavyweight championship match between Kurt Angle & Bobby Roode was a back-and-forth,high-tech,smash mouth match even the flat finish of Kurt grabbing the ropes to win while Roode's arm was under the ropes the whole time.
