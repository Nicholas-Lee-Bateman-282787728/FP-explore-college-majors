3882215,5,B0029XZODO,"We all know good and well that the prices on Amazon fluctuate frequently. You just have to watch and wait for the best deal. Therefore your review should not be based on the price because that just makes it look bad and makes the star ratings pointless if they are all about price. For the record I got this from Amazon and not a seller for 53.99. The day after I ordered it, it was back up to 67. Point proven. Otherwise I will go ahead and rate the product. I love this show, it's amazing. The set is only the individual season sets packaged together, but it's still great. They are actual boxes, none of the cardboard slide in and out cases or anything else. I know it's not a Fox dvd set, but if you have ever bought any of those the boxes are like that. Examples would be Buffy, Angel, or Prison Break. I always like to know those types of things. I would definitely recommend this product to fellow Dexter lovers!",1252886400,39,919,4.257142857142857
3882216,5,B0029XZODO,"Dexter is a show on Showtime about Dexter Morgan, a Forensic Blood-Spatter spealist with the Miami PD.  He's also has a very dark secret.. that he is a serial killer.. and he works for the police, a perfect cover!

---Without spoiling anything plot related here is a quick synopsis for anyone looking for a good reason to watch this.---

  An adopted child from a young age, Dexter and his sister grew up with their loving foster father, who also happened to be an accomplished detective.  His father, being a cop and all, sensed something different about Dexter, his desire to hurt things, small animals, ect, his detachment from the world, and lack of emotion toward anything.  A smart detective, he recognized this for it was, that his son was heading down the road of a murderer.  He does what any loving father would do of course... teach his son everything he knows, and how to get away with it.  Realizing that Dexter's path would lead him only to the electric chair, he can't bear to see his son die in this way.  So he give him a 'code' with which to kill by.  To only go after the scum of the earth.  The murderers, the rapists, the child molestors, the one's that slip through the cracks of a flawed 'justice system'.  This code Dexter strives to live by, it feeds his insatiable desire to kill, and honors his father's wishes.

  Dexter is a fantastic show that twists your perception of morality, and begs questions of your mind like, can you like this person?  Very well written, with convincing narrative and great acting from a nobody cast that you come to know well helps its case.  Be aware that this show is run on Showtime, and therefore is not bound by the heavy censoring of regular cable television.  (Even though cable censors are joke nowadays)  There will be no shortage of gratuitious use of blood, killing and violence.  There is also a hefty bit of nudity and sexual content, with some F bombs here and there (mostly from one character).  If any of these things offend you, you have been warned.  Withstanding those things, nothing should deter you from seeing this entire series, as each season is very well done, and all are worth a five-star rating.

Hope this helps you if you were on the fence.  :)",1252022400,30,2232,4.561712846347607
3882217,5,B0029XZODO,"I finally took advantage of getting what I pay for with my cable company. Prior to Season 3 of Dexter, I watched the first two seasons on DVD (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Season-One/dp/B000Q6GUW0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Season One</a>&nbsp;&<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Season-Two/dp/B000V86OKG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Season Two</a>). I used to send all this money to my cable company for subscribing to Showtime, and Dexter was never part of my regular TV viewing until 2008. Color me stupid. What was I missing out on?...Only the absolute best show on TV.

How good is it? Let's put it this way...I'm actually glad that I hadn't seen this until DVD, because my wife and I were able to watch the first two seasons in weeks versus like 3 months PER regular season on Showtime. We often watched three episodes in one night on the DVD sets. Alas, I couldn't wait for Season 3's release on DVD, so it was one episode of Dexter, one week at a time for Season 3.

So certainly one of the good things about Dexter on DVD is that you don't need to wait 12 weeks to see a season from start to finish. But certainly the best thing about the series is how well done it is.

Dexter (played by Michael C. Hall of HBO's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Six-Feet-Under/dp/B000HEVZBW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Six Feet Under</a>&nbsp;fame) is a blood spatter analyst with Miami Homicide. It's his job to help solve murders, and he also happens to moonlight as a serial killer....Just a side note that last part.

The acting in the show is terrific, and the thrills and twists are plentiful. Combine the nature of Dexter's professional life with his favorite pass-time, and you can bet your carotid artery that there's plenty of blood in the show too. But rest assured that the show isn't just about killing. Relationships, family, the inner working of a homicide squad...all of this ""stuff"" is also packed neatly into the Dexter series and makes the show one of the best on TV that I've seen in a long long time.

The major plot involving guest star Jimmy Smits in Season 3 is a bit more of a stretch of reality than were Season's 1 & 2. But the acting, dialogue and well-written story flow kept the show right up there at the top of my list of TV's finest.

Add this bloody-good show to your cart. I'd strongly urge newcomers to start from Season 1. I dare you to just try watching Season 1 and then not go for Seasons 2 and 3; I simply don't believe that anyone could possibly do that.

Side note: At the time of the original writing of this review it was cheaper to buy the first three seasons on Blu Ray individually than paying the price for this package of the first three seasons, but then a few days later it was cheaper to buy this package. So check that before you click on add to cart.",1244419200,23,2914,4.983539094650205

3882224,5,B0029XZODO,"Dexter is one hell of a TV series, no doubt about. Brilliant acting, very good scripts that are based on Jeff Lindsay's Dexter novel and a lot of dark humour.

This box set offer is quite cool. When I ordered this set, it was offered at a reduced price. So I got a lot more for less. At this point I like to thank the guys at amazon for being very generous shipping this set again for the same price, because it was shipped back due to a failure in the post service in Germany. And, yes, this time the shipment arrived. Now I can enjoy one of my favourite series on Blu-ray. Thanks!",1292544000,,582,4.105263157894737
3882225,5,B0029XZODO,"As someone who appreciates intelligent story telling and people who are introverted I can appreciate Dexter on many levels. While Dexter's struggle about how to interact with those around him in any given situation is a bit to the extreme and very self-aware so that we the viewer can ride-along with Dexter, it's not so different than the struggle that many people have in trying to relate to others and fit in. Dexter's internal voice is the one we all have subconsciously have mulling around just below the surface. It's the voice we all share even though we're not driven to kill or infatuated with death in the same way Dexter is and as such, Dexter's a character who resonates with most people in many ways.

As for the show itself, Dexter's very well written and plotted out. The stories told unfold piece by piece, thus building the suspense and surprise when some new twist to the story is introduced and usually leaves your jaw on the floor. There are elements of everything in Dexter's stories from suspense, mystery and a bit of horror to humor (usually of the dark variety), action and some great dialog. The characters are mostly believable though initially a few of the characters are a bit one-note. However, as the show progresses, so to do the characters and the cast ends up being very strong if not a bit small at times.

This show probably isn't for those people affected by violence strongly as it does contain some fairly intense and graphic stuff from time to time (though certainly not over the top or gratuitous. It is an intense study into human nature and in a time when most of the airwaves are filled with vacuous tripe like Jersey Shore, WWE and all the silly ""reality"" TV shows, it's a real blessing to have thoughtful, intelligent scripted drama even if it can be a bit dark at times.",1290038400,,1817,4.622291021671827
3882226,5,B0029XZODO,"Dexter is a show like no other.  This is a cop who goes around killing the bad guys in the most gruesome of ways and yet you can't really hate him for it; actually he's most likely cheered on. Those he kills are the bad guys; the filth of the earth; the killers, the rapists and the like.  He got married last season and has two step-kids.  Now this is not the best example of a good dad but somehow he makes it work.

It is awe-inspiring to watch him weave his tales (have to work late; etc etc) and nobody has caught him yet.  I have all the episodes except the latest one (what the hell is wrong with these distributors -- come on--let's get these prices down down down!).  Last season he floored his audience by killing someone (as far as I can remember) who wasn't suspect--well maybe a little.

 There are a few known stars that trickle in and out of the show  but the bottom line is.........good bye and good riddance to the bad asses of the earth. Dexter is a sort of superman, batman, and superchick (I just made that one up) all in one--however, he can't fly.....to bad....that would be even more interesting.

This is not a show for kids - too gory and may give them ideas but for the adults (don't be a prude) it is a ride you'll not soon forget.
 I'm waiting for the last series to come down to a decent price and can't wait to get my hands on it.

Dexter is delicious!!

3882227,1,B0029XZODO,"Oh no, I can't believe this series made it past the first season. Its such a pointless and stupid show with a morbid and really meaningless storyline, and a freak-show main character who reminds me of a weaker rip off of actually good dark super heros. What were they thinking, when they made this garbage. Here's some advice set this box set on fire and watch some decent tv like House, Rescue Me, or Man Vs Wild.

So many bad guys even cops can't find all of them. Well Dexter is watching for those guys who don't get caught for whatever reason. Like a murderer he waits for his victims when they least expect.

3882234,5,B0029XZODO,"I had seen these seasons a few years back on Showtime, I felt that is was such a good series that I had to get it on DVD. Looking at the seasons for a second time did not spoil it for me. It was just as entertaining as the first time especially looking at it with someone who had not seen it before. 5 stars!!!!",1286928000,,311,3.8
3882235,5,B0029XZODO,"DEXTER is one of those rare dramas that started with a bang from the get go and has only gotten better with each season.  I purchased this set of the first three seasons and watched all 36 episodes over a matter of two weeks.  It honestly takes only the pilot episode for the show to strongly establish the story line, introduce all the characters as fully developed people and even start a strong plot line.  Of course what holds the show together is Dexter himself.  If this show hadn't been handled so perfectly it could have easily crossed many lines of taste and morals.  But instead it is written, directed, acted and produced with intense loving care and intelligence.

We have Dexter Morgan who is a blood splatter analyst for the Miami Metro Police Department.  He was orphaned at an early age and brought intro a cops family where he quickly formed a strong bond with his sister Debra as well as Harry, his adoptive father.  Dexter saw much bad as an infant and his father notices his tendencies that aren't fully human.  Dexter cannot feel emotions and doesn't understand the difference between right and wrong.  He also has a strong desire to kill.  His father Harry teaches him a code to live and  also to kill by when he must.  He teaches him how to fake emotions and how to behave to appear as belonging in normal society.  Michael C. Hall embodies the adult Dexter fully.  He had a strong character on a previous series SIX FEET UNDER but all that is forgotten with his tour de force performance on DEXTER.  The show is seen through the eyes of Dexter.  His voice over tells us all Dexter is experiencing as the plotlines develop.  We have here a serial killer who only kills people who deserve to die - the serial killers and murderers in society.  For the writers and Michael C. Hall to get the audience to root for a serial killer is a great feat.

The first season is amazing and concerns the search for the Ice Truck Killer.  The season runs strong and the finale is amazing - so amazing that season two seemed to start a little slow.  But leave it to DEXTER.  The writers were only continuing the story as necessary to keep everything believable.  And with the blink of an eye season two becomes amazing as well as we now have the Bay Harbor Butcher.  Season three was the first to introduce a guest star throughout the season and we have Jimmy Smits as Miami DA Miguel Prado.  He and Dexter become friends which is a new and confusing thing for Dexter.  Miguel also becomes a sort of apprentice and things get out of control.  In season four John Lithgow appears as The Trinity Killer and DEXTER raises the bar in all areas and it becomes the best season thus far.

All characters are believable and acting superb.  Introduced in the first season is troubled soul Rita, a woman with whom Dexter can find some peace.  Her presence other than Debra is the only calming influence for Dexter.  Many tv series have been put on blu ray and it is only a gimmick to take advantage of the new media.  Often picture and audio is lacking and honestly not much better than the dvd option.  DEXTER is the definite exception.  Taking place in Miami there are many beautiful outside shots of sea, sky and beautiful scenery.  It is all crisp and clear.  Facial tones are impeccable and everything about the blu ray video transfer is first rate.  Seeing the close ups and the crispness and ratio of colors and great definition between black/white colors will have the viewer amazed.  And the audio is also heads above the dvd and tv digital options.  The series opening segment begins each episode with strong bass and vibrant sound.  Dialogue is crisp and over it all Dexter's voice over is strong and prominent. It is as if the viewer is in his mind.  And the music is so much more noticable.  When the killings happen all speakers are put to scary use.  The show is more of a front speaker driven show with home theater systems and it is utilized well.  Also when needed the rear speakers come to life full force.  Audio is definitely superb.

DEXTER only gets better with each season.  With a great cast, superb writing and the amazing presence of Michael C. Hall as Dexter the show is the most innovative, risk taking and simply the best on tv.  When will Michael C. Hall finally get his well deserved Emmy?  And finally, all the seasons on blu ray come highly recommended.  It ups the ante on the show in every way and shows just how great blu ray can be.",1286668800,,4467,4.48014888337469

3882245,5,B0029XZODO,"After watching almost two seasons of the show so far, I've been very impressed by how well this series has conducted itself. It is a fantastic show, and very very well done.

Although there are some slight problems with it; the humanization of the title character seems a bit off, and the show seems to be becoming ever more ""standardized"". The start of a season has been so far very cryptic, but seems to rush towards the ending quickly during last few shows at an accelerated pace. Some of the situations don't make a lot of sense, and things don't always fit. For example, creating confusion in a group oflaw enforcement people might make your intuition say ""law enforcement background"", but it's just as likely a schemer, psychiatrist, spy, or the like. Law enforcement? How about military intelligence, KGB, or CIA.

So there is the occasional obvious plot device here and there. Such as expecting that rather than killing a hostage, or ruining their life through a frame up, that they'd get killed accidentally though no fault of the anti-hero. Regardless if that's true or not, there are many instances where something like that is true. Knocked somebody out and shot them up with drugs? Why would someone else not be concerned about the action itself, but rather ignore that and believe the only reason somebody knows how to do that is because they use those drugs themselves, even though there's no physical evidence at all that they do.

The series contains random sporadic semi-nudity. Buttocks here and there. Jumping between glimpses of, to long obvious shots flaunting, breasts; there seems to be no middle ground. Aside from fairly clear efforts to not show full frontal nudity, which is typical and rather expected, there is what appears a rather glaring exception to this sporadic semi-nudity (full back, top front, bottom front hidden by items or legs). The foul-mouthed woman that was originally working undercover vice (with all that entails conceptually) is annoyingly and obviously hidden from our view. It's plain what they're doing. The first example even has what appears to be the actress wearing some sort of covering on her chest, even though elaborate pains are taken to not show anything in the first place anyway. It can't be explained simply by the actress being TUT, as one of the first examples of a topless female (in a hospital bed a few shows in to the series) is of a similar nature.

The point of all this is not trying to complain about this actress not wanting to do any shots with herself topless. As far as we know, she's had twin mastectomy operations, or has strongly held religious convictions that don't extend to her dialog. The point being that the sheer blatant ""actively not showing anything"" detracts from the flow of the show; like they're purposely drawing your suspension of disbelief away to focus on this.

Otherwise, this show is just about as perfect as can be expected of anything.  Highly recommended.  I can't wait to watch the 3rd season!",1282089600,,3001,4.849609375
3882246,4,B0029XZODO,"Dexter is an amazing show. I have not bought this particular set, so I am not reviewing the quality of the box, or the title screen or anything, but the show itself is so great! I have never wanted a serial killer to get away with it so badly. It is a completely unique show in the way it is filmed and the way you get to know each character, really makes you think about human nature. It is definitely one of my top 5 shows, so why did I give it 4 stars?... intimate scenes, I could totally do without the naked, sweaty, sex scenes. Whatever happened to the shows where they were about to kiss and then the scene changes to after ""the act"" and shows them putting their shirts back on? you know what happened... I don't have to see it... anyways that is just my two cents. Other than that it is a great show, I just feel dirty telling people it is my favorite show without explaining that I fast-forward through the sexy parts. but I supposed that is why you should buy it on disk instead of watching it on tv, you can just skip what you DON'T wanna see and for all you teenage boys, I suppose you can rewind and rewatch what you DO want to see haha.

Dexter's frequent struggles to appear empathetic seem to be right on the money. As a Correctional Officer, I deal with this type of personality on a regular basis.

3882259,5,B0029XZODO,"How does one convince others that a television series, (network, cable, or otherwise), is worthwhile viewing. You can't. It's impossible, since viewer tastes vary and are generally dictated by personal preference, genre, even instilled moral up-bringing.

Many opposed this shows' initial airing without seeing a single episode, deeming it inappropriate for public broadcast after reading some early reviews regarding its' content. With that in mind, I watched (keeping a non-biased equilibrium), and personally found the berated show to be quite the contrary.

Dexter is well-produced, incorporating an immaculate cast, great story arcs, dialogue, and camera work that actually surpasses most traditional ""cop investigation"" offerings currently loved and watched by millions. In my opinion, Dexter is one of the best productions available on the tube... complete with all the drama, suspense, and story twists we expect from modern day television writers, and more! Its' theme song alone is so distinctive, you don't even need to be in the same room to hear it and know what program is on.

We're talking about a momentum-induced series, ready to begin its' 6th season. They are obviously doing something right at the studio to maintain a continued contract. Regardless of the subject matter (cop code vs. serial killer code), this is SO well-made that most viewers I queried said they were hooked after the premiere episode. I was as well. It wasn't what I expected at all, and I misjudged it prematurely. My bad! Dexter now ranks among my favorites. Can't wait for the next season to begin.

This is a super package deal for Seasons 1-3. I highly recommend it to Dexter fans and curious buyers alike. Naturally, Amazon prices fluctuate regularly, so just be patient and check for best value. Purchased it myself when it was released, and worth every penny. Happy shopping!",1268956800,2,1875,5.219269102990033

3882273,5,B0029XZODO,"It is about time that television has come around to the reality that there are many truly messed up people out in the world. Dexter is a classic example of how a person can be extremely evil and good at the same time. There are so many different aspects to every person and yet they hide away what makes them what they are. Dexter shows that even in the neighbor you have come to trust there could be a true monster lurking under the surface. Some of the scenes in the series are harsh, but true to the nature of the show. All the character in the show are believable and that is probably the thing that is the most disturbing, for they could be people you would run into in your every day life. Some of the twist in the show are close to being genius.

You are going to want to see the show from the beginning and watch every episode with an open mind. the plot of the story has little clues strung out throughout the show and if you are not paying attention to what is going on then you are going to be surprised when events seemingly come crashing down.

Being a true Horror fan this is one show I recommend to every friend I have.",1264896000,,1134,4.126696832579186

3882282,5,B0029XZODO,"If I could find the writers of this show I would shake their hands and maybe even throw in a hug.  I avoided this series because the story sounded like it had been done many times before...I couldn't have been more wrong!  I started with the first episode streaming on netflix and found it to be kinda interesting.  I had to watch the next episode, this continued through the the entire first season, where I decided to order 1-3 on Blu Ray.

This is easily one of the best tv shows I've ever seen.  I would rank it better than Lost, Sopranos, and Prison Break (some of my previous all time favorites) The characters are spot on, and Michael C. Hall is absolutely fantastic, hes so quite and dark but at the same times make you laugh (especially when he makes cocky remarks in his head).  I'd have to say this show is like a combo of CSI, Law and Order, and your favorite Hollywood serial killer flick.

I don't wanna ruin any story details, or twists and turns...but let me say they are all over, and each one will have your nose to the screen waiting for the outcome of each.  If you haven't seen Dexter yet, definitely pick it up and watch it, its one of those seasons you can start all over from the beginning and watch all over.

Now onto the Blu Ray disc details.  As I said I started watching on streaming Netflix, which wasn't HD and only used stereo sound.  The Blu Rays are a huge step up, the 5.1 is awesome, and surrounds you in the story even more.  The picture is also very impressive bringing Miami to life.  This is important because alot of the areas used in the show include restaurants, nightclubs, and lots of outdoor scenery.  Colors are very sharp, blacks are nice and inky, and whites don't washout...for the most part.  I did find a few spots in Season 3 that got a bit pixelated in a few parts (mostly dark scenes) This however is in no way a deal breaker, and to be honest this show could be on VHS, with mono sound and still be a thrill ride that you don't want to walk away from!

If you decide to start this series do yourself a favor and set away some time...your gonna need it, after the first and second episode, you won't wanna stop, this really is an A+ TV series.",1263686400,2,2198,4.260240963855422

And in my view, the price was right, considering it got me an entire three seasons of one of the best shows out there.

Anyway, the 1st episode of season 1 the screen keep going blue but the sound was fine. Not sure what that meant but paused the show and waited about a minute and it came back fine. This happened about 5 or 6 times during the 1st episode. During the 2nd episode, it just flashed blue without actually stopping the visual part. This happened about 4 times. I was very careful to make sure that the DVDs were able to be played in NZ as Amazon ask this several times during the transaction, so Im not sure if this is a fault with the DVD or our player.

3882291,5,B0029XZODO,"For those of us who have been watching DEXTER since its premiere season, this collection of all three seasons is a treat - a reminder of how some of the aspects of this strangely lovable 'serial killer' who only kills (most of the time!) criminals who slip through the cracks of justice came to be.  The series is well written and manages to continue to open up hints dropped in the first season in the just-completed third season.  We now are more fully informed of Dexter's childhood incidents that pushed him into the strange state of existence he now lives  - a married man with family - the fact  which modifies the way he approaches his inner darkness to stalk and destroy evil people.  Characters throughout the show are more credible, the various subplots continue to be developed well - facts that now make Dexter seem more a part of his job as a forensics specialist in a Miami police unit that has many interesting variations of normal police behavior.  Adding such guest stars as Jimmy Smits and John Lithgow raises the show to a different level: the show is now an ongoing story instead of weekly dipping into death.  Who knows how the series will continue to develop, but if the writing and acting continue on this level, season four can only be terrific. Who will they invite into this strange but fascinating atmosphere next?  Grady Harp, December 09",1260921600,,1366,4.6625

Each season starts off slowly; the early episodes are a bit slow-moving, but by the third episode, one is totally engaged and chomping at the bit for more.

Dexter can Fabricate Evidence Destroy Evidence change things around Dexter is the Bay Harbor Butcher and Miami Metro doesn't even realize it now if you ask me that's pretty cool I love how the writers made this show so Excellent and I can see that Dexter's father Harry Morgan did an Excellent Job raising him Dexter's sister Debra Morgan is also a fine Character of this show I mean she's brilliant at first the lieutenant has it out for her but that changes as the series progresses and later on the lieutenant starts to like her more than she did before and things start to get a lot better and easier for her after all her brother is the Bay Harbor Butcher and they never find this out at all but his luck has to run out sometime which is true because everybody's luck runs out eventually Dexter is going to get caught for everything he's done because no Serial Killer gets away with the things that he does to people for long it Just doesn't happen at all eventually that person is going to get caught for all the things he's done and when he does he's going to Prison for a long long time if not for life I highly recommend Dexter seasons 1-3 as I'll be buying season four when it's ready to be released because I absolutely love this show Dexter. I hope you found my review very helpful and detailed enough!,1255219200,,1503,4.277192982456141

3882307,5,B0029XZODO,"Yes yes, a review should be based on the product, not the price so sure, yes, Dexter is a GREAT show - I recommend it highly and this is coming from someone who never gets addicted to a show.  I got addicted to this.  Some of the best tv america's seen yet.

Ok, so that being said: DONT BUY THIS THROUGH AMAZON... as others have mentioned their price on this seems to change hourly.  if you have itunes (and you should!) buy it there.  it's only 99 cents an episode.  that's 11.88 per season - so around 36 bucks for seasons 1-3.  not 50, not 122, not 80, -- THIRTY SIX bucks.  totally reasonable.  plus doing it the itunes way is ""greener"" b/c no plastic discs and packaging have to be made... and thrown away once you've worn them out from watching this great show time and time again.  enjoy!",1253318400,,796,4.246666666666667
