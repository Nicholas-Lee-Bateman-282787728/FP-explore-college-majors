The first two focused on the western front but this one focuses on the eastern front.  The time period covered is, after a short introduction (Battle of the Bulge, Warsaw August 1944 uprising), from mid January 1945 (Soviet offensive across the Vistula in central Poland) to the end of WWII in Europe in early May 1945.

It is a decent summary of those last battles in the east and of surrounding events, such as:
-the German Baltic convoys, first to supply East Prussia, then to evacuate soldiers and civilians starting on 20 January (""greatest evacuation in history...850,000 troops and civilians""),
-the sinking of the Gustlav on 30 January when 5,300 to 7,000 drowned,
-the firestorm bombing of Dresden on 13/14 February (3,370 tons dropped by British, 770 tons dropped by US, 25 to 35,000 incinerated).
-the early March 1945 German counterattack at Lauban (near Goerlitz in Silesia), made somewhat famous by the newsreel showing Goebbels congratulating a 16 year old HJ kid (Willi Huebner) having been awarded the Iron Cross 2nd class.
-the Yalta conference.
-the fortress cities:Poznan, Breslau, Danzig, Koenigsberg,....

There is an absolutely ridiculous error when the documentary states that Zhukov brought in 16,000 antiaircraft searchlights to blind the German defenders of the Seelow Heights.  There were only a few hundred, 1% of what the documentary claims.  Specifically, Anthony Beevor puts the number at 143 on p 219 of his&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fall-of-Berlin-1945/dp/0142002801/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fall of Berlin 1945</a>.

The famous film of the review of courageous HJ kids by Hitler in the Reichskanzlei garden is included.  The date is given as March 20 1945.  Other, more reliable, sources date this event to 20 April 1945 (Hitler's 56th birthday).  See for example:

Since theaters were closed by Goebbels in March 1945 and propaganda movies were no longer produced after that, it casts a doubt about the actual date of that video recording.  Maybe it was shot on 20 April but was never shown to the German public.  A minor mystery...",1342656000,,4268,8.109207708779444
