7847418,4,6303424783,i like this vhs...i collect submariner items. th e clam shell is cool..but the reason i gave it 4 stars..is because it has two tales on here..one from the 1966 sub mariner series..and amazing spider man with guest star the sub mariner.. i rather have another submariner story..but hey i don't work at marvel....its a shame it its so short running time. but hey i will slowly get the submariner cartoons slowly one at a time until the  full series is for purchase on dvd. but hey if you love cartoons its worth the price for ya collection.,1427500800,,538,4.489795918367347
