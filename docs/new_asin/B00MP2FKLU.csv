6597860,3,B00MP2FKLU,"Note: This is for the third movie only, ""Predators'.  My review here might be considered a bit of a spoiler....I always love to watch the Predator movies. I've always been a bit skeptical when it comes to sequels, for any movie series. In this trio set, there is the 'Predators' movie. I had not seen it before. Now that I have, I wish I hadn't. At the same though, I'm glad I won't be wondering if I could've missed a good movie. In many scenes, it gave a more of a 'matter of fact' feel. The characters(humans) that were transplanted from Earth to the Predator's planet, very quickly figured out where they were, and why, without much of an OMG! They basically looked at each other and decided this is the way it is, now we just need to survive. It quickly lost it's 'mystery' and my attention. I did finish watching it, but was still sorely disappointed. If you are a 'loyal diehard' Predator fan, this Part 3 will probably be disappointing for you also. But for those that have never seen these, they might be a good set to own.",1521590400,,1032,4.375

I put the ""Predator 2"" disc in my X-box one, saw the FBI warning, then the screen went black and nothing happened. When I used my controller to look at the blu ray menu, it showed the movie time as 0:00/0.00 which means there is no data on this disc. I'm thinking there was a problem with the disc production and they sent out a bunch of blank ""Predator 2"" blu rays with this package. The other two movies worked great. I sent the product back to Amazon and received a replacement. The same thing is currently happening with the ""Predator 2"" disc. I will submit a complaint with Amazon but I'm thinking I might just have to live with being not fully satisfied with this product. Buyer beware.",1507680000,9,784,4.304054054054054

Very easy to recognize the technological advances in make-up, animation, etc that have occurred since 1987.

6597920,4,B00MP2FKLU,"If you like the movies or would like to buy them just to own the price is good and the DVD set is fine.  I personally am not a huge fan of these movies for some reason.  I really want to like them and in theory I tell myself I like them and I think predator looks awesome, but the movies are a bit of a letdown.  I particularly don't like the 2nd movie probably because it was just lame.  Some parts were alright but I just wasn't feeling it maybe because of the urban setting.  Predators(3rd movie) was pretty cool and I enjoyed it more than the 2nd but the game preserve thing was kinda dumb to me cause even though they are hunters it always seemed to me there was a degree of pride in defeating their enemies on their own turf but it was a more entertaining and enjoyable than the 2nd.  The best movie was the original and would have been better had they cut out the typical 80s action movie corny catch phrases.  The characters were the best, the setting was the best, and the story was the best and most believable.",1492041600,,1021,4.152284263959391

6597923,4,B00MP2FKLU,"What's Included: Predator 1 (Ultimate Hunter Edition); Predator 2; and Predators

Though most fans of the series would likely disagree, Predator 2 is my favorite of the group. I think it's criminally underrated. The concept of the Predator hunting big game in a semi-dystopian 1997 Los Angeles was always great juxtaposition to 'hunting in the jungle.' I appreciate the film more today (20 years later) for seeing how comical and backward the depiction of the city turned out to be.  The Predator's personality/morality nuances were always memorable. And let's face it, given that it was the second time around, the Predator costume(s) and designs were much improved.

The P1 UHE has all the special features and touches, e.g. a special menu displayed when the movie is paused. I suspect the studio had overstock and decided to bundle the extra discs w/ P2 and P3. P2 has featurettes and the like, but none of the extra loving care of P1 UHE. I haven't gotten around to watching P3 yet, because, well, honestly I didn't think much of it when I saw it in the theater -- I'm sure it will be great, though.",1490400000,13,1103,4.734375

6597969,4,B00MP2FKLU,"The Predator is one of the most intimidating aliens in the world of sci-fi -- a hulking, technologically superior big-game hunter who likes to take the skins of their victims. And the ""Predator Triple Feature"" is a solid way of being introduced and acquainted with the three movies that focus on these creatures -- expect lots of blood, dismemberment, and three very different environments where humans must outthink and outmaneuver alien threats.

""Predator"" features Major Alan ""Dutch"" Schaefer (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and his team heading out into the jungle to rescue an official held by insurgents. But when they get to the jungle, they find that something horrible is amiss -- the bodies of three Special Forces agents have been skinned and left hanging in the jungle, and it turns out to not be the work of the insurgents. Instead, an invisible force is stalking them through the jungle, picking off the commandos one by one -- and unless Dutch can figure out a way to outwit it, he'll be the final prize it takes.

""Predator 2"" takes us to the mean streets of 1990-era Los Angeles, during a sweltering heat wave and a small war between Jamaican and Columbian drug cartels. As the cops try to quell the violence, LAPD officer Harrison (Danny Glover) finds that the drug lords and their followers are being horribly killed by a mysterious assassin -- and as the Predator cuts a bloody swathe through Los Angeles, Harrison finds that a shadowy government agency is also following the alien.

""Predators"" sees several mercenaries, murderers, assassins and soldiers being parachuted into a remote jungle, full of human corpses, strange beasts and booby traps. Royce (Adrien Brody) quickly realizes that something is strange about this place, and soon they find that they're actually on an alien moon -- a hunting preserve where abducted predators are turned into prey for the Predators. And as the humans band together to try to stay alive, they find that the aliens pursuing them are also hunting their own kind.

Not counting the rancid stains known as the ""Alien Vs. Predator"" movies, the Predator trilogy is probably the most solid movie trilogy that isn't one continuing story. In fact, it works to the movie's advantage that -- except for the titular aliens -- there are no recurring characters who tie the different stories together, allowing the general feeling that these aliens can turn up in ANY hot, steamy environment, prowling in search of violent, well-trained individuals to hunt down.

And in fact, each movie has a distinct way of presenting itself -- ""Predator"" is a lean, small-scale thriller that relies on the primal, slightly feverish atmosphere of the jungle, while the sequel went for a ""concrete jungle"" full of shadowy nooks and grimy smoggy streets, and a much larger cast of characters for the Predator to pick-and-choose from. And while ""Predators"" is often regarded as derivative of the first movie, since it also takes place in a forested area, it's actually rather different -- the temperate alien setting gives it a nightmarishly remote quality, and the cast is made up of suspicious murderers and soldiers rather than a tight-knit team of commandos.

It also benefits from some rather good performances by the various lead actors -- Arnold Schwarzenegger made cinematic (and meme) history by flexing his biceps and shouting ""Get to da choppa!"", making a pretty charismatic commando. Danny Glover is the other end of the spectrum -- hard-nosed and low-voiced, he has a low-key energy that makes him a convincing cop, but not necessarily a thoroughly convincing alien fighter. Adrian Brody is a bit better, with his wiry, hyper-intense, Batman-voiced merc who becomes the unofficial leader of a rather unruly band of killers.

""Predator Triple Feature"" is a good way to introduce yourself to the Predator universe -- while light on supplemental features, it's an entertaining trio of sci-fi/action movies with lots of skinned bodies and ripped-out spines.",1478995200,,3991,5.06544901065449

They are led by Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger), but everybody knows he is really Austrian like me, so I don't know where they came up with this stupid nickname. Anyways, this alien is really horrible, just turning people into bloody pulps. Further insulting he usually gets it all over other people which is not very nice of him! Well, finally Dutch catch's up to him and says something really bad about his appearance which really hurts his feelings.

It has everything you could want and then some. There has been a lot of talk about the picture quality on the first two films. Well, let me tell you that you should put your fears away. Both Predator and Predator 2 have wonderful high-def quality pictures that light up your HD TV sets. No more murky screens where you can't make out what your seeing. Yet, in the nighttime scenes there are still things you can't see, which is what the film makers intended. If you like all three of these film, which I do, then you owe it to yourself to get this set. It's far cheaper to get this set than to get the films individually.

These films are a joy to watch, and I am so glad that I can finally replace my dvds of the first two films. I really hope they will make a Predator 3 like I've been hearing, which I hope will address at least the first two films.",1433894400,13,1009,4.174358974358975

I think Danny Glover does a good job in the movie. The new Predators is a fresh take on the series. I enjoyed all the characters and seeing their strengths and weaknesses. The trilogy was a good price for three solid movies.",1433548800,7,532,4.2772277227722775

6598213,5,B00MP2FKLU,"I loved the idea In the original with Arnie. And the star cast it was very original & for me a cult movie. no 2 was all in all a good film, now the 3rd instalment was a very interesting take on the Predator 3logy, phychos, murderer's, Jakuza, Mercenaries, Cartel. Now the whole idea improves & if they could set up a clever spin off. There are no limits.  Let's say they kidnap Arnie with other candidates????. As the one that got away?. I had to add this to my collection as I to believe even if you are not a Predator fan, it's definitely a collection for keeps. Enjoy.",1432252800,,571,4.1909090909090905

6598230,4,B00MP2FKLU,The first Predator film is still a classic although the other two are a little on the boring side. The Blu-Ray conversion is decent but there's a dearth of bonus materials.,1430265600,2,172,4.580645161290323

6598234,5,B00MP2FKLU,"It has special features in all three Blu Rays and for the most part crystal clear in the Predator and Predator 2 movies. But as for Predators I feel that the quality should have been slightly better but that's just being nit-picky. Other than that, great value for the amount of features and the fact that if you were to buy all three Blu Rays separately it would cost more. Lastly I think that the Falconer Predator cover art is just amazing.",1429056000,,443,4.414634146341464
6598235,3,B00MP2FKLU,I had forgotten how bad those first two movies really were. I mean B movie stuff with an A movie budget had more than those first two films. The third movie was actually better than the first two by miles and miles. The actors were good for the most part but they would still say things that only very stupid people would say. I liked the predators idea but predator2 just sucked. I got this for my library - period.,1428969600,,416,4.2125

8673623,5,B00MP2FKLU,I have already pre ordered this I am beyond excited to see these classic films in crispy 4K! I'm glad I didn't not bother buying the blu Ray set. Honestly didn't even know they was releasing a big bundle of them. I only had first seen part 1 was dropping in 4K for 30$. So getting part 2 and part 3 in 4K and regular blu Ray is a dream come true for 17.99.  I wish the case artwork was a little better. That doesn't matter much though. We will see how it turns out. I will make an edit when I watch and review all 3 films on release day!! Happy hunting!,1533340800,,553,3.893805309734513
