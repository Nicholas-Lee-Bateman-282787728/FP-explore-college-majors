3676609,5,B001L1I59A,This is an awesome collection of the first 3 television shows about monster trucks from the mid 80's! These dvd's include footage that was cut out when they were sold on video 25 years ago. Well woorth the buy.,1358553600,,210,4.410256410256411
3676610,1,B001L1I59A,I ordered this for my 3 year old because he saw monster trucks on tv and loved it. This is mostly talking and very little monster truck action.,1352764800,,143,4.142857142857143

3676613,4,B001L1I59A,"I was pretty surprised when I searched Monster Trucks here and this came up. When I was 5 or 6 my dad bought me The Return of the Monster Trucks VHS tape, which I proceeded to what I don't how many times over and still have it to this day. I had seen Battle but didn't even know there was a War. Return is the best for straight up Monster Trucks and Battle is good mix of mid-80's niche motor sports, War of the Monster Trucks was mix like The Battle but not as good.
There aren't any extras or special additions, it looks good but its really just the original VHS copy put on DVD.
If your a classic motor sports fan like me or a current Monster Truck fan and want to see the way it started, Monster Truck Classics this is a must buy, especially for the price, but be warned, the trucks are ssslllllooooooww[...]

P.S. If your an Indycar fan you'll get kick out of seeing Jack Arute in what has to be one of his earliest announcing gigs.",1322524800,,937,4.120218579234972

I would have liked to hear the trucks running and smashing the cars instead of the narrator. But, I do recommend this dvd set. It shows how the original monster trucks started it all.",1301875200,3,309,4.636363636363637
3676616,1,B001L1I59A,Very disappointed.  Got as Christmas gift for 5 year old son.  He loves monster trucks and has other videos.  This one could not hold his attention.  It spends most of it's time on boring commentary and interviews.  Too much talking and not enough action.,1294012800,2,255,4.704545454545454

8316821,5,B001L1I59A,"This is a blast from my childhood. I saw War of the Monster Trucks, the third of these many a time as a child. It is primitive in a way to the modern day trucks but this is the genesis of the sport. Monsters did not always fly high and clear dirt mounds or hit van piles, they crushed cars, pulled sleds and ran mud bogs. I love both eras honestly. Those who think this it not good don't realize where monster trucks came from. They came from putting bigger tires on production trucks and drag racing engines under the hood. It wasn't always tube frames and fiberglass people.",1473465600,,576,4.293577981651376
