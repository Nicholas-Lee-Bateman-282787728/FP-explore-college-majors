1115603,5,7538445226,"This film tells the true story of the NAZI appointed SonderKommandos who were Jewish prisoners assigned to exterminate other fellow Jews and dispose of their corpses through cremation in exchange for exceptional living qualities and roughly an extra 4 months of life depending on how well they performed their tasks. The Kommandos would convince the Jews that the sooner they showered and became disinfected the sooner they would be reunited with their families, which of course were lies, little did the Jews know that the showers were gas chambers. But through committing these horrible tasks the Kommandos were secretly planning the only revolt ever committed inside the Jewish concentration camps.
The Grey Zone has no CGI, no slam bang action sequences, nor does it feature a blaring soundtrack, it simply relies on what good old film consists of; Acting, direction, and cinematography. Everything featured in this film is worthy of the highest praise. The cast provides excellent performances, and the one who surprised me most was David Arquette. I must say I found his performance Oscar worthy and I believe that he is truly talented as he has steered clear of his goofy lovable self and taken on a serious, much controversial role. Tim Blake Nelson provides excellent, realistically disturbing direction that makes it appear as though you are actually there, witnessing the horrible accounts of these ill fated lives. You get this feeling in you that makes you get a feeling of the conditions the Kommandos went through, feeling trapped, knowing death is inevitable, and though however horrible these tasks they performed you still have empathy for the Kommandos and you can actually get a sense of understanding as to why they do what they do to survive, if only for temporary satisfaction.
I guess what was best about The Grey Zone is how it accurately portrays human instability in uncertain times. The Grey Zone essentially asks the question of what would we do to keep living, if someone held a gun to your head and said, ""You can die now or you can die in 4 months"", I think I know the answer that any Human would give, including myself. And when you view what these people went through and how scared they were, I think you'll understand their decisions and given the options it's hard to truthfully criticize these men. But these issues constantly plague the Kommandos, and once you see their spectacular and heroic if not meaningless uprising, it shows that good resides in all of us no matter how grim and inhuman we appear. I particularly enjoyed seeing the Kommandos revolt and up rise, thus redeeming themselves and doing something so noble, as these men knew that once the revolt began they were not going to make it out alive and that this was their last shot at glory. The Grey Zone lacks in no department, it provides the most realistic view of the Holocaust I've seen to date, and though there is no happy ending, I enjoyed it's realistic point of view on life, no matter how grisly.
The Grey Zone is only playing at 31 screens across the US but with the rave reviews it's receiving and all the positive criticism, I'm sure it will reach a theater near you and I think that if you must view a film this year than let The Grey Zone fill that movie going need. But be prepared that this film is truthfully painful and is not about great music and CGI effects, as it was produced for only $5 million and it features no score. In fact only 2 scenes feature any musical integration, one of which includes the uprising, which is the most satisfying scene in the film. But The Grey Zone simply relies on the ability of the actor's and the style of old fashion story telling that sadly appears to have become a minority in Hollywood now a days. All in all I would say this is the best film of the year I've seen and I can see Oscar nominations in it's hopefully long future. I highly recommend The Grey Zone, and solid 5 stars out of 5.",1035590400,4,3955,4.6757532281205165
1115604,5,7538445226,"The GREY ZONE, to begin with, is very aptly named.  It is aptly named because it deals with a group of prisoners, known as Sondercommandos (Special Squads) whose responsibility it was to strip, gas and cremate prisoners, mostly Jews in the death camp of Auschwitz.  They slaved between the thousands of prisoners themselves and the Nazis in charge of the operation of the camp.  It is the most graphic depiction of the killing that took place in Birkenau, also known as Auschwitz II, that I have ever seen.  The film is based on fact, that is, events that actually took place. The film does an excellent job in depicting the killing process from strippiing the victims of clothes, jewlery, hair, etc., gassing them, and then shoveling them into the ovens that make up the crematorium.  The film also recreates one of the most amazing events of the Auschwitz experience:  blowing up crematorium #3 by the sondercommandos who received the gunpowder to do so from women working in a munitions plant. This is a very courageous film. For many it will provide quite an education, but you will need a strong stomach.  There are references in the film to historical incidents  which, if you had not studied the subject, might be confusing or just  over your head.  Individuals are not always identified clearly. But having said that, this is a film a long time in coming.  It should have been produced years ago.  It is powerful.  And it should be seen by all.",1033084800,10,1452,4.714285714285714
1115605,4,7538445226,a powerful performance of a group of actors guided by a talented director to show the real happening in the Nazi era death camp.

1115648,5,7538445226,"I teach a semester long Holocaust class for juniors and seniors in high school, and I use this movie in class almost every semester.  It shows the revolt of the Sonderkommandos at Auschwitz in 1944. The Sonderkommandos worked for the Nazis processing bodies and leading victims into the gas chambers.  For this work, they were allowed to live an extra four months and given unlimited food and alcohol.  After four months, they were killed like most of the Jews.  The movie is really like watching a filmed play with lots of dialogue.  If you are interested in this aspect of the Holocaust then you should watch it.",1472860800,2,614,4.700934579439252

The story does take a little while to 'get into', it has some slow parts, but it draws you in and ends up being pretty enjoyable. I could give more information, but I don't want to spoil the story for you. It's a gripping tale of prisoners who are desperately to survive the most brutal time in history. It's definitely not a feel good movie, but it's a pretty good representation of what life in a camp must of been like.

1115679,4,7538445226,This is about Hungarian Jewish workers in the Auschwitz camp as they are putting the bodies from the gas chamber in the ovens-they discover a young girl is still alive. She is still unable to speak. These men do what they can to prevent the Nazis from seeing her until that plan fails. There's a news about an uprising in the camp. In the end the workers are executed by being shot by having to lie on their stomachs on the grass. The girl who survived the gas is forced to run away but she's shot as well-she's the one who narrates the story in the end (it's a voice-over).,1440892800,,574,4.2272727272727275
1115680,5,7538445226,"I did not know what this film was about when I started to watch it.  It was part of a ""dip"" into a pile of DVD's with no covers that I got to watch whilst nursing my sick cat Dusty.

Like some other reviewers I had to make a decision to keep watching.  I have read much about the Holocaust, and seen many of the films, but none with the immediacy and the realism of ""The Grey Zone"".

I agree with other reviewers that the horror of this film puts an image into the words I have read before, but not really taken in.  It is like the difference between being in Vietnam during the war, and reading about the war never having been there. Horror cannot properly be described in words, and not even on film, but honest realistic filming has more impact.  Even so, I find that words give one time to reflect, and get in touch with one's own feelings, whereas film, and especially this one, moves from one horrendous scene to another, and although the horror is there, feelings do not have time to surface.

Except the scene where the women are being shot by the Germans trying to find out where the explosive powder was hidden.  That scene was given time and was gut-wrenching.  And the end of the film prepares us for our own reflection about what we have just seen.

Every aspect of the life of the Sonderkommando (Special Unit) was shown, and from the beginning I realised that this film was not going to be an enjoyable (or comfortable) viewing.  Some of the scenes were only seconds long, but had an impact that added to the whole.

The complaints about the accents of the actors is ludicrous.  How an American playing the part of a German or a Hungarian can appear more authentic if using a German or Hungarian accent whilst speaking English is beyond me.  Perhaps some of the more scrupulous reviewers would have had everyone speaking in their original language, and have us looking at sub-titles all the time.  How ridiculous,  for Gods sake this is a film, not time travel.

And what a film it is.  Searingly honest and true to death - a monument to those who suffered, those who fought back, and those who died.

And I was alive when the real events happened.  That I was born into a world where only some hundreds of miles away such suffering and intolerance was going on,  still has me shaking my head in bewilderment.  And looking at the world today, I do not doubt that similar events could take place.

I will keep my copy of this movie, and lend it to friends who are persuaded to watch it..  I may never watch it again, I don't know, but to dispose of it would not sit well with me.  To my mind, it serves a purpose no book or other movie has done - a brilliant movie that does not deserve the nit-picking that some reviewers have indulged in.

Watch it - you will not like what you see - but I think we all need to see it.",1440806400,2,2834,4.290018832391714

Not saying they did or didn't deserve it, but not all were as guilty as some; certainly not the children who spent all of their childhood and a good part of adulthood in misery.

The movie depicts prisoners in train cars sitting or standing around awaiting their fate when in actuality the prisoners were so tightly packed into the rail cars there was virtually no room to move, barely enough to breath; many of the prisoners died on the trains before arriving at the camps.

In the movie, when the trains arrived at the camp, the prisoners were led off the trains whereas history shows the Nazis terrorized the prisoners from the instant the rail car doors opened.

Things like what I mentioned above are important for historical accuracy, and the movie failed on many points throughout, but since it was not intended as a documentary I still gave it the four stars.",1418169600,,955,4.775757575757575

The fact that they were successful, if only in a small way, is a testament to their determination and courage.

1116147,4,7538445226,"This is a really interesting movie. It has a lot of plots and sub plots, and the characters while somewhat shallow seem to become understandable. I constantly wonder what I would have done in a similar situation and have often wondered what made the Sonderkommando tick. This answers both inquiries. It is a powerful movie; it has some weaknesses (like casting Harvey Keitel as a camp guard) but delivers on many levels. The biggest flaw was the somewhat disjointed way the story unfolds. I think it suffers from trying to tell too many stories rather than focusing on one. But I would still recommend it.

That being said, this is not for young people as it is gritty and not a ""feel good"" movie. You will go away with the understanding of how the holocaust occurred and what happened to millions of people savaged and used as slave labor with no more thought than using a hammer and throwing it away when you were done with it.

The look and feel are good and the look inside the death chambers was chilling and scary. The strange morality of the camps was brought forth, such as what happens when one would survive the cyanide gas. The Sonderkommando and the Jewish doctor really are sad characters who know they will not survive the camps as they know too much. Some are doing it for family which should be evident as a false hope, but the human mind can rationalize just about anything.

Overall, this movie needs to be seen and is one of those ""sleepers"" that people need to see. I can't figure out why I never heard of it before other than people don't like to be reminded of the pain of the death camps. Watch this and then check out a comedy...",1412121600,,1653,4.466887417218543

The reason for the 3-star review is fairly simple:  Pretty lousy dialogue.  Questions constantly being answered by questions, and nothing ever really being said.  Frankly, it was painful to listen to most of the time.  I wanted to understand these men so much more - to find some sympathy for them and their cause.  But I felt nothing.  Perhaps that is what the director was intending...for us to feel nothing like they felt nothing...for a desperation to feel...and if that is the case, then I have done a disservice with this review and should award 5 stars, instead.  But I could just never get into the characters...except maybe at the very end, and only for a moment.

That all said, I think it is a movie worth watching (if you have a strong stomach) simply because it tells a story from the Holocaust that I had not heard before....and you may not have heard either.

1116262,4,7538445226,"Heartbreaking, disturbing, shocking depiction of World War II concentration camps. Truly a barbaric experience, something that is and should be remembered. It's a Great War film about the genocide and about the horrors of the Holocaust and the select few that stood up.

An all-star cast wonderful actors building the characters into believable scenarios. This is a reality in the historical value of the incidents taking place. This holds nothing back, specifically the ovens, the burning of the bodies, the showers and those few that rose up against the Nazis. A select few joined together to blow up the gas chambers, the crematoriums to damage and to try and stop the genocide. These that rose up and fought had already given in and did the work of the Nazis, such as lying to their fellow Jews, sending them, and helping them go into the showers and ultimately, burning their bodies in the crematorium.

This is based on actual events and the scenario is created through the testimony of Miklos Nyiszli. His written book was called Auschwitz: A Doctor's Eyewitness Account. Dr. Miklos Nyiszli volunteered to work alongside the vilest human in history the infamous ""Angel of Death""--Dr. Josef Mengele.

You see one way to save yourself from ending up in the gas showers or roasting and turning into ash  was to help the Nazis. You would be bosses and in charge of your own race and sadly many of the cases, the Jew would be as brutal just like the Nazis. Certain Jews would end up agreeing to certain things or if you had certain traits they would keep you alive. Not all of these Jews where horrible but there on race considered them evil. Most where looked on as betraying their own race and agreeing to kill their own kind and to work with the beast known as the German Nazis? This movie details some of those heroes inside the concentration camps that rose up against, because they ultimately knew they would die anyways and plus most could not live with themselves knowing what they had done.

They were known as Jewish Sonderkommando XII in the Auschwitz concentration camp. They were Jews that helped the Nazi's usher in their final solution by a means of a faster assembly line through lying and helping them line up and sending them to the showers which ultimately where gas chambers of death.

There are many horrors in the world. Many acts of depravity throughout history, but one dark stain of reality is World War 2. The Nazi's are the beacon of hate and the bodification of evil. A moment in history that forever stained the makeup of time. A powerful example of what true hell could be like in the actions and situations caused by a race of men and women calling themselves the superior race, when in honesty, the nasty reality was, man destroying his own self.

Powerful and haunting. A true nightmare inducing depravity. The disturbing reality and the matter of fact nature of pure evil acts play with your mind. This disturbs the very basic foundations of human emotions. The dark concept of such hateful and lack of humanity in the images and actions bear down upon the reader.

It's a part of true history that stains its very reality into us all wanting to know the true logic of what happened at that camp, that death camp. This is a part of history that should be seen, read and educated with, in schools and in general population, so that we don't repeat the atrocities of these death dealers.

This movie, ""The Grey Zone"" , I just happened to stumble upon years ago when I still rented from video stores and vhs was still on the market. This production is a retelling of what went on at one of the many concentration camps during WWII. This particular camp was in Germany and was one of the most brutal. I am not sure if there is an exact number on people that were tortured and murdered there. Even if it had only been 1 it would have been too many regardless. I took a chance on renting this movie and I am so glad that I did. There are many fine performances and Harvey Keitel's is really outstanding. Steve Buscemi is good as always and Mira Sorvino's character performance is one that can leave you with tears in your eyes.

2.  Horrible acting.
3.  No attempt at accents.
4.  Claustrophobic look, tight shots, etc.  This, I assume, was because they didn't have much of a budget so kept the shots tight so that they wouldn't have to build expensive sets.

The acting IS quite poor, the script overly verbose and even wooden at times, and of course the characters all speak in English even though they are supposed to be Germans/Hungarians/Poles. Also the entire film is based primarily on the memoirs of Dr. Miklos Nyszili, parts of which are now are disputed.

However, this film is nonetheless an absolutely chilling portrayal of what went on inside the camps, and in particular the grisly nature of the activities that occurred within the gas chambers/crematoria. To that end the film goes way beyond any other holocaust film, even Schindlers List, in showing what occurred there. For those reasons this film is an absolute must-see, and I am sure the viewer will find it to be an utterly moving if not horrifying experience.

And of course the film also does justice to what was a heroic act of resistance at Auschwitz that has been largely overlooked by history. Unlike many films in the POW/Uprising genre, the characters in The Gray Zone knew that they had no chance of survival or even prolonging their lives by rebelling against the SS. But they did so anyway, if for no other reason so that they did not go down without a fight. Anyone who attempts to understand one of the major paradoxes of the Holocaust, which is the passivity with which so many of its victims accepted their fate, would certainly do well to see this historical episode as it is portrayed in The Gray Zone.",1301702400,3,1543,4.753731343283582

1116369,2,7538445226,"This movie is probably the most detailed movie yet on Auschwitz but despite saying that it is still plagued with real inaccuracies that can't be forgiven. The most notable being the true role of SS Hauptscharfuhrer Otto Moll who in the movie is relegated to being a very minor character and acutally has been demoted in the film. In the film he is represented as a Scharfuhrer and subordinate to oberscharfuhrer Muhsfeldt. As stated above in actuality Otto Moll was a Hauptscharfuhrer (SS Master Sergeant) and was Muhsfeldt's boss. Moll ran and was chief head of the extermination zone at Auschwitz which included all 4 of the birkenau crematoria. It was Moll who organised the acutal murder of pretty much every victim of the gas chambers and the burning pits or pyres. Get it right Tim...this is unforgivable...Muhsfeldt did not have that much responsibility, he was only the boss of Crematorium II not the entire extermination plant.

Also, pretty much every character in the movie is a weasel who you don't care if they live or die. But this in actual fact is probably pretty accurate as the members of the sonderkommando had to lie, cheat, steal and kill in order to survive.

All in all though it is a pretty decent movie....more like a tele movie than a major motion picture....although there was many acts of brutality the film doesn't dare go near....the mass shootings at the burning pits where babies and kids were chucked in alive by Moll for example...I suppose no-one has the balls to depict these acts in any film.....",1285027200,2,1533,4.803030303030303

You read, you discuss, but the sheer inhumanity of leading your countrymen into a gas chamber, listening to their deaths, and then rolling them into a crematorium defies description by any words that I know of. This film does not sentimentalize, it's not heartwarming, and it is unrelentingly brutal.

As far as the artistic merits of the film are concerned, I do not have a problem with neutral accents of the Sonderkommandos.  Indeed, it adds to the humanity of the men placed in a horrific situation, at least when viewed by western audiences.

The clipped dialogue betrays ""The Grey Zone""'s stage roots - but in the end, the dialogue is not particularly necessary.  We are shown the horror of the 12th Sonderkommando groups day-to-day existence, and their moral dilemma that is only relieved when they are inevitably executed by the SS.

I can't say I enjoyed this film, but I'm glad I saw it.",1252281600,2,920,4.865384615384615
1116373,3,7538445226,"As one who regularly teaches Holocaust literature and film, I was finally disturbed at the anachronisms of the language and attitudes of these men of the Sonderkommandos (who did not, by the way, as one reviewer claimed, 'elect' to join; many did not even know what they were selected for -- and those who refused were immediately killed)
but more to the point, Michael Perry is right on target with his comment:
 Those who made this film seem captive their own culture and place in history, unaware that any other exists. Most of those involved in these historical events were born in Eastern Europe in the first three decades of the twentieth century. That was a culture far different from our own. In the film, they are portrayed as acting and sounding like they were born our West coast in the last decades of the twentieth century. They're vain, self-obsessed and foul-mouthed with small and petty egos. [they could be East Coast too, by the way]

I'm not talking about a lack of the slight Hungarian accents that more talented filmmakers might have added to lend a bit of realism. The problem is not that most of the characters have modern American accents. The problem is that their attitudes and the content of what they're saying is that of today's Los Angeles rather than the Budapest of long ago. Their debates about what to do have all the sallowness of those waiting in line to get tickets for a rock concert. The result rings untrue. ""

This is why I would never teach this film or recommend it to my students.
more's the pity, since the film takes risks in other ways.

Finally, for those interested in personal testimony, besides Filip Mller, who appears in Lanzmann's Shoah, author of Eyewitness Auschwitz - Three Years in the Gas Chambers, there is the most recent: nside the Gas Chambers: Eight Months in the Sonderkommando of Auschwitz by Shlomo Venezia (Wiley & Sons, 2009),  The Holocaust odyssey of Daniel Bennahmias, Sonderkommando  Rebecca Camhi Fromer, and the excellent work of Gideon Greif, We Wept Without Tears: Testimonies of the Jewish Sonderkommando from Auschwitz, and the rare book, Scrolls of Auschwitz, containing translations of the testimony buried in bottles and other receptacles in the crematoria in Auschwitz.",1234828800,50,2252,4.882198952879581

1116386,5,7538445226,"This is a tale set within the confines of the Auchswitz-Birkenau death camps.  It is a tale of the depths that people are capable of sinking to to save a few weeks of life.  The men of Sonderkommando 12 work in the selection and clothes changing areas.  They lead people to the gas chambers under the pretext of disinfection.  When the victims are all dead, they disentangle the corpses and search them for hidden jewelry--they cut the hair and they pull out the teeth.  Afterwards, they work in the living Hell of the crematoria, incinerating bodies that are at least partly their personal victims.

There is a plot to destroy the crematoria coupled with a major prison break.  Arms are smuggled in from Polish partisans.  The Germans, who have informants everywhere, quickly learn of the plot but don't know how, where or what.  Three women from a work detail in a munitions factory are discovered with powder--illicit explosives.  They are ruthlessly tortured with electric shock but don't break.  They are afterall going to die anyway.  They have second thoughts, however, when the Nazis line up the women in their section and shoot them down, all the while asking the million dollar question.  Half are murdered but no one talks.

The plot is almost foiled, howeve, when a prisoner discovers a still living girl under a pile of gassed people.  He convinces others, including the camp doctor, to assist in her resuscitation and hiding.  Trying to hide the girl places the whole operation at risk.  The Commandant discovers her and, in exchange for her life, tries to bribe his brilliant Jewish doctor for more information about the plot.  The doctor denies everything except, to say, that there is a plot.  The Commandant isn't pleased.

The plot goes forward.  Arms are seized and the main crematorium goes up in a series of explosions.  Efforts to hold off the trained soldiers, brought in to repel the rebellion are largely hopeless.  Many are killed outright and those who survive are systematically shot in the head.  The young girl, who has survived so much, is shot down by the Commandant.

This is a powerful, grim and gruesome story of one of the greatest wrongs in history--the systematic demolition of a people.  It asks the very pertinent question:  How far would you go to save your own life?  Are you above collaboration and murder?

1116388,4,7538445226,"One of the hardest things to understand about the Shoah was how so many people ""just walked"" into the gas chambers.  Harder still is to understand why people chose to help out the Germans.  When you watch how the people coming off the trains were treated, you ask yourself why didn't they rebel. Well part of the reason was that they were told by their own that they were going in for showers.  Why would you fight against that?

What if there were no SonderKommandos? Would the Germans not have hired other people (Poles and Balts) who would have been happy to do the work just like they did in the Eastern Camps?  Would these 'others' have treated those going to the 'chambers' any better or worse?  If you were there, what would you do to stay alive, even if for only four more months?

What doesn't show is the years of humiliation, like a woman who have suffered years of abuse by her husband.  That is what these people were like when they came into the Jagers.  They had first been stripped of all their rights and then spent years in forced ghettos living like convicts.

One thing that was missing from the movie is the condition of the people when they go out of the 'cars'.  Most had been in them at least for forty -eight hours, with no food or water and one bucket for urine and feces.  There may have been up to 120 people in a car that could fit maybe sixty.  Many were forced to stand for the whole trip.  Some would have died enroute and there was no way to get rid of the bodies.  When the cars were opened the people inside were so traumatized that they were like robots.  Some had even gone insane while locked up and the rest would have had to endure their screaming and ranting during the trip.

It's hard to imaging what these people endured before they were gassed.  In many cases, as they left the cars, anyone who complained were shot on the spot.  These were normal, law abiding people, how would you reach if someone shot the person next to you in the head, and their brains and blood were splattered all over you, having endured 48 hours or more stuffed in a cattle car?

This may seem raw, but was mild compared to the actual camps.  The one part that was close was when they were shooting the woman, to get the other two woman to confess.  The German in charge, took no notice of the screaming of the woman about to be shot or that they were not involved.  To them all Jews were 'untermenschen' (underpeople) who would all be killed eventually.  So did it matter if we did it now or later?

It is about the horrors of Auschwitz, what it took to run that place, what some were forced to do to stay alive for a bit longer, and what bravery some showed in trying to stop the horror even for a few hours or a few days.  It is not for the squeamish, those who are afraid to see piles of naked bodies being stuffed into ovens, or hearing the screams of the dying as they were being gassed.  Then there are the conversations among the living about staying alive, being dead, what they should or shouldn't do, and the Nazi's torturing prisoners to get information they think they need.

There was indeed a prisoner riot at Auschwitz, but not every detail in this movie is historically accurate.  However, there are no exaggerations of the horror and monstrous acts.  In fact, they are probably still understated.  The acting in the movie is very good, but beware before you watch it.  Seriously, this movie could traumatize someone not prepared for what they are going to see in this harsh movie.

It is not all bleak, however, there is tremendous power in the scenes involving the preparations and smuggling of material to prepare for the sabotage and riot.  There is also the girl whom the prisoners try to hide and revive because she survived the gas.  Dr. Miklos Nyiszli, played wonderfully by Allan Corduner, is based on a real life person of the same name who was forced into doing autopsies on twins for Josef Mengele in order to try and protect his own wife and child.  His moral dilemma is among the most crushing in the movie.  Steve Buscemi's role as Hesch Abramowics is also very memorable.  He is a complete cynic, or is he?  You have to decide.  Asking yourself what you would do in the horror of Auschwitz is part of the movie.  It is easy to say you would refuse, but dying just for yourself isn't the issue, you have a spouse, and probably children.  Do you just walk with them into the poison gas and or shove their bodies into the ovens?

Really, a very powerful and powerfully disturbing movie.  For the right people, this is very much worth seeing and thinking about.  Be beware before you watch it.  You will be disturbed by it.

1116391,4,7538445226,"This is an almost impossible topic to do well; Nelson and company came very close.  There are a few historical errors, and the relationship between SS and prisoners - with the exception of the people like Nyszli - was rarely as ""conversational"" as the film suggests.  The hierarachy within the sonderkommando itself is also missing, which was a key part of what they had to contend with.  Typically, SS spoke directly (in the form of giving orders) to non-Jewish kapos; not to the class of prisoners who figure centrally in the film.  Likewise, the frenetic pace of the work when there was a transport to be ""disposed of"" was not shown here.  I assume this was in the interest of everything being ""matter of fact,"" which _is_ generally true to the sonderkommando's everday adaptation to their task.

I found the mix of accents confusing - why did only the Germans get them?  And some of the interaction around planning the rebellion needed a bit more context, I think.

That said, there is more here that is _essentially_ true than in most Holocaust films.  The grayness of the film itself fit its subject.

The entire time I was watching this tremendous re-enactment I kept thinking (whenever her character was on screen) who is this woman? Where did they find her? I simply could not connect her to the wonderful, scene-stealing job she did in Mighty Aphrodity; the actress is that good here.

I do my best to keep from writing lengthy reviews (very often skip over them as well when wanting to find out about a film am interested in, etc.) so I won't go into the plot and what happens. Will only say that, although I always look foreward to seeing Harvey Keitel on screen, I only wish that he had refrained from going with a German accent. Not many American actors can do a foreign accent and do it well, not even Meryl Streep--and I don't care what some people might say about that. Accents never sound right. They should have just hired a German actor to play the part, etc.

All in all, kudos to the folks for making the film. It just might leave you choking back a sob or two. Strong stuff. Am currently reading Eyewitness Auschwitz by Filip Muller (and I have read others on the subject.) This film struck me as pretty authentic--and am glad it was made.

The Jews who cooperated maybe got to live a little longer, maybe got a little more food, an extra blanket. It's amazing what the will to survive will do to a human being. And, without those survivors telling their stories, holocaust deniers would not even need to exist. There would be nothing to deny.

Again, the images in this movie are haunting, moving, and should cause one to think and to dig deeper into what we think we know about the holocaust, and about man's inhumanity to man. We may think we know what horror man is capable of. We can only remain aware as long as our eyes remain open - and our hearts remain connected to our souls.

These men, whom Auschwitz survivor and acclaimed author, Primo Levi, called ""the ravens of the crematoria"" were all Jews and were kept alive for the grisly work of herding their fellow-Jews into the gas chambers and then burning the bodies in the crematoria ovens. They received privileges denied other Jewish prisoners for carrying out this hellish work but were themselves murdered and replaced after about 3 months because the Nazis considered they knew too much about their heinous crimes. With Dantesque and nightmarish realism the movie depicts the horror of the men's existence, their brutalisation and their simultaneous efforts to cling to a shred of humanity, for example saving the girl who survives the gas,and to make a stand against the monsters who have forced their moral corruption. Also noteworthy is the courage of the Jewish women who smuggled explosives to the men of the sondercommando and who were themselves subjected to hideous torture and subsequent execution.

May history never repeat itself in this case. The dark story of the holocaust and events at Auschwitz are even darker when considering that there were some willing to betray their own people in the hope that they might survive, even if only for a while longer. When a handful of the prisoners plan an uprising, their plot is complicated when a young girl is revived, having somehow lived through the gas chamber. Though the scenes of the crematoria are graphic and very chilling, this is a movie to watch if you can deal with some tough realities. This is definitely adult-only material.

On one level you feel bad for criticizing a sincere effort, but on the other when a film with this subject matter (the revolt of the Jewish and Polish Sonderkomandos who ran the crematoriums in Auschwitz in return for a few more months of life) doesn't actually make you FEEL, there's definitely something wrong with it. A few of the performances (Steve Buscemi, Daniel Benzali, David Arquette) are excellent, but far too many are inadequate (especially Alan Corduner in a key role) or just plain bad (Harvey Keitel and Bryan O'Byrne's unfortunately comic book Nazis). The dialogue in director Tim Blake Nelson's script, based on his play, is extremely problematic, to put it mildly. Aiming for evasiveness, it often just sounds like bad Beckett or Pinter (""But -"", ""Of course."" ""Although - "" ""I know"" ""Then...""), with one line often seemingly unrelated to another and badly staged inadvertent momentary pauses where it should have overlapped. But the biggest problem is it's failure to offer much substance or, until the last half hour, much drama. The last 20 minutes do become involving and the ending is genuinely haunting, but the film seems seriously under-developed.

And yet that would not be large enough to represent how important the subject matter is. However, one crumb, one shred, one sliver of the reality is all that should ever be needed for anyone and everyone to ""get it."" Period.

You need all the extras and bells and whistles when it comes to human slaughter? The sound was too low and you had to strain to hear? Well maybe it's time we all quiet down and listen. The plot was too slow? What, didn't they get to the killing quick enough for you? And once they did, were you getting bored waiting for the next exciting plot twist? Unreal. Dialogue weak, not great enough performances, plot too slow, accents not authentic enough, and the camera work not smooth enough? Yea, like what really helps gives a good impression of the holocaust is  a smooth glossy slick piece of work. This movie wasn't hopeful or uplifting enough? Something happens, which I can't reveal, which raised my spirits high enough to evoke a joyful cheer out of me, even if it was only a second or so of glee. Comon', you know you cheered too! You know the moment I mean, right? Too much of the ""F"" word? At the point when society turns upside down and mass murder becomes institutionalized and accepted, I can't think of a better word to use. It is just a word and it's more then about time that society grows up and evolves past such trivial hang-ups anyway. Oh, I forgot this is a movie review and not a society review. Anyway, as far as this movie is concerned, I think the visual part was just enough to make it real, without being gratuitous. I think the dialogue was plain enough to make you identify somewhat with a group of people who  it's hard to imagine  being, or being in their shoes.  I think the lack of accents helped with this wasn't the only accents the German ones? I guess the German Nazi are the ""Them"" of this movie. The best dialogue in the movie was the voices heard from inside after the gas chamber doors were sealed. I don't think any other vocalizations in the movie were more important. It's too erie that they sort of resemble the sound of a crowd on roller coaster, the mass screaming. of coarse there is a huge difference here also. The plot was what it should be given that it was taken from a historically factual event. This was a great movie that managed to keep the focus on what is really important. I recommend that everyone should see this movie. And anyone with children should, when they feel there kids are mature enough to handle it, watch it with them.

1116430,5,7538445226,"The Grey Zone was originally a book that was adapted into a play by Tim Blake Nelson (O, Eye Of God, Kansas) and now, Tim Blake Nelson has adapted his play into a movie that is almost unknown to the public. This film is based on a book called Auschwitz: A Doctor's Eyewitness Account by Miklos Nyiszli. The film deals with one of the darkest times in the human history, Auschwitz, 1944. The story is about Sonderkommandos, a group of Jews forced to work for the Nazi's against their own kind for an exchange of having their life extended for couple of more months. As you can imagine, Sonderkommandos are put in the worst situation possible, but they all refuse to admit that they are helping the Nazi's even though their actions could be considered just as bad as the Nazi's. However, in the time of a war, and especially in this case, a morality does not exist, you do what you can to survive. Sonderkommandos can be considered traitors but also heroes, it all depends on how you look at it. To me, this situation is something I would never be able to handle on a mental level of sanity. I guess this story can be argued, and the argument will for sure have two sides. The pros and non's, like always, in time of a war, there is never really a common ground... sadly.

This film is extremely hard to stomach at certain points. A lifeless corpses piled up on one another, thick black smoke of burning bodies that echoes pure pain and suffering. Gas chambers filled with innocent people being tortured to death, cold-hearted Nazi's shooting people on the spot, an extremely bloody and a painful reminder to the audiences of the evil that has happened in 1994 and an unknown story of twelfth Sonderkommandos who lead the only armed uprising at the death camp. While many have judged these Sonderkommandos as traitors, the writer/director of this film has chosen to defend them.

Out of all the actors in the world I would have never thought David Arquette would be involved in this movie. I will have to say that I have a new found respect for him mainly because I was not aware that he could do well in a dramatic movie such as this one. I guess I am guilty of judging him from his previous movies, but I am glad that he proved to me and anyone else who might have doubted him, that he is capable of much more. The rest of the cast is also memorable but no one comes close to David Arquette. Kudos to Mira Sorvino who almost looks unrecognizable in this film. The acting from the cast is quite recognizable here but due to the fact that the story is so gripping, one often focuses on just the story and not the acting.

If you are looking for an answer to some question in this movie, you will not find it.  With a story such as this one, there is no real answer, only a painful reminder.",1105488000,5,2788,4.376447876447877

Other viewers complain that this film lacks entertainment. I'm sorry they missed the point, this movie is not meant to entertain. It is designed to educate on the seriousness and tragedy of one of the most heinous crimes in modern history. This is a fictionalized account surrounding an actual event, but the dialogue here serves more as a link and explanation of events rather than a story.

1116434,4,7538445226,"One cannot come away from a movie like this without feeling such sorrow at the atrocities carried out against the Jews and the depths to which mankind can sink. The Jews, like a number of people-groups throughout history, have had a very sad past, the latest being the Holocaust of WWII, and when watching this I was reminded of the biblical accounts of the numerous instances of Jewish 'slavery'.

This movie is set entirely in the concentration camp (i.e. there are no scenes of the war) and deals with the true story of Auschwitz's twelfth Sonderkommando and its attempts to fight their Nazi captors. _The Grey Zone_ might not be a Schindler's List, but I think it was more realistic in its portrayal of camp life. It is definitely a bleak film, and if you are expecting a movie about redemption or hope, then watch something 'Hollywood' instead. The Grey Zone lets you feel the sense of desperation and hopelessness that must have faced those people who knew that their days were numbered but struggled to hold onto their lives, even if it wasn't much of one.

The only fault I can find with this movie is the dialogue. The scriptwriter(s) really let this movie down by giving such unrealistic dialogues to these great actors. At times I was wondering whether this was an American drama or a movie about European Jews during World War II. I didn't see the rationale in giving the Germans a German accent while both Polish and Hungarian Jews had an American one. I would have preferred to have the actors with an accent even if it wasn't the best, rather than hear what was a very Americanized movie.

But, as I said, that was the only fault I found, so I hope it has not put you off this movie for good. I would highly recommend it, because it is a more realistic look at life within the concentration camps than some of the more rosy 'Holocaust films'.",1090972800,5,1857,4.553892215568863

I believe that if this movie helps someone understand and appreciate what the victims of these horrible places went through, then it is good.

1116447,4,7538445226,"While not perfect, The Grey Zone does have many wonderful qualities. To attack the flaws first, yest, it does feel rather stagy, with its heritage in theater all too clearly showing. And the dialog is indeed frequently extracted from some grade B 40s movie. And I did find the male leads a little unbelievable. But, in a film of this magnitude, these are minor quibbles. Prevent that fifth star, but still, an excellent film. Some have objected to Harvey Keitel's accent. Yeah, well, sure it might have been better without it, but I actually would have liked more phony German accents to distinguish the German speakers from the Jews. Other critics have objected to its violence, its nudity, and its grossness. Well, this was a violent, naked time. I am no fan of gratuitous nudity or violence, but I found them effectively, even tastefully, used here, with sounds, looks, and results showing us what happened.
What's good about it? Well to start, the title is great. Contemporary morality loves to tell us that all dilemmas are shades of grey, where negotiation is the answer. If we could just discuss our differences, we could reach an amicable solution. But faced with the monstrous evil of gassing and burning Jews by the trainload, there is no grey. What discussion would be appropriate here? What negotiation? How about we stun them first before gassing them? Or cut back the number of the damned? Or maybe provide a musical accompaniment not just on their entrance to the camp, but on their exit as well? No, this is evil, pure and simple, no compromise, no place for negotiation or concession, no grey zone, but all black and white.
Another spectacular image was the lawns being watered while this evil was going on. Life was normal, even suburban, with green grass a priority in this camp, while humans were being slaughtered. The idea of grass being nurtured and cared for while people were not is beautiful. We see the lawns throughout the film, always green, always cared for, always getting what they need. What is important to this culture is evident. And despicable.
The cold-heartedness of the murders is wonderfully demonstrated in two scenes. A major character is shot when we do not expect it at all. Just bam, and he's dead. No build up, no drama, no contortions or speeches. Every one watching must act unaffected by this. And in one of the most brilliant scenes, as the newly arrived are being encouraged to remember the number of the hook where they hung their clothes, a confrontation occurs. A screaming woman is casually shot in the head to silence her. And it works. Anyone inconvenient, annoying, or unable to account for themselves properly, was shot. They were cargo, not people, and difficult cargo was removed.
I found the photography quite effective. The smokestacks flaming and spewing their ash never let us forget just what the business of this place was. The grim, muted colors, the cramped, confined feel, the oppressive editing and the well chosen music all made the feel as real as it could be for those of us in our living rooms.
Better than Schindler's List. Much better than Life is Beautiful. A film that pulls no punches, and makes a powerful case for standing up to evil even when your tools are ineffectual and your hope nonexistent.",1085616000,9,3280,4.807079646017699
1116448,5,7538445226,"I knew that ""The Grey Zone"" was about a sonder-kommando unit at a Nazi concentration camp, which in and of itself would be an intensely dramatic situation.  The sonder-dommandos where the Jews at death camps, such as Auschwitz II-Birkenau, who escorted their fellow Jews to die in the gas chambers, then took the bodies to the crematoriums, and disposed of the ashes.  For four months the sonder-kommandos carried out their duties, and enjoyed (for lack of a better word), extra food, cigarettes, and even clean sheets.  ""The Grey Zone"" is set in October of 1944, which meant that the end of the war was in site as Allied troops were moving on Germany (this is before the Hitler's last great counter offensive, the Battle of the Bulge), so four months could well mean being alive.  Of course, this is if the Nazis do not decide to kill everybody in the camp before it is liberated.
Actually, there are a lot of ""ifs"" behind this 2001 film, directed by Tim Blake Nelson and adapted from his stage play.  If you have a chance to live in a death camp, do you take advantage of that opportunity even if it means collaborating witn the Nazis who are gassing your people?  In many other cinematic tales of the Holocaust there is the recurring idea that the sonder-kommando were worst that the Nazis, because they betrayed their own people, and the biggest ""if"" of all in this film remains what would YOU do if you were in this situation?  You can say, ""No, I would never do that,"" but then how many stories about the differences between behavioral intentions and overt behavior do you want me to tell you?
I thought that haunting question was what ""The Grey Zone"" was about, but then I discovered that this was actually a historical drama, in the sense that it was based on a specific historical event: the October 7, 1944 uprising when members of the 12th sonder-kommando succeeded in blowing up two of the four crematoria at Auschwitz II-Birkenau.  We learn at the end of the film that the ovens were never replaced and the significance of this accomplishment can only be guessed at in terms of how many lives were saved because the largest of the Nazi death camps had its capacity cut in half.  But the actual revolt ends up being a relatively small part of the film.  More importantly, it sets up another moral dilemma for the men of the 12th sonder-kommando.
The leaders of the sonder-kommandos are played by David Arquette, Daniel Benzali, Steve Buscemi and David Chandler, and they have planned the revolt, while Natasha Lyonne and Mira Sorvino lead the women who work at the munitions plant and having been stealing gunpowder to be used in the attack.  I mention the names of the actors without the characters both because names had been replaced by numbers in the camps and because having people like Arquette and Buscemi unforgettably acting against type is pretty memorable.  The crisis comes on the eve of the uprising when a young girl (Kamelia Grigorova) survives the gassing and an impromptu decision is made to save her.  The idea of burning her alive is too much for these men, but the question is whether they can risk what they are about to do for one person (you can see why this worked as a stage play and again, why the uprising itself is not really the main point of the story).  This plot twist is critical, because without it ""The Grey Zone"" become less about moral dilemmas and more about one of the few times concentration camp inmates fought back against the Nazis.  Would the 12th Sonder-kommandos have done what they did if they did not believe the end of the war was in sight?  Why did the previous 11 groups never even try to do anything similar?  Questions abound in both this film and its wake.
Nelson's play is based in part on the book ""Auschwitz: A Doctor's Eyewitness Account,"" by Miklos Nyiszli (Allan Corduner), who did the autopsies for Dr. Josef Mengele's infamous experiments on twins.  He is a collaborator of a different type, doing his grim work because SS-Oberscharfuhrer Eric Muhsfeldt (Harvey Keitel) has promised to keep Nyiszli's wife and daughter alive.  Again, the question of what you would do to stay alive or to save the lives of those you love, comes to the forefront, as does the question of what would then be considered going too far and where would you draw the line?  Consequently, ""The Grey Zone"" is part of what I would call the second generation of Holocaust films, that go beyond providing the details on what happened in the camps and telling stories which are set in concentration camps.  They are still about the Holocaust, but in a different way from what we have seen, most notably on the television mini-series ""Holocaust"" and ""War and Remembrance.""",1075161600,87,4715,4.670289855072464

1116453,1,7538445226,"It is very rare that I write a review of a film, mainly due to the fact that many of my thoughts and opinions are already stated in previous reviews. I often feel that overstating these opinions is pointless. However, with this film, I will make an exception, just to reinforce my viewpoint.
I actually had my hopes up (well, at least a little bit) for this film. I am a bit of a history buff, the story seemed very interesting, and there is a core of solid actors to be viewed.
Ladies and gentleman, what could have been an intriguing, disturbing, and thought-provoking movie has become a total waste of nearly two hours of my time.
The #1 problem with this film is the dialogue. There are quite a few scenes (particularly scenes with the small groups of ""high ranking"" Jewish), that I felt came straight from some ""B"" movie. Basic conversation between the characters was portrayed terribly. The dialogue seemed very forced, very poorly written, and very poorly acted. With Steve Buscemi, Harvey Keitel, and Mira Sorvino being a part of this, I find it hard to believe that it could be so bad, but somehow, it is. They all feel very out-of-place in this film. One contributing factor to the poor dialogue was, as stated by others before me, the F-word being overused by seemingly middle-aged men from the Northern U.S. These men are supposed to be Polish and Hungarian Jews, not smart-aleks from Rhode Island!! In my humble opinion, I believe that there can only be one person to ""blame"" for this, and that person is Tim Blake Nelson, the writer/director. I don't know much of his work, but I now know enough to realize that his future work isn't worth my time.
Another frustrating part of this movie is the audio, which has also been complained about prior to this review. It is very poorly made; being very low at volume and often times feeling, again, like a ""B"" movie.
Reviewers have often commented that this film is difficult to watch and that it is ""disturbing"". The history involved in regard to what happened is certainly difficult to take, and of course, to watch. However, in my opinion, this film does very little to express or withdraw these emotions. Unfortunately, in simpleton terms, this film is CHEESY. There are so many other Holocaust related films that do a much better job of portraying the horror and despair, why waste your time on this poorly written one?

1116465,4,7538445226,"I watched The Grey Zone yesterday and am still feeling quite disturbed.
First things first, Steve Buscemi is one of my favorite actors but I'm not sure he quite fit in in The Grey Zone.  I also like Harvey Keitel but was not really feeling him in his role.  I am assuming we are all supposed to pretend the actors were Jewish or Hungarian or German, etc. Then why is it some characters were given accents and others weren't?  And like everyone else who has reviewed the movie, I feel the ""F"" word was way over used.  It definitely took away from the overall authenticity of the time period in which the movie took place.  It seemed almost as if the characters were hanging out on the corner somewhere in NYC, arguing over a bad card game.
Aside from the above, The Grey Zone succeeded in freaking me out beyond belief.  The live people going in to the gas chambers only to come out dead, shoveled into the fire and dumped into the river are images that will be with me for a while.  The scene in which they painted the gas chamber walls had the most impact on me.  Imagine them painting over the mess the people left behind as they were gassed to death?  The musical score was quite perfect.  Sad, dark, bleak.
The story was interesting and the acting was decent enough.  Do not not watch this is you're not ready to be disturbed for at least the rest of the day (or night).",1059696000,3,1374,4.307392996108949
1116466,3,7538445226,"The Grey Zone is the most graphic and realistic Holocaust film I have seen yet. It is perhaps the first Holocaust film I have seen to show large amounts of dead bodies from the gas chamber, people at work in the ovens burning the dead bodies, and finally the ashes and powder of the dead bodies being scooped up by a shovel, and tossed in the back of a truck where it will be taken away and dumped into a river. And its not just a case of removing the dead bodies from the gas chamber, but cleaning up the walls of the gas chamber as well. The human body does not take to poisonous gas very well, and the victims of gas tended to vomit on the walls and floor. And I assume on each other.  It also tells a little known fact--to me anyway--of life in the Concentration Camp. A group of prisoners were given key jobs of assisting the guards and the doctors, and were in return rewarded with food, wine, and a comparatively easy life--at least until they were deemed unnecessary, and it was their turn to go to the gas chamber. This period on the job lasted about four months at the most. All of the other holocaust films may show people entering a gas chamber, but that is all we see. Here we can associate live people, and later their dead bodies, as if we are watching before and after shots. For realism, it is this fact alone that makes this film worth owning.
On the other hand, there is much about this film that makes it questionable as a keeper. It tries so hard to present a factual and accurate film about the holocaust, that all of its energies are spent bolstering one aspect, yet it totally ignores some other area. The big turn off was the very liberal use of the ""F"" word. Its not to question whether this word was in use or not during WWII, but hearing the word used so repeatedly in a Concentration Camp seems odd. One of the keys to survival is submission to the guards, and this is done by not looking at them directly, but by responding to them while looking at the ground. What need would Jewish prisoners have for a liberal and confrontational use of the ""F"" word? You don't survive in a Concentration Camp by being confrontational. In this movie they use it on themselves a lot. Instead of turning to each other for support, they almost verbally trash each other. The reason given in this movie is that as part of the history of Auschwitz, these prisoners managed to pull off an armed revolt that result in the blowing up of one of the crematoriums, and the arguments revolved around the best way to do this. In real life, prisoners of Buchenwald, for example did manage to smuggle things out of the camp, and it was a very risky, but coordinated effort. These Jewish prisoners in ""The Grey Zone"" did not seem very much like they were working together very well. Yet, they managed to stay in top condition, ad could run like the wind when they had to.
Another thing that seemed kind of odd about the film, is that the prisoners did not exactly look like they had been starving. They were not overly thin, and one man looked like, if he had not lost weight, that he may have actually gained weight. He would have made a nice football player on the inmates vs guards football game.  You can blame this on a good life of food and wine as part of the plus of being a special aid to the doctors and guards, but they only had that job for a maximum of four months, and it wasn't likely given to them the moment they stepped off the trains. This fact, combined with the use of the ""F"" distracted me from where I actually was. I was perhaps not in a concentration camp after all, but maybe a penal colony in the ""Aliens 3"" movie. That was the impression I got. The same type of shouting went on in the ""Alien 3"" movie as people tried to come up with a plan to kill the terrible creature that had acid for blood.  Both films had that same type of claustrophobic feel to it, and parts of both films could have been interchangeable. When I wasn't seeing the gas chamber or the ovens of Auschwitz, the dark sets could just as easily have been from some other futuristic metallic style space movie. Even The Jewish prisoners had a rough look to their faces that was not brought on by life at Auschwitz, but looked as if they belonged in some futuristic penal colony. The bottom line is that a prisoner in a Concentration Camp is still a prisoner, and the last thing he should be doing is threatening  the Camp's Commandant. You'd think. But it happens here with no reprisals. His body should reflect some degree of starvation, and his attitude should be one of greater submission. You'd think.
There is also in this film a great movie cliche that after all these years, Hollywood has never really learned how to deal with. Its the whole idea of two different races being able to communicate with each other quite easily--usually in English. You have to ask yourself in real life, how many Polish or Italian Jews took the time to actually learn German, and how many German soldiers actually took the time to learn Hebrew. For some reason, what Hollywood has done the most, and what is done here, is to give the English speaking German officer a German accent, so that he says, ""vork,"" instead of ""work."" This somewhat thankless job was given to actor Harvey Keitel--you may remember him from ""U-571"" as the First Officer. He was also the policeman in ""Thelma And Louise.""  Keitel does as good a job as can be hoped for, but why don't they give the actors playing Jews Jewish accents? The makers of this film spend so much time making Keitel sound German, while the very prisoners he is supposed to be in charge of look like they just came back from a big Thanksgiving dinner. You'd think there would be something someone could have done to thin them up a little bit--put fake rib cages on them, or something. There is kind of an imbalance here.
One question, the film asks, although not directly, is, ""what would you do?"" If you were sent to a concentration camp and given the cushy job of being a doctor's assistant would you take it? While your neighbors and friends are starving, you get the pick of the best meat, bread, and an entire bottle of wine for yourself. You also have minimal supervision. No slave labor work. Your only job description involves essentially lying to your fellow Jews. As they are being lead to the gas chamber, you tell them over and over that they are going to take a shower, and to remember where they hung their clothes, as they will need them after the shower. Or, as a doctor's assistant, you tell the patients that the doctor wants to examine them for general health, when you know full well he will be dropping acid in their eyes, or cutting off body parts without anesthesia as part of his human experiments. This was a big part of life in the Concentration Camps, and many Jews justified their behavior, as they would do anything to survive. Its part of what saves this film  from being a throw away.
If you want to watch a movie about the Holocaust, there are better films out there overall. But its hard to beat the scenes that depict the gas chamber, and the ovens. Its like nice prime rib dinner. You can enjoy the meat once you have sliced away the fat. But by then your 12 ounce steak is down to 7 ounces.",1057190400,4,7256,4.379080118694362
1116467,1,7538445226,"This DVD was a big disappointment, especially after having read such highly rated customer reviews. The quality of the DVD itself immediately takes away from the content. It claims to be Dolby Digital 5.1, however the sound quality is very poor. I had to turn the volume up so high, that speaker hiss was constantly present, just in order to make out what they were saying. I even went as far as to take the DVD to a local major name electronics store and ran it in several DVD players there....same problem... ... poor sound quality.
The story itself, especially the fact that it is true, should have made this a very compelling drama. The story is quite remarkable. However weak character introduction, bland acting, occasionally poor cinematography, unconvincing character portrayals, combined with the overall poor quality of sound, make this one a loser.
You will get a good laugh at Harvey Keitel's attempt at a German accent. Scenes where characters are supposed to be speaking Hungarian (but are speaking english), also detract from the film. For example, in one scene two camp members are speaking to the camp commadant's (Keitel's)....in German (which for the viewer's sake throughout the film is English....understandable). They then turn to each other and speak more in English, upon which Keitel yell's at them to speak German and not Hungarian. No time to teach the actors a few sentences for the scene in the native tounge of the character's they were portraying? This one has ""B"" movie stamped all over it.
The high reviews of this one make me wonder if anyone else who saw this has seen ""Schindler's List"" or the 1978 TV Mini-series ""Holocaust"" --> (which is supposed to be eventually re-released on DVD), or more recently ""The Pianist"".

1116469,4,7538445226,"Holocaust movies are very difficult to make and ""The Grey Zone"" goes a long way towards making a very authentic Holocaust film, but unfortunately it isn't very entertaining. The story of the Holocaust is one that I feel strongly needs to be told, but this film isn't the best vehicle for telling that story...
The film tells a story of the Auschwitz death camp and specifically of the Kommandos or work groups recruited from the Jews to run the camps. Most of the film shows the dismal lives of the work crews and their attempts to organize an uprising. Some other reviewers have criticized the film for events that seemed too outlandish to be true, but I can say after having read dozens of Holocaust books, spoken with survivors, and seen most of the film footage that survived the war that the stories all rang true for me. Among the stories was the tale of an old man who was recruited onto a work crew working the crematoriums who was forced to shovel the corpses of his own wife and family into the ovens. It's a gruesome story, but also a very true one.
The one ray of light in the film isn't the uprising, but the work crew's chance discovery of a little girl that survived the gassing. At great risk, the work crews hide the little girl and summon a Jewish prisoner doctor to revive her. He revives the little girl and they attempt to hide her indefinitely. The character of the doctor, Miklos Nyiszli, a Hungarian pathologist is both real and well known. He worked as Joseph Mengele's (a twisted man who used live human beings for medical experiments) assistant and was never able to function as a regular human being again. He survived the war. Without feeling that I'm ruining the movie for anyone, the work crew's attempts to save the girl were all for naught as was the attempted uprising. However, the prisoners and work crews were able to disable one of the crematoriums that the Nazis were never able to rebuild.
It's hard to say if the acting was good since we never really meet any of the characters and many of the characters names aren't mentioned until very late in the film. This may have been an intentional decision by the director, but it made it very hard to get to identify with any of the characters. The film has an impressive cast including David Arquette, Allan Cordunes, Harvey Keitel, Mira Sorvino, David Benzali, and Steve Buscemi. Harvey Keitel who isn't known for accents did a more-than-passing job as a German Nazi guard.
This film is based upon the play of the same name that Tim Blake Nelson wrote. When it played in New York it won numerous awards and received rave reviews. The play was based on the book ""Auschwitz"" by Doctor Miklos Nyiszli. The book is well written, but didn't survive the transition from book to play to film format well.
I gave this film four stars instead of five because of its' extremely slow plot, which I don't think could keep the attention of either a disinterested party or someone who hadn't heard of the Holocaust before. I gave it four stars instead of three because the film is truly memorable with a great musical score, good acting within limits, and a very poignant story.
I mildly recommend this film and suggest that ""Shindler's List"" would be a much better film to view to learn about the Holocaust.

1116472,5,7538445226,"THE GREY ZONE is the finest film yet made about the horrors of the Nazi Final Solution for the extermination of the Jews and other undesirables in the concentration/death camps such as Auschwitz and Birkenau.  While other movies about the Holocaust may be more accessible to the public at large and thus more apt to win Oscars, THE GREY ZONE is based upon hard facts and tells those facts in the most visually compelling and emotionally devasting manner imaginable.  Tim Blake Nelson directed and penned the screenplay based on his own play of the same name which in turn was based on the writings of camp survivor Dr Miklos Nyiszlis.  The title is descriptive on many levels: the constant darkness of the atmosphere around Auschwitz from the smoke and ash debris of the crematoriums, the different zones with the camp that designated the various levels of waiting for annhilation, and that zone (grey) between life (white) and death (black) that allowed some of the Jews to elect to be Sonderkommandos - workers who lead their own people to the showers, reassuringly taking their clothes, locking them in the gas chambers, then unloading the bodies onto carts to transport to the crematoriums where they actually had to place the corpses into the ovens and cart away the ashes after the burnings. As the 'desparation of doing anything for survival' makes the indvidual do the incomprehensible, so does this film explore how crushed were the minds of these fated men and women.
Nelson achieves a harrowing sense of reality by uncompromisingly showing all phases of life and death in the camps and he does this so successfully in his choice of terse taut dialogue, quiet voices, lingering images of eyes, and a pacing that seems as formidable as the facts at hand. He keeps the lighting, the atmosphere, the scoring, and the acting level at such a suffocatingly low key that the story becomes just that much more devastating.  He also has drawn superb performances from an outstanding cast: David Arquette is brilliant in his embodiment of all that is pitiful in the destiny of these events, Allan Cordunes is stunning as Dr Nyiszlis, Harvey Keitel IS the Nazi in control, and Mira Sorvino, David Benzali, and Steve Buscemi are equally superb.
The living memorial of this true story is that it tells of the only uprising of the Jews in the camps in a 1944 incident that managed to permanently destroy about half of the crematoriums in Auschwitz before that uprising ended in the mass execution of the perpetrators.  A case in point of the sensitivity of this film:  during the uprising the hauntingly beautiful ""Alto Rhapsody"" of Brahms is superimposed on the action - one of those inimitable moments of the marriage of arts as any ever captured on the screen.
This is a very fine film but it may not be one that everyone can tolerate seeing. It is extrememly vivid, it does not spare the eye, but it never stoops to sensationalism.

Buy this film if you can handle the subject matter, in which
everyone is morally tainted, but which is an evident labor of
love and commercially courageous because these kind of hyper-realistic holocaust films (and this takes place  entirely in Auschwitz - unlike Schindler's List or Sophie's

1116497,2,7538445226,"First off the story of ""The Grey Zone"" is interesting and the film is watchable. It is about the story of Sonderkommandos - a group of jews who do the ""dirty work"" in the concentration camps that are beneath the nazis in exchange for special privileges. However, this would have been a better movie in the hands more capable director.
What made ""Schindler's List"" and ""The Pianist"" so effective is that the violence was arbitrary, coldly casual and was over before you had a chance to really register what happened. Also there was always a ray of hope to counter-balance the atrocities making the audience care and fear that much more for the characters in those films.
Here the director pans over piles of dead bodies far too long, shows prisoners shovelling their deceased loved ones in furnaces in slow-motion with stoic expressions, and shoves the camera in the faces characters who clearly hate themselves. You can almost here Colonel Kurtz in ""Apocalypse Now"" saying ""The horror....the horror."" This is the first movie on the holocaust where I felt the violence was sensationalized. Almost completley removing the human element.
From the very beginning there is a tone of bleakness
and despair. With the exception of an awkwardly cast Harvey Kietel the acting is very strong and the ensemble is top notch. But when the characters are so full of self loathing, why should we care about them? All of the actors do it very well, but that is all they do and it keeps the film flat and in a monotone. There is no balance and ultimately you wind up waiting for the inevitable.
The film pontificates for close to two hours and you wind up asking yourself to what end? Yes, the holocaust was shocking and horrific. Yes, the nazis were terrible.

It does not flinch in showing the horror that existed in Auschwitz-Birkenau and particularly in the crematoria and gas chambers. This is the movie to show to those who claim ""the Holocaust never happened."" It may be horrifying in its portrayal of history. Let us hope by watching this movie that more Holocausts and genocides don't occur again.
I have been interested in the Sonderkommando and read all the same source materials that Tim Blake Nelson consulted for this film. Miklos Nyiszli's ""Auschwitz"" and ""Amidst the Nightmare of a Crime"" compiled by members of the Sonderkommando (and buried near the crematoria in Birkenau) were the main sources Nelson used. His film kept true to events in both books. Some may say this film is a horror fest. Let us not forget that the Holocaust and the Nazis were a horror fest.
David Arquette, Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi and Mia Sorvino all deliver Oscar worthy performances. They make the characters believable. Nelson did an exceptional job directing this. Keitel had an instrumental part in seeing that this picture was made. The whole cast worked for less to be sure this important picture was made.

If one had not ever read the book or studied the Holocaust this movie would be bad cinema at best. From the introduction to the ending trailer I was riveted to my seat. With one or two exceptions the movie follows the book, which in part is the story of Miklos Nyiszli, a Hungarian pathologist sent to Auschwitz where he believes he will work in a hospital.  Instead, he becomes the ""willing"" assistant of Josef Mengele, the chief Doctor of the death camp. The movie correctly centers around a plot to blow up the crematoria and thus thwart the nazi's fanatical killing of the Jewish people.  The acting is superb, albeit laced with profanities (yet could one expect civility in Auschwitz?).  The moral dilemma that Nyiszli faces when confronted with a victim of the gas that didn't die is amazing. This scene stretches out more than the book allowed, yet it showed the depths that men took to save the lot rather than the one. The ending trailer that chronicled the fate of Dr. Myiszli was very impressive to me...I have never found any information as to his whereabouts after the war.  I recommend this to any serious student of the Holocaust (but please read the book first).",1037059200,10,1283,4.663716814159292

The film focuses on the selected Jewish prisoners whom volunteered to work in the crematoriums, burning the hundreds of bodies and shoveling away the ash, and would lull the Jews just arriving that they were safe as they escorted them to the gas chambers. In exchange they are given various privileges. But realizing they have only four months to live before they are replaced, these men realizing they are already dead plan to destroy the crematorium, which haunts the souls of every one of them.
Tim Blake Nelson directs this film with sheer brilliance and delivers to the audience a film more powerful then ""Shindler's List"", ""The Killing Fields"" or ""Black Hawk Down"". The cast shines in this as well delivering the best performances ever from Mira Sorvino, Harvey Kietel, Steve Busemi and David Arquette (whom full well deserves a nomination for best actor!). The cinematography is haunting but not nearly as much as the make up or art direction that bring to life the true horrors of the concentration camps. The music is stunning and fitting throughout the whole film though most, including myself will be a bit to engage with the film to truly notice it until near the end when it is used in one of the most powerful scenes.
The Grey Zone is a highly intense film and is by no means a film that will offer any happiness or even joy to its viewers. Instead it allows us to experience the hopeless of those imprisoned hoping to find some way to find redemption. The violence is exceptionally strong and WILL disturb anyone with a sense of compassion in their body. The film is rated R for strong holocaust violence, language, and nudity.
By the ending of this film I found myself shaking from everything that I had seen and even unable to leave immediately from having been so stunned by the ending and all the horrors that transpired. While this offers no sense of hope it does offer the most gripping cinematic experience ever to grace the silver screen. By far the best film made this year or almost any other year.",1035849600,3,2151,4.648293963254593
7899881,1,7538445226,"Grey Zone is a movie dealing with an unbearable topic and yet it fails on so many levels, one of which is the amount of historic inaccuracy that is prevalent throughout the movie. If Steve Buschemi's character is supposed to be the kapo Kaminski, he fails hopelessly through his malevolent portrayal of a man who was one of the heads of the resistance. Kaminski was a man of character, kindness, caring with the ability to inspire men. If you doubt my words, read Filip Muller's memoir of his 3 years in the Sonderkommandos  and personally knew Kaminski. The scene in the ""changing rooms"" of a Sonder severely beating a man would not have happened. There were terrible scenes in the movie, that did - putting bodies in ovens, etc. But was this necessary? I would recommend most highly, the movie Son of Saul for a far better, understated and superb movie about the horror of the Sonderkommandos.",1526342400,,895,4.7006369426751595

7899883,5,7538445226,"An inspiring story of great bravery in the midst of hopelessness. Based on real-life events and very realistic. In the Auschwitz concentration camp; the Sonderkommando or special-command of Jewish men is assigned to gather and burn the bodies of gassed / murdered Jews, and to also mislead them into the gas chamber. This Sonderkommando is given abundant food and good lodgings. However, the SS gas each Sonderkommando  every 4-months and replaces it with a new group to keep their evil deeds secret. The Jewish men are told of this by other inmates. The Germans were burning up to a thousand bodies per-day, and thus, had a large number of ovens in several buildings. These Jewish men feel a deep guilt for their collaboration, and so, rather than wish to escape; they wish to blow-up the ovens and stop the killing of their Jewish brethren; at least for a while. It is interesting how they accumulate enough explosives to do the job, because it required a huge amount of explosives to destroy the brick buildings and steel ovens. The Jews also steal some guns. There will be no fuse, and thus, no chance for the Germans to foil the explosions. Will the men have the bravery to ignite an instant and huge bomb? Some of the men want to escape instead, but that is not the agreed upon plan. A desire to save the life of a young Jewish woman; places their entire operation at risk. The Jewish orchestra, which is a true event, plays a very beautiful melody as the Jews walk into the showers. The Gestapo and the SS employed heinous torture to get information from anyone they caught planning revolt. Will the captured persons talk under gruesome torture? Yes, it is a very depressing topic; very realistically done; however, it is a story of great courage and cleverness in a hopeless situation. The ovens were never rebuilt. However, it did not stop the SS, and the murder of the Jews continued. However, it was thousands, millions, of such seemingly little accomplishments of bravery, which accumulated to defeat the Nazis.",1525737600,,2023,4.763532763532764
