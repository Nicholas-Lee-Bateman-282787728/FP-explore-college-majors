7374153,1,B013W7LT9S,"Anthology of horror ... for nothing ... these brief histories ... they fall down in the illness... the sick and the vulgar thing ... put some effort and portray our rich folklor ... what a  disappointment ... where are the witches? the goblins? the weeping woman? the boogeyman? A real disgust... what a lack of brain... Mexico is not only... drug trafficking, raping, prostitution and stupid people ... this anthology is a real piece of garbage... This is not a horror is really bad taste... My copy was direct to the garbage ... where belongs this type of cheap entertainment...",1452384000,2,580,4.8
7374154,2,B013W7LT9S,"Checked out the YouTube clips first and thought would like it - and not bad but- after watching once, doubt will bother to re-watch.  Short stories and maybe it is a cultural variance - but found them falling flat and while was some gore, no scare of shock value or freaky-value to make them worth sitting through again - so if you like to collect multi-cultural films you might want it for your collection - just not a vehicle that translates well to an American audience.",1449964800,,473,4.5
7374155,4,B013W7LT9S,"Alright, I didn't buy this on Amazon, I bought it from Walmart.

As for the movie, it was really good and suspenseful. I don't see why or where someone could hate the movie. I mean, it wasn't better than VHS or ABCs Of Death, but it was pretty damn decent, gritty and raw.

So, if you love horror movies and and can appreciate the art of movies like VHS and ABCs Of Death, then you must buy this.",1448668800,,396,4.064102564102564

7374157,5,B013W7LT9S,"Excellent in every way, Horror Connoisseur's take note: this will be the best $8 bucks you'll spend this year! Amazingly unified in texture and tone, every segment is a rough gem to be treasured. Hauntingly beautiful images cast a feeling of menace and unease from the beginning to the bloody end. Well balanced between realism and the supernatural, time past and time present, this amazing film had me under its spell for the duration, ( including the final 18 minutes of credits, which I always enjoy especially for the music.) Highly recommended for true horror fans!",1447718400,5,570,4.947916666666667
7374158,2,B013W7LT9S,"I was very excited to see this.  Wound up being totally disappointed.  Most segments relied on shock value, and went out of the way to disgust the viewer.  No suspense, or true horror to be found in this movie.  Came off as boring and pretentious.  Some of what you get are scenes of child disembowment... rape of a woman by a forest troll, demon, whatever...A women gathering the menstrual blood of her sleeping sister...

I would have given this thing a one-star rating...but some of the cinematography was good.",1447459200,,514,4.719101123595506
7374159,4,B013W7LT9S,"This is a series of 8 horror stories from Mexico. Some contain supernatural elements, some do not. It claims to be 115 minutes long, but that includes about 18 minutes of end credit runs for 8 films. The films themselves range from 8 to 16 minutes in length.

All the episodes are in Spanish (or Mexican for you Trump supporters) and they have English subtitles. It seems the English ""whatever"" used as a slang answer has made its way into Mexico. The titles to each feature is shown at the end as titles can be plot spoilers. One film was mostly in black and white and another feature looked like an old drive-in film. I suspect they were both that way by design.

If you could take a 90 minute film and try to show the best features in 15 minutes, that is what about what you get. For instance, if you were to show FROM DUSK TO DAWN in 15 minutes, you would show the bar scene and everyone would be happy. I just happen to pick that out because the DVD cover is that of a stripper celebrating the DAY OF THE DEAD at a night club.

Some of the films include erotic scenes such as the seduction of an outlaw, and a woman being undressed while sleeping...by her sister.

Guide: F-bomb, sex, and nudity.  3 1/2 stars",1447027200,8,1214,4.260869565217392
7374160,1,B013W7LT9S,"Here are seven horror shorts that lack horror, premise, dialogue, even sound at times.

The whole collection is completely uninspired, the stories are poorly developed and executed.

While some of these can be saved due to an 'ok' photography, some just come short of everything, like high school projects. There's no heart on any of these.

My conclusion is that a couple of mexican rejects from 'ABC's of Death' decided to take matters in their own hands... Disaster ensues.

I must say I was very excited to watch this since I first heard of the project back in early 2014. Maybe that's why I'm being extra harsh.",1446854400,,616,4.728971962616822

8729003,1,B013W7LT9S,"Again, no English dub, no watch.

I'm not 100% opposed to watching movies subtitled.  I can't tell you how many countless Anime I watched subbed back in the day due to the limitations and format constraints of the time (VHS was only able to offer one audio track).  But once DVD's were introduced (then Blu-ray, streaming, et al), I find no excuse not to offer/create multiple language tracks in any territory studios provide movies in.  I do not want to divert my eyes from the cinematography to read lines of dialog.  And for those who don't mind this, and are so good at it that it doesn't take away from their movie watching experience, great for you.  You can consider yourself better than me.  I'll stick to my dubs, thank you.  And for those who feel I'm missing out on some great films due to a limited viewpoint, take comfort.  There are more movies out there than one can watch in a lifetime, other great movies, in English, or dubbed in English, and I'll spend my time watching those instead.  I'm entitled to my own opinion and preferences, and I'll continue to support film studios who demonstrate care for my enjoyment, providing English dubs.

Amazon needs to do a better job of labeling movies that only offer English subtitles with no dub.  They do so on some, but not on others; why?  One only has to read other similar reviews on countless movies on their site to see that this frustrates many of their customers, not just me.

As for the movie, if they make an English dub, or offer one in the future, I'll watch it and adjust my rating.  Until then, the one star is for Amazon's lack of clear labeling.",1494720000,,1623,4.491467576791809

8729005,4,B013W7LT9S,Seeing the horror film through the lens of a different culture was great fun. Now these vignettes are supposed to be related and they are but since I do not speak Spanish the connection is a bit vague.,1472947200,,201,4.315789473684211
8729006,1,B013W7LT9S,"I watched about half of it and decided that was quite enough, and I rarely ever not finish a movie. I read good things about the stories being well written and scary, but that's hardly what I saw in this pile of crap! The stories had no depth and nothing was explained in them. They do have plenty of sex scenes though! Maybe one day I'll go back and watch the rest of it if I decide I want to punish myself!",1470528000,,408,3.9878048780487805

And they showed that things penis being shoved in her face  I was watching this with my parents on Netflix, when this scene happened they turned to me like "" what did you put on?"" So embarrassing. There was a good reason why it had two stars on Netflix.  So disappointed I really thought watching eight Mexican horror stories would be fun. No there really disturbing and too weird to enjoy definitely not fun to watch. Skip this movie.",1461974400,2,548,4.415841584158416
