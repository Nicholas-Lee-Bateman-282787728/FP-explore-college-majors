8509706,5,B0074B2NC6,Terrific bargain..three shows for one low price!  I love musicals and plays filmed live on stage...I do not like those musicals that are filmed in Hollywood..because they are just not the same.  So this collection is a real treat for everyone of us who are Broadway fanatics.  The WEEKEND ON BROADWAY COLLECTION is a MUST HAVE!!!  Enjoy!,1383868800,,337,4.859649122807017
