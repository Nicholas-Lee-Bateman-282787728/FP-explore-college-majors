8351939,5,B000TS8M3U,This is a great addition to any soccer library and the best DVD I have seen about coaching techniques and tactics. The author has had 50 years of experience. I have coached for 21 years and found this very valuable. It would be a great tool to show all beginning and intermediate coaches.,1425340800,,288,4.452830188679245
8351940,4,B000TS8M3U,This DVD is a great introduction to coaching U9-U11 girls soccer. It covers a lot of ground in about an hour and breaks up the sections to make it easy for reference. I like the specific instruction for drills and coaching tips that are provided. I highly recommend this for new coaches at this level.,1220400000,,301,4.490909090909091
