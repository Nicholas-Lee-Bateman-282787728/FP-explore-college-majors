8756011,5,B01DJ636Y8,My daughter loves this DVD! Shes a Gabba fanatic. It plays perfectly and has newer episodes that aren't on the US released DVDs. Now to find season 4 episode 1. :) IMPORTANT: This is a region 4 (Australia) DVD so it will not play in your US (region 1) DVD player unless you have a region-free/multi-region DVD player.,1526428800,,317,4.482758620689655
