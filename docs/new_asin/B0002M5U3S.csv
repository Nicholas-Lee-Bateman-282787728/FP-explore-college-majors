8029196,5,B0002M5U3S,"From an historical perspective, this 2-disc, 4-sided collection is indispensable. The first teaming of L&H in Lucky Dog is outrageously funny, and Utopia is an underrated must-own for every L&H fan. Plus the audio is 5.1 Surround, and basically clear. Recommended!",1437264000,,264,5.463414634146342
8029197,2,B0002M5U3S,"A lot of silent comedies, many in very rough condition.  As a team, Laurel and Hardy are seldom seen.  None of their excellent two-reelers.",1178409600,,139,4.75
8029198,4,B0002M5U3S,"The highlights of this set are the Oliver Hardy silent solo films, Stans are out on better sets! ALL of these are on other DVDs except ""HARD BOILED EGGS"".  Now that the boys silent solo films are noticed by public domain companies, we will see multiple copies of the same shorts mixed in with one or two new shorts.

In most cases you can skip ""Side A"" of both discs, what few new to DVD titles there are will be on ""Side B"".  I keep the recorded A side (opposite side of the label) exposed in the DVD case, if any damage happens it won't matter.

For the price, it is good to have two good sides you will want to add to your collection.

Disc 1 Side A

UTOPIA - well everyone has this PD final feature film. Video scan lines make this inferior to Platinun Discs version.

Disc 1 side B

MUD AND SAND (1922) - Stan Laurel's parody of Rudolph Valentino's Blood & Sun. This is the complete 40 minute version, a nice copy from slightly contrasty 16mm print. Also available from ALPHA/GOTHAM and PASSPORT's LAUREL OR HARDY COLLECTION.

STAN LAUREL'S HOME MOVIES (25 minutes)- Since Stan shot these, he is rarely in them. This is mainly excellent footage of the boys' kids. There is no narration to tell you what you are watching and you will be hitting the fast forward button until Stan & Ollie appear again.  Also available from ALPHA/GOTHAM.

THE HOBO (1917) - Oliver Hardy & Billy West (impersonating Chaplin's Tramp). Made from a second or third generation video tape, scan lines are visible. Similar to the copy on ALPHA/GOTHAM and PASSPORT's LAUREL OR HARDY COLLECTION.

Disc 2 side A

WEST OF HOT DOG (1924) - Stan Laurel's spoof of West of Pecos. Forget this poor copy from a second generation videotape, watch the KINO STAN LAUREL COLLECTION version.

ORANGES & LEMONS (1923) - Stan Laurel as Sunkist, an orange picker. Forget this poor copy from a second generation videotape, watch the KINO STAN LAUREL COLLECTION version.

THE STOLEN JEWELS (1931) - L & H cameo in this all-star mystery short. Better than the other shorts on this side, but there is a better copy on the KINO FLYING DUECES (RESTORED) DVD.

TRIBUTE TO A STAR (original title: Ship's Reporter Interview With Oliver Hardy) (1950) - *New To DVD*.  4 minute interview, filmed for TV in 1950, with Oliver Hardy who promotes their upcoming reunion film ""ATOL-K"", now known as ""Utopia"".  This is a decent Copy from a worn print, the only thing worth watching on this side.

Disc 2 side B

Clip of LUCKY DOG (1917) - Stan Laurel's first encounter with Oliver Hardy (now on several DVDs).  The COMPLETE version is on HAL ROACH STUDIOS' THE LOST FILMS OF LAUREL & HARDY VOLUME 3 DVD.  It is a nice copy, but not necessary to have just a clip.

HOP TO IT BELLHOP (original title ""Hop To It"", 1925) - Oliver Hardy & Bobby Ray.  A contrasty print was used. There is a nice 35mm presentation on KINO's 'OLIVER HARDY COLLECTION' with original titles.

SAW MILL (1922) - Oliver Hardy & Larry Semon. A contrasty print was used. There is a nice 35mm presentation on KINO's 'OLIVER HARDY COLLECTION' DVD.

HARD BOILED EGGS (1926) - Oliver Hardy & Billy West. *New to DVD*. A contrasty print was used (could be the only thing existing), but it looks better than some of the others here.

THE TREE IN A TEST TUBE (1943) - Only L & H 4 minute sequence in color.  Looks like it was copied from KINO'S FLYING DUECES (RESTORED) DVD extras.",1109462400,10,3389,4.502454991816694
8029199,3,B0002M5U3S,"not a great collection of films, most are silent,most are not laurel and hardy together, but for the price, it is an interesting collection of shorts, home movies,their last feature film ""Utopia"", and a quick interview with mr.hardy. there's also a color documentary about plastic from 1943. the quality of the films vary but most are decent. worth owning to any l & h fan.",1094601600,13,373,4.753846153846154
