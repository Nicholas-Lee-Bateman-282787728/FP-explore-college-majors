6838914,5,B00PZ4PS26,"I purchased this DVD because I hurt my neck and was having a hard time finding a way to exercise. This more then exceeded my expectations. I was able to exercise without pain, it helped to decrease my pain during the day and to work thru the recovery stage. I really liked that I could do each section by itself or the whole DVD depending on how much time I had to dedicate to it. I could exercise at different levels: sitting in a chair, standing or just use the meditation section depending on how I felt at the time. The instructor's voice is very soothing and the instruction is clear and concise. I no longer have the injury but I still use it as part of my exercise and meditation practice. I find it to be a great compliment to my more intense practice on other days of the week.  I have also lent it to family members who were looking for a good introductory yoga class.",1422835200,3,878,4.226190476190476
6838915,5,B00PZ4PS26,"Whether a beginner, advanced practitioner or instructor, Gentle Yoga for Recovery and Beyond will have something for you. Camille Kittrell is a truly outstanding Yoga instructor.  If you aren't fortunate enough to live  where you can take her classes in person, this is the next best thing.  I've tried any number of Yoga classes where they supposedly had adaptive moves for those in recovery of some form or another. Sadly, no instructor had the depth of knowledge of human anatomy/physiology nor the effects of some treatments to understand what accommodations  a recovering patient truly needs.  Camille blows them all out of the water. Her soothing voice sets a calming ambience for one's yoga practice and sets a beautiful tone for recovery.  When I can't get to her class in person,  this disk is truly a gift.",1422835200,9,816,4.955882352941177
6838916,5,B00PZ4PS26,"Camille's teaching style is so calm and assuring. She is very knowledgeable about the interactions between movement and the body. This video is good for anybody, recovering from disease or just the stresses of living. Camille's instructions are easy to follow and she gives reasons for the postures and movements. Her voice and her presentation are firm, but gentle. I feel stronger and relaxed after practicing with Camille.",1422662400,6,425,5.264705882352941
6838917,5,B00PZ4PS26,I love this dvd. Camille is a really great yoga instructor. She makes it easy to understand and is careful not to push you too far. I always feel so good afterwards. I've taken classes before where teachers have pushed me too far and I have injured myself. You can tell Camille really knows what she is doing.,1421625600,2,309,4.344827586206897
6838918,5,B00PZ4PS26,"After viewing countless yoga DVDs and taking classes with a variety of instructors,  I can attest...hands down...Camille Kittrell is the best yoga instructor I have ever had.  Her transitions through different poses are thoughtful and reflect a movement flow created by a highly trained professional.  Camille has a unique style of augmenting her classes with informative direction, explaining why are you are doing something, not just how.

Whether you are in recovery, starting out in yoga, or an advanced yoga student, Camille's DVD has something everyone.  With a voice made for yoga instruction, she will guide you through a very productive and enjoyable yoga session.",1421539200,7,673,5.371428571428571
6838919,5,B00PZ4PS26,"I can't say enough about how great this DVD is.  It was the first yoga I did while undergoing Chemo and radiation therapy 6 years ago and I still find it helpful now.  Unlike other yoga DVDs  I've used, this one strikes a good balance between effort and relaxation.",1420761600,2,265,4.36734693877551
6838920,5,B00PZ4PS26,"I am an Occupational Therapist and was looking to add ""chair Yoga"" to the exercise classes that I was already teaching at senior housing. I was lucky enough to get private instruction from Camille in preparation for this class (she is a wonderful, extremely knowledgable instructor). I bought this tape to supplement my classes and used portions of it for my classes. My classes loved the yoga I added to my classes (all from the video). One of the great things about the tape is that it can be adapted to meet the needs of a variety of folks. There are sections for both seated and standing exercises-the standing ones can be adapted by having participants hold onto the back of a chair or standing at the kitchen sink. Camille is a warm, welcoming, instructor who gives clear directions for those using the tape for themselves or for teaching others.",1420416000,7,852,4.6866666666666665
6838921,5,B00PZ4PS26,"If I could, I would give this product 10 stars.
Camille is THE instructor to turn to for an instructional AND supportive video guide to move with you through your recovery process. She is one of the best informed cancer recovery educators and yoga therapists in the country. THIS DVD has been selected by the Mayo Clinic for use in their 2013-2014 study.

I first discovered her work when I went in search of the best yoga teacher specializing in cancer and recovery. This is what I learned: Camille is a frequent lecturer at Massachusetts General Hospital, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Lahey Clinic. She designs medical yoga programs for cancer recovery, heart disease and Parkinsons. Her workshop for the first national Medical Yoga Symposium in January 2014 was highly praised.

This DVD is beautiful ~ like sharing the day with your very best friendwho happens to be an articulate and compassionate expert in your recovery process!",1420416000,3,947,4.987341772151899
6838922,5,B00PZ4PS26,"Highly recommended for those new to yoga or old hands. Camille has a way of making you feel at ease right away; directions are clear but never jarring or startling. Somehow she makes you feel like a whole human being, not a syndrome or disease or ailment - you're just you, and these exercises can help you feel more like yourself. You can pick and chose which session you'd like to do - with ninety minutes to chose from. Treat yourself!",1420416000,3,438,4.419753086419753
8689855,5,B00PZ4PS26,very easy for a beginner and can increase levels easily,1496016000,,55,4.6
8689856,5,B00PZ4PS26,I have had 3 back surgeries and I have neverso I thought this may not be too hard for me. I was right. Not too hard ( but makes me feel much better each time I use it) but easy enough to use without hurting myself.,1485475200,,214,3.6739130434782608
8689857,5,B00PZ4PS26,Great tape would really recommend to anyone who needs yoga at a very slow pace,1485129600,,78,4.266666666666667
8689858,5,B00PZ4PS26,I bought this DVD because I'm currently teaching a chair yoga class and was looking for a few good ideas to supplement my sequences. What a lovely surprise to find such a great class that really provided a thorough workout. I did the entire series which took 1 1/2 hours and I was pleasantly pooped! This is a good one to keep on hand for when I'm snowed in or I just don't feel like doing a full standing series.,1484092800,,413,4.175
8689859,4,B00PZ4PS26,Great video.,1472342400,2,12,5.5
8689860,5,B00PZ4PS26,This helped to get me restarted on yoga after a long break and many years of not doing it.  It is gentle and  she is a wonderful guide.  I like that there are three levels within this DVD. I highly recommend it.,1467763200,3,211,3.9761904761904763
8689861,5,B00PZ4PS26,"I can't say enough good things about this video. It's well set up so that you can piece together a practice depending on what your mood is. As a longtime yoga practitioner, I had my doubts about how much I would get out of doing yoga in a chair (and what kind of yoga could be done in a chair). But as I was recovering from a mastectomy, I found her DVD just the right speed in terms of what my abilities were. Her vast knowledge of cancer survivorship and movement is readily apparent in her instructions - unlike other videos that never mention the challenges or contraindications of particular poses when you are recovering from surgery. After having done her video for a few weeks, I feel like I can trust and challenge my body again. If you are looking for a way to continue your yoga practice post surgery, look no further.",1465344000,5,829,4.3896103896103895
8689862,5,B00PZ4PS26,"I have been a student of Camille Kittrell's for over 20 years. She is a gifted, knowledgeable and devoted teacher. Camille's evolving skill set has helped me as I have transitioned through the stages of my life. My practice in yoga and meditation have grown and developed, and I am grateful
to Camille. Gentle Yoga for Recovery & Beyond allows Camille to share with others her passion of yoga, meditation and positive movement.
THANKYOU!!!",1430092800,,439,4.945945945945946
