7796956,1,1568553986,"""The Modocs were a scrappy little tribe...""  is a quote from this sappy, condescending, and offensive film.
As far as the geological information, it might have been okay for a junior high class, I suppose,  except that it would be too religious for public schools. You won't hear  the terms pyroclastic or stratovolcano, but you will hear again and again,  ""angels, hell, god, heavens, goddess, sacred etc...""
As a  student of geology, I found this tape nearly a complete waste of time.  The  only thing good about it is the spectacular pictures of the major volcanoes  in the United States.  But, if you're looking for indepth information on  volcano systems, plate tectonics, or geology, try another source.  This is  not going to give you anything to chew on.
And, as an American Indian,  this tape is beyond condescending. Again and again you hear what the Native  Americans called each volcano - as if there's some mystical power in that.  If only the poor white men would have just listened to the noble  savages.
Please!  That's what I get for thinking that the most expensive  tape offered by Amazon.com on volcanoes is going to be the best.  Rob  Lightner, did you really watch this?",927763200,4,1192,4.778325123152709
