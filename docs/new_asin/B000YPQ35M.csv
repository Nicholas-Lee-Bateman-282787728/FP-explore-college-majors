3034091,5,B000YPQ35M,"I love Tracey's 6 Minute Quick Blast Method DVDs.  The workouts are challenging but only six minutes long.  Each segment works the total body, so you really feel it even though it's only 6 minutes.  I like how the DVD is set up so that you can pick the segments you want to do.  I mix it up and do about 3-6 segments each day.  When I have more time, I do more; when I have less time, I do less.  But I always have time to do at least 1 or 2 segments.  I also really enjoyed meeting Team Mallett.  Doing the workouts with real women who aren't professional fitness experts, but people just like me, is really inspiring.  Hearing about their successes makes me want to keep going.  Get the book and the DVDs.  You won't be sorry.",1200268800,5,728,4.128571428571429

3034095,5,B000YPQ35M,"These Quick Blast DVDs that go with the Tracey Mallett Sexy in Six book are so fabulous!  All of the exercises are in the book, but it is so much easier to follow along with Tracey and Team Mallett on the DVDs.

The 2 I mentioned however, are very good, and buying them separately saves you $18 from if you bought the 4 disc set. Trust me, there is a HUGE quality difference in the 4 dvds included. Do not waste your money on the set.

Here is my review just for the Total Body Fat Burner dvd:

I got this dvd as part of a 4 dvd set of Tracey Mallett's QuickBlast Method workouts. I tried the Rock Hard Abs & Buns and the Dancer's Body dvds before this one (both also part of the set) and was very disappointed in those two, and therefore not too hopeful when trying this. However, I was pleasantly surprised. This is leagues above the others and a solid workout.

The dvd is obviously aimed at those who have limited time in their day and particularly mothers. It's made up of a series of 6 minute segments and everyone demonstrating the workout with Tracey on the dvd is a woman who supposedly lost weight from Tracey's method (and all but one or two are mothers who wanted to lose baby weight and are very busy). They are all in average shape, versus most workouts where they are all in excellent shape. This is probably a positive for some people and a negative for others. As for me, it was somewhat discouraging seeing people in worse shape than me doing the exercises, knowing they've been on the program for 6 weeks. However, none of them are in bad shape and some of them had lost a significant amount from the program (I believe the highest was around 80 pounds).

Tracey recommends doing 3 or so segments a day, fitting them in whenever you can (e.g. 6 min. in a.m., 6 in afternoon, 6 in evening). I like doing the entire dvd in one sitting, which ends up being about an hour. The dvd offers a couple of recommended weekly combinations (programmed in as selections you can play) with 3 or 4 different segments for each day of the week. You can also choose to play a 6 min. segment individually. You can not customize a selection of several segments to play in a row.

The 10 segments are as follows: Warm-up, 3 Lower Body/Cardio segments, 4 Upper Body segments, Ab Blast, and Cool down/stretches. The upper body and ab segments all use a stability ball and the upper body segments also use 2 sets of weights (3 and 5 lb or 5 and 8 lb recommended).

The warm-up is essentially variations on walking. Very basic and didn't do much to really warm me up. I was hesitant at this point in terms of how much I would like the workout. (And if she said ""sexy"" one more time during the warm-up I probably would have turned it off). Thankfully it got much better.

The lower body and upper body segments are each made up of 2 minute circuits that are repeated 3 times each to make up the 6 minutes. Each circuit has 3 or 4 moves. I found this 2 min. circuit approach to be effective but just a bit boring. Granted, you're only going for 6 minutes at a time (not long enough to squeeze in too much variation OR for it to get too boring), but it's not exactly exciting to repeat each set 3x. There is a countdown clock on the bottom of the screen, which I liked. Each segment works different areas of the lower and upper body which is important to me since I normally do the entire dvd in one workout and wouldn't want to be working one muscle group repeatedly in all of the different segments. For me, each of the main segments was a good intensity level. They were not too easy, but not challenging to the point where I got discouraged or felt like I had to stop. I felt the burn in each muscle group and the lower body segments offered a decent cardio workout as well (the first two more than the third).

The abs section on the ball isn't terribly difficult though it's a nice change from the standard mat work ab exercises. A couple of the moves challenged my balance a bit, but all were doable. This segment is also about 6 minutes but is not done in the 2 minute circuit format. It is a series of different ab exercises that are done once and then not repeated again.

The cool down segment is 4 minutes and offers some basic stretches, nothing I haven't seen before. It's fairly standard.

Tracey's personality will appeal to certain people, and less so to others. She's very encouraging, versus demanding/pushing, and quite peppy and cheery. This is a good workout dvd for ALL levels (though I'd say it's most aimed at advanced beginners), especially those who like shorter segment workouts or new mothers who need a bit of encouragement.",1300838400,6,5533,4.908021390374332
3034108,5,B000YPQ35M,"I LOVE this DVD! It's great for anyone, especially those tight on time. She works your entire body simultaneously to cut on time but maximize calorie burning and muscle toning. I can't believe how much I sweat in a 6 minute segment!! I really appreciate the flexibility in the program. She has 2 sets of weekly workout plans so you can pick and choose which areas you'd like to focus on. Or you can just pick any 6 minute segment to get a quick boost or get an ab routine in. The book is even more helpful with more exercises and nutrition advice, along with encouraging testimonials. She's cheerful and her accent is cute. I used to hate working out, I would always feel frustrated during and after so I would stop for several months. With Tracey's workouts, I find exercising fun and I actually look forward to it!!",1271894400,,817,4.489932885906041
3034109,5,B000YPQ35M,"This is a great DVD. You have 3 6 minute sessions (A, B, and C) a warm up and a cool down. You don't have to do the warm up and cool down unless you really want to - most of the time I will skip one and do the other if i'm pressed for time.

Although it's only 6 minutes you are working hard for those 6 minutes and your heart rate will get up and you will sweat.  I have this DVD as well as the 6 minute upper and lower body blast DVDs. I rotate them weekly so I don't get bored or plateau.",1269993600,,491,3.5794392523364484
3034110,3,B000YPQ35M,"I hate to be the odd one out but I tried this dvd after reading all the 5 star reviews and was disappointed. This is my first Tracy Mallett dvd - my current favorites are Tanja Djelevic, the Core Fusion series, and I just tried Jari Love which is awesome.

I don't consider myself to be a particularly advanced exerciser, but I didn't find the 6 minute workouts very challenging, especially the upper body.  I suppose I need to use heavier weights (I used 5 and 8 pounds as recommended for advanced exercisers). I had to string together quite a few segments to make a decent workout.  In addition the production value is low - the music is awful! Instead of compelling music, there is constant chatter and giggling from Tracy which I found pretty annoying. She's trying to be motivating but it didn't work for me (though it's impressive that she can chit chat about trivia absolutely NONSTOP through all the exercises without getting out of breath!).  Finally, I know some people like to see ""normal"" people in these videos, but I like to see people that are in really good shape.  The background cast is definitely made up of real, non-professional exercisers, but it's discouraging to see people that have been doing this program for six weeks and look like they're in worse shape than I am - it doesn't provide alot of incentive to stick with it!

I think this program is targeted mainly for beginners, and for people that are having trouble staying motivated to exercise. If you're already serious about exercise there are more professional trainers out there to work with in my opinion.

Note: I continued to give this one a try and did it a few more times. I've finally had to put it away for good. Tracy's cheerleading just doesn't work for me. Its very, well Richard Simmons. Now those were very popular videos so that really works for some people, but not for me.  She shouts things like ""this really works your booty so you can wear that bikini bottom!""  I'd prefer something more low key like ""you should be feeling this in your glutes right now.""  If it was a really fantastic workout I'd just put her on mute and do it anyway, but there's nothing really outstanding about it.  The notion that you can exercise for only 6 minutes a day is just plain silly - she mentions briefly at one point that you should do more than one segment if you have time, but the DVD doesn't really go into any detail about this. I'm assuming the book that goes with this DVD talks more about the appropriate length of time for working out.",1266969600,15,2531,4.5285087719298245
3034111,5,B000YPQ35M,This is a very good workout.  If I am not in a hurry I do the whole DVD and I really like it.  I do only cardio segments when I am short in time.  So far I am very pleased with the workout and results.,1259798400,,201,3.422222222222222

3034115,4,B000YPQ35M,"The beauty of this video is that it can be done in segments of 6 minutes.  You can tailor it to meet your busy schedule.  Even if you don't have an entire hour to exercise, you can break it into 6 minute segments and achieve your goal.  You can also tailor the program daily to work the parts of the body that you choose. The exercises range from easy to a bit more challenging if you haven't exercised in awhile.",1237420800,2,413,4.1375
3034116,4,B000YPQ35M,"The first 3 segments are cardio, the next 3 are yoga/pilates and then there is an ab workout. The routines were not too complicated to do, but they were challenging. I definitely got a good workout.",1236988800,7,198,4.527777777777778
3034127,5,B000YPQ35M,"I've always had the issue of not having time to really work in exercise.  I would try to do 15 minutes but what I was doing would hardly get my heart rate up enough to begin to try to work a sweat.

Not so with Tracey! I can accomplish more in 6 minutes than I used to in 15-20 minutes.  The mix of cardio and strength is great and really easy to follow.

I've been using the DVD for about 2 weeks straight now and feel great and have lost 11lbs (coupled with eating better of course)!

Overall this is a great money investment for those using the time commitment as an excuse or reason for not exercising.",1234742400,6,606,4.101694915254237
3034128,5,B000YPQ35M,"I honestly felt skinny after my first workout from this DVD.  I found the workout sensible but challenging, easy to follow and very motivating.  My metabolism got a huge boost from a 40-minute workout.  Even though it's an awesome DVD, I don't think it's for everybody.  It is probably most suitable for someone who has been workingout for a while and has done some Pilates & Yoga.",1231718400,4,381,4.641791044776119
3034129,5,B000YPQ35M,"This DVD is full of short sections that work on there own to get your cardio going or can be extended for those times you have time for longer workouts.  Though I know you are suppossed to get your heart rate up for longer than 6 minutes, I figure doing any cardio on days that I do not have time is better than none, plus I can usually do 6 minutes but longer workouts can be a bit taxing.

Does a nice job of working all parts of your body for good overall toning and strengthening.",1231113600,3,484,4.03125
3034130,5,B000YPQ35M,I love this series of Tracey's. After my second child 4 months ago i was wondering how i would get back in shape? This DVD is the answer!

I would recommend this and her other dvd and book to all levels of fitness!,1230422400,2,344,3.9285714285714284
3034131,5,B000YPQ35M,"I got this DVD after I had been working out pretty regularly (but not vigorously) for about a year. Before I started my workout regime, I had two kids, turned 40 and had gotten a bit soft. I had also gained 10 pounds, but lost 5 of those pounds during the year. The last five pounds did not budge. I got this DVD and it really does help. It was easy to keep adding another 6 minute blast and soon was able to fit in a good 30 minute work out felt great. The 5 pounds have finally been shed!
I'm stronger and in better shape thanks to this work out.

Well, this one is one of those. I had tried a couple of older videos with Tracy and didn't like them at all. So, I was hesitant with this one, but couldn't ignore all of the 5-star reviews. I'm glad I didn't. This workout (playing all) is pretty intense, and I admit I used much heavier weights than Tracy and her team, but it was a blast. I felt completely worked out in a good way. What I also really liked is that she always did a group of 3 exercises and then repeated them 3 times. So, if you didn't get it right, or the weight was too light the first time you could then adjust it in the next 2 sets. Awesome workout!!!",1226102400,4,796,4.044303797468355

They are short segments so they are easy to do and the entire workout is geared for intermediate exercisers, although the cardio segments can be a little tough.  It's so good if you are short on time and the way it's all put together makes your workout very effective.  You will work your entire body with this dvd and my favourite segment is the ab work.
Tracey is a great instructor; she makes this easy to follow and very doable.  I love the fact that you can do as much or as little as you have time for and that you can do things in any order you'd like.

The workout is great because she works several different muscle groups at once and changes the exercises constantly.  What I like best about the video is that she changes it up from cardio to weights every minute or so which allows you to completely change your focus and keep you interested.  I've lost 10 pounds using this video in combination with Tracey's food plan from her Sexy in Six book and am now down to the weight that I was before getting married!!

When I only have a few moments to myself I can get a great quick workout in...or if I have more time I can do all of them at once, or any combination in between! You still know you've accomplished something great for yourself regardless of how long your workout is.

The sections are all joined together so it's not all choppy, it feels very continious not like some short workouts where there is a break in between each section.
The video has it all cardio circuit training, Pilates for the core and yoga to stretch.... nice combination!

3034154,5,B000YPQ35M,"This is my first review I write about a fitness DVD, although I have nearly 50 DVDs at home. I am a perfectionist - I can't say it in other words - and my workouts need to be perfect. Most DVDs are unbalanced (for example too much biceps, no triceps) or the intensity moves from extremly high to boring in the same session.
Well, I'm lucky because I found the perfect workout for me! Tracey's workouts couldn't be better.
First I was very sceptical because of the length. How can I get a good workout in 6 minutes? It is possible! You will sweat, your muscels will burn! Big promise.
I mix an match both DVDs and train 24 minutes a day, 6 days a week. The effects on my body are dramatic. I am so happy, that I found a way to get fit, although I am a busy mother of a three years old daughter. My abs look better than before my pregnancy and I feel fantasic!
I also love Tracey's book.  It's like your best friend is talking to you and tells you every secret about nutrition and training you always wanted to know. Tracey is very likeable, friendly, and honest. ... and I assume she is a perfectionist as well :-)  Thank you Tracey!",1211414400,23,1132,4.1880733944954125

I am a perfectionist - I can't say it in other words - and my workouts need to be perfect. Most DVDs are unbalanced (for example too much biceps, no triceps) or the intensity moves from extremly high to boring in the same session.

The exercises are tough enough that you feel like you are really accomplishing results, but they don't leave you exhausted and sore - things that would make you not want to do it again the next day.

Following Tracey's guidelines in her book and the two videos have helped me accomplish great results in less than 30 minutes each day.  Before this, I thought I had to work out for an hour a day to get results, and always ended up quitting any program I started as I just couldn't commit to that kind of time each day.

3034161,5,B000YPQ35M,"Most times, fitness DVDs with short workouts are focused on one specific body part so that you have string together an hour's worth of segments to get any workout at all. Not so with this one.

The choreography/routines are basic, but the pace is quick. A beginner can follow it easily, but an intermediate may be more comfortable for the duration. The exercises she's chosen are very time-efficient, never boring, and can be done in a limited amount of space. Tracey's accent is very subtle and not at all distracting. (I had that problem with Lisa Kay's Southern drawl, Denise Austin's Texas twang, and Keli Roberts' Aussie accent.) Her cuing is excellent,and her encouragement is motivating rather than perky.

If you have the book, you'll recognize the segment titles. This DVD contains:

Warm-up
Quick Cardio Total Body Blast A
Quick Cardio Total Body Blast B
Quick Cardio Total Body Blast C

Quick Mind-Body Blast A
Quick Mind-Body Blast B
Quick Mind-Body Blast C

Quick Abs Blast
Cool-down

All the segments are 6 minutes, except for the warm-up and cool-down which are 15 each. There are two recommended pre-programmed week-long routines, or you can choose segments individually.

You'll need a pair of 3-5 pound weights and - since the cardio is mixed impact - I'd also recommend a good sports bra for the ladies.",1204848000,25,1322,4.901345291479821

The 2 I mentioned however, are very good, and buying them separately saves you $18 from if you bought the 4 disc set. Trust me, there is a HUGE quality difference in the 4 dvds included. Do not waste your money on the set.

Here is my review just for the Total Body Fat Burner dvd:

I got this dvd as part of a 4 dvd set of Tracey Mallett's QuickBlast Method workouts. I tried the Rock Hard Abs & Buns and the Dancer's Body dvds before this one (both also part of the set) and was very disappointed in those two, and therefore not too hopeful when trying this. However, I was pleasantly surprised. This is leagues above the others and a solid workout.

The dvd is obviously aimed at those who have limited time in their day and particularly mothers. It's made up of a series of 6 minute segments and everyone demonstrating the workout with Tracey on the dvd is a woman who supposedly lost weight from Tracey's method (and all but one or two are mothers who wanted to lose baby weight and are very busy). They are all in average shape, versus most workouts where they are all in excellent shape. This is probably a positive for some people and a negative for others. As for me, it was somewhat discouraging seeing people in worse shape than me doing the exercises, knowing they've been on the program for 6 weeks. However, none of them are in bad shape and some of them had lost a significant amount from the program (I believe the highest was around 80 pounds).

Tracey recommends doing 3 or so segments a day, fitting them in whenever you can (e.g. 6 min. in a.m., 6 in afternoon, 6 in evening). I like doing the entire dvd in one sitting, which ends up being about an hour. The dvd offers a couple of recommended weekly combinations (programmed in as selections you can play) with 3 or 4 different segments for each day of the week. You can also choose to play a 6 min. segment individually. You can not customize a selection of several segments to play in a row.

The 10 segments are as follows: Warm-up, 3 Lower Body/Cardio segments, 4 Upper Body segments, Ab Blast, and Cool down/stretches. The upper body and ab segments all use a stability ball and the upper body segments also use 2 sets of weights (3 and 5 lb or 5 and 8 lb recommended).

The warm-up is essentially variations on walking. Very basic and didn't do much to really warm me up. I was hesitant at this point in terms of how much I would like the workout. (And if she said ""sexy"" one more time during the warm-up I probably would have turned it off). Thankfully it got much better.

The lower body and upper body segments are each made up of 2 minute circuits that are repeated 3 times each to make up the 6 minutes. Each circuit has 3 or 4 moves. I found this 2 min. circuit approach to be effective but just a bit boring. Granted, you're only going for 6 minutes at a time (not long enough to squeeze in too much variation OR for it to get too boring), but it's not exactly exciting to repeat each set 3x. There is a countdown clock on the bottom of the screen, which I liked. Each segment works different areas of the lower and upper body which is important to me since I normally do the entire dvd in one workout and wouldn't want to be working one muscle group repeatedly in all of the different segments. For me, each of the main segments was a good intensity level. They were not too easy, but not challenging to the point where I got discouraged or felt like I had to stop. I felt the burn in each muscle group and the lower body segments offered a decent cardio workout as well (the first two more than the third).

The abs section on the ball isn't terribly difficult though it's a nice change from the standard mat work ab exercises. A couple of the moves challenged my balance a bit, but all were doable. This segment is also about 6 minutes but is not done in the 2 minute circuit format. It is a series of different ab exercises that are done once and then not repeated again.

The cool down segment is 4 minutes and offers some basic stretches, nothing I haven't seen before. It's fairly standard.

Tracey's personality will appeal to certain people, and less so to others. She's very encouraging, versus demanding/pushing, and quite peppy and cheery. This is a good workout dvd for ALL levels (though I'd say it's most aimed at advanced beginners), especially those who like shorter segment workouts or new mothers who need a bit of encouragement.",1300838400,6,5533,4.908021390374332
3268605,5,B000YPQ35M,"I LOVE this DVD! It's great for anyone, especially those tight on time. She works your entire body simultaneously to cut on time but maximize calorie burning and muscle toning. I can't believe how much I sweat in a 6 minute segment!! I really appreciate the flexibility in the program. She has 2 sets of weekly workout plans so you can pick and choose which areas you'd like to focus on. Or you can just pick any 6 minute segment to get a quick boost or get an ab routine in. The book is even more helpful with more exercises and nutrition advice, along with encouraging testimonials. She's cheerful and her accent is cute. I used to hate working out, I would always feel frustrated during and after so I would stop for several months.

3268607,3,B000YPQ35M,"I hate to be the odd one out but I tried this dvd after reading all the 5 star reviews and was disappointed. This is my first Tracy Mallett dvd - my current favorites are Tanja Djelevic, the Core Fusion series, and I just tried Jari Love which is awesome.

I don't consider myself to be a particularly advanced exerciser, but I didn't find the 6 minute workouts very challenging, especially the upper body.  I suppose I need to use heavier weights (I used 5 and 8 pounds as recommended for advanced exercisers). I had to string together quite a few segments to make a decent workout.  In addition the production value is low - the music is awful! Instead of compelling music, there is constant chatter and giggling from Tracy which I found pretty annoying. She's trying to be motivating but it didn't work for me (though it's impressive that she can chit chat about trivia absolutely NONSTOP through all the exercises without getting out of breath!).  Finally, I know some people like to see ""normal"" people in these videos, but I like to see people that are in really good shape.  The background cast is definitely made up of real, non-professional exercisers, but it's discouraging to see people that have been doing this program for six weeks and look like they're in worse shape than I am - it doesn't provide alot of incentive to stick with it!

I think this program is targeted mainly for beginners, and for people that are having trouble staying motivated to exercise. If you're already serious about exercise there are more professional trainers out there to work with in my opinion.

Note: I continued to give this one a try and did it a few more times. I've finally had to put it away for good. Tracy's cheerleading just doesn't work for me. Its very, well Richard Simmons. Now those were very popular videos so that really works for some people, but not for me.  She shouts things like ""this really works your booty so you can wear that bikini bottom!""  I'd prefer something more low key like ""you should be feeling this in your glutes right now.""  If it was a really fantastic workout I'd just put her on mute and do it anyway, but there's nothing really outstanding about it.  The notion that you can exercise for only 6 minutes a day is just plain silly - she mentions briefly at one point that you should do more than one segment if you have time, but the DVD doesn't really go into any detail about this.

Not so with Tracey! I can accomplish more in 6 minutes than I used to in 15-20 minutes.  The mix of cardio and strength is great and really easy to follow.

I got this DVD and it really does help. It was easy to keep adding another 6 minute blast and soon was able to fit in a good 30 minute work out felt great. The 5 pounds have finally been shed!

I'm glad I didn't. This workout (playing all) is pretty intense, and I admit I used much heavier weights than Tracy and her team, but it was a blast. I felt completely worked out in a good way. What I also really liked is that she always did a group of 3 exercises and then repeated them 3 times. So, if you didn't get it right, or the weight was too light the first time you could then adjust it in the next 2 sets. Awesome workout!!!",1226102400,4,796,4.044303797468355

They are short segments so they are easy to do and the entire workout is geared for intermediate exercisers, although the cardio segments can be a little tough.  It's so good if you are short on time and the way it's all put together makes your workout very effective.  You will work your entire body with this dvd and my favourite segment is the ab work.
Tracey is a great instructor; she makes this easy to follow and very doable.

What I like best about the video is that she changes it up from cardio to weights every minute or so which allows you to completely change your focus and keep you interested.

The 6 Minute Quick Blast Method is fantastic.  With a lot of variety in the exercises and options to customize the workout based on what you feel like doing that day (e.g., focus on upper body, more on abs, more on lower body, or more total body), you never get bored with it.

The choreography/routines are basic, but the pace is quick. A beginner can follow it easily, but an intermediate may be more comfortable for the duration. The exercises she's chosen are very time-efficient, never boring, and can be done in a limited amount of space. Tracey's accent is very subtle and not at all distracting. (I had that problem with Lisa Kay's Southern drawl, Denise Austin's Texas twang, and Keli Roberts' Aussie accent.) Her cuing is excellent,and her encouragement is motivating rather than perky.

Warm-up
Quick Cardio Total Body Blast A
Quick Cardio Total Body Blast B
Quick Cardio Total Body Blast C

Quick Mind-Body Blast A
Quick Mind-Body Blast B
Quick Mind-Body Blast C

Quick Abs Blast
Cool-down

All the segments are 6 minutes, except for the warm-up and cool-down which are 15 each. There are two recommended pre-programmed week-long routines, or you can choose segments individually.

Even though I wasn't doing the exercises quite as fast as Tracey Mallett I still felt like I got an excellent workout. I did the entire workout all at once instead of just 6 minutes a day. There is a warm up and a cool down stretch segment as well. You can choose which workouts you want to do or do them all in a row. Also you don't have to have a ball if you know how to modify the exercises. You will probably get a better workout if you have one as then you'll add a balance challenge to all the exercises. So I'd recommend this to intermediate exercisers. I used 5-lb weight the whole time but you can use 3-lb weights on some of the exercises if you prefer.

8233706,5,B000YPQ35M,I'm totally loving Tracey's workouts.  I have three of her DVD's and work them into my busy schedule.  I would Definitely recommend anyone trying them.  There not hard exercises but you know in 6 minutes that you have done a great and effective routine.,1367539200,,253,4.704545454545454

8233708,5,B000YPQ35M,"Tracey does a great job keeping you motivated, and since the options are 6 minutes, it doesn't make me so exhausted that I can't finish the set, which I think is great!",1355097600,,168,4.28125
8233709,5,B000YPQ35M,"Love this DVD!! I am almost 5 months pregnant with a 20 month toddler, so i love the 6 minute exercises. Time is a challenge for me, so this has been a great DVD for me. Actually love all of Tracy's DVD's she so inspiring and enjoyable.",1335139200,,236,4.042553191489362
8233710,4,B000YPQ35M,"I got this dvd as part of a 4 dvd set of Tracey Mallett's QuickBlast Method workouts. This is the last dvd in the set that I tried. In my opinion her Rock Hard Abs & Buns and the Dancer's Body dvds are MUCH lower quality than both this dvd and the Fat Burning dvd, which are much better. Total Body Calorie Blast offers a fairly strong workout.

The dvd is most geared toward those who don't have a lot of time to commit to long workouts and especially women. This dvd features the same cast as her Fat Burning dvd... they are all women (90% of them mothers) who supposedly lost weight using Tracey's method. They are all in average shape. I like that each of the 6 minute sections has a countdown shown on the screen to see how far you've progressed and how much you have left. I find it motivating.

The dvd segments are as follows: Warm-up, 3 ""Total Body Blast"" segments (cardio & weights), 3 ""Mind-Body Blast"" segments (yoga, pilates, core), Ab Blast, and Cool down/stretches. Each section is 6 minutes long except the warm up and cool down which are a little shorter but still 4/5 minutes each. You can do one at a time, string them all together for almost an hour long workout, or do one of the many pre-programmed routines which come from 2 suggested week-long practices. I like doing the whole thing but wish there was a convenient way to mix up the order of the sections. Required equipment includes a set of weights (I used 5 lbs).

The warm-up is exactly the same as on her Fat Burner dvd and essentially variations on walking. It's very basic and didn't do much to really warm me up. In the future I will most likely skip this altogether. It went on for 5 minutes.

The Total Body Blast segments are easy to pick up but fast paced. Each section starts off with some cardio, moves on to a segment with weights, does a 1 minute ""intensity blast"" (more intense cardio where one move is repeated the entire time), an additional segment with weights, and sometimes more cardio. All in 6 minutes. I enjoy these sections more than those on her Fat Burner dvd because you do different moves the entire time, rather than repeated circuits. I also like how for the one-minute ""intensity blasts"" she changes direction of the movement or does little things to keep it somewhat more interesting than doing say, stationary jumping jacks for the whole minute. What I like about these Total Body Blast sections is that even though each individual move is easy to follow and execute, moving so quickly from one thing to the next really gets your heart rate up. And it's nice to have a mix of cardio and weights.

The Mind-Body blast sections are definitely different from the Body Blast sections. Here she slows it down. The first section is pure yoga. Basic, easy stretching anyone could do. The second section is pilates and includes all mat work strengthening exercises. The third section is core strengthening, again on the mat. I enjoyed these sections, although the yoga one was almost too basic for my liking. While these are a nice change of pace from the Body Blast sections, I wish the whole dvd were set up alternating the Body Blast and Mind-Body Blast routines to provide a nice interval training and keep it more interesting if you were to do the entire workout in one session.

Next there's an ab section which I found fairly simple compared to ab sections on other workouts. She provides nice instruction throughout though regarding breath and form. Finally, there's a cool down/stretch segment which I believe is also directly from the Fat Burner dvd. It is fairly standard.

I'm not too fond of Tracey's personality, though I think many would love her. She's VERY cheery and peppy and I don't particularly care for her accent (British?). Just a matter of taste. She certainly, however, provides good instruction, both in terms of tips/pointers and cuing. This dvd provides a solid overall workout.",1302134400,7,3910,4.61726618705036
