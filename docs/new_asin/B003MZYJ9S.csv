8400561,5,B003MZYJ9S,"I have seen this video several times online at the halos website... finally got it in DVD form! One of my favorite science videos. This DVD is GREAT for people who are pondering if the universe was some cosmic accident, and also gives insight for people who think the earth was cooling slowly over millions of years.

Gentry has published his findings in major scientific journals, and they have passed peer review for decades. This work has remained unchallenged, and it has never been refuted by the scientific community. The implications of the halos in Granite rocks is very strong evidence of an instant, recent creation. The presentation is very easy to follow and gives the viewer several analogies that illustrate certain scientific principles. The other videos by Gentry like ""The Center of The Universe"" and ""The Young Age of The Earth"" are also a must see.

3 thumbs up!!!",1368057600,,883,4.88
