  ""Vanilla Sky"" is a rare type of film which stands by itself.  This quote is fairly apropos  ""The film has been described as ""an odd mixture of science fiction, romance and reality warp"".""  {Look it up on/at Wikipedia}  ""Vanilla Sky"" is a definite '5' star for some and a '0' to a '1' for others.  This would totally be based on how the viewer handles the plot, pace, and cerebral requirements.  ""Vanilla Sky"" requires thinking and attention!  So, if you've had a hard week and need to relax, go for ""The 3 Stooges"".
  ""Vanilla Sky"" is about a guy that has everything.  His problems are that there are some people that wish to take it all away from him.  And misfortune takes away other things.  Then ""Vanilla Sky""  takes us to a point where we start to notice things are appearing different.  But like watching a really good magician; we want to keep believing what we've already been following.  This is the point where we see some very deep psychological issues introduced [like transference, guilt forcing one to see the world improperly, ...]
  It is at this point- where the drama/romance changes to Sci-Fi  There had been some important informational hints [the dog, and cryogenics] but we are fairly oblivious to these changes due to the script's working like a magician.  Thus most viewers- I think- will see this as a mystery or brain damage, instead of Sci-Fi.  Everything will come together.
  ""Vanilla Sky"" is a high end film all around.  Great cinematography, Acting, direction, script, F/X, and everything else.  I do feel that the two leading ladies should have switched roles.  And, at moments, I felt that it was a little slow.
  If this hasn't helped go to Wikipedia for:  ""Vanilla Sky"".  Also, it sounds like the 'alternate ending version may be a better choice.",1527033600,,1909,4.728658536585366
