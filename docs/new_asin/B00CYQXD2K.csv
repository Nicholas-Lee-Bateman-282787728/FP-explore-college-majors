5754681,4,B00CYQXD2K,Starting off fairly odd in year 2.  Seems to be deeper and darker this year...compared to year 1.  Not as funny either.  Damonskids was the best episode to date.  Hears hoping that things trend upward into the back half of the season.,1389398400,,234,4.5
5754682,5,B00CYQXD2K,"Season 1 introduced us to the sordid world of management consulting, and was very entertaining, though often implausibly over the top in various ways.  I just finished Season 2 and would say that it's equally entertaining, but it almost feels like a different show altogether, more about the people, less about screwing over clients.  The characters are mostly the same as Season 1, but they develop in different ways, generally becoming deeper, richer, emanating contradictions, more human.  It's good.

To be more specific, the first two episodes made me feel like the series was going downhill to the extent that I almost wanted to bail, but episode 3 with Matt Damon is hilarious, and then the series just keeps changing from there, frequently in unpredictable and chaotic ways.  It's as though the writers are searching for something they can't quite put their finger on, so doing a lot of experimenting, but the result is fascinating and gripping.  The tension builds until the finale, which will leave you very eager to see what unfolds in Season 3, so I'd say Season 2 did its job!",1388534400,9,1089,4.891304347826087
5754693,2,B00CYQXD2K,"I'm just tired of protagonists that are vile, selfish, nasty people. There's nobody to like here. I am all for underdogs and anti-heroes and even tragic heroes undone by their own hubris, but there's no humanity here, just crappy people. And I like Don Cheadle in so many things, but... I'm tired. There are plenty of materialistic, vain, ambitious, dishonest people in real life, in government, so I don't feel like this is a great diversion.",1485734400,2,443,4.842105263157895

5755029,4,B00CYQXD2K,"Amazing show. I preferred Season 1 simply because the characters were still being introduced and hadn't begun to evolve. I respect the choice to make these characters try to improve themselves, and the way it's done is brilliant (especially the scene where Cheadle's character announces his partnership with a political candidate, but I won't spoil it). The only reason I gave this a 4-star rating instead of 5 is that I personally preferred the witty back-and-forth between the pod members from Season 1. This is still present, however the tone is more serious. I understand why it needed to be done, but I'll admit I love how terrible they are to each other.",1477699200,,660,4.849557522123894

I really love that it touches on societal issues such as sexuality, gender, race, ethics, and all the ones I'm forgetting.

5756090,2,B00CYQXD2K,"Clearly from the other reviews I'm in the minority here but just can't find much to like about this series.  Morally bankrupt business consultant Marty Kahn (played by Don Cheadle and Kahn should be spelled ""Con"") and his ""pod"" spend another joyless season screwing over clients for their company Galweather-Stearn.  It still amazes me that Kristin Bell keeps degrading herself in this show playing Jeannie Van Der Hooven along with two other clowns that aid and abet Marty in his dirty dealing in each episode.  If the real world of business consulting is anything like this show then I'm surprised their suicide rate isn't higher than it probably is.  I'm a very cynical guy but compared to these folks I'm Mr. Sunshine.  Those considering this series should be warned there's an abundance of profanity, simulated sex, drug use, heavy drinking, and brief full frontal nudity so if you're sensitive to these things ""House of Lies"" is not for you.  One episode features a lengthy (no pun intended), graphic tour of a client's sex toy factory that I could have lived without seeing.  It's been said never to confuse vulgarity with wit; advice gleefully ignored by the writing team for HoL.  For example in another episode there's an extended joke about a women's genitalia scented cologne with a crass name; if that strikes you as hilarious then you've come to the right place.  So, I'm done with HoL, so is Showtime apparently as they have pulled the plug on the the series after 5 seasons ending this miserable saga.",1470182400,,1517,4.848837209302325

So of course it was ramped up in season 2, but will hopefully normalize (haven't seen the 3 & 4 yet), after the saddest, lamest, by far most unnecessary (I could go on here) display of all so far, which would be  Episode 10. Exit Strategy, when Doug's girlfriend is shown ""helping"" him before an important meeting, in the middle of the day, sitting in a car, in public. I guess things like this probably happen, but if they belong being shown anywhere, it should be some kind of 'reality' show , which I never watch, and which would guarantee I'd never have to see it.

The characters have gotten more interesting and in depth since Season 1.  Very fun and entertaining to watch.

5758038,5,B00CYQXD2K,"I'd give more stars if I could. Absolutely love this series. Binge watched from the first episode to the most recent in the course of about a week and am now having withdrawals. The writing is smart, doesn't pander to the audience; each episode is well paced & chalk full of entertainment,  I was actually surprised recently when I was reminded that each episode is only 30 min; the actors are so talented, they play off each other flawlessly, well cast. I feel the voyeuristic value can't be overstated with this series. If I had a nickel  (dollar, inflation) for every b!+@# I've come across in the work place that could only have benefited from a solid left cross to her grill I'd be not wealthy but certainly able to finance my coffee habit for a week or so.

This is the show for you if your definition of falling in love is seeing in an alley with your partner, drunk and laughing.  Puking together, punching each other and casual sex that's not monogamous during it all.  This isn't comedy, it's a poor attempt of desperation.

5758595,5,B00CYQXD2K,This is what I call an Adult SitCom it's funny R rated w/ a good storyline. Don Cheadle and Kristin Bell are the top names and excellent. Glynn Turman will be familiar as well as Dawn Oliveri shows up as the pycho Ex that shows up ta cause problems. Good stuff put the kids ta bed,1398988800,,280,4.017857142857143
5758596,4,B00CYQXD2K,"I watched House of Lies on a whim and found it to be a very entertaining dark comedy. Going from place to place and either helping or screwing over major companies. Each episode was a different company. Here though, they try to play it much more serious than it was. The tension of the merger is gone, The Rainmaker is mysteriously gone, replaced with some lady who isn't as threatening as the Rainmaker was. But she show is still good and Don Cheadle is still amazing as Marty Kahn. If you liked season one, than season two is still a very fun show. But it lacks the punch season one had.",1398556800,,589,4.315315315315315

5758598,2,B00CYQXD2K,"Season 2 is missing all the fun and intrigue of the first season. Especially , the cool freeze frames where the character gave his witty dialogue about what was really going on. And at this point- grown people constantly calling him 'Daddy' was on my last nerve, and the group dynamic changed so much that it just isn't fun or interesting anymore. I kept trying though, and now wish that I could get my money back for the episodes that I purchased.
If you liked the first season, watch the re-runs - this is an entirely different show.",1397260800,,535,4.469387755102041

5758661,5,B00CYQXD2K,"This is a repeat review from season 1. Not much more specific to say that hasn't already been detailed except that the series evolves over time.  Sure, it was a bit more graphic earlier on.  You can't blame them for using a little more shock to draw people in.  However, it wasn't over the top.  I'm quite comfortable with foul language and adult situations and did not watch this with my kids, so none of it seemed overly gratuitous or out of context.  It was just funny, witty, fast paced, and a little twisted.  My favorite character is the role of Cheadle's borderline psychotic wife, Monica played by Dawn Olivieri.  The subtle mannerisms and inflections she adds in my opinion are comedic gold.  Everyone in the show appears to devour their character, falling completely down the rabbit hole, regardless of the consequences.  In doing so, they elevate each other by becoming so predictably on cue that the banter is almost hard to follow. For me, this show is as good as it gets.",1391472000,2,985,4.6473988439306355

5758666,3,B00CYQXD2K,"Cheadle is fun to watch but this season is let down by poor direction -- actors deliver their lines too rapidly and often mumbled making each episode difficult to watch.
