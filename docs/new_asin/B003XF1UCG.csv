8465852,5,B003XF1UCG,"I think the review from Avid traveler is very inaccurate (is this Rick Steves hiding behind the Avid Traveler name?). Joseph does a decent job, very respectful and enthusiastic about the other cultures. Even says that talking to the local people and hearing their stories and learning about their culture is the best thing that you'll take home with you.",1498608000,2,354,4.916666666666667
8465853,1,B003XF1UCG,"Travelscope is an interesting concept... In theory.  Unfortunately, after watching numerous episodes I have to say Joseph Rosendo comes across as a totally self important, tries to be cute egomaniac.  I'd pass on this very poorly hosted series.",1302220800,2,244,5.394736842105263
