5278249,5,B0099115H8,"I purchased this video at my local discount store, hoping it would be good.  I am extremely pleased with this purchase - it is an excellent beginner's yoga video. So many yoga videos are labeled ""beginner"", but they really aren't for beginners - a lot of Gaiam's other yoga videos come to mind.  This video is very basic, with excellent form tips - without a lot of ""yoga speak"".  It moves at a good pace, without being too fast or too slow.  The instructor is calm and pleasant to listen to, and the scenery is absolutely wonderful.  If you are looking for a basic yoga video, you won't go wrong with this one.  I'm hoping Chrissy makes a followup to this video - I would definitely buy it!",1357084800,4,691,4.359375
5278250,5,B0099115H8,"This DVD is PERFECT for anyone interested in beginning a yoga practice or a yoga practitioner that wants a refresher on the basics of a solid yoga practice. Chrissy's thoughtful practices are lead with clear, concise instructions making yoga accessible to anyone - regardless of experience level. As a fellow yoga teacher, I appreciate Chrissy's focus on proper asana alignment leading the practitioner through a safe, complete beginning yoga practice.",1356998400,20,452,5.4714285714285715
5278251,5,B0099115H8,"I study with Chrissy in New York and was very curious to see how this DVD would be put together. I am happy to say that it was an absolute treat! Her instructions are clear, her sequence is at once intuitive and creative, and she manages to weave an uplifting message into each of the three mini-sequences. As someone who is always trying to bring new people to yoga, I am thrilled to have a DVD I can recommend to them whole-heartedly, with full knowledge that they will be able to follow and will almost certainly learn something about their bodies from this wonderful teacher.. Beginners, take your first steps with Chrissy!",1356739200,11,627,4.607142857142857
5278252,5,B0099115H8,"Having been told that yoga would be great for my very tight body but being totally nervous about looking like a spaz in a class, I went on the hunt for a doable and fun beginner DVD that I could get started with before hitting the yoga studio with all the yogis. Chrissy Carter's Beginning Yoga is TOTALLY IT. Crystal clear, easy to follow instructions peppered with humor and loads of compassion, it's help me access a yoga practice I had always been doubtful could be mine. A note: 'beginner' by no stretch means easy. The yoga sequences here are simple, and while I could definitely learn and do them, they were also work, a welcome surprise!!",1355702400,9,646,4.52991452991453
5278253,5,B0099115H8,"This DVD is fabulous! This is the first yoga DVD I've done at home where I felt I just walked out of a class! It almost felt like a hands-on guided practice, as though Chrissy was in the room with me.
Whether you are new to yoga or are looking for a workout to compliment your yoga practice, this DVD has it all. I've been studying yoga with Chrissy for two years now, and this DVD is just like taking her class. Her instructions are very clear and concise, and the entire practice is challenging without being too difficult. She is excellent at breaking down each yoga pose. What a lot of yoga DVDs miss, including so-called ""beginner"" yoga DVDs, are the clear explanations of what your body should be doing in each pose, how the alignment works-- many at-home practices simply gloss over this in order to get through a lot of poses. This leads to improper form and possible injury. Chrissy makes sure to explain what your body should be and not be doing in each pose and reminds you of these instructions throughout the practice. After doing the workout my body felt alive and refreshed!
This DVD is definitely a great companion to the classes I take every week.
Invite Chrissy into your living room and give this DVD a try!",1355270400,,1226,4.477678571428571
5278254,5,B0099115H8,"I have been practicing yoga for almost two years and still consider myself a ""beginner"". I love this DVD because the instructor reinforces the correct form for all of the key poses. The three different sessions are great...very digestible and manageable (just 20 minutes each). Chrissy is literally a breath of fresh air.",1354838400,,321,5.0754716981132075
5278255,5,B0099115H8,"Like the previous reviewer, I haven't seen it yet as it's only available on pre order, but I cannot stress strongly enough: if you are looking to start a yoga practice, returning to yoga after a break, need motivation but have little time or budget to get to a yoga studio, or even just have a pulse and a DVD machine....BUY THIS DVD and bring Chrissy into your home (albeit virtually)!

Chrissy Carter is that rare gem: an authentic, intelligent, compassionate and expert teacher who you can truly trust. Simply put: she knows yoga, she understands bodies (she is a teacher of anatomy), pieces together a practice with great thought and insight and is THE perfect person to be presenting this particular DVD. Teaching beginners, contrary to popular belief, is very hard. Teaching beginners well, so that they approach the mat with mindfulness and come away uninjured, at peace and with a better understanding of themselves is very, very hard. Making sure that a home practice (where the biggest hurdle is that your teacher can't see you, thus prevent injury by making adjustments or answering questions) is safe and enjoyable requires the right person with an expert approach. Chrissy is that person.

As a yoga teacher myself, I've been asked countless times by my students what DVD or on line class I'd recommend. Now I have one I can recommend, wholeheartedly.",1354060800,4,1364,4.9004329004329
5278256,5,B0099115H8,"I ordered 6 on a pre order- of course I have not seen this yet but I cannot tell you how thrilled I am just looking forward to having this DVD. Chrissy Carter is my yoga teacher and trust me when I say you are in for a TREAT and a luxury to have her practice with you in your living room! You will love this yoga DVD!

I did read the other reviews before hand and agree that it might be a bit hard to follow as some of the language does not make sense if you have never done yoga before.  Because I read the reviews I took the time to watch the DVD from start to finish the day before I put everything into practice.  By doing this I had a good idea of what was going to come next, how to position my body etc.  1 month in and I'm loving his DVD.",1434758400,,474,3.757575757575758

5278415,4,B0099115H8,"I bought this for my daughter who is beginning her practice and previewed it before giving it to her. Chrissy does an excellent job of explaining and setting a basis for the asanas. It is so important to understand how to align the body and mind so as not to habitually continue to practice in a way that could be dangerous or harmful. Even though I have been practicising several years, I wish that I had seen this Dvd when I started out. Previewing it, I can say that I learned a few things myself.  Currently, I find this one to be a little slow and not quite challenging enough for my tastes, but the instruction on this dvd make it perfect for those just starting out.",1414281600,,673,4.299212598425197

5278451,1,B0099115H8,This DVD is complete and utter junk! I'm a beginner and have been going to classes so I decide to give this a try at home. The girl covers basic posses but she goes through them so fast it defeats the purpose of yoga. Total waste of time and money. Do not buy!,1409097600,3,260,3.9245283018867925

5278454,5,B0099115H8,Its easy to follow but challenging.  Not to difficult for those of us who are completely new to yoga. It is split into three separate sections of 20 minutes that you can do individually or you can do all three in one session.

5278456,5,B0099115H8,I have been using Chrissy yoga DVD for about a month now. I look forward to doing it every morning. Which is saying a lot as I am an ex-military person suffering from Severe Depression and getting out of bed can be very difficult. The poses are easy to understand and the light touches of humor make me smile every time I hear them. I would and have recommended Chrissy's DVD to friends an family.,1393891200,6,397,4.306666666666667
5278457,3,B0099115H8,"Just OK, speaker talked to quickly as she moved from one pose to another.  Did not give you pointers to ensure your body was in proper alignment.  I guess nothing beats a real class.  Good for a stretching class at home",1393286400,2,219,4.2926829268292686

5278459,5,B0099115H8,"I am not new to yoga, but I am still a beginner, and I appreciate any instruction I can get on poses. I LOVE Chrissy's instruction in this DVD.  The ""Connect"" segment is especially good.  She explains poses in terms you can understand!  For example, when doing Cat Pose, she talks about carving out your stomach like you are carving out the last bit of ice cream from the carton...very vivid and understandable!  For Downward Dog, she says to crease your hips deeply, like a billfold.  Also, the way she teaches Tree Pose makes it so doable.  I LOVE this DVD!!",1390348800,,560,4.4950495049504955
5278470,3,B0099115H8,"I know a lot of people have left really positive views, but I found the transition to moves and voice instruction too fast and overwhelming. There really isn't time to listen and understand what she is telling you, because she doesn't ever pause to allow you to digest the information. It's really a non-stop stream of instructions, and it actually ends up giving me a slight headache. Too much and too fast for me, a REAL beginner.",1390348800,7,432,4.623376623376624
5278471,4,B0099115H8,"First of all, I would describe myself as a yoga-hater who has been trying and trying to like yoga -- because EVERYONE constantly recommends it to me, especially since I'm 51 and have back problems.  I've been lifting weights and doing step aerobics since my 20s, and don't have a New Age, holistic bone in my body -- but wanted some form of exercise that's a little less strenuous.  So I've tried about a dozen yoga videos, all of which were described as ""non-mystical"" and ""muscle toning and strengthening"" -- and they were all far too slow, sleepy and excruciatingly boring for me.  ""Lie on your back, close your eyes, relax and BREATHE..."" for 5 minutes.  Then ""Open your eyes, relax and BREATHE...."" for another 5 minutes.  And people kid themselves that this is ""exercise""?
  Well, Chrissy Carter's video is the first one I didn't give up on after 10 minutes.  First of all, the scenery and music are very nice.  Chrissy is pleasant and friendly, but very matter-of-fact and non-mystical.  Her instructions are very clear (""Try to feel like you're pulling the floor towards you"").  And -- most importantly to me -- the video moves at a good clip.  If anything, she goes a little TOO fast, as others have said!  Definitely not a lot of ""breathe deeeeply and relaaaaax.""  (And I know you yoga purists are gonna slam me for saying that.)  But the three routines here (about 15 min. each) are nice, quick, do-able intros to yoga moves.  They would work very well as early-morning-wake-up-and- stretch-out-the-kinks routines, to help with sciatica or other back problems, or as a cool-down/stretch after a more strenuous workout.  And you definitely get some back and shoulder strengthening here.  One small criticism I have is that, even though some of the poses are challenging, she doesn't give you a lot of modifications for beginners.  Planks and ""Downward Dogs"" are quite hard if you're 50+ and out of shape.  But again, I am pleased with this purchase and will use it fairly often.
  The only reason I subtracted one star is not Chrissy's fault.  It is because the DVD starts with at least 10 minutes of commercials for other Gaiam videos, which you cannot fast-forward through.  REALLY annoying!  So I pop in the dvd BEFORE I change into my yoga duds.",1390262400,4,2259,4.760309278350515
5278472,5,B0099115H8,"I am a true beginner.. I have only attended one yoga class, and it was an embarrassing disaster. I have had a hip injury and someone suggested yoga could help. I went to Target and bought 4 different begginer DVDs. I wish I could take the others back.  They were all too fast, vague, weird, and annoying. I seriously almost gave up.

Then I tried this one. I watched it all the way through first because with the others I had to constantly look up to figure out what they were trying to do. This one had a better flow to it. Chrissy had so many little pointers to make sure your body is aligned right. Exactly what I needed. Seriously.  I read through other reviews that say it moves to fast. Compared to all the others, this one does not.

With her instructions it was very easy to catch on -after watching it through the first time, following along the second time, i rarely had to look up. Her cues are right on. When I did look up, I was so excited I was right where she was in the sequence. The others I was always fumbling to keep up or see what the world they were trying to explain.

This is perfect for beginners to learn the basic form when you don't have anyone to show you. Trust me. I'm older and this is not too fast. It moves so smoothly and has a nice flow. I've been doing this a week now and already I feel a difference through the moves. I am stretching a little farther, I can tell my balance is a little stronger. -and I am a super clutz. imagine the bride of Frankenstein on a high wire...yeah.

The scenery is so beautiful. When we get to the last part, I pretend I am there.  The music is beautiful, and not at all over powering. Chrissy's voice is soothing, but uplifting and motivating. There is no competition between music and voice. It is broken up into segments but still flows -it will keep going without pushing play again. You can do 1 or two segments or the whole thing. I like that I can tayloror it to what I have time for.

The poses and movements are a wide variety but basic.  More than the other DVDs. I feel like when I perfect these, I won't be ashamed or embarrassed if I decide to go to a class.  I looked to see if she had any more out, but this was her first and just out last year I think.  I really hope she does more.  This would actually be good for people who are more experienced and want a light day.  Not elaborate or complicated.

She does have a really nice website. Her posts are awesome. Check out the one about listening with your eyes.

I'll be first in line for her next one.",1390003200,22,2536,4.136456211812627
5278473,5,B0099115H8,I found an excerpt of this DVD on Hulu and loved it so much that I bought this DVD. It helped me get my flexibility back after having my son and created a new love and respect for yoga. Chrissy makes the poses easy to understand by giving great explanations.

5278475,5,B0099115H8,"I found the first routine to be a very good introduction to poses and a good workout.  Quickly reviewing the other two routines, they seem more difficult and strenuous as expected and seem to do a good job building on the first routine, though I'm not ready to try them yet.  I bought 2 DVDs to start with and browsing them both, the Chrissy Carter one was definitely the preferred one of the two to start with, bringing more motion and somewhat faster paced than the Barbara Benagh one.",1389312000,,487,4.46067415730337
5278476,2,B0099115H8,"Unlike other yoga videos which have three distinct sections, connection to breath, active poses, and floor poses leading to shivasana, this video is ""any pose - any time"" oh yeah, and shivasana at the end.

5278477,5,B0099115H8,"I recently tried Mandy Ingber's yoga video (Jennifer Aniston's instructor). Mandy was so egotistical and annoying and it had been awhile since I practiced Yoga so I wanted something that offered explanations.
My husband (totally new to Yoga and very inflexible!) decided to work out with me. He really found Mandy's video difficult and annoying. I ordered this because it was only 7.89 at the time and I thought if I hated it, I wouldn't be out much money.
Well, I LOVED it. Chrissy is so easy going and explains the moves in such a way that even my husband understands! She is humble, ques well, and effortlessly charming. I also LOVE LOVE the scenery (I hate videos shot in boring studios!). But just because it's easy to follow, doesn't mean it's not challenging. I woke up after doing the Stretch version and was appropriately sore. I also love that each segment is 20 minutes. For those who get bored or distracted easily or are ""really busy,"" it's the perfect length. Really got my money's worth!!",1379635200,,1003,4.704545454545454

I could not have made a better purchase!  Having 3 workouts provides stepping stones for mastering the poses as well as variety.  I LOVE this product.  If you're new to yoga or are somewhat inflexible--this is the workout for you!,1378684800,7,404,4.867647058823529

It has 3 different levels, each one builds on upon one another.  You can keep it easy, or challenge yourself.  It is so versatile !  My strength and flexibility have improved significantly! Also, I look forward to doing yoga every day.. Now that is something to smile about!!  Thanks Chrissy",1376092800,,464,4.518072289156627

I purchased this DVD and it was the best investment I made Ms Carter is a great teacher the moves are easy to follow, and her encouragement through out the workout is great. I have other beginners yoga dvd's and was discourage about how fast pace they where and found the moves difficult and they are kind of hard to follow, that is not what you are going to encounter with this tape I highly recommend it.",1375228800,,591,5.964705882352941
5278520,5,B0099115H8,"Great learning video for beginners.  She gives you time to do the
Moves.  Can't wait to get better to get the next one.",1372291200,,119,4.130434782608695
5278521,5,B0099115H8,"This DVD is perfect to supplement your beginning practice. When I don't have time to make it to the studio to take class, this DVD is perfect for keeping my practice consistent and well rounded. An hour is a perfect amount of time, and I like that it is also segmented in case I have less than an hour.
I read the other reviews, and the one about it being to fast stood out to me. My time in the studio has taught me to go at my own pace and give what I'm able to give at that time. So, I would encourage the person who purchased the DVD to go at their own pace. Pause the DVD if you want to be in a pose longer or take more time. Sometimes I'll pause or rewind the DVD so I can do a pose over and over if I feel like it.
In summary, let this DVD be an extra tool to keep your practice consistent. If you haven't been to a studio yet, let this DVD encourage you to get into a studio and further explore yoga. If you're already in a studio consistently and a beginner, this will be a great supplement to your practice.",1366329600,,1017,3.894230769230769
5278522,3,B0099115H8,"Chrissy is charismatic and her voice is nice with good instruction. A good beginner DVD that I really wanted to like but  she moves too fast from pose to pose, not allowing adequate time for deep breathing. I find the selection format annoying, you select the entire workout there is a break between the segments that breaks the flow of the workout.  Tried using the DVD and getting past the things that I don't like but would find myself quitting mid session so it has gone on the shelf with other DVD's I have bought and don't use.",1365984000,5,533,4.428571428571429
5278523,4,B0099115H8,"This DVD moves along quickly with the pose names captioned.  Carter moves smoothly from one pose into another. However, as a beginner , older practitioner, I found Carter moving a bit too quickly for me, which is why I gave it a 4.
It is excellently done and presented, but  it will be put away for awhile until I am more experienced, and stay with my ""Gentle Yoga with Jane Adams (for 40-70 year olds).",1365638400,9,403,4.36
5278524,5,B0099115H8,"I recommend this DVD for beginners and also for people, who would like some new inspiration for their self practice.",1365379200,,116,4.85
5278525,5,B0099115H8,I bought this DVD for myself and then one for everyone else! I love that I can practice with it at home instead of having to go to the gym or studio. I found that I can really focus on proper alignment with it instead of worrying about flying through the sequence like some other DVDs. Chrissy is a great instructor and I would love to see an intermediate DVD from her so I can take it to the next level at home.,1364860800,,412,3.9759036144578315
5278526,4,B0099115H8,"This video was fun, but very slow.  I did two of the 20 minute segments and did not break a sweat.  The instructions are great and really helped me learn proper technique.  This will be perfect when I need something light.",1363824000,2,222,4.365853658536586
5278527,5,B0099115H8,I had just started a yoga class once a week and was looking for a DVD to do at home that catered to beginners and explained the postures so I could be sure I was doing them correctly.  Chrissy has a very soothing voice and she does a great job explaining and modeling correct posture.  There are three 20 minute segments of the DVD so you have the choice of stopping or continuing on after each section..  Definitely recommended for beginners!,1362614400,,443,4.444444444444445
5278528,4,B0099115H8,"I have taken several yoga stretch classes, but my yoga buddy has not.  I was searching for an instructional video that would suit us both and give us a good introduction for a once/twice weekly workout.  We both enjoyed the setting of this video; the water sounds were soothing.  The narration and pacing was easy to follow.  We also enjoyed Tamal Dodge's ""Hatha & Flow Yoga for Beginners"", which might be just a bit more challenging.  It was worth the price and I would recommend it to others who are beginning their practice.",1361750400,,527,4.623655913978495
5278559,5,B0099115H8,I'm a beginner and bought this DVD while on maternity leave and loved it. I wanted something to help get me back in shape but something I could use at home on my own time. Chrissy is an amazinig instructor. I felt I could easily follow along (something that is usually lost with other DVDs) and she provided alternate poses so I could either do a beginner-level workout or something more challenging. You can definitely grow with this DVD. I also liked how you can switch from a complete voice-over to a minimal voice-over depending on your mood and the type of workout you are looking to achieve. Highly recommended!,1361491200,,617,4.618181818181818
5278560,5,B0099115H8,"As a long time yoga enthusiast i found Ms. Carter's video to be exceptional. I recommend yoga on a daily basis to my patients in my nutrition practice - and was excited to find a video that is perfect for beginners and yet one that could also help the more seasoned yogi to understand their practice more deeply. Ms. Carter's precise instructions, gems of wisdom, and overall excitement of yoga is definitely contagious !!!",1361491200,,423,4.72972972972973
5278561,5,B0099115H8,"Beginning Yoga with Chrissy is simple and spot on for everyone new to yoga!! She walks you through poses in a relaxed and attainable sequence with her clear and precise directions with her touch of humor. The three segments are short and easy to follow. Before you know it, you've done yoga and realize you're already feeling better! I'd recommend this to anyone and friends curious and contemplating about yoga.",1360368000,,412,4.9
5278562,3,B0099115H8,I hope whoever does this isn't over 60...I did it because it said BEGINNING yoga...it moves too fast for a true beginner.,1360108800,12,121,4.545454545454546
5278563,5,B0099115H8,"I received my Beginning Yoga DVD from amazon and couldn't wait to try it.  It has been a few years since I've done a ""home practice"" of any kind so I was not sure what to expect.  The DVD is separated into 3 sections, each about 30 minutes long.  I started with the first portion titled ""Connect"".  Although I have had a yoga practice for many years, I find a beginning yoga class (or in this case DVD) can still be challenging and allows me to focus more on doing the poses ""right"".  Chrissy has many good pointers on how to do the poses ""right"", many I have not heard before and really allow for good visualization of the proper form.  I found her analogies helpful and I made adjustments after hearing them.  I am excited to try the following chapters and will update my review afterwards...",1360108800,,794,4.360544217687075
5278564,4,B0099115H8,"Save this one for an ""easy"" day, after all it is Beginner yoga.  I still enjoyed it.  The practitioner was precise and instructed well.  There were a few innovations which were appreciated also.  The second segment was a little slow going for me, but after a long hectic day at work, it is a healthy practice.  If you are feeling more energetic the first segment would be appropriate.  I enjoy this practice and even having practiced yoga for 30 plus years, I am always open to new and relaxing practices!!!",1359504000,7,507,4.5777777777777775
5278565,5,B0099115H8,"As a former regular yogi who could have attended and hung in at an advanced class, I was needing to re-start my practice gently, post-pregnancy and after years off.  Chrissy Carter's Beginner's video was the perfect way to do it.  Each pose was broken down carefully with a focus on correct form.  Chrissy uses humor and clever analogies to ensure you're taking care of your body in each pose.  It was a great way to remind myself of the basics, and even for a technical non-beginner, I felt like I'd had a good, vigorous, challenging practice.  Chrissy's instruction was clear, easy to follow and fun and the video is well produced with beautiful scenery.  Highly recommend to beginners and those looking for a thoughtful practice.",1358121600,3,732,4.816
5278566,5,B0099115H8,"I've had the pleasure of attending Chrissy's classes for the past five years.  To now be able to access Chrissy in my living room and share her teaching with my friends and family across the world is fabulous.  What makes Chrissy the best teacher is her compassion, she truly cares about her students.  I purchased this dvd for my mom so she could get started with yoga and understand what I've been raving about.  Mom and I practiced the dvd together, our first yoga practice together!  I highly recommend this dvd for any beginning or tenured yoga student.  Enjoy!",1357948800,2,566,4.666666666666667
5278567,5,B0099115H8,"I ""happen"" to have had the great, good fortune to take Level 1 class with Chrissy when living in NYC. I've been practicing yoga for over 30 years, and Chrissy is one of the very best teachers I have ever encountered (and I've practiced both ashtanga and Iyengar styles). What makes Chrissy so great? First, with the light touch of humor, she is a natural at conveying the core of postures and positions. Second, and the reason I appreciate her so much, is her teaching is dimensional, encapsulating the philosophy of yoga while making it fun. Hopefully Gaiam will allow her to make a follow-up DVD using props, for there is never a dull moment when these are introduced into the mix. Buy this DVD: you will not be disappointed!",1357862400,2,727,4.6
5278568,5,B0099115H8,Chrissy is a great teacher. The video is broken down nicely for beginners. Very precise and alignment based. Highly recommend.,1357430400,,126,5.35

8537880,3,B0099115H8,"This is a fast paced DVD. The poses I feel are geared towards beginners however she moves entirely too fast and doesn't give you a moment to be in the pose. She also talks entirely too much. The whole session is filled with chatter, which I don't enjoy as I prefer a more peaceful and relaxing yoga session. If your looking for a more quick paced DVD this may be for you. However, I wouldn't recommend for beginners or anyone using yoga to relax and find peace.",1472688000,,461,4.310344827586207
8537881,5,B0099115H8,She does speak quickly and this may not be the best if you don' have any yoga experience at all but I love all three sections and her instruction. It leaves me feeling like I have done a good workout.,1467158400,,200,4.025
8537882,5,B0099115H8,This is a great video. I love how it teaches you to link breathing to the poses. I was a bit hard for me at first to keep up with the routines but now it is much easier. The instruction is also awesome.,1459555200,,202,3.7209302325581395
8537883,4,B0099115H8,"I like this video, but it is not for beginners.  She goes too quickly and does not give enough detail on the poses.  You barely think you may have the pose right and she is already onto the next one.  This is for someone who is familiar with all the poses and does not need any instruction.  Even after a few months I still struggle with this video.  Rodney Yee's Yoda for Beginners is much better for true beginners.",1456790400,5,417,4.227848101265823
8537884,1,B0099115H8,"Sure wish I had read the negative reviews first.  Saw all the positive stars and that it was an award winner, but it's certainly not a beginner's DVD.  She speaks much too quickly and doesn't allow time for the breaths she asks you to take.  Only tried one segment, but it left me stressed with neck pain from trying to watch her while lying flat on the mat.  Please don't waste your money if you're a senior beginner like me.
