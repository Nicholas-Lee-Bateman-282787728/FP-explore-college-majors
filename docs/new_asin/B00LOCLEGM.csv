6495086,1,B00LOCLEGM,"Very disappointing. In the first 30 minutes, it just had too much trashiness and stupidity and not enough redeeming qualities to keep watching. I much prefer the Hallmark Christmas movies that are almost always great for family viewing and make you feel uplifted at the end.",1417910400,,274,4.978260869565218

6495090,2,B00LOCLEGM,"The two people pictured on the front of this packaging aren't in the movie. It also said Kevin Sorbo was involved and he wasn't in it either.
Apparently, the goal was to say don't assume you know people until you really get to know them, but that was a tiny fraction and just a few moments of the entire movie, the rest was justwhatever you want to call it. It didn't blow my hair back.",1415577600,9,386,4.16

6495104,3,B00LOCLEGM,This was a mildly amusing film. I watched it because I like Vivica A. Fox and Chris Kattan. Fox had a nice role. She was great and Kattan was good in a smaller role. The film focused on themes of redemption. The theme was that we should get to know people of different backgrounds and not rush to prejudge people. The film takes place during Christmas but the film is more about relationships than Christmas. I recommend this film for fans of Fox. Chabert from Party of Five was adorable. Malambri from Step Up3D held the movie together and had great chemistry with Chabert. This film would be rated PG. This is a clean family film. I also recommend this for fans of family films.,1422316800,5,680,4.448
