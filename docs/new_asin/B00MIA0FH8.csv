6582924,5,B00MIA0FH8,"Writer and director Martin Provost's film of the life of trailblazing French novelist Violette Leduc (In the Prison of Her Skin, The Bastard) is elegant and epic, overflowing with fascinating period detail and poignant depictions of the volatile human condition.  It instantly earns its place among the finest literary film biographies, including The Bront Sisters and An Angel at My Table.  As the film begins, the Second World War is raging, and Violette (Emmanuelle Devos) earns a living trading contraband.  She lives in the countryside with writer, dubious entrepreneur, and general rogue Maurice Sachs (Olivier Py).  Theirs is an uneasy truce.  She loves or at least covets him.  He is gay.  They adore, intrigue, and despise one another in almost equal measure.  He quietly slips away and out of her life one morning, but not before encouraging her to write to exorcise her personal demons, many of which stem from her distant mother and an absent father who never recognized her as his child.  As the war draws to a close, she finds herself in Paris.  In the city, her writing ushers her into a now-iconic sphere of authors, philosophers, and raconteurs.  She forges a particularly profound bond with Simone de Beauvoir (Sandrine Kiberlain).  The formidable existential feminist champions Violette's writing even as early sales prove tepid, and Violette in turn falls in love with Simone, the complications of which intensify her already-vast capacity for despair and self-doubt.

This film understands how to fit a life story into the time and space provided by a feature film of a reasonable length.  It does not start at Violette's birth nor does it end with her death, and it is not afraid to embrace ellipses or let the significance of certain details or gestures slowly come into focus.  What it does perfectly is reveal the soul of its subject.  The intimacy achieved is nothing short of magical, and it is important considering Violette is a character who, from the outside, could simply register as hard, unpleasant, and prone to incomprehensible mood swings.  Her highs are as euphoric for us as they are for her, and her lows as devastating.  The film also finds visual and aural ways, including sparing, but revealing use of voice-over, to depict Violette's creativity and mental processes, both when the insights and phrases are gushing forth and when she fears she is finished as a writer.  Anyone who tries (or has tried) to express themselves with a pen or a keyboard will find the rush and the frustration highly recognizable.

The two central performances are monumental.  In the paragraph above, I praised the way the film lays bare the emotional and intellectual complexity of Violette, and the committed and ferocious Emmanuelle Devos deserves a significant percentage of the credit.  She is one of contemporary French cinema's finest talents, and this may be her best performance to date, eclipsing her astonishing turn a decade ago in the masterpiece Kings & Queen.  Her inhabiting of Violette is a marvel.  Every smile, syllable, tear, and tic is distinctive and enlightening.  Superb, too, is Sandrine Kiberlain as Simone de Beauvoir.  She plays her as a figure both stern and sensitive, able to flay when pushed and gently foster when inspired.  Even when blended with confusion or fatigue, her compassion for Violette as a person (and depth of conviction regarding her authorial ability) is always crisp and vivid.  Together, Devos and Kiberlain create one of the most touching and intricate on-screen female friendships in recent memory.  Also of note in a more modest role is Olivier Gourmet.  His character is a curious and, in his own way, important footnote to 20th-century French literature:  perfume-industry magnate Jacques Gurin used his wealth to encircle himself with such chic, influential minds as De Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre and also to rescue and collect manuscripts, including many by Marcel Proust.  Gourmet's portrayal of him as a friendly, shy, and nerdy acolyte is sweetly charming.",1417392000,3,4042,5.105022831050229

6582930,5,B00MIA0FH8,"Violette Leduc kept good company.

She was friends with Nobel prize winners Jean Paul Sartre and Albert Camus, and her mentor, Sartre's girlfriend, and in her own right, a famous writer, Simone de Beauvoir.

A very philosophical existential life. Oh, yeah, she was also friends with existential playwright radical Jean Genet.

Director Martin Provost does a good job in maintaining the feel of France after World War II. He does this by playing with lights, usually somber, and by replicating life in France right after the war, very little money and food, and he uses furniture of the epoch.

Violette grew up with a mother relationship problem. She was born out of wedlock. It haunts her throughout her life. She gets involved with a man who is a homosexual. He leaves her for Germany. She herself engages in lesbianism, but has affairs with men. Then her life changes; she meets de Beauvoir when she hands the famous French writer a manuscript. de Beauvoir is impressed. And passes the novel to Camus. He is also impressed.

The quest for existential fulfillment in a barren, cold indifferent world, where Rene Descartes's philosophy of ""I think therefore I am"" becomes ""I think therefore I suffer"" is the underlining gist of this story. In a nutshell, it's about a woman's quest to reach literature fulfillment. Violette does just that by writing about nine novels in her life, including one of her most famous ""Le Batarde."" Unlike other existentialist work, however, there's no absurdity, a dark humor in an absurd world.

This movie is in French. The language is simple to understand plus there is adequate English subtitles. I'm fluent in French so I understood every spoken word. Angst is the driving plot of this story. Her personal angst with her mother, and her struggle to be heard in a deaf world. She is hardcore determined to reach literature's highest plate for the time: the existential life - Why am I Here? - based on Sartre's great philosophical oeuvre ""Being and Nothingness.""

Her friendship with de Beauvoir gave Violette inspiration to write. She writes mainly to escape from her misery. Yet in the existential world misery is natural. It's a world of suffering, some shut it out, some are overwhelmed by it.",1411171200,11,2232,4.904509283819628

6582932,4,B00MIA0FH8,"Violette is a slow paced but interesting French film which recounts the life of the writer Violette Le Duc from around the end of WW2 up until her later life when she is about to taste success as writer. She is a complex character who variously is involved with the Black Market, struggles with the painful truth of her illegitimacy and her relationship with her mother, and falls in love with the unattainable, from Maurice who is homosexual, to the Existentialist writer Simone De Beauvoir with whom she has a long standing obsession. Though many a French postwar Literature big name is mentioned or appears in the film from Genet to Sartre and Camus, the focus really is on Violette. Emanuelle Devos plays the main lead well and I thought that Sandrine Kiberlain was an ideal De Beauvoir. The film is a reflection on the condition of women in France at the time, and also addresses issues of sexual identity and unrequited love. It's very much a film for the confirmed Francophile or anyone with an interest in the life of the somewhat forgotten feminist writer that is Violette Leduc, who was heavily censured when she was first writing and who is still of interest today for being a woman ahead of her time.

I thought that Martin Provost's film was worth the watch. It was heavy on long silences and slow paced and the drab atmosphere of a country just at the end of War and Occupation was well captured. I watched with subtitles and the translation was well done and did not jar at any point. It's not an easy watch necessarily and is quite uncomfortable viewing in parts, but it's well crafted, interesting and left me knowing more about a writer whose existence I was unaware of despite being familiar with the work of De Beauvoir and other writers in the film. It was thought provoking and interesting and I enjoyed it.",1422662400,4,1829,4.627692307692308
6582933,5,B00MIA0FH8,"This is a very interesting, true story about how a talented woman emerges as an artist.  Violette is the bastard daughter of a troubled woman, on her own, impoverished, and lonely.  Still she has great talent, not only for airing issues that no one has written about - bi-sexuality, lesbian love, the need for intimacy - but as a pioneer of confessional autobiography.  With a great stroke of luck, she finds in mentor in Simone de Beauvoir, one of the literary stars of the post-WWII era.  De Beauvoir immediately recognizes her gifts and sets about to nurture her, offering suggestions, criticism, and finally money to keep Violette going.  Their relationship is extremely subtle and portrayed with a beautiful ambiguity, even mystery.  I found it thoroughly engrossing and refreshingly un-Hollywood in its pacing and themes.

Beyond this seminal relationship, Violette becomes friends with some of the most fascinating literary talents of the period, including Genet and Camus.  This too is handled with humor and by implication, leaving a great deal for the viewer to fill in, particularly by their knowledge of the writers and that period of French history - it stimulates a desire to learn more.  De Beauvoir's sexuality is also left out, which would never have been the case in a Hollywood production.

THis is not to say that her path was easy.  She remains isolated and often in despair that the way of her art is too difficult.  At one point, she has a nervous breakdown and is given electroshock therapy.  But de Beauvoir is always there, offering the right word at the right time, pushing her ever so slightly into some promising direction, displaying unshakeable faith in Violette's talent, and expanding her horizons when necessary, such as her suggestion to travel.

If you like modern EUropean film, this is one of the best I have seen in years.  Warmly recommended.",1422576000,2,1882,4.968051118210862

6582937,4,B00MIA0FH8,"For our subject of interest is one Violette Leduc, a former black marketer turned celebrated writer, for her life, appears, as a series of crushing disappointments.

When you first see Violette in Martin Provost's striking, perceptively absorbing and stirring biographical representation she's sneaking through the dark with a suitcase full of black-market goods, which creates quite the vivid, snapshot of her reality at that point. It's World War II and Violette is living is sullenly at best. Mr. Provost Film does not try to fill in every detail of the writer's life. Rather, we see her starting her story when she begins to write, and the narrative seems jumps, if not leaps across time, jumping from one crucial segment of her life to another.

We are shown the guru-student relationship of authors' post-war Paris; the writer's life portrays an unrequited love affair, with all its hindrances. Sandrine Kiberlain plays Simone de Beauvoir - as a difficult, but just and controlling figure. Emmanuelle Devos is even better, as the impoverished, obsessed Violette Leduc, who arrives on De Beauvoir's doorstep with a battered manuscript of her unpublished novel; L'Asphyxie .Simone identifies the contents as the product of a raw, yet brave intelligence that perhaps outshines her own. Persistently, De Beauvoir supports Leduc's vacillating vocation with coinage and guidance, while Leduc remains in anguish of antipathy at the charity and of unrequited love. For all the confusion and discomfort that is shown. This is a narrative - that is at times is idealistic: a piece illustrating a splendid confirmation that playwrights really can attain self-validation by the pen.",1418256000,,1676,5.320754716981132

It is not a biography. I learned nothing about her from this movie. POSSIBLE SPOILER: Take for instance the scene were she goes into a restroom, gets lightheaded, sees blood running down her leg and faints.

8672499,5,B00MIA0FH8,"I found this riveting from beginning to end, so well-acted you forget you're watching actors in a film.  I read nothing beforehand about the film or the facts (except I knew of Simone de Beauvoir's life and work)- I was carried along by Violette's story- where would it go?  Not sure this would be everyone's cup of tea.  ***Spoiler Alert***  Violette is multi-faceted, complex- ever seeking, hungry for love and meaning and peace.  Juxtaposed to stark, base sexuality, troubled relationships and squalor is Violette's shimmering prose, sublime in its beauty, originality and depth of feeling.  Subtle, episodic, slow-moving; though raw/brutal at times, there are many moments to savor.  I thought it splendid in presenting a woman's evolution over time, and especially, in its depiction of middle-age with age being quite beside the point (that is, you're able to view it through a wider lens of a life in its entirety).  The hiking and scenes in the French countryside were particularly revealing, and transcendent.  For me, very thought-provoking.  Highly recommended.

Somehow, because it is with English subtitles, the dialogue throughout the movie was reduced to a whisper. So I had to read the subtitles even though I could have comfortably watched the movie in French. It makes for a practically silent movie and takes the essence of the movie away. I might have enjoyed it otherwise. It seems that the whole thing is directed at the English speaking mass. When someone rents a French movie, they want to hear and see a French movie!

8672505,4,B00MIA0FH8,"French actor, screenwriter and director Martin Provost`s fifth feature film which he co-wrote with screenwriters Marc Abdelnour and Ren de Ceccaty, is inspired by the life of a French 20th century author. It premiered in the Special Presentations section at the 38th Toronto International Film Festival in 2013, was shot on locations in France and is a France-Belgium co-production which was produced by producers Milna Poylo and Gilles Sacuto. It tells the story about a daughter and sister named Violette Leduc who was born in the early 1900s in Arras in the commune of Pas-de-Calais in Northern France, at that time derogatorily called a bastard, who lived with her mother named Berthe and grandmother named Fidline, met a man named Ernest Dehous in 1913 and who had begun her formal education at collge Valenciennes when the First World War started.

Distinctly and subtly directed by French filmmaker Martin Provost, this quietly paced and fictionalized reconstruction of real events which is narrated mostly from the main character`s point of view, draws a heartrendingly humane portrayal of a French citizen whom in the early 1940s during the Second World War in Normandie, France, met a Jewish Roman Catholic writer named Maurice Sachs, as a 33-year-old wrote for the first edition of the magazine Pour Elle and the daily newspaper Paris-Soir and who after the liberation of France was introduced to a French novelist and playwright named Jean Genet and a French perfumer and collector named Jacques Gurin. While notable for its versatile and atmospheric milieu depictions, reverent cinematography by cinematographer Yves Cape, production design by production designer Thierry Franois and costume design by costume designer Madeline Fontaine, this character-driven and narrative-driven story about significant people in the history of French culture and a memorable person who got her first novel called In the Prison of her Skin published in 1946, depicts an internal study of character.

This densely historic, at times humerous and conversational reminiscence which is set in France in the 20th century and where a boarding school student and alumni at Lyce Racine in Paris, France who in the mid-1960s met a French author named Franoise d`Eubonne and whose life was marred by the ... of being born, starts an invaluable friendship with a French 20th century thinker who was writing a book and who encourages her to go on writing and use her personal experiences, is impelled and reinforced by its cogent narrative structure, substantial character development, subtle continuity, use of music, comment by Madame Simone Ernestine Lucie Marie Bertrand de Beauvoir: The way you see yourself has changed. and the majestic acting performances by French actresses Emmanuelle Devos and Sandrine Kiberlain. A reflectively biographical, eloquently literary and lyrically cinematographic narrative feature.",1429488000,,2907,5.415011037527594
