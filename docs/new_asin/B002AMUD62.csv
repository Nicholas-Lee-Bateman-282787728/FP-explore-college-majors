3886645,5,B002AMUD62,"Three best friends share a secret, a secret that no one else knows. H2O is a amazing series. Cleo (wind),Emma (Ice),and Rikki (Fire)have their friendship grow stronger and stronger along with thier powers. Lewis is the only human that knows about their powers, but later on Zane and Ash(Rikki and Emma's boyfriends)find out the magical secret. It would be more, magical if the main characters had different color of tails. Such as Emma would have a light blue tail. Cleo which has the power of wind would greatly benifit if she had a silver tail. Rikki would have the same color sence it resembles fire. This would be a great change in a further season if you plan on making one. It would be Their powers(stronger) and their tail colors changed. Like an evelotion of their powers as mermaids.  I hope you take my suggestion into consideration of your Film.
  Thankyou- Current Viewer",1246147200,2,883,4.758169934640523
3886646,5,B002AMUD62,"It's teenage drama without the WB angst.
While, I am a very big fan of such things as Buffy, it's nice to see a teenager drama that's just fun. It has a a lot of heart and it's well written. And that has always been my biggest criteria for watching a show to begin with.
Jonathan Schiff is one of my favourites, He was the one who produced ""Ocean Girl"" an award-winning children's drama that was on 4 years back in 1994-98.
But another very strong part of any of his shows is friendship and loyalty. The girls who are now mermaids might not have been friends if it weren't for being mermaids, but they stick together. They also have the support of Lewis, a boy who has feelings for Cleo but both are too awkward for the expression of it, but he's got their back against those that try to expose them. Together, they are a team. They are friends. And they'd sacrifice everything for each other.

3886677,1,B002AMUD62,"I returned this the very same day that it arrived in my mailbox.
I was very disppointed to find that this only contains part of the first season. According to the folks at Amazon's customer service, there is almost no chance that the balance of the first season will ever be released by Amazon; not to mention the other 2 seasons of this great show.
Fortunately all of the episodes exist on both Netflix and Hulu so I can watch them there; but I would have loved to be able to throw a DVD in the machine whenever I wanted to see an episode of this great Australian TV program.",1320278400,3,576,4.245454545454545
3886678,5,B002AMUD62,The H2O series is a great show. My daughter and I love watching them over and over. Makes us wish we could become mermaids.,1320192000,,123,4.166666666666667
3886679,5,B002AMUD62,"This starts out with the Baptism of the girls, then we see some rejection, followed by reconciliation. The full moon over the volcano is the Eucharist over the Chalice. Catholics that would like to learn about their faith should get this series. The moon pool is their place of worship and becomes their home. At first the full moon is thought to be their enemy, because it changes them. But when they find they can trust the full moon, it bring them enhanced power and the girls become confirmed. This confirmation changes everything they thought about the full moon. Finally there is the salvation of the world. There is a modesty issue which should be addressed, but this should just give way to discussion, for all the other benefits of the series out weight the modesty issue. The series was extended for a year so some of the characters were lost, do to this another issue surfaces and that is the separation and remarriage of a lead characters father. We are not given the details of these events, so we should not assume the worst case and accept that it was handled properly. As we just add some water to the chalice at every Lamb's supper, we find this series teaching us just what that means.",1316131200,,1203,4.574074074074074
3886680,5,B002AMUD62,"I purchased this for my daughter's birthday.  Like others, I hesitated due to the item being DVD-R.  However, it was packaged nicely and the quality is good.  I would purchase later seasons if and when they come available.",1313193600,,222,4.7894736842105265
3886681,5,B002AMUD62,This Is A Fantastic Show and It deserves to have all the complete seasons available to the Shows viewers in the U.S. I have Season One Volume One thanks to the Super People at Amazon- and I hope Season One Volume Two in U.S.A.

3886682,5,B002AMUD62,"My daughter loves this show and she's actually quite young for teen shows (2nd grade) but needs more complexity in plots than most shows for her age group. She loves this and I'm not afraid of letting her watch it. Three friends who are mermaids trying to have ""normal"" lives in Australia without any of the typical teen angst, cursing, sex, drugs, and the edginess that has become so common on American television for teens. It's good, clean entertainment with interesting stories.",1309737600,3,482,4.890243902439025

3886684,5,B002AMUD62,"Okay, I don't wanna get in detail, but this DVD (set) contains the first 13 episodes of the first season, though 3 DVDs are in the set - the first five eps in disc 1, the next four in disc 2, and the final four in disc 3.

Great quality, I only wish they would add in some bonus features, but I guess that's to be expected when it's an Australian release.

All in all, buy it if you love the series! :)

(footnote: As with most others, I really hope that they release some more USA-formatted DVDs real soon. We can pretty much only hope that they have a few already lined up for release, and want to release some as a big DVD-blowout celebration thing. lol)",1293148800,,657,4.1171875

3886687,5,B002AMUD62,"I had some reservations when I first ordered this DVD-R fearing it might look like a bad dub (been there, done that).  However, I started to think there was no way Amazon would sell something like this independently (not a 3rd party seller) without the quality being top notch.  I'm very happy to report the quality is outstanding!  Everything from the packaging to the playback video/audio quality is first rate!  I can't believe this is supposed to be a DVD-R.  My daughter became hooked on this series during its brief two-season run on Nickelodeon.  We looked for a long time for Region One DVD versions of the series without any luck -- until recently.  Thanks to Amazon, she now has half of the first season of this family friendly outstanding drama-fantasy.  Now, we just need Amazon (or someone) to offer more H2O Just Add Water on DVD or DVD-R in Region One format.  Thanks again, Amazon!",1282089600,2,897,4.698717948717949
3886688,5,B002AMUD62,"This is my favorite show ever! I bought it straight away once I saw it finally came out on DVD in the USA.  My question is, when does the rest of Season 1 Voulume 2 come out on USA DVD (and Season 2!??) Because I really want to watch it and buy it!!! And I know so many others that also want to buy all the seasons of H2O Just Add Water on USA DVD! Please come out on DVD!
(Tell me when will the next volume come out!? beacuse I will buy it on USA DVD for any price!)
Please someone answer this!",1272067200,,495,3.7596153846153846

3886690,5,B002AMUD62,"AS U.S. FANS GOT JIPPED WHEN H2O WAS TAKEN OFF IN THE U.S. IN MARCH 2009 & ONLY AIRED 1 EPISODE A WEEK FOR MONTHS BEFORE THEN. IT'S GREAT TO SEE H2O BEGIN TO BE RELEASED ON DVD. HOPEFULLY THE REST OF SEASON 1, SEASON 2 WHICH U.S. FANS NEVER GOT TO SEE THE LAST 10 EPS. OF, AND SEASON 3 WHICH HASN'T AIRED IN THE U.S. WILL BE RELEASED ON DVD. SO ALL U.S. FANS WHO LOVE THIS SERIES WILL GET TO ENJOY IT AGAIN. H20 SEASON 1 VOLUME 1 HAS 13 EPISODES ON 3 DISC SO THERE IS A DECENT MOUNT OF EPISODES PER VOLUME. ALTHOUGH IT COST MORE BECAUSE IT'S A SPECIALTY ITEM IN THE U.S. ONLY SOLD HERE ON AMAZON.COM. EXCEPT FOR 1 SMALL PART IN THE BEGINNING OF 1 OF THE EPISODES WHERE THIS DISC SKIPS. THE DVDS PLAY GREAT AND THE PICTURE IS AS GOOD AS ON ANY STANDARD DVD EVEN THOUGH DVD-R DISC IS USE TO MAKE THE H2O DVD SETS.

3886692,5,B002AMUD62,"UPDATE 12/17: I have long since outgrown this show. It's cute but very cheesy and perfect for the younger set.

Previous review:
Ok, this is now up there with my top favorite shows! I'm obsessed with Mermaids and this show completely feeds my desire of returning to an underwater world. The three main characters are gorgeous young ladies, one more pretty than the next who make the show incredibly entertaining from start to finish. Of course you'll love them in their Mer form as well! Being an American it is so much fun to hear everyone's Australian accents on the show. Everything from the sets to the soundtrack is pure fun. I even bought the soundtrack by Kate Alexa the other day on iTunes. I SIMPLY CANNOT WAIT FOR VOLUME 2 and Season 2 to be released in Region 1 format; GET WITH THE PROGRAM AMAZON for Heaven sakes!",1254787200,7,826,4.543624161073826
3886693,2,B002AMUD62,"Was glad to see that Season 1 of the show got a Region 1 release, but what is incredibly disappointing is how it was released.  This is not a traditionally mastered DVD.  THE DISCS ARE DVD-R and the image quality reflects this type of mastering.  Be very careful with these recordable discs if you want to enjoy watching this release as time goes on.  This series deserves better.  Lets hope Season Two gets a proper release.",1249516800,11,425,4.5394736842105265
3886694,5,B002AMUD62,This series r one of my favorites too. This series r the best children tv show of all times. I watched every episode on nick but then nick in the second seson dropthem out.

3886695,4,B002AMUD62,"I am not a teenager, but I found this series by instant watching season one on Netflix.  I loved it, but now I want to watch season 2.  It is fun, uplifting, and easy watching. I have kids (but I watched it for me), and when they get old enough to be interested, I'd like to pull this series out for them.

8359788,4,B002AMUD62,"H2O: Season 1, Volume 1 was a 3-disc DVD-R set that contained the first half (just 13 episodes) of the Australian TV series H2O: Just Add Water. This set was released in 2009 from Nickelodeon, via Amazon's CreateSpace manufacture-on-demand program. The show is enjoyable for children and teenagers to watch. The only unfortunate thing was that no further follow-up DVD sets were made to finish off Season 1 or any for Seasons 2 and 3. This was the only DVD release for North America for this TV series at that point.

In 2012, New Video would release H2O: Just Add Water - The Complete Series DVD boxed set of all 3 seasons for North America, as well as offering all 3 Seasons as Individual sets. I still appreciated the old DVD-R set that Nickelodeon first offered.",1389312000,,766,4.632352941176471

8359790,5,B002AMUD62,"I really like h2o, its about 3 girls who try to keep there mermaid-ness a secret the reason I got this is because I kinda like the season with bella but I missed Emma so now I can watch Emma ana bella!  (Mostly Emma!!!!!)",1357084800,,221,4.0227272727272725
8359791,3,B002AMUD62,"Fairly cute TV show for tweens complete with the usual G-rated teen issues (including the snotty popular rich girl who thinks way too much of herself, and the rich bully a-hole guy), but for 3 girls there is an additional BIG problem - they have mysteriously become mermaids.  Just a tiny amount of water on them turns them into mermaids in seconds.  Naturally this is not a secret they want to share for fear of becoming scientific lab rats or worse.

The premise is interesting and entertaining, and there is nice footage underwater and beach footage.  The writing isn't too bad, (these kids seem to have an AMAZING amount of unsupervised free time)  -- the downside is that the acting leaves a lot to be desired (especially by Phoebe Tonkin ""Cleo"",  and Claire Holt ""Emma"")

Since I have just completed watching all the episodes pretty much back to back through end of season 3 (thanks to Amazon Prime), I can tell you that the acting does get a bit better -- and the show manages to keep being entertaining. You don't have to be a tween/teen to enjoy this show - I'm in my early 50's and enjoyed them.

BONUS PREVIEW REVIEW for season 2 - the acting gets better and the girls get some serious mermaid competition that ends in a showdown you'll enjoy.",1345334400,,1254,4.542222222222223
