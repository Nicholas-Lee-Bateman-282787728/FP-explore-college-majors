8742881,1,B018SU0D6Y,"This is the worst horsemanship DVD I've ever watched.
Martin Black and Dr Peters would have people buy into the fact that the only way to teach a horse anything is to frighten it silly. What they are condoning is brutal training.

I'm appalled and shocked.",1520553600,,414,4.928571428571429

It takes the mystery out of horse training and narrows it down to a very few basic principles!",1484179200,,262,5.261904761904762
