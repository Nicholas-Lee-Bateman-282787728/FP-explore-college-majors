1356172,5,B00004UEDZ,"In the summer of 1999, 3 gay drama films were released, ""Get Real"", ""Trick"" and ""Edge of Seventeen"".  By far  Edge of Seventeen is the BEST of the lot.  It is an honest and real story  that deals with the turbulent times of a gay youth's ""coming out""  experiance that is based on real life.  The story is delivered with  truth  , sensitivity and frankness.  The acting is wonderful, especially by Chris  Stafford as Eric Hunter and Lea deLaria as Angie. A MUST for anyone who  wants to see honesty and truth in a gay film, not just another ""fairy  tale"".",966729600,6,554,4.376237623762377
1356173,5,B00004UEDZ,"the first time i saw this movie i couldn't believe the similarities it had to my own experiences growing up gay in the eighties.  the uncertainties,  the confusion, the denial, the inabliity to believe in oneself.  i loved  the fact that this film had no actors i had ever seen before and that they  pulled it off so well:  almost all of the acting was very believable.  i  even thought the ending was very good, leaving the story up in the air,  which is the way many things seem when one's a teenager.  to have the story  wrap up neatly at the end would've been out of touch.  i highly recommend  this movie.  you don't have to have grown up in the eighties to relate to  much of this, but the music and clothes are from this era and this creates  an added relevance.",966384000,5,769,4.236111111111111
1356174,4,B00004UEDZ,"Many critics felt this film was cliched. But tell that to the mostly gay audience at the SF Gay and Lesbian Film Festival a couple of years ago when this film received a 5 minute ovation after its screening. For a straight  reviewer it may be cliched, but for anyone who came out in the 70's it is a  must see if for nothing else than a great Bronski Beat soundtrack and the  performance of Lea DeLaria.
If you liked Parting Glances or Get Real...  get this film!",964569600,14,463,4.2272727272727275
1356175,5,B00004UEDZ,"This film, to me at lease, was not just about dealing with being a gay teenager, is was about life in the 80's. Everything to the tacky taste in style to Madonna to even portable tape players. As a film dealing with gay  teenage life it is pefect. It deals with boyfriends, fake girlfriends,  coming out, dance clubs, and pain. Anyone who is gay, grew in the 1980's,  likes a good inde film or was a teenager will really enjoy this film.",962841600,7,437,4.304878048780488
1356176,4,B00004UEDZ,"This movie is a must for your gay movie collection. A very moving story about the coming out experience. Great performances even if the storyline is a little weak, nontheless well worth buying. Definately a movie you can  watch again and again. The movie deals with the hope and rejection of the  whole coming out experience.",962064000,6,325,4.785714285714286
1356177,5,B00004UEDZ,"Edge of Seventeen is a wonderfully realized coming-of-age film about the one teen trauma John Hughes never touched: coming out. To start with, the soundtrack is nothing short of spectacular for 80s nostalgia enthusiasts. And the costuming is eerily authentic (rumor has it that the screenwriter ransacked his own home closet to find his 80s club duds). Passing the fact that David Morton has managed to capture the feel of a Hughes teen flick (down to the great opening credits); the performances are the high point here. Chris Stafford will steal every gay Gen-Xers heart; both because he's adorably snuggleable without being implausably beautiful, and because playing a 16-yr old from the mid-80s, he's a stand-in for all of us who WISH we'd had the guts to go after the cute blond boy from our summer job (Anderson Gabrych). Of particular note is Lea Delaria supporting turn as the dyke den-momma; who provides the best possible example for how queer adults should treat queer kids. This is a film that's full of great moments (mostly dominated by Stafford), including a ""first-time"" love scene that will leave you twitchy with anticipation, and a rimming scene (move over, ""Queer as Folk"") that will have you rolling off the couch with laughter. Best of all is the fact that for a US-made gay-teen themed film, the plot finally seems to break past the level of ""Afterschool Special;"" enough for me to rank it above such gay film favorites as ""Beautiful Thing"" and ""Get Real."" For American queerboys who came of age in the 80s, this is as real as it gets (or as close to what we wanted in our teen years as we'll find now.) It's a must-have for your collection.",961977600,41,1664,4.7612456747404845
1356178,5,B00004UEDZ,"I enjoyed this film so much that I saw it three times at the theater.  The film centers around Eric, a typical seventeen year old that discovers he's gay due to an attraction that he has for a fellow co-worker named Rod.  This attraction leads Eric on a journey of self-discovery and sexual  awakening. Sometimes funny and sometimes poignant.  This film realistically  captures one young man's coming-out experience.  What else can I say?  This  is a great film.",961977600,3,462,4.833333333333333

1356180,5,B00004UEDZ,"I've always been curious about this movie. I remember when I saw it on YouTube before and it thrilled me. Set back to 1984, that was one part that kept me happy, another part; the chemistry between the two boys. I did buy the movie and it's totally addictive when the chemistry between them is thrilling and exhilarating. Eric couldn't deny that he was totally attracted to Rod. Just wish that Rod could've given the chance to be with Eric after the summer was over. Through the movie, Eric may have gone through difficulties with the facts of being gay, but he satisfied with that fact and it was so heartbreaking to see him come out to his mother. Angie; was there to guide him that there'd be ups and downs of being what he is and I believe she has a big heart. There's just one part of the movie of scene I refuse to see. It shouldn't have happened because it wasn't going to change him, the truth is he's gay. Plus the music had me attached; Toni Basil, Eurythmics, Bronski Beat, A Flock of Seagulls, Missing Persons and much more. Kept me thrilled, I could even think of more songs that could fit real good for the movie as it's set in '84-'85. Just wish there were more thrilling scenes with the boys.",1468713600,,1208,4.349557522123894

1356182,5,B00004UEDZ,"As an out gay man, who was born in '66, I turned 18 in the summer of '84. This movie is an astonishing time capsule, from the clothes to the music to the dialogue...it was really like this. Unless you lived in a big city back then, anyone or anything openly gay was hard to find. The music Eric listened to, the way he looked, his mannerisms....back then that was considered VERY gay. The performances in this movie are superior to most gay themed movies, and Eric's mom was just like the majority of moms. Angie the lesbian bar owner was such so hilarious, yet she was sweet and had such a deep serious side, you seldom get performances like this. The sex scenes were well done, and Eric asking Rod to use a condom might have saved his life. AIDS was everywhere in the news then, it was really scary. I'm one of the lucky ones who never got any std's. Too bad Rod turned out to be such a scumbag, he was hot (even with the severely bleached hair!).

1356188,5,B00004UEDZ,"Loved this movie years ago when it first appeared on DVD; now with this crisp, beautifully restored new edition, I love it that much more!
Just about everything clicks in this entertaining, enchanting gay coming of age comedy drama.  A remarkable first feature film achievement from the producers: David Moreton (director) and Todd Stephens (screenwriter).
Wonderful evocation of working class small city life (Sandusky, Ohio) and faultless rendering of the period (1984) through keen observation, fashion (fantastic threads on display) and music (truly fabulous soundtrack).
Impeccable acting from the entire cast adds to the realism and honesty of this independent film. Chris Stafford as the gawky, sexually confused teenager who matures into a trendy, assured young gay man is terrific.  As best friend (and potential fiance), Tina Holmes is just right in a very difficult role. Andersen Gabrych as the sexy seducer Rod and Lea Delaria as lesbian Angie, both in showy but beautifully etched roles, help solidify the film with their brilliant performances.  Equally good is Stephanie McVay as the mother whose unfulfilled dreams of a music career are now transferred to her eldest son.
As Eric discovers, there are all sorts of hurdles to clear when you're a teenager, especially when you are coming to terms with your sexuality. This film doesn't shy away from any of these complexities.  Special mention of the sex scenes which are handled in an amusing but honestly frank way which always ring  true.  A feel good movie but one with the satisfaction of well rounded characters, believable story and substance.
A mention of the extras on the disc.  There are 26 minutes of deleted scenes which are fun to watch but emphasize the importance of wise editing to bring the film in at the perfect running time of 103 minutes. Also included is a 47 minute discussion between Moreton and Stephens, detailing the making of the film.  Could have been juiced up considerably with the enhancement of clips or stills as the filmmakers insights are very enlightening but do tend to ramble on a bit.",1455321600,8,2090,5.072886297376093
1356189,3,B00004UEDZ,"I think it depends where you are in your journey as to whether you will like this film or not. It came out in 1998 and there weren't as many such flicks as there are now so it was important for it's time. But a young kid or adult who is struggling through this process now might get a lot from it. I was in my early 20's and lived in Sandusky for a brief time during the early 80's and rented an apartment across the street from what I eventually noticed was called the Universal Fruit and Nut Company. Every day I would pass this place and wonder why there were cars only parked there at night. Why were they only packing fruits and nuts at night??? I eventually discovered it was a gay bar and laughed out loud at the name. This became my haunt and I met my then ""lover"" (old term these days) Bob who was the DJ. I felt very isolated in that small town but there were many, many very nice people. We moved on from Sandusky to Zanesville and then Columbus where he cheated on me and we split up. Aw but every dark cloud has a silver lining because it prompted me to move to paradise (Los Angeles) where I've lived ever since! ;-)",1455062400,,1130,4.094594594594595

What is ther not to like about this movie. Chris Stafford as the boy in question is excellent. He's is just discovering himself to the absolute confusion of his mom and girlfriend. At the end of junior year in Sandusky Ohio, he takes a summer job at an amusement park and meets ""the one"" he goes off to college and gets on with his life and leaves Eric pining for him. This is a sweet, sincere, lovely film that left one thing hanging in the air for me, Mom's reaction. I loved Mom at the start and then.....Lea Delaria is his really best friend and what more do we need? The parking lot of the bar in the car scene....priceless.",1435536000,,770,4.507142857142857

And the parallels certainly don't end there. I watch this movie at least twice a year, and it never fails to move and amuse me. Chris Stafford is pitch perfect in the lead. No one could have been better. One wishes he was still acting, but I gather he's a civil rights lawyer, and I'll bet he's won every case that's come his way. I should add that I was the editor of several leading gay publications for a number of years, so if my standing as a ""professional gay man"" lends any more weight to my opinion here, all the better.

1356200,5,B00004UEDZ,"This is the most honest gay film that I've ever seen.  It might not resonate with many gay teenagers now, but it perfectly describes the difficulties of coming out in the 1970s and 1980s.  The screwed up relationship with your best friend, the aging barflies (and year-round Christmas decorations) at the only bar in town, your first sexual encounters which you hope will be romantic and end up just being tricks.  Not to mention the fact that more of us were outed rather than outing ourselves back in those days.  This film about a confused teenager in a working class milieu says much more about real gay experiences than better-known gay films where everyone seems to own a huge summer home on the lake and all the characters are gym bunnies with medical degrees.",1421020800,,767,4.701492537313433
1356201,5,B00004UEDZ,"It's funny how one of the blurbs about the movie calls it ""a quintessential 80's film"" despite the fact it was released in 1998. But the movie really does capture the era quite well, as especially helped along by the key role that the music played in things. Making Eric very into the music of the time nicely rounded out things and gave the movie a distinct character without resorting to caricature of the period.

One could argue that the movie tends to follow the formula of various coming of age movies of this nature. We have the initial discovery of the protagonist's sexuality followed by the budding exploration of the gay world. And you have the complex first love (unrequited of course) and the mother getting a clue and all that jazz.

And despite this seeming to be a relatively classic story, it was told in a manner that kept things distinct, but also very raw and real. And while my own experiences in the closet weren't necessarily similar to what Eric went through, I could totally imagine being in Eric's shoes. I could feel his struggle and his constant internal conflict as he tried to figure out precisely what he was. He was obviously finding guys attractive and yet he also had strong feelings for his best friend Maggie and just trying to puzzle through all that can be quite a lot to handle.

I appreciated the modest mentor role that Angie represented in this movie. Sure, she was a side character and it's easy to limit her to a part of the background or something, but in many ways it was thanks to her that Eric found the strength to keep on with his initial explorations of the queer scene. And during that period when any young gay man tries to take those first few steps out into the world, sometimes that one helping hand is all that's needed.

So maybe my enjoyment of this movie had a lot more to do with an odd sense of nostalgia or something like that, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The movie had a story to tell, one that that is familiar to a lot of us. And the story was told in a manner that helped keep the story pretty vibrant and real and it certainly triggered an emotional response in me. And I think it's fair to think that this a reaction that more than a few of you might feel as well.

Edge of Seventeen is a poignant little piece that isn't all roses but it's certainly not overly dark either. At the end of the day it's the story of a boy becoming a man and perhaps a whole lot more - and it's a story worth telling.",1420588800,,2479,4.334051724137931

1356205,5,B00004UEDZ,"Stafford's character has a girl friend, but he is turned by a charming and good looking guy he meets at his new job at an amusement park for the Summer. Stafford's quick and naive entry into his notions and expectations of the gay lifestyle eventually sets him up for a fall. This charmer turns out to be shallow and only looking for one night stands.

An honest film that is also a bit funny thanks to the film's supporting character, Barbie Marie. It is a wonderfully simple and nostalgic film on its surface, yet beautifully complex. Too many of the old gay film plots are weighed down by the specter of HIV or AIDS. Fortunately, more recent gay films finally deal just with the characters and gay relationships.

While on the subject, I must highly recommend two other gay films. The Trick and Parting Glances. These are, hands down, the two finest gay films ever made. They are the gold standard from which you will judge all other gay genre films. I promise!",1403654400,,964,4.566473988439307

I am from that era and the film captures the state of being a young gay man beautifully.  It truly is a gay version of the John Hughes films, except with a true depth of emotion.  Some have complained about gay cliches, but I assure you that it is an accurate portrayal of those times.  Gay people of all stripes rubbed up against each other in gay clubs.  I have just rewatched the movie (saw it when it was originally released) and it remains as touching today as it was then.  I highly recommend this film.",1363996800,,661,4.198412698412699

It was great seeing a younger Tina Holmes (star of ""Shelter"") playing the proverbial love starved best female friend of a young gay man who finally comes to realize that she can never have the kind of love and affection she wants from him.

Chris Stafford as Eric beautifully portrays all the pain, passion and disappointment that was part of his coming out process.  The movie is well paced, and not a single frame is wasted on peripheral nonsense that is of no value to the film's central development.

The imagery in the movie is very nostalgic, and the music is crazy good.  The lead, played marvelously by Chris Stafford, is a character most gay kids can relate to.  The film makers did a terrific job of crafting a storyline that plops the lead character smack dab in the middle of 1984, his journey to self awareness, and his interaction with his family and friends.

It is so well done and so well produced it's uncanny!  Clothing, vehicles, music - everything.  Interior scenes.  It is EXACTLY what it was like in the 80's!  And the antics the lead character goes through were so similar to what I went through it was scary!  I just kept thinking over and over again, ""That's Me!"" The wild 80's clothes.  Bleaching the hair.  It was like watching a mirror reflection of my teenage years.

Coming out in the 80's wasn't easy and it sure as hell wasn't accepted!  It sure as hell wasn't as easily obtained either!  You did have to go on body language or eye movement or whatever.  There was no internet or dating websites or any of that crap.  The only way you knew who was gay was by word of mouth.  Just figuring it all out on your own and there was a certain beauty to that.  With today's internet, ANYTHING you have ever had a thought about is within 2 clicks of a mouse - BAM!  Right there on your computer screen.  There's no guesswork or fumbling.  You know it all before you even get out and try it.

The 80's was the last of the ""innocent"" eras.  Watching this movie my chin was on the ground because it was so realistic and it was so interesting to think, ""Wow!  I had that sweater!""  or ""Wow!  I had that record!""  The ""new wave"" music that was used is EXACTLY the same music I listened to back then which was considered ""gay"".  It was interesting to see that the same things you thought or experienced, somebody else did too during that era.  Coming from small town America it was thrilling to watch this movie and see the similarities even in a larger city.  And I even worked in an amusement park too!  So it REALLY was like telling the story of my life.  Cute, funny, serious - it handles all the topics tastefully and very well.  KUDOS!",1349568000,,1930,4.248618784530387
1356234,5,B00004UEDZ,"This Film is as simple as it can and should be. The situation is becoming more and more common. A teenager, a junior in his high school, discovers little by little he is attracted to men. He has a girl friend who would like the relation to go all the way, but he does not bring it there which makes him start wondering.

Then he is thrown into the gay world by accident, the way most things happen in life. His first man is a sweet and maybe slightly weak predator, a senior in his high school, and a colleague at his summer workplace. The young junior falls and the senior goes to college in September. Eric will have to live alone with his recollection, his desire and the demand from his mother and society to have a normal life with a girl friend and all the rest that goes along with it. Maggie will play what she still does not know is a game.

Then all that happens is accidental till it becomes a real choice. Later he will run away from a straight party when he is called a queer because he dances in a rather exuberant way. He goes to a gay night club or bar where he meets someone. The next stage later on will be to run after his first male lover and to get it finished physically and emotionally: right through to the end of the physical act and to the final closure of the emotional experience.

Then he will try to go back to a normal straight life and have a night with his girl friend, Maggie. But in the morning he will feel no satisfaction, no fulfillment. He will know then lying is no solution and he will move towards telling his mother and then going back to where he finds his full both physical and emotional nourishment.

The film is then interesting because it describes the slow change that occurs in Eric with total sympathy and even empathy. Eric is living what practically all human beings have lived or deserve living: the slow awakening of desire and search for satisfaction of that desire, the desire to be appealing to someone else, the desire to answer to the ones who are appealing to him, the desire to feel happy and satisfied when he meets with that mutual appeal which is first of all a strong emotion that becomes a passion. Then the physical act is like natural.

This is not typical of gay men, but any man feels that transformation no matter who is the object of the nascent passion. I guess it is also the same thing for women though the film does not insist on the case of the Lesbian friend of Eric's and only shows the deception and frustration of Maggie when she realizes her appeal has been hijacked by Eric.

This film insists on the role of the mother that moves from open hostility to acceptance without the know-how required by such a disquieting situation. If the mother accepts her son's choice, she will have to defend him and it when confronted to the dubitative hostility of other parents, not to speak of the open hostility of other teenagers, some school officials, PTA members, church representatives, etc.

A good film on the problem and necessity to come out as soon as the appeal starts moving in you, though you need a confident, an accomplice, someone who understands and supports you in that transformation. Coming out is hard.

The production values are so consistently high and the acting so competent it is difficult to consider this any less than a main stream film.  After watching so many independent movies which suffer from so many mistakes and play like amateur productions, it was totally refreshing to come across this movie.  It pulled me into the story line and kept me there till the very end.  The young lead actor was nothing short of amazing.  His performance was so believable, emotions so real, his portrayal laced with fine little nuances that I never even for a moment felt disconnected with his character. The film also captures the feel of small town midwestern America in the 80's. One of the better gay-themed movies out there and highly recommended.",1326585600,,801,4.782608695652174

Sandusky isn't exactly a ""hick town in the Midwest"" as a Netflix reviewer noted when they thought the protagonist's hair & clothing were unrealistic.

In my mind - he was perfect.

All kids in the mid-late 80s dressed like that, peroxided their hair, (straight) boys in eyeliner... it was perfect. The story was well written, poignant and really easy to relate to as a coming of age story. I liked this one!",1316563200,,664,4.382113821138211

Anyway, I can say without doubt that the movie felt realistic and it was not at all exaggerated. The story of Eric trying to understand himself and his feelings, with all the trouble this self-searching can bring along if it's done in an age when you are still so unsure of everything, is probably the ordinary discovery journey a teenager undertakes, gay, lesbian or heterosexual. The second point I like of the movie is that, even if the plot is realistic, it's also romantic. Sure, Eric is not so lucky with his first love, but how many of us can say the same? Rod is a necessary stop in Eric's travel towards adulthood and maybe in retrospective Eric will be happy to have met him. Eric is innocent and romantic, but also a little bit horny, and Rod is a college student who probably doesn't want to commit to anything serious yet. Sure Eric will suffer for this unrequited love, but nothing his teenager heart will not be able to bear. Edge of Seventeen is a story about a teenager in love, who happens to be gay and so probably he has some trouble more than his same age fellow teenagers.",1299974400,,1306,4.35655737704918
1356240,5,B00004UEDZ,"Every time I watch this movie, it really amazes me how much it looks like it was filmed in 1984. Such is the attention to detail, the costumes, the props, the fantastic music, the acting, everything. And it's a gay movie to boot! Filmed in the most professional manner possible, don't expect cheap camera work, screenwriting or acting. Everything here is top-notch. Also, you don't have busy star performances, you probably won't have ever seen or heard about most actors in this movie, and that may be a good thing, nothing will distract you while watching it.
That doesn't mean bad acting, guys: everyone here from the stars to the extras are incredibly professional and it's pure joy to be able to say that.
I can't help but think that all these are things that you usually take for granted, but they are usually not all things you can say about the same movie! Think about it! :)
The movie doesn't shy away from touchy subjects and could-be uncomfortable moments either but they are dealt in such great manner that they are not uncomfortable to watch, and make you think about what is going on.
Like a previous reviewer said, this could have been a John Hughes movie (you know, the guy who did those wonderful cult high school movies in the 80s) filme right in the mid eighties.
All the rest has already been stated, to perfection, by the most-helpful reviews.
If you think you are interested in some of the aspects of this movie by reading the reviews or the plot, buy it, you will NOT regret it.

Chris Stafford, as the naive lead, is every bit as adorable as Molly Ringwald in ""Sweet Sixteen"",if not more so in his portrayal of heartbreaking innocence.

1356244,5,B00004UEDZ,"To me, watching this movie is like watching a friend coming out on the screen....  It's believable and it's painful because of that.  If&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Line-of-Beauty/dp/B000GIXLX4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Line of Beauty</a>&nbsp;is a movie that covers a broad ""gay experience"", then Edge of Seventeen would be a film that speaks to me in a more intimate level.

Now here's the review of the movie.  Eric (played by Chris Stafford) is in a state of sexual confusion who eventually hurt people who care about him and foremost, himself.  Despite the fact I grew up in the 90's, I think many of the growing pain of a homosexual man is still relevant (but given the feedback from some reviews, apparently kids from 2000's aren't going through the same sort of pain).  Eric has gone through a lot of stuff I can relate to: expressing himself through fashion and hairdo, feeling lost, enduring indignation with silence (what else could you do?), looking for love from both genders (but only going back to feeling lost again).  The movie nailed every important subject in the process of coming to term of finding self.

To those who couldn't find the point of the movie, let me offer this: not everyone can go to one of his parents and just say ""Mom, I'm gay"" without a long suffocating process.  I don't see the movie as a gay man trying to find love, but a coming-of-age movie of a man coming to term to who he is.  Things like experimenting on hair style, putting on make up, going to gay bar, sleeping with guys, sleeping with his best female friend (!)..., etc., are all small (but not insignificant) details that eventually builds up to the final conclusion.

I personally feel The Edge of Seventeen to be a very frank story that deserves to be noticed, but Strand Releasing (the publisher of this DVD) did a terrible job at market placement, I think.  I avoided this film because I had judged the movie by its cover....  However, it turned out to be much better than expected.  Like another reviewer mentioned, one may think this is an uplifting movie, but it's not....  I am guessing Strand probably believed marketing the movie this way may boost sale, but it pleases no one.  Honesty sells.  This is not a pastel colored love story, but a brutally honest coming out story, so why disappoint someone who are looking for a Friday fun, while turn off others who are looking for a serious love story?  Target the customer correctly, please.

To Strand's credit, they generally publish good quality movies.  This and The Mudge Boy both offer stellar acting performance with strong scripts.  Chris Stafford should win an award for his role.  The script is believable and honest.  I didn't expect a good movie when I first started, but it ended up making me insomniac that night because it reached that deep hole of my life that I thought I had long forgotten.

This movie also proves that there are two main types of gays and it is really difficult, painful, complex and unnerving when those two types of gays come together; moreover, the harsh reality of a family's typical reaction--independent of how a gay may be categorized--in particular, the mother.  Given that this movie achieves a wonderful depiction of the truths of the gay community, this movie is still very relevant today.  I was not conscious of the fact that this movie was done more than 20 years ago...well, I must admit, you can't really be oblivious to Eric's Boy George-like, 80's punk look! lol  :)  Albeit, this is the qunitessential ""coming out"" movie.  This movie does a very nice job of portraying the typical struggles of a gay guy in Eric's situation without over-indulging in some of the more profound aspects of the story; ergo, a drawn-out, almost unbelievable film. It also, I believe, evokes thoughts for young gays that are [hopefully] conducive to the establishment of tenets of the gay community.  Some examples of these tenets would be: not to be promiscuous (as it is asinine and totally unsafe), don't judge others--as you don't want anyone judging you, never love under any pretense--thus it isn't love in the first place, accept change--you must eventually do this if you are to be comfortable and strong in being gay.

And the fashions, hairstyles, and music (scored by none other than 80's pop icon Tom Bailey of ""the Thompson Twins"") are a true blast from the past. This film resonated with me strongly, for on that same year, I was going thru what Eric (played with sweet sincerity by Chris Stafford) was experiencing: confused attractions towards both genders, the ""first time"" with another guy, gay culture shock, and finally, acceptance for who I was (although I never went as far as Eric did with the ""androgynous"" look!). The acting & situations seem more firmly rooted in ""real"" time, as if you're right there witnessing what Eric's going thru. The emotions seem more raw here, unlike other films where the actors seem to be grabbing for that paycheck.

The main character's downward spiral/transformation into Boy George is trite and tired.  I was so not impressed with all the costume, set, and prop nods to the '80s.  Okay, so maybe I'm just not a ""period"" guy.

But the story goes on from one lurching and achingly painful misstep to another.  Could he have possibly made any more mistakes?  This is a white, middle-class, well-supported, talented guy with a loving family.  He even has a boss (Lea DeLaria) who spoon-feeds him gaydom.  Yet he STILL can't even tell his doting best friend that he's gay, and keeps telling her that he's not?  And he STILL can't tell his mother and in fact tells her that he is not?

I wasn't thrilled about the end either which felt one part unreconciled and another part easy happy ending.

Dramas about _Teenage Gays Coming Out Of The Closet!_ are so plentiful, they sometimes run together in my mind.  ""Edge of Seventeen"" is an exception to that statement because it genuinely is an exceptional movie in every way.  The screenplay by Todd Stephens is sensitive and true to life, or rather, many people's lives.  It tells the story of Eric (Chris Stafford), a young man growing up in the small town of Sandusky, Ohio, who is just beginning to grapple with his sexual orientation.  What is so refreshing about the script is that Eric is portrayed as neither a victim nor a hero; he's simply a kid on the cusp of adulthood who is trying to find himself.  Eric is sometimes selfish and thoughtless; other times sweet and naive; occasionally manipulative; but generally a good guy ... in other words: completely human.  That holds true of the other characters in the movie, including Eric's parents who love him dearly but aren't quite sure what to make of his fast-changing moods and appearance; his female best friend (Tina Holmes) who harbors deeper feelings for him; and his new gay ""family"" (headed by Lea DeLaria) who are fiercely supportive, yet sometimes insensitive to where he is at in terms of his coming out process.  Thankfully, Stephens' screenplay remains true to itself right down to the final fadeout and doesn't cop out by trying to wrap everything up into a neat little package; at the end of the movie, there's a definite sense that these characters will continue to live, learn, make mistakes, and thrive.  (Sequel, anyone?)

The entire cast is uniformly outstanding.  Chris Stafford embodies Eric in all his complexity; his performance never strikes a false note.  Tina Holmes is amazing as his confused female friend; more than once her face and vocal inflections reminded me of an extremely young Meryl Streep (a high compliment indeed).  Stephanie McVay distinguishes herself as Eric's baffled mother, and Andersen Gabrych is fine as Eric's first same sex crush whose confident veneer covers a troubled heart.  Perhaps best of all is comic Lea DeLaria, who turns in a warm and winning dramatic performance as the Earth Mother whose wisdom and understanding are always available to Eric, regardless of how hard he sometimes pushes her away.

The Strand DVD offers a flawless letterboxed transfer featuring outstanding audio and video.  The somewhat sparse extras are limited to the Theatrical Trailers for ""Edge of Seventeen"" and five other feature films designed to appeal to LGBT audiences.  It would be wonderful to have the additional benefit of cast and crew biographies and filmographies as a reasearch tool for the viewers who want to explore others works by the filmmakers, but this is a small complaint.  Overall, this is truly a must-see film, one that is worthy of repeat viewings.",1103155200,9,2873,4.983228511530398

1356262,4,B00004UEDZ,"I couldn't believe what I was watching.  Being from a small town not far from Sandusky, OH, where ""Edge of Seventeen"" is set, seeing this film was almost like reliving my teenage years, just before coming out.  Even the way Eric finally admits to his best friend that he's gay was the same.  ""I like guys"".  It was hard back then for me to say the word ""gay"".  Whenever I would reveal this to a new friend or coworker, I always said, ""I like guys"".  It seemed to go over better.  Set in the 80's, a time when new wave music and fashion blurred the line between male and female even more than the hair bands of a few years later, ""Edge of Seventeen"" is a charming, funny and, sometimes, heartbreaking story of a young man discovering his sexuality.  His surrounding cast of characters reminded me of almost everyone I knew back then.  I read a review where someone accused this movie of furthering the ""gay stereotype"".  I disagree.  If you're from a small town, and you came out in small town, ""Edge of Seventeen"" will take you back.  It will remind you of the struggles you faced in admitting you were gay, first to yourself and then to others.  It will remind you of the excitement and horror you simultaneously felt the first time you were in gay bar.  It will remind you of all those stories you told your parents just so you could stay out all night.  Chris Stafford is nothing less than amazing as Eric.  He truly conveys the innocence, frustration, pain and, eventually, relief that many teenagers go through when coming to terms with their sexuality.  It's almost as though he's drawing on his own experiences.  Lea DeLarla nearly steals the film as the owner of possibly the sole gay club in Sandusky.  A club populated by characters we can all remember from our first gay bar.  In short, ""Edge of Seventeen"" is a scrapbook for anyone who came out in a small town and in the 80's.  And the soundtrack is pretty good, too.",1089244800,6,1930,4.457142857142857
1356263,5,B00004UEDZ,"I decided to write this review after seeing the director's latest effort ""Gypsy 83."" Edge of Seventeen is a true-to-life (almost) account of coming out, with so many of the milestones all gay men go through at one point or another, many of them milestones that all people, gay or straight, have to face during the painful process of growing up and realizing who you are.
The reason this movie resonated so intensely with me is that, quite frankly, if you fast forward fifteen years into the future you have an account of my coming out experience.

Most movies require at least some suspension of disbelief and some empathy for unfamiliar experiences, for me; not this movie. When I followed Eric on his journey towards self-acceptance, I only had to think back and realize that his journey was one I had taken not very long before. I found myself wishing that it would be different for him, that it would have a nice, neat, happy ending; but at the same time knowing that - like most of us, so I like to think - he would come out a stronger, better person.
In short, the film's unwavering honesty and refusal to tie the scattered mess of life into a Hollywood-style conclusion makes it one to own and cherish.",1085961600,2,1209,4.545871559633028

This beautifully directed and scripted coming-out film boasts a fabulous cast(including a tender performance by Lea DeLarla), beauitiful acting, and startling reality.

I like the film however, if you are looking for some light entertainment, this would not fit the bill. If your looking for hard reality and depth of emotion, this will do the trick.""No pun intended""",1046217600,,461,4.25
1356266,5,B00004UEDZ,"Every now and then a film comes along that captivates you from start to finish - ""Torch Song Trilogy"" was one of the first that did that for me.  ""Edge of Seventeen"" did it again.  Maybe it's because I was 18 going on 19 when this film, set in 1984, took place.  Like Eric from Sandusky Ohio, I too grew up in a small town along the New Jersey shore.  And like the film's star, I too listened to music of the 80's and knew I was indeed ""different"".
You need to buy or at least rent this film if you are male, especially a gay male, a woman, especially a woman who is the friend of a gay man, you're someone in your 20's, 30's or 40's and/or you ever knew someone that was gay.  It's also a great film if you ever struggled with who you are, where you came from or faced discrimination in your life for any reason.  I think that covers just about everyone now.
Films like this are rare.  And even more rare, is the fact that none of the major networks will even probably consider carrying it - what a loss.  I'm sure if the film centered on a heterosexual male, the closeted programming people in Hollywood would jump on it.  Funny how Hollywood works, for if it weren't for so many gay and lesbian actors and actresses, where would Hollywood be? But I digress.
As for the film?  It follows 17-year old Eric as he deals with his sexuality.  He lives in at home with Mom, Dad and his brothers.  He listens to music by Annie Lennox and Bronski Beat, songs he can relate too.  He has a dear female friend who, unfortunately has feelings for him that he'll never truly have for her.  Eric's room is adorned with posters of Billy Idol (I think I had the same one in my college dorm), and a photo of New Yorks City's skyline, eerily showing the World Trade Center towers.  Eric dreamed of attending music school in New York City.  His struggles in school, at work, and in relationships are near and dear to us all.  Like so many of us during the ""coming out"" years, Eric encounters the same prejudices, the same stereotypes and the same hurt.  And like anyone who has ever loved or been loved, Eric deals with the challenges of any relationship as it relates to the heart, and sex.  And tries to understand the difference.  What is most interesting as I watched this film (again set in 1984), is the parallels to today, nearly 20 years later.  Is it really that much easier for a 17 year old youth to come out to family and close friends without fear of losing those close to him or her?
The film runs 1 minute shy of 100 minutes.  And if you edited out about 9 of those minutes (tops), and a few words, the film is ready for television, not that you'll probably ever see on anything other then Bravo or IFC.  I honestly found the film riveting, finding myself in his shoes on so many occasion's.  We need films like this to remind our youth that they are not alone, and they will be ok, no matter who they are.
To be fair, a good review should always include some critique, if one is so deserving.  The ending, wrapped up in about 15 minutes includes Eric coming out to his Mom, and visiting the local nightclub, where his friend Angie (played by Lea Delaria), dedicates a song to her special friend.  The ending was a little too Brady Bunch sitcom.  But I won't let it take away from an otherwise excellent film, which earns 5 stars in my book.",1039824000,24,3339,4.258730158730159

Despite the mid- to low-production quality, despite a little over-acting at times, Edge of Seventeen is a realistic portrayal of gay youth coming out in almost any time in the last few decades. And one can well imagine that a gay bar in Ohio in the mid-80s would be peopled with such characters as the young Eric meets there--the drag queen, the bar flies who enjoy watching the vultures swoop in on young Eric. The way in which he was used and tossed aside by older more jaded gay men was painful, and I kept waiting for him to ""get it."" But somehow, up until the last scene he allowed himself to continue his rather foolish behavior. The joy of watching this film is to see how Eric's parents, especially his mother, come to understand that he's rapidly changing; their supportive role is refreshing and realistic for those lucky gay teens who have parents who love without reservation. --Ronald L.

The 80's soundtrack transported me back to a time when I was first coming out, and you just couldn't help but be right there with the title charactor as he started realizing who he was.
Lea DeLaria gave an unexpectedly awesome performance as Eric's supervisor, and later, good friend and psuedo counselor.

1356274,5,B00004UEDZ,"This is a very powerful gay coming-out film, unlike others in its directness, simplicity and honesty. This is not a coming-out tale told thru rose-colored glasses. It's not a romance.
""Edge of Seventeen"" depicts the coming-out of 17 year old Eric Hunter in Sandusky, OH, in 1984. The cast overall is not as stellar as, say, ""Beautiful Thing"" or ""Lilies,"" or several other very good gay films, but most of them have very minor roles, anyway. Of those that are crucial to the story, Chris Stafford deserves a statuette for his portrayal of Eric, nailing just about every nuance of emotion such a boy would go through, though he has a tendency to giggle at times when I think a soft moan would be more appropriate. Tina Holmes gives a wonderful performance as his steadfast girl friend, Maggie, and Stephanie McVay is excellent as Everymom. Lea Delaria perhaps brings some cachet to the film as a gay icon, but I would have preferred the role to be filled by a non-celebrity. Celebrity actors usually make better contributions to films if they play against type, if they have the acting skills to do it. Andersen Gabrych is creepily perfect as Rod, the college stud who knows Eric is attracted to him before Eric does and intends to use that knowledge to his personal satisfaction in every way he can.
The directing, camera work and editing are accomplished if not exciting or groundbreaking. The 80s was a nothing decade for me musically, so the soundtrack does nothing for me.
There are some rather explicit scenes, though nothing XXX; they will probably be a little discomforting for some straights and some gays, tho for different reasons.
Unlike most gay films, the bad guys in ""Edge of Seventeen"" are not the homophobes, who are very inconsequential, nor a father who is unsupportive, nor any of the other usual suspects, but various gay characters, all too true to life, whom Eric encounters in his ""Summer of '84."" Number 1, of course, is Rod ('wham, bam, thank you little boy'). Number 2 is the predator who hits on Eric on his first visit to a gay bar ('wham, bam, slurp, ""Whatever""'). Then there are the various jaded queens at the bar, latter day 'Boys in the Band' wannabees who can't wait to have Eric find out what 'It's Really All About, sweetie.' We all know all these characters.
Roger Ebert stupidly concludes Eric can't wait to be a slut. But Ebert is right that the film doesn't present a single positive male homosexual character.
Nevertheless Eric survives his rites of initiation into the gay bar scene, and seems to be stabilizing happily at the end, which is otherwise a bit vague and cliche.
The scenes in which Eric struggles with coming out to his Mom and then does are heart-rending and among the most moving in gay cinema, as is his coming out to Maggie.
Despite my minor quibbles, I put this film on my very short list of 5-Star rated, excellent gay films. It is not to be missed. I will be looking forward to seeing more of Chris Stafford in future films, even if they're not about gay subjects.",1014163200,,3025,4.6560747663551405
1356275,4,B00004UEDZ,"This teenaged gay coming-out story is very special, not only because it captures the coming-out experiences of those who were teenagers during the mid-1980s (with particular music, fashions, language, etc.) but also because of its universal appeal and truths.  Gay people who came out in any decade can relate to the innocent hero's romantic hopes that his first lover will be his last, while his older seducer is far more interested in acquiring as many notches to his bedpost as he can muster.  Naturally, our hero is disillusioned and wishes to return to the closet, a solution that is ultimately not viable.  There is a sense of honesty about the film that suggests that it is based on autobiography, and perhaps, here is where the trouble lies.  Despite this film's being far more realistic than most gay coming-out movies, which are heavier on idyllic romance, this movie loses momentum at the end.  Construction-wise, there is no genuine climax (our hero's unsatisfactory attempt to make love to a female friend and then his coming out to a mother who is unable to cope does not make a climax).  And lacking a climax, the movie can't have a satisfactory ending.  The fact that our hero has forsworn the local gay bar for a time, and now returns, is not a workable resolution.  Even so, the movie is a real charmer -- sensitively directed and with an exceptional cast.

I came out in 1985.  Though I was in college, not high school, in 1984, this film could be the story of my life.  I would be Eric.  The one charging head first into the gay scene only to be used and feel like I was taken advantage of.  The story is so realistic and so true to my coming out, I couldn't help but love this movie. The use of music to set the time and place was powerful.
The fact that this film is low budget and an indie makes this film feel so much more honest in the portrayal of everything.  It feels so real.
The relationship between Eric and Rod, Eric and Maggie, Eric and his mother are all mirror images of scenes from my life.  While the acting is at times a little ""naive"", it seems to work well.  The movies flows so well, there is never a dull moment.  This is a fun movie, though it shows a difficult topic.  Though I had heard many times from many people, that we gay men all had similar coming out experiences, it never hit home until I saw this movie.  The fact that someone could make a movie like this tells me that I wasn't alone in what I was thinking or feeling.
I saw this film for the first time when I was 36 years old.  I saw it on the closing night of the Gay and Lesbian Festival in Rochester, NY.  The movie felt like a validation of my life.  I felt so incredibly good about myself after seeing this film, I went home and started to call people who I hadn't come out to and simply told them ""I'm gay"".  I think this is an indication that this is one powerful movie.  After the film festival, the film came back to Rochester and I made it a personal mission to drag all my friends to see this film.  I lost track how many times I saw it in the theater.  And now, Edge of 17 has become the second film of my new DVD collection.

1356280,5,B00004UEDZ,"Yes... it's another ""coming out"" movie. Luckily, this one stands out from the crowd -- thanks to great performances and an honest and sensitive portrayal.
It's 1984 in Sandusky, Ohio... 17-year-old Eric (Stafford) finishes his junior year at high school and takes a summer job serving food at the local amusement park, along with his best friend Maggie (Holmes). There he meets openly gay Rod (Gabrych), who sets Eric off on his road to realizing his budding homosexuality.
The movie does an excellent job of showing the truthful highs & lows of coming out in your teens. In Eric's discovery, he has his first and several gay sexual experiences (and mistakes that sex for love), goes to his first gay bar, silently deals with the ""queer"" name calling by his classmates, hides his sexuality from his family, & sleeps with and then alienates his best female friend... all while morphing from a ""nerd"" into an eccentric dressing, hair-dyed 80's new wave child in his attempt to become individual. The results are honest, funny, heartfelt, and displayed with an unexpected sexual candor.
The cast is absolutely fantastic. The real stand-out is Chris Stafford, who plays Eric as a sweetly naive young man without becoming sappy. Tina Holmes is great as Maggie, giving a wonderful performance of someone torn between love and then hate. Stephanie McVay plays Eric's sweet & headstrong Mom, and gives her character emotional depth (especially when Eric finally admits his homosexuality). Best of all, Lea Delaria is an absolute treat as the summer job boss and local gay bar owner that turns into the friend & tour guide we all wish we had when coming out.
Accompanied by a terrific soundtrack featuring Bronski Beat, the Eurythmics, and the Thompson Twins (for all you Twins' lovers, frontman Tom Bailey composed the score!), this movie wins on all points. I think you'll greatly enjoy it and ask for a repeat viewing... especially if your life often mirrored it, like some anonymous reviewer.",1001203200,49,1987,4.9879518072289155

Everyone's name was changed except mine as it possesses an angelic, divine intervention quality for my ""little man"" who I took under my intervening wing that summer. I was the older college mentor to the younger high school student, as there were no gay/lesbian support groups for high school people back in those days.  Trust me, I know & had to find out my own heartbreakingly way...so when meeting ""Eric"", his special-ness & hetero-line crossing angst touched my heart as does this movie he wrote.  Those were the best years of my life when everything for me was perfect and I was glad for the bond I began and still have with ""Eric"".  I had the lifestyle, a lover, great gay/lesbian/bi/straight friends, a fun summer job in an amusement park on Lake Erie, a great sense of humor, a fun gay club to party at in a time period of terrific music when androgeny was hip and very hot. This is a great movie with a great soundtrack because it really happened and I was a part of it.  It's a pretty neat thing to have one's life and times on film; to have been included in on it's creation; to have been portrayed by a well-known and dynamic actress & comedienne & to be a part of the gay & lesbian movement.

1356284,5,B00004UEDZ,"""Edge of Seventeen"" is an engaging debut .  The story of a young man who struggles to find acceptance of his own sexuality through experience and discovery.  Set in the 80's, Chris Stafford's debut is gentle, endearing, and wonderfully precise.  The movie can be all too familiar in remembering those times of innocents, and how difficult it is to come out to friends and family.  This is a very promising debut for Stafford and for the rest of the cast.  Absolutely Fabulous!!!",992822400,5,478,4.780487804878049

1356286,4,B00004UEDZ,"Perhaps the most intriguing moments in ""Edge of Seventeen"" involve those at an all-night gay bar, where the main character ventures in order to live his lifestyle out in the open, away from all his cumbersome worries of being closeted at home and school. He just dances and laughs the night away, the flashing red and blue lights casting shadows and colors across the floor, symbolizing the ever-difficult journey into the world of open homosexuality.
""Edge of Seventeen"" is dynamic in the way in which it unfolds, bringing its story to light in so many new and fresh ways. While all of the characters unfold in their own way, the most evolving and moving character is Eric, whose journey down the path of coming out and discovery of his sexual and physical identity set the stage for a heartfelt human drama that will keep you involved throughout. I found myself reminiscing to the times in Eric's life that I, too, lived through, as well as laughing hysterically along with him as he enjoyed his life the only way he knew how. More importantly, I came to realize just how true this movie is, not so much in how Eric lived his life, but his feelings and emotions, and how he deals with them in the course of coming out.
As the summer of his junior year begins, Eric has high hopes for his summer. He, along with his best friend Maggie, are both beginning a job at the local fairground restaurant. The job seems rather listless, until Eric meets Rod, the blond hottie who also works at the restaurant, and who makes it no secret that he is gay. At first, Eric seems uncomfortable, yet he warms to Rod's jokes and advances, ultimately leading to a night of passion between the two the last night of their working together. This all goes on within the first half hour, and while it seems a little overwhelming for such a short period of running time, it all makes sense because Eric's experiences are meant to be just that. The rush that he gets from the pace of events will affect him much later into the film.
Going back to school provides for nothing but hour upon hour of daydreaming of Rod, which leads Eric to explore his sexuality a little more openly, but only when he begins frequenting an all-night gay bar. One night, after fooling around with a guy in his car, Eric calls Rod, asking him what it all means, and professing what might be the makings of love, only to be shot down by Rod when he confesses that he has gotten back together with his ex. This begins a very devastating journey for Eric, who explores both his attraction for men and for his best friend, Maggie, and learns that he is only lying to himself by denying his same-sex attractions.
The film is one for the ages, and it proves this by taking a story that could be placed in any recent time period and placing it in the 80's. The film is truly brilliant in bringing to life the music, the clothing styles, the lifestyles, and every other nuance of this era. The movie is able to achieve its goal in making us feel transported back to that time period, and it also makes itself look like it comes from that time period as well. This only makes it all the more special.
The film also creates a well-crafted balance of humor and tension, both sexual and emotional, for Eric. When he first meets Rod, he knows he is attracted to him, and the big question that rises among the audience is, ""Will they have sex?"" After they do, the next big question comes, and that is whether or not this is going to be a Cinderella ending, where Rod sweeps Eric off his feet and stays with him forever. Unfortunately, or fortunately, however you take it, the rest of the film has much more in store for Eric, and instead of giving him nothing but daydreaming to do for the rest of the running time, he is given a chance to explore more deeply his desires, his fears, and who he knows he is inside.
There is only one turnoff for me in this film, and that is some of the strings lefts untied in the end. I advise you to read no further if you have not seen this movie, but if you have, please continue. After Eric comes out to his mother, she leaves the room, but not before hugging him and asking ""What did I do wrong?"" We never see the two discuss the events of the last year, nor do they ever come to an understanding of one another's feelings about his sexuality, which is a bit of a letdown. Also, Eric and Maggie end up sleeping together, and soon he realizes that he cannot be with her no matter how much he may say he loves her because he cannot deny his attraction to men. She leaves, and they do not speak for the rest of the movie. Do they ever talk to or see each other again? We may never know, unless a sequel is in the works.
There is such a terrific amount of acting for this film, and that is what keeps it moving: powerful performances by some of the best actors ever in a movie of this genre. Chris Stafford gives a stunningly powerful performance as Eric Hunter, playing out all of his emotions with believable feeling while never coming off as forced. His acting job tells us as an audience that he is aware of his status in this movie, and is determined to do a good job, with successful results. Andersen Gabrych plays Rod, the blond hottie of Eric's dreams, and while his emotional outwardness for the film is not as important, he still makes his character real. Tina Holmes is striking as Eric's best friend, Maggie, and when it comes time for her performance to really deliver, she does her utmost best in giving us heart and emotion. The comical relief of the film is given us by Lea DeLaria, who plays the group's boss at the restaurant and also becomes a mentor of sorts for Eric. She spans both horizons, playing the clown while also adding wisdom and wit to her words.
""Edge of Seventeen,"" while being an independent film, has the look and feel of an afterschool special for Showtime or HBO, but it plays itself to be so much more than that. It takes itself very seriously when it needs to, not bogging us down with too much emotion at once, but giving us just enough to make us realize that the story is one that happens to everyday people. Performances add a lot to the heart of the story, if not giving us some eye candy to look at. It will keep you entertained as well as bring back memories for those of us who can relate to Eric and his struggle for his true identity.",984873600,8,6361,4.3597304128053915

1356288,5,B00004UEDZ,"""Edge of Seventeen"" is for all of us who grew up gay in the 80's.  This movie hits the bull's eye when it comes to capturing the nuances of the summer of 1984.  If you remember listening to Eurythmics and the Thompson Twins and the whole ""Second British Invasion,"" then you will relate to Eric and the soundtrack to his adolescence.  The songs selected here evoke the emotions that Eric is going through: excitement, naivete, and a hint of melancholy underneath.  It's surprising that this movie was made in 1999... you'd almost think it was filmed in the summer of 1984.
Eric's journey out of the closet is a sweet and unapologetic one.  Granted, the plot of the hip older guy leading the ingenue into his first taste of love and loss is not new, but the actor who portrays Eric gives a performance so honest that it's hard to believe he is acting.  This is someone with good eye for detail... from his Tom Bailey haircut to the lost look in his eyes when Rod disillusions him... he really gets it right.  And the scene where he comes out of the closet to his mother and pleads with her (""Look at me.  Look at me."") is heart-melting.",980553600,18,1134,4.418269230769231

Every character in this movie reminded me of someone stuck in Largo, Florida during the 80's just like me.  If you were into Culture Club, Eurythmics, Heaven 17, the Cure, Cocteau Twins, gay bars, teen clubs, the drive-in, cloves, rush, thrift clothes, trench coats, your grandmothers costume jewelry and swatches, then you will appreciate this film!!!",976665600,9,624,4.75
1356290,4,B00004UEDZ,"Finally somebody has a made film about what it was to be gay in the 80s.  This is the film John Hughes should have made right after Pretty in Pink.  And for all intents and purposes, this is what this film is: a gay John Hughes film.  Okay, somebody else had to make it for him fifteen years later, but we can let that pass. :-)
I'm an 80s fan so I know my 80s music, I know 80s haircuts, and I know 80s clothes.  Guess what: they got it all right in this film.  Aesthetically and musically, this was an entirely perfect film.  You'd have to push someone's nose into the fine print on the jewelcase to prove it wasn't made in the 80s.
Another thing I appreciate about this film is its subtle interplay between two subcultures during this era -- gay culture as well as New Wave culture.  The music here isn't what the Top 40 stations were playing then, and the clothes the main character wears are not what everybody was donning at high school.  The main character is attracted to New Wave culture and style as a means to express his identity as a gay male.  In doing so, he in effect becomes a double minority.  People begin to shun him not only for his sexuality but for his appearance and tastes.  This synthesis of subcultures is what spoke to me most about this film.  I wonder if anybody will ever approach it again.
I gave this film four stars instead of five due to the lacking acting ability on the part of the college guy.  It was really dreadful.  In fact, none of the acting was strong here, but at the same time, keep in mind this is meant to be an predominantly upbeat film so this does not ruin the experience by any means.  They're seeking to create a faux John Hughes film.  Enough said.
We know this plot already, and have heard it over and over again.  But Edge creates a space for itself by exploring the same question in the 1980s, when coming out really was the proverbial ""big deal.""  And by using the cultural landscape of the 1980s as the backdrop for the tale, it tells other stories as well.

1356293,5,B00004UEDZ,"Released nationwide in 1999 after an initial, limited run in 1998, ""Edge of Seventeen"" is a beautiful, haunting, and thought-provoking film that speaks eloquently to all of us - no matter what gender and/or sexual orientation we may be.  Hard-core denizens of the Religious Right won't enjoy this lovely film.  As did ""It's In the Water"" a year earlier, ""Edge"" boasts a bevy of intriguing, sympathetic characters.  The film's two standout performances are Chris Stafford's deft and sensitive portrayal of Eric, a 17-year-old high school student who struggles to come to terms with his sexual orientation in 1980s' Sandusky, Ohio - and Lea DeLaria's presentation of Angie, Eric's mentor and boss.  DeLaria is bawdy, beautiful, witty, and bodacious.  Her skillful performance adds a grateful mixture of humor and compassion, and it is a perfect complement to Stafford's sweetly textured Eric. Also deserving of honorable mention is Andersen Gabrych's excellent portrayal of Rod, a callous, opportunistic, inordinately handsome user who brings out the vulnerable and trusting Eric - and coldly leaves him to deal with the attendant emotional wreckage.  Like ""It's In The Water"" before it, ""Edge"" struck a chord with this reviewer (and reformed homophobe) because it powerfully reinforced an enduring reality that I had already begun to embrace:  all of us are connected by the joys and vicissitudes of life (and our own humanity), no matter if we are straight or gay.  Moreover, we have a duty to be true to ourselves (something Stafford himself declared in ""The Advocate"" magazine in 1999).  Finally, the events in ""Edge"" resonated deeply with this reviewer - in many ways, the film was a soundtrack of my own adolescence.  Don't view this DVD if you're one of the Rev. Fred Phelps' disciples, though.  One of the scenes caused me to bury my head in my lap for about 10 seconds (let's just say this depiction wasn't something I ever read about in ""Clean Love and Courtship:  A Guide for Young Catholic Women"").  But it's doubtful that my dedication to this transcendent film will equate to 70 years of bad luck.  ""Edge of Seventeen"" is David Moreton's heartfelt and inspiring cinematic jewel.

1356297,3,B00004UEDZ,"EDGE OF SEVENTEEN

(USA - 1998)

Aspect ratio: 1.85:1
Theatrical soundtrack: Dolby Stereo SR

The age-old dilemma of gay teens and the reactions of their friends and families is given another (welcome) work-out in David Moreton's refreshingly candid EDGE OF SEVENTEEN, a painfully  accurate portrayal of a young guy stumbling awkwardly out of the closet and realising that the so-called 'limitless' possibilities of youth aren't so limitless after all.

Though the theme is familiar, ""Edge"" is distinguished by its no-frills direction, heartfelt script and, especially, an astonishingly accomplished performance by Chris Stafford. He plays Eric, a 17 year old high school student in Ohio, circa 1984, who can't begin to lay the foundations of his adult life until he's come to terms with his emerging sexuality. Intrigued by an openly gay workmate (Andersen Gabrych) at the diner where they both work after school, Eric finally plucks up the courage to explore his true self, guided by the diner's matriarchal lesbian owner (Lea DeLaria, playing substitute mother to a predominantly young  cast), only to discover that people aren't always what they seem.

For such a young actor, Stafford is breathtakingly good as the teenager both excited and terrified by the strange directions in which his life is pulling him. Todd Stephens' script captures the highs and lows of first love and rejection, and Stafford plays it with just the right amount of charm and naivety. Perhaps director Moreton could have beefed up some of the dramatic fireworks which dominate the second half of the picture, (SPOILER ALERT) notably Eric's confession to a close female friend (Tina  Holmes) who secretly loves him and is crushed by his revelation, and the  heartbreaking moment when Eric finally comes out to his mother (Stephanie  McVay) (END OF SPOILER), though these scenes still retain much of their impact and are extremely well-acted by all concerned.

Some viewers have complained that the movie ends too abruptly, with many of Eric's problems unresolved. But if the film has any message at all, it's that few people reach the end of the rainbow, and sometimes it can take a lifetime to resolve the worst of our difficulties, if at all. The story ends with Eric at an emotional crossroads, which is the only place where such an honest film could possibly conclude.",966902400,15,2352,5.114882506527415
