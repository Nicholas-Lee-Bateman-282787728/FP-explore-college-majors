6656699,4,B00NH89D6E,"This finally gave me what I wanted, how Naurto's parents died.  It was brief, but it explained so much and I wound up crying.  Overall, the movie was good.  Naurto and Sakura find themselves in an alternate reality and their lives are changed.  Sakura experiences Naurto's life and Naurto experiences Sakura's.  It is worth watching.",1487635200,,333,4.9818181818181815
6656700,5,B00NH89D6E,I loved this movie!!! It had action comedy and a good look on what other people go through and to be thankful for what you have. And just because your parents might make you mad or stuff like that. and you wish something was different it could be worse then you had to begin with. And the ending will trough you for a twist. And to see all the akatski fighting was well worth it. I loved watching itachi lol. And hinata had me rolling later in the movie.,1485648000,,454,4.112359550561798

6656704,1,B00NH89D6E,"Naruto is about a deep honor to become Hokage and bring peace to the shinobi world. The entire 30min of this movie is a total disgrace. Rock Lee was put in women panties. Sakura, Ino, and Hinata were over exposed in a hot spring..as if the show is even like that. The guys were naked showing everything but frontal nudity..this is ridiculous even if you are some hotblooded teenager without a gf! This movie plays way to much on Madara's  ocular jutsu, just for madara to leave the fighting to a Naruto doppleganger. It's a really immature movie and is the absolute worst I've ever seen Naruto. No epic battles just tons of soap opera drama. This was super disappointing.",1474416000,,671,4.591666666666667

6656706,4,B00NH89D6E,"Naruto Shippuden Road to ninja
This going to be hard not to spoiled this movie The movie was great if you noticed the characters their attitude is completely backwards it's movie at my chair there was one villain in the movie his voice was pretty bad the only reason I think they did was to surprised the viewer here my overall rating will I want to watch this movie over again maybe like 5 times but not in a row if I forgot about it I can rewatched over again next year

6656707,5,B00NH89D6E,This movie takes place in an parallel universe where Naruto's parents are both still alive and it was Sakura's parents who died protecting the village from the Nine Tailed Fox. Throughout the movie Naruto slowly begins to bond with his parents and learn more about them and how things might have been. Overall I enjoyed this movie and felt it was really entertaining and enjoyed getting to know a bit more about Naruto's parents.,1468281600,,429,4.8108108108108105

6656713,4,B00NH89D6E,The movie itself is greata and provides a lot of fun. Now my blu ray had like a black sticky thing on the sleeve.  I was pretty mad because i bought the blu ray over the dvd for the appearance. I tried to remove the black stuff but i messed up the sleeve a little.,1451692800,,264,3.8

6656719,5,B00NH89D6E,"A great movie, especially if you're a Naruto fan. Great story line, and mixed with both action, a bit of comedy, and in my opinion, mostly filled with heart felt emotions (or whatever, but it's really good). All I really have to say is that this movie, unlike the previous Naruto and Naruto Shippuden movies, brought tears out of me at the end.",1444089600,,344,4.476190476190476
6656720,5,B00NH89D6E,"As  the  first  official naruto  movie  to  be  considered  canon  to  the  manga  they  hit  it  out  of  the  park!  Seeing  Kishimoto's artwork  done  by the  creater  himself  is  just  awesome  and  you  can  immediately  tell  the  difference  between  this  movies artwork  and  the  artwork of previous  films. You  immediatelly feel  the  hand  of  the  creater which  to  me  gave  the  movie  a  different  feel  then  other  entries in  the  film franchise.  This  also  the  most  somber  and  dramatic  storyline  that  i  have  seen  from  the  series  since the Naruto/Sasuke dual  in  the  original Manga series (  I  haven't  read  the  manga  in  five  so  i'm  just  comparing my  experience  with  the  series.)  I  can't  wait  for  the next weeks  release of ""The Last: Naruto The Movie""  i  am  especially  psyched  for the U.S. release of ""Boruto: Naruto the movie""  its  an  exciting time  to  be  a Naruto fan. SEE IT! (if you are a fan.)",1443571200,,965,4.480769230769231
6656721,4,B00NH89D6E,Now this was an interesting movie. I won't give a way the story. Lets just say you might see it coming but it still surprise you.,1443398400,,129,4.0
6656722,5,B00NH89D6E,"This idea and script for this movie was headed by Naruto manga creator Masashi Kishimoto. The story doesn't actually fit in with canonical events, but no movie except The Last is officially canon anyway.

With that information I feel this movie stands out from the rest, in that the story is very touching and gives fans of both the manga and anime a good perspective of ""what if?"" The story is even more expanded upon thanks to Road to Naruto the Movie (manga one shot) that was later adapted in to the anime episode #311 Prologue of Road to Ninja. Also anime episode #271 Road to Sakura is a fun tie-in as well. I recommend watching episode #311, then the movie, followed by episode #271.

The culmination of all the above makes this a splendid movie and is well worth the time and money for new fans or die-hard.",1442534400,,815,4.4630872483221475
6656723,4,B00NH89D6E,"The movie was good it had it's moments but, to bad it didn't make any sense with the actual Naruto story line. It's still a good movie if you watch it you have to watch it as a movie don't try to connect it to the actual story line.",1442188800,,232,3.7551020408163267

6656752,5,B00NH89D6E,"Great film. Excellent all the way through. I own over 700 anime DVDs, ranging from OVA's to full series. I have always been a fan of Naruto even though its gone through it stale stages during its conclusion, however, going back and watching the films really brings back how great Naruto has been leading up to. A very unique story with a fairly predictable outcome (if you've kept up with the series/fillers) however, it may be a bit of a brain twister if you haven't did your home work.

And although it is a bit dull in plot, the execution is superb. Definitely worth your attention if your a Naruto fan.",1425254400,,265,4.541666666666667
6656756,4,B00NH89D6E,It's a fairly decent movie and fully surprising on how everyone is reversed. It also opens the view to Naruto's dream of having parents.,1424908800,,136,4.708333333333333

6656759,5,B00NH89D6E,A fantastic movie due to the elements of an alternate world. One in which narutos parents don't die and the naruto from the original world gets to see them but what of the naruto from the alternate world?where is he?.. A damn good movie that shows what could'he happened if the nine tails didn't kill minato or kushina.. It was a sad movie if you'be been watching naruto for a good while then you'll feel for naruto.,1423785600,,416,4.415584415584416

6656769,5,B00NH89D6E,"Just  finished watching ""Road To Ninja - Naruto The Movie"" released by VIZ Media.
Naruto is one of my favorite anime characters.  He embodies the  true warrior spirit of never giving up and standing up for what you believe in.
In ""Road To Ninja,"" Naruto is tapped in a parallel universe by an enemy who is out to destroy the Hidden Leaf Village - the very same shinobi who killed his parents.  Aleady disheartened by feeling alone from a lack of family, Naruto discovers that in this universe, his parents are still alive; and so is the parallel version of himself - a very twisted version of himself.
Sakura is also trapped with Naruto in this alternate reality and she esperiences what life has been like for Naruto. It's rather an eye  opening experience for her.
While enticed by the false promises of this alternate universe, Naruto never forgets himself nor his true parents and friends; and defeats not only his evil alternative self, whith the help of the Nine-Tailed Fox, but also the shonibi who sent him there.
STRONGLY RECOMMEDED!

This one was an amazing movie. It had so much laughs in it. Shikamaru made me feel weird with his changed personality since he's one of my favorite characters. Same with Chouji. Overall, this is probably one of the best Shippuden movies I've seen along with ""Blood Prison"". If you're a big fan of Naruto, I highly recommend watching this movie.",1418774400,,496,4.712643678160919

6656782,5,B00NH89D6E,In this movie Naruto & Sakura are transported to an alternate reality created by Tobi. In this reality everyone they new is basically opposit & Naruto's parents are still alive. At the end both Naruto & Sakura have to fight their way out of this world with the help of some unlikely allies. This movie I thought was interesting despite a few boring moments.,1418083200,4,357,4.59375
6656783,3,B00NH89D6E,"Don't know why, but this movie just didn't seem as good as the others.  Maybe because they just rehashed stories that were already told.  It felt more like a fan service movie than a meaningful plot.

It would also be nice for once to have a movie where naruto actually made use of the power and abilities he has gained in the series rather than totally sucking until the big power boost 5 minutes before the end.",1417910400,,413,4.337662337662338
6656784,5,B00NH89D6E,"Just finished watching ""Road to Ninja.""  I have one word that describes my experience.  And that word is - Superb.  To get the most out of watching ""Naruto Shippuden Road to Ninja: The Movie 6 [Blu-ray],"" I highly recommend 'first' watching the entire Naruto english dubbed episode series in numerical order starting with Naruto: Original & Uncut / Box Set 1 / Episode 1.  Stay true to yourself and do not deviate.  There is a big surprise when you get to Naruto: Shippuden - Original & Uncut.  Only those who stay the coarse, without jumping ahead, will discover the surprise.  So far, I've seen them all, through to episode 257 [DVD Box Set 20] in order of their release and numerical episode progression.  An experience that gives me first-hand experience when making such a recommendation.  The next Uncut Edition English Dubbed Box Set is due to be released January 20, 2015.  Box Set 21 will contain episodes 258-270.  So far there are 389 episodes that have already been released in the original Japanese language.  Being apart of the Naruto fan base, I am proud to say that it has been an educational adventure / journey on so many levels.  The Naruto Movies should also be viewed in order of their release date, in conjunction with the Uncut Edition English Dubbed Box Set releases, to get maximum pleasure from the Naruto [Shippuden] journey / adventure.  So far, every english dubbed Naruto movie, in order of US release date, are as follows: 1) Naruto: the Lost Story - Mission: Protect the Waterfall Village!  2) Naruto: The Movie - Ninja Clash in the Land of Snow  3) Naruto: The Movie - Legend of the Stone of Gelel  4) Naruto: The Movie - Guardians of the Crescent Moon Kingdom  5) Naruto : The Movie - Shippuden  6) Naruto: The Movie - Shippuden / Bonds  7) Naruto: The Movie - Shippuden / The Will of Fire  8) Naruto: The Movie - Shippuden / The Lost Tower  9) Naruto: The Movie - Shippuden / Blood Prison  10) Road To Ninja: Naruto The Movie.  And as young Naruto Uzumaki would say, ""Believe it!""",1417564800,10,2015,4.595505617977528
6656785,5,B00NH89D6E,I love Naruto and this was a movie that I have been waiting to see in the USA for really long time as soon as I had the money I got it,1417478400,2,134,3.21875

6656787,5,B00NH89D6E,"So what makes this movie stand out than the others? The story! Full of heart and good messages is one way to describe this movie. You get to see what the Naruto series is all about and thats friendship, family, Loyalties and self respect!
This is a ""what if"" scenario when The ""Masked Man"" suddenly appears before Naruto and Sakura and by using what he calls an experimental Jutsu he transform both Naruto and Sakura to another dimension where everything and everyone is the complete opposite of what they know. Now Naruto and Sakura have to find a way to return back to there own world and face the The ""Masked Man"" responsible not only for everything he did but also for things he did in the past. It won't be an easy task because in this world Naruto's parents are alive and well but Sakuras are not!
 For me this movie had everything! Comedy, Great action scenes, unexpected characters returning and most of all a great story line full of heart! Highly recommended for all Naruto fans out there!!!",1417305600,5,1001,4.561111111111111

6656791,5,B00NH89D6E,"A Naruto movie that I actually want to own a copy... Every other movie has its own filler story... this has too but... it's just... different from the other ones... You get to see the ""what if..."" from the original story... like what would Naruto be like if his parents didn't die that day? What his life could have been and all... it's painful as you watch all that happened in the movie with the knowledge in mine that it's not the way it is right now... It's just sad but a really good movie... :)",1416960000,12,500,4.21875
