1793847,5,B00006SFK7,"Fruits Basket is an anime series full of laughs, as well as a darker side full of emotional anxiety and termoil.
The story is about a girl, Tohru, who loses her mother in a car accident and ends up living in a tent in order to avoid being a nuissance to her friends and family. She is discouvered by Yuki and Shigure, members of the Sohma family who invite her to live with them in their house. She soon discouvers that there is a curse on them though, which makes them turn into an animal of the zodiac if they are 'huggled' by a member of the opposite sex. This causes many adventures as Tohru slowly begins to meet more members of the Sohma family, and as she tries to understand them and their emotional anxiety and pains as she tries to make everyone happy.
This is truly an exceptional story which is bound to make you cry at some point. This first dvd contains the first 6 episodes of the series (of a total of 26 episodes), and so it should be worth buying!",1034121600,,965,4.221621621621622
1793848,5,B00006SFK7,"Fruits Basket is an anime for everybody who loves anime. Focusing on an old legend based on the animals of the Chinese Zodiac, Tohru is a girl whose mother has recently died and now lives her life in a tent not far from the Sohma family house. One day the Sohmas discover Tohru is living there and decide to invite her to live their home, which is currently inhabited by Shigure Sohma (a writer) and Yuki Sohma (one of Tohru's popular classmates at school).
Feeling completely indebted to the Sohma family, Tohru begins her life at their house cooking and cleaning and getting to know Yuki, who she develops feelings for. Soon enough another Sohma family member shows up. He is the hot-headed Kyou Sohma, who is ALWAYS ""playing the game of cat and mouse"" with Yuki. Quite literally.
So what's the catch? The Sohma family are the reincarnated members of the 'Juunishi' , or 12 Zodiac animals, and when they hug a member of the opposite sex, they turn into their innate Zodiac animal. Imagine Tohru's surprise when she accidentally finds this out! Up until now, no non-members of the Juunishi have been allowed know about the secret without having their memories erased, but Tohru's warm heart and kindness cause her to become the first exception to this rule.
Together Tohru and the Sohma family go through lots of adventures and ordeals that are bound to make any viewer laugh and cry and want to tell their neighbor all about this crazy new show that they've discovered. As soon as I started watching this series, I couldn't get enough of it, and you probably aren't going to be able to either!",1034035200,5,1595,4.659574468085107

1793874,4,B00006SFK7,"Imagine if you moved in with a new family and friends... and found out they turn into animals when you hug them.

That's the odd situation in the first volume of ""Fruits Basket,"" the adaptation of Natsuki Takaya's hit manga. And this anime adapes the material very nicely -- quirky characters, slapsticky action, and a lovably sunshiney heroine who helps her cursed friends, despite her own unhappy past.

As the story opens, Tohru Honda is living in the woods in a cheap tent, with only her late mother's photo for company. One day she wanders down to a large house nearby, and encounters the flirtatious Shigure Sohma, and his gorgeous cousin Yuki -- the school's mysterious ""Prince."" After Tohru becomes ill and her tent is destroyed, Yuki and Shigure take her into their home as their new housekeeper.

But Yuki and Shigure are keeping a secret from her. When martial-artist Kyo bursts in to fight Yuki, Tohru tries to stop him -- and the three men end up turning into a dog, a cat, and a rat. Their family is cursed with the thirteen spirits of the Chinese zodiac, and they turn into those animals whenever a member of the opposite sex hugs them.

Surprisingly, the mysterious family head Akito allows Tohru to stay with Yuki and Shigure, as long as the volatile Kyo also stays. And soon she starts encountering new problems -- the intermittently crazed Kagura (the boar) invades the house, Yuki and Kyo trash the house, and Tohru's pals Hana and Uo come for a sleepover. But when Tohru's grandfather calls her back to his house, will the Sohmas lose their new friend?

The first volume of the ""Fruits Basket"" anime is somewhat weak compared to what comes after it -- the first three episodes are devoted almost exclusively to introducing the main four characters, and setting up the whole idea of the zodiac curse. It just takes the story awhile to get going.

And when it does get going, it's genuinely charming -- there's lots of romantic tension, slapstick fight scenes (Kagura twirling Kyo's body like a lasso), and amusingly tongue-in-cheek dialogue (""Since when do we have a rice cooker?"" ""I found it in the trash!""). But there's also a melancholy side to the story, such as Tohru's tragic past and the Sohmas' inability to interact normally with other people.

Tohru herself is the most lovable character of the bunch -- she has a lot of sorrow over her mother's death and the unkindness of some of her relatives, but she compensates with optimism and friendliness. And the Sohmas rule as far as quirkiness is concerned -- there's the shy, strong ""Prince"" Yuki, the volatile loner Kyo, and the charmingly kooky Shigure (""Sometimes it feels like the whole world is conspiring to destroy my house!"").

It's graced with some solid animation, and an excellent English dub. I should explain that in this case, the Japanese dub isn't quite as good: while most of the voice actors in either language are great, the Japanese ""Yuki"" voice is... a girl. I don't know why they did that, but they did. The English voice actor is definitely better for the role -- smooth, deep and gentle.

The first volume of ""Fruits Basket"" starts slowly, but once the storyline gets its footings, it's a quirky, sweet-natured little comedy with lots of lovable characters. Delightful all the way.",1189382400,,3282,4.774250440917108

1793876,4,B00006SFK7,"When I got this, I was a bit wary of bad dubbing- but as it turns out- the DVD's almost follow the manga's exactly! That pleased me to no extent, because a lot of dubs tend to ruin good animes.

The animation, I think, is quite nice, simple shading and such but enjoyable.

Overall, this is a great seris with an excellent plot. The end may leave you hanging, so purchase the next volumes of manga. ;D",1135814400,4,401,4.194805194805195
1793877,5,B00006SFK7,"Tohru Honda is a cute, bubbly orphaned high school sophomore who lost her mother in May, and is secretly living in a tent in the woods.  She pays for her own tuition via her janitorial job.  She's got it rough, but she feels blessed to have two friends, tough talking blonde Arisa Uotani and the goth-like Saki Hanajima, with a soft but low menacing voice who threatens to zap anyone bullying Tohru with harmful vibes.  But as she says, ""one of my virtues is that no matter the times, I will not be discouraged.""

Meet the Sohmas.  Tohru does and discovers to her amazement that they are a family cursed with the spirits of the twelve animals of the Chinese zodiac.  Whenever their bodies weaken or they are hugged by a member of the opposite sex, they turn into their totem animal.  Shigure turns into a dog, Yuki into a rat, and Kyo into a cat.  She then becomes greater friends with Yuki, the handsome and androgynous popular ""prince"" of Tohru's high school.  In exchange for keeping their secret, Tohru gets free rent and cooks and cleans for them. The Sohmas become like a new family to her, as she finds somewhere she belongs, bringing to mind the game Fruits Basket, where each child was given the name of a fruit, and when their name was called, they'd join in the center.  Tohru was given the name ""onigiri"" or riceball, as a cruel joke, and hence she was excluded.

According to legend, the zodiac animals were invited to a banquet by god, but the mischievous rat told the cat the banquet was the day after.  The cat missed the banquet and was thus excluded from the zodiac.  Thus the cat and rat are at odds against each other, and a large piece of the story involves the short-tempered and embittered Kyo threatening to physically beat Yuki, to become a formal member of the zodiac, but alas, Yuki amazingly kicks Kyo's a** repeatedly, as well as bickering.  As an injoke, Saki and Arisa says the pair's arguing reminds them of that cartoon, ""something and Jerry.""

Kyo, though, feels he isn't cut out for socializing, but Shigure tells him that ""unless you interact with people, hurting them and being hurt by them as you learn about them as well as yourself, you'll never be the kind of person who can be concerned about others.""  But Tohru, who wept as a child upon hearing the cat's fate, is someone who loves the cat and despite Kyo's temper, some of it aimed at her, realizes that Kyo is someone ""who is a little more awkward than others, but a good person deep down, a gentle person who knows when he feels sorry.""

Both Yuki and Kyo are socially awkward with people, and popular.  Whereas Yuki feels inferior because of his shyness, Kyo doesn't react well to people he doesn't know, but once they get to know him, he tends to attract people like a magnet.  Yuki says that he's nice because he wants to be liked by others, but that makes him hypocritical.

But Tohru recalls her mother saying how people weren't born with kindness, and that it's easier to doubt than to believe and better to do the latter.  ""Kindness is something that develops just as our bodies do, and the heart that grows inside is our conscience.  ...Tohru, become a girl who believes in others.  That will surely lend strength to someone.""  And she does, to both Yuki and Kyo.

Voicing Tohru has given Yui Horie her most lovable role ever.  Other veterans include Tomokazu Seki (Kyo), who's done work for Chobits (as Shimbo) and more recently, as cosplay costume designer Tanaka in Genshiken.  Pop singer Aya Hisakawa (Yuki) also voiced PE teacher Kurosawa in Azumanga Daioh and Sailor Mercury in Sailor Moon.

I was soooooooo enchanted, mainly because of Tohru, who is that rare of people, a romantic, a cooperator, ""someone who understands other people's feelings,"" and someone who wants to be friends with everyone and charms everyone she meets with her personality.  When at first it looks as if her memory might be erased to keep the Sohmas' secret, she fully understands and cheerily asks Yuki, who feels stunned and guilty, ""When my memory is erased, please be my friend again, okay?""  The revelation of her mother's death kind of stirred something in me, as my own mother also died in May.  Small wonder she is my second favourite anime character, after Aoi Sakuraba (Ai Yori Aoshi), and FB my third favourite anime series.",1128902400,4,4323,4.619109947643979
1793878,2,B00006SFK7,"Let me start out by saying that I love Fruits Basket manga, and I discovered the Anime. I of course bought it, and began watching immeadiatly. Perhaps my standerds were a bit too high, but I was severely disappointed.

They, as it turns out, are very different from the books, but also quite alike. In my own opinion, it should perhaps be different then the book so that you aren't just watching the same thing you alreasy read. However, this one followed the storyline almost exactly, but was 'cute-ified'. Instead of the strong characters and storylines I fell in love with, I was left with a confused expression on my face watching everything be 'cute'.

It really doesn't feel finished at the end, which leaves you hanging, but also not really caring enough.

I also much add- If you have not read any of the books, then you must know that the main character can be VERY annoying if you are not under age 8. In fact, I think that this is much preffered for ages 6-12. It is enjoyable for that age group, but considered quite childish for teenagers.

I am not saying you won't enjoy it if you are a teenager or up, I'm just saying it isn't very appealing for most. So if you have a kid in that age group, I believe they will enjoy them a lot, but not like the books however. But if you enjoy the depth of the books to their fullest, then you probably won't like this.

I must also warn you. If you decided to buy the DVD anyway, then I highly recommend the Japanese voices and English subtitles. It improves the quality by far. The English voices are just boring and monotone.",1128556800,4,1579,4.375426621160409

This series is my exception to that rule.  The plot is not always cheery; as you delve into the pasts of the characters,you almost always find heartache.  But in spite of that, I always find myself smiling by the end of every show.  The story moves along smoothly, almost predictably, but I rarely find myself bored.

1793894,5,B00006SFK7,"I am a beginner to anime, this was the second ever anime I have watched, and it blew me away! This DVD is definatly for the romantic and comedy lover, watching this anime really leaves you feeling all fuzzy inside. Don't get me wrong, this anime should appeal to boys as well! It is very funny and there are little bits of humourus violence too.

The first episode might turn you off, it is a bit over the top and seems a little strange (maybe I wasn't used to anime though) but don't be discouraged, the second one really got me started on the series and I almost cried when I finished the DVD. You get really attached to all the characters and want the best for them all. The special features are really amazing, there is a behind the scenes featurette and character profile, plus textless songs. I realy liked the dub for this anime, I was getting annoyed with Yuki's voice so I tried it in Japanese, and boy was I shocked to find out that his voice was played by a girl, truely a horrible choice! Othere than that, that dubs were really well chosen. And you really get a good offer, 6 episodes on one DVD!

If you are new (or experianced) to anime then you are making the right choice, this anime is beautiful even from its opening song. A great choice!",1091836800,2,1257,4.29957805907173
1793895,5,B00006SFK7,"First off the story, about the young and helpful Tohru Honda becoming the house keeper of the Soma family, a family who are cursed to turn into an animal of the Chinese zodiac if hugged by the opposite sex, is both funny and touching.  The characters are all well developed and the background is very detailed.  The interaction can be a tad wild at times, but what's anime without some combat and silly faces?
We learn a lot about all the characters in the six episodes on this DVD.  SIX episodes, over two hours, 123 minutes!  Now include the extras, like character profiles, textless songs, a behind the scenes featurette, and you have a wonderful story at a wonderful value.  The songs are also something to listen to, perfect for this series.",1089158400,2,746,4.621212121212121
1793896,5,B00006SFK7,"Fruits Basket is quite an interesting anime, at first the show seems to over the top, and can turn off potential viewers with the giant eyes and the crazy fan club girls,  but on episode two the show really kicks off, and with the introduction of new characters, each of whom are unique and different in their own way and devolop quite a bit over the course of the series, the show becomes even funnier, as a note Fruits Basket has an amazing dub, for those who like dubs, in fact, most of the time I watch this series dubbed.
As a note I consider the Fruits Basket DVDs to be really the first truely amazingly done DVDS, at the time (Or at least to my knowledge) most Anime discs had 2-5 episodes and th only features were textless endings (Can you say crappy and boring?) but Fruits basket has not only previews for other Funimation stuff, but interviews, a documentary of the ""eye catches"" (Which are explained in the documentry) and even behind the scenes footage. AND 6 episodes per disc, and the disc has 3 regions, any fan of special features would freak out, why the only way they could get any better would be is if it came with a poster or something rather.
Overall I suguest Fruits Basket to anyone who is willing to give it a chance, the anime has elements from many genres and is a perfect balance of Comedy and Character devolopment.

1793897,5,B00006SFK7,"It all started when my friend brought over the first FB graphic novel. Well, I read it and got hooked on it, which resulted in buying the series only a week later. This anime is just the GREATEST anime I have ever seen, it's not full of lousy filler episodes, like DBZ, or pointless violence, or big mechas that fight each other, it's just an adorable little story that forces me to watch it again and again. (No lie, I'm currently on my 3 time through the series, which has made me put off watching my Roswell season 1 set and Angel season 3 set.)
I love how the members of the Zodiac in the Sohma family are portrayed like the Chinese Zodiac's description of them. For example, Haru, the cow (ox), seems so quiet, and then his temper just explodes and he goes ""black"". I just love that because I was born under the sign of the Ox, and I'm exactly the same way.
The characters are great and not horribly over-cliche. Tohru isn't one of your typical braindead ""blonde"" main females, she's very sweet, but in a way that seems real. (Although I'm not fond of hearing her speeches time and time again.) My three favorite characters are Hatori, Shigure, and Ayame. I still fall over with laughter when Ayame and Shigure make some ""naughty"" comments to each other as Torhu, Yuki, and Kyou just freak out about it. Also, Hatori, I just feel so sorry for the poor guy, he's so sweet, I just wanna hug him! ^_^
But the biggest props have to go to Funimation. Most of the English dubs you hear are just horrible and watered down compared to their Japanese counterparts. Fruits Basket is nothing like that. The majority of the script is the same, so you're not missing out on as much from the Japanese version, compared to other animes (Sailor Moon and Yu-Gi-Oh! are prime examples). Also, the English voice actors are really great too. I've always been a bigger fan of listening to Japanese voice acting than English, but FB's English cast is great, none of the characters have that whiny tone that I'm so used to hearing in other animes.
I give Fruits Basket a perfect 5. Everyone who loves anime should get it",1084147200,,2102,4.462337662337663

I had seen it when it first came out and am just writing this review now but I watch them all over and over and over and still cant get enough of them even though I know something is going to happen i still laugh at it over and over. If you have not seen or ordered Furuba yet, YOU MUST!",1082419200,,328,3.7
1793909,5,B00006SFK7,"I discovered Fruits Basket from a friend...and I cherish her beyond belief. She gave me something where I could laugh to death, cry, worry over, and sometimes feel like I could relate to. Of course, it's hard to think you could relate to anything that has to do with transforming into the cutest little animals ever... but in Fruits Basket you can.
The story starts with the aftermath of a traffic accident: the cute, understanding, COMPLETELY gold-hearted Tohru Honda's mother has passed away, and not wanting to be a burden to anyone, she stays in a tent a little away from society and works a part-time job to pay for her school tuition. Little does she know that the land on which she has pitched herself on belongs to the family of the 'prince' of her high school,Yuki Sohma.
Clever, gentle, kind, patient and polite, Yuki Sohma lives with his hilarious older cousin, Shigure (Shi-goo-ray) Sohma. Luckily for Tohru, she is invited to stay with them, on one condition: she has to do the housework and clean up 'The Sea of Corruption!' [this very-close-to-reality nickname for Shigure & Yuki's house is portrayed only in the manga; darn!]
Suddenly, after a dramatic as well as hilarious entrance, another Sohma, Kyo, has found himself smack dab in a hug...
<<<
>>>
...you're probably going 'huh? what the heck's that supposed to mean?'
<<<
>>>
*sigh* it would have been so much more fun to leave off right there, but I will show some mercy ^.~
The Sohma's are under a curse; whenever one of twelve Sohma's is hugged by a member of the opposite gender or their bodies come under a great deal of stress, they transform into one of the animals of the Chinese Zodiac.
Tohru finds herself looking straight into the eyes of an orange cat...where there should be an orange-haired boy named Kyo. She soon finds herself looking at a dog and a rat too... where Shigure and Yuki used to stand!
And in that way, Tohru Honda has discovered the big 'Sohma Family Secret.' The only thing is...what will happen next?
Akito, the head of the family (who looks exactly like a dark-haired Yuki and is way too skinny for his own good), has decided that instead of erasing Tohru's memories as he would have done, had he not decided to use her for his own maliscious reasons, Tohru is allowed to keep the family secret and live with Shigure and Yuki...and Kyo, who finds himself another resident of Shigure's house, under Akito's orders.
Although this plot sounds ever loosely woven and very predictable, believe me...it's not. The story is extremely complicated, but not so that you can't understand it, and increases at a breath-taking speed, only because you keep wanting to find out what happens next! ^_^
Now, I've mentioned very little about the absolute hilariousness of it all: I laughed until I cried, was rolling on the ground, and my sister thought I was having a heart attack or something. The characters are so well developed it almost seems possible that the author was having all the characters based on real live people...well, maybe she/he did, but what difference does that make?
Now, although my opinion should be biased since I like every anime/manga that comes my way, Fruits Basket stands out as 'The One and Absolute Best.' Understanding and trusting are key in this series, and believe me, the price is well worth it. I am not a sentimental person, and yet I cried EVERY SINGLE TIME I watched the Hatori episode and the very ending [not in this disk, sorry!]...which is equivalent to five times.
Even my mom, who doesn't like anime/manga all that much, loves this series! So really. Buy Fruits Basket. It's the absolute best. I can't praise it enough. Words are just no good. It hits all the right spots, it takes you in and then lays you back out, filled with thoughts and one of those happy, fuzzy feelings you get once you laugh your voice out.
In the famous words of me [and a couple other reviewers, i'll bet]...BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1

This is about a girl named Tohru Honda who lives in the woods caouse her parents died. Her mom died in a car accident. She go lives with some guy from school. Im not sure if this is number1 yet but it looks like it could be. There are 6uncut epsidoes on this disk.,1077926400,,391,3.9
1793911,5,B00006SFK7,"I've just rented this series from a local video store, I was expecting to see an average anime series with lots of not so original gimmicks. I was suprised however when I found out how original this series really is! I was addicted to this great series after watching about 5 minutes, its hillarious and you'll probably find yourself rolling around laughing. My friend & I laughed through the whole six episodes on disc one. The series is so cute and Prince Yuki & Kiyu (sp) are so hott!!
Summary~ Tohru lives in a forest under the shelter of only a tent after her mother death. She refuses to be any kind of a  burden to her grandfather or freinds by asking for a place to stay inside their home. One day while walking to school Tohru runs into Yuki (a classmate) who invites her to stay at his & his older brothers home.  Their shocked to find how much Tohru has suffered these last few months after her mothers death.
The problem is that Yuki, Yuki's brother, and Kiyu (Yuki's quick tempered cousin) all carry a family curse of being able to transform into their animal zodiac. (Year of the Dog... the Cat) Tohru discovers this curse when she accidently hugs Kiyu & he turns into a cat. They turn into their zodiac when hugged by the opposite sex or by their own will. So now the question stands whether Tohru can be trusted to live in their house as a house maid? Will she be able to not spill their family secret? Will they have to erase her memory? Does Yuki or Kiyu like Tohru more then a friend? ~Summary
I would suggest this series to both girls & guys since the series doesnt seem to be more of a girl series then a guys. Also I think this series is a good series in the since that a wide variety of people w/ all very different interests in anime series could fall in love with Fruits Basket.

1793912,5,B00006SFK7,"This series is a sweet, tender, introspective story.  While each episode can probably be watched individually, they all build gradually toward the dark and suspenseful ending.  I have laughed and cried watching Fruits Basket, watched the entire series through about six times, and still enjoy it.  There is not a lot of action, but there's lots of verbal comedy and plot development.

This particular video serves as an introduction to the characters.  Tohru Honda is a girl orphaned recently by the death of her mother.  She is also temporarily homeless, as her grandfather's house is being renovated.  After attempting to live in a tent, so as not to be a burden to anyone, she is taken in by the Sohma family as a live-in housekeeper.  Soon she discovers the Sohma family curse. (They transform into animals when stressed-out or hugged)  Gradually, over the first four episodes, she gets to know the denizens of Shigure's house, the popular, reserved Yuki, the hostile extrovert Kyo, and the relentless tease (but the closest thing to a responsible adult) Shigure.  Tohru herself, not the brightest bulb in the drawer, but hardworking, kind, and always striving to understand people, soon endears herself to the Sohmas, and begins to help them heal from the emotional wounds their curse--and their somewhat nasty family--have inflicted.  In the fifth episode, when Tohru is able to move out, they all finally realize what they have begin to mean to one another.  (First tear-jerker episode, but hardly the last.) In Episode 6, Tohru brings her friends to meet the Sohmas, resulting in a rather slapstick episode of accidental transformation and coverup.

The series only goes on to get better after this: it doesn't fall into any predictable pattern of slapstick or compete-for-the-girl romance.",1074729600,11,1798,5.116438356164384
1793913,5,B00006SFK7,"Fruits Basket, to put it bluntly, is GREAT.  The series is about a girl named Tohru Honda who ends up living with a family called the Sohmas after her mother dies.  Tohru uses her caring attitude to help the family cope with their past scars, as well as deal with their ""secret.""  A simple enough core plot, but it manages to incredibly hit the spectrum of emotions, from laugh-out-loud moments to tear-jerking emotional sequences, and almost all of the characters are quite lovable.  The series instantly became my favorite, which is a title that is pretty hard to get, and has not let me down at all yet.  To top things off, the DVDs have big episode counts, and piles of extra features, which are usually exclusive to the Japanese releases.  I definately reccomend that anyone who likes or is interested in trying anime give this series a shot.  Who knows, it may become your new favorite, too.  ^_^",1073001600,,902,4.628930817610063
1793914,4,B00006SFK7,"A little bit about Fruits basket: Did you know that the creator was from CLAMP Cluster? Who's that you ask? CLAMP Cluster was a doujishi circle of 11 women. When they slpit up, 4 of them stayed togeather & formed CLAMP. Perhaps you can see Appapa Mokona's artistic influence on the creators design?
About the relationships: The girl, you've gotta like her, but you gotta feel sorry for Cat & Rat, since they turn into animals is a girl's chest comes anywhere close. Also, Rat-kun is the object of desire of 2 men, so the series has BL. (for those of you who are STILL calling BL ""shounenai"", you REALLY need to stop. No one in Japan says it anymore)
I reccomend watching it in Japanese with English Subtitles, as the dubers didn't exactly do the best job & making the voices fit the characters.",1070150400,,794,4.482758620689655

All the characters are very well thought out, and there are numerous memorable lines.  This series has a little bit of everything- humor, romance, action, and mystery.  Everyone I know, young, old, girl, boy enjoys this series.  I reccomend this series for any anime fan.  The dubbed version is as well done as any anime I've seen and is fantastic and so is the subbed. This series has four discs and 26 episodes.

I typcially don't use the menus on the DVD to set up language & subtitles - the DVD player I have allows me to set those up direct from the remote. There are 2 sets of english subtitles...something I'd never seen before on an anime DVD. Be sure to pick the second set if you are a subtitle-only fan. The first set seems to drop a lot of subtlties, and there are no translations for the occasional Kanji or Hirigana.",1062460800,,547,4.219047619047619
1793917,5,B00006SFK7,"Fruits Basket is a must-see!  My first impression when my friend told me about it was that it will turn out to be a silly little anime with no plot whatsoever, but I was wrong.
Fruits Basket is a very deep(in my opinion) anime.  Tohru, the main character, is such a sweet girl.  She always thinks of others before herself.  At first I thought to myself ""She is such a goody-goody"", but as the anime went on, I saw that she really WAS sincere.  She wasn't doing anything to make an image, she did those things from the bottom of her heart.  Now why couldn't everyone be like that?
I found the anime rather funny.  It isn't a perverted type of funny.  Tohru is kind of a clutz, like Serena from Sailor Moon.  At first, she kept falling and hugging the guys making them transform at unconvenient places.
But I'm getting ahead of myself.  The Sohma family, the family that Yuki and the others belong to, are cursed.  Some of the family members transform into an animal of the Chinese Zodiac when they are hugged by the opposite sex, or their body's under a lot of stress.  Oh, but instead of having a dragon, they have a sea horse.  They also have the cat.  There was a story concerning it that will be told in the first episode.
I cried at a lot of places that truly touched my heart (most of them concerning Tohru).  In my opinion, this anime has a perfect blend of action, comedy, and tragedy.
A plus for girls like me is that the guys in this anime are cute!  In most animes you find one or if your lucky, two cute guys but in this, there are quite a lot.
I have seen many animes; Yu Yu Hakusho, Dragonball Z, Sailor Moon, Gundam Wing, Ronin Warriors, Inuyasha, Ranma 1/2, and Vampire Princess Miyu to name some; and this anime is by far my favorite.
Take my advice, watch Fruits Basket, or if you're still not sure after reading my review, search online for a summary on this anime.  I am looking forward to another DVD coming out.",1061164800,,1932,4.292817679558011
1793928,3,B00006SFK7,"Granted, Fruits Basket is very sweet and super-cute.  I know it's trying to take its time to build the characters and their relationships, but it gets to the point where it's TOO slow and TOO sweet and TOO cute.  If you really like saccharine, go for it, but after eight episodes of this anime I didn't see any reason to continue watching.
If you like Fruits Basket, you'll also like Haibane-Renmei.",1059609600,,399,4.605633802816901
1793929,5,B00006SFK7,"This series is SO cute.  Not cloying bishoujo cute.  Okay, it is bishoujo cute, but in a completely enjoyable, witty way.
This DVD has great replay value and will make you laugh and smile every time you watch it.  The characters are wonderful, the music is precious, the animation is bright and playful, and the dubbing is excellent.  I consider the dubbing almost or as good as that of 'Cowboy Bebop,' and I've seen episodes from both series multiple times, so I don't make this comparison lightly.
This is one of my favorite series, no question, and I'd encourage any anime fan to check it out.  It takes bishoujo conventions and alters the standard recipe with a dash of this and a pinch of that, and the overall effect is whimsical and thoroughly endearing.
Others have described the plot and characters, so I won't repeat what others have said.  Just watch this series.  You'll be doing yourself and your heart a favor.",1057536000,,924,4.666666666666667
1793930,5,B00006SFK7,"I heard of this series a whlie ago, but put off and put off seeing it, until I read a few reviews and thought I'd give it a go.
  Now, I only shake my head at myself for not getting it sooner.
  There are other reviews here with excellent plot summaries, so I won't go into that here.  I'll just try to explain why I think this series is so well worth seeing.
  The greatest strength of this anime is its ability to put such a variety of emotions into each episode.  On this volume, episode 5 in particular had me both laughing and crying- and at one point, a strange mixture of both.
  I think that's the overriding appeal of this series- it's fun, it's lighthearted, it's almost ridiculously hilarious in places, but it also has moments that touch you, and make you appreciate how good it feels to belong somewhere.  For that is one of, if not the, main themes- Tohru is a girl fundamentally alone, who discovers a place, and a family, who are willing to take her in and give her a place where she belongs, and without the need to change her own identity and sense of self.  At the same time, the Souma's, whom she stays with, feel that they aren't what a family should be, and while this is kind of true (it's not really 'normal' for a family to be cursed so that they turn into animals, is it? ^_^), Tohru helps them to see that a family is what you make it, it's how you treat and feel about the people you're close to.
  Okay, now it's sounding sappy, but these ideas are conveyed in 'Fruits Basket' without once feeling obvious or preachy.  It's more like, 'This is how life is, so let's get on with it and enjoy ourselves!'  This anime has a lot of conviction in its characters and in its simple, though valuable, ideals.
  I can't watch this anime without smiling and feeling good about life.  And isn't that what good anime is about?  I just keep re-watching all the episodes, too, and I still keep bursting out laughing every time.  If you want a break from the darker side of the anime spectrum, or just a good laugh, or some cute romance, I'm certain you'll really enjoy 'Fruits Basket'.",1057363200,3,2100,4.3061224489795915
1793931,5,B00006SFK7,"This anime is done very well, the story is cuddly but the characters have depth, which is hard to do. When I read the back of the DVD I immeadetly thought, ""Isn't this like 'Ranma 1/2'?"" But as your watching the show you can't make ANY Ranma 1/2 comparisons. The story is great! The director also did His and Her Circumstances another one of my favorite animes. I could find nothing wrong with this anime. WATCH IT :)!!!",1057104000,,420,4.397435897435898
1793932,5,B00006SFK7,"This is the most heart-warming and touching anime series I've ever seen. It's shoujo, meaning it's geared towards girls but anyone would enjoy watching this. It doesn't have games battles, transforming robots, or flying demons but my 11 yr old son loves watching it because of all the funny and outrageous characters (our favorites are Shigure, Kyo, Momiji & Ayame). Just 26 episodes long, it's a short series, although the manga comics are still ongoing in Japan.
You meet and get to know the cursed Sohma family through the eyes of orphaned high-school student Tohru Honda. Everyone has a story to tell, some quite heart-wrenching. I was touched by all their stories. Heck, I even felt sorry for Akito!
Although I prefer to watch anime in their original Japanese, I think that Funimation did a SUPERLATIVE job of dubbing and translating these series. In my opinion all the American voice actors were excellent! I really liked Laura Bailey as Tohru but my hat goes off to John Burgmeier who was just AWESOME as Shigure!
Only four volumes long, this is a worthwhile investment. BUY this and add an excellent anime series to your collection!",1057017600,6,1140,4.881443298969073
1793933,5,B00006SFK7,"It's hard to categorize Fruits Basket. It's not very action-oriented. It's probably aimed more at girls than boys, yet I think any number of people, male or female, young and old would enjoy it. The story seems simplistic on the surface. It could be called ""cute."" It could also be called ""sweet"" but I believe that those descriptions short change this rather complex story of how kindness, being true to yourself and trying to find the good points in everyone can be woven into an entertaining and satisfying story. Throw in plenty of drama, a hint of mystery, a little romance, some humor and you'll be hooked. Although it has it's sad moments, more often then not, this series will genuinely make you smile.
Fundamentally Fruits Basket is a story about finding your family,  a place where you can ""just be yourself"". When Tohru Honda loses her mother, the only family she has ever had, she is fortunate enough to stumble across the home of ""Prince"" Yuki, the most adored boy in her high school. When he and his older cousin Shigure learn of Tohru's circumstances (she's living in a tent) they offer her a place in their home in exchange for housework and cooking. This girl is possibly the only other person they will meet whose life is filled with as much sadness as theirs. Such bravery in the face of adversity touches their hearts, although you can be sure that Shigure is also happy to have hot, home-cooked meals everyday and clean laundry! Before she can truly appreciate her luck, she soon learns that her new family has a secret curse. When hugged by members of the opposite sex, or when under a great deal of stress, they turn into the animals of the Chinese Zodiac. Although the transformations sometimes are used playfully, the Sohma's truly are burdened by their curse.  Tohru promises maintain their secret and thereby is allowed to stay with them.  The greatest transformation of them all might be when the one the Sohmas undergo by opening their hearts and home to Tohru
This first disc has 6 episodes, all of which are outstanding. They introduce the core characters, set up the tone and direction of the story, and each one builds on the other in a logical and satisfying progression. The main characters are of course, Tohru Honda, an ordinary girl who has known plenty of sadness in her life, but is also able to find happiness. You also meet the Sohmas, Yuki, the charming and emotionally reserved ""prince"" of high school, his goofy but generous older cousin Shigure, whose house they live in, as well Yuki's hated rival, the short-tempered and brash, Kyo. You also catch a glimpse the mysterious and sinister Akito Sohma, head of the family who conditionally allows Tohru to stay. He is a dark and menacing presence that is seldom seen, yet always felt and his promise to have Tohru's memory erased remains a constant threat to fragile happiness of Tohru and the Sohmas. We also meet Tohru's steadfast friends, the weird Hana who senses electrical signals and Uo, a former gang member as well as Tohru's beloved mother, seen only in flashback.
As Tohru adjusts to her new life in Shigure's house, she comes to know each of the boys a little better, often seeing their good qualities when they can't see any for themselves. It's such a simple thing, yet it's easy to see how that, coupled with Tohru's willingness to make the best of any situation and her unfailing kindness begin to make a difference in all of the Sohma's lives. Perhaps she can even bring Yuki and Kyo, who loathe each other's guts, if not into friendship, at least to an understanding of each other. The standout episode on this disc is number 5, where Tohru is torn between her new-found family with the Sohmas and returning to her old life with her paternal grandfather, where she just doesn't quite fit in. It nicely encapsulates all of the good qualities of the story so far, and further illustrates the profound effect that her short stay with the Sohmas has already had on them.
In addition to the wonderful story, the animation is done beautifully. The lines are crisp, elegant and spare. I really liked the muted colors and pastels that are used and the music is gentle as well. Taken all together it gives the whole series a certain restful quality in keeping with the story that is more about characters and emotions then action.  I applaud FUNamation for putting together such a nice package and for putting 6 episodes on one disc, as well as some nice extras. If you are at all like me, you'll devour the first disc and be ready for the second in no time. I had to go out the next night and buy the rest of the DVDs since I couldn't wait to finish the story. Fruits Basket is a really unique anime that is off the beaten path and well worth your while. It's become my new favorite anime series and hope many people discover it's wonderful qualities and enjoy it as much as I did.",1055808000,33,4885,4.61795166858458
1793934,5,B00006SFK7,"Don't get me wrong, but I'm not a huge shoujo fan.  I'm a grrrl and I far prefer the boy's toys. *wicked grin*  My favorite things to watch are sci-fi epics, fantasy and action-adventure type stuff... but... but... this is one of the most heartwarming, heart-wrenching and HUMAN anime I have ever run across...
I cried.  At several parts.  You think YOUR family is disfunctional?  HA.  You ain't met the Sohmas yet... *shivers* They are _severely_ messed up - but trying very, very hard to deal anyway.  Other reviewers have given details on plot and situation.  The curse.  The transformations.  But those are just window-dressing to the real human issues; love, friendship, acceptance, compassion, grief, personal strength, loyalty, finding your place in the world, growing up, moving on.  All tough questions.  Few easy answers.  These are just humans trying to get through their lives the best they can, recovering from their problems the best they can and trying to understand life the best they can... until they discover this one girl... Tohru Honda.  She's not the brightest, she doesn't have *all* the answers, and she doesn't always do exactly the right thing every time, but what Tohru does best is simply accept them and love them - despite their rough edges and twisted lives and terrible curses.  And slowly, painfully the Sohmas come to love and accept her in return.
I simply can't fully express how wonderful, wrenching and uplifting I found this series.  Not in a silly, sappy way either.  But in a way that makes one look at one's own life and go, hey, yeah, with friends and loved ones, you _can_ get through the tough times too.  No matter what.
This is a lovely series.  Give it a try. If you make it through Momiji's full story without crying too (or at least tearing up a bit)... well then... I'd worry.
Besides... the clever Ka-Ching wipes are almost worth the whole show... *grin*",1055289600,,1906,4.791411042944786

That anxious, head in the clouds feeling?  And I have a amazing tolerance for mean people this week. And perhaps the weirdest thing about it is that I think I actually have a crush on sixteen year old cartoon character, and yet I am okay with it.  Did I tell you I felt strange.  I just finished watching The entire Fruits Basket
series for the second time.
Fruits Basket is a powerful series.  The story of a high school girl, Tohru Honda, who by sheer chance, after the death of her mother, gets invited to move into a house with three really cute guys.  One of them, Yuki, is actually Mr. Popularity at her high school, I mean what luck!  But the real surprise is that these three guys, who are all completely huggable, will transform into members of the Chinese Zodiac should a member of the opposite sex actually hug them... or fall on them, or run into them... a lot of transforming going on, and did I mention that they are naked when they transform back?  Really, great fun, but this is only a tiny little piece of a truly wonderful story.
The true brilliance of this anime comes from the characters relationships.  The characters in Fruits Basket are all basically good, but desperately flawed.  Imagine spending your entire life forced to avoid any kind of intimacy, or friendship, with the outside world for fear you will accidentally transform into an animal.  The story does a brilliant job at conveying the pain and loneliness of the cursed Sohma family, as well as the love/hate relationships within the family.  On one hand you have the kooky cursed members of the Sohma family.  Even the most evil member of the family, Akito, has a strange sort of beauty about him.  You find yourself wanting to heal their pain, you very much want to hug these guys.  On the opposite end you have Tohru, a sweet naive girl who only wants to please everyone around her.  Add to this mix Tohru's weird  friends and the crazy fan club girls who have staked claim to the innocent and unknowing Yuki.  And you have your Fruits Basket.  A wonderful addictive series that will have you laughing uncontrollably one moment and near tears the next.  After I watched and loved all 26 episodes, I knew it had worked its way deep into my heart. I do not know of any plans to continue the series but I truly hope that the series will continue, and that more episodes will make there way to America.  In the meanwhile, I will enjoy the happy little cloud that experiencing this series has left me in.  Just watch this series, I promise it will make you smile.",1054339200,,2723,4.504081632653061

It is shoujo and meant for girls but both genders are fans of this series. This is a series that deals with relationships in a very interesting way. The viewer along with Tohru will learn the querks of each of the Sohmas and why they are the way they are. As she learns about them, she learns about herself. Human interrelations can be difficult which is intensified by the Sohma curse. No matter how old or young you are, you may recognize the traits in the characters. The series is as nice as the intro song. This is a heartwarming series with a bit of a shocking end. But be warned, always have tissues available.

1793947,4,B00006SFK7,"The cover fools you.  When I first saw this title, I thought it was going to be totally syrupy, thus boring.  I was wrong.  This is a romantic comedy, and its done well.
Tohru appears to be a naive, and an almost bland girl, but she's not.  She is sweet, and kind beyond belief.  The eccentric characters around her balance her kindness with strangness.  Tohru's world is full of guys who tranform into animals, if hugged by her (or any member of the opposite sex), her pals, one of whom is a former gang menber, and a gothic psychic.  There is als a fiecely territoral ""Prince Yuki"" fan club, who resents Tohru for walking to school with Yuki Sohma, the ""prince"" of the high school.
The Sohma curse is outrageous, which you've likely read already, transforms them into animals of the Chinese zodiac when hugged by a memeber of the opposite sex.  Tohru stumbles onto this fact, which was supposed to be a secret, and things get crazier from there.
The Sohma family is filled with rivalry, and hilarious relationships.  Tohru keeps their secret, while having a positive effect on the secertive Sohmas.  Its clear she has feelings for Yuki, but also for Kyo, and he's so macho and short-tempered, he's next to impossible to be freindly, but Tohru reaches him as well.
The series mixes humor, drama, and action, making it very entertaining.  There is also a dark, mystery behind the curse.  It pops out from time to time. It adds another level to the series.  More Sohmas appear as the series progresses, causing all sorts of trouble for each other and for Tohru.

She's a lovely girl, the kind that doesn't really exist in real life! *laugh* Honestly, she's extremely mature and giving, kind and sincere. I don't know what that reviewer wanted. But I'm very happy with her.
Being a fanatic, I'd like to point out that the main characters are voiced by fantastic seiyuu, Horie Yui and Hisakawa Aya in particular stand out as amazing examples of the skill of the Japanese voice actors.

After her mother died in a car crash and her grandfather not having the money to support her she decides she will live in a tent in the woods until she can get back on her feet.  But one day on her way to school she come across a house and learns that its the house of Yuki soma (the prince of her high school) and yes its true, Yuki is cutedespite him being a little creepy at times (in my opinion anyways)
But there is more to Yuki and his family then meets the eye. In fact to understand there secret its not eyes that have to meet, but skin (yes bad joke on my part ^^; forgive me) As Tohru soon learns, when ever a member of Yukis family gets hugged by someone of the opposite sex. they transform into one of the 12 animals of the Chinese Zodiac.
Ok. Yes I know your all thinking Hmm, not to original, Iv seen this before in Ranma (theres even Haru. Who, like Ryoga has a horrid sense of direction) But I tell you now, Fruits Basket is nothing like Ranma, its more down to reality, the characters are more believable and there situations seem real. (Dont get me wrong, I LOVE Ranma, this is different though)
But now its time for my opinion on Fruits basket:
This series is great! Its already one of my favorites, after watching it I had to watch it again, and again, and again until I knew it by heart.  Fruits basket is heartwarming, its funny, cute, and even a little Romanic at times (but you cant have a good series with out a little romance now can you?) But its not mushy and won't put you to sleep, and when it starts to get a little two sappy and you get a little tired, you cant drift off to sleep because one of the characters will blurt out something funny and the boredom will end shortly.
Also if your sick of school girl travels to another world stories or animes that involve high school students saving the world from destructions Give fruits basket a try. The charters are WONDERFULL, there wasn't once I didn't like. I even found myself getting attached to Akito (being, mainly the villain in this storyif you can even call him that.) I like Tohru as well which is strange cause I usually find myself not liking the mane female character, they always seem to winery or too nice for there own good. Sure Tohru is nice, but the way she is believable.
This series is a must for anyone who likes cute stories, with out to much mush, remembered characters. And that won't bore the daylights out of you.

She is determined to finish school in order to fulfill her mother's last wish. It turns out that the land Toru is living on belongs to the Soma family.

The members of the Soma family are possessed by animals and they turn into their true selves when they are embraced by the opposite sex!

1793954,4,B00006SFK7,"If you've ever heard of this anime series chances are that you may think it's over rated, when in truth it's not!  Here is what it says on the back:
Toru Honda is a cheerful 16 year old girl. She was orphaned when her mother was killed in a car accident. Not wanting to burden anyone, she buys a tent and begins to live in a forest. She is determined to finish school in order to fulfill her mother's last wish. It turns out that the land Toru is living on belongs to the Soma family. She is quickly invited to live in the Soma house (all males), as long as she is willing to cook and clean. One of the Soma's, Yuki, is the most popular boy at Toru's high school. He is swooned by girls constantly and is even referred to as the ""prince"" of the school. His cousins Shigure, Yuki's guardian, and Kyo make up the rest of the household. Toru knows that her living environment is out of the norm, but things turn out to get stranger. The members of the Soma family are possessed by animals and they turn into their true selves when they are embraced by the opposite sex! You can imagine Toru's surprise when she witnesses their secret. She promises not to tell a soul, but the ""cat"" may already be out of the bag.
Of course what is the main attraction to dvds compared to vhs are the Special bonuses like:

1793955,5,B00006SFK7,"In short, ""Fruits Basket"" is the best series I have seen in a long time. It's hilarious, heartfelt, and deep all at the same time. Although the medium is anime(Japanese animation) which I usually tend to think of as quite unrealistic, this is an astoundingly believable story. The writing is some of the best I have ever seen. Let me elaborate for you.
First of all, some background on the series is needed if you've never seen it. The series is based around a girl named Tohru. Tohru's mother died one year before the series began and when we come in on the story(the first episode) her grandfather, whom she'd been living with, is renovating the house. He goes to stay with other family, but asks Tohru to stay with a friend so she won't miss school. Well, not wanting to impose upon her friends, Tohru pitches a tent in the forest. The land she's camping on happens to belong to the family of a classmate named Yuki Sohma. Three cousins, one being Yuki, invite her to live with them. There, Tohru soon learns the dark secret of the Sohma's. They are all cursed to turn into animals of the Chinese Zodiac when embraced by the opposite sex of non-family members.
I have searched for a long time for something like this. This series not only helps me better understand who I am, but who I want to be. The characters are just so very well constructed that I can't help but love every one of them. There is something in every character, a characteristic, like unexplained anger, solemnity and mystery, or silliness that is just too eerily familiar. They remind me of myself. This is something that cannot be explained in words, but only through experience. This series has given me one more step forward towards understanding my life. There is a deep underlying theme to this series, and that is if you just be yourself, you will be fine.
As for the whole ""cursed to turn into animals"" thing, it may not be exactly ""believable"" as I stated in my summary, but it is an ingenious device that allows the writers to develop a schlew(that's the technical term) of analogies that make you(or me anyway) slap your forehead and go ""Oh my god! That's what I've been trying to figure out about myself forever!"" Well, not literally, but you get the point.
Aside from the deep end of it, lets move onto heartfelt. A relationship develops gradually between each character. You don't really even notice just how much you care about this relationship until they threaten to tear it apart once or twice. Out of respect for people who haven't seen it, I'll leave it at that. But I think it is a stroke of genius on the writers part. It makes you realize just how much you care about what's going on, and it keeps you eagerly anticipating the next episode.
And, oh yes, for anyone who doesn't get into all of that mushy stuff, and deep philosophical ..., this is also a comedy. This series has made me laugh harder than shows that are meant to make you laugh. And the best part is, the writers know when to be serious, and when to be funny so that they don't ruin something that could've been great. They made darn well sure that this would be great and nothing short of it.
To sum this up, I laughed, I cried, and then I thought about it. And then I laughed some more. And I recommend ""Fruits Basket"" to anyone. And I wish happiness and enlightenment to anyone who is fortunate enough to set eyes upon this beauty.",1045699200,6,3395,4.47741935483871
1793976,5,B00006SFK7,"I've watched a lot of anime over the past few years, and my list of favorites is quite long, but this anime series tops the list.  The story is very well done and the character development is satisfying. Even the minor characters are memorable and the main characters really hook the viewer with their personal struggles and triumphs.
When I saw the first episode, I thought, ""Oh no, this is soooo cute I'm not sure I can handle all the sweetness,"" but then, the story began and I started laughing.  Once you start laughing with Furuba (as the fans call it), you don't stop. The comedy occaisionally borders on the slapstick or the bizarre, but it's always in context and, by the end of the series, you want to watch it all over again.
I definitely reccomend this to anyone who wants to watch a really good, funny anime, which I think will become a classic title.
 :)",1044662400,,867,4.474683544303797
1793977,5,B00006SFK7,"First of all, let me start off by saying that this dvd blew me away.  I had never heard of the series and kept picking up the box every time I went to my local movie retailer.  After Christmas, I decided to get it.  I was expecting some lame rip off of Ranma 1/2, but that couldn't be farther from the truth.
The story is based around the cute and honorable Tohru Honda. A few years before our story starts, her mother dies an early death.  Tohru already had no father, so she was left parentless.  She ends up living with her inviting and loving grandfather.  At the beginning of our story, she happens to walk past the house of the Sohma family (by the way, while her grandfather is doing repairs on the house, she is living alone in a tent in the woods!!).  She meets Shigure, who is painting chinese zodiac characters.  She then finds out ""Prince Yuki"", the cutest and most mysterious guy at school, lives there as well.  They end up becoming friends, and they invite her to live there while her grandfather's renovations are going on.
That's where the story really begins.  Tohru finds out, quite by accident, that the Sohma family is cursed!  Every time one of them is embraced by a member of the opposite sex, they turn into their chinese zodiac animal!  Shigure is the dog, Yuki is the rat, and their relative Kyo is the cat?  I won't spoil everything, you'll have to watch it to find out what else happens.  The story focuses a lot on character relationships with plenty of comedy to keep it from getting too serious.
On a technical side, the animation for this anime is absolutely superb.  The colors are great, the drawings and character designs are fantastic, and they all flow together quite nicely.  Plus, there are great extras, like character profiles, plus the dvd has 6 episodes.  It's well worth the $... extra for this awesome story.  I recommend this for fans of Ranma 1/2, His and Her Circumstances, and Love Hina.",1043193600,8,1936,4.514367816091954
1793978,5,B00006SFK7,This is a really really really good series! I just finished watching all 26 episodes (fan-subbed) and I LOVED it! This is a great show whether you're new to anime or an otaku! This is GOOOOOOOOOD! It's...Just....So....COOL! *sobb* If only there was more!,1041638400,2,254,4.930232558139535
1793979,5,B00006SFK7,"What I love about anime is many stories are more than what they seem on the surface such as this one which one could throw in the school-girl/magical group, but it's also about the fears which many teens experience in Jr High/High school of fitting in, making friends/opening up to others mixed with an interesting horoscope twist.
I was a bit disappointed on the credits(Funimation leans toward listing the actors names without linking them to their character). The English cast is full of the Texas Dragonball Z cast--Laura Bailey(Chi Chi, child Trunks), Eric Vale(Teen Trunks), Meredith McCoy(Android 18),& John Burgmeier & Jerry Jewel(haven't matched them to the characters yet, but I've seen them in the DBZ credits). The Japanese cast is even more familiar-Yuki is Aya Hisakawa(Sailor Moon's Sailor Mercury & Cardcaptor Sakura's Kero), Tomokazu Seki(Escaflowne's Van, Cardcaptor Sakura's Touya, GTO's Kunio & Real Bout's Kusanagi to name a few) is Kyo, & Yuka Imai & Ryotaro Okiayu(Excel Saga's Matsuya & Watanabe & Burn Up Excess's Rio & Yuji) are Arisa & Shigure. Kotono Mitsuishi(Excel, Sailor Moon, Dragon-Half's Mink) is Kagura(poor Kyo!), one of the characters I haven't warmed to, but like Tohru, I love kitties. According to my source Blue Seed's Kusanagi(Kazuhiko Inoue) voices Hatori Soma.
The Yuki fan club are frighteningly familiar(shades of the Revolutionary Girl Utena chorus/shadows), but not too intrusive yet. I like Kyo best as he seems to have the most distance to cover to becoming domesticated, but Yuki also has the traces of untamed skitishness in his approach to friendship with those outside the Soma family. Shigure is funny in both languages. The sleep-over ep is hilarious--I look forward to the rest of the series.",1037145600,5,1750,5.2313167259786475

Edited: To remove '' that appeared in place of apostrophes.

There are a lot of excellent reviews here describing the series, so if you're looking for info on the anime, look elsewhere. If, however, you want to know how this DVD stacks up to the original version, read on.

Voices: B
First off, I should say that I was introduced to the series through fansubs so I have a bias toward the original voices. Sadly, I must admit that I find Tohru's English voice on the annoying end of the spectrum. Innocence and youth are usually connected but in the original Japanese version, Tohru's voice was sweet and innocent, but not necessarily 'young' sounding. In this English dubbed version our high school aged heroine sounds like a squeaky ten year old. However, that's just my opinion. Others might not have a problem with her voice. Tohru's voice could have been better, but I must admit that it could have been a lot worse. Wednesday evening will find me rewatching my DVD in the hopes that I'll learn to enjoy her voice.

Kyo's voice isn't really remarkable one way or the other. His English voice isn't bad, but it's not excellent.

Yuki's English voice, although nice, is quite deep and far from the alto that he has in the Japanese version... to the point that most of the time, Yuki sounds much older than Shigure. He also tends to be rather emotionless when delivering his lines. Yuki's keyword would be 'subtlety' so this doesn't work in his favor.

On the positive side, Shigure's voice actor deserves some applause. The English voice absolutely matches his character and can keep pace with Shigure's quick-changing emotions. He also gets most of the best English dialogue lines. (See the translation section.)

As a last note to voices... I found it sometimes difficult to follow the English dialogue because there is no change in sound quality to signify thoughts. Speaking voices and thinking voices are the same and I find myself missing the misty, echoing quality that usually accompanies spoken thoughts.

Translation: A+
Between my own extensive knowledge of Japanese language and the aforementioned fansubs, I consider myself a fairly decent judge of the translation job. The DVD is rated 13+ so fans can hear all of the mild Japanese swear words in their English counterparts. On the whole, I was impressed with the quality of the translation. The English dialogue sticks very close to the Japanese, but avoids the awkward sentences that sometimes occur with direct translation. Departures are made with good reason.

On this first DVD there are two spots that stick out in my mind where the English did -not- follow the Japanese. In the first example, it looks like FUNimation is trying to interject some humor. Rather than being angry about it though, I appreciate it since it matches Shigure's personality.

Shigure (Episode 5) Japanese: ""However, his becoming angry at you, Tohru-kun, is what you would call misdirected rage. Though I do understand why he would miss her.""
English: ""We've just witnessed a classic example of what I like to call 'misdirected rage.' ... I believe the technical term is 'being an a$$'?""

The second example also injects humor, but it also serves to circumvent a potentially confusing cultural reference. Frankly, I find Shigure's English comment more appropriate to the situation.

(Episode 2) Yuki volunteers to help Tohru clean the kitchen. Shigure responds to Tohru:

Shigure Japanese: ""Yuki-kun is so maladroit, he can't even fold a paper crane properly.""
Shigure English: ""You'd better not. The closest thing Yuki's ever seen to a mop is his hair.""

Music: A
The opening and ending songs, ""For Fruits Basket"" and ""Chisana Inori"" have been remade into similar sounding English versions that manage to incorporate both the style and meaning of the originals into the songs. They're actually pretty good and, of course, the originals are there on the Japanese audio track for purists. Other background music seems to have been redone on the English track as well, but don't quote me on it.

Subtitles: C-
There are two sets of subtitles -- one that matches the English dialogue and one that translates the Japanese dialogue. They're accurate, so why am I complaining?  Horrible graphical quality. As a literature student, I do a lot of reading. I love watching things subtitled. But even with my glasses, I can't watch these subtitles for long. They're narrow, jagged, and overall hard on the eyes. The animation style of FB is so smooth, the ugly yellow subtitles hurt to look at. Are decent-looking subtitles really that difficult to produce?????

Extras: A
What would DVDs be without perks? Well, perhaps to make up for the ridiculous price, FUNi has included some nice extra features. There are the standard textless openings and endings and the standard character profiles... but the really cool feature of the DVD is the subtitled featurette focusing on the anime's creation. I'd seen the featurette before and was pleasantly surprised to see it included on the DVD. It's roughly 25 minutes long and has interviews with the director, his assistants, and the Japanese voice actors. Let me tell ya, it's really cool to see the faces behind the voices.

Overall: A-
My biggest complaints are with Tohru's voice actress and the poor quality subtitles. Everything else is excellent. The voices I'll eventually get used to and as for the subtitles, hopefully someone at FUNimation will do something about them (but that's not likely to happen). So my recommendation: BUY IT! Support Fruits Basket in the US and buy the...DVD. From what I've heard, DVDs 1 and 2 will have six episodes each and the last two will have seven episodes each (for a grand total of 26 wonderful episodes). I'm eagerly looking forward to the next DVD coming out in January.",1035763200,23,5835,4.943820224719101

1793982,5,B00006SFK7,"Most romantic comedies written so far are one-sided, either they are shoujo or shounan.  The anime that have made the transition into the American market are mostly shounan.  Fruits Basket offers a balance between the two, which makes it more real than anything you have seen before.  Imagine Keitaro living in a girl's dorm with 5 lovely girls in Love Hina, Tohru is the counterpart who lives in a ""man's dorm"" with 3 good-looking guys plus frequent visitors from their family.
Fruits Basket follows the story of a first year high school girl named Tohru Honda and her encounters with the Souma family who has a secret involving the Chinese Zodiac or Juunishi.  Almost every Souma member carries a painful baggage behind his or her back.  We feel the emotions, the pain, and the laughter as each episode unfolds new revelation into the lives of the Souma family and how Tohru helps bring about change in the family.
The emphasis the writers of the story focuses on is not the removal of the scar, but the recovery from the pain and the change in one's perspective in life.  Using Tohru as the change catalyst, the writers unveil a new understanding behind the emotions such as anger, jealousy, frustration, hatred, hurt, low self-esteem, and hopelessness, and bring them to a final conclusion of forgiveness, acceptance, renewal, and love.  Our heroine, Tohru, turns out to be the messenger of all comfort.  She brought a whole new perspective in the affirmation of one's self-esteem.  Although Tohru is a very sweet girl, she is not the ""homecoming queen"" type that most guys crave on.  In fact, Yuri did not even notice her in class before she walked into his life (moved into Shigure's house.)  Tohru lacks imagination and is very dumb sometimes.  But you will find her an amazing character once you get to know her.
Growing up in America often sway us into abusing the right to free speech.  We use honesty as our disguise to blast every word and thought we have in mind, and much too often to the ones we love most.  We carry the sign, ""forgive and forget,"" but how much pain your heart can withstand until it breaks?  The writers of Fruits Basket show us how to treasure our relationships with our friends and love ones, how to be kind to one another, and how to mend broken relationships.  In the end, it is faith, love, and hope that will heal the past and carry us forward.
Indeed, there are moments when you need lots of Kleenex, especially the episode on Hatori but the anime also balances itself with lots of laughter.  It's like life.  There are moments when you would cry and there are moments when you would laugh.  Unlike most comedy that are filled with perverted jokes, Fruits Basket makes you laugh because the circumstances are real and you identify with them.  The first half of the series is very engaging-no cliffhangers but a lot of discovery into the characters' past.  The second half has some fillers that are really not necessary.
The series premiered in Japan starting July 5, 2001.  As such, the animation and character artwork are very modern, crisp, and fluid.  The characters are in the ""kawaii"" style with big eyes and clean-cut appearance.  I love the original voice actors although I had a hard time following the subtitles.  (They talk too fast!)  I am looking forward to watching Fruit Baskets in English.  Although the anime spans 26 episodes, it only covers up to volume 6 of the original Fruits Basket manga.  By the time I got to episode 26, I found myself asking for one more season.",1035244800,13,3527,4.691056910569106
1793983,5,B00006SFK7,"(As of the time this review was written, no information on this series is posted, so I'll give a brief synopsis of this series.)
Fruits Basket (called ""Furuba"" by fans) is the story of Tohru Honda, a high school student who has lost both of her parents. Her mother died only a year before the start of the series, and Touru misses her so much that she always carries her picture around with her. Tohru was living with her paternal grandfather until he began renovations on his home, so he asked her if she'd mind staying with some friends for awhile. Touru didn't want to impose on either of her friends, so she decided to set up a tent in the woods until the house was finished.. until one day she stumbles across the home of her classmate Yuki Sohma, and accidentally discovers his family's BIG secret - when ""huggled"" by someone of the opposite sex, they are cursed to turn into the animals of the Chinese zodiac. Tohru ends up moving in with the Sohma family as a housekeeper/cook in exchange for room and board, and she is introduced one-by-one to the rest of the clan (some of whom are.. VERY.. unusual).
Now, you might be telling yourself ""I've seen this before, and it's name was 'Ranma 1/2'.."" - and you have NO IDEA how very wrong you are. Fruits Basket is a one of a kind series that manages to take a premise that could very well have followed the same path as Ranma (namely, relying on perverted jokes and accidental transformations to convey most of the plot and comedy), but instead becomes a chronicle of truly believable characters struggling to belong and dealing with what life has given them, both the good and bad.
Over the course of its 26 episodes, Fruits Basket has made me laugh harder than any other anime I've ever seen, and then it goes right ahead and takes me on an emotional rollercoaster ride until I'm bawling along with the characters onscreen. But no matter what happened, it always leaves me with a smile and a feeling that if I could just have an ounce of the inner strength that these characters display, I would be all the better for it.
Don't let me mislead you into thinking this is merely a cheesy tearjerker - Fruits Basket has PLENTY of high-energy martial arts battles, slapstick comedy, and wacky plot twists, but underneath all of this lies a deep emotional current that EVERYONE can connect with. If you've ever been jealous or angry with your family, undergone the loss of a close relative, felt completely alone, watch the people you love leave you behind, or have simply been misunderstood, you will regret missing this series. The true power of this series is found not in the comedy, but in the relationships between both family and friends.
On a more shallow level, the characters are mostly rather good-looking, the animation is attractive - no amazing special effects, of course, but consistently high quality and well-suited to the story, and the music is very beautiful. Overall, this is a series for everyone to see, from the shoujo (girls') romance fans to comedy lovers to drama affectionados. You will NOT be disappointed - by episode 26, I guarantee you'll find yourself upset that ANOTHER season doesn't exist (yet). ^_^",1034812800,166,3184,4.657193605683837
1793984,5,B00006SFK7,"With so much anime coming out in Japan, it's hard to really be able to watch them all or even a large fraction of them.  Then you also take into consideration the fact that another fraction is taken to come to America.  From all this, a gem comes along and that's exactly what Fruits Basket is.  Fruits Basket is definitely one anime that people should see.
Fruits Basket, spanning 26 episodes, is the story of a high school girl, Tohru Honda, who lives by herself in a tent outside now that her mother had passed away in an accident and her grandfather was staying with other relatives.  Tohru is an extremely sincere, naive, compassionate person.  How anyone could portray such depth to these feelings in one person is beyond me.  She gets these from her mother who she loved deeply.  She stayed true to her words and morals and to help others and be herself.  The last thing she ever wanted to be was a burden on others and that is why she doesn't tell her friends about her living situation.  Her whole life changed after being able to stay with the ""Prince"" Yuki Souma and relative, Shigure.  The twist is that the Souma family has the curse of the Juunishi, The Twelve Animals of the Chinese Zodiac.  When hugged by the opposite sex, they will change into their respective animal counterpart.  The Soumas all have problems in their lives that all come down to their curse.  Yet, Tohru has this amazing ability to help all of them with their problems.  It's very heartwearming and definitely a tear-jerker.
I must say that it is a little weird that Funimation has picked up this title.  For those who don't know, Funimation specializes in releasing more action-oriented titles like Dragon Ball Z, Yu Yu Hakusho, and later on, One Piece.  Picking up a more emotional title was a total surprise.  The problem I have with this DVD is that the packaging does not look pleasing at all.  The logo for Fruits Basket seems too ordinary and does nothing for the cover.  The picture of Tohru just doesn't seem right for a cover art.  I think it would have been better to showcase more cast of characters with at least a contrasting background of trees or something else.
This anime is relatively new so the visual quality should be nice.  The theme songs are very nice.  Both the opening and ending fit the story very well.  It relates to the characters and the story and is very mellow and soft which fits with the emotional aspects.
Another problem I have with this release is the fact the price goes for a retail of 40 dollars.  It's good that they released 6 episodes on this DVD but 40 dollars is just too much.  Many other companies have released 5-7 episodes with just the normal retail price of 30 dollars.  I guess I could understand if there were extras added with the DVD but I don't think there is.
Final Note:  Even through the higher price, this is a show that is really amazing.  If you love emotional and light-hearted anime, then this is for you.  If you just like action or any others, then give it a try.  It really wouldn't hurt.  You might find yourself falling in love with it too.  Words just really can't express the way I feel about this anime and I don't want to spoil anything but in ways, it really is like ""Chicken Soup for your Soul.""",1034553600,10,3259,4.480475382003395

7973233,4,B00006SFK7,"Fruits Basket is a great anime. It's about an orphaned girl who goes to live with a family of shape shifters. The members of the Sohma family are cursed. When they touch a member of the opposite sex they turn into a different animal in the Chinese Zodiac. The story follows Tohru and her life with this weird family.

I had a great time watching this anime and I think it's fantastic. That being said; it lacked something that could have made it a lot better. Emotion. There were some touching moments. Like the story of the family's doctor, and the ending where Kyo turns into his true form. If the relationships between the characters were developed a little more, instead of everyone being so stand offish the whole time those moments could have been more memorable. I'm not bashing this series at all. I actually really like it. My point is that it had way more potential than was actually achieved.

The animation in Fruits Basket is high quality. The soundtrack and voice acting are also very good. The anime was produced masterfully. It's a classic, but it's a far cry from being one of the best anime's of all time. That being said it's definitely not one to miss.",1354060800,,1172,4.549763033175355

I had a problem with something it was the voices! Blah!Tohru's squeaky and annoying(but loveable!)!I cried and laughed. It took me to the edge of my seat! There is all the action in one sitting.

My second problem was the voices again,and how they change in japanese and english. Plus,some more voices. Let's start with the voices. Ok! Yuki's ok...but what I love most is the japanese voice. And I'm not saying that because a famouse japanese pop singer makes charming Yuki's voice. Kyo's voice got a little bit annoying but it was not bad...or good. But it was still something. Shigure...Shigure...his voice,perfection! Still the humor just right!

Now for the good things! Japanese mode/languge was perfect. I adored it! But heres somthing really funny! I watched all fruits basket episodes in one day in the same room on the same chair just sitting there watching all of them in one sitting without getting up. Back to the good things,wait one more bad thing...the subtitles,BLAH!Yellow squished toghether.
Not floating my boat. Tohru is not the brightest flower in the garden,but she was made that way! Finally back to the good things! Ok Shigure's voice, check! Humor though,not working. It's WAY TO OVER RATED!!!!!!Any way,What happens in episode one is...oh! By the way this is kind of a spoiler.

Any way,Tohru lives in a tent alone,after her loving mother passed away(her dad died while she was very young.)The only sorce of hope she has is her friends Uo,and Hana. But then while walking to shool she noticed some cute zodiac cookies(or whatevers)she smiled then noticed Shigure(the dog)who then asked ""you like theese!?!I'm  surprised!"" or something like that then they talked about the cat an how the banquet and rat. It goes somthing like this ""One day,God invited all the members of the zodiac to a banquet but the mischevious rat told the cat that the party was the day after. So,the cat missed the banquet and the rat rode on to the cow the lead."" So...Ya! Then she says she's a dog and Shigure Says""Oh I know somebody whoms a dog"". Then Yuki (the ""PRINCE"" of her school or as they call him""Prince Yuki"") comes in and hits Sigure over the head with his back pack.

Then Shigure asks ""a dictionary!?!"" Yuki responds ""two!"" then Yuki asks Tohru if she'd walk to school with him. Then fan girls come along and spelled""WE LOVE YUKI!!!!"". Yes Yuki has his own fanclub. Then when they get to school they see the fanclub girls. Then Tohru's BFFS and they hug her and stuff. Then when she walks home this leads to some tender moments with Yuki.

  MAIN  CHARACTERS:
Yuki(the rat),Tohru(the riceball. Well,she does not turn into one but...),Shigure(the dog),Kyo(the cat).
  Tohru's Friends:
Hana(sences electrical waves),and last but not least Uo(Kyo's other villan...Yuki's one too! Like cat and rat,or as Uo and Hana called it Tom and Jerry).

I Recemend everyone said this but BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!",1308700800,,3040,4.823076923076923
7973235,5,B00006SFK7,"I absolutely LOVE this series, both the anime and the manga! It's definitely very 'cutesy', but it still manages to be relatable at the same time. I just wish the anime had gone on as long as the manga, but the ending still feels like a conclusion, so there's no real problem there.",1207180800,,282,4.339622641509434
