3080214,2,B00127RAKI,"I saw the trailer for this film on HD NET and it looked promising. I was happy to hear that I was going to get a free sneak peak showing opening night in my home on HD NET! The movie is about a group of campers who go to Ireland to do ""shrooms"" or ""magic mushrooms""(what they were called in my day)in the woods. Having dabbled in many things in my youth, I know this is a bad, BAD idea! The films starts off like so many other horror movies going to unfamiliar surroundings to party and have sex, then tell a scary story to freak everyone out before going to bed. Lots of clich's fill this watch-able but, ultimately forgettable horror film. I did like the ending a little, as it seemed to make this all seem possible. If you see it coming on cable you might want to give it a look but, it's nothing special just a time waster.",1201910400,13,827,4.111111111111111

It was one of the few movies that actually scared me that I had seen in a long time. I absolutely love scary movies but I have a really hard time finding any that are actually scary to me so this was quite a feat. I recommended this movie to a lot of people after originally watching it. That was several years ago and I was looking for a good scary movie so I decided to watch Shrooms again but I found hat knowing e ending it wasn't anywhere near as scary as it was when I had watched it before. Watching it again was just kind of Ho hum for me. So I would recommend watching this movie at least once because the first time watching it was definitely the best!",1475452800,2,899,4.0

Three mushrooms making the face of a skull silhouetted against the face of a full moon at night in the dark forest.  Great marketing!  The movie?  Well, the acting was terrific.  Three pretty girls and some dudes go into the forest and end up tasting some mushrooms with a dark nipple on top of them that cause bizzare convulsions, hallucinations and visions of the future.  They run a lot in the forest.  Meet some strange not so well meaning hermits.  And then it begins . . . It . . . It all . . . BEGINS!  Between three and a half, and four stars. O.K?

3080326,1,B00127RAKI,"I frankly don't care what chemicals responsible adults put into their bodies, so if you psilocybin's your thing, hey, have a great trip, but don't do Shrooms, the horror movie.

Some horror movies are just so by rote that all you really need to say about them is they contain every clich&eacute; parodied so successfully in Dale & Tucker vs. Evil.

Welcome to Shrooms.

You will find nothing new in Shrooms and, were I to go on at length about what you would not find new, my review of Shrooms would probably itself be rather clich&eacute;.

But okay, fine, one quick paragraph to prove I really did kill 90 grueling minutes of my waning time on this sorry-ass planet watching the movie. College kids vacationing in a remote location - this time, hey, Ireland! They do something transgressive thing they shouldn't- in this case those wild Irish shrooms Ireland is so famous for! (And most of them end up doing their shrooms before the agreed-upon time, natch.) Nearby there's an urban haunted legend asylum torture house building where something anniversary killing crazy nastiness lurking evil happened once upon a time ago. For some reason eating shrooms is supposed to make the horror badness demonic hellspawn of not-niceness return in full force. There's a dumb frat boy, a virginal-ish pretty one, the dude who knows the ghost stories, some gibbering backwoods inbred yeehaws (albeit in this case Irish gibbering backwood yeehaws) who exist for no other reason than to be gibbering backwoods inbred yeehaws and some kids who have sex and are therefore offed first by the specter of the creeping shroomy hooded boogieman maniacal slayer ghost thing.

On the plus side, there's some decent camerawork and special effects, some good images that might even be iconic in a better movie. The stars are pretty to look at and might even be decent actors if this were a decent film. The filmmakers obviously got some funding from somewhere, somehow. Who they lied to in order to get that money, I have no idea.

Anything else to say that's positive? It has a talking cow. I guess there's that. The talking cow even delivers an awesome line - but the line is only awesome because it's, you know, delivered by a talking cow.

The ending. It kind of negates everything above, but really it doesn't because by that point, who cares. The movie's been so illogical - and not in the druggy, psychedelic way one might hope for, given the title - that the twist half of the viewers will see coming is really the only logical thing. Even though it's not logical at all - the plot holes are bigger than any of the wounds suffered by the victims of the stalker killer badguy creeper doombringer serial murderer.

Now here's a list of all the drug puns I intentionally left out of my review of Shrooms thus far.

Because to include them would have been adolescent of me.

Which is about the mindset you would need to enjoy this movie.

What I'm saying is, you would have to be on drugs to like Shrooms. Shrooms will damage your brain. You will never look at life the same way after Shrooms. Shrooms is a bad trip. You wouldn't like Shrooms even if you were on shrooms. The makers of this movie must have been on shrooms to think their script was any good. I ain't even getting started, but that's more than enough. Okay, a few more: The only thing getting wasted was my time. This movie's enough to make me do drugs. Cultivating a heroin or meth or crack habit might have been a smarter use of my time than doing Shrooms.",1376006400,,3505,4.628019323671498

3080330,3,B00127RAKI,"Five young people travel across the Atlantic Ocean hoping for a fabulous trip.  However, they encounter terrors they never previously imagined.

Definitely a fast paced action packed thrill ride until the end.  In the beginning, there was a romance or near romance that was partially introduced, which left that portion of the story falling flat.  Either due to poor editing or writing, certain comments or conversations seemed awkward at points.

If not for the ending, the other negatives could have been overlooked.  Content wise, the ending could fit.  The acting did falter some.  However, at the ending suddenly it felt as if the whole movie was no longer a horror movie with a side of the dangers of drugs moral but just focusing on morality.  Perhaps with a less explicit ending, it would have been easier.",1366588800,,814,4.926470588235294
3080331,2,B00127RAKI,"Waste of time. This movie takes the stereotypical ""young people making bad decisions in terrifying circumstances"" to the Nth degree!

3080333,3,B00127RAKI,"I decided to watch this movie because it seemed interesting. It was not the worst psychological thriller I've ever seen, but it was also not the best by far.

3080369,1,B00127RAKI,"SPOILERS!!!

Yet another one of those movies that ends with a ""twist"" where the main character has had a psychotic break with reality and is the killer all along. Honestly, it doesn't matter if the rest of the movie has been any good leading up to that because that ending just ruins the rest of the movie for me. At this point, it's probably tied with ""It was all a dream!"" for worst twist ending. I really wish screenwriters would stop falling back on this clich. Take a cue from David Lynch; if weird stuff is happening, just leave it at that. I'm sure more people than just me will respect you for it.",1337126400,,605,4.307017543859649

3080371,3,B00127RAKI,"I just finished watching ""Shrooms"" and was not as excited as I thought I would be. There is little gore, hardly any gory scenes that pop into my mind. This was just a typical slasher movie with no imagination on the kills. Everything was typical for a horror film nothing new or exciting to bring to this film. It has your typical 20 somethings doing drugs in the woods. There's inbreed woodsmen and good looking girls who keep there cloth on through the whole film. Now that was the only thing different there really was no sex scenes that are typical in these type horror films. I'm not saying all horror movies need sex scenes, It's just that this movie needed something to make it more interesting. I was bored toward the end and was already perdicting the ending which I got right. To bad I can't perdict the lotto like I do to many of these cookie cutter horror movies. I would rent this movie if you are into shroom infested hallucinations. If your looking for a good horror movie look elsewhere. Especially if you like gore and some originality.",1298764800,,1053,4.518324607329843
3080372,4,B00127RAKI,"It actually took me awhile to finally watch shrooms even though i had the movie for a few months, from the previews i thought it looked pretty good but never got around to i suppose. Well finally last night i turned it on to see what was in store. Right off the bat i could tell it seemed interesting enough to hold my attention and the acting was actually very good. Basically the story was pretty basic, kids go out in search of shrooms to have a weekend of tripping out and have some fun, and thats it. Well turns out the story got a lot more complicated as it went along, so much so it was really confusing and a bit jumbled throughout the film. The main character who is a Johnny Depp look alike was a fine actor, and while i don't know the names of the other real actors the parts they played were quite good. He spins off a story of this very abusive dark teacher at a school who keep kids in line very violently, and spooks the group until they finally head off to bed for the night. Well before this they pick the shrooms and one girl picks one of the bad dark tipped kind which were said to give you premontions, and pretty much see anything bad or good that would happen. After here initial ""trip"" she finds out this is true and pretty much through the whole film sees various things happen that don't really make a whole lot of sense. If you pay attention very very closely it kind of does. So while its hard to follow it is very enjoyable. Actually what makes the film work is its undeniable creepy dark dreary forest atmosphere which is spooky in itself, let alone when your out of your element. So not to give to much away but throughout the film various people die, or do they? The end is someone like the film The Uninvited but perhaps even a bit more surprising and actually better. So while Shrooms won't win an awards from fans as the best horror flick out there it definitely has its place in the cult film classics and is just as good as some of the more popular scarey films out there today. So take a trip.",1264118400,,2030,4.207692307692308
3080373,4,B00127RAKI,"When Sid ponders a horror film set in Ireland automatically the mind goes to the Leprechaun series. It made us believe we'd found Ireland's #1 cause of death. Well our little friend the Leprechaun has some competition coming in the way of fungi. However these are not your average mushroom you'd find on a nice chicken marsala. These are magic mushrooms in their most potent form. And naturally when you're ingesting the world's most potent shrooms the best place to be is not on your couch in peace but a haunted forest.

We start out with a group of 5 as they take a trip to Ireland exclusively to camp out and eat some shrooms. They probably could've just done that in the states, but hey we're not asking questions. The main character Tara took the flight hoping she'd land her summer flame Jake to further things along. Jake lives in Ireland and set this whole trip up for them. He appears to be the world's ultimate authority on the shroom. After they get to the camp ground and set up shop Jake orders the crew not to eat the black tipped mushrooms which usually cause death or worse if you survive after eating it. It will bring on very dark visions and communications with spirit world. Yikes! Tara happened to trail off before she heard the warning and eats one of the black tip shrooms causing her to have some insane hallucinogenic visions. She begins to see the hooded ghost that lurks the woods and one bu one see's how all her friends will die. From here on out it's pretty choatic and creepy. You get a lot of trippy visions, some inbred hillbillies, and a talking cow. You really can't go wrong in any sense with a combo like that.

The film appears to get a bad rap from most reviewers but it's pretty good. The film has a very dark creepy vibe which is perfect for the whole shroom trip experience. It's not something you're going to be terrified while watching, but you will have a few jumps. Also the ending finishes up the flick with a very nice twist which is so rare to find in the horror of today. The real message this one shows is to keep you a** at home if you plan on trippin balls.",1242950400,5,2111,4.368956743002545
3080374,3,B00127RAKI,"""Shrooms"" is decent little horror movie with a good message.
The message is that brain altering drugs can cause some real problems to ones brain and sanity.  The psych wards are filled with people whose trips left them with multiple personalities. And many others suffer from this caused condition in silence.  I personally knew at least three people who had bad trips that turned them very violent, so this movie is grounded in reality far more than the average horror flick.  Although it's hard to relate to the main cast members traveling to Ireland and instead of seeing the many awesome sights the country has to offer; going off for a mushroom trip? What a waste of time!  So is there a dog boy hunting them down? or is it a hallucination that they all share?  You will have to see this competently acted movie to find out.  And you could do far worse than this movie ( at this budget).",1240790400,,892,4.509316770186335

Shrooms doesn't try to do anything new, but for its brisk running time, it manages to deliver some great atmosphere (thanks to the genuinely creepy Irish woods) and some surprisingly decent acting (the gorgeous Lindsey Haun is the lead screamer here, and Step Up 2's Robert Hoffman is here as the over-sexed jock) to boot.  Where Shrooms disappoints is in terms of its gore, of which the film actually comes up pretty light.  What little blood there is is fairly done, but gorehounds and slasher addicts will be disappointed.  Still, there manages to be some good psychidelic film tricks, and a twist ending that you'll either dig or hate, depending on your degree of jadedness with the genre.  All in all, Shrooms isn't a bad trip (seriously, no pun intended), and is worth checking out for slasher fans.",1225929600,,978,4.757396449704142

I really enjoyed this film, I thought it had a great story line, cool characters, and A Grand Finaly of anending. Almost seem's like it should have been an M. Night film. (what a twist)
It was refreshing to watch a modern horror movie that was not a let down for a change. Horror/Suspence movies these days, Suck! But this a Great Film.",1225411200,,461,4.191011235955056
3080408,3,B00127RAKI,"Six attractive twenty-somethings decide to visit Ireland for a weekend of drug-induced fun.  During the first day of foraging, Tara accidentally ingests a bad mushroom and does not get bigger or get an extra life; she's a heroine on heroin.  She makes the same mistake as the guy from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Into-the-Wild/dp/B000ZN802W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Into the Wild</a>: she ate something bad.  Hey, Vanilla Ice tried to warn her; it's a poisonous mushroom.  She bit into a ""Death's Head Fungi"", a heart-exploding portal to another dimension that is purported to cause uncontrollable ferocity, and the ability of premonition and communication with the dead.  How was she supposed to know?  What's the difference between the bad one and the good one?  A black dot.  Good luck finding the speck after you've already taken hits that have you thinking you're a badger who can see singing snakes.

After the hallucinations begin, Jake tells the story of a sadistic monk who terrorized and beat children.  A few feral kids didn't like his brutal ways, and decided to get back at him by putting a bunch of Death's Head mushrooms into his soup.  The result, of course, was a homicidal maniac who executed everyone in sight.  Undeterred by the story, the rest get higher than a kite.  Soon thereafter, people go missing and the viewer doesn't know where to separate reality from insanity.  Keeping with horror movie tradition, while being chased by silhouettes in the forest the kids continue tripping.  Two characters get hit in the head with rocks - stoned.  Ba-dum-cha!

As for the characters, I'd say one ""actor"" udders the best line of the entire film: ""You know you're fu*#ed.  Dead fu*&ed.""  It's hilariously unnecessary, and foreshadowing for a movie that's easier to predict than a sunrise.

Overall, this movie is a bit half-baked.  The actors are somewhat convincing in their terror, but the visions seemed too similar to ""The Ring"" for my tastes.  Although, there were definite hallucinations and paranoia happening.  At one point I could swear I saw some massive cleavage and good acting.  Oh, wait, I saw both.  It's worthwhile for some interesting visuals and a fresh angle, but it's not ground-breaking by any means.",1224115200,10,2286,5.248618784530387

There are constant jump-out-of-your seat moments, the filming was done with tact, and it was easy to see a lot of thought was put behind it in order to create a claustrophobic atmosphere out of doors. That isn't the easiest thing to do. I found myself wondering what was to the left or the right of the camera many times and being frustrated that I couldn't. The suspense was entrancing and the story addicting. For an obvious low-budget flick, this one gives every penny's worth. Lindsey Haun was just as good here as she was in a much more subtle role in ""Broken Bridges."" Don't miss it. If you have a pension for horror, this one will not let down.

And I don't usually like that genre.  This one adds the psychedelic element that the group eats mushrooms and drinks mushroom tea.  The mix of whether things are real or not, especially the shimmering effects in the woods, are quite well done.  The cinematography is what kept me watching through the weaker story moments.  I'm not sure I like the violence meme the film's plot seems to attribute to a particular super-strength mushroom, but again this is fiction.  You will have to suspend some of your disbelief in regards to the tripping elements - those in the know will know it is not quite like portrayed.  That said, its worth watching and stands out for an indie horror film.",1212969600,,855,4.736486486486487

Well, I approve of making a movie about how good magic mushrooms are, and there's a scene with aforementioned cow that is so incongruous with the rest of this movie, I don't know what to say. Because this is supposed to be a very sombre, serious horror movie, and then thirty seconds of comedy?

Basic-slasher in the woods garbage. Dumb kids take mushrooms, and are killed by their hallucinatory monsters. Turns out one of them has taken a death's head mushroom, and begins to foresee dumb kids' deaths. Trouble is, these mushrooms also make you want to kill people, so she kills everyone while they are tripping, and the dumb kids are thinking that a ghost from the druidic era is wasting them. It's not, it's the girl, who is a fifth wheel at this little tripfest they're on, and she hates the jock, she hates the fashionista, she's pissed at the guy who she has a crush on, etc. There, I spoiled it, because no one should see this trash.

At times whacky and crazy, over the top and sometimes unbelievable and bit weird, it wasn't the best horror movie I've seen in a while but I enjoyed it for what it had to offer. Basically a group of friends takes a trip to Ireland where they are meeting up with some guy named Jake that has bespelled Tara, our heroine. Their whole purpose of going there is to take magic mushrooms and have an experience while camping out in the middle of dark, scary woods. Everything is going all right until they settle by the camp fire and the guide spills the beans about an abandoned orphanage where mysterious hooded monks tortured bad kids and how the grounds are still haunted. Not exactly a place one wants to be with no cell phones, help out of the way, crazies living in the woods in hand made shacks and while intoxicated on fungus of all things.

The fun part of the movie was watching the mood decline and the chill take over. The haunting and the scary stores suddenly don't seem so made up anymore and when intoxicated from taking the wrong mushroom, Tara starts to see the future; her visions are nothing short of dark and horrific. At the end it's a lot of running around, screaming, trying to escape the wrath of the mysterious black shape that is keen on having them meet the maker and trying to figure out what is real and what is simply the worst trip of their whole lives. Are people dying or is it all in their imagination, you won't know until the end! There is gore and blood and strange disturbing things, but I won't spoil them, it was more fun watching it all unravel on my own.

I liked the ending; it came to a stunning conclusion although it did remind me of a certain French film I saw last year, overall not bad and mildly entertaining for a rainy afternoon. I had my likes and dislikes about it but I'm glad I got to see it.

3080414,3,B00127RAKI,"This was a well done suspenseful horror flick with a unique twist -- everyone is trippin' dey balls off -- which adds considerable tension as you cannot tell what's real and what's hallucinatory, nor can the characters.  Indeed, several scenes play out entirely in a character's head as she's convulsing helplessly on the ground rather than participating in said scenes.

*SPOILER ALERT*

Okay, as for ""foreshadowing"" I pretty much knew who the killer was BEFORE the first killing -- it was plainly stated that the non-existant ""Death Cap"" (which looks EXACTLY like the other shrooms except for a black tip at the end -- and they allegedly only pop up every few years) is highly toxic, and if you live through the initial shock the ""ancient druids claimed eaters would experience precognition, out of body experiences, interact with spirits, and experience UNCONTROLLABLE FITS OF EXTREME VIOLENCE.  And, while they're collecting shrooms for the brew, guess who decides to pop a Death Cap in their mouth not knowing what it is?  That's right . . . and guess who later experiences the effects of ""precognition, OOBE, and talking with spirits).  Yep . . . not much of a stretch to assume she might also be having the aforementioned UNCONTROLLABLE FITS OF EXTREME VIOLENCE?  Hmmmmm . . . and if that's not enough foreshadowing, halfway through the story we're told a tale of the evil ""Black Brother"" who, after being dosed with Death Caps went on a mass killing spree.  So, unless yer on shrooms yourself it's pretty obvious who the killer is right away.  Still, it's a suspenseful and well done thriller.

Regardless, I might've even felt compelled to give this film 5 stars if it wasn't for 2 negative elements:
1.) The unlikeable steroid swilling jock, ""Bluto"", was a stereotypical charicature -- even his name.  However, the actor did a good job with his assigned part -- especially after consuming 10 doses of shroom tea.
2.) The very ending, as the last survivor is rescued and being driven away in the ambulance, still not knowing she's the killer -- and then a cellphone rings and she has a flashback of committing every homicide.  If they'd left it like that, with her either feeling remorse or fear or delight then ended it like that with her, the killer, being an assumed victim, it would've been an outstanding ending.  But no -- the ending they chose, as well as both alternate endings are nearly identical in which the girl murders the paramedic and escapes into the woods.  Stupid, stupid, stupid . . . could've been a classic, but someone had to turn it into a cliche.  3.5 stars.",1208995200,,2592,4.780269058295964

I say absurd because throughout the movie there will be times when you'll find yourself wondering whether or not the filmmakers ever actually had any real prior experience with Hallucinogens, let's just say that it has it's unrealistc moments. Do not let that last comment stare you away from adding this one to your collection though.

3080416,4,B00127RAKI,"I have seen nothing but derogatory comments about this film, but I found Shrooms to be a pretty fun little horror movie.  Sure, you don't have to have eaten a Deaths Head mushroom to see prophetic visions of how the film will end, and the story doesn't exactly break new ground in terms of character development, but Shrooms does have a suspenseful moment or two and I happen to believe that the look and feel of the film (which some have decried as hopelessly bland) creates the appropriate atmosphere for the setting and the events that take place there.  It's Ireland, people, not the bright and sunny beaches of Rio de Janeiro.

Forget about the whole potato business.  Apparently, Ireland is all about psychedelic mushrooms.  In the film, five dumb Americans have just spent tons of money to fly across the Atlantic in order to camp out deep in the woods and indulge in the hallucinogenic visions wrought by the local ""magic mushrooms.""  Well, one of them, Tara (Lindsey Haun, who happens to bear a strong resemblance to Kirsten Dunst) came in hopes of hooking up with host Jake (Jack Huston); her four annoying friends (two stuck-up girls and their annoying boyfriends, one of whom looks like the skinny guy from Jay and Silent Bob while the other one is dumb frat boy material) tagged along for the psychedelic adventure.

Already bummed over the fact that Jake isn't paying her much attention, Tara decides to eat one of the mushrooms she finds - unfortunately, it's a Deaths Head mushroom.  Supposedly, anyone who eats one of these particular shrooms - assuming he/she actually survives - gains several dark attributes, such as the ability to predict the future.  Being the main character in the film, Tara naturally survives, waking up in time to hear Jake tell the others about the dark monk who terrorized and murdered a number of the kids under his charge, including a shrouded boy who poisoned him, and is said to still roam those very woods looking to kill those who would enter his domain.  As you can probably guess, Tara soon begins having terrifying premonitions of her friends' violent deaths - just before those deaths actually happen.  Soon all of the characters are scrambling around the woods in search of help and answers as they are picked off one by one.  Tara begins seeing the dark monk seemingly stalking her, the boy in the shroud pops up a time or two, and a family of inbred hillbillies stops by to make things even more interesting.

There are some obvious parallels between Shrooms and another recent film which shall remain nameless; I only mention this because I raked that other movie over the coals for the absurdity of its ending and, in retrospect, overall approach to the entire story.  A case can certainly be made that Shrooms borrows heavily from this other film - yet here, the story actually works reasonably well (aside from its predictability and lack of originality).  With the characters all befuddling their minds with psychedelic mushroom delights, one can never be sure if what you are seeing is real or a hallucination.  With so much wriggle room to work with, Shrooms actually turns out to be a pretty effective little horror movie, in my opinion.

3314823,1,B00127RAKI,"I frankly don't care what chemicals responsible adults put into their bodies, so if you psilocybin's your thing, hey, have a great trip, but don't do Shrooms, the horror movie.

Some horror movies are just so by rote that all you really need to say about them is they contain every clich&eacute; parodied so successfully in Dale & Tucker vs. Evil.

Welcome to Shrooms.

You will find nothing new in Shrooms and, were I to go on at length about what you would not find new, my review of Shrooms would probably itself be rather clich&eacute;.

But okay, fine, one quick paragraph to prove I really did kill 90 grueling minutes of my waning time on this sorry-ass planet watching the movie. College kids vacationing in a remote location - this time, hey, Ireland! They do something transgressive thing they shouldn't- in this case those wild Irish shrooms Ireland is so famous for! (And most of them end up doing their shrooms before the agreed-upon time, natch.) Nearby there's an urban haunted legend asylum torture house building where something anniversary killing crazy nastiness lurking evil happened once upon a time ago. For some reason eating shrooms is supposed to make the horror badness demonic hellspawn of not-niceness return in full force. There's a dumb frat boy, a virginal-ish pretty one, the dude who knows the ghost stories, some gibbering backwoods inbred yeehaws (albeit in this case Irish gibbering backwood yeehaws) who exist for no other reason than to be gibbering backwoods inbred yeehaws and some kids who have sex and are therefore offed first by the specter of the creeping shroomy hooded boogieman maniacal slayer ghost thing.

On the plus side, there's some decent camerawork and special effects, some good images that might even be iconic in a better movie. The stars are pretty to look at and might even be decent actors if this were a decent film. The filmmakers obviously got some funding from somewhere, somehow. Who they lied to in order to get that money, I have no idea.

Anything else to say that's positive? It has a talking cow. I guess there's that. The talking cow even delivers an awesome line - but the line is only awesome because it's, you know, delivered by a talking cow.

The ending. It kind of negates everything above, but really it doesn't because by that point, who cares. The movie's been so illogical - and not in the druggy, psychedelic way one might hope for, given the title - that the twist half of the viewers will see coming is really the only logical thing. Even though it's not logical at all - the plot holes are bigger than any of the wounds suffered by the victims of the stalker killer badguy creeper doombringer serial murderer.

Now here's a list of all the drug puns I intentionally left out of my review of Shrooms thus far.

Because to include them would have been adolescent of me.

Which is about the mindset you would need to enjoy this movie.

What I'm saying is, you would have to be on drugs to like Shrooms. Shrooms will damage your brain. You will never look at life the same way after Shrooms. Shrooms is a bad trip. You wouldn't like Shrooms even if you were on shrooms. The makers of this movie must have been on shrooms to think their script was any good. I ain't even getting started, but that's more than enough. Okay, a few more: The only thing getting wasted was my time. This movie's enough to make me do drugs. Cultivating a heroin or meth or crack habit might have been a smarter use of my time than doing Shrooms.",1376006400,,3505,4.628019323671498

Well finally last night i turned it on to see what was in store. Right off the bat i could tell it seemed interesting enough to hold my attention and the acting was actually very good. Basically the story was pretty basic, kids go out in search of shrooms to have a weekend of tripping out and have some fun, and thats it. Well turns out the story got a lot more complicated as it went along, so much so it was really confusing and a bit jumbled throughout the film. The main character who is a Johnny Depp look alike was a fine actor, and while i don't know the names of the other real actors the parts they played were quite good. He spins off a story of this very abusive dark teacher at a school who keep kids in line very violently, and spooks the group until they finally head off to bed for the night. Well before this they pick the shrooms and one girl picks one of the bad dark tipped kind which were said to give you premontions, and pretty much see anything bad or good that would happen. After here initial ""trip"" she finds out this is true and pretty much through the whole film sees various things happen that don't really make a whole lot of sense. If you pay attention very very closely it kind of does. So while its hard to follow it is very enjoyable. Actually what makes the film work is its undeniable creepy dark dreary forest atmosphere which is spooky in itself, let alone when your out of your element. So not to give to much away but throughout the film various people die, or do they? The end is someone like the film The Uninvited but perhaps even a bit more surprising and actually better. So while Shrooms won't win an awards from fans as the best horror flick out there it definitely has its place in the cult film classics and is just as good as some of the more popular scarey films out there today.

3314870,4,B00127RAKI,"When Sid ponders a horror film set in Ireland automatically the mind goes to the Leprechaun series. It made us believe we'd found Ireland's #1 cause of death. Well our little friend the Leprechaun has some competition coming in the way of fungi. However these are not your average mushroom you'd find on a nice chicken marsala. These are magic mushrooms in their most potent form. And naturally when you're ingesting the world's most potent shrooms the best place to be is not on your couch in peace but a haunted forest.

We start out with a group of 5 as they take a trip to Ireland exclusively to camp out and eat some shrooms. They probably could've just done that in the states, but hey we're not asking questions. The main character Tara took the flight hoping she'd land her summer flame Jake to further things along. Jake lives in Ireland and set this whole trip up for them. He appears to be the world's ultimate authority on the shroom. After they get to the camp ground and set up shop Jake orders the crew not to eat the black tipped mushrooms which usually cause death or worse if you survive after eating it. It will bring on very dark visions and communications with spirit world. Yikes! Tara happened to trail off before she heard the warning and eats one of the black tip shrooms causing her to have some insane hallucinogenic visions. She begins to see the hooded ghost that lurks the woods and one bu one see's how all her friends will die. From here on out it's pretty choatic and creepy. You get a lot of trippy visions, some inbred hillbillies, and a talking cow. You really can't go wrong in any sense with a combo like that.

The film appears to get a bad rap from most reviewers but it's pretty good. The film has a very dark creepy vibe which is perfect for the whole shroom trip experience. It's not something you're going to be terrified while watching, but you will have a few jumps.

The message is that brain altering drugs can cause some real problems to ones brain and sanity.  The psych wards are filled with people whose trips left them with multiple personalities. And many others suffer from this caused condition in silence.  I personally knew at least three people who had bad trips that turned them very violent, so this movie is grounded in reality far more than the average horror flick.  Although it's hard to relate to the main cast members traveling to Ireland and instead of seeing the many awesome sights the country has to offer; going off for a mushroom trip?

3314873,3,B00127RAKI,"What happens when a group of college kids take a trip to Ireland to partake in some psychidelic mushroom eating?  They get slashed to bits by an insane killer that's what!  Shrooms doesn't try to do anything new, but for its brisk running time, it manages to deliver some great atmosphere (thanks to the genuinely creepy Irish woods) and some surprisingly decent acting (the gorgeous Lindsey Haun is the lead screamer here, and Step Up 2's Robert Hoffman is here as the over-sexed jock) to boot.  Where Shrooms disappoints is in terms of its gore, of which the film actually comes up pretty light.  What little blood there is is fairly done, but gorehounds and slasher addicts will be disappointed.  Still, there manages to be some good psychidelic film tricks, and a twist ending that you'll either dig or hate, depending on your degree of jadedness with the genre.  All in all, Shrooms isn't a bad trip (seriously, no pun intended), and is worth checking out for slasher fans.",1225929600,,978,4.757396449704142

3314905,3,B00127RAKI,"Six attractive twenty-somethings decide to visit Ireland for a weekend of drug-induced fun.  During the first day of foraging, Tara accidentally ingests a bad mushroom and does not get bigger or get an extra life; she's a heroine on heroin.  She makes the same mistake as the guy from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Into-the-Wild/dp/B000ZN802W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Into the Wild</a>: she ate something bad.  Hey, Vanilla Ice tried to warn her; it's a poisonous mushroom.  She bit into a ""Death's Head Fungi"", a heart-exploding portal to another dimension that is purported to cause uncontrollable ferocity, and the ability of premonition and communication with the dead.  How was she supposed to know?  What's the difference between the bad one and the good one?  A black dot.  Good luck finding the speck after you've already taken hits that have you thinking you're a badger who can see singing snakes.

After the hallucinations begin, Jake tells the story of a sadistic monk who terrorized and beat children.  A few feral kids didn't like his brutal ways, and decided to get back at him by putting a bunch of Death's Head mushrooms into his soup.  The result, of course, was a homicidal maniac who executed everyone in sight.  Undeterred by the story, the rest get higher than a kite.  Soon thereafter, people go missing and the viewer doesn't know where to separate reality from insanity.  Keeping with horror movie tradition, while being chased by silhouettes in the forest the kids continue tripping.  Two characters get hit in the head with rocks - stoned.  Ba-dum-cha!

As for the characters, I'd say one ""actor"" udders the best line of the entire film: ""You know you're fu*#ed.  Dead fu*&ed.""  It's hilariously unnecessary, and foreshadowing for a movie that's easier to predict than a sunrise.

Overall, this movie is a bit half-baked.  The actors are somewhat convincing in their terror, but the visions seemed too similar to ""The Ring"" for my tastes.  Although, there were definite hallucinations and paranoia happening.  At one point I could swear I saw some massive cleavage and good acting.  Oh, wait, I saw both.  It's worthwhile for some interesting visuals and a fresh angle, but it's not ground-breaking by any means.",1224115200,10,2286,5.248618784530387
3314906,5,B00127RAKI,"Man, I don't know what all these bad reviews are all about. If you want to talk about garbage, watch ""Haunted Boat."" This movie blows doors over that rubbish. There are constant jump-out-of-your seat moments, the filming was done with tact, and it was easy to see a lot of thought was put behind it in order to create a claustrophobic atmosphere out of doors. That isn't the easiest thing to do. I found myself wondering what was to the left or the right of the camera many times and being frustrated that I couldn't. The suspense was entrancing and the story addicting. For an obvious low-budget flick, this one gives every penny's worth. Lindsey Haun was just as good here as she was in a much more subtle role in ""Broken Bridges."" Don't miss it. If you have a pension for horror, this one will not let down.
One more thing: The twist-ending was a bit predictable but still done very well.",1222387200,4,891,4.47239263803681
3314907,3,B00127RAKI,"I enjoyed this film; it was decent light entertainment for the suspend-your-disbelief ""young people go out to the woods and are killed off one by one"" slasher film genre.  And I don't usually like that genre.  This one adds the psychedelic element that the group eats mushrooms and drinks mushroom tea.  The mix of whether things are real or not, especially the shimmering effects in the woods, are quite well done.  The cinematography is what kept me watching through the weaker story moments.  I'm not sure I like the violence meme the film's plot seems to attribute to a particular super-strength mushroom, but again this is fiction.  You will have to suspend some of your disbelief in regards to the tripping elements - those in the know will know it is not quite like portrayed.  That said, its worth watching and stands out for an indie horror film.",1212969600,,855,4.736486486486487

Well, I approve of making a movie about how good magic mushrooms are, and there's a scene with aforementioned cow that is so incongruous with the rest of this movie, I don't know what to say. Because this is supposed to be a very sombre, serious horror movie, and then thirty seconds of comedy?

Basic-slasher in the woods garbage. Dumb kids take mushrooms, and are killed by their hallucinatory monsters. Turns out one of them has taken a death's head mushroom, and begins to foresee dumb kids' deaths. Trouble is, these mushrooms also make you want to kill people, so she kills everyone while they are tripping, and the dumb kids are thinking that a ghost from the druidic era is wasting them. It's not, it's the girl, who is a fifth wheel at this little tripfest they're on, and she hates the jock, she hates the fashionista, she's pissed at the guy who she has a crush on, etc. There, I spoiled it, because no one should see this trash.

3314909,3,B00127RAKI,"This was an interesting little morsel of gore and ickiness. At times whacky and crazy, over the top and sometimes unbelievable and bit weird, it wasn't the best horror movie I've seen in a while but I enjoyed it for what it had to offer. Basically a group of friends takes a trip to Ireland where they are meeting up with some guy named Jake that has bespelled Tara, our heroine. Their whole purpose of going there is to take magic mushrooms and have an experience while camping out in the middle of dark, scary woods. Everything is going all right until they settle by the camp fire and the guide spills the beans about an abandoned orphanage where mysterious hooded monks tortured bad kids and how the grounds are still haunted. Not exactly a place one wants to be with no cell phones, help out of the way, crazies living in the woods in hand made shacks and while intoxicated on fungus of all things.

The fun part of the movie was watching the mood decline and the chill take over. The haunting and the scary stores suddenly don't seem so made up anymore and when intoxicated from taking the wrong mushroom, Tara starts to see the future; her visions are nothing short of dark and horrific. At the end it's a lot of running around, screaming, trying to escape the wrath of the mysterious black shape that is keen on having them meet the maker and trying to figure out what is real and what is simply the worst trip of their whole lives. Are people dying or is it all in their imagination, you won't know until the end! There is gore and blood and strange disturbing things, but I won't spoil them, it was more fun watching it all unravel on my own.

I liked the ending; it came to a stunning conclusion although it did remind me of a certain French film I saw last year, overall not bad and mildly entertaining for a rainy afternoon. I had my likes and dislikes about it but I'm glad I got to see it.

3314911,3,B00127RAKI,"This was a well done suspenseful horror flick with a unique twist -- everyone is trippin' dey balls off -- which adds considerable tension as you cannot tell what's real and what's hallucinatory, nor can the characters.  Indeed, several scenes play out entirely in a character's head as she's convulsing helplessly on the ground rather than participating in said scenes.

*SPOILER ALERT*

Okay, as for ""foreshadowing"" I pretty much knew who the killer was BEFORE the first killing -- it was plainly stated that the non-existant ""Death Cap"" (which looks EXACTLY like the other shrooms except for a black tip at the end -- and they allegedly only pop up every few years) is highly toxic, and if you live through the initial shock the ""ancient druids claimed eaters would experience precognition, out of body experiences, interact with spirits, and experience UNCONTROLLABLE FITS OF EXTREME VIOLENCE.  And, while they're collecting shrooms for the brew, guess who decides to pop a Death Cap in their mouth not knowing what it is?  That's right . . . and guess who later experiences the effects of ""precognition, OOBE, and talking with spirits).  Yep . . . not much of a stretch to assume she might also be having the aforementioned UNCONTROLLABLE FITS OF EXTREME VIOLENCE?  Hmmmmm . . . and if that's not enough foreshadowing, halfway through the story we're told a tale of the evil ""Black Brother"" who, after being dosed with Death Caps went on a mass killing spree.  So, unless yer on shrooms yourself it's pretty obvious who the killer is right away.  Still, it's a suspenseful and well done thriller.

Regardless, I might've even felt compelled to give this film 5 stars if it wasn't for 2 negative elements:
1.) The unlikeable steroid swilling jock, ""Bluto"", was a stereotypical charicature -- even his name.  However, the actor did a good job with his assigned part -- especially after consuming 10 doses of shroom tea.
2.) The very ending, as the last survivor is rescued and being driven away in the ambulance, still not knowing she's the killer -- and then a cellphone rings and she has a flashback of committing every homicide.  If they'd left it like that, with her either feeling remorse or fear or delight then ended it like that with her, the killer, being an assumed victim, it would've been an outstanding ending.  But no -- the ending they chose, as well as both alternate endings are nearly identical in which the girl murders the paramedic and escapes into the woods.  Stupid, stupid, stupid . . . could've been a classic, but someone had to turn it into a cliche.  3.5 stars.",1208995200,,2592,4.780269058295964
3314912,4,B00127RAKI,"I'm just a dumb horror film fan so you might not want to take my word for it but I think ""Shrooms"" is a very solid horror movie. It's original, but not so original (if you know what I mean), a little predictable and absurd but it's loaded with atmosphere, plenty of frightening visuals and jumpy scares. I say absurd because throughout the movie there will be times when you'll find yourself wondering whether or not the filmmakers ever actually had any real prior experience with Hallucinogens, let's just say that it has it's unrealistc moments. Do not let that last comment stare you away from adding this one to your collection though.

3314913,4,B00127RAKI,"I have seen nothing but derogatory comments about this film, but I found Shrooms to be a pretty fun little horror movie.  Sure, you don't have to have eaten a Deaths Head mushroom to see prophetic visions of how the film will end, and the story doesn't exactly break new ground in terms of character development, but Shrooms does have a suspenseful moment or two and I happen to believe that the look and feel of the film (which some have decried as hopelessly bland) creates the appropriate atmosphere for the setting and the events that take place there.  It's Ireland, people, not the bright and sunny beaches of Rio de Janeiro.

Forget about the whole potato business.  Apparently, Ireland is all about psychedelic mushrooms.  In the film, five dumb Americans have just spent tons of money to fly across the Atlantic in order to camp out deep in the woods and indulge in the hallucinogenic visions wrought by the local ""magic mushrooms.""  Well, one of them, Tara (Lindsey Haun, who happens to bear a strong resemblance to Kirsten Dunst) came in hopes of hooking up with host Jake (Jack Huston); her four annoying friends (two stuck-up girls and their annoying boyfriends, one of whom looks like the skinny guy from Jay and Silent Bob while the other one is dumb frat boy material) tagged along for the psychedelic adventure.

Already bummed over the fact that Jake isn't paying her much attention, Tara decides to eat one of the mushrooms she finds - unfortunately, it's a Deaths Head mushroom.  Supposedly, anyone who eats one of these particular shrooms - assuming he/she actually survives - gains several dark attributes, such as the ability to predict the future.  Being the main character in the film, Tara naturally survives, waking up in time to hear Jake tell the others about the dark monk who terrorized and murdered a number of the kids under his charge, including a shrouded boy who poisoned him, and is said to still roam those very woods looking to kill those who would enter his domain.  As you can probably guess, Tara soon begins having terrifying premonitions of her friends' violent deaths - just before those deaths actually happen.  Soon all of the characters are scrambling around the woods in search of help and answers as they are picked off one by one.  Tara begins seeing the dark monk seemingly stalking her, the boy in the shroud pops up a time or two, and a family of inbred hillbillies stops by to make things even more interesting.

There are some obvious parallels between Shrooms and another recent film which shall remain nameless; I only mention this because I raked that other movie over the coals for the absurdity of its ending and, in retrospect, overall approach to the entire story.  A case can certainly be made that Shrooms borrows heavily from this other film - yet here, the story actually works reasonably well (aside from its predictability and lack of originality).  With the characters all befuddling their minds with psychedelic mushroom delights, one can never be sure if what you are seeing is real or a hallucination.  With so much wriggle room to work with, Shrooms actually turns out to be a pretty effective little horror movie, in my opinion.

All the actors did a great job under what had to be some very trying circumstances; they were wet and muddy a great deal of the time.  The herky jerky and bizarre camera angles were just enough, not overdone and played well for a drug fueled dream.  The plot twist on the ending was a bit silly, but nevertheless I didn't see it coming.  The reason it has four stars instead of five was because this movie also had one of my pet peeves, scenes shot in the dark.  Guys, you who make movies, do you understand why Friday the 13th was such a smash hit?
