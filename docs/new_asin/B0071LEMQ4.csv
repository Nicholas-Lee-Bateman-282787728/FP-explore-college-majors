5048774,5,B0071LEMQ4,Not only was this Anime good in Japanese but the English Dub version is superb! Yes its true its one of those Animes where the guy falls in love with the girl but the girl refuses him and trys to deny her growing feelings for him but the way that it is told is by far the most unique part of this Anime. Ive seen many Animes in every single genre and this Anime was one of the few that left a strong impression on me.,1334620800,,417,3.86046511627907
5048775,2,B0071LEMQ4,"TL:DR version first off:

Pros: the narrator is funny, the animation is good and the main guy does have some charm

Cons: the female lead is vicious, the plot is all over the place, the tone is inconsistent and most of the major plot points are left unresolved.  Also Ryoko beats on Ryoshi like a red headed step child.

Ryoko is the Big Bad Wolf and she works for a school club called Otogi Bank that solves people's problems.  For a tough fighter with a hair trigger temper she sure does get kidnapped a lot.  Anyway, while out solving a problem one day she receives a love confession from the socially phobic Ryoshi, who can't stand to have people stare at him.  Hilarity ensues.  Ryoko and her room mate Little Red Riding Hood end up taking Ryoshi into their problem solving team so they can have all sorts of wacky adventures like participating in a beauty pageant, invading enemy high schools and confronting Ryoko's worst enemy.

Ryoko is one of those ""strong"" female characters who are tough on the outside but soft on the inside. While the show hints at why she's this way, she's not very well developed over all, and her violent nature does not help in making her sympathetic.  Also, she doesn't grow throughout the show, leaving it the way she came in.  As a result of this, one of the central aspects of the show, her relationship to Ryoshi, doesn't change from episode two through twelve much at all.  While some would say twelve episodes is too short to give a character much development, and admittedly Ryoko's got some huge issues to deal with, this nearly complete lack of change is disappointing and unsatisfying.  Part of that dissatisfaction comes from the fact that though a major figure from her past is the main antagonist, Ryoko herself has little agency in confronting and overcoming him.  Since his motivations are largely tied to her, as well, this is something of a flaw in the story telling and a huge missed opportunity to give Ryoko some much needed character growth.

Ryoshi is the wimpiest of wimpy guys, at least at first.  If Ryoko is supposed to be the Bid Bad Wolf, then Ryoshi is the huntsman, what with his stalking abilities and his weapon of choice, a slingshot.  Unlike Ryoko, he actually does develop over the course of the series, and this helps to make him a more sympathetic and interesting character.  While he starts the show with some mad slingshot skills, he also learns to fight and starts to face his phobia of being stared at, in the process becoming more willing to protect those close to him in a proactive way.  His phobia is played for laughs, and it usually works.  Like so very, VERY many anime protagonists before him, he is motivated by a need to protect his lady friend, and often shouts this in battle.  Why he does love her is something of a mystery given how Ryoko's main form of communication with him is a fist to the face. He's in  love with her tsundere charms, I guess, though all he gets is the tsun and non of the dere.  Though his dialogue toward the back half of the show devolves to ""I will protect Ryoko"" he remains a sympathetic and fairly likeable character.

As you might expect from a show that specifically mentions seven companions, there are a plethora of minor characters in this show as well.  Ringo (Little Red Riding Hood, what?), Ryoko's room mate and best friend, is the most important of the other Otogi Bank members.  As Ryoko's best friend, room mate and closest confidant, she also serves as Ryoko's humanizing element.  She's cute and childlike, brilliantly intelligent and pretty snarky, and actually pretty likeable, to boot.  She is also the lens through which we see most of Ryoko's character development, which all happens in flashback.

The rest of the bank is filled out with assorted character archetypes: the quiet president, the tech geek secretary, the mad scientist, the maid, the lady killer and his sex crazed girlfriend.  Some of them get their own episodes, namely the maid and the sex crazed girl friend.  They're all right but nothing to write home about.  We learn virtually nothing about half of them.

There is also a narrator to the story, and let me just say that she gets all the best lines.  A lot of what makes this show watchable is the narrator's monologue, and her continual commentary on the actions and characters in the show.  She also uses a lot of meta humor, with lines like ""in this episode"" and ""this isn't that kind of anime"" and so on.  She wins the show on likeability, and the English VA does a great job.  Pretty impressive for a character we never see.  She does occasionally talk over character dialogue, but I didn't find that too terrible since she generally only talked over arguments.

The main bad guy is so generic he's not really even worth mentioning.  A menacing white haired pretty boy, student council president of a rival school.  What makes him menacing to Ryoko is barely touched on, not explored at all.  And I'm not sure what fairy tale he's supposed to be, if any at all.  He's not even the huntsman who always seems to kill the big bad wolf, since that's established to be Ryoshi.

The main gimmick of the show are the fairy tale elements, and they are not well done.  In a time where this seems to be a trend, at least in American media, where remade fairy tales are a dime a dozen, and some of them are actually good (like Fables!) I guess there are bound to be a few duds.  The fairy tale elements here are very tacked on, mostly found in store and restaurant names, with a few token characters named after fairy tales.  The Cinderella spoof is the most effectively used fairy tale, and that's taken care of in the very first episode.  Don't expect the tales to have any real effect on story, theme or plot.

So what makes this show so boring and bland and disappointing?  There's a lot of good stuff here, honestly, but very little of it is used well.  Instead of building on a couple solid characters and story elements, they overreached and filled this up with too much stuff.  Twelve episodes is not enough time to dig deep into the themes and story elements they set up, especially when they stuffed way too much in there:  Eight characters deemed important with the title.  At least three traumatized childhoods exposed.  School rivalry.  The central romance (that goes no where).  The virtually untapped modern fairy tale groundwork.  All powerful student club.  In other words, WAY too much stuff for twelve episodes.

So over all, this was a disappointment, bland, and pretty generic.  Too much is introduced and nothing gets resolved. Half of the main duo is pretty terrible, and the fairy tale elements are underused.  It's just another mildly boring high school anime.",1334448000,12,6739,4.630691399662732
5048776,5,B0071LEMQ4,"Funimation in my opinion makes some of the best blu rays and uses the best voice actors ive heard. I cant think of many if any dubs that just don't work put out by Funimation and this show doesnt break that chain.

Presentation of the blu ray is great, it comes in in a very attractive box, although it is just two cases housing both the dvd versions of the show and the blu ray version. The menus are simple, effective, and responsive.

The voice acting is good, before I buy blu rays I often try to find some way to watch the first episode, none of the acting felt off or just wrong, of course if dubs aren't your thing then the original audio with subtitles are available.

I always advocate buying the official release if its a show that you liked, in this case you cant go wrong. Its a quality product.

now plot wise.... there are many different places to get reviews on it.",1334448000,,880,4.251497005988024
5048777,5,B0071LEMQ4,"This is an anime of a style that has been rare in recent years.  It's a romantic comedy, without a harem.  The story's pretty simple.  Boy likes girl.  Actually the boy is completely devoted to the girl and has no problem being open with his feelings once he gains the courage to actually talk to her.  He does have a problem being the center of attention.  He has a fear of being stared at.  This is a problem because the girl is a fighter and values strength.  A boy that can't even stand to be watched for seconds isn't very appealing.  She's also very closed off from her emotions, so even if she did eventually have feelings for the boy, getting her to admit it, even to herself, would take time.

The girl's part of a high school club that does favors for people in return for favors at some future date.  Sometimes these favors require violence to complete.  That's when the girl's boxing skills come to play.  Many of the episodes of this anime are mini stories based on the club's client of the day or to further develop the story of one of the club members.  These are usually just silly or emotionally positive side stories that finish by the end of the episode.  There are a few exceptions and these center around the anime's villain.  Besides that, the only main story line that carries throughout the anime is how the relationship between the boy and girl develops, or doesn't, through the episodes.

This is one of the better anime of its style that I've watched.  Though the story is unresolved by the end of the anime, it stops at a point in time where everyone is in a good place.  Hopefully there will be another anime following these same characters in the future.",1334275200,6,1684,4.444444444444445
5048778,3,B0071LEMQ4,"I'm not going to review the show itself, but rather the technical aspects of this release. The release comes on two BD cases each containing two discs. One case is for the DVD version, while the other one is for the BD version each with different artwork on the cover slip as well as in the reverse side.

Now for the video quality itself regarding the BD version, this is where it will leave you disappointed. While the show was very likely not created in HD, the BD version itself is nothing but a mere up-scaled. It looks almost identical to the DVD version in every aspect to the point where you almost can't tell the difference between the two. I played the DVD version using my BD player that does a fine job at up-scaling DVDs and of course I also played the BD version as well. After carefully comparing the two using the same scenes for reference, the difference is very subtle. While the text on the credits and subtitles look much cleaner on the BD version, everything else look almost the same as the DVD version. On the BD version there is still color-banding, minor artifacts, and lots of jaggy edges around the characters and backgrounds. It's like watching it on DVD with a nice upscaler. On the DVD version, it is a little bit more apparent. As for the color itself, the BD version has a slight edge on it, but on the DVD version it still looks fantastic. overall, both the BD version and DVD version are almost 1:1 identical in terms of video quality. So what about the audio presentation?

Before I continue on with the audio aspect of the show, I gotta say that the English Dub itself is actually good. While the English Dub is presented in 5.1 sound, the Japanese Dub is stuck with a 2.0 track and while both tracks sound great regardless, the audio for both came out soft. I have turn up the volume on my Onkyo receiver much higher than I usually do to actually hear anything at a audible level. Basically the audio quality is great, but came out soft. The 5.1 mix turn out good since it utilizes all the speakers well.

So is this release worth buying? If you like the show and don't care for HD quality, then yes. If you like the show and expect a nice HD presentation, then consider what I said first before making a final decision. If you never seen the show, I would recommend that you watch it first on Funimation's site (it's free) before buying.",1334102400,2,2375,4.405466970387244
5048779,5,B0071LEMQ4,"Only Japanese Dub ?

Does anyone one know this anime's speach language ?

Is Japanese only or JP EN both !????

5048780,5,B0071LEMQ4,"This series is adorable! I had heard about it being an alright series when it was out in Japan so I thought I would give it a shot and it was far better then I was expecting. The characters are all so cute, I love the art style and the show has tons of funny scenes to keep the viewers laughing while enjoying the plot. The series itself tries to mix up all the famous fairy tails all mixed into one anime series like Little Red Riding Hood, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Sleeping Beauty, The Rabbit and the Turtle, The Three Little Pigs, Hansel and Gretel, and many more. The main characters in the series are Ryouko Ookami playing the role of the big bad wolf, Ringo Akai playing the role of little red riding hood, and Ryoushi Morino playing the role of the hunter who hopelessly falls in love with the big bad wolf. Ringo and Ryoushi play Ryouko's two main sidekicks with Ryouko as the main heroine of the film, the other characters serve as supporting characters in a business that they work for called the Otogi Bank. The Otogi Bank is a student organization that grants favors to students on the condition that the favor would be returned someday. Some of the favors that they get asked to do include playing the role of matchmaker, beating up rival school gangs, and setting up some contest. As the story progresses we see that the main character Ryouko starts to open up to Ringo and Ryoushi more and the audience starts to learn more about why Ryouko was so afraid to let people become too close to her and why she didn't want anyone to find out more about her past. I wasn't completely satisfied with the ending because it leaves some things unresolved but I will be eagerly awaiting a second season if the creators decide to make one. The ending left me wanting to watch more of this great series, it was very entertaining to watch.

Pros
---------
- Awesome voice acting in English! all the characters are super cute and the voices go very well with the characters and the narration of the series.
- Very funny, cute and entertaining series to watch.
- The series has a light mix of nudity, ecchi, and fan service but nothing over the top, its mostly used to add a bit of comedy to the show.
- It has comedy, action, and romance which make a great combination with all the cute stuff in the series.
- Super cute! Ryoko has cat gloves that she beats enemies up with and they keep getting upgraded as the series progresses making them even more cute. There are also many other cute things in the series like the way that some of the characters behave or dress.
- Very fair price, $35 for 12 episodes on blu-ray and dvd format.
- I love the intro and ending videos, the video game theme in the ending video was awesome.

Cons
---------
- The English subtitles don't match what the characters are saying on the screen with the English dubs in some scenes. It makes some of the characters attitudes a little bit different in the subtitles and it kind of makes you wonder which one is the real message that the creator of the series was trying to convey to the audience. Some of the message might have been lost in translation or altered in order to have the characters talking animations sync correctly with the translated audio but this is common when watching dubbed anime, some of the original message is always lost or altered in the translation.
- The narrator sometimes talks over some of the characters in the series so you cant hear some of the characters conversations but you can still read it in the subtitles.
- The ending was alright it concluded some things but it still leaves some other things unresolved that could be continued in a second season. Hopefully the creators follow up with a second season of this great series or at least release some ovas with alternate endings.

Conclusion
----------
Its a great series to own, right now there are 12 episodes in a dvd/blu-ray combo box set for $35. The series is definitely worth checking out if your a fan of comedy, romance and cute stuff. To get the best experience out of this release if you hate reading subtitles then I suggest watching the series with English audio and English subtitles that way you can watch the series in English and still know what your missing out on storyline wise if you would have seen the series with Japanese audio and English subtitles. Watching the series with the subtitles on will also allow you to read some of the conversations that the characters have when the narrator is talking at the same time as the characters.",1333324800,22,4535,4.487893462469733
5048781,4,B0071LEMQ4,"NOTE: INCLUDES POSSIBLE SPOILERS

Ookami-san and her 7 companions isn't particularly remarkable as series go. J.C. Staff brings top shelf production quality and the character design is fun if a little cliche (a fake loli, perpetual maid, moe mad scientist, super tsundere and a relatively weak-sauce but surprisingly solid male lead).

The story follows the members of the Otogi Bank, a mutual help association that does favors for favors - helping people out with certain requests and asking for their help at a later date. It's here that Morino-kun comes on the scene, confessing his affection for Ookami-san, the titular lead. Through a series of adventures the two try working out a troubled but ultimately sweet relationship.

The series plays off a number of fairy tales. Ookami-san (wolf) is Akai-san's (red, as in little red riding hood) best friend. Then there is Shirayuki-hime (Snow White) who has seven siblings. And so it goes. It makes for a fun backdrop.

One has to hope [POSSIBLE SPOILERS IMMANENT!!!] this is a first installment (though i haven't checked, recently, on plans for another season) as a number of central storylines remain unresolved: Ookami still hasn't told Morino about her past, Shirou is still at large with Rikkun's threat hanging over his head, etc. And ""I don't dislike him"" is hardly sufficient relational development.

Overall, the series is enjoyable but not a must see. It resembles (and even has a brief cameo by the cast of) A Certain Scientific Railgun in many ways. A group of cute characters running around having fun little adventures. I liked it well enough.

***EDIT***
One thing i forgot to mention. It is really annoying that the narrator and characters talk over each other the entire show. While i like the narration, the subtitles become atrociously hard to follow.",1329955200,19,1821,5.053333333333334
5048782,5,B0071LEMQ4,"It is one of the best short single season shows released within the last few years.

The show brings in characters from a variety of fables and stories. The most prominent is Red Riding Hood, The Big Bad Wolf, and the hunter who hunts the wolf. Each character is recreated into a modern day anime counterpart. It's story centers around the Big Bad Wolf, Okami-san. The companions and friends make up a sort of school mafia organization. They take jobs and handle student problems to earn favors which they can then call in later at anytime they want. The school itself is then part of a larger group which owns the city. The concept of a feudal society mixed with mafia tones in how things run, is very prominent.

Characters themselves are more akin to generic anime in style and presentation. There is the weak guy, the tough girl, and the schemer...along with all the other common threads like the fan service character/etc. But the interactions of these characters, coming from their fable roots, brings a degree of freshness to the anime that gives it a step above others. Each character has well designed backgrounds and some are very rich. When you recognize who these characters are referencing, you will see new life being breathed into the classic storybook characters.

This is a series that will leave you wanting a second season, but for the most part, it does come to a decent stop point at the end. Art style is good and the voices are excellent. The Amazon page lists it currently as Japanese language, but the actors listed and the fact that it is Funimation means it could have an English dub. Hopefully it is a decent dub if there really is one. It is hard to imagine this show done in English. The personalities are so key to characters like Ringo or Okami. Future edit will note this once it is released.

Great series, one of the best in recent years. It will cause you to rethink your opinion of the Big Bad Wolf and Red Riding Hood. Enjoy it! See if you can name all the fables used! You might have to wiki it to figure them all out!!",1328918400,44,2058,4.509383378016086

5048800,5,B0071LEMQ4,"Recently there has been a trend of these REALLY FANTASTIC Anime shows that are too short. Normally they get through 8 or 9 episodes and then put the pedal to the metal in order to get the story told in the time remaining. Best example: Demon King Daimao. Another would be High School DxD. In the second case, a second series did come along, was done very well, and makes the screaming-to-the-finish ending of the first all the more obvious. Same could be said of K-On, though in it's defense it ran at the same pace as the manga.

Okami-San, however, does not suffer that rushed-ending. Instead, the pace builds steadily throughout, and when the final credits roll you fully expect another episode to start. Then you got check the package and read (to your horror) that there are only 12 episodes! OH NO!

This is a good one. Scratch that, this is a GREAT one. It's Moe, is Tsundere, its ecchi, and it has one heck of a great story to boot.

5048820,5,B0071LEMQ4,"In the city of Otogibana the characters of fairy tales and folklore attended rival schools with the virtuous characters attending Otogi high school and the villainous characters attending Onigashima high school. A group of Otogi high school students establish the Otogi bank a club that can be hired to solve the problems of their schoolmates in exchange for the recipient owing the club a favor which can be redeemed at anytime and can't be refused. The heavy hitting Ryoko (the wolf), her best friend Ringo (red riding hood) and the smitten Ryoshi (the hunter) along with the rest of the Otogi bank members will do their best to help their schoolmates as well as each other.

One of the funniest things of the show is the narrator who often makes comical, sarcastic and offensive remarks about the characters which cause them to break the fourth wall to give the narrator dirty looks.

The animation is top notch, the characters are intriguing, the story is sidesplittingly funny and the English dub is excellent making this series a must own for any anime fan especially if they enjoy fairy tales and folklore!

Some people may be annoyed by the narrator and characters occasionally talking over each other as for myself it didn't bother me and I had no problem understanding what was being said.

Be warned this anime contains some fan service so it may not be suitable for children!

5048823,5,B0071LEMQ4,"I'm severely disappointed that they did not continue this series. For a lesser known anime, it's plot and dialogue were actually a little more down to earth than some other shows. To me, it's another great show that got cut short (like Spice and Wolf). They could have easily done another 2 or 3 seasons. And they left the plot wide open for continuation, none of the main characters got to work through their flaws more and there's still a threat on the horizon with the rival school of rapist thugs (in my opinion Shirou needs to die by Ryouko's hand, slow, painful, and screaming like a little girl, but I don't want to get too in depth here.) I'm going to read the manga and see if they continued the story. Watch the first episode or two and see if you get hooked.",1387065600,,769,4.347222222222222
5048824,5,B0071LEMQ4,"Okami-san and Her Seven Companions is one of those rare shows that can appeal to many different types of viewers.  It has action, comedy, and of course romance.  The characters in this show are what make watching the 12 episodes fly by in the blink of an eye.  Now having finished the series I would love to have seen it be a 24-26 episode series, since there was so much more they could have touched on in the later episodes.

All the characters in the show are likable and by the end of it you really feel for all of them.  This only being 12 episodes they didn't give a backstory to every character, but the ones that they did really made them stand out compared to many other anime I have watched recently.  That being said one of my callouts to this series would have to be the length.  As much as it was a delight to watch, the story is left somewhat open ended and it would've made more sense to have it continue longer.

The other part of the series I want to touch on is the narrator that seems to be the reason for some of Okami-san's bad reviews.  In all honesty did the narrator get frustrating during certain times I was watching?  Yes, but overall I would have to say she did more good than bad throughout the series as a whole, so please don't let that deter you from picking this series up.
Overall this is one of the better series I have watched in recent memory.  With the great characters and the fairy tale tie ins for the characters and plots alike, it's a solid 9.5/10.",1385424000,,1491,4.23321554770318

Who would guess that an anime based on Western fairy tales but set in a Japanese high school could be so engaging? It is, however, with strong characters and  dark and light moments mixed together. This series is one of the best examples of why I love anime, being able to use a seemingly improbable plot device (a secret group of high schoolers who 'do favors') to touchingly tell how one tough-on-the-outside girl learns to rely on other peoples' strength and to risk being vulnerable to love.",1361318400,2,587,4.59047619047619

The reason being was the review comments about how annoying it was having the speaker talking over the characters.  That right away sounded like something I would not like and would ruin the anime watching experience for me.

So after a time, I finally ended up getting this series.  Turns out imo, I find that I LIKE the narrator's witty banter during the story.  I think it works how they added it in.  And after that the actual story, character voices, and everything else made this a fun series for me to watch.  I happily give this series 5 stars because it seemed to me that as soon as I started it, it was over.  :)

Plus I thought the fighting gloves that the Okami-san wore were super cute.  I'd totally date a girl who wore crime fighting gloves such as those.",1359763200,5,983,4.2771739130434785

To a certain extent you won't understand why some of the characters behave the way they do without some understanding of Japanese culture. On the other hand, that's not necessary to enjoy the series.  By and large, with the exception of a couple of heavy episodes, this series is played for entertainment rather than for Serious Business. Unlike, say, Kino's Journey or Serial Experiments Lain, you won't be pondering the mysteries of the universe. You'll just laugh, cheer, and have a good time, assuming that you recognize the stock characters being spoofed and appreciate the snarky narrator (yes, she's annoying, but she's supposed to be -- she's the Japanese equivalent of that Jewish grandmother that's always making inappropriate comments about her grandchildren, their love lives, marriage potential, and their, err, assets, and if you've ever encountered that kind of person in real life you'll be laughing your head off at some of her inappropriate commentary).

5048840,4,B0071LEMQ4,"Ryoko Okami is a member of an odd jobs club at her high school. The club is called the Otogi Bank. They will do nearly anything in exchange for a favor that will be determined and asked for later. So there kinda like the mob, or loan sharks. Ryoko and her partner do all sorts of heavy handed stuff for their club. One of the boys in the club is obsessed with Ryoko and will do anything to get her attention. This includes fighting gangs from other high schools.

This anime was kind of a let down for me. It is beautifully drawn and has very unique vibe too. The story kind of like a very PG rated Ikki Tousen high school set up crossed with old fables and fairy tales. The animation is probably the best part of this series. It was very similar to Spice and Wolf. There is a lot of fighting in it. I think the character development needed some work to make it great. It had a relatively satisfying ending, but I felt like something was missing. I do think that the problems with this anime could be resolved if a 2nd season was made and focused more on character relationships than on fighting.

All in all it's a good show, but it had more potential than it actually achieved.",1350432000,,1179,4.235555555555556

Every time I started getting into the story she'd make some asinine comment about the female character's lack of breasts or something equally pointless. She's constantly undermining the story and making fun of the characters. If they were going for funny it just came off as annoying. It's like going to a movie and having to sit next to someone who talks really loud and has to keep up a running commentary the whole time. I was going to rate this 1 star but I gave it 2 because I felt the rest of the anime had promise, however I couldn't finish it because the narrator got so annoying.

5048843,2,B0071LEMQ4,"First off I'd like to say that I'm not going to totally bash this anime, cause' I know quite a few people who like it. That being said, I ordered this anime because I'm really into wolves/wolf girls (kinda like Spice and Wolf) and I thought Ryouko (Main Protagonist) looked A LOT like Holo (Spice and Wolf). So I picked this up and thought cause' I haven't watched an anime in a while and thought,""This might work"". And it did for the first 4 episodes, then I took a brake from watching it, and when i finally decided to continue where i left off, I found i could only finish ep 5. After that I said, ""To hell with it"". It just....didn't hold my interest for quite too long. Well, on to the actual review.

PROS:
.Good animation. The characters move very fluently and the colors are very bright.
.REAL NICE PACKAGING-Just one of the many reasons why I love FUNimation! It comes in a very sturdy chip-board box, and If you were to accidently drop it, the disks inside would not brake. So that's a plus right there.
.Pretty Good Dub. FUNimation sadly doesn't ALWAYS do a good dub, but this time around it was actually really good. I was very surprised to here Micah Solusod again, because FUNi doesn't usually use him.

CONS:
.Characters were VERY generic. They were all base off fairy-tales so they don't really deliver. I also didn't like the way Ryoushi (male lead) was ALWAYS getting pushed around by Ryouko (female lead) and he would STILL cling to her (literally) like a lost puppy-dog. I thought that, ""This stuff just doesn't happen in real life."" I know if I was getting smacked around all the time--my a$$ would be out the door.
.Terrible fantasy-like music. Althought it is a givin' since it IS a fantasy anime.
.Plot was very bad in my opionin. I thought, ""It's just another school anime."" Which some school animes are good, such as Clannad, Angel Beats, or Highschool of the Dead.
.LAST BUT NOT LEAST: THE NARRATOR- I know I definitely speak for a lot of people when I say the narrator COMPLETELY ruins the series. This was one of the major reasons why it turned me off from watching it, also why I could not finish it.

OVERALL: This anime is good for some, but not for all (such as myself) and please don't let the review stop you from buying it if you really want to if that's what you are into. Again this is just MY OPINION. So don't get mad- afterall this IS a review.",1346284800,9,2385,4.415909090909091
5048844,5,B0071LEMQ4,"At first, when I had heard the reviews on this series, bring that there was a bad English, I was a little bit bother by it. But After just going head to by it, I have to save that they did a wonderful job with the dub.

The Studio that did the wonderful yet popular series, Toradora, and Shkaugan no shana, has created another story with a fabvled-minded story full of fairy tale tomfoolery, attractive archetypes, allusion to allegories parodies that might capture your heart.

The story is about Ryoko Okami as you can say a ""Wolf"" and heroine of the story and along with her Best friend Ringo, also known as Little Red riding hood, are members of Otogi Bank which is also a known as a high school club (Similar to Ouran High school host club if you seen the seires) that helps classmates with their problems Later a boy, comes along thier bank and confesses his love for Ryoko, how rejects him. But joins the Otgi Bank to prove his feelings for love for her, even though he mostly a ""screwup"" but is willing to take a blow to be her ""Sheild.""

Each episodes deals with a problem within the request or within the Bank themselves, which in the end learns a lesson. I tell you, I couldn't stop watching this series for a minute. And once again, funimation didn't let me down with the dub, for the cast did a wonderful job.

No people have complain this one major issue within this series. Which seems to be the narrator. Luci Christain did the Narrotor and Ringo's mother in this series. But I think she made it more funny and more Fairy tale like, Like she was telling this Fairy tale to a child. And even if you don't like the dub, the Sub as a narrator taking as well, so I don't see why the dub is horrible. I love them both, and I could stand to watch it till the end so If you into this kind of heroine who we could say is a Tsunadere or is Cold to the hero but then lovey dovey later on I would say give this a go. However I might recommend watching the sub or dub on Youtube so you can get he drift.

As for the box, it kind like a cardboard but beautiful and cute and the same time. It comes with 4 disk 2 for DVD and 2 for Blu-ray (Each have same artcover on the disk so make sure you look at them first) Except for the cover on the case which has 2 different artworks with Okami-san (One of her Date with ryoshi) and the Other with her new power up costume.

Extras include: Episode Commentaries, Tokyo Intertional Anime Fair, Promotional Video, Commricals for the Enlgish and Japanese Trailers, Textless Songs and Trailers.",1345852800,,2622,4.274193548387097

I forget where I heard this before but I would say Okami-san is a kinda, romaction anime. It's part love story but has a good amount of action in it. I do wish it was longer than 12 episodes and even though I'm used to that, some, like this one, could have done with more. Don't get me wrong, it doesn't decrease the appeal of it. I suppose that it leaves you wanting more. That seems like the perfect way to describe that.

Okami-san also has a good deal of humor in it too and I think it fits in perfectly. This anime mixes aspects of romance, action and humor and is an altogether great anime.
