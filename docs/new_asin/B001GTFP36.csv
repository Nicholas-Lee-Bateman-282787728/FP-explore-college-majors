The beginning and ending songs are beautiful and I love the erhu music strewn throughout the series. I love the characters - they are strong and endearing. and no irritating, ignorant, cutsie girls that you find so often in anime.
(I also like Fushigi Yugi, BTW).",1357516800,,341,4.60655737704918

8306931,1,B001GTFP36,"The quality of this product is really bad, the subtitles are off, the script is very bad (only a plain yellow), the opening and closing song subtitles have grammatical and spelling errors, they have changed some names (The main character's family name is Kou and in the dvd version they sub it as Hong,which could be the korean equivalent if Kou but this anime uses mostly japanese names, so why would you change it if there is no reason to change it??? For those of us who are bilingual or can at least hear can tell the difference in names), some areas the subtitles were cut off, I don't think that even a third rate fan subbing group could have done any worse.  It's almost or just as bad as the ones that come from china.  This is really sad since it comes from a legit. company like geneon.  Save your money and dl the free version, the quality and subbing is so much better.  However, if you don't really care about the subs and stuff like that and you only watch the dubbed version, this would be a good buy for the money.",1305072000,,1030,4.293814432989691
