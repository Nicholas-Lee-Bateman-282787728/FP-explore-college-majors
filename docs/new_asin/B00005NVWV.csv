7947902,5,B00005NVWV,"Great anthology. My favorite story has a woman convinced a vampire is after her! ALL the stories were pretty entertaining, even if the first story was kinda slowww. Cast was pretty good, wish Debbie Rochon had actually being in it though.",1444953600,,238,4.829268292682927

7947906,4,B00005NVWV,"This horror anthology is probably made with a MiniDV camcorder and is very low budget, but I thought they did a great job considering its cheapness. They didn't have much money to work with, but they managed to create a very effective horror anthology. There's some nudity and blood before the stories start; and there's some wrap around stuff before, between, and after the stories which involve the police questioning a cremator. There's some topless and rear nudity, as well as some full frontal. Despite the movies cheapness, it has some decent nude scenes. The film has some gore in it, but don't expect anything over the top; if you want something very gory with extreme gore scenes, you'll be disappointed. They probably didn't have enough money to make it really bloody. The first story involving a cult who signals out people to be sacrificed because of a mark on their hands has no gore or nudity, but it's suspenseful and entertaining. The second story is about a teenage boy abducted by a killer. This story has no gore or nudity either and concentrates on suspense. The last two stories involve lesbian vampires and a charred walking killer corpse wearing a hat. These are the most explicit tales with blood and nudity. All these tales are well directed, and the acting is OK for a cheap independent shot on digital video film. One thing that really helps the movie is that it has some good soundtracks; I particularly liked the music during one of the scenes in the lesbian vampire story. I did think that some of the wrap around stuff served as basically some filler, and the first two stories may bore some people, but if you're a big horror anthology fan and are used to seeing these cheap independent shot on digital video films, you might want to check this one out. I think some more gore would've definitely helped, but this anthology is very well done for its budget.

The picture is reasonably sharp and the brightness is OK, but the colors are washed out and the contrast is basically poor. There are extras on the DVD like a behind the scenes feature.",1363305600,,2076,4.672131147540983
7947907,2,B00005NVWV,"...  no actually it's not to terribly bad.  i was expecting a lot worse but it wasn't to bad of a movie.  had 4 short stories like such movies as creep show, nightmares, terror tract and so on.  two of the short stories were pretty good and one was just an excuse for a ridiculous amount of nudity.  but all in all it's worth checking out, decent flick for an independent film.",1025740800,,377,4.180555555555555
7947908,3,B00005NVWV,"I bought this DVD based solely on the creepiness of the female vampire featured on the cover.  I honestly didn't know what to expect.  Here's what I got...
The ""film"" quality was horrid.  The movie seemed to be filmed with a home camcorder, including terrible lighting and poor sound quality.  Some of the dialogue sounded like it was recorded on a tape deck with a hand held microphone jammed into the actors mouths.
Acting was sub par all around.  At times the cast overacted (the interrogated man) or passively drone out their lines (the haunted blonde).
Now, before you begin to think I have nothing nice to say about the film, let me assure you that it does have some redeeming points.  The brunette vampire was very good and seemed to enjoy her part.  The efx, while hampered by an obviously low budget, were convincing.  The blood was a very, very realistic color.  It may seem like a small thing, but believe me, off-color blood can ruin a scene's believability quicker than bad acting.
As some other reviewers mentioned, the stories were pretty original.  I especially liked the one about the lady in the car and the vampire tale.  It is unfortunate that Steve Sessions used black and white for the vampire scene, thereby losing the effect of those great red contact lenses.
I give the film 4 stars for story, 2 stars for quality, and 3 stars for acting.  A 3-star average.  Rent it if you can.  Then, if you enjoy it, consider purchasing it.  It includes some behind the scenes features including better shots of the vampire girls.",1003449600,11,1541,4.655555555555556
7947909,5,B00005NVWV,"The opening scene was unneeded and the first segment needed better explanation, but most of the movie was GREAT! some really scarey scenes, alot of beautiful babes! the vampire scene was my favorite, the two girls were hot in that one!  followed by the last story with the hideous cremainder monster in it!!!! Great soundtrack, and lots of blood and gore I really enjoyed the movie!  it would be great for HALLOWEEN!",997315200,2,416,4.763888888888889
