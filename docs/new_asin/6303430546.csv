650880,5,6303430546,"These last two words were what SHOULD have been added to the last line of the film to make this excellent movie even better. John Cusack, in one of his better roles, plays an aspiring playwright during the 1920s, and considers himself to be a great one--although he later learns that he really isn't. Like his Marxist-inclined intellectual friend Flender (Rob Reiner, looking very much the part), Cusack thinks that art is of supreme importance, perhaps even more important than human life itself. Discussing art in a Greenwich Village cafe, Reiner gives the analogy of a burning building: if you could rush in and save only one of two things--a human being or the last known copy of Shakespeare's works, which would you save? His answer, of course, is Shakespeare's works. Why say such a horrible thing? Because to intellectuals, art ""lives."" You'd have no right to ""deprive the world of this great art"" just to save the life of ""an anonymous human being,"" he says. Cusack agrees. But this belief is put to the test when in order to save a work of art, gangster Cheech (well-played by Chazz Palmentieri) actually commits murder. Cusack then realizes that no work of art is worth a human life after all. At this point, Cusack says, ""I'm NOT an artist.""",989452800,5,1252,4.747706422018348
650881,4,6303430546,"'Bullets Over Broadway' is in many respects an unusual Woody Allen film. I think he made it because he had some ideas he wanted to exploit, and above all, the film is a hommage to 1930s theatre.
The setting is... New York in the 1930s - Broadway, the Mob, the lot. And Allen once again uses his choice of surroundings to back up the typical atmosphere of the showbiz industry, with its minor and major scandals. In fact, this could be interpreted as a parody on today's Hollywood! 'Cause 'Bullets Over Broadway' may be a hommage, but it certainly is a parody as well. In the unique Woody Allen way!
It's beuatifully done - the actors are very well chosen (nearly stereotyping their roles, ach and every one of them!), and the whole scenery, the colours, the atmosphere are just so over-1930s!
A witty and entertaining film, worth seeing.",981763200,,837,4.624161073825503

650883,4,6303430546,"Oh Woody, Woody, Woody. When he is funny, he is one of the best comic writers around, and in this movie his writing is hilarious. What other auteur in the cinema today can poke fun at those little idiosyncracies that we all see in ourselves, and get away with it?
Our hero, in a rare departure is not played by Woody Allen but rather, John Cusack, who gives a subtle performance, rather than the over-the-top pisstake by Kenneth Branagh in ""Celebrity"". He is trying to get his latest play staged, and can only do so by accepting money from the Mob and having a mobster's girlfriend, with no talent, take one of his lead roles. The humour that ensues centres around each of the plays characters, from the fading diva played by Dianne Wiest to the compulsive eater played by the magnificent Jim Broadbent, as they prepare for the play's debut on Broadway. All the performances are spot on and the only criticism comes in the ham-fisted fashion that the film concludes with a mobsters shootout and its all too happy ending.
Nevertheless this is well worth watching to hear great comic lines and the splendid cast who deliver them.",964137600,5,1127,4.64
650884,3,6303430546,"__________________
This one never quite took off for me. The setting was supposed to be the gangster era, but Allen can't seem to write dialogue that is either convincing or just funny when he tries to emulate those movies he saw as a kid. This one seemed like an awkward knockoff of ""Hannah and Her Sisters"" without much of a plot. Pygmalion crept into the film, but that's pretty common in his films. This one wasn't funny enough to be a comedy or serious enough to be a drama. OTOH, it seems to be pretty popular, so you may like it.",960940800,2,536,4.316831683168317
650885,4,6303430546,"When Woody Allen writes a screenplay about Broadway, it is necessarily explosive. He sees and shows every single little funny aspect of artists, males and females, actors, playwrights and all the others. The women are  hysterical, selling themselves not by the pound but by the line, or even  the cue. Men are slobs that eat, drink and take adavantage of those cheap  but transient women. Woody Allen even adds some Italian maffia in the whole  business, including on the stage before the premiere or even during and  after. The bodyguard becomes the real playwright and he kills the  girlfriend of his boss because she is not a good enought actress. And he  then gets executed by the gunmen of his boss directly in the wings of the  New York premiere. It is not the film where you will laugh out like a noisy  bunch of firecrackers. But It is funny all along, humorous, witty, and the  situations are so silly and ridiculous that those puppets that the  actresses and actors are become like a bunch of crazy termites turning  psychotic by the second and schizophrenic by the minute. The film attacks  you in your common sense and simple-mindedness. You used to think that the  theater, be it Broadway in New York or Covent Garden in London, was a world  of glamour, passion, beauty and style. You discover it is a mean mean mean  world of pettiness and petticoats, and you do not know any more if you  prefer the pettiness of these midgets or the petticoats of those dwarves.  Everyone is so small in that world that you feel like a giant when  reclining in your armchair and listening to their rowdy bull. If you had  any intention of entering the career, you will definitely turn your coat  around and trace your steps back to your armchair and your night-cap. And  yet, there is some charm in this crazy folly, and that charm is just  undescribable and Woody Allen makes us feel it in the last sad and  anticlimactic scene that goes back to the gutter running in front of the  beautidul and luminous marquees.

650886,4,6303430546,"How could you possibly be wrong with a Woody Allen movie ! You can be sure to enjoy solid actors, great jazz music and the always recognizable Allen touch. His movies are at the least of above-average quality and often at  the level of pure masterpieces. Let's be honest ! Not so many directors can  pretend to such a filmography.
BULLETS OVER BROADWAY develops typical  Allen themes such as the thin margin existing between cinema, in this movie  more precisely theatre, and the real world, the secret of artistic  inspiration or the delicate critique of the so-called intellectual circles.  It's also a dark comedy with moments of deep emotion such as the complete  rewrite of John Cusack's play by the inspired mafioso Chazz  Palminteri.
As always, actors are wonderful with a special mention to  John Cusack who portraits a young Woody Allen clone forced to admit that he  hasn't any talent at all. That's not given to everybody !
No special  features except a scene access (is it really a so special feature after all  ?) and english subtitles that can be very annoying at times because Woody  Allen's characters spend a lot of time talking and talking and  talking...
A DVD that is going to be better and better with years passing  by.",957398400,2,1241,4.733644859813084

651141,3,6303430546,"Being on something of a Woody Allen kick lately, I gave this one a look again as I'd not seen it since its first appearance a couple decades ago. My opinion then was a lot higher than it is now. I find BOB to have lots of pretentious, clichd dialogue along with the usual Allen tropes. The self-important, over-the-top characters are bad enough but the high powered stars over-act and chew scenery every chance they get. Worst by far is Diane Wiest, who  incredibly  snared an Oscar for her insufferably exaggerated performance as the admittedly self-absorbed drama queen Helen Sinclair.
BOB does have the requisite Allen look: lots of Art Deco and a burnished, Rembrant-esque lighting that sometimes was so murky it made it difficult to tell what was going on. The idea of a vicious mob enforcer with the heart - and talent - of an artiste to me is fascinating, and I confess I do find Cuzacks and Palminteris performances fetching, and they have good chemistry. But overall if Id describe BOB its that its way over-rated, both by critics and general movie-goers. Three stars, just barely.",1435536000,,1090,4.761904761904762

The cast is wonderful, the production design is stunning, and it's laugh out loud funny. Jennifer Tilly and Dianne Weist are just great, as is Tracy Ullman, who almost steals the show as the hysterical English import. The scene where they all come together to rehearse the play is a highlight. The only time the film takes a slight nose dive is when the two romantic leads get involved. Their material isn't as funny as the earlier part of the film and John Cusack isn't a comedian. I was hoping the musical would be a triumph, beacause I thought it would work, but sadly it didn't. These are performances that just can't be matched, let alone bettered. It's a hoot.",1408060800,,757,4.573529411764706
651338,1,6303430546,"One of the worst digital transfers I've had the misfortune to experience in a while.  There's very poor image quality, most egregious in the steam bath scene.  The DVD was also created with 4:3 aspect ratio, and as a result there's very noticeable pan and scan.  This last issue is all the more disappointing given that Amazon lists the film as having a 1.85:1 aspect ratio, which is clearly false after watching this DVD.

Being that this DVD was originally released in 1999, it's probably no wonder it suffers from being poorly transferred to digital since that was fairly early on in the age of DVD's and before we had higher resolution television screens.  Still it's no excuse to allow such a fine film as this in today's day and age to have such a poor representation, especially at the price they're asking (which has even gone up since I purchased it).  If you've continued reading this far, my advice would have been to buy the Blu-Ray instead, however the reviews for the Blu-Ray are also bad so I'm afraid it might be best to wait until someone releases a remastered version.",1407974400,4,1086,4.630208333333333

651441,4,6303430546,"This is not the best in movie making. There are, as they say in live theater, problems in the second act.

What matters is that director and coauthor Woody Allen takes for granted that you have intelligence and are willing to think. The best laugh lines require you to pay attention, they go fast. Most of them are in the beginning. The first 15 minutes of the movie include a series of set ups for great one lines, each tossed out amidst high speed overlapping conversations.  By 20 minutes in the humor becomes rare.

By this point the purpose of the movie is to demonstrate the high contrast between thinking and talking a certain way and living it. Artists like to talk about the right of artists to make their own morality. Mobsters live that life, mostly without thinking about it.

The actual plot of the movie involves an up and coming serious writer of serious plays. The only way he can get money for his play is 1) accepting mobster money and with it the condition that 2.) the mob boss's girlfriend- a no talent showgirl with a terrible voice and no brains has a leading role.
The deal with the devil is accepted and the play goes into production and (surprise) re-write. Much of the rest of the next hour is fairly stock scenes of the producing of a play. This portion of the movie would be a drag, except that the rest of the cast provide a flow of wonderful acting and the writing is just original enough that what are stock scenes have words and acting that keep you involved.

There is a marked shift to the dramatic as a harsh reality forces you the viewer and the playwright to understand the real questions of this movie.

Paying attention and you can see Woody Allen and co-writer Douglas McGrath making sharp digs into the pretensions of artist, leftist coffee house intellectuals and everyone who confuses schooling with learning. There is a side show debate over the love of the artist and love of the person. This too is resolved and not in favor of art.

I liked Bullets over Broadway. I also agree with the wife who pronounced it ""Weird"". You are promised a ""Side Splitting Comedy"" and that is not what you get. The flow of the movie is uneven, largely because of the need to tell a complex story such that the ending is inevitable. This is not a movie for those looking to relax and be entertained. It is a thinking person's movie.",1401494400,3,2359,4.472093023255814

651666,5,6303430546,"I love Woody Allen.  I have for years.  I've indulged in his sporadic comedies of the 70's and fell in love with his more polished and poignant works of the 80's, and I've championed his resurgence in the 00's, but up until yesterday I was detached from his work in the 90's, mainly because I hadn't seen the one film that many consider one of his best; `Bullets Over Broadway'.  This isn't just one of his best films of the 90's, it's one of his best films PERIOD.

This deliciously paced comedy centers on a playwright, David, looking for his big break.  He gets it, but not in the fashion that he was expecting.  Instead of betting to mold his play the way he desires, he gets handed an iron clad contract designating who will star in his play and basically how the play will be run.  Gangster Nick Valenti wants his girlfriend Olive to be happy, and Olive won't be happy until she's a star, and so he funds David's play under the condition that Olive, who has no talent, get a juicy part.  The lead goes to a washed up drunk named Helen Sinclair who has retained her reputation due to her past work and is not so happy about the lack of sexuality and presence her character possesses.  Soon, David finds his play running away from him as the cast bickers with one another, Helen manipulates David for her own persona gain and Olive's mouthy bodyguard, Cheech, begins to rewrite David's play...for the better!

The film has such flow, washing from one scene to the next with breakneck speed and yet always maintaining its identity.  The script is hilarious, and the way the actors attack each scene is remarkable to watch.  Everyone here is a caricature and yet they all feel so alive.  This send back to the glory days of gangsters at the movies is a real trip and deserves all the praise it can muster.

And can we just say that Dianne Wiest's Oscar win may be the best this category has EVER seen!  She's in complete Shirley MacLaine revival mode here, and she nails every single second, every nuanced emotion and every calculated response.

651668,5,6303430546,"this time woody allen goes back to the prohibition era to examine what makes an artist and what doesn't using the Broadway stage.  on one hand we have a bunch of thugs with Chaz Palmentieri having to act as head thug bodyguard for the boss's girlfriend.  on the other we have a crew of theater people who are all convinced they are artists but most especially the diva played by Diane Wiest.  irritatingly to the theater people it becomes increasingly obvious that the person with the most artistic talent in that theater is the thug bodyguard!

this is played very broadly and satirically with each theatrical person going completely over the top.  the boss's girlfriend, played by Jennifer Tilly, is unbelievably terrible as an actress (hilarious) and Jim Broadbent is a compulsive eater who is exploding out of his clothes. Rob Reiner is an artist who won't sully himself by publishing anything. and John Cusack is the Woody Allen stand in. i am referring here to allen's looking for other male actors to play the roles in his films which he usually took himself. over the decades he has had to use more and more of these younger actors because he can no longer play a romantic lead. this film also lacks diane keaton and mia farrow, two other longtime staples in allen films.  this is an early forerunner of where we are today because all of these early performers are now in their sixties and seventies and can no longer play the leads.

this is primarily screwball comedy from start to finish although it does grapple with the issue of the wild card art talent is and the lack of control over who gets that talent.

I had seen the film before, when it came out, but, happily, I had no precise memory of it. His playwright will stand with any of those created for Broadway or Hollywood, not, perhaps, allowed the pure innocence of James Stewart, but with a simplicity all his own combined with the patina available only in NYC. (No doubt, Mr. Allen is well aware that, among others, George S. Kaufman, a pre-eminent Broadway figure, came out of Pittsburgh).
Each performer stood out. Each seemed to move easily into Woody's World in which stage and ""real life"" were interchangeable.

Here, new young playwright/director David Shayne (John Cusack) is clearly in way over his head. He fights furiously for the plot and dialogue of a lousy script, and threatens to quit more than once at the hint of interference, but in the end David gives in to various actor demands. This causes him much remorse. Expressed late at night while stalking his bedroom in strange linen shortie PJs, David repeatedly screams: ""I'm a whorrrrreeeeee!""  By this point of total defeat, he also permits a foul-mouthed mob hitman named Cheech (Chazz Palmintieri) to rewrite the entire play, and even encourages his help.

For his part, Cheech starts out as a disinterested observer of rehearsals, reluctantly keeping an eye on the boss's moll, but once he puts his two cents in with line and plot improvements, Cheech becomes more protective of ""God of Our Fathers"" than its creator. To Cheech's mind, the only fault with ""his"" play lies in the gal he's supposed to protect...

...Olive Neal (Jennifer Tilly), a kindred spirit of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SINGIN-IN-THE-RAIN/dp/B000NI8F5G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SINGIN' IN THE RAIN</a>'s Lina Lamont. Miss Tilly's screechy, untalented chorus girl pal of the gangster who's bankrolling Shayne's turgid disaster is perfection every second she's on the screen. Imagine this floozy trying to carry the role of a psychiatrist? To use Olive's own ""brilliant"" ad-lib: ""HA!""

Tracey Ullman's annoyingly chirpy Eden Brent hands out ""hello"" gifts and jokes that she breast feeds her ever-present, always yapping chihuahua. No one at the rehearsal table doubts this.

Jim Broadbent as diet-challenged leading man Warner Purcell rapidly eats himself into the shape and size of a small dirigible. If you need a quick nosh, just reach into any of Warner's pockets. This glutton even steals the chihuahua's doggy snacks. His belly corset is about to burst apart but Warner keeps greedily shoveling in the grub.

Dianne Weist as Helen Sinclair, a deeply-into-middle-age leading lady, starts an off-stage romance with her latest director. Helen thinks David's rewrites are brilliant; he's guilt-stricken and wants to confess that every new idea and line belongs to thuggish Cheech. Whenever David tries to come clean or profess his love, Helen puts a hand over his mouth and drowns out all words with: ""Don't speak. Don't speak. No, don't speak. Don't, don't, don't"" etc.

Even peripheral characters, like Rob Reiner's Marxist playwright Sheldon Flender (who wears theatrical failure as a badge of honor), or Jack Warden as Julian Marx, David's nervous agent, have more than one amusing moment. A final hat tip to Joe Viterelli as da Boss, Nick Valenti, the deep-pocketed gangster without whom ""God of Our Fathers"" never would've gotten to rehearsals. Nick has the charm of three bulldogs and a way with words that would make a longshoreman blush.

Past the Boston tryout stage now, and with the play due for its Broadway debut, the simmering Cheech has secretly found a way to make everything just right....

'11).

SYNOPSIS--

In this Prohibition era farce, a mobster bankrolls an unknown, talentless dramatist's new play and as part of the deal strong-arms his equally untalented girlfriend into a major role. The aging leading lady, an often inebriated adulteress, seduces the playwright so that her part can be enlarged in rewrites. The leading man grows enormously fat from clandestine rehearsal binge eating and tries to hide his expanding waistline with a corset.

Watching from the back of the theater is the gangster's scary-looking legbreaker, there to guard the big guy's girlfriend, an egomaniacal ignoramus with a voice like a bucket of glass. This inarticulate thug thinks the show as it stands is terrible, so he rewrites pages of clumsy dialogue and turns a disaster into a potential hit (if his boss's sweety doesn't appear in it). Great fun and perfectly paced, this one has a just-right finale. Another superior work by Mr. Allen.

651801,4,6303430546,"""Bullets Over Broadway"" entertains throughout.  The movie is perfectly directed by Woody Allen in his unique style and humorous look at life on Broadway.  John Cusack plays David Shayne, a young playwright who is ambitious and yearning to get his play, God of our Fathers, on Broadway.  All he needs is a financial backer.  Lo and behold, Nick Valenti, a local gangster, offers to back his play s long as David agrees to give a significant part to his girlfriend, Olive Neal (Jennifer Tilly).  Olive is a self-centered, squeaky high-voiced former chorus girl.  After some angst, David agrees to do the play with the silly, talentless Olive, who will take the part of psychiatrist. Valenti insists she be watched at all times by Cheech, a hoodlum bodyguard.  Cheech has to sit in the audience as the rehearsals progress and soon cannot stand the lines in the play.  He is a natural playwright and he has suggestions and insights as the play is re-done to David's astonishment.

A riot to watch and entertaining throughout, the laughs keep on coming.",1269734400,4,1048,4.842696629213483
651879,5,6303430546,"David Shayne (John Cusack) is an artist. He tells his agent, Julian Marx (Jack Warden), that he wants to direct his latest play himself, because he doesn't want another director to desecrate his words. He feels that his previous plays were destroyed by hack directors. Julian says that he just can't get it financed--unless he casts a stage struck gun moll for one of the parts. Her gangster boyfriend will then be willing to finance it. Shayne reluctantly agrees, when he hears that they can get the great Helen Sinclair (Dianne Wiest) to star.

Helen was a great actress in her heyday but lately she is known more for adultery and alcoholism. Her agent, Sid Loomis (Harvey Fierstein), tries to get the diva to see the light:

------------------
Helen Sinclair: Look, I haven't had a drink since New Year's Eve.
Sid Loomis: You're talking Chinese New Year's.
Helen Sinclair: Naturally. Still, that's two days, Sid! You know how long that is for me?
=========================

Sinclair agrees to do it, but has she reckoned on just how bad of an actress the ingnue would be? Olive Neal (Jennifer Tilly) is absolutely the worst actress to ever walk onto a stage:

----------------------
Olive: Don't tell me you still think the world revolves around...
Stage Manager: You.
Olive: ...you.
==================================

As if that weren't enough, she has been assigned a bodyguard who makes certain that none of her lines get cut. Cheech (Chazz Palminteri) is looking out for Olive, but after a while he starts to offer suggestions about the play. David Shayne bristles at taking suggestions from some strong-arm man with an IQ of minus 50, but the ideas work, and soon he is seeking Cheech's help.

And there you have the premise for Woody Allen's Bullets Over Broadway. If the ideas are a little trite it comes alive, paradoxically, because of the excellent execution. Bottom line is that unless you hate Woody Allen films on principle you'll like this one. The supporting cast is excellent, and let me just mention Jim Broadbent, Tracey Ullman, Rob Reiner (Meathead), and Mary Louise-Parker.
Cusack, as the writer/director, is actually a little flat and underplayed--but that's all the better to allow the rest of the cast to shine. In fact, Chazz Palminteri and Jennifer Tilly were both nominated for supporting Oscars; while Dianne Wiest won a well deserved supporting Oscar.

Jennifer Tilly with her trademark squeaky voice plays a bad actress so well that it makes you wonder: maybe she just IS a bad actress. But no one could be that bad. Paradoxically, she must therefore be a very good actress whose forte is playing bad singers and actresses. Tilly had a small but pivotal role as a bad singer in The Fabulous Baker Boys. I'd like to see her stretch her range and play a good singer or actress--or something--instead of always being typecast as clueless about her utter lack of talent, but she does it so well. It's hard to argue with success.

I have seen Chazz Palminteri be both brilliant (in Hurlyburly as the psychopathic out-of-work actor, Phil) and not-so-good (in Jade and Mulholland Falls). Here he shows that Hurlyburly wasn't just a fluke. Chazz has the chops to play a gangster thug who's actually sensitive and intelligent enough to be a writer. Did I mention that it was a comedy? Palminteri pulls off the drama, but doesn't stint on the comedy:

------------
Cheech: They taught me how to read and write in school before I burned it down.
David Shayne: You burned down your school?
Cheech: Yeah, it was Lincoln's birthday. There was nobody there.
====================

Finally, Dianne Wiest is an absolute hoot as the flamboyant alcoholic actress Helen Sinclair. I knew she was capable of greatness when I first saw her in Edward Scissorhands, and she also puts in a strong performance in Synecdoche, New York. In Bullets Over Broadway she really pulls out all the stops:

---------------
Helen Sinclair: Make love to me.
David Shayne: Here? Now?
Helen Sinclair: I see no reason to wait.
David Shayne: Jerome Kern is on the other side of the door.
Helen Sinclair: Yes, he's a wonderful composer. You'll have to meet him. Now hang up your pants.

651884,4,6303430546,"In general I have not liked any movie with Woody Allen in it but I do love his  humorous lines.  This movie is good in that Woody does not appear in it in person but he is there in spirit (for all that he is also an excellent saxophonist and film maker). So although it would not pass as a really great film Bullets over Broadway is, nonetheless,  a  highly entertaining and memorable  melodrama, American  humour at its best, replete  with  characters who are  seemingly funny  without  knowing it. As in Shakespeare's dramas  even the minor characters like the mafia boss's maid, get to utter wonderfully witty comments. Thankfully the only truly annoying character, I shan't tell you which one, gets whacked.

I wish some Amazon reviewers would not spoil it for others by revealing the two twists in this otherwise simple tale where the  mafia is mixed up with Broadway theatre via  a struggling  and unsuccessful  playwright's ambitions. The beauty of the whole thing is mostly in the lines. They  are delivered in the machine-gun staccato style of the old Marx brothers  movies and 1930s  comedies such as My Man Godfrey. This might pose difficulties for anyone viewing the movie at the cinema, particularly those unfamiliar with heavy New York accents (I personally find them as challenging as  the Scottish-English spoken in Glasgow). I taped the movie from a recent local TV airing, fortunately from a channel that  doesn't  interrupt with too many commercials, but I think the best idea is to buy or rent it in DVD form where at least when stuck one can switch  on English sub-titles, the  Greek subtitles translation on my tape  were so poor they didn't help.

The humour in the lines must not be missed because they are what  have distinguished this movie from many other so-called comedies. The cinematography and casting  is good, actually excellent. As well as the  period setting and costumes which really make you believe you are in a New York of the 1930s or late 1920s. I still think it would have  been even better as a stage production rather than a movie. If I were a stage producer I would use the full space of a theatre so that any actor playing Cheech would actually be sitting in the back row behind the audience. I give this film  a good rating because it is so thoroughly  entertaining, after all  for me  that is mainly what watching movies is all about.",1209340800,2,2383,4.673913043478261
651885,5,6303430546,"Apparently, as long as it involves a New York City scenario Woody Allen is more than happy to take a run at a plot that involves that locale in some way. Here it is the Great White Way- Broadway during its heyday in the Prohibition Era 1920's that gets his attention (Broadway was also the subject of his classic Broadway Danny Rose). What really makes this plot line very, very funny and makes the film work however is the plot twist of interspersing semi-serious production of a play with nefarious (and deadly) gangster activity.

Here a struggling (weren't they all and presumably still are) Greenwich Village writer has a thoughtful dramatic play in search of a backer and as the story progresses a gangster `ghostwriter'. Presto, up comes one backer-with a problem- his `doll' wants in on the play and (on the side) he needs to stay one or two steps ahead of his gangster rivals. These antics drive the play nicely as does a brilliant performance by Diane Wiest doing a fantastic send up of Gloria Swanson as the has-been actress searching for a comeback in Billy Wilder's classic Hollywood Boulevard. This one is definitely the five stars, with no hype needed. See it.",1204070400,5,1175,4.7317073170731705

The whole movie skewers, borrows and ultimately pays tribute to dramatic theater to delightful effect.  The scenes with John Cusack and secret love interest Diane Wiest could've been ripped right out of a 20's melodrama.  The shots are long and the cutting sparse lending even more to that theatrical feel.  However you don't need a lot of quick cuts to sell your movie when the dialog itself is quick and cutting.

Beautiful written, shot and directed, the story speeds along cleverly with twists and turns and plenty of humor. The performances by everyone in the cast are superb.

651969,4,6303430546,"For the most part, you can fit each of Woody Allen's movies into one of three categories:  serious drama, dark comedy, or light comedy.  ""Bullets Over Broadway"" definitely falls into the third category.  Though some critics have suggested there are allusions to Allen's own life and beliefs (a recurring them is that an artist makes his own moral code), the movie mostly ignores the darker, philosophical things that Allen typically covers in his more introspective comedies.

""Bullets Over Broadway"" is the story of a struggling playwright from Pittsburgh (John Cusack).  In order to get his play financed in New York, he accepts funding from a gangster and in turn casts his talent-less girlfriend (Jennifer Tilly) in a major roll.  As an added bonus, he has to deal with her bodyguard (who takes an interest in the play) and troublesome actors.  The leading man has a constantly expanding waistline, the leading lady is a manipulative, alcoholic has-been (played excellently by Diane Wiest), and Tracy Ullman plays temperamental supporting actress with a yapping dog.

As a writer, Allen is at his best when he's dealing with darker subject matter, but that doesn't mean he's not capable of creating a flawless, sophisticated comedy when he wants.  ""Bullets Over Broadway"" is probably too fluffy to be considered among Allen's best, but it's definitely in that second tier, along with ""Zelig"" and ""Radio Days.""  In terms of tone, it's probably most significant to ""Manhattan Murder Mystery,"" although Allen doesn't make an appearance in this film.",1176768000,,1550,5.164
651970,4,6303430546,"Set in 1920's New York City, ""Bullets over Broadway"" (1994) tells the story of a young playwright David Shayne who tries to produce his first play. He ""stands on the brink of greatness. The world will open to him like an oyster. No... not like an oyster. The world will open to him like a magnificent vagina"" but he needs to find money for production first.

The money comes from the gangster Nick Valenti on one condition - Nick's stunningly untalented bimbo girlfriend Olive (""She ruins everything she's in. She ruins things she's not even in"") has to play a psychiatrist. Olive is accompanied to each rehearsal by hit-man/bodyguard Cheech who knows how the real people talk and turned to be a greater writer than David. David's leading man, Warner Purcell eats compulsively every time he gets nervous (and there are plenty of reasons for him to get nervous). David's relationship with the girlfriend Ellen suffers when he begins an affair with the talented leading lady Helen Sinclair (""I'm still a star. I never play frumps or virgins."") who is ""in the last couple of years... better known as an adulteress and a drunk.""

""Bullets over Broadway"" is one of my favorite comedies by one of the favorite directors/writers, Woody Allen (I love you Woody, always have, always will - please make your gems, and I will be there to watch them). It has everything I look for in a comedy - brilliance, wit, clever writing, hilarious and sinister twist in the plot, amazing performances, authentic feel of the era and great musical score. ""Bullets over Broadway"" is pure delight from the beginning to the end. The best I could describe the film - to paraphrase the famous line from John F. Kennedy's Inaugural Address: ""Ask not what Art can do for you -- ask what you can do for Art"".

651974,5,6303430546,"Bullets Over Broadway is an extraordinary comedy directed by Woody Allen (Annie Hall) and starring a hilarious cast including John Cusack (Say Anything), Dianne Wiest (Footloose), Jennifer Tilly (Liar Liar), Chazz Palminteri (A Bronx Tale), Rob Reiner (Sleepless In Seattle), Jim Broadbent (Iris), Mary Louise Parker (The Client), and Jack Warden (Night And The City).

Cusack plays David Shayne, a struggling 1920's playwright who finally wraps up a new script. He's able to convince a has-been actress Helen Sinclair, played by Wiest in her Oscar winning role, and a distinguished English actor Warner who has a huge appetite, played by Broadbent. The only way that David will be able to have his play hit broadway is if he allows a gangster's lover Olive, played by Tilly, who proves to be a terrible actress. Just when David thinks things are going bad, Olive's gangster bodyguard Cheech, played hysterically by Palminteri, interferes with David's script and demands to make changes, while Warner and Olive begin a secret affair.

The film's comedic approach and Woody Allen's brilliant directing and screenplay makes Bullets Over Broadway a splendid film, and one of the best comedies of the past 15 years.

  Woody Allen's vision here takes on an interface of commercial theatre, Runyonesque gangsters (though closer to the Sopranos than ""Guys And Dolls"")and Greenwich Village intellectuals (Think about Dave Van Ronk reminiscing about the San Remo in Scorsese's ""No Direction Home"" or the lighter side of ""Reds."").

651978,5,6303430546,"`Bullets Over Broadway' by Woody Allen proves that one of Allen's strengths as a writer is in conceiving of implausible premises such as `Zelig', `Purple Rose of Cairo', and this movie and making them seem very real, and in building some very big jokes out of the situation. I believe this is the first movie done after the very messy breakup with Mia Farrow and the scandal with their young adopted daughter. This coincides with a change in studio with the move to Miramax and a relatively fresh crop of actors. While Allen's work seems much fresher after the somewhat weak `Shadows and Fog', there seems to be no inhibitions from the Weinsteins of Miramax on Allen's style. Aside from an executive producer added to the masthead, joining Rollins and Joffre, there is little change in Allen's senior creative team and the movie seems to be as fresh or fresher than Allen has been for a while.

In some ways, the plot is a parody of 1940's film noir renditions of 1920's gangsters, with Chazz Palminteri and Joe Viterelli playing up the Sicilian goodfellas roles as if they just stepped out of a Martin Scorsese flick. Harvey Fierstein also basically plays his stock flaming gay supporting role famously exercised in the movie `Independence Day'. Tracy Ullman also plays a familiar toy dog toting semifamous Broadway actress, contrasting well against Dianne Wiest's rendition of the lead character straight out of `Sunset Boulevard', the fading star who is reluctant to take a part in a play by a new writer, in spite of three miserable flops in a row and no other prospects in the works. (Wiest won an Academy Award for best supporting actress for this performance). Jim Broadbent plays the male stereotype of a faded Broadway actor whose weakness, temporarily overcome, is food and his waistline. Jennifer Tilly is about as close as you can come to a female lead playing against all the talent shown by Wiest and Ullman, but she carries of the role of a classic dumb blond moll (to mob boss Viterelli) who wants to be an actress. Rob Reiner does well in a small part as an idealistic unpublished unperformed dramatist. Mary Louise Parker seems a bit wasted, although I'm sure she was not as well known in 1994 as she is now, after several seasons in an important guest role on `The West Wing'. Jack Warden is sort of the anchor to the film, reminding you that we are dealing with the business of producing a Broadway play. John Cusack has the nominal male lead, shared somewhat with Palminteri, as the struggling dramatist / director whose play is picked up by `godfather' Viterelli who underwrites the cost of the production in order to provide his girlfriend a role on Broadway.

Looked at sideways, the story may seem like an alternate take on the story of Elmore Leonard's `Get Shorty' with Palminteri in the Travolta role. In fact, Travolta would have made a great choice for Palminteri's part in `Bullets...'. But, it is really a very different brand of comedy, patented by Allen long before `...Shorty' was a gleam in Leonard's eye.

In many ways, once the basic premise is laid out, there is nothing very surprising about where the story goes. And, one develops relatively little empathy for any of the main characters, as you do for Mia Farrow's character in `Shadows and Fog' and `Purple Rose of Cairo', for example. But the road taken to get to the ending is filled with more than its share of funny moments. This may even be considered Allen's answer to Mel Brooks' `The Producers', although while `The Producers' is one of Brooks' two best movies, this is not among Allen's top five.

If one were to graph Allen's movie content for humor versus pathos, this would be among the highest in humor and lowest in pathos. It would certainly be one of his best-crafted recent movies.

Easily rewatchable. But, even with the change to Miramax, there are virtually no extras.",1117065600,2,3881,4.752225519287834
652039,5,6303430546,"Departing from the modern realism of 'Interiors,' 'Annie Hall,' and 'Hannah and Her Sisters,' director Woody Allen uses old-time, deliciously over-the-top Broadway to execute with brilliant precision themes concerning the artist, his art, and the motivation to create.

In a problematic but never unexciting performance, John Cusack is David Shayne, a play-write living in New York City in the midst of a stable relationship whilst directing a play found to be pretentiously unrealistic. He casts two generally wonderful actors, the melodramatic but passionate Helen Sinclair (a hilarious Dianne Wiest in a brilliant, Oscar-winning performance), and finally, a gangster's girlfriend, Olive Neal (Jennifer Tilly), who simply cannot act...at all. Every word she speaks is painfully bland and obnoxious, and she can't even recognize a few of the more complicated ones (she has a bit of trouble reading ""masochistic""). David has no choice but to cast her, though, lest he face the mob and/or lose all financial support for the play. In addition to her obnoxious...erm...stage presence, she brings along Cheech (Chazz Parliminteri), a body guard who often contradicts David's directorial decisions and dialogue.

This storyline could have easily been played off as farce. But under the hands of master auteur Allen, it is obvious that art, theme and credible side-splitting comedy are first and foremost on his mind at all times. Through dinner conversation, casual walks through a serene park, and wonderfully portrayed rehearsals, Allen harnesses this potentially absurd setting with a grace that allows emphasis on the crucial themes concerning all that surrounds an artist's yearning to capture life at its brightest and darkest moments.

Dianne Wiest's powerhouse of a comedic performance only strengthens the fluidity of the writing and direction. Her seductive Helen Sinclair not only overacts her lines, but also everyday expressions (whenever David attempts to say something self-doubting, she shoves her hands in his face, screaming, ""Don't...speak""). In addition to these hilarities, Wiest allows us to believe David began to fall for her. She injects a strong, luminous quality into Helen that could intoxicate the most impervious of hearts. Behind the cigarettes and the sparkling hats and dresses, Wiest developed a glowing gem of a human being who feels comfortably real.

Also notable was Chazz Paliminteri who successfully and convincingly began to shed Cheech's ""tough gangster"" persona to reveal a naturalistic talent for writing that clashed purposefully and appropriately with David's forced poeticism.

Despite some memorable performances and a well-written screenplay, 'Bullets' unfortunately concludes a little too easily. Fortunately, the tone is never monotonous and the laughs keep on coming. What's wonderful about Allen's comedy is that it doesn't feel contrived or trite at any point in time. Even when he plays with the dazzlingly over-expressive lights of old Broadway, whatever comes out of his characters' mouthes feels absolutely natural, and for the most part endearingly uproarious.",1093305600,15,3114,5.617021276595745

That would define Allen's genius when it comes to directing (romantic or un-romantic?) comedies. When it comes to casting, though, ""Bullets over Broadway"" must be the best of all, featuring the finest performance of every actor. Not only the credit must go to those in lead roles (John Cusack -- who played Woody Allen's would-be character, Dianne Wiest, Jack Warden, Jennifer Tilly), but the supporting cast was superb as well (with Tracy Ullman as Eden, Chazz Palmenterri as Cheech, Rob Reiner as Flender, Mary-Louise Parker as Ellen, and Stacey Nelkin -- Allen's ex-girldfriend -- as Rita).

John Cusack plays the Woody charector in this satire.  He is a cafe playwrite, who fails to turn up grasping story lines, and instead he produces rather heavy dramas.  So it is no surprise that his newest play does not appeal to his producer, but on a total chance, the playwrite finds an investor in gangster form.  There's one nitch however.  The playwrite must give a crucial role to the gangster's girlfriend, who's talent is substantialbly minimul.  And as the play is finnaly up in rolling, more problems surface.  Such as the playwrite's affair witht the vain prima donna, a leading actor with a terrible eating habbit, a supporting actress' yippy chiwawa, and many more.
Classic in Allen pics, Bullets Over Broadway shines as one of the best.

All the performers in the movie are exceptional, with special praise to Wiest and Tilly.  The dialogue is typically funny for an Allen film, and the plot moves along well.  The behind the scenes aspect of the film works very well, and Allen does an amazing job (along with the production team) of re-creating a 1930's atmosphere.

Heavy hitter stars work perfectly with one another, creating a hysterical comedy. Weiss, Cusak, Palmentarri, Reiner are all at their best.",1457740800,,274,5.111111111111111
