8396072,5,B003FQM4IM,"I have reviewed a lot of shooting videos over the many years of being sent materials to look over and this video production is very much to my liking.  It's good ole fashioned, common sense rifle shooting.  Many will say this is specifically geared to competitive shooting and for such participants.

Yet what is offered in the video series is solid basics, just as I was taught many years ago in the mountains of West Virginia and later in the military, and what I see making a come-back in tactical training with the new crop of former SF Operators, such as J.D. Potynsky of NORTHERN RED, for example, teaching military, law enforcement and civilian consumers today.

Much of what has come since the late 70's has been a kind of an in vogue, theoretical shooting, while this video presentation gets us back to the hard-core basics, with good, forward aggressive, balanced but fast and accurate shooting, from an off-hand shooting posture.

There is much more than just this above lessons in basic riflemanship. For example in the first disc we get lessons of proper muzzle/breech alignment on target, the proper stance, grip an trigger manipulations for the off-hand shooting posture.

The second disc explicates and demonstrates shooting multiple and moving targets, speed reloading, while the third disc gets into the nitty gritty of clearing malfunctions, shooting from behind barriers, shooting on the move and positional shooting.

The shooting lessons are all about learning to control our weapon by controlling our body and mind, developing the proficiency necessary for executing smooth motor skills with the weapon we choose to shoot.

I recommend this video series, and it will remain in my library as THE go-to-reference for sound, fundamental rifle shooting, be it for home defense, tactical operations, or basic marksmanship with a rifle.
