174187,5,0976865823,"As long as you can get past the less than stellar lighting & the questionable props this is an excellent DVD where pure content is concerned. It looks like it was filmed in about an hour by an someone holding a video camera & a set of lights. (Hope Joe is paying attention - would love to see him produced the way he deserves, but I'm glad he didn't let possible budget-restraints keep him from making this one.)

As for content, it is superb & well worth sitting through the poor production. I tend to put it on when I work so I can just listen to Dispenza. Most of the information he presents is quite technical & requires some concentration though, so I find listening to it over & over helps me assimilate something new each time.

I first noticed Dispenza in ""What the Bleep Do We Know?"" & latter purchased the ""Quantum Edition"" of this movie because it has hours & hours of additional interviews - & one of my favorites is of course Joe Dispenza. However, don't expect the same high-tech production work in this DVD as found in ""What the Bleep..."".

Dispenza is a chiropractor & did postgraduate training and continuing education in neurology, neurophysiology, and brain function. He is also a graduate of JZ Knight's School of Enlightenment, but he doesn't get into any Ramtha stuff here. (Although I wouldn't mind hearing his take on it.) He sticks to the physiological functions of the brain and is wonderful at explaining a very difficult topic. If you want to change existing negative patterns in your thinking, emotions and/or reactions, this is an excellent source of information on how you might accomplish this. Dispenza succinctly explains the how's and why's (explanations that are often left out in discussions of brain plasticity) that will help you understand the wonderful possibilities of your own brain.

I also recommend Dispenza's book, ""Evolve Your Brain"" which I found a bit dry and difficult to get through at first, but he also has a DVD by the same name (it's a great adjunct to this DVD - not a big-budget production either but a little more interesting to watch because he was filmed live, onstage before an audience.) Ultimately, both DVD's have helped me tremendously in understanding his book, which goes into much more depth and was well worth the effort.

Another source of information I highly recommend is a book called ""Heart Math"". The heart and brain are intrinsically linked, and changes in the brain can occur via focusing on the heart and learning to entrain the two. Heart Math teaches the fundamentals of `heart focus' like Dispenza teaches the fundamentals of `brain plasticity' - both of which can lead to a greater understanding of why we think, say and feel the things we do, and ultimately help us make changes to old, negative thinking patterns.

I applaud Joe Dispenza for his work in a very difficult subject and for making this information understandable to the lay person. Another favorite researcher and writer in the area of epigenetics is Dr. Bruce Lipton. His excellent book ""The Biology of Belief: Unleashing the Power of Consciousness, Matter, & Miracles"" - is a very easy read by comparison, but Joe Dispenza goes much further, with more in-depth teaching for those who want more.",1294358400,41,3244,4.794275491949911
174188,5,0976865823,This product is a wonderful uplifting DVD that I encourage everyone to have and use.  In my case he definitely activates/energizes the throat and third eye chalkra.  He has a way of putting his message into everyday language that anyone could understand and use.  I just wish he would do another one as a sequel and help me go to the next step.,1286064000,13,344,4.428571428571429
174189,5,0976865823,"This DVD is wonderful. The content is truly inspiring and believable. Who cares that the production values are minimal. It's tasteful, audible, and looks ok. It's the CONTENT! Amazing information for anyone wanting to make big changes in their life. It takes visualization and positive attitude/affirmation to a whole new level. Using the principles (easy) presented, I think mankind could evolve in an entirely different direction and manner. This totally blows the underpinnings of organized religion, that teaches us that we are inferior beings and can only be saved by some outside entity. Folks, the power is within us all.

Don't think this is new age hooie. This is actually how the brain and body work, in unison, together creating whatever we focus on. Just stunning in it's implications. Also, what's presented here is supported by so much other credible information. Dr. Bruce Lipton. Dr. Candace Pert. So many others.

I watch this DVD constantly for inspiration and sharp focus. Love it! You will to.",1282694400,22,1013,5.133333333333334
7794788,1,0976865823,I got this for a dollar at a book sale and still feel ripped off.  Joe never gives any scientific proof.  In fact he says scientists won't back him up.  He rambles on and tells stories based on hopes and illusions and never on facts.  There is no organization to his information so you won't come away from the 1 hour video with any actionable things you can do.  He never says a single thing about how you can master the art of observation.  Seems to me the title is false advertising.,1498867200,,486,4.228260869565218

7794791,5,0976865823,"Dr Joe is the best. His methods of describing the brain and it's functions, patterns and activities make the information so much easier to absorb. Thank you Joe Dispenza.",1379203200,,170,4.896551724137931
7794792,5,0976865823,enjoyed it. will watch it again and again. What's with the eighteen or more word description? I cant just rate it.,1372118400,,114,4.476190476190476
7794793,5,0976865823,"Another step upon the latter that is my mind. This movie shows me how to take a step back, while everyone else panics and make CONSCIOUS, CORRECT and CALCULATED moves. Everytime i watch or read something by hi, I walk away with a new gift. One from God. I am very graeful to Dr. Joe Dispenza. He has helped me ""Evolve My Brain"", (a few friends and my 4yr old genius nephew's as well) and guided me to a life of calm...",1360281600,,418,4.109756097560975
7794794,4,0976865823,"Dr. Dispenza asked the question: ""What do the people who have had spontaneous remissions to major diseases have in common?""  He goes on to explain several things he found.  I won't give them all away here, but it was worth listening to.  He sat in front of a colorful wallpapered wall and discussed it, but there were no ""visual illustrations"" so common and wonderful in this type of documentary.",1356566400,,396,4.7101449275362315
7794795,5,0976865823,"Dr. Joe jumps right in and give you volumes of information in every sentence. This video, it would seem to me is to help reinforce the concepts of Mastering the art of observation. There is no magic pill that is going to suddenly give you all the answers or make you understand or even learn this information. You, yourself have to be hungry for it and change your own logic of reality.",1339632000,,386,4.375
7794796,5,0976865823,"This is one of my favourite DVDs that summarises everything I have been studying for the past 15 years.  I absolutley love Dr Joe and the way he makes everything sound so simple and logical, even when he is speaking about leading edge concepts and frontier science.  Why do so many of us limit our lives based on theories and concepts that are hundreds of years old? I don't know about you, but life is way more exciting and fun when I focus my attention on the unknown and stand on the edge of possibility.  I have a degree in Veterinary Science and have also spent over 15 years studying yoga and meditation and everything that Dr Joe says rings true for me from both perspectives.  I love his work! Thanks Dr Joe :o)",1329177600,7,719,4.343283582089552
7794797,4,0976865823,"Yes, the content is great and Joe's a captivating speaker. Still, I remain disappointed. Why on earth not do this project properly? Why on earth not locate people with the skills to film? to edit? to light? to provide some graphics? The seriously substandard presentation is disconcerting - sound bouncing in and out, lights flashing randomly... I mean come on, if you've got something IMPORTANT AND LEADING EDGE TO EXPRESS (and the concepts presented here are), then go to the trouble to express it (verbally, visually, auditorily..) well. There's no reason not to. Budget-smudget - just do the thing properly.",1327795200,6,611,5.12
