7879627,5,6304834403,"This video features Luciano Pavarotti in the role which could not be perfect for Pavarotti's voice. The question is how can pure lyrical voice of Pavarotti handle the title role of ""Pagliaci"". Listen and watch this video and you going to find out how. I tell you more: Pavarotti is not simply handling the role, he brings such an excitment, such a dramatism to the role that I personally could not imagine. I never knew that singing like this could be possible. His ""Vesti La giubba"" is not as great as Del Monaco's but listen, listen to him in the last scene, what he does is beyond imagination, he is 100 percent involved in the opera, his eyes are full of hate and despair and his last ""La comedia e finita"" followed by dramatic melody performed by orchestra is really something that makes you freeze for a moment and then cry, cry till the end. And when audience applouses to Teresa Stratas, she is pointing to big Pavarotti and her eyes are saying: ""This is him who should you applouse, not me, I am nothing compared to him"", but Teresa Stratas is really something on this tape. She is unbelievable Nedda, I think Nedda is the best role she ever sung. Her duet with Silvio (with Croft, who also is splendid) is full of love and passion, Juan Pons is great Tonio.
In the second part Domingo is featured, who is also magnificent with Stratas and Pons, but the main thing on this tape is PAVAROTTI. This is must have, do not hesitate! 5 stars if not more.",1004486400,3,1457,4.440298507462686
