8383812,5,B002XRBDBI,"Great Story, Great Plot! But 2nd half has very Poor English subtitles!  translated from Korean into Chinese than a Chinese person  translated the Chinese subtitles into poor English that doesn't make any Sense.  In Asian Languages (Chinese, Korean and Japanese) they say things backwards. Instead of I'm going to the store. They say ""Me Store Go"". So the English subtitles are all backwards.

Great story! Jewel In the Palace is arguably the first successful historical feminist drama, retelling Jang Geum's rice-to-riches story during the Chosun Dynasty 500 years ago. Jewel is the real story of Jang Geum, (Starring Lee Young-ae) a young girl who is the first woman to become the King's supreme royal physician in a male-dominated society. Behind her child-like eyes lies an ambitious working girl with a 21st century mindset. See how Jang Geum goes from being a virtually abandoned child to maid, to cook and than finally becoming the King's doctor. Which is unheard of as it was a male dominated profession at the time. This unforgettable drama of epic proportions tells the touching and tear-jerking story of a true underdog.
Great Plot!  ""Jewel in the Palace"" is based on a True Story about a legendary girl (Jang-Geum) who after much struggle and heartbreak became the first woman of the Chosun Dynasty to be the supreme royal physician.  In a time when women held little influence in society, young apprentice cook Jang-geum strives to learn the secrets of Korean cooking and medicine in order to cure the King of his various ailments.

10th highest rated Korean drama of all time. Produced for US$15 million, it was later exported to 91 countries and has earned US$103.4 million worldwide, becoming known as one of the primary proponents of the Korean Wave by heightening the popularity of Korean Pop Culture abroad.

Created by Kim Yeong-Hyeon and Directed by Kim Keun Hong.

8383814,4,B002XRBDBI,When I read the reviews for volume 3 I almost didn't watch it.  I am so glad I did!  I love these DVD's.  I couldn't see much difference in the translation from the first two.  In fact I think the vocabulary was a little more advanced than the first two.  Translation was a little funny sometimes but that didn't bother me.  I hope the negative reviews won't stop others from watching this. I couldn't wait to sit down and watch another episode. I was sorry when it ended.,1301184000,,472,4.306818181818182
8383815,3,B002XRBDBI,"After watching the ""Grand Chef"", a Korean Drama intermixed with a cooking show on PBS, we told our friends at church about how great it was & they gave us a 9 disc set of ""Dae Jang Geum"". We were told that it was like the ""Grand Chef"" but based more on history. We put the 1st DVD in, watched, & were hooked. For the past week we have been watching a DVD per night. Never have we been glued to such fantastic scenery & costumes, with a gripping plot that forces you to continue past your bed time. The screen writers were very talented showing Dae Jung Geum's life of 16th century Korean entry as palace kitchen maid to become the greatest female doctor within a semi-fictional account yet climaxing plot at each chapter ending. The whole series reveals Korean culture & history to a fine degree. Writing all this yet to rate the DVD set with a 3 may look very questionable. The answer: the sub-tiles are bizarre, misspelled, sometimes under the wrong character, even when the characters are silent...they must be direct translations with no concern for the normal structure of English. The DVD set starts out with semi-normal English but sometimes misses the correct placement of verbs to nouns. It's like reading English within a Latin grammar structure. Other times the sub-titles use the wrong pronoun, or mis-spell a word, but then the problem goes beyond this with disc 7 to 9. Talking to some Chinese friends that have the Chinese translation version of this DVD set, we came to the conclusion that the last 3 DVD's must be translated literally from Chinese, maybe from a computer software system? For example: the sub-title word ""Is"" is used in place of ""Yes"" which is true in the Chinese language. The sub-title word ""Adult"" is used in place of ""Sir"" or a pronoun lacking either person or gender reference. In other words: when we see a certain amount of Adults in a screen, & someone says ""Adult"", you don't know which Adult the word Adult refers to. Also the names or the titles of the characters change without the buyer ever being informed. In the first 6 discs everyone's name is in Korean as in ""Jang Geum"" but in the last 3 discs is replace as ""Long Now"". Other names of characters change to titles as in ""Still Temple"" or to their meaning of names as in ""Concern to Live"". In other words I was trying to think what the sub-title ""Long Now"" was & couldn't see anything in the scene that was long & in the present. With the sub-title ""Still Temple"" I was looking for some temple in the background or waiting for the characters to walk to a temple not knowing that they were talking about the Overseer of the kitchen. In one section I keep seeing Jang Geum asking people ""Concern to Live"" as if she was saying ""Hello"", but she was asking ""Where is the person who name means Concern for Live?"" If you want something good to watch & can overlook this major flaw, this set is a lot cheaper then what maybe in the other issue of 3 separate DVD's.",1294963200,2,2956,4.486085343228201
8383816,1,B002XRBDBI,"After the first few episodes, the English sub-titles are so bad that one cannot understand what's going on. The sub-titles turn a beautiful TV drama into a hee hee comedy.

I know some better sub-titled versions exist, because I've seen snippets on the net. This version ought to be sold as *NOT* having English sub-titles.",1290211200,8,323,4.872727272727273
8383817,2,B002XRBDBI,The previous reviewer was being kind. The first half of the tapes were fine for English only viewers but the 2nd half was completely and I mean completely unintelligible. They changed caption writers and the 2nd one had absolutely no idea about English. The Chinese sub-titles were good throughout though. Do NOT buy if you only speak English you will be completely devastated that you could not follow what was obviously a wonderful series. The producers of the discs should be ashamed.,1266278400,14,487,4.951219512195122
8383818,2,B002XRBDBI,"The Jewel in the Palace is a Korean drama based on the life of a young woman who became a Physician to the King, a remarkable feat for women of the era. It is beautifully acted, the costumes and filming is superb.
Unfortunately this particular edition is let down by poor subtitles.  In the 1-6 discs the subtitles are understandable with some concentration but in discs 7 - 9 the English subtitling is completely unintelligable. An example of this:
""Is, say that is have problems inside the person who the food poisoning. Elephant words too not till the vegetableses that now ate have never type of matter"" (transcribed directly)
If you speak Korean Fluently then this single DVD set is a bargain, costing substantially less than the three separate DVD sets of Jewel in the Palace which are available. However if you rely on English subtitles then this DVD set will not meet your expectations.",1266278400,10,894,4.767741935483871
