Movie: Movie is very slow. It tries to show how the Japanese can not say no to anything. It is about 4 people. One guys gets both girls. One guy gets none. So the entire movie is about how the guy treats the girl and how the respond to the way they are treated. Probably could have been a 30 minute film. DVD film is 1-2 stars",1395446400,,565,3.956140350877193
