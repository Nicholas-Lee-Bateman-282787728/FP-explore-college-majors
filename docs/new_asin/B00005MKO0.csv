7946002,5,B00005MKO0,"I wish this was a book.  There is love, betrayal, fantasy, loyalty, death, a quest, and a mystery.  All in this series.  I had to get all of the volumes and watched it several times.  I think this story was somewhat based on a Japanese folk tale about an angel that was ""captured"" and forced to stay on earth.  This story takes place in modern Japan, but the roots begin in old Japan.  The English dubbing was very well done.  The voices used for the characters are well suited for their personalities--Tommy Campbell--wow! If you'd like to see a part of the dvd before buying, check it out on YouTube.  The music from the dvd is also beautiful.",1258502400,,645,4.406779661016949
7946003,4,B00005MKO0,"When we left off last volume, Aya had just transformed into Ceres, the celestial being, after her mother tried to kill her. The mysterious red-haired Toya has also shown up to capture her, even though he seems to have feelings for Aya. Ceres swears to destroy the Mikage family, which includes Aki, Aya's brother, who just happens to be the reincarnation of the man that stole her celestial robe, which kept her from returning to Heaven. Unfortunately, the brother that she loves can do nothing to help Aya's personality reemerge, because Ceres' hate is so strong. It's up to Yuhi to change her back to Aya, and he does so by kissing her! The main villain, Aya's cousin, begins to assert himself in this volume. He wants to harness the power of Ceres for a secret project and is willing to harm Aya to get to Ceres.

I really like this show so far. I've never been impressed with Viz's 3 episode count on their anime though. To me, it's just not a good value. While there are a lot of mysteries, including Toya's anime cliche missing memories, the show is pretty clear in terms of plot and is never confusing. I like the characters even though most of the males mostly talk in quiet seductive tones, trying too hard to be the strong and silent type. The animation is pretty good, but the music could use some work. With Volume 2, I am even more intrigued with how all these conflicts are going to work out and I look forward to the next installment.",1158969600,,1449,4.467924528301887

7946005,5,B00005MKO0,I'm happy to see even more characters introduced. I can never tell what happens next. This series just draws me in. Highly recommended!!!,1013385600,3,137,5.0
7946006,5,B00005MKO0,"Well, I don't usually do these, but the previous review is a bit off, and I figured it may need some correcting...
Ayashi no Ceres is a wonderful series.  If you've noticed the Roman name of Demeter is used to name the Tennyo(which can be translated as heavenly maiden, the subtitling calls her an angel), I can't recall whether it plays an extremely important part, but the legend is actually a true legend in Japan, I believe... In which Ceres' Hagaromo(robe) is kept from her by the fisherman who is later called Shiso, I believe...which is something akin to ""ancestor""... Anyway, I don't want to give it away...there are huuuge surpises in the end, and throughout the series you can expect to be completely confused and lossed if you don't pay close attention.
However, I don't really suggest seeing this just because you like Fushigi Yuugi.  While the men are designed similiarly, and have the staple of Watase-sensei's brillian art, the plot is a lot more violent, sexual, and controversial...If you are extremely disturbed by insestuous references, and attempted stuff like that, do not see this.
It's also considerably more violent, and from what I saw on the first DVD, doesn't do the shoujo barbie doll nudity thing.  There's also sex and the like...soooo, watch with discretion.
If you DO enjoy those things, then by all means,  WATCH this anime!  It has gorgeous animation, beautiful bishounens, riveting story lines, fast action, romance, heartbreaking scenes, and CHOPSTICKS!  YES!  Any man who fights with chopsticks is for ME!  And if you reeeally like my Su-chan from FY, than watch this! Because Yuuhi with his headband on looks like grown up Suboshi! ::coos:: So gorgeous!  And Touya, and Aki, and Wei, andandand Okay....just GO SEE!  ::falls over::",997488000,8,1768,4.982993197278912
7946007,5,B00005MKO0,"Ceres is a great ceres based on the manga by Yu Watase. It is about a girl named Aya Mikage who on her 16th birthday finds out that she is a descendant of Ceres. Ceres is a godess(I think) who's robe was stolen by a fisherman. She needed the robe to get back to Heaven and couldn't because he had it. So she married him and they had children(hence, Aya being a descendant). Well, she swears revenge. On Aya's birthday, her whole family assembles. They do a test to see if Ceres blood runs in her. It does and they try to kill her(some family) but she gets away. to complicate it more The fisherman's blood runs in Aki her twin brother. This series is beautifully animated and I recommend it to anyone who liked Fushigi Yugi.",995241600,4,724,4.291970802919708
