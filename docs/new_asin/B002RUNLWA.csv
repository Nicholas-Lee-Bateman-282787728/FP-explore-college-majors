3976047,3,B002RUNLWA,I wish this movie elaborated more regarding her life and relationship with Jesus.  The movie was okay.  Any movie about saints I find interesting.,1360713600,,146,5.041666666666667
3976048,4,B002RUNLWA,"In this short film, you learn the suffering and relationship she shared with Christ. It is well worth the money.",1356220800,,112,4.65
3976049,1,B002RUNLWA,This movie came off really fake. Very poor acting. Probably a lovely story but I couldn't watch it because it was so badly done.,1354579200,,128,4.375
3976050,1,B002RUNLWA,I was not at all happy with this movie. I love her true story but this really is a B movie. Very disappointing.,1350432000,,111,3.869565217391304
3976051,5,B002RUNLWA,"At only 35 minutes long, this is a brief film. Yet it feels the perfect length of time to tell the story of an unlearned maid who became a nun, who became a saint. With great simplicity and grace, the essentials of Saint Faustina's story are told, from the day she arrived at the convent, to the day she died. Apparently one day a simple country girl heard a voice telling her that God wanted her to become a nun. A few convents turned her down until one convent agreed to let her in. From there, Sister Faustina was given everyday domestic chores such as cooking a huge pot of soup. Soon, she began to have visions. The news of these visions was not met with excitement by all. Some were very skeptical. Sister Faustina had to have medical and psychological tests. In the end all believed.

The Divine Mercy chaplet and painting, told to Sister Faustina by Jesus in a vision, are today known to Roman Catholics as instrumental to all people as a sign of God's Mercy and Grace. Roman Catholics believe those instruments of God's Mercy have saved many souls.

At the end of this short film, there is footage of Pope John Paul II honoring Sister Faustina in Vatican Square.

The quality of this film can seem a bit low budget at times, for instance in a bad wig here or an extra-actor looking at the camera, there. But overall the quality is very good. The acting is very good.

Well worth a rental for any faith filled Catholic.",1346803200,6,1427,4.414448669201521
3976052,1,B002RUNLWA,"I tried to really like this but it fails in several ways.

Having read St. Faustina's diary (Divine Mercy in my soul) and studied Divine Mercy for several years, we found several inaccuracies; although one may say they are minor, there is no excuse on why they are not accurate.

For example, Jesus asked St. Faustina to paint the image of Divine Mercy while she was in her cell, not while she was cleaning floors.  Also, when Jesus asks her for the image, she was overwhelmed and concerned; the demeanor the protagonist displays in this movie is not in line with the disposition of a saint.  Sisters don't wear make-up, nor do they keep their hair when they are professed.

I do believe the intention was good, but it falls short.",1334448000,3,731,4.549618320610687
3976053,1,B002RUNLWA,This is not a reverent representation of the life of Faustina.  Did not like it.,1278892800,7,80,4.333333333333333
3976054,2,B002RUNLWA,Poorly poorly acted... Wasted money,1441497600,,35,6.2
3976055,3,B002RUNLWA,Story was accurate as I remember it,1440892800,,35,4.142857142857143
3976056,1,B002RUNLWA,The English sub titles were too sparse.  I was unable to keep up with the story line.  This would be a good film for Polish speaking people.  Other than that it was beautifully filmed.,1428278400,,184,4.352941176470588
3976057,3,B002RUNLWA,"Ok, it's not the best movie but it does provide some background to St. Faustina. I wish they could have expanded the movie to 60 minutes and gave more details.",1426636800,,159,4.333333333333333
3976058,3,B002RUNLWA,Its short and yes rather amateurish but still its heart is in the right place.  Should have been more detailed but it is what it is and still a nice short film.,1426204800,,160,4.0
3976059,1,B002RUNLWA,Played horribly.  The actress does not seem to be virtuous at all.  Made with minimal effort,1421280000,,92,4.6875
3976060,1,B002RUNLWA,"A poor representation of St. Faustina especially if you've read her Diary.  Her true spirituality is not portrayed and the sisters with whom she lives are portrayed as angry, bitter women who are far from pious.  There are better movies out there that delve into the Divine Mercy story much more accurately.",1420848000,4,307,4.884615384615385
3976061,5,B002RUNLWA,"This is a movie about St. Faustina and the Divine Mercy. I have read her diary and this movie brings to life how clearly our life can be a continuous dialogue with the Lord, whose Mercy is infinite and transcends any earthly understanding of it. This movie is also about the gift of the Divine Mercy which is being offered to all men - our Lord has called all people to return; His Mercy is His greatest attribute. This message is a final message before His Day of Justice. Let us trust in His Mercy and amend our lives because no man knows the hour of the coming of that final moment.",1418083200,6,585,4.232142857142857
3976062,4,B002RUNLWA,Very interesting book. I enjoyed reading it and thinking about the contents.,1413504000,,76,5.416666666666667
3976063,5,B002RUNLWA,To brief. But worth a look. The message is very critical.,1411257600,,57,4.2727272727272725

3976065,1,B002RUNLWA,"This was awful. The acting was terrible, and the story was not good or clear as to what the message was. It left out so much, except to pray the Chaplet.",1410048000,,153,3.967741935483871
3976066,3,B002RUNLWA,"Very disappointed.  Was. hoping for a longer, more in-depth movie.  I also didn't know nuns wore such heavy makeup.  I feel it was one-sided.",1409356800,,141,4.791666666666667
3976067,5,B002RUNLWA,Great but not sure if it is purely Catholic.,1406764800,,44,4.0

3976070,1,B002RUNLWA,"$15.00 for a 30 minute disappointment? I expected this to be a staple that we'd watch again and again, but once was too much. I kept waiting for the movie to get off the ground but it never does, at all.  Nothing about the movie speaks of the marvel that St. Faustina is. It's just a boring and dull disappointment.",1392422400,2,315,4.25
3976071,1,B002RUNLWA,"Events in St. Faustina's life not accurately presented, emphasis on lack of kindness from her Sisters, poor acting. No sense of the beauty and power of Divine Mercy. Don't waste your money.",1381190400,,189,4.9375
3976072,2,B002RUNLWA,Did not go much in depth about the saints life. Very short story. Poor acting as well. It was done at some school as a project.,1371945600,,127,3.923076923076923
3976073,3,B002RUNLWA,This is about one of most beloved Saints.  Feel it could have been done with more thought and finance especially the costumes where awful.,1364083200,,138,4.75
8378868,1,B002RUNLWA,"Ordered this to show something new at our Divine Mercy Sunday event. I have lead a Divine Mercy Group for 6 years. Was so disappointed when I watched it and will not use it. The facts of St. Faustina's life were not accurate. The acting was poor and the story jumped from one part of her story to another without bridges. For someone unfamiliar with her story, they would be very confuses and not understand the full power of what Jesus did in giving her the message of Divine Mercy. Very sad...",1521504000,,495,4.391304347826087

8378872,5,B002RUNLWA,Amazing and inspiring.  Also hopeful,1476403200,,36,6.2

8378874,2,B002RUNLWA,Had high hopes for this movie. Then realized it was only half an hour and poorly acted. They could have really made this a good movie if they tried. Very disappointed. Save your money.,1468800000,,184,4.4411764705882355
