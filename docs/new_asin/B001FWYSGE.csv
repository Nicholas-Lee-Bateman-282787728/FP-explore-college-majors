Although the package was sealed number three movie was missing !!! simply the box was empty without dvd which I realized after a while I bought the whole thing SO....",1377561600,,284,4.568627450980392
8302926,4,B001FWYSGE,"I'm so glad and a little surprised that these classics have finally found their way onto DVD at last. I know how good and important
these films were as I was one of the early pioneers of the VHS/Betamax film rental revolution back in the late 70's early 80's in the UK.
Lemon Popsicle which followed with Going Steady and Hot Bubblegum were some of the most popular titles of that era.
The UK distributor at the time was Hokushin and later Guild Home, must have wondered why these titles were so popular. They flew off the shelves.
But they just struck a chord with the public even though they were apparently dubbed films made in Israel. Who would have thought.
Funny and poignant,films with a cult following don't come better than these classics and stand the test of time.",1338163200,6,775,4.542857142857143
