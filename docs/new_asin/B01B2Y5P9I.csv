8749188,3,B01B2Y5P9I,"This is a collection of five previously released operas in their original DVD cases. The cases are housed in a thin cardboard box. The operas are:

BORIS GODUNOV-Mussorgsky 2010  (3.9 stars)
Orlin Anastassov is Boris Godunov. Pr Lindskog is Grigory the Pretender. Peter Bronder is Prince Shuisky. Evgeny Akimov is the Holy Fool. Gianandrea Noseda conducts the Orchestra of the Teatro Regio, Turin.
This is the original 1869 version, with only the ""Kromy forest"" scene from Mussorgsky's 1872 version added. No other revisions are included.
The singing is generally excellent. The acting is outstanding. The costumes are excellent. The minimalist scenery sometimes supports the starkness of the story, but this is an opera that needs its scenery to help establish where and when the story takes place. Someone new to this opera would be hindered in following the storyline.

EUGENE ONEGIN-Tchaikovsky 2011  (1.0 star)
Bo Skovhus is Eugene Onegin. Andrej Dunaev is Lensky. Krassimira Stoyanova is Tatyana. Mariss Jansons conducts the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra.
The stage presentation is generally very pleasing to the eye. The costumes are appealing although many do not belong in this opera. The music is well done. The stark modern scenery robs the story of its Russian roots, or indeed of any roots.
The widely varied conclusions of the customer reviews are typical for this kind production. People who wished to see Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin were disappointed because this is not Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin. The music is his, but the original story has been ground up, smothered in visual puzzles and turned into something previously unknown. Someone unfamiliar with this opera would have no chance of comprehending the story's original plot.
Some people enjoy trying to decipher a director's intent when he/she kidnaps a composer's creation and shapes it into his/her own vision. Those people have much to enjoy here.

Well done in all areas.

Vladimir Vaneev is Prince Yuri Vsevolodovich. Maxim Aksenov is Prince Vsevolod Yuryevich. Svetlana Ignatovich is Fevroniya. John Daszak is Grishka Kuterma. Marc Albrecht conducts the Netherlands Philharmonic Orchestra.
The music is excellent, the acting is very good. Some of the stage sets work well, some don't.

THE LADY MACBETH OF MTSENSK-Shostakovich 2006  (3.0 stars)
Eva-Maria Westbroek is Katerina Lvovna Ismailova. Christopher Ventris is Sergey. Vladimir Vaneev is Boris Timofeyevich Ismailov. Mariss Jansons conducts the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra.
Eva-Maria Westbroek is outstanding as Katerina. The music and acting in general are excellent. The director uses a glass house surrounded by dirt as the primary scenery. I have to admit I am out of patience with directors who are too unskilled or too lazy to develop truly supportive scenery, and instead try to pawn off a stripped down set as ""deeply symbolic"".
The director changed the ending to suit his own fancy.

8749189,1,B01B2Y5P9I,"I received this set a few days ago and have only had a chance to look at the Eugene Onegin disk, so shall confine my comments to that opera. It's unbelieveably badly staged. Stefan Herheim directed the production and did his best to destroy the opera as Tchaikovsky conceived of it--or as any opera lover knows it. He mounted a travesty production where fashionable art-about-art cliches (the opera singers are patrons in a theater watching themselves sing the opera and move between their tuxedo-clad roles as audience members and their peasant roles as on-stage singers--get it?), melodramatic grimaces and poses, and every other imaginable faddish depredation and hip university-educated cultural studies cliche (e.g. Herheim is clearly alluding to the soon-to-be occurring class struggle in Russia, which of course Eugene Onegin has nothing to do with) is foisted off as ""artistic profoundity."" The singing is generally at a very high level, but I had to turn off the picture on my TV to enjoy it and not be distracted by what Herheim has done to mangle and confuse it visually and theatrically. Not surprisingly, the experience was slightly improved by not having to watch it. Not exactly the reason I bought a Blu-Ray! Next time I'll stick to my CD collection. I am bracing myself for the other productions in the set. Why do opera directors do this? Why don't orchestra conductors (in this case, the wonderful Mariss Jansons) resist? Why don't the singers protest? Why don't audiences boo? Let's bring back hissing, booing, and foot-stamping and maybe we'll get what we deserve--or is this it? Are we this passive, this meek, this uninformed about what matters and what art is and can be? My real fear is that maybe we are getting what we deserve.

A postscript: I have now looked at another opera in the set and it re-confirms my impression. The prospective purchaser should be advised of something that is not made clear by the decripton on this page: More than one of these operas is a pardody-comedy-farce version of the orginal opera--taking tragedy and playing it for laughs, taking personal drama and treating it as a circus act, etc.. Prospective purchasers, be advised.",1469318400,3,2185,4.969945355191257
