5085672,4,B007GMKX5W,"Not bad for the price. I wanted to bring a bit of Designing Women back. I used to watch this in the afternoon after school.. Along with The Golden Girls. I have always had an affinity for Julia Sugerbaker and Dorothy Zbornak.  While The Golden Girls are now on Hallmark -- though censored, which is annoying -- Designing Women is no longer on cable. I didn't have the money to buy all of their seasons as it's a bit pricey, in my opinion. But this two pack CDs of DW is a nice option to get a bit of them back. I do find the music a bit different and louder than when it was aired and in reruns-- I have to quickly turn my volume down, not to blow me ear drums out, and then turn it back up so that I can hear them talking. Their theme music, quality and volume of which were much better on TV. But that's the only thing that I find annoying.",1491350400,2,842,3.9822485207100593

5085676,5,B007GMKX5W,"An all time favorite!  This is a great show about southern women and about running a successful home designing business.  The characters are all different with different foibles, talents, and personality.  You will love how one of the southern belles tells people what she really thinks, leaving nothing to the imagination.  She is eloquent and fun to watch as she ""tells people off"".  This is a great DVD for stress relief and a good laugh.",1477180800,4,441,4.826666666666667

5085680,3,B007GMKX5W,"Not sure if these episodes would have made my personal top twenty but still this is a nice little compilation of ""Designing Women"".  Dipping back into the well of eighties television is a dicey proposition, experience keeps revealing that these programs don't hold up quite as well as one remembers.  This comedic series about two Atlanta sisters; Julia and Suzanne Sugarbaker run a design house along with three associates which ran for five season premiering in 1986.

The ensemble cast work well together and there are some funny bits to be sure.  Dixie Carter as Julia became famous for her amusing diatribes on any number of subjects.  Creator, Linda Bloodworth-Thomason is well known for her strong female characters and Julia is a prime example.  Any number of shows back then felt compelled to tackle social issues (AIDS, sexual assault, etc.) which when viewed today seem strained and awkward (especially for a comedy).  Probably the funniest is Delta Burke's former beauty queen Suzanne; she gets most of the best lines and her over the top narcissism is very entertaining.  Rounding out the cast are Annie Potts as designer Mary Jo Shively, Jean Smart as Charlene Frazier the office manager, and the wonderful Mesach Taylor as Anthony Bouvier the firms driver and delivery man.

Watching shows like these remind us how bad the decades fashions were, the big shoulders, the bigger glasses frames, and the even bigger hair styles.  Three and a half stars for this collection, still amusing in spots but material feels dated at times.",1465257600,2,1542,5.011764705882353

5085685,4,B007GMKX5W,"I bought this as a gift for someone else and realized how much I had missed the ladies at Sugarbaker's. I opened it and it is a great compilation of some really memorable episodes!  If you miss Susanne, Mary Jo, Julia and Charlene, this is a great option instead of buying the whole series.",1456531200,4,290,4.37037037037037

5085717,5,B007GMKX5W,"I don't know who decided or how they decided what episodes were included . Ex: Why would you have  "" The Return of Ray Don ""
without the original Ray Don  episode ?

They did include one of my top picks---"" Julia and Suzanne's Big Adventure "" .",1387152000,5,244,4.041666666666667
5085718,4,B007GMKX5W,"It was good to see these episodes again. With any compilation there are going to be 1 or 2 you wished were on there but the selection on this is rounded enough to justify getting it.
I recommend it if you have an itch to watch a few episodes but don't want to buy the first 5 seasons. Overall really good.",1382745600,5,305,4.016393442622951

5085722,4,B007GMKX5W,"Great show, great episodes. If you ever liked Designing Women you will remember 1 (or more) of these episodes. Classic characters and good plots make this a collection to have.",1364688000,2,176,4.9
5085723,5,B007GMKX5W,This show makes me smile and laugh some twenty plus years after it was first on the air! The wit and humor these women possess is amazing and even after seeing some episodes many times over they still make me laugh out loud!,1363996800,,224,4.232558139534884
5085724,5,B007GMKX5W,it's a lot like watching the silly golden girls and almost as funny!  I just couldn't believe that there was more than one show with at least 1 comic. relief character.,1359072000,,168,4.419354838709677
5085725,5,B007GMKX5W,"I watched Designing Women when it first came on and have watched every rerun on TV. These women were strong, witty women who stood by their morals no matter what. I am excited to be collecting the cd's , so that when the reruns become too tame for stations to show (not enough sex, violence, or fowl language) I will have hours of entertainment.",1349308800,10,345,4.40625
5085726,5,B007GMKX5W,These are timeless classics featuring main original cast thoroughly enjoyed and remembering of the show and how good it was. Laugh out loud funny and sometimes emotional always good in the end.  All your favorites are here..makes you want more!,1348876800,3,244,5.1
5085727,5,B007GMKX5W,"With a terrific classic comedy, how does one choose only twenty shows to put into an anthology?  It's almost impossible, and that's why most viewers will find themselves loving the selections and simultaneously thinking that a past favorite didn't make the cut.  This certainly doesn't detract from the greatness of the episodes on this DVD collection.  For the ardent fan, this is an economical way to see lots of great, unedited shows.  If you want to see more, you probably need to buy the full-season box sets!",1343606400,7,514,4.873563218390805
5085728,3,B007GMKX5W,"Shout sure knows how to get blood out of a turnip.  There are about half a dozen ""timeless"" episodes on this set, but not near what I'd hoped.  I'll be skipping this one and sticking with my season sets.  It's a pity, because I'm sure had there been more of the better ""timeless"" episodes (""They Shoot Fat Women, Don't They?"" ""The Beauty Contest,"" ""Design House,"" ""The Emperor's New Nose,"" ""Blame It On New Orleans""...so many better episodes they could have chosen...this would have sold much better.

I was planning on buying over two dozen copies of this had the episode selection been better.  Sure, that's not a ton of money, but I'm sure I wasn't the only one.",1338854400,36,665,4.601694915254237
