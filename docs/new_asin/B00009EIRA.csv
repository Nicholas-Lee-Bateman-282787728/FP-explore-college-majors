1882962,5,B00009EIRA,"I submitted a very positive review on 12/1/08 regarding my purchase of the DVD Dodson's Journey from seller zman555amazon@charter.net, but apparently that review wasn't received. So I will reemphasize that it was a pleasure doing business with the very accommodating seller. The product was as described and arrived in record time. I would purchase from this seller again and it's always a been a 5-star experience doing business with Amazon.
Thank you.

1882964,5,B00009EIRA,"Dodson's Journey is a great film about relationships.  David Elliot is super as a gentle feeling dad trying to communicate with his daughter and deal with his own feelings of loss.  Loss of his father, his marriage and his dreams.  Good for all ages.  beautiful people and beautiful country.  David's real life wife, Nancy plays a small part.",1147392000,3,342,4.827586206896552
1882965,5,B00009EIRA,"I purchased this DVD mainly because I'm a JAG-fan and wanted to see something else acting D.J.Elliott. I'm glad I did. This is a wonderful, quiet film, with unexpected depths. Since then, I've watched it many-many times, read Dodson's novel and almost all the other books he mentions. A good film lead me to a deeper knowledge of American literature and culture. Thanks D.J.E.!",1138665600,9,377,4.90625
1882966,5,B00009EIRA,"Acting was very realistic.  David Elliot is brilliant in this one.  You get a real feel for the sadness this family goes through as it is on the brink of divorce, but with the sadness is also hope for a new beginning!
Great movie for all ages!!",1085875200,8,244,4.170212765957447
1882967,5,B00009EIRA,"I bought this movie because I am a huge David James Elliott fan.  But now that I have watched it it's put into my video arsenal as one of my favorites. The relationship between James and his daughter Maggie reminded me of the relationship my  father has with both my sister and I.  James uses his journey to not only come to terms with his coming divorce with his wife and the ghosts from his past, but also to create a special bond with his daughter and create memories that will last forever.  I highly recommend this film to anyone looking for quality family entertainment that will warm your heart",1081728000,6,601,4.4363636363636365
1882968,5,B00009EIRA,"I am a 35 year old male, and although I don't have any of my own kids, I can say this film did a great job of making a soulful journey for a man that is wanting to keep his family in tact, while the wife is feeling that the relationship has ended.  There are two kids involved, but the poetic nature of the film treats these matters with great delicacy and love in the midst of adversity. The pleasantness of this film is the simplicity of what is real an important. The relationship between him and his daughter is precious. One previous film done by this director: Simple Life of Noah Dearborn.  I have not seen that one, but I am looking forward to it now after seeing this film.",1069200000,18,682,4.198473282442748
1882969,2,B00009EIRA,"The reason why I am disappointed in this movie is no closed captioning on it. I barely understand it without CC or English subtitle. I can speak for deaf and hard of hearing people, it is extremely frustrating for me when a studio doesn't produce it with CC or English subtitle. I know the movie is good but no CC.",1061078400,,314,4.25

7990747,5,B00009EIRA,"Any one who loves David James Elliott will probably love this movie. The scenery is beautiful. The story is heartbreaking, but a true depiction of real life and the way it should be lived. A lot of emotions are shared in this movie but don't expect a truly happy ending. Set in a fairy tale surrounding vista but not a happy ever after movie.",1446249600,,342,4.359375
7990748,5,B00009EIRA,"After 11 years of marriage and two children, Jimmy Dodson's (DJE) wife decides she wants a divorce.  Jimmy's dying father (Robert Loggia) recalls all the times he and Jimmy went fly fishing, reciting poetry when they cast.  He encourages Jimmy to take 7-year-old Maggie fly fishing, encouraging Jimmy to take responsibility for his own actions.  It's a 3-week trip of bittersweet self-discovery for both.  Well done in every respect; DJE and his wife, Nanci Chambers were also executive producers.  This thoughtful story provokes introspection long after the dvd has ended!",1443916800,,573,5.322222222222222

7990750,4,B00009EIRA,"This is a wonderful movie that takes some unexpected turns.  David James Elliot and the supporting cast are great.  Great family movie, but does have divorce involved.  The bonding of a father and daughter through trying times and some great scenery.  I will watch this movie many times and already have.",1398297600,,304,4.901960784313726
7990751,5,B00009EIRA,I loved the story of an emotional journey with his daughter.  It warmed my heart to see evolving a great  father and daughter relationship.  I always like David James Elliott specifically for a role like this knowing how he is in his real life as a father.  I would think many children would envy to have a father like it.,1395360000,,322,4.316666666666666
7990752,5,B00009EIRA,I really like the story about a man who finds himself during his journey and also gets closer to his daugther. Nice movie. Will watch it again.,1376870400,,143,4.333333333333333

7990754,5,B00009EIRA,"Thrilled I found this seller's offer!  An exceptional movie, directed by Gregg Champion, based on a true story, ""Faithful Travelers"", by journalist James Dodson. As Mr. Dodson, David James Elliott gives a fabulously sensitive portrayal of a man in utter turmoil in his life from drastic changes brought about by deaths and sudden impending divorce.  Not only does his performance take us to the depths of his own journey, but he so amazingly at the same time interacts with the other characters---his wife, children, and parents---on each one's journey through all of this.  Every performance spot-on--including Robert Loggia, Ellen Burstyn, Penelope Ann Miller, and Allicia Morton as the pre-teen daughter.  A terrible shame this movie has not receive more continued wide-spread distribution!  A great adult and family movie all at the same time---so much (!) to enjoy and learn from the heritage and life experiences shared by this writer and these dedicated actors. If you have the chance to purchase, would most highly recommend it!",1362873600,,1036,5.254545454545455
