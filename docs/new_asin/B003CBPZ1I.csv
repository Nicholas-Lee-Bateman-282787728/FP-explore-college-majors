4107775,3,B003CBPZ1I,"Guys don't come much cuter than Shahid Kapur and he sure can bust a move, but when you come down to it that's all this film really has going for it. The screenplay combines two stories that are cliches in both Hollywood and Bollywood 1)that of the suffering actor trying to make it big and 2)the teacher who turns a class of misfits into a winning team. The film doesn't do much with the second plotline at all. But in all fairness it does milk the melodrama in our long suffering hero's life for all it's worth by employing great swells of music as life hits him with one sucker punch after another. Will he ever realise his dream and become a star? Are you kidding me? This is Bollywood. CHANCE PE DANCE wasn't bad for a one time viewing but it's nothing special, still I will be checking out some more of Kapur's films. The kid's got talent. And looks. Did I mention the looks?",1278115200,3,880,4.307228915662651
4107776,2,B003CBPZ1I,"In the sprawling city of Mumbai, Sameer Behl has been at this for three years now, an aspiring actor trying to get a foot in the door. But that big break is an elusive thing and there's an endless series of hoops to jump thru. And we've seen it all before, haven't we?

CHANCE PE DANCE (""Chance to Dance"") stars two beautiful looking actors in Shahid Kapoor and Genelia D'Souza, but then to stymie that advantage, someone butchers the screenplay and the music. When the premise is already something so unoriginal, lazy storytelling and lifelessness on the screen spell the kiss of oblivion.

The sad thing is that the movie starts out so promisingly, with Sameer in his cramped one-room apartment getting ready for his day. In a nicely choreographed sequence, we see him go about his peculiar morning routine. But the moment he steps outside - and even wielding that armor of optimism that he does - the film begins tanking it.

Shahid Kapoor has talent and he's been in good movies before (VIVAH, JAB WE MET, 36 CHINA TOWN). But here the material he's given to work with is just so trite and tepid... Sure, his character Sameer is immediately sympathetic, and you can't help but feel for a guy who'd just gotten evicted from his tiny apartment, fired from his courier gig, lied to by a film director, and stiffed by his freeloading roommate. To make ends meet, Sameer, now living in his car, is forced to take up teaching dance at the local public school, but at least the school gives him an opportunity to sneak in to perform his morning ablutions. But even though the guy is down and out, the by-the-numbers narrative informs you that the happy ending is just around the corner. Sameer Behl, it turns out, is one of those cats who can go thru a horrible stretch and keep his hair nicely mussed and his biceps and abs really well-defined. His eventual stardom may be predestined, but I didn't get the sense that the guy really earned it.

Sameer teaching the loser kids to dance becomes a dead-end sub-plot. The movie barely spends time on Sameer with the kids before they're off to the big annual dance competition, and even that gets the perfunctory bum's rush. The film also glosses over scenes featuring the television reality show in which Sameer ends up competing. It also doesn't cement the believability of the thing that Shahid is obviously so much better at busting a move than Genelia, and this then undermines Genelia as Tina the choreographer. Genelia, poor soul, gets a thankless role and seems to be there only to look pretty and to hold Sameer's hand.

It would've helped the cause, too - this movie being so dance-centric - if the musical tracks were memorable. They're not.

If you like this sort of story, but better executed, check out LUCK BY CHANCE instead. Now that movie has a pulse.",1269993600,,2810,4.6438631790744465

4107785,5,B003CBPZ1I,"There are so many things going on in this movie, it's hard to put them all together. But it doesn't matter. Each theme, each plot, is worth watching. I thought the female lead was attractive and talented. And of course, the male lead is gorgeous and studly. So much dancing! So many contests and auditions. So many victories!

Without all the temporary defeats, the movie would have no plot. But we could still look at these very attractive people and watch them dance.

A very enjoyable film!",1445644800,,493,4.655172413793103

4107787,4,B003CBPZ1I,"I clicked on this because I love dance movies...but I'm not a big fan of Bollywood.  What a surprise!  Shahid Kapoor can MOVE! And it doesn't hurt that he has a phenomenal dancer's body, and shows it to it's fullest in the end dance scene.  He also has pretty good comedic timing.  Lead actress was way, way, way over top and got a little irritating.  Kids in the dance class/competition were really cute.  Ended up watching the whole thing and thoroughly enjoying it.",1443657600,,468,4.578313253012048

Lots of lively music and dancing and a half-decent storyline. I liked the involvement of the school kids. The female lead was sweet but nothing special in the acting or dancing department. Kapoor is a very good actor though and not to be under-estimated. This part is very different to the last movie I saw him in and both times he has been excellent. My only gripe would be the dance scenes were not filmed as well as they could have been. Too many special effects and ""creative"" shots. More of the actual dancing please.
Love Bollywood movies. If anyone has any recommendations, feel free to post them.",1424390400,,761,4.7293233082706765

Only the first routine was worth seeing. Often the creative camera work detracted from the dancing--it prevented the viewer from even seeing an entire routine.

4107828,3,B003CBPZ1I,"I'm a California girl of European caucasian descent, and this was my second jump into Bollywood on the recommendation of Indian friends.

This movie was fun and good entertainment, and I saw a lot of similarity to the hope and despair many young Americans experience when they run off to Hollywood with dreams of being a star, only without drugs, prostitution, or the absolute eating away of soul among those struggling for a chance that I saw when I lived in Los Angeles.

I was surprised that almost the entire cast could have passed for caucasian. My Indian friends have considerably darker skin. I was also surprised by the mixing in of Western and American language and phrases with native language, and the predominance of Western clothes.

So far I'm finding Indian movies to be a little predicable, but just the same, I cried several times in this movie. I even cried although I didn't believe in the romance between Sameer and the one girl who winds up being a true friend (no chemistry), and even though I thought the opening credits dance scene was far more compelling than the one that was part of the plot, which launched Sameer to stardom. I'm afraid that dance scene was mostly effects and very little visible dancing.

I'm not sure how to rate it. I just can't give it a 5 because it didn't have a whole lot of plot, originality or depth, but I enjoyed it and the acting really was very good, far better than in many or even most American rom-coms. I recommend it.",1402444800,,1480,4.573584905660377

4107832,4,B003CBPZ1I,"This movie builds an Environment as if we are ourselves in the movie. Storyline is quite touching having a long-lasting impact on viewers. The movie depicts the struggle of the current generation whose talents are suppressed by the influential personalities. We all being a part of this system can feel it ourselves. The movie is a family-entertainer and has hilarious comedy sequences.

Ken Ghosh has done a great job on his part. This movie is certainly better than his Directorial debut and creates a milestone in his Career. Acting by Shahid, Genelia and Mohnish Behl(despite his short appearance)were great. Dancing talent of Shahid is an eye-candy to the viewers. ""Pal mein hi"" song enraptures the audience. To sum up this movie is a great entertainer and also gives a great social message. Finallly this movie is a worth watching with numerous memorable moments(especially the South Indian ad by Shahid)so go watch the movie with your family!!",1304467200,3,950,5.089743589743589
