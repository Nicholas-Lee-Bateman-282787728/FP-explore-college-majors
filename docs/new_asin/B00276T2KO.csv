3862042,5,B00276T2KO,"I enjoyed viewing this movie from 1951.  I had read the articles that talked about Joan Crawford's rude treatment of Janice Rule, but even knowing this was taking place in the background, the movie was fun.  I am glad the movies that have not been available on video before are being released.  My only disappointment has been the warning that it might not play on a DVD-R.  I can only play this one on my DVD-R;  it will not play at all on the DVD-player I have in another room.  The picture is nice and clear.  Get the movie, sit back, and enjoy!

3862043,5,B00276T2KO,"Another rare movie of Joan's that has finally found a home on DVD. This along with a dozen other rare Crawford titles are availble on the Warner Brother's website at cheaper prices as well; among the films for sale are ""Mannequin"", ""This Woman Is Dangerous"", and ""Ice Follies of 1939"".
 ""Goodbye, My Fancy"" tells the tale of a congresswoman, played by Joan, who returns to her alma mater to receive an honorary degree. Once back at her former college she encounters the university's president with whom she once had a love affair with. The president of the university is played by long-time Crawford friend Robert Young, with whom Crawford co-starred with in ""The Shining Hour"". Young would go on to television fame in ""Marcus Welby, MD"". In 1970 when daughter Christina landed a guest star part on Young's TV series Joan was not at all impressed. Joan hung up on Christina upon hearing the news, and Crawford told a friend that the only reason her daughter called was to brag about the guest star part when she knew full well that ""Marcus Welby"" was the one show she(Joan) always wanted to be on.
 Joan is also reunited with her former ""Mildred Pierce"" co-star Eve Arden, who plays Joan's secretary.
 ""Goodbye, My Fancy"" is not an excellent film by any means, but it's entertaining. This film was directed by Vincent Sherman, who was having an affair with Joan at the time of filming. It would be the last picture Sherman would direct Crawford in; the first two were ""Harriet Craig"" and ""The Damned Don't Cry"".
 This DVD has no bonus features.",1246060800,6,1544,4.707407407407407

3862045,3,B00276T2KO,"This is one 3 forgettable pictures (the other 2 being ""Female on the Beach"" and ""This Woman is Dangerous"") that Joan made during the '50s that have been somewhat hard-to-find. Besides a laser disc more than 10 years ago, ""Goodbye, My Fancy"" has never been released on any other format. This film reminds me of a cross between ""Autumn Leaves"" and ""The Story of Esther Costello"".

In this film, Joan plays a college alumni who returns to her alma matter to receive an honorary degree. There's also a subplot concerning Agatha (Joan's character) and an old flame. However, the plot moves around a lot and doesn't have a centric theme. It's almost like one of those pictures that just goes on for a bit before ending. It wasn't a bad movie though.

Here is a list of all of the recent Joan Crawford DVDs that Warner Bros. put out this year (note: none of these films have been remastered and are not special issues and everything is on DVD-minus-R):

Dance Fools Dance (1931)

Possessed (1931)
Chained (1934)
Forsaking All Others (1934)
Love on the Run (1936)
Mannequin (1938)

Although I think everyone should watch all of Joan's movies because they all have a historical importance (not to mention a large entertainment value), I have to say that I find the price of this film absolutely obscene. How can anyone justify charging such a large sum for such an old film like this that is often shown on television (TCM)? I am 100% certain that Joan would not be happy about this. She would never approve of her fans being overcharged, especially during a recession. However out of respect for Joan, I will not take off a single star from my rating of this movie.",1242777600,28,2278,5.053191489361702

Otherwise it's a bit long and meandering with a wtf ending.

8354142,4,B00276T2KO,"I had never seen this Joan Crawford movie, made in the 1950s when she was in her forties.  If you are a fan, then this should be in your library.  Crawford has not yet made the transition here to the scarily overdone eyebrows and lips.  Her figure is gorgeous -- if only I had looked that good in my forties. And she does the most that can be done with a script which is a tad underwritten.  Once again, Crawford is the consummate professional actress.

The story is a nice love triangle.  Crawford is a congresswoman who is invited back to give the commencement speech at her alma mater, a woman's college that looks to be modeled after Smith or Bryn Mawr.  Only it really isn't her alma mater because years earlier, when she was on the verge of graduating, she was caught sneaking back into her dormitory at five o'clock in the morning and expelled.  She would not give a reason why she was out so late, but obviously it was a assignation with a man whom she refused to name.

The two men interested in our heroine are the college president, played by Robert Young, and a savvy political reporter, played by Frank Lovejoy.  The movie can't really make up its mind what genre it belongs to.  The trailer (included on the DVD) calls it a romantic comedy.  But it's not a laugh-fest.  It's really rather serious, and explores the choices people make in their lives and whether people really change.  Young actress Janice Rule, in her first major movie role, has a nice part as Robert Young's daughter.  (Her most famous role is as Merle, the bitchy socialite girlfriend of James Stewart in ""Bell, Book and Candle.)  There are also a couple of well-done love scenes.

There are two interesting facets about this movie which might appeal to collectors of movie lore.  The first concerns the relationship between Joan Crawford and Janice Rule during the making of the film.  The story goes that Crawford was so mean to Rule during the shoot (jealousy?) that years later she wrote a letter of apology for her horrible behavior.  It's kind of interesting to think about the whole ""Mommy Dearest"" thing while watching these two on the screen together.  The other is that the third prong of the love triangle is played by Frank Lovejoy who is really best known as a radio performer.  So fans of old-time radio have a chance to see Lovejoy in a rare love-interest/leading man part in a motion picture.  (Usually when Lovejoy is in a film, he plays a heavy or a cop.)

Recommended for movie buffs and Joan Crawford fans.",1398902400,3,2510,4.563758389261745
8354143,2,B00276T2KO,"This film fails both as a provocative jeremiad about censorship on a college campus and as a light exhibition of a lost love that may be rekindled.

To have both of these themes combined in a single film is a recipe for a product likely to fail.

The censorship issue is still relevant today, e.g., the rescinding of speaking engagements of controversial individuals, the firing of instructors who may deviate from ""acceptable"" attitudes, and others too numerous to list. The film espouses a college instruction that should expose the students to divergent opinions and to world affairs. In short, to fully prepare young minds for entry into adulthood.

But exploring this worthy and serious theme is thwarted by the film's portrayal of a romance that occurred many years ago, one that involved Joan Crawford's then-student and Robert Young's then-teacher. During a reunion at this very same college, both parties meet again with the realization that their respective feelings still run very deeply.

To convincingly combine these two very different tropes is a difficult task, and this film does not succeed. As a result, both themes are not fully explored with nuance and depth - and are both too lightly and unsatisfyingly treated.

It is unfortunate that this stellar cast was consigned to this weak vehicle, but a young Janice Rule and an attractive campus background present pleasant diversions.",1380153600,,1401,5.12719298245614

8354146,5,B00276T2KO,"this is a very underrated movie. it is one of joan crawford's best movies. she plays a congresswoman who returns to her college alma mater to receive an honorary degree. it is a wonderful mix of drama, sentimentality, and comedy. joan is ably supported by the wonderful eve arden who steals the movie as joan's secretary, woody, whose ""mind is always on the tip of her tongue""! eve has one witty, acid line after another. frank lovejoy is great as joan's old beau from their war years. robert young is joan's college prof. this is a warm sentimental movie. check it out. happy movie watching. aloha haleiwa jon",1361232000,4,610,4.657407407407407
8354147,4,B00276T2KO,Joan Crawford portrays this character brilliantly. Joan pours her soul into every script character given to her. It was great to see Eve Arden team up again with her from the Mildred Pierce days - another must watch Crawford movie.,1353196800,,231,4.8
8354148,2,B00276T2KO,"Filmed during the midst of the McCarthy era, this film purports to show how a courageous congresswoman tries to tell college students via a film, how ""fascists"" are trying to control their lives, deny them ""free speech,"" etc. Unfortunately, the alumni of the college, led by an arrogant White (is anyone surprised?), right-wing businessman, are determined not to allow the film to be shown, for the students' ""own good.""

In other words, the picture comes across like the pipe dream of a typical Hollywood liberal, even of 60 years ago: All repression is done by reactionary, wealthy White males who want to keep ""the people"" under their thumb. Conveniently overlooked by the screenplay is the fact that, by 1951, there were no ""fascists"" left to repress anyone -- but plenty of Communists.

In a further irony, the suppression of free speech on campus 60 years later, in our own time, is being done by ultra-liberal professors and administrators who believe that conservatives are not only mistaken, but EVIL, and who will move heaven and earth to keep them from ever successfully holding programs on any real estate the liberals control. Add in the ""rent-a-mobs"" who can always be counted on to show up and try to heckle, threaten, or break up such gatherings, and you can see that this film's depiction of the situations on campuses is no longer valid -- that is, if it ever was.",1349568000,,1382,4.827004219409282
