5165093,3,B008HFS390,I have only 1 alltime favorite band and that is Zep. This was not authorized by Zepplin and it shows.,1367798400,3,101,4.1
5165094,1,B008HFS390,"In my opinion, the whole CD was a dup on us that bought it. I should have returned it but had already trashed everything for returns. I just chalked it up to, in my opinion some people that make a living doing this have no qualms about what they do. I'll just donate them my money and call it charity and hope they get a better job. I will be more careful in the future as to what I buy and keep the return package stuff.
""TREBLE CLEF PRODUCTION"" is on the back. I would run from anything they had there name on. I am fired up now that I think about how this item in my opinion was such a ripoff.
All of the statements above are just this persons opinion and that is all my opinion.",1366502400,18,682,3.949275362318841
5165095,1,B008HFS390,Do not buy this dvd unless you want a documentary about Physical Graffitti....it has very little Zep in it --mostly 2 men speaking about the groups of that era.  One of the worst dvd's I have ever watched and very misleading --I thought when I purchased it --that it was going to be about Led Zeppelin--what a waste of money.  It was all talk and NO music.,1363737600,36,356,4.298507462686567
5165096,1,B008HFS390,"Once again, the video company Chrome Dreams reissues a video under a different name in order to make a quick buck on an unsuspecting consumer. This video is a re-release of ""Led Zeppelin-Physical Graffiti: A Classic Album Under Review"". Please be aware the content is exactly the same as the aforementioned release. As I have said before, do not blame Amazon for this shameless ripoff, as I'm sure they do not realize what's going on here. This company is becoming famous for this sales tactic- releasing an old title under a brand new one in order to sell more product. They have done this many times before. Now, if you have not purchased the ""Classic Album Under Review"" title, you will no doubt enjoy this DVD. It's full of entertaining clips and informative information regarding the release of ""Physical Graffiti"".
I'm just tired of seeing these old releases being renamed and dumped on the market.",1363651200,68,904,4.838709677419355
5165097,5,B008HFS390,This DVD is made when they were peaking. I hope Robert Plant is correct and there is a Led. Zep. tour next year.,1362182400,2,112,3.9130434782608696
5165098,4,B008HFS390,"I have the 2 DVD edition of this show.
It is a great performance however the one shown here is unofficial and should not be available on Amazon.
Maybe Jimmy Page will release it for real one of these days.",1188345600,,205,4.15
5165099,4,B008HFS390,"Although This DVD Zeppelin concert is from 1975 and has good quality image and sound, it results interesting by the material that the band plays on stage. It's not easy to play more than three hours but they did very well. It's true that the listening of the voice of Robert Plant is something eroded and rough but the emotion is still there and the musical skills of Jimmy Page, John Paul Johns and John Bonham are really great. Never before seen live tracks in any other video like ""Over The Hills And Far Away"", ""Kashmir"" or ""In My Time Of Dying"" are great surprises as wel as this fabulous version of version of ""Black Dog"". It's true that this DVD isn't the best of all Led Zep's videology but you can enjoy the music... The music programme is:

Rock & Roll, Sick Again, Over The Hills And Far Away, In My Time Of Dying, The Song Remains The Same, The Rain Song, Kashmir, No Quarter, Tangerine, the acoustic set: Going To California, That's The Way, and Bron-Y-Aur Stomp; Trampled Underfoot, Moby Dick, Dazed & Confused, Stairway To Heaven, Whole Lotta Love, Black Dog. ...Good Luck!",1181174400,,1088,4.551020408163265

8528168,1,B008HFS390,WOULD NOT BUY. NO MUSIC VIDEOS ONLY INTERVIEWS BY OTHERS. NOT EVEN PROMOTED BY ZEPPELIN. TOTAL RIP OFF,1467417600,2,102,4.722222222222222
8528169,5,B008HFS390,It was a christmas gift for my husband and it has been watched several times.  Very informative and he has enjoyed it.,1421107200,2,118,4.363636363636363
8528170,5,B008HFS390,"I have to say anything with Led Zeppelin in it is great.  I never had the chance to see them live, so it's kind of like
seeing them.",1404950400,,132,3.7142857142857144
8528171,1,B008HFS390,"I was expecting a full concert from one of my favorite legendary bands. But no, all it is, is talk,talk,talk. I bought this DVD for sound. Needs to be described better by the seller.",1399852800,,182,4.382352941176471
8528172,5,B008HFS390,"Focusing largely on Physical Graffiti and the events that surrounded that masterpiece, this film is very watchable and enjoyable if that period Zep is your thing. Good interviews, some decent footage and well produced.",1376956800,3,218,5.4411764705882355
8528173,5,B008HFS390,"If it is Led Zeppelin, I love it.  Watching these four together, well, there is nothing like it.  Never will be again.",1371600000,,118,4.318181818181818
8528174,1,B008HFS390,"KEEP YOUR MONEY...This has got to be the worst DVD ever made about LED ZEPPELIN (unless you watch ""Physical Graffiti: A Classic Album Under Review ""or "" MAXIMUM LED ZEPPELIN"". Two of these say CHROME DREAMS is the production/publishing co. The other one says TREBLE CLEF 2012.......all of these seem to be based in the same location...New Malden, Surrey in the UK......2012....2008....2001 respectively. WHAT A JOKE!!! This time the joke is on me!! Was I embarrassed? Yes, so much so that it took me 6 months to write this review. The best part of this is that upon reviewing my order history with Amazon for the past 6 months, I was reminded that I had not left a review...So, this is it !! I am sure there is a Food Bank or a Homeless Shelter in your town. Send them your $$$$'s or donate it to the ASPCA .  Somebody out there is HUNGRY!!! Trust me on this, you will feel better and now, so do I !!",1370217600,10,900,4.357142857142857
