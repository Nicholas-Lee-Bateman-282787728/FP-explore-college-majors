the outtakes which include Layne

""Pornholio"" Beachley trying to

do her best Beavis & Butthead

but her Australian accent & no

shirt over the head blows it

also someone doing there best

impression of a duck going up

some stairs & the chapter on the

disc ""Baby Got Back"" where a

couple of the ladies mock

7962068,4,B00006673R,"For starters, this DVD is only 40 minutes long.  However, it has the best women surfers in the world.  I was disappointed how little footage there was of Megan Abubo (since she is my personal favorite).  None the less, this is an awesome DVD to add to your collection.  This DVD really shows how far women's surfing has come along.  A must for all surfers.",1052352000,4,356,4.415384615384616
7962069,4,B00006673R,"I had heard good things about this DVD on a surfing girls online forum so i picked it up.  when i first started it i totally thought that it was nothing but a total bikini fest, but as it progressed it was really quite good.  Not very long, but they hit a lot of the major spots (North Shore, Tahiti,The Crossing, Indo, etc) except for SoCal and Oz.  The footage at Teaphoo was amazing!!!  I would recommend picking it up...the extra footage at the end is hilarious.",1051574400,4,466,4.32183908045977
