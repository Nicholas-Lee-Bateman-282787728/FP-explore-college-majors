8420468,5,B004ALTU1K,"I've been told that Russians watch this movie every year on new year's day, much the same way Americans watch It's a Wonderful Life every year on Christmas. The film was released when I was three, but it still seems relevant enough to me (although the basic premise relies on a style of residential construction that is really not found in America...at least not to the extent that it is in the former Soviet Union).

I purchased the film to practice listening to the Russian language and improve my ability to speak it. Much of the film is very difficult to understand because the speaker is drunk, but I suppose I'll be prepared for hanging out in bars now. :)

The film's humor translates well even if you're just reading the subtitles. People that are not actively studying the Russian language will enjoy it also.",1304208000,4,818,4.63448275862069
