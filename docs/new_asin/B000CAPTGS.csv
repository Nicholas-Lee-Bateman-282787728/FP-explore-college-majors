8096531,5,B000CAPTGS,"This was great and in some ways, better than the first season.  A lot of new characters were introduced, like Maisie McGinty and her grandfather and Max's brother Del.  This season was somewhat lighter than Season 1.  Honey Bailey has some happiness here, marrying Max Sutton, reuniting with all of her children, and opening her own beauty shop.  Mae Bailey is the one who seems to have problems here, as she comes very close to losing the mine, (the introduction of Mr. McGinty, an old friend of hers, deepens her character somewhat)and there are times when I feel sorry for her.  I really like the character of Grace and hope that she is able to marry Del or some nice guy.  She is constantly battling her shyness and seeking independence.  She comes across as a stronger person in this season.",1143763200,5,796,4.642857142857143
