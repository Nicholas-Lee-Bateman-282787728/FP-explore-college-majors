8065698,5,B0009RQRTC,"If you like the kind of ""Cult"" films, Virus Buster Serge is a must have in your collection. Onari's anatomy is almost an animeted anatomy class. The story is too deep and peculiar nuances for the right eyes. If not this series would not be so difficult to find, among other things. Thankfully the original audio is there as well - not that I know japanese, but I am kindo f purist in such things. An excellent japanese animation.",1358726400,,429,4.443037974683544
8065699,5,B0009RQRTC,"As a person who prefers old school animation, I have to say I loved the show!
12 Episodes, show done by the creators of Fatal Fury: The motion Pic so if you liked that then maybe you'll love this one.
The story overall is good, didn't get bored and the action scenes are there in most of the episodes, and it didn't end so bad either.
So if you aren't into buying, you should try and find online and watch at least once.",1307836800,,420,4.072289156626506
8065700,5,B0009RQRTC,"VBS  is a 12 -episode series.  Despite  others' claims that it is confusing, I enjoyed it, because I couldn't figure out where it was headed.  I would up with several questions which could have been answered in a second season.

  Such as:
  How long did Macus stay in command of the reformed STAND?
  Why was only Neo Hong Kong the only city affected by the virus.?
  After Serge  destroyed the satellite where the virus originated from, did the virus reappaear somewhere else on earth?  It would  almost have to, otherwise there would be no need fir Macus and reformed STAND.",1202601600,2,577,4.62
8065701,5,B0009RQRTC,"A very sci-fi anime, lots of action.  It has an evangelion feel to it.  Can go by very quickly, i watched it in about 2 days.  You should buy this for how cheap it is.",1183248000,4,167,3.7142857142857144
