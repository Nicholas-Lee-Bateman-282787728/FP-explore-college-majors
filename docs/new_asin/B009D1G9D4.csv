8539840,5,B009D1G9D4,"This 3D is so fabulous that I was totally into the safari movie I haven't seen the other yet!  The safari movie is long, but I enjoyed every moment of it!",1404518400,,154,3.967741935483871
8539841,4,B009D1G9D4,Very enjoyable movies.  I am not disappointed with the purchase at all.  A nice addition to every 3D movie collection.,1385769600,,118,4.85
8539842,5,B009D1G9D4,"A really breathtaking way to view Africa!! I've been on safari and it is just like being there. With this documentary you really get a sense of the landscape, the beauty of the animals and the majesty of nature.  Add Hunter Ellis and it's a real gem - plus I got them both for a great price!",1364774400,,291,4.105263157894737
8539843,5,B009D1G9D4,"I had a chance to check out both of these 3D titles and while they're admittedly quite similar in content, this is an AMAZING deal!  JILLIAN'S TRAVELS is clearly much more geared to the kiddies who want to see African animals in 3D but 3D SAFARI AFRICA is really for a general audience -- something adults can easily enjoy along with the kids.  It's really worth it just for 3D SAFARI which is a very high quality ""travelogue"" of safari in Africa with incredible footage in 3D.  Keep in mind, if you DON'T have a 3D TV & 3D Blu-Ray player, it will automatically play in stunning HD only (not in 3D).  But if you have the full set up, both movies will play automatically in top quality 3D.  Animal lovers, 3D fans, armchair travelers should not miss out on this awesome deal!",1350604800,2,774,4.384615384615385
