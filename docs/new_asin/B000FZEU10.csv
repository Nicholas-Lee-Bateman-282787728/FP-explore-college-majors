the idea of channeling your anger into something destructive is portrayed in a good way. Terrorism can come from any kinds of frustration be it religious, emotional or just the mere feeling of injustice.

However you get the feeling that it was filmed using someone's video camera and with no settings at all. Maybe that's what makes the movie even more realistic.",1163980800,,481,4.517241379310345

When my friend put it in and I started watching I thought I knew exactly where it was headed and thought it was going to be a standard formula. This happened about 3 times thru the entire movie and everytime I was fooled and suprised. By the end I really was suprised and I really found that I enjoyed this movie. It was refreshing that somebody can and will take chances and break the usual hollywood formula. Robin Wright Penn, the only person I had heard of in the movie, was just great.

2593663,4,B000FZEU10,"Unfortunately we don't see very much of Robin Wright Penn; she's like a rare vintage wine, and you savor what little you get.  In a movie full of twists and turns, Penn has us going as a high-powered exec, then a lowly number-cruncher, followed by a psycho terrorist, then suddenly she is a vulnerable sweatheart on the verge of redemption, followed by a cold-blooded psychopath.  Sybil cannot compete with Robin Wright Penn; and that is giving away too much.  To enjoy the full effect of the movie, it is better to take it at face value and just follow along to be astounded by the depth of disturbance that 9/11 could create in one individual.

So we're five years on from 9/11 now.  Big Hollywood is coming out with its exploitation flicks.  Having seen none of the forthcoming productions, I will reserve judgement, but did Nick Cage really need to go there?  What we have in ""Sorry, Haters"" is something far more personal and downstream, a really complex  9/11 ramification that somehow transmogrifies a victim into a victimizer.  The film's final twist may have been unnecessary, but at least the writer/director was able to one-up a savvy audience and went places that you just could not see coming.  The movie is helped considerably by excellent supporting roles, Abdellatif Kechiche and Sandrah Oh shine in a tightly scripted nail-biter.",1156032000,16,1346,4.864035087719298

2593665,4,B000FZEU10,"Robin Wright Penn.

Robin Wright Penn.

The reason to watch this movie is Robin Wright Penn.

Penn plays a woman who, in post-9/11 New York, longs to reproduce the feeling she felt on that great day. Penn's character has fears, insecurities, and all kinds of issues that make her long for the safety and comfort she experienced on September 11, 2001. This movie does a great job of illustrating how that great and tragic day meant different things to different people. And as crazy as it may sound to some of us, there were actually people (non-terrorists/non ""haters of America and the freedom that she stands for"") who took some degree of comfort in the chaos and terror of that day. Penn's character is one of those people. And as we come to understand who she is (and who she isn't) we find ourselves feeling a combination of absolute disgust and quiet pity that could only be produced by an actress as talented as Robin Wright Penn.

""Sorry Haters"" makes you think about September 11, in a way you might never have otherwise considered. It makes you think about American culture and how isolating and lonely it can be. And it also makes you think about personal responsibility and the culture of victimhood that is so pervasive in our society today. It accomplishes all of these things through Robin Wright Penn. And to see her amazing performance is reason enough to watch this movie.",1155772800,3,1390,4.684426229508197
2593666,3,B000FZEU10,"This independent drama tells the story of a Muslim cab driver, Ashade, who picks up a white woman named Philly outside local hip hop television station Q-Dog TV. She has him drive her around New York and gets him deeply involved in her troubled life. When she finds out Ashade's brother has been expedited to Syria for a crime he didn't commit, Philly stirs the pot by telling Ashade that if he helps her with her plot to do something radical in post-9/11 New York that she'll help him get his brother released.

Robin Wright Penn is excellent as the troubled and disturbed white woman who wants to blame everyone else in the world for her problems, and I can't help but feel sorry for her at the same time I despise her.  In a time when movies like Crash are being heralded for ""telling the truth"" and saying what other people are afraid to, Sorry, Haters fits right in.  I mean, this is a movie that was originally known as ""Untitled Post-9/11 Cab Drama.""  Sorry, Haters is worth watching, but I can't quite accept that the bleak picture this movie paints for the state of race relations in America is realistic.",1155686400,,1114,4.5
2593687,2,B000FZEU10,"Inconsistant, but it does keep you riveted to your seat. Robin Wright Penn has her moments in this film, and those moments are pretty creepy. However, this film was entirely unfocused and awkward at times, and while it attempted to be unique and original, this subject matter has been explored before in other films...and with much better results, I might add. The ending is one BIG cliche. See only for Robin Wright Penn's performance.",1207094400,,436,4.905405405405405
2593688,1,B000FZEU10,"Phoebe (Robin Wright Penn), a divorced and detached staffer for a New York based, MTV style music video network, longs for the mood and feeling of 9/11--most especially for the way her self-absorbed boss Phyllis (Sandra Oh) had relied on her for emotional support back then.  Trouble begins when Syrian-born cabdriver Ashade (actor/director Abdellatif Kechiche) picks up Phoebe and he tells her about his family's problems.  Phoebe starts deceiving Ashade, letting him think she can help get his innocent brother released from detention in Guantanamo.  After Ashade realizes Phoebe's mental instability and consequently distances himself from her, Phoebe turns ugly and plots revenge upon the Middle Easterner, and his French-Canadian sister-in-law (Eloise Bouchez), who is illegally resident in this country, as well.

SORRY, HATERS actually could have been a good psychodrama if it wasn't such an arty and self-indulgent mess.  Being shot within in little over two weeks with a DV recorder, it stylistically has the feel of an amateur film posted on YouTube.  Robin Wright Penn seems very uncomfortable in her role, looking in several scenes as if she's saying ""What am I doing here?"" to herself.  Kechiche's lines are simply incomprehensible, mumbling in broken English and yelling in Arabic (while subtitles are provided for the Arabic dialogue, I suggest you activate your close captioning for whenever this guy speaks).  Moreover, Kechiche, a Tunisian, is seriously miscast; Syrians, like the Lebanese, have much Greek, Roman, and Armenian blood flowing through their veins, and are generally more fair-skinned than this actor (think of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad).  For some reason Americans--regardless of whichever end of the political spectrum they congregate--feel this need to stress the notion of color difference into our dealings with Muslims, despite those differences being slight and, for the most part, illusory.

What is most disturbing, however, is the attempt SORRY, HATERS makes to force upon sane and rational viewers its message that we Americans are really the nihilistic predators and terrorizers.  As with many nowadays who are socially and politcally left-of-center, it wants for us to acknowledge our society's consumerist ambitions, in combination with increased emotional alienation and self-loathing, as something as hateful and destructive as any extreme Islamist ideology.

Speaking of self-loathing, this movie's writer and director, Jeff Stanzler, is overwhelmed by it.  There is some major--albeit confused--contempt for the trendy and the 'progressive,' who, assumedly, inhabit Stanzler's personal and professional life.  Naturally, a man as devout as Ashade (who keeps to his ablutions and prayers under even the most stressful situations) doesn't merely enter into some sort of relationship with a strange middle-aged American woman, he also handles dogs, allows alcohol in his home  and, better yet, recognizes and supports his brother's kafir wife.  Yes, of course, we do have the gratuitous scene of thuggish Homeland Security agents copping cheap feels (naturally) off of Ashade's homely sister-in-law after she passes out from interrogation.  But it's those characters and types, otherwise often favorably portrayed in independent films such as this, which are the real targets of Stanzler's disdain:  Phoebe's boss, Phyllis MacIntyre, the head of a major cable music channel, is married to a slight and diminutive house husband, complete with downy beard and a moptop of hair.  Stanzler shows Phyllis to be mercenary and a narcissist, producing violent, expletive-ridden rap videos, but whose top rated program, ""Sorry, Haters,"" a CRIBS-style reality show that glorifies the ghetto fabulous and all things crass and materialistic.  Most poignant of all, however, is the type of woman that is Phoebe herself.  While Phoebe is portrayed as a successful middle-aged professional, she is also emotionally stunted; a woman who compensates for her ex-husband having full custody of their daughter by doting over her little lapdog and yearning to recapture that moment when Phyllis (who Phoebe despises otherwise) was afraid that the terrorists were coming to get her next and looked to her for security and comfort.  Such women once represented the feminist ideal, but Stanzler reduces them to parodies, making it seem as if they are symptomatic of the West's decadence and dysfunction that is polluting the rest of the world. He also seems to be saying that it is from women such as these that men such as Ashade or even the 9/11 hijackers must struggle against with their pious purity.  Such sentiments are a disgrace and are as spit in the face of every New Yorker who suffered through that day, regardless of whatever their lifestyles or politics.  Others may wonder what it would take to make a Jeff Stanzler understand the trauma and loss of that day.  Unfortunately, the Jeff Stanzlers of this country do understand, and they just don't care.

Now about the little dog...Stanzler makes a really cheap shot at the very end with that little pooch.  While it is quite unlikely, if I ever come across the man he's got a slap to the back of his head coming from me over the sick finale to this sorry mess of a movie, which stinks worse than a well used port-a-potty on a summer's hottest day.",1193443200,19,5340,5.311163895486936
2593689,4,B000FZEU10,"Haha, this is not a pleasant movie to sit through but it boggles my mind how the filmmaker captured a very important type of ""New Yorker.""  I also once again am startled by Sandra Oh.  I've seen her in that Chinese Canadian movie, Dancing at the Blue Iguana, Hard Candy and this movie and for some reason, I feel like Sandra Oh's gaze is reaching out of the tv screen and touching my face.  She's scary smart and I feel her strength in a movie even when her role is not a large one.

I think Robin Wright is a really interesting actress and a really impressive physical presence.  I think she's kind of sneaky in what she is doing but this is not a good movie to stare at her and ponder what the actor is doing to us because I feel that if I look too hard at what she is doing, I will be singed.",1192752000,,795,4.006329113924051

The 2 lead actors and the French sister-in-law are great.  But even they can't save this mess from a director who obviously thinks that any stupid idea that he comes up with is flowing with artisitic brilliance. By the time the viewer is hit with his surprises toward the end, you just don't care that much because this film has already had more twists than a Chubby Checker concert and the characters are not that well developed.  As someone who was at Ground Zero and traumatized by that experience I came away feeling cheated and offended by yet another retarded attempt to cash in on the tragedy.  I thought this was going somewhere interesting when the female lead starts talking about her experience that day but unfortunately this ends up being as shameless and pointless as Nicolas Cage in World Trade Center.  It's nothing more than a typical film school homework project minus the lesbians and black and white film.",1182643200,3,1059,4.733695652173913
2593691,2,B000FZEU10,"This film is so full of cliches and rediculous scenes that it makes one want to cry.  The 'religious' Syrian Muslim man grabbing dogs and allowing alcohol in his house, his uncovered sister in law who looks and speaks french, the screaming white women who is really 'crazy' and allows herself to be molested and beaten and that takes part in self mutilation.  This is just a rediculous film that in its weak attempts to 'explode prejudice' and 'deal with 9/11' fails miserably.

The director evidently felt that by making the film complicated and giving it 'twists and turns' and trying to be unpredictable that this would solve the problem of the characters, neither of which are realistic or honest.  The only thing slightly honest is that the 'religious' Muslim wants to marry the western businesswoman and that she in turn is inticed by her own racist orientalism.

I love and own this movie but you may feel repulsed by Robin Wright Penn's character, Phoebe.  This film is psychological drama.  Miss Penn plays a highly disturbed single, jealous, manipulative individual living in New York City.

Penn's character hides these traits with a mousey, shy and indifferent demeanor. But wait, her personality is ever changing.  From the beginning of the film you're trying to figure her character out along with an innocent taxi driver, played by Abdel Kechiche.

Some feel Robin's character became ill because of 911, I think she was already sick prior to the event and uses it to feed her psychosis.  However you may interpret this movie you won't forget the alarming brutality of this film.

When businesswoman Phoebe (Penn) hops into a cab driven by the Arabic Ashade (Kechiche) neither he nor the audience could possibly predict where this cab drive will lead. Along the way we meet Eloise (Bouchez), Ashade's sister-in-law, who is struggling to provide assistance to her husband, who was deported from the country after running afoul of the heightened post 9/11 security procedures at the airport. There is also Phyllis (Sandra Oh) Phoebe's co-worker, who is unaware of the drama unfolding around her.

Stanzler wrote SORRY, HATERS (the title comes from an MTV-like network's reality show) in response to the emotional impact of the terrorist attacks of 9/11 on ordinary residents of New York City. His screenplay is complex and surprising, but with much more depth than some of the twists and turns might suggest. The acting by Kechiche, Bouchez, and Oh is top-notch, but it's Robin Wright Penn who truly shines in SORRY, HATERS and her fearless, powerful performance will leave you breathless.",1171929600,19,1192,5.02020202020202
2593695,4,B000FZEU10,"I haven't been so disturbed by a character in a film, since Robert DeNiro played Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver.  Robin Wright Penn is Phoebe, a woman traumatized by the events of 9/11.  Ashade--played by Abdel Kechiche--is a devout Muslim man whose brother has been incarcerated by our government for suspicious activities.

We meet Ashade as he desperately tries to raise funds for a lawyer, in order to free his brother.  His attraction to his brother's wife complicates matters, leaving him guilt-ridden and shameful.  Events are set into motion when Phoebe, a woman on the brink, gets into his taxi.

The nuanced script, written and directed by Jeff Stanzler, builds tension perfectly as Ashade is drawn deeper into Phoebe's madness and escalating purpose.  The helplessness of his situation is palpable.  Penn's performance is pitch-perfect as Phoebe, a semi-psychotic woman, who is looking for a way to matter.  She embodies Phoebe's restlessness, and need to be acknowledged, perfectly; alternating between normalcy, insanity, and curiously, kindness, beautifully.  We are powerless as we watch Phoebe's ties to reality dissolve, tangling the desperate and gullible Ashade, further into her dysfunctional lies.

Penn's performance as Phoebe left me inexplicably anxious. Thought-provoking and disturbing, this film will haunt you long after the final credits.",1168819200,6,1365,5.514423076923077

They are served when the playing field of those whom they envy becomes leveled by chaos. The anti hero played by Robin Wright Penn is the definitive portrait of this dark side of the revolutionary spirit, finding her strength in performing acts of terror.

8127864,3,B000FZEU10,"Sorry, Haters is a really twisted take on the rocky relationship between the Americans and Muslims.  Before writing my review let me state that I probably didn't get the movie overall.  At least, the second half totally went over my head.

What initially appears to be an American woman out for revenge with a short-sighted attitude problem and demanding that a Muslim cab driver take her wherever she desires to go (and willing to pay the guy a large sum of money to make it possible) we soon discover that the storyline is much deeper than that.  Eventually the Muslim takes a temporary stop at a house with a woman and small child, and the woman comes with him, basically invites herself in, and they communicate about how terrible the United States is.  We learn the woman and child are the family of the cab drivers brother.

Eventually the discussion concerning the brother becomes an important aspect of the storyline and the woman tries to rationalize by carrying a decent conversation over what should be done about freeing the cab drivers brother, but... well for one thing we never see the brother.  It's all talk.  Second of all, the storyline changes into a different and WAY more confusing direction just as soon as we discover the woman snuck her way through the Muslims belongings and somehow took 500 bucks from the guy.  Actually right before this it would seem the woman set up a perfect trap so the Muslim couldn't escape at the top of a building after locking him up there with nowhere to go, but she -much to MY surprise at least- ends up giving him the door password, lets him run free, and then he's seen on the streets running from the security guards.  From here on out, the discussion over the brother is pushed aside (unless I missed something).

Now the storyline turns *much* worse as the communication between the woman and the Muslim is never really fully understood until the very end, and even THEN I'm not sure what to make of it other than the woman has psychotic tendencies and had the Muslim guy completely under her spell the entire time.  I don't want to give away what happens at the *very* end though- two surprises actually, both of which are major and inappropriate to spoil for the readers.

Overall, well just understand that the woman has mental issues and she's not capable of rationalizing and sympathizing like a normal human being and perhaps THEN the storyline will make better sense.  Otherwise the acting is decent, and it's a pretty decent film overall.  No it's not a typical ""Americans vs. Muslims"" type of storyline, but that doesn't excuse the confusion mainly thanks to the woman who plays the lead character.  Again, we'll just assume it's the woman who's at fault the entire time and is actually the bad person, and that's the twist the movie writers were going for.  During a time when the average American didn't know how to approach the Muslim community, the film writers wanted to take the issue from a different angle and offer surprising twists and turns.  I believe this is the case with Sorry, Haters.  The only problem is, again, the confusing way the story is told.",1330214400,,3137,4.681238615664845

The acting is splendid, and the underlying message is quite profound, although I must admit, I am still wrestling with the movie's true message. Irrespective, it's entertaining, intelligent. I gave it a 4, only because at certain times, Kechiche's elocution was  not fully clear. It really deserves a 5 for everything else.",1302912000,,533,5.270588235294118

I'm pleasantly surprised that finally an American movie portrays goodness in Muslims. While others are criticizing the movie for showing unbelievable evil in humans, I think that a movie needs to use some extra measures to show the contrast between good and evil, or as Buddha once put it: ""There has to be evil so that good can prove its purity above it.

We will presume him to be innocent, but the cab driver is certain he is innocent and only wants to help his brother. He doesn't hate America in spite of what has happened.

A woman gets into his cab, clearly upset about her own personal issues. She asks to be driven downtown and has the cab driver park outside a house where she cries when she sees a man, woman, and child arriving home. She keys the car, and then shows the cab driver a picture of the man, woman, and child, with herself. She says she is a producer of Reality TV Shows, like ""Sorry, Haters,"" a show that displays the lavish lifestyles of rappers to induce envy in viewers. Her husband is an artist, and the woman is their nanny; but she and her husband are estranged, and he is now with the nanny.

The cab driver is anxious to get home, as he needs to bring some money to his brother's wife. She is not ready to go home. He will drive her around, but needs to make a quick stop. As he is talking to his brother's wife, she barges in and intrudes on their life. On hearing about his brother's plight, she offers to try to get him a lawyer, but instead she steals the money he has saved to help him. His situation goes from bad to worse. He goes back to her office to find out why she pretended to want to help him, but then went about trying to destroy him.

The film doesn't really answer this riddle, but we do learn that Phoebe was not really who she said she was. She has more baggage than a sky cap the day before Thanksgiving. The tag for this film was: The dust has finally settled... for most of us. It delves into the anxieties and fears we have in a post 9/11 America, and also tackles the equally perplexing problems of loneliness, alienation, and mental illness. The film seems prescient about certain events like the arrest of Jihad Jane.

This indie film was shot in 15 days and takes on many complex and troubling issues. It doesn't really attempt to answer any of the questions it raises, but it does make you think about them. This film is not for everyone. It eschews the happy ending. Does it ever. Robin Penn Wright gives an incredible performance. She has come a long way since Princess Buttercup in The Princess Bride.

8127868,5,B000FZEU10,"This is one of the most frustrating films I'd seen in a long time. Poor Ashade (a wonderful Abdel Kechiche) is a cab driver who knows that the fare he'd picked up (Penn's Phoebe) has issues. Without giving anything away, it's Phoebe who takes HIM on a ride. This is a frustrating film, and brilliant in its final scene. The beautiful Mrs. Penn has been less than gorgeous in films like ""She's So Lovely"" and ""Forrest Gump"", but here, she's gorgeous on the outside and ever so ugly inside. Aside from the brilliantly conceived characters, it's important to know that there are some Muslims in America that are moral and good; unlike other crazies who think they have all the answers. It centers on 9/11 and shows that anyone with a crazy agenda can cause havoc. Amazing film. Definitely worth viewing; nominated for some Indie Spirit Awards, including Mrs. Penn. Thought provoking and disturbing; I'm glad I rented it.",1247529600,,917,4.773584905660377
8127869,2,B000FZEU10,"The premise is brilliant, but poor executed.
Anyways, good acting by Robin Wright(Phoebe) as the crazy white lady. Can people be that evil? I'm sure they can be- but it is very,very rare. My advice to cabbies: Its OK to talk to your customers, especially crazy young women-They probably won't be out to kill you.
I couldn't take the movie in a single sitting-which is a bad sign for any movie.
sorry 2 stars. Great acting by all actors, though!",1230076800,,444,4.5625
