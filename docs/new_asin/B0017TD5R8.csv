Not only does she enjoy watching it, but it has helped us so much with getting her to bath without crying and let us brush her hair without a fuss. We point out how happy the children on the movie are when they get their hair washed or brushed, and Haven wants to behave ""Like on Doing Things!"" We highly recommend this movie!",1242432000,,357,4.264705882352941
8558149,5,B0017TD5R8,"My three year old daughter loves this video!  It has a very simple premise:  showing kids doing everyday things.  Yet, the manner in which it is conveyed is lively and interesting, but not overly stimulating.  The  musical score is made up of familiar tunes (""Do Your Ears Hang  Low?""  ""This is the Way We..."" and many more), but there are  no lyrics, so it's not a ""sing-a-long.""  The preschool-age  children are shown interacting with animals, other children and adults as  they move through their daily routines of eating, washing and playing.  The  running time, 27 min., is just right.  I highly recommend this video!  Your  toddler or preschooler will love it!",961286400,6,666,4.864864864864865
