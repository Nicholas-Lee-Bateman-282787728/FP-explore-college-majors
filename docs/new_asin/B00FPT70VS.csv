6019609,4,B00FPT70VS,"At that time Roberto Duran, with his ""demonic, black-coal eyes"" and his bullywing ways and his destructive ""manos de piedras,"" was considered the meanest man in boxing. One colorful quote builds up his legend: ""He is said to have knocked out a woman and a horse, each with one punch."" And at that time ""Sugar"" Ray Leonard was viewed as America's golden boy of boxing, pretty and always smiling and slick, man, slick. Sugar Ray was poised to take over from an aging Ali as the face of the sweet science.

In the 1980s, these two, along with Tommy Hearns and Marvin Hagler and undoubtedly others I'm forgetting right now, ushered in a contemporary golden age in the neighborhood of boxing. Duran, Leonard, Hearns, and Hagler engaged in a vicious crosspolination in the squared circle. And if those three hellified rounds that Hearns and Hagler fought are the most exciting three rounds ever, then the first rematch between Duran and Leonard - or, specifically, how that ended - has to be the most enigmatic. This ESPN 30 For 30 documentary examines the notorious ""No Mas"" fight.

Their first fight was a barnburner, was even hyped up as a ""fight of the century"" type. Mike Tyson reveals that that fight inspired him to become a boxer. And it lived up to the hype. Leonard did a dumb thing by deciding to go toe to toe with Duran. In the documentary Leonard admitted that, going into that fight, Duran had gotten to his head, that he had allowed the arrogant Panamanian to intimidate him. And so Ray felt he had something to prove. If nothing else, even though he lost to Duran, Sugar Ray Leonard demonstrated that he was a real fighter. In Montreal, on June 20, 1980, he absorbed some truly murderous shots. There'd been doubts, remember? Guy was too slick, too pretty, clowned around, hadn't fought anyone before Duran. Ray forever killed that noise.

It's a riveting documentary, but that's normal with these ESPN 30 for 30 projects. I'd seen Duran vs. Leonard I in its totality several times. But I'd only ever seen snippets of the ""No Mas"" fight, and, no, this documentary doesn't roll out the entire match. The hook is in how this piece sets up the backdrop and explores the behind-the-scenes stuff thru interviews and archival footage, not only for the ""No Mas"" fight but for the first fight as well. It breaks down how the mutual animosity between Duran and Leonard developed. It's a fascinating watch for both diehard and casual sports fans. And there's always that extra tweak of spotting younger incarnations of Al Michaels, Tom Brokaw, and, yep, Christie Brinkley. Apparently, Brinkley wasn't only a supermodel, she was a devoted photographer and was given access to click away during the ""No Mas"" event.

Unexpected. Inexplicable. Who knows what was going thru Duran's mind when he quit in the eight round of a championship fight? The film examines the fallout to what he done: the stigmatization of Duran in his very own country (where his house was stoned), the mass speculating, and the parade of excuses. Duran's puzzling actions overshadowed Leonard's masterful performance, and the film splices in Leonard's angst as the focus of the present-day narrative. I don't know if I buy that, after all this time, Sugar Ray was still agonizing over why Duran quit. I don't know that it bothered him so much that he was willing to fly to Panama for what turned out to be an awkward reunion with Duran, just to ask him that question to his face. And then when Duran asks him why he made him wait ten years for a third fight, it's Leonard's turn to hem and haw. But never mind. The meat of the documentary - the bits that transplant you back in time to one of the most peculiar, most memorable exhibitions of organized violence in contemporary era - that's what's worth tuning in for. As for why Duran quit, I don't think it's such a mystery. Macho bully getting mocked and shown up and boxed silly by an opponent he couldn't catch to land on and the people ringside laughing at him, the humiliation was too much.",1382054400,9,4018,4.686968838526912

8617777,4,B00FPT70VS,"As the era of Mohamed Ali wound down I found myself paying less and less attention to boxing. I vaguely remember this saga but barely past the headline and soundbyte level. This documentary filled in the gaps quite well.

Here's the scoop. The first time Sugar Ray Leonard and Roberto Duran met in the ring, Duran won on a decision. They met again a few months later for a rematch and Duran quit simply ""quit"" in the 8th round which made him a disgrace and left Leonard dissatisfied because the press went after Duran's loss as opposed to his win. This examines the behind the scenes of the entire saga.

This is pretty cool. You get commentary from all manner of boxing folk. Fight magazine reporters and editors, trainers from both corners, promoters and even Christie Brinkley who was on hand as photographer and general hanger on. They waltz you through both bouts and give good profiles of both fighters through words, headlines and film footage. Duran is depicted as a bad guy. He hated Leonard and wanted to knock him off the throne. If what they say here is true he was an uncouth, mean-spirited, thug. Leonard, on the other hand, is shown as a genuinely decent guy. Well liked and personable. He even openly speaks of the uneasiness/fear he experienced the first time stepped into the ring with Duran. So when the the two fights are juxtaposed the turnaround is striking. Seeing Duran not only lose his cockiness but simply walk away from the fight is shocking.

Alas the issue isn't really resolved. They show that there is no question Duran was not ready for this bout. His initial win led to months of abusing his body with food and booze, and simply did not block out enough time to get back to where he needed to be. He supposedly dosed heavy with diarrhetics to drop the 40 plus pounds needed to meet the weight requirements and, when he weighed in correctly, went on an immediate eating binge right before the fight. If true, he might have had the stomach cramps he spoke of. Be that as it may. His complaint sat well with no one.

This moves along well until near the end. There is a final meeting between the two men where Leonard tries to coax the truth from Duran but gets the same story he got decades before. So Leonard and the viewer are no better satisfied. The whole film rather peters out in the last 10 or so minutes.. Given that, this is still a nifty piece of work.",1415750400,3,2394,4.496551724137931
8617778,3,B00FPT70VS,"Recalling the November 25, 1980, Roberto Duran-Ray Leonard championship boxing match, a sports event as talked about as any, the 2013 E.S.P.N. television documentary NO MAS leaves it up to the viewer to decide if loser Duran quit in the 8th round because  there was no solving Leonard or, as he claims to this day, he was sick. As this film depicts, his fallen opponent's refusal to admit the former irks Leonard to this day.

My question to both gentlemen: Who cares?  And maybe that's what the filmmakers want to say, as NO MAS reminds us that outside of that crazy fight Leonard and Duran were not exactly bums, before and after 1980.  The only argument: Does the short list on which they belong comprise either the best fighters of that era or of all time?

If Roberto Duran's coming my way, let me know so I can have a head start running but it seems to me that he quit out of frustration, not a stomach ache.  See NO MAS and decide for yourself.",1415750400,,951,4.405714285714286
