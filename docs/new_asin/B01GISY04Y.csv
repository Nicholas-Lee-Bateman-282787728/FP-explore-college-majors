8762990,1,B01GISY04Y,"This is a review of the Serpent Films edition, UPC 889290932440. The visual quality is at least as bad as the Nostalgia Family edition, UPC 644827319725, if not worse. It's also shorter than the Nostalgia Family edition: 83:22 vs. 87:01. I'd avoid this one, though the other is itself nothing to write home about. One wishes somebody would go to the trouble to find original 35mm film elements of this diverting detective mystery-comedy to make a really decent transfer (same goes for the other two Inspector Hornleigh films).",1491177600,8,526,4.988636363636363
