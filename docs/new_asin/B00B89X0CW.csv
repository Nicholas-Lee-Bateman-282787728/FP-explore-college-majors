5562996,5,B00B89X0CW,"I have watched all 3 seasons on Netflix twice and just love them.  I can't believe it ended after three seasons, but would love to own this series.  I don't understand why it is still so expensive.  The price hasn't budged in months since I added it to my Wish List.  Can anyone tell me?",1379894400,15,287,4.163636363636364
5562997,5,B00B89X0CW,Was glad to find the whole set to purchase.  Series has been cancelled.  Don't understand why.  I really enjoy this show and couldn't find more than a few to watch on the internet.,1375315200,17,180,4.393939393939394
5562998,5,B00B89X0CW,"I loved this series and Stephen Fry is such a good actor.  The people in this series were endearing and I could watch this over and over again.  I recommend it to everyone who is a fan of British TV (or anyone for that matter.)  It's warm, funny and extremely likable.

5562999,5,B00B89X0CW,We thoroughly enjoyed this series. Was looking forward to viewing it and further seasons. Was a  trifle miffed (an understatement) that it was canceled after only 3 seasons.,1371254400,4,173,5.178571428571429
5563000,5,B00B89X0CW,We find that viewers are universally unhappy with the failure of the Producers to follow on with a fourth seadon.,1369699200,4,113,4.7
5563001,4,B00B89X0CW,"It took me a while to warm up to this series, but eventually,  I came to appreciate it and now even find it funny and entertaining.  Unlike the average American sitcom/drama,  the characters are much more likable.",1457481600,,213,4.702702702702703
5563002,5,B00B89X0CW,great humor and fabulous characters. Will never get tired of watching it.,1456790400,,73,5.166666666666667
5563003,5,B00B89X0CW,Just found this delightful show.  Wonderful quirky characters.  Nice balance of drama and comedy.  I was left wanting more episodes.  I just don't get these tv companies they always kill off good shows too soon.,1454198400,,211,4.942857142857143
5563004,5,B00B89X0CW,"This excellent series has it all: humor and drama in well-balanced doses, appealing characters, a strong regional flavor, and cinematography that is frequently impressive. Stephen Fry (as Peter Kingdom) is superb as a very gifted legal professional who settled for a quiet rural venue for his practice. Peter's office mates, his off-kilter siblings, and some distinctly unique local ""characters"" are all likable and often unpredictable. There's an interesting plot line that serves as a continuous, unifying thread throughout the series (won't spoil it for you with specifics), but unfortunately it is abruptly (and seemingly prematurely) severed near the end of the series' final season. The final insult to this injury is the cancellation of the series just as it is revealed (in plot) that the main character has a dark secret revealed to him in harshly cruel manner. It's obvious that, seeing the writing on the wall, the series' writing talents were beginning to abandon ship just before the last three episodes, and so the respective plot lines appear to have been constructed hastily and feel out of place with the overall tone of the series. However, you shouldn't let this unfortunate ending deter you from viewing what is otherwise an excellent example of quality British television.",1453248000,6,1293,5.251207729468599
5563005,5,B00B89X0CW,"The most heart warming DVD. If you love eccentric characters and unconditional love in a quirky village on the coast of england, this one is for you. Just a delight to view.",1449792000,,173,4.4375
5563006,5,B00B89X0CW,"I love this series & Stephen Fry as Kingdom!  My only complaint (potential ""spoiler alert"") is that it ends in a very ambiguous way.... Such a shame because the characters are quirky, interesting, & even those you don't like, at first, become favorites. People grow & change, just like we all do...., that's uncommon in most series.",1447632000,2,332,4.824561403508772

5563009,4,B00B89X0CW,"This series is very entertaining. The characters are interesting, human (flawed) and well developed. The plots contain humor, pathos, and surprise twists. The acting is superb. The only reason that I am giving it four stars instead of five is that I had difficulty figuring out how to get the first two discs to play (hit ""menu"" as soon as the disc has loaded or you will get nothing) and the disc skipped in the middle of one the last episodes of the third series so that I was able to view the beginning and the end of the episode, but not the middle of it.",1445558400,,559,4.283018867924528
5563010,4,B00B89X0CW,"It would have gotten 5 stars but something was rattling and a dvd wasn't seated so I had to open all of the packaging (it is a gift) to make sure the dvd wasn't broken. The rattling was one of the tabs in one of the cases broke off, but the dvd was fine.",1444089600,,254,3.7222222222222223
5563011,5,B00B89X0CW,"The outstanding British actor and writer Stephen Fry is able to masterfully play image of any character. In this series he played the role of a provincial lawyer who loves and seeks to bring any matter to the end. Attorney Peter Kingdom seems to melancholic and peaceful man. Actually, his witty mind, he is a very observant person and a professional in the business. For him there are selected cases. He gladly accepted for the investigation of any case and always gets it started to end. This series has pleased me with unexpected twists plots and original idea.",1443398400,,564,4.76530612244898

5563015,5,B00B89X0CW,"Enjoyed this series very much. Sorry it only lasted for three years.
Would have wanted to see more. BBC always has a knack to abort
their programming. Grateful for these episodes. Stephen Fry is a gem,
as is Celia Imrie and a wonderful supporting cast giving us a truly witty,
compassionate story lines. But to keep us hanging as to whom is Peter.......
well, another season could have given viewers a better understanding of
Kingdom. But in the end Peter held it all together.",1434585600,,477,4.690476190476191
5563016,5,B00B89X0CW,"Highly recommended if you like quirky British comedy and excellent acting.  Stephen Fry plays the lawyer, Kingdom, in a nice understated comedic way.  Ditto for the other characters, especially his articling student sidekick.  It's not entirely comedy - there is some well done family drama as well.",1433030400,,299,5.319148936170213

5563029,5,B00B89X0CW,This is a British series that didn't get much play in US.  It is funny with some of UK's best actors.  It also has a long running mystery.,1410566400,,138,3.892857142857143
5563030,5,B00B89X0CW,"Damn, another really good series that just leaves one hanging.  I wish I had known prior to getting into this, that I would be left wondering.  Why must this always happen?  At least give us one final, conclusive episode to tie up loose ends.  I don't mean, "" and they all lived happily ever, after."" either.",1410134400,9,308,4.446428571428571

5563032,5,B00B89X0CW,"This was such a good series to watch!  I really wish it hadn't been canceled, it left off at a real bombshell IMO. The only qualms I have with this set is that the sound of the music is really loud in comparison to the voices of the actors, so it got difficult to understand what people were saying over the music.  I watched this with my Mother who is hearing impaired and the first season had closed captioning, but the other two did not.  It was a good series though, but if you're hearing impaired, it might be a bit difficult to understand at times.",1402963200,2,554,4.2075471698113205

5563034,4,B00B89X0CW,"It's clever, funny, great acting, quirky characters. I'm really sorry it got cancelled. The last episode had quite the cliff hanger and now we'll never know. Stephen Fry is amazing. His character is compassionate, intelligent, insightful and strangely asexual so there are no romantic distractions from his intrinsic goodness. I would highly recommend this if you want a good and reassuring watch. Sue",1395014400,12,401,5.380952380952381
5563035,5,B00B89X0CW,"Peter Kingdom.

He's compassionate, wise and, sometimes, a wise-ass. What a perfect blend of character traits for this charming Brit! The cast of characters is equally appealing and I will be recommending this series for as long as I have breath in me. Just buy the entire series and thank me later. Oh, and he drives a 1967 Alvis to and from his client meetings. Gorgeous colour photography (sorry - couldn't resist) throughout.

5563036,5,B00B89X0CW,"My family and I watched Kingdom on Netflix, but then it wasn't available any longer.  We purchased the whole set, and continue to enjoy it.  We are big fans of Stephen Fry.  Thank you -- speedy service, wonderful show.  :)",1391212800,2,222,4.475
5563037,5,B00B89X0CW,"Fry's immense talent is well supported with a delightful cast, top-notch writing, and gently quirky characters. This series has a similar flow and depth that graces the popular Doc Martin, but with Fry as lawyer at the helm, there is an attractive refinement, empathy and kindness where Martin is dour and curmudgeonly (albeit fun to watch!). I will be watching all three seasons in this series many times.",1389052800,,406,4.985294117647059
5563038,5,B00B89X0CW,Wonderful series. Really enjoyed it except I would have loved to see a fourth season to see who Peter was. His past.,1384041600,10,116,4.318181818181818
5563039,5,B00B89X0CW,"This is well worth the money.  It is witty, warm and fun throughout.  Played by fine actors in all parts,(Stephen Fry is  outstanding), it is pure pleasure.  So, of course, it was dropped!  Still what we have is worth the price.",1382313600,18,228,4.463414634146342
5563040,5,B00B89X0CW,"What a lovely, refreshing surprise!  It is unexpected to find superb storylines, witty and thoughtful writing, and an excellent cast amongst current offerings....but that is exactly what ""Kingdom"" delivers.  Stephen Fry and Celia Imrie are wonderful and the series is charming and engaging throughout.  I have watched it several times and shared it with friends....I only wish there had been more!",1381536000,26,397,5.475409836065574

8564063,4,B00B89X0CW,"A very quiet, gentle series with some of the funniest lines I've ever heard.  The humor is subtle, the plots sort of simplistic; just the sort of thing you want to watch on a Sunday afternoon or evening.  As another reviewer has said, though, only the first series is close-captioned.  Why they didn't do all three discs is beyond me.",1476576000,,334,4.533333333333333
