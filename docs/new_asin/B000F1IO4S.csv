8200071,5,B000F1IO4S,"I remember seeing the trailer for Sunday Driver, born and raised in Watts. If your from Los Angeles area then you know how serious our car culture is. Lowriding is the birthplace in my opinion. It's very popular in Chicano culture. It was interesting to see the whole entire story of the majestics car club. The dvd is packed from beginning to end, something I look for in documentaries, you really get your moneys worth with this dvd. Everything from the dvd artwork, production, and special features. If for some reason one of my friends doesn't know about lowriders, I just put this dvd on to educate them. There is nothing like this on the market, that's why I always love watching it. Every since Boyz N The Hood came out, and seeing Doughboy's impala, I was hooked.

Overall if you enjoy lowriders, I highly suggest buying this dvd.",1334448000,,838,4.624161073825503
8200072,4,B000F1IO4S,"Pretty interesting documentary, lots of colorful characters talk about their love of lowrider car culture and community.  I purchased the DVD (after catching part of the movie on TV) mainly for the INCREDIBLE soundtrack.  Great marriage of music and imagery here, the producers slam dunked each song selection.  Check it out if you have the chance...if you dig soul music or cars you will probably really like this.",1264291200,,415,5.073529411764706
8200073,4,B000F1IO4S,"Carol Strong's film, with sincerity and without condescension, clearly grasps the somewhat ridiculous nature of the low riding culture of South Central L.A. -- the tricked-out cars that glide so close to the ground they draw sparks; the ornately airbrushed sedans that bounce so high they sometimes crack their springs.

But it also unquestionably understands and conveys the beauty of the automobiles and the people who live for them.

""Sunday Driver"" breaks it all down to elements -- the paint, the rims, the hydraulics, the codes, and the individual pride but also the brotherhood that exists among lowriders.

T-birds and Impalas are lovingly photographed and the stories poignantly told over a perfect soundtrack by the JB's, the Temptations, the Miracles and more.

Perhaps most intriguing aspect of the film is its look into the group's uneasy relationship with the cops, a thread that rises to a particularly wry coda (ending, of all places, in Japan).

There are so many car shows and even car channels that ""Sunday Driver"" on the surface might seem obscure or obsolete, but it's a smart little film that gets in, samples the culture and the stories, then rides off in just under an hour.",1167177600,3,1198,5.0
8200074,5,B000F1IO4S,"This DVD gave an awesome insight into the Compton chapter of the Majestics CC. It has some great footage, a must have DVD for any real lowrider like myself. This is not some truucha style dvd... you get to see clean cars tapping bumper and laying frame. Thats how it should be!",1156464000,,277,4.346153846153846
8200075,5,B000F1IO4S,"These guys really prove the passion behind the lowridin culture. It shows what success can bring with hard work and dedication. I reccomend this video to all lowriders and anybody who may be interested or curious. Lowridin is not just a hobby, it's a way of life. Keep your head up Gangster. You'll be back soon and will build something even better than Santana. -peace",1147132800,3,369,4.6923076923076925
8200076,5,B000F1IO4S,"let me start of by saying I know a few of these brothas PERSONALLY and I belong to a L.A(WATSS,COMPTON) car club as well.

This Documentry was put together well,and with alot of honesty. It shows what we as Lowriders go through with police and streo types,but It also lets you into our world alittle deeper. You can see how we are like family and the lengths we will go to help each other out.

You don't have to be a Lowrider to enjoy this video,If you are a car guy,or even just a everyday guy,Sunday driver is a good pick up and a Great video to own.

Thanks.",1146614400,5,562,4.137614678899083
