7856060,5,6303944698,I loved this video. It is chilling and fascinating. Paranormal shows are one of my weaknesses and I think this is one of the best I've ever seen. The footage and EVPs captured are amazing. I wish this was available on dvd as well.,1271548800,,230,4.25
7856061,5,6303944698,I first saw this when it first came out and still find myself renting it occasionally.  I think it's very scary and very well-done.  Highly recommended.,1218153600,,152,4.8076923076923075
7856062,3,6303944698,"As most people know, this video is a compilation of ghost segments from the ""Sightings"" TV show. (For a brief history of the show, see my review of ""Sightings: The UFO Report"".) The show was excellent, this video is good (but not perfect).

The video covers such topics as ghosts around the world, ""The Entity"" case, EVPs, Gettysburg ghosts, a haunted lighthouse, haunted castles, Alcatraz Island, ""The Heartland Haunting"", etc. The host segments were filmed new for this video. Tim White is in a Victorian-looking house, introducing the segments. As with the other videos, the opening theme and montage is shown (looks like the opening logo from the third season). Also, as with the other videos, there is an advertisement (before the main feature) for the other videos in this series, as well as a video that is unrelated to ""Sightings"".

The presentation is entertaining and of good quality, but it is too brief. The video is approximately 57 minutes long. I would have liked at least two hours, maybe three. Also, without an opening and ending to each segment (as they did on the show), it is all lumped together and seems to speed by faster than the show's episodes did. As with the other videos, the video quality is good for a VHS tape (at least, my copies are).

My main problem is with their use of psychics (or ""mediums""). I've never been a fan of psychics. Even though I do believe in most other paranormal things (such as ghosts), I have always had a hard time believing in psychics. I think most, if not all, of them are phoney. After all, anyone can say they feel a cold spot or hear a ghost talking to them. It doesn't prove that the psychics are genuine. I would have preferred more scientific ghost hunters on all of ""Sightings"" ghost segments (normal people using ghost-hunting equipment). (I think maybe one is featured here.) But mostly they feature psychics such as Peter James (a ""Sightings"" mainstay). This always kind of took the fun away from the ghost segments for me. Also, the video is never really as creepy as it should be, but that's okay. I also think that they should have titled it ""...Ghost Encounters"" instead of ""Ghost Report"", but that's a very small nitpick.

Despite my criticisms, this video is good and definitely worth buying for ""Sightings"" fans and ghost fans. I really wish that Paramount would release ""Sightings"" on DVD (preferably, unedited, as the shows originally aired). But unless that happens, this is the only way to see this show now.",1147392000,3,2490,4.74364896073903
