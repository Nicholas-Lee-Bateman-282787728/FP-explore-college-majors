8015943,5,B0001OGV1C,"although it is animated it worked well with the older children and well as the small ones,  I even enjoyed it, fit right in with my teaching. My first time using a video.
thank you",1396828800,,180,4.142857142857143
8015944,5,B0001OGV1C,"GOOD story from the bible for all ages,don't get caught up in this silly world get back to God's word cause that's the way to lived",1391731200,,131,4.076923076923077
8015945,3,B0001OGV1C,"This video doesn't seem to hold my kids' attention at this time (they're 4 and 3), but may be better suited to them when they get a little older.  The animation is pretty ""old school"", and that may be the problem as well, but I feel that the content, at least what I've seen of it, is good.",1366934400,,290,4.0
8015946,5,B0001OGV1C,"My son (who is 8) has loved this DVD set for years.  He has probably watched it since he was 3 or 4.  We've worn out our DVD set and I am pleased to be able to find a replacement.  Of course the animation is different from cartoons today, but that makes no difference to kids.  My kids still love the old Scooby Doo cartoons and they were from the 60's.  Bottom line - don't hesitate to buy this set.  It is very true to the Bible and provides a way to bring Bible stories to life for little ones.",1274918400,5,497,3.92
8015947,4,B0001OGV1C,"I purchased this DVD based on an amazon.com review.  The illustrations are surprisingly good, the animation is not up to today's standards, though.  On a positive note, there certainly is more truth and less embellishment contained in this than more up-to-date versions of Bible teaching ""movies"" or DVD's.  Your child can certainly learn more Bible truths from this DVD than any other I've seen.  It was produced in 1978 by the American Lutheran Church.  It also contains a lot of material from both the Old and New Testaments on two DVD's.  My daughter likes it - she's 3 years old.  It would probably be more understandable to older children, though.  Be prepared - it is not as exciting as something like Veggie Tales or Prince of Egypt, but there's  more Bible content and the content follows the Bible much more closely.  Certainly, a great value and worth a try.",1173398400,6,869,4.771812080536913
8015948,2,B0001OGV1C,"These video's are rough. I am sorry but I bought this for my 2 year old and I am pretty sure she will not care to even watch them until she is like 8 or 9. They were put out in the late 70's and they do reflect it. I gave them 2 stars ONLY because they seem to stay close to the bible in content. But really don't even waste your 10 bucks. The animation and the dialogue are horribly stiff. There is nothing here to make a child interested in learning about the Bible, maybe one day when she already wants to learn about it but this video collection is certainly not going to instill any desire.",1170201600,3,595,4.008403361344538
8015949,5,B0001OGV1C,"Don't let the budget price on this collection of animated Bible stories fool you: these cartoons offer brilliantly scripted and colorful adaptations of Bible stories from the Old and New Testaments. While the animation is a bit stiff, the dialogue among characters is well-written while staying true to the Bible.

I watched most of these animated featurettes as a child, and I can still re-watch them. The stories are simple enough for a child to understand, yet captivating enough to entertain adults. As a child, I learned a great deal about the Bible through this series. Highly recommended.

The series includes the stories of Joseph, Moses, David, Elijah, Esther, Jeremiah, Jesus (who has several stories in this set), the Apostles, and Paul.",1166227200,9,748,5.122950819672131
