8581408,1,B0025KW1PK,"Are you kidding me. What are you trying to sell. This DVD isn't worth $14.00. Some pretty video with some background music. For the observation tower you show a guy walking up steps and looking out over the canopy. For the daily life you show a guy paddling a canoe on a river. Maybe you should do some talking and be descriptive, just a thought. For someone who has never walked this exact path the viewer would not have a clew where they are or what they are looking for other than watching some one walk down a path. The only interesting thing about this video is the packaging. Your cover says ""Take a relaxing cruise in a dugout canoe surrounded by jungle life"". WHAT??? You have a camera hanging off the side of a canoe looking at the wake in the water while the canoe is paddled about 50 feet down a river. Don't blink the whole DVD isn't 15 minutes long including credits. Bad choice.",1242604800,3,892,4.347305389221557
