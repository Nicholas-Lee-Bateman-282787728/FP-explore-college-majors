8558009,3,B00AUKIF2K,"I am learning that good quality information one needs to know about playing drums will never be completely in one package deal.  This system has a great section on many drum fills on one DVD, starting with the simplest and becoming more complex.  There is more than one camera view, including the feet at work, and this section is very helpful.  However, the instruction for hand technique with the sticks is badly flawed and will lead to carpal tunnel syndrome.  Ignore this instruction and get Tommy Igoe's DVDs Great Hands for  Lifetime, which is the best instruction on hand technique.  There is a lot of material in this system, but not all of it is helpful.  That is why it does not have five stars.  Why is there a trend of individuals presenting information while poorly dressed, not professional looking, which also affects the presentation?",1510617600,,850,4.813793103448276
