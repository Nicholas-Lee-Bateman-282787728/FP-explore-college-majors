8024859,4,B00029RSUO,"GIRL IN TROUBLE(81mins/1963): A young woman runs-away from her boyfriend and hitchhikes, when the driver tries to attack, she kills him and takes the car. From there she enters New Orleans and stays in a sleazy motel where an old fart peeps into her room and sees her washing blood from her clothes. Eventually she gets a job as a clothes modeler and gets sexually assaulted again when she does some personal modeling from a guys hotel room. Its one bad situation after another for this unfortunate young lady.

A GOOD TIME WITH A BAD GIRL(59mins/1967): Susan is a young girl who travels to Las Vegas in order to start a new life. While browsing around at a strip mall, she bumps into a middle-aged businessman. They end up going out about town and the older gentleman springs back to life and feels ""young"" again. They end up in his expensive hotel room and go for a swim in the mini-pool. Eventually they end up at a swingers party(with plenty of scenes of shapely females shaking their boobs and butts). There is some nice footage of old Vegas, way before all the expansion.

BAD GIRLS DO CRY(59mins/1954): Sally is drugged and forced to work at a whorehouse. Tommy 'Mr. Hero' comes to rescue her, but is followed by an old looking hoodlum who chases after Tommy and they both throw some weak looking punches. This movie features some very bad voice-overs and ""whores"" who seem to just dance all the time and make exaggerated facial expressions. There is also very old scenes of Los Angeles.

Along with the main features, there is also a Gallery of 'Exploitation Movie-Mag Covers with Audio Oddities'(9:50) and 'Misty Ayers:Striptease Goddess Short'(6:09). And finally, there are 6 trailers(Bad Girls Go to Hell/Good Time with a Bad Girl/Prowl Girls/The Diary of Knockers McCalla/Bad Girls Don't Cry). All movies are in B&W. My personal favorite flick here is 'A Good Time with a Bad Girl'. I liked the chemistry between the two main actors and the old scenes of Vegas.",1347753600,21,1973,4.746355685131196
8024860,3,B00029RSUO,"I think it is great that old exploitation flicks like these are being preserved. They have documentary value and show how specific sites and moral values change. The three cheaply made movies are of a sordid quality that fits their content to perfection. They show stuffy, claustrophobic interiors and more and less glamorous locations in Las Vegas, New Orleans and Southern California. Violence and nudity are mild compared with what is current standard nowadays. The movies share a female point of view and give (probably without intention) an insight into the conditions of young women before the sexual liberation.",1140393600,22,618,5.252525252525253
