8080803,4,B000AYELQ0,"definitely enjoy this product! It's something that I can easily do everyday, and keep things mixed up with different workouts. Not too long, and just strenuous enough. Being that they are only half an hour, they are easily combinable into hour long workouts, if I'm feeling feisty.",1294531200,3,281,5.0
8080804,5,B000AYELQ0,"I bought this product at Target a few years ago and have used it on and off with success. The Cardio Pilates dvd is my favorite! Ana Caban is great with cuing, she seems friendly and encouraging. I can do almost all the pilates moves on this dvd now and want to find something a little more intense. I would prefer to stay with Giaim because I've been very happy with their products so far.
Anyway, I recommend this if you have no experience with pilates. The intro dvd is great and once you master that I would move onto the powerhouse workout and then onto cardio pilates. You will be sore, but just stretch a lot and be sure not to push yourself beyond what you're able to do. There are moves in the dvds that could cause you to arch your lower back and get hurt, but if you don't push too hard, you should be fine. I love how if you pay attention to your posture when you're walking, your stomach gets flatter because you're ""using your powerhouse"".",1275955200,2,953,4.2707182320441985
8080805,4,B000AYELQ0,"The first to DVD's are VERY easy and short ( under 30 mins for the longer one ) i haven't tried the cardio version yet but it looks a bit better. I never did pilates in my life and i was able to complete all of th exercises in advance form with no problem. As for the shipper, they were wonderful. Package arrived ahead of time... worth the $15 i think. Esp. with the body band which seems sturdy.",1238112000,6,397,4.037974683544304
8080806,2,B000AYELQ0,"I just bought this series wanting to have a home workout option when I couldn't make it to my pilates class.  I've only taken pilates for 3 months now, but I found the powerhouse and easy pilates videos very underchallening.  The easy pilates is for someone who has no experience with pilates and the powerhouse pilates is so easy it's ridiculous.  The cardio pilates video is better but the cardio section is SO REPETITIOUS--definitely NOT a video you could do every day.  You'll get bored within a week.",1237248000,3,505,4.704545454545454
