8385965,2,B0030MLHFW,"Wow ... I can't believe all of the 5 star reviews.  I bought this DVD because of these reviews and am extremely disappointed.  First problem is the sound; what's the point of having a coach if you can't hear him/her over the music?  I had to play the DVD without the coaching as it was annoying and distracting.  My biggest problem with the DVD though is the camera work.  When the camera is showing the cyclists in the DVD from behind with an expansive look at the road and scenery it's great.  That's what I expected.  In this view, visual techniques could be used so I could see the road, experience the scenery and anticipate the terrain.  Unfortunately, it flips around constantly from this view to a very limited front view when you can only view a corner of the road and no scenery so no ability to visualize, to a sideways look at the scenery, to looking at the cyclists front on so they are coming towards the screen as if I'm going backwards.  This image was ridiculous.  It was impossible to feel like I was riding through amazing Italy with the constant camera work shifting around.  The only thing I really liked was the clock counting down but in the end, I just kept watching the time wishing for it to count down faster so the ride could be over.  I bought 2 of these DVDs at a cost of almost $90 after taxes and shipping.  What a waste of money.  I am only giving it 2 stars because the music is decent, and I did get a good workout.  I just didn't enjoy the workout.",1352246400,2,1484,4.287769784172662
8385966,5,B0030MLHFW,"I had a single CD, but finally found the rest of the set.  Love this for am rides when winter is up us.  Sound could be a bit louder, but love this as a break from other spnnerval training videos.",1325030400,,196,3.875
8385967,5,B0030MLHFW,"The Urban Assault video by the Global Ride gang is my favorite indoor workout.  The two 20-minute power segments are an ideal for both power training and for ""strendurance"" heart rate training.  The quality of the video is excellent, the music soundtrack is energetic and engaging, and the scenery draws you into your workout so completely that you stop watching the clock.  Running on a treadmill for more than 20 minute can be exceedingly boring, but this video (and the two others in the Italy series) makes the whole hour pass unbelievably quickly.  The Global Ride videos have made winter training much more engaging (and sustainable) than I would ever have thought possible.",1310601600,,680,4.991150442477876
8385968,5,B0030MLHFW,Video is great.  Music is excellent.  I have totally enjoyed the Global Ride Italy series.  They made the winter days on the trainer much more enjoyable.  The Hawaii series is also really good.  I recieved my copy of the France series today and I almost wish it was winter.  Best videos to watch while training ever!!  If you can't ride outside this is the next best thing.,1310169600,,373,4.477611940298507
8385969,5,B0030MLHFW,"I bought this for a friend as a ""hostess gift/thank you"".  She hadn't ever done indoor training to scenic rides like this, and she loved it!
Sweating buckets, I think was her reply!",1296345600,,181,4.484848484848484
8385970,5,B0030MLHFW,"Yes, it can be quite boring to train indoor during the snowy, wintry weather but GlobalRide makes an hour go by quite quickly, and with a challenge.

Their Speed and Power in Italy has been a part of my cycling DVDs collection for a while now; today I broke in their new production, Urban Assault in Italy.  I loved it just as much!

The options of coaches on/off, different languages, class or open road format, and music on/off offer needed variety; the digital display of time left is helpful; the scenery is lovely; and the bonus track (this time - ball training) is a valuable added bonus. The 'pros' can put their power meter to work alright.

Suggestions for future productions: a gradient display of the terrain? A view of the class when using that option, even if as lesser portion of a split screen?

Buy it, use it -- your body and spirit will feel great!",1261699200,3,866,4.490445859872612
