3145458,5,B0015LPRQU,This film is fantastic. Telling the stories of these artists and how balloons improved their lives really moved me. But the balloons are amazing!! These balloon people have so much fun creating the most unique sculptures anyone has ever seen. The movie does a wonderful job intertwining the artist's stories with the balloon conventions. I own the DVD and have watched it several times already!,1229644800,7,394,5.076923076923077
3145459,5,B0015LPRQU,"This is a fantastic movie. The visuals alone would be worth watching- an enormous balloon octopus flies over a city manned by a pilot rigged to helium balloons is just one breathtaking example- but the stories of the balloon twisters profiled really make this a joy to watch. I've already pre-ordered my copy of the DVD, and can't wait until it arrives so I can show it to all of my friends that couldn't make it this weekend.",1211846400,9,426,4.4743589743589745

8258922,5,B0015LPRQU,"I came across this on the Daily Show's website, in their staff's extracurricular activities section.
Me:  Hey, I like balloon animals.  What a neat skill.
Twisted:  Look, you can make balloon animals too!  Check out the stories behind how all these people became balloon artists.

I totally went out and got a balloon art kit because of this movie.  And I was able to make the balloon dog on my first try.  Thank you, Twisted, for encouraging me to learn more about (and try) my newest hobby.

And also?  This documentary shows that there are some crazy ambitious and competitive types, but you get that with ANYTHING, and a lot of people who become balloon artists have some really amazing stories about why.  Somebody points out at the convention they attend that it's one of the only businesses where people are happy to share their ""secret"" techniques and creations.  What a fantastic group of people!",1316908800,2,905,4.774193548387097
8258923,5,B0015LPRQU,This is a great documentary. You get to immerse yourself in this quirky and super interesting subculture. The stories are both funny and touching. I watched the movie a while ago and I still remember a lot of the stories. Must watch.,1295654400,2,233,4.571428571428571

8258925,5,B0015LPRQU,"Who knew that there was such a culture built around balloon animals?  This movie made me laugh, made me think, and moved me at different times.  Definitely worth seeing!",1243296000,6,169,4.793103448275862
8258926,5,B0015LPRQU,"A friend pointed me to this movie since he knew I liked twisting balloons.  Usually when I watch TV or a movie, I'm usually doing something else like web surfing or checking my email.  This documentary totally engrossed me.  Maybe it was because I have met over half of the featured twisters at conventions before, and knew some of their stories.  ""Twisted"" is an emotional rollercoaster.  I literally went from laughing to sobbing to feeling real pride in humanity during the course of this movie.

If you're a balloon twister, SEE THIS FILM.  If you're not, see it anyway - it's a fascinating look into a world of strange and fascinating people.",1232496000,5,647,4.723214285714286
8258927,5,B0015LPRQU,"I saw Twisted: a Balloonamentary at the theater, and I loved it so much I decided to buy the DVD.  If you loved the spelling bee movie Spellbound, you'll love Twisted.  The two movies are similar in that the filmmakers travel the country focusing on eight people.  The characters in Twisted: a Balloonamentary go to the same annual balloon convention titled Twist and Shout, where the filmmakers get some great shoots of extraordinary balloon sculptures.  The balloon artist who I think has the most interesting story, Vera, uses her balloon-twisting job to move from her trailer park to medical school, and another balloon artist tells bible stories with balloons.  The movie shows people who make money doing what they love: making balloon animals at parties, restaurants, etc.  However, the character who makes the most money does little balloon twisting and instead has artists working for her.  It's a feel good movie with laugh out loud moments.",1229731200,3,951,5.0576923076923075
