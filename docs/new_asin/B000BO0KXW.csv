8089690,5,B000BO0KXW,"Serious, robotic, intelligent, with a smokin' cartoon cyborg chick. I'm bored of fantasy anime, I want more science fiction! If you are not on the GitS bandwagon yet, you are dumb.",1268697600,,180,4.838709677419355
8089691,4,B000BO0KXW,"I liked this series, but in my opinion, the puppeteer hacker character is not quite as good as ths laughing man storyline of original Stand Alone Complex, and the message is not quite as profound.  This still has great animation, but just didn't hold my interest like the other SAC's did.  I still favor the original movie best of all.",1237161600,,335,4.566666666666666

8089694,5,B000BO0KXW,"Wow this volume of the second gig series is sweet. There is a ton of action in all the episodes and the CG sequences are better than ever. Furthermore, you also finally get clued-in on the majors past and who Goda is.

The sound/music of this dvd is amazing. In these 4 episodes, more so than the last 8, the producers have heavily mixed in some of the best and mostly unheard of, GITS OST music scores- over the action and over the dialogue, making each episode have more of a movie like flow.

Also what's even more impressive is that for the first time, in a long while, you actually get to see a fully CG animated ghost dive.

Now as for the Tachikoma's, they are in full force in this DVD, however, there jobs are a bit different than usual, they get to help the Section 9 crew ghost dive!, yea and there humor is also intact in this volume as well.

As I said before, very impressive for a continuation of the series, definitely a must see",1138147200,6,945,4.233333333333333
