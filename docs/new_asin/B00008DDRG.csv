7981478,3,B00008DDRG,"As a lifelong fan of the U.S. space program, and someone quite knowledgeable about the Soviet Union's extraordinary accomplishments in space (first Earth satellite, first man in space, first woman in space, first manned orbit, first satellite to reach the moon, first spacewalk, first unmanned lunar landing, etc.), I was rather disappointed that this film was subtitled ""The true story of the Russian Race for Space"". In fact, it wasn't much of a story at all, but rather the reminisces of a handful of cosmonauts (and some of their wives), regarding the early Soviet manned space program (presented more or less chronologically). Someday I hope there will be a more comprehensive story that makes the American public more aware of the Soviet Union's breadth of accomplishments in space, even if ""first man on the moon"" was not one of them.",1484265600,,841,5.014285714285714

7981480,4,B00008DDRG,"For anyone interested in the early Soviet manned space program or in space flight in general, this DVD is a ""must-have.""  This is probably one of the few films about the Soviet manned space program which is available on DVD.

The DVD is a compilation of interviews with cosmonauts (and some of their spouses) from the earliest years of the Soviet manned space program, combined with archival footage to illustrate the early space missions.

The interviews with the cosmonauts are very interesting.  The cosmonauts provide first-hand accounts of the early Soviet manned space missions.  The video provides the viewer with an account of the bravery of the early cosmonauts as well as the recklessness of the people involved in the decision-making behind some of those early missions.

The DVD does have a few downsides.  The DVD is limited to interviews and archival footage.  There is next to no narration to provide the viewer with information obtained from research of documentation of the early Soviet missions.  The documentary is not comprehensive.  While the DVD does provide information on the highlights of the early Soviet manned space program, it does not include every mission.  For example, the Vostok flight of Valentina Tereshkova (the first woman in space) was not included in this film.  The information on the early Soyuz missions was limited to the Soyuz 1 and Soyuz 11 missions, both of which ended in tragedy.

Overall, the DVD is definitely worth having.  Anyone interested in Soviet manned space flight or in space exploration in general will find ""The Red Stuff"" riveting.  It is a very fascinating look at the early Soviet manned space missions.  Still, ""The Red Stuff"" does not include information on every mission; and, this certainly presents future film makers with an opportunity to do a more thoroughly-researched documentary on the Soviet manned space program.

Included on the DVD is a second documentary called ""Starman,"" a documentary on the life of Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space.  Either ""The Red Stuff"" or ""Starman"" alone would have been worth the price of the DVD; but, getting both films on one DVD makes this DVD a bargain.  I am very glad to have added this DVD to my collection.",1395878400,3,2225,4.981029810298103
7981481,5,B00008DDRG,"A very well done DVD about the Russian space program and their cosmonauts told by the people who were part of it. There are plenty of real footage used and includes interviews with many of the 20 cosmonauts who were chosen for the first flight. Russian language with English subtitles. The DVD includes a 50 minute documentary on Yuri Gagarin featuring members of his family, fellow cosmonauts and friends. All in Russian with a voice over in English. Well worth it.",1354752000,,466,4.765432098765432
7981482,4,B00008DDRG,"With this a gently paced documentary, the other reviews were mixed, but decided to watch anyway, and I'm very glad I did.

While yes if you are already an experienced space buff you may not learn anything new, the information is accurate, and the only spoken parts are from the various cosmonauts of the ""first 20"" to be selected. This is poignant watching as several of the cosmonauts interviewed have since passed away in the early 2000s.

I found the recollections of the amiable and talented Leonov, the first artist in space, the most insightful. A poem of his is also recited.

The film has a very slow, dreamlike pace, with lots of continous shots (one in-car shot, through a cracked windshield is very effective) and footage from training, propaganda films, and other instances such as rescue crews desperately trying to revive the crew of Salyut 1.

An earlier reviewer mentioned the lack of Valentina Tereshkova: this is true, but the documentary is centered on the ""first 20"" selected cosmonauts and their experiences and adventures.

I recommend reading&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-First-Soviet-Cosmonaut-Team-Their-Lives-and-Legacies-Springer-Praxis-Books-Space-Exploration/dp/0387848231/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The First Soviet Cosmonaut Team: Their Lives and Legacies (Springer Praxis Books / Space Exploration)</a>&nbsp;before watching this, as you will get a lot more enjoyment and understanding from the film.

Very little background information is given and there is pretty much no introduction. The viewer already needs some background knowledge of the ""Space Race"" to fully enjoy.

7981483,4,B00008DDRG,"Red Stuff: The True Story of the Russian Race for Space (DVD) was a four star DVD production as far as this reviewer was concerned.  Contains lots of footage we always wanted to see but never could because of the tight lid the old Soviet Union maintained on their space program.  Also features interviews with many of the first crop of 21 cosmonauts. The value of Sergei Korolev to the Soviet space effort is told on a first hand basis from the mouths of the cosmonauts.

Some black and white and lots of color footage all in original Russian with english subtitles.  Overall, if you are an aerospace historian wanna be, you will enjoy this DVD.  Also included is a biographical film on the life and death of Yuri Gagarin.  Running time 100 minutes and video quality not too bad considering the age of the material.",1241654400,,815,4.5479452054794525
7981484,3,B00008DDRG,"It's refreshing to see a documentary about the Soviet space program! Yet it turned out to be somewhat of a disappointment. It has a substantial array of interviews with surviving cosmonauts, plus others who were involved in the program. But the documentary has almost no narration; it seems to be trying to rely on the interviews to do the narration for it, which often didn't work. My wife said she would have been lost if I hadn't kept filling her in as we went along.

The DVD has a bonus film, Starman, about the life and career of Yuri Gagarin. If you watch The Red Stuff and are disappointed, don't skip Starman thinking it'll be more of the same. It's well-narrated and well-explained, and well worth watching. Starman was really what The Red Stuff should have been.",1240272000,4,773,4.642335766423358
7981485,1,B00008DDRG,"I was quite looking forward to this material (VHS)expecting some consolidated story of the early soviet manned programms. Date of release -2003- evoked the hope of seeing rare footages because the story is quite well known - not only never secret propaganda films from triumphal welcome of cosmonauts by top rank party leaders. I am heavily disapointed. The ""story"" is a compilation of several inteviews with first soviet cosmonauts revealing nothing new, not even K.Feoktistov's dislike of Comunist Party and G.Titov's not being happy not getting the first Vostok seat. The footages used are not always related to Vostok, using Soyuz footage when speaking of Vostok is really for beginners only. Author's added commentary on last moments of V.Komarov (screaming, accusing ...) is based on fairy tale, interestingly, here he did not bother to ask the interviewed cosmonauts.

The bonus part of the tape, The Starman, the life story of Y.Gagarin, is at least a content story using original footages from Vostok programm. On the other hand, majority of interviewed people remained nameless, you see somebody speak but you do not know who it is.

If you want to know the true story of the soviet early manned space program read better some books, you find a lot of excellent ones in Amazon. This compilation is far from it ...",1109116800,28,1323,5.009090909090909
7981486,4,B00008DDRG,"Interestly the DVD surprised me with the ommission of Valentina Vladimirovna Tereshkova the first women in space there was no mention of her except in passing WHY?,it would been nice to see the film footage of her in training and in space,to add a further insult they mentioned the first dog in space with film footage but not her???.Other that that this DVD has put a piece of puzzle together about the Russian Space program that was hidden from the west and also the Russian public.,I would have like to see more interviews with some of the other Cosmonauts and find out what happened to some of the one's that washed out of the program .The interviews are candid and they talk about some of the problem with the program .The added bonus is a documentary about Yuri Gargain that is worth the price of this DVD..I give 4 stars because of the ommision of Valentina Vladimirovna Tereshkova. I hope the producers go back and update this DVD.",1077494400,14,939,4.595238095238095

La biografa sobre Yuri Gagarin en este DVD es la ms completa que se haya visto alguna vez en televisin.
