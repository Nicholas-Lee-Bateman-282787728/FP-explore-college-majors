8556448,4,B00AQL7PRY,"Gottfried Helnwein is a provocative and compelling contemporary visual artist whose obsession  at least in art  is children. What makes his work somewhat disturbing is that he is committed to showing the innocence that children embody as compromised again and again. Watching Helnwein working on what could be described as the ultimate application of his obsession  the production design for the opera The Child Dreams in Tel Aviv in 2009/2010  the viewer must decide if he/she is being drawn into the workings of genuine creative genius or witnessing an exercise in pretentiousness and bad taste. It depends on ones perspective. While I would classify my reaction as the former, I felt moments of distinct unease watching the birth of this opera. The experience does beg the question, when does the use of children in art  especially art of a provocative nature  become exploitation?

Despite my own moments of initial uncertainty, the power of Helnweins vision came into sharp focus when the tableau effect of countless children suspended in the sky was revealed on the operas stage. Even Helnwein himself is taken aback when he first sees his vision realized. Witnessing this epiphany suggests the film mightve benefited if it were packaged on DVD with the complete opera production as an extra feature.

This, really, is the ultimate compliment I can give the film: that it is somehow incomplete without the opera. Left wanting more of the story but not more of the film (if that makes sense), Im inclined to overlook Helnweins personal quirks (his perpetual dressing in black, ever-present Ray Orbisonesque sunglasses and a bandana a la Danny The Count Koker, for example) as being genuine if eccentric expressions of a unique artist. How this contrasts with the similarly clad but utterly pretentious choreographer of the opera is an eye-roller. The latter looks like hes trying to compensate for his natural average-ness by dressing up like the cool kid. Standing next to the very genuine Helnwein, he looks like a poser, or at least a strange Goth/Nerd hybrid.

GOTTFRIED HELNWEIN AND THE DREAMING CHILDREN is not for everyone, but for those who appreciate artists who push the boundaries in the search for genuine meaning and revelation (of the kind only Art can provoke), this is a fascinating creative journey.

END SLATE: Looking at Helnweins resume, he once designed a stage production of Shakespeares Macbeth. Now THAT I wouldve loved to have seen!",1397433600,3,2462,5.086848635235732
