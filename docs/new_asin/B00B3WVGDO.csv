5554545,5,B00B3WVGDO,Love the music and the workout! The best dance workout DVD I've purchased and that includes the Zumba DVD's. I cannot wait for Christi's next Pure SPICE dance workout!,1366848000,,167,4.793103448275862
5554546,5,B00B3WVGDO,"Love, love, love this workout.  I love the dance workouts the best and this is better than the Zumba where the steps really go to the music.  You can really tell this has been thought out.  This is my first Christi video and I really hope there are more of these to come.  My heart rate monitor shows over 900 calories burned the first workout I did and I can't wait to see how many more I can burn the more use to the steps I get.  Thank you Christi.....",1366156800,2,455,4.011111111111111
5554547,5,B00B3WVGDO,"This workout is similar to Zumba, but with more variety in music.  I've been doing Zumba for about a year and found Christi's program very refreshing and easy to learn.  It features different dance styles -- salsa, American hip hop, samba, etc. at a pace guaranteed to get your heart rate up and have you burning plenty of calories.  Christi uses no verbal cueing, everything is done with hand signals (points left, move to the left) and is easy to follow as you are mirroring her and her group of exercisers.  There is a section called ""move master"" which breaks down the moves and gets you familiar with the coreography. 11 songs in all, the first is a dance style warm-up, then nine mixed impact songs, followed by a cool-down and stretch.",1359849600,8,742,4.598484848484849
5554552,5,B00B3WVGDO,"I'm no dancer, and I just can't move my feet as fast as they do in this workout, but I love it anyhow.

I just move my feet at whatever tempo I can actually manage, and just keep moving to the music whether or not I manage to get the steps correct.

The time flies by. Wish I could take the music for this one with me on my mp3 player, it'd be great for walking.

I'm looking forward to the sequel, hope the music is as fabulous.",1401926400,,429,3.852272727272727
5554553,5,B00B3WVGDO,"What a fun dance video!  I really enjoy the versatile dances: salsa, hip-hop, disco, Caribbean, and belly dancing. I worked up a sweat by the end of the video.",1395619200,,159,4.482758620689655
5554554,5,B00B3WVGDO,"Even without the verbal cueing, this is a very easy to follow workout.  The hand cueing works fine.  Each of the 11 segments, are 5 minutes in length.  At first I thought the ""breaks"" between segments would slow me down but I find myself using the brief ""break"" to catch my breath.  The workout segments are fairly easy to follow and I am totally uncoordinated.  Since it's a dvd you can redo a segment, rewind or even use the move master section if you are having trouble getting the steps down.  I just did a segment a few times, at first without my arms/hands, till I got the steps down.  You don't need much room do to this workout.  I don't have that much of an area to workout, ~9' x ~6', but it is fine for this workout.  I am a big Christi Taylor workout fan and I would highly recommend you purchase this dvd to add to your workout collection.",1382486400,,852,4.209876543209877
5554555,5,B00B3WVGDO,"This video is definitely dance-y, so if you don't want to or like to dance, don't get this video.  Although I don't think of myself as a dancer, I really enjoy this video.  An entire section is devoted to teaching the moves (""Move Master"") of each song, and I found it helpful to watch a few of the Move Master chapters to get the gist of the dance, then get right into the workout.  I found the style of this workout similar to ""Zumba"" with it's heavy Latin beat and moves.  Time flies when I do this workout!",1381708800,,510,4.173469387755102
5554556,5,B00B3WVGDO,This  workout DVD is my favorite of the year! I have several DVD' s from Christi and all are top-notch but this one is outstanding! So much thought and work went into this production and it shows. I love love love her music selections and choreographing. Her style and personality are so genuine you will love working out with this DVD:),1379894400,,337,4.524590163934426
5554557,5,B00B3WVGDO,"Super fun! Puts me in a great mood and makes me sweat! Really fantastic workout.
The choreography is about a medium to advanced level.",1377561600,,134,4.625
5554558,5,B00B3WVGDO,"You drive to your local gym to attend a Zumba class.  Your normal instructor is absent and in her place is a perky auburn hair substitute instructor named Christi.  For the next 55 minutes you have the best most fun class you have ever attended.  THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THIS DVD IS LIKE.  The only difference between this and a real class is the fact that in a class the institutor is usually on a stage platform by herself/himself and everyone in the class is facing the instructor.  On the dvd Christi is on the floor with the class and everyone is facing the camera.  The idea of this placement is to allow you to see the different ""spice"" or modifications the individuals in the class bring to the steps plus make you feel like you are in a real class.  The problem is sometimes it is little hard to focus on Christi due to the enthusiasm of some of the ladies but it would less fun if it was just her.

The steps are easy to follow but not so easy to get boring after several viewings.  If you have taken Zumba or done one of the licensed Zumbs dvds or video games then you will be familiar with many of the steps like Samba, Cumbia and Reggaeton.  She also adds in hip-hop, belly dancing, bollywood and every one's favorite DISCO.  The music is great and lots of fun.  Christi's choreography is spot-on in that it is not too simple and not too hard.  She puts in just enough steps in each song to make it interesting but few enough that you can really learn them by doing them multiple times.  There is a reason that most live dance/fitness classes have nonverbal cueing because it really is just as helpful as the verbal especially since the focus is on learning through repetition not learning through listening.

Again, in summary is you take live classes you will love this.  If you have done Zumba, Shaun T's Hip Hop Abs or other dance videos and want to move to next level of 55 minutes or pure cardio - - this DVD is your new best friend.",1377129600,,1949,4.298630136986302
5554559,5,B00B3WVGDO,If you love to dance this dvd is for you!  I'm not very coordinated but this dvd is so much fun & energizing!  I'm sure the more I do it the better I will get.  And you get to learn a bunch of different cultural dance moves!  I also like the fact that there is no verbal cues so I can just concentrate on watching Christi.  I highly recommend this dvd!,1371600000,,352,3.9014084507042255
5554560,5,B00B3WVGDO,"This is my favorite workout video. I really like that she doesn't talk, yet she used her hands to cue so effectively that I caught on as easily as I would have with a talking instructor. Great music, fun dance moves - worked up a sweat but didn't feel like I was hurting my knees. The instructor is really amazing.",1369094400,,314,4.25
5554561,3,B00B3WVGDO,My favorite of hers is FIT TO DANCE I love it ! I have been using it for a few years. This one is just too fast and hard on my knees on carpet. If you love zumba you will love this.,1367020800,,181,3.3333333333333335
8562180,5,B00B3WVGDO,"Love to dance? Then you'll love this workout! I'm not talking about professional dance classes just a dance party. I was skeptical about the lack of verbal cueing but now know that's what makes this workout so great. I've only done this a few times but already have most of the workout down and find this easy to follow. Time flies with this workout, there is a lot of variety to keep me interested and moving onto the next song. The only Negative: there is no option to return to DVD menu once you start the workout or move master. I wanted to learn a couple segments at a time then try them out. I had to completely eject the disc and start over. However, I learned that you could forward through the segments to get to the main menu quicker.
Overall that is a minor irritation while learning. Love this and would love to see more!",1483833600,,833,4.312101910828026
8562181,1,B00B3WVGDO,"I didn't like the format on this DVD. I was very disappointed with this. The instructional demonstrations are not at the beginning of each dance segment. The demonstrations are placed in a section which you select upon turning on the DVD. However if I want to rewatch the demonstration for a specific dance section, I need to restart the DVD & find the section. For some reason the DVD does not return to the main menu. This is not user friendly at all. The entire DVD is done without voice cueing. You only hear the music & the instructor points to different directions. I loved Christi's ""Fit to Dance"" workout & thought  I would like this one just as much. But I didn't like this one at all.  :(",1469232000,,698,4.403100775193798
8562182,5,B00B3WVGDO,"Anything Christi Taylor does is great. As one of her ""followers"" for a couple of decades, she never disappoints. Her cueing is flawless. She may possibly have raised it to an art form, actually.  This video is clever, easy to follow, probably even for beginners. No verbal cues, hand cueing only, a relatively new idea I just love. She gives just enough advanced hand cues to get you set up for the next move. Like the music and sassiness. She is THE best.",1457913600,,456,4.493975903614458
8562183,5,B00B3WVGDO,"Christi Taylor is amazing, what a talented instructor! I feel blessed to have discovered her videos. The music on this one is great, the moves are doable yet challenging and it's so much fun, time just flies by. Great job Christi, thank you!!",1444867200,,242,4.651162790697675
8562184,2,B00B3WVGDO,"For those used to her usual workout, this is way too low impact. I like that she tried to very it but honestly because I'm used to her fantastic for workouts, this one was super boring.",1438214400,,185,4.166666666666667
8562185,3,B00B3WVGDO,"Wanting to try something new, I finally broke down and bought Christi Taylor's Pure Spice: Cinnamon DVD. It was great at first and I loved trying the different dance styles in the workout. I soon realized, though, that a cueless workout video did not work for me. I actually missed being told what came next in the workout and longed for verbal modifications to tricky dance moves--features that were missing in this kind of workout.
So, on long days when I just wanted to dance and not think too much about what came next, I did not reach for Taylor's Pure Spice: Cinnamon DVD. Without the verbal cues, it just required more guesswork and patience than I had to spare!

In short, Christi Taylor's Pure Spice: Cinnamon DVD is perfect for someone who easily learns new things by watching  or doing them (or someone who has the time and the patience to repeatedly watch the DVD's ""Move Master"" to get the steps right). People with auditory learning preferences, though, may have a harder time getting into or sticking with this DVD.",1436832000,,1030,4.685082872928176
8562186,5,B00B3WVGDO,"I WASN'T QUITE SURE WHAT TO EXPECT FROM THIS WORKOUT. WELL, I'M TOTALLY ENJOYING IT & I'M THRILLED WITH THE CHOREOGRAPHY & THE WHOLE FORMAT.",1436745600,,140,4.64
8562187,5,B00B3WVGDO,"I do a lot of step workouts (as well as floor/dance/other cardio) and have just started getting into Christi, so when I saw this video and the great reviews I knew I had to try it.  I just did it for the first time and I LOVE it!  I've done lots of really great Zumba live classes and this has all the best things about many of them.  I was joking to myself as I was doing it that all it's missing is the hooting and hollering between songs (which I kind of wish were in there!).  Just like a live class you will just flail around for a while until you get the moves but it's still super-fun even when I'm not getting the steps.  This is going into the weekly rotation, an instant favorite!

Home workout pro-tip: Put on trouser socks OVER your sneakers to do a workout like this on carpet.  It really works!

Ps. As others have said, don't be turned off by the bible quote (what the..?), there's nothing more like that in the video at all.",1428710400,,940,4.126373626373627
8562188,5,B00B3WVGDO,so fun!  I love Christi Taylor!,1424390400,,31,4.166666666666667
8562189,3,B00B3WVGDO,"There is nothing wrong with this workout, Its just not my preference. I love her step workouts much better . I don't have to look at the TV like i do with this one. I knew I might not like it but it looked fun and eventually I will use it here and there.",1421884800,,254,3.7222222222222223
