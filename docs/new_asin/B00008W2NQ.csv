7987266,5,B00008W2NQ,"but I love this show all the same!  The second disc (episodes 5-8) picks up right where the 1st disc left off. The series itself seems to be an interesting mix of ""yeah, I've been there, done that"" and ""sure, like that would EVER happen!""  Things such as the name of the F4 (would 4 big-shot guys who formed a group merely to bully others REALLY name themselves after flowers?), Tsukasa's interest in Tsukushi (it's a nice thought, but I doubt that some one as high society and conceited as Tsukasa would ever give some one like Tsukushi a second glance, let along spend great amounts of time terrorizing her and even following her to Atami for vacation!), and Rui's behavior in general.  And the series does tend to fall into a pool of melodrama from time to time.  Regardless, I find this series highly entertaining, and very addicting.  I can't wait to see if Tsukushi ends up with Rui or Tsukasa, or neither!",1083628800,5,912,4.536585365853658
