7808592,1,6300261263,"This ""movie"" is a disaster unequivocally not worth your time! The title and write-up were intriguing but very misleading. The quality of the filming, writing, and acting were the equivalent of a very poorly done high school freshman project. Definitely skip this one and move on to another choice!",1412812800,2,297,5.081632653061225

7808595,4,6300261263,"Shelly Winters, Paul Sorvino, Theodore Bikel and Farley Granger star in Very Close Quarters, a zany comedy that laughts at a person's right to privacy as thirty unpredicable pople share quite a ""cozy"" kiving arrangement.
In the heart of Moscow, communal flats are a common way to live. In fact, it's the only way you can live - you have no choice! Privacy is just something to dream about in these surroundings. The tenants share one kitchen, one telephone and a singl bathroom. They share everyting - songs, meals, gossip, lovers. The chaos is as endless as the kilarity when a person's best-kept secrets spread faster than fildfire.",1038528000,3,634,4.87962962962963
