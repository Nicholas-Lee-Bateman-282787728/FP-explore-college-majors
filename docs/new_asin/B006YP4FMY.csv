5037283,1,B006YP4FMY,"I saw this dvd in an Indian store but decided not buy it at the time, the shop keeper was charging $20 for it which isn't bad but I wasn't sure. Found it on here for a cheaper price and decided to order it. Well this copy is fake. I saw the real copy in the Indian store, which had a cardboard type case and had the Reliance proof of authenticity sticker. This dvd came in a plastic case with an entirely different picture on the cover.",1349568000,3,436,4.022988505747127

5037285,2,B006YP4FMY,"Another recent attempt by Bollywood to copy Western action crime thrillers. Same, misdirection plot lines, where people unrealistically think and plan for all the most unlikely outcomes like they have some omniscient insight into the future (more remarkable when it also includes human decision making). Movie copy of decades old car chase scenes, shoot outs, double crosses, crime capers that have been far surpassed in recent cinema. Example: The French, the masters of car chase scenes, would laugh at those scenes in this movie.

Bollywood - either film expand on your rich diverse culture or encourage imaginative/creative thinking in your educational systems.",1337990400,,665,5.519607843137255
5037286,5,B006YP4FMY,"I loved ""Don: The Chase Begins"", which was released in 2006. And I looked forward a lot to seeing ""Don 2"". I was so excited when the DVD arrived in the mail. I love this film!!! I am amazed at how talented Shah Rukh Khan is in the characters he plays in different films. He is truly the coolest bad guy ever in this film!! I loved the action, moments that were romantic, thrills, surprises, cinematography, music, and storyline. This film is the best!!!",1335312000,2,453,4.404761904761905
5037287,4,B006YP4FMY,"My rating is for the movie itself, not for this purchased DVD!!

I bought this DVD through Amazon, from their affiliated store Bollywood Bay, because it was the only one who seemed to have the title in stock. Received the DVD today, sat down to watch it. The video is very mediocre quality, audio's just OK. I'd seen the movie in the theaters, so I knew the quality should be very high.

But the thing that proved that it's a pirated version, not the official release, is this: In the English subtitles at 2 different points, the subtitle reads ""Team xDM - Ripper"" Note that this text had nothing to do with the scene then playing, and didn't fit in at all. The 2 instances were almost an hour apart. This is obviously the hidden signature of the thief who ripped the video from an unreleased preview copy of the movie. Another clue: the official release is 2 disks, with several extra features such as making, song videos, etc. on the 2nd disk. This was just one single layer DVD (3.19 GB) with just the movie, nothing else. It just screams 'PIRATE' !!!

So if you consider buying this movie in the future, make sure you get a legal authentic non-pirated copy.... and then enjoy the movie! (And stay far far away from BOLLYWOOD BAY.)",1331769600,27,1234,4.475555555555555
5037288,2,B006YP4FMY,"This is quite a terrible film that seems to be running on Auto-Pilot mode. There are several attempts at shooting slick, at don showing just how ruthless and intelligent he is but honestly none of that acting really wore off well. The characters become insincere and boring minutes into their introduction. The first Don in the series was a decent effort and I was sure the plot would be interesting. The direction is particularly lacking and it seems that the film is somehow rigmaroled to the audience. I couldn't help but gnaw at the cheek of the film-maker to bring this film out. It was just really terrible and SRK was quite average really. The only scenes in the film I enjoyed were him trying to calm Priyanka down now and then. Otherwise there is nothing remotely appealing about this colossal failure, take my word. Avoid at any cost. I wouldn't watch this if it was playing on the airplane during a long distance flight. It's just terrible and I can't believe my favourite person in the industry, Farhan Akhtar, has finally disappointed me.

I am also a SRK fan but I wait for him to wake up and smell the coffee. Not since Rab Ne...have I seen a decent performance by the man touted as King Khan. Anyway, you still wanna watch it? Go ahead. I hope you love it.",1331424000,4,1272,4.5064935064935066
5037289,4,B006YP4FMY,"Don 2is a sequel to the 2006 film, which itself was a remake of the 1978 Amitabh film. The plot in this film picks up 5 years after  the earlier Don ended. SRK wants to dominate the European underworld, to set his plan in to motion he must seek the assistance of his arch enemy  Vardhan ( Boman Irani), but Vardhan is in prison. So SRK gets himself arrested and lands up in jail to get him out and set his plan in motion. The plan: steal the money printing plates of the German Central Bank. Don 2 has several things in it favor, a witty script laced with Donisms, one liners which are already a rage. An example  Mallik: Tumhari talaash toh duniya ki har police ko hai... kiss kiss se baat karu? Don: Aaj yeh sunkar meri maa kitni khush hoti. Mallik: Apne hathon se hi tumhe goli maar deti. Don: Mr Mallik, aap meri maa ko nahi jaante the. The engaging script has several moments which keep you hooked, such as above, great script, the locations, acting, cinematography and did not let up during the entirety of the 2.30 run time. I personally thought that the following scenes were superb:
Jail Break in Malaysia
Hrithik Roshan's cameo
The car chase in Berlin
The fight scenes
The plot to steal
The final minutes of the film
SRK has completely transformed his body and has a physical presence that suits this role, he  is buff and intense in the physically demanding scenes. After 20 years on the scene, not many actors can entertain and keep you interested like SRK does. Priyanka Chopra looks pretty but somehow lacks the physical presence that is required of the character. As is, the film does not have a lot of things for her to do. Kuanl Kapoor and Lara Dutta are perfect in their mini roles.
Hrithik Roshan is funny.......Jawwab Shah ( Jabbar ) has a towering presence bit is dwarfed by the leads.
The weakest link of the film was the music, the 1978 had some of the best loved music which is popular even today. The music of the 2006 remake managed to impress as well. This soundtrack is a utter and complete disappointment, how on earth did Shankar - Ehsaan-Loy manage such a below average soundtrack. Shame on Farhan Akhtar........
Besides SRK, the cinematography of Jason West raises the bar to make the film come alive.....
I highly recommend this film and enjoyed it . I enjoyed the 2D version, the film was shot in it as well and do not see the point of watching it again in 3D. Please notice the final frames of the film as the stage is set for Don 3 ( hint, notice the number plate of Don's bike)
SRK reaffirms my faith in him again, his past few film have not been up to the mark for me. DON 2 should easily make him the king of the block once again. 4 stars. 12/23/2011",1327536000,24,2689,4.36127744510978

5037298,5,B006YP4FMY,"I initially did not want to watch the first Don because I love SRK and did not want to see him as a wretched, evil, bad guy. LOL! But it was a thrill from beginning to the surprising and unexpected twist at the end! I knew as soon as I saw part 2, I HAD to see this one! Started a bit slow but took off after that and I loved every minute of it! Man, he is a seriously bad, bad, man but at times, you almost feel a bit sorry for whatever turned him that way--but not for long! He has glimpses of humanity but you quickly forget it after some of the things he does. But you can't help but admire the way he skillfully and artfully tricks people and slickly gets away with it. I cannot WAIT for Don 3 next year!!",1416182400,,710,3.8698630136986303

5037304,5,B006YP4FMY,"This sequel maybe even better than the first Don movie. My 10 year old nephew loved it and wants to see Don 3, if it was made. He says even though Don is a bad guy he doesn't want him to get caught or die. Shah Rukh plays the character so cool it's hard to hate him. He is So bad and sexy at same time.

5037305,4,B006YP4FMY,"What I like about SRK is his energy and his passion, and he really puts these into his characterization of Don. I don't like the way he changes into a Mission Impossible- type project manager half-way through, but when he projects criminality with passion, I love it!

Would like to have heard some new music, too. Gotta love the old music, of course, but why not add something new for us to love as well? Why not create a new classic or two?",1371945600,,442,4.325301204819277
5037306,5,B006YP4FMY,Definite buy but make sure you buy the prequel - Don - too (not directly carried by amazon the last time i checked); it will make so much more sense then. Farhan Akhtar did an amazing job and of course SRK was brilliant. PC makes you think she'd be brilliant with the CSI-type series... and of course their chemistry is great as always. Leaves you wondering and imagining what Don 3 should be about... what path it should take. If I could write scripts I'd give this one a shot!!!,1359331200,,480,4.344444444444444

5037309,4,B006YP4FMY,"That review title above is a straight up fib. It's not at all difficult to predict all the plot twists in DON 2. But so what? For fans of Shahrukh Khan and for those who relish slick action thrillers, DON 2 checks all the boxes. It's been five years since the events in DON, five years since that shocking final reveal. But some things don't change. These days, our guy is still running game on the underworld, still outfoxing the badge and his competitors. The woman he betrayed, Roma Bhagat (Priyanka Chopra), is now an Interpol officer. She's obsessed with nabbing him.

The film opens with Don holding it down as the undisputed kingpin of the Asian underworld, except that he's now got his eye on a take over of the European drug cartel. On the French Riviera, the European bosses attend an emergency meeting to discuss Don's recent actions. Don is jeopardizing their drug empire by undercutting the asking price of their product. What they decide on is inevitable.

Back in Malaysia, Don gets wind of the contract on his head in the rudest of manners. There and then, he determines to be a free man once and for all. He sets into motion one of those whirlwind capers, key elements of which hinge on the springing of his old enemy from prison (Boman Irani) and a daring heist in Berlin. But Don finds himself navigating a nest of vipers, his accomplices composed of deceitful villains. With law enforcement nipping at his heels, has Don at last bitten off more than he can chew? Or does that iconic phrase still hold true? ""Don ko pakadna mushkil hi nahi, namumkim hai."" Translation: ""It is not just difficult to catch Don, it's impossible!""

If you're anticipating a retread of the 2006 film, you need to turn in your anticipating badge. For one thing, there aren't so many swerves in this one. Don does assume a disguise, but it's not as relevant to the plot as much as it is a chance to showcase Hrithik Roshan in a cool cameo (Hrithik even dances with Priyanka). And if that really is Hrithik saying Don's dialogue, then big ups to him for nicely matching Shahrukh's voice and cadence. Don is so gifted, as part of his disguise, he grew a few inches.

I thought Priyanka Chopra did well in a role that required her character, Roma, to be conflicted. Don is so magnetic that Roma still can't help but feel that attraction, never mind that Don had betrayed her, never mind that he'd murdered her brother. Thankfully, the film keeps this sub-plot mostly on simmer, never allows it to take over the narrative. Lara Dutta has a lesser role, filling in for Ishaa Koppikar as Don's most trusted companion. Both women look absolutely devastating!

The manly man's credo: Give me my popcorn and a comfy sofa and babes to ogle and lots of fight scenes and explosions... and I'm good. Because sometimes and maybe most times, I dispense with the artsy-fartsy stuff and I demand to be entertained by a loud action blockbuster. DON 2 lacks the smarts and fascinating twists of the 2006 film. And I don't know that it was a sound move to inject a sliver of conscience into Don. What made him unique was that he was an unrepentant anti-hero, a straight up, no good villain. Or maybe it doesn't matter. Shahrukh Khan's larger-than-life charisma and his showmanship are stamped onto the screen and your eyes are glued to the guy. Shahrukh also performs his own stunts, again perpetuating the notion that absolutely no one can fill his shoes. I guess, one other contention is that I prefer Don to apply his wits to achieve his ends. Here, he frequently resorts to action hero methods. Ultimately, the 2006 film had built up so much cachet I can't dog on its sequel too much. DON 2 is the Hindi version of MISSION IMPOSSIBLE. It's over-the-top and preposterous and great bloody fun. As a fan of Bollywood cinema, I think it's always a treat whenever Boman Irani plays the bad guy. Whether in drama or thriller or comedy, Boman Irani is effortless. There aren't a lot of musical numbers here (I think, three). But the tracks all carry strains of ""Main Hoon Don,"" a club banger from the 2006 film and one of the most addictive, catchy Bollywood songs ever. Okay, another beef? How much more clever would it have been if, instead of Hrithik Roshan, it was Abhishek Bachan whose face Don assumes? Abhishek looks enough like his dad, Amitabh, who played the original Don in 1978, that the reference would've been awesome.

What I have is the 2-disc DVD set. Disc 1 has the feature presentation, available with English sub-titles and the option to jump to any of the film's three musical segments (this last feature is also available on Disc 2). Disc 2 has the following bonus features:

- Making Of featurette (mostly in English, running time 40 minutes)
- Songs: ""Zaraa Dil Ko Thaam Lo,"" Hai Ye Maya,"" ""Dushman Mera""
- (Promotional?) Music Video from DON 2 featuring Shahrukh Khan: ""Mujhko Pehchaanlo""",1352764800,3,4885,4.6469907407407405

They should not have been in such a hurry to produce the movie, that they did such a cheap job in the beginning. It's hard to respect the actors, the producers and director of the film.
