7001753,4,B00T6QIZ7O,"Other than being a little slow at times, it really was an enjoyable movie.  Adam Sandler did a great job in a part that isn't his norm!",1426291200,,135,4.0
7001754,3,B00T6QIZ7O,"Max Simpkin (Adam Sandler) through a series of circumstances discovers he has a machine in his basement that is magical. When used on shoes, it will turn the wearer into someone who looks like its original owner. Max tinkers with the shoes of his customers and finds himself in a situation in a not too well developed story.

The idea was cute. I am not sure that is the way I would have gone. The acting was okay. Steve Buscemi plays a subdued role as a barber. Dustin Hoffman role is slightly beyond that of a cameo. Ellen Barkin looks good for 60.

Makes for an okay rental. Not a laugh out loud type comedy.

Guide: No f-bombs or sex. Woman in shower with some strategic covering.",1426291200,2,684,4.3700787401574805
7001755,5,B00T6QIZ7O,"For the first time in a LONG time, Adam Sandler is in a good movie. The co-stars are amazing as well and them playing Sandler is pretty hysterical.  The plot is not deep and you can see the twists coming a mile away, but overall, it is very watchable and fun.",1426291200,,259,4.078431372549019
7001756,3,B00T6QIZ7O,I really like Adam Sandler but this wasn't what I expected coming from him. His movies are usually funny. I'm just glad I didn't pay a lot. I rented it.,1426291200,2,152,4.1
7001757,4,B00T6QIZ7O,"So, this is a huge departure for Sandler, who we all love for his quirky and often fast paced comedies. In the Cobbler, Sandler is a generation ""Cobbler"" or shoe fixer.  He's less than satisfied with his hum drum existence. The beginning we see just how BLAH he feels his life is. After all, he's just a cobbler, a man who fixes peoples shoes.

However, after his everyday machine creaks and fearing one of his customers he goes to the basement where he uses the ""Old School"" cobbler machine. After fixing the shoes, he tried them on, and is amazed by what he discovers...  Whenever he wears a pair of shoes fixed on the old school machine he is transformed into the shoe's owner.

This is where the true humor begins and mishaps start happening. In trying to do good, it seems he finds himself in more and more impossible situations, that somehow he's able to escape.

The movie definitely isn't the normal fare for most Sandler fans, but for someone like myself who usually isn't laughing when everyone else laughs during a movie, there were some really great moments in this film that had me truly laughing.

It has a good ""moral"" to it, and was a cute even in its somewhat ""dark humor"" kind of way. This isn't Sandlers first time he's chosen a role unSandler - like, but in my opinion, it's his best ""Un-Sandler"" like movie.  If you enjoy darker humor, then I think you'll enjoy this.",1426204800,,1388,4.50597609561753
7001758,3,B00T6QIZ7O,"Watched this for my podcast (The Adam Sandcast) and I was really surprised at what it had to deliver. After seeing the 8% on Rotten Tomatoes, I expected less than nothing from this movie. For the most part, it was a really decent flick. The last 15 or so minutes just devolve into s***, though.

This movie had huge pacing issues. It needed an editor and probably a script rewrite. I expected sandler to be horrible because of the reviews but he seemed to be giving a really great performance in this one and all the actors portraying the people he becomes were solid as well.

Overall, I'd call it a watchable flick. Is beautiful to look at and has fun moments. 3/5.",1426204800,,667,4.414634146341464
7001759,4,B00T6QIZ7O,"I actually detest most Adam Sandler movies. He's usually crude and not that good of an actor, in my opinion. But i actually enjoyed The Cobbler.

Luckily, The Cobbler fit the bill. It was funny, charming, clever and overall very entertaining. The premise of the movie was unique and intriguing, and I enjoyed the plot twists and fantasy moments alike. Adam Sandler was in great form, and the entire supporting cast made the movie work like a well oiled machine (pun intended). I didn't find the characters played by Adam Sandler offensive or distasteful, and there were some real laugh out loud moments. Of course, there were plenty of moments full of genuine sentiment, with lots of lessons to be learned. This is the kind of movie I want in my permanent collection, and if there is going to be a sequel, I can't wait to see it.",1474243200,3,900,4.427710843373494

I truly believe that this is just more personal opinions than facts with this one.  Quite different from his screwball and somewhat crude comedies.  This was more serious, but still had it's funny moments as well.  Serious as not having to go below the belt or get very crude for humor.  That was actually pretty nice.  Good acting all around, great plot.....definitely five stars in my book.  I agree with what another person wrote that this is one of those great sleeper movies.",1459728000,,658,4.594827586206897

7001824,5,B00T6QIZ7O,Adam Sandler always gets my 5 star rating as both an actor and a public figure who treats his audience with respect on and off the stage. He is the only guy out there who really draws that feeling out of me and the memories of how much I loved growing up in the 1970s and 1980s. He embodies the genre and is a superior actor. Thank you Adam for all the years of superior quality entertainment and I hope to see a lot more in the years to come. Wonderful film and pure Sandler quality!,1454371200,,484,4.052083333333333

7001838,4,B00T6QIZ7O,"PLOT...
Max Sinkin (Adam Sandler) is a fourth generation shoe repairman who lives at home with his mother after his father mysteriously disappeared years ago. Disenchanted with the grind of daily life Max stumbles upon an heirloom that magically allows him to step into the life of other people, his life is transformed but he soon discovers walking in another persons shoes has great responsibility and it maybe the only way to find out who you really are.

This is not one of Sandler's best movies of recent years but its still really worth a looking especially if like me your a huge fan of his movies, its not a bad movie its just at a slightly slower pace than usual and the comedy is very watered down, its more of a magical tale of a man trying to make his life better, its certainly your usual warm hearted story you expect with a very predictable outlook from the start but it moves along with a bearable pace with great characters and amusing twists in the middle when he's playing all the different people, I personally still loved it, you have to be a fan or you probably won't have fun with it.

Framing black men for theft (not footing the bill at a restaurant, stealing shoes off someone in the street just to take on their looks to drive a posh car), lack of sexual consent (creating the illusion of being someone else and having an intimate moment in the shower with a stranger...but the stranger believes the main character is someone she actually knows), THIS IS WHERE ADAM SANDLER LOSES ME to the point of no return...the intimate dinner with his mother as he is modeling the role of his father by wearing his shoes.  WEIRD AF.  Save your time...don't watch this.  Plus, the love interest in the movie is seemingly young enough to be his daughter.

7001870,5,B00T6QIZ7O,"The Cobbler isn't your typical Adam Sandler film. There is no Happy Madison logo in the opening credits. I always enjoy Sandler's films. He has a quirky, funny and engaging brand of comedy, but this film is so much different. He has done more lighthearted, semi-serious comedy-drama type films in the past, but this one is a true gem.
In this film, Sandler plays Max Simkin, a cobbler and business owner, who sort of lives with a go with the flow attitude, until he discovers a family heirloom in the shop. I'll just say the old adage from Atticus Finch applies here - ""You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view - until you climb into his skin and walk around in it."" That concept ultimately becomes a major plot element that helps drive the story forward. Simkin finds that if he puts on the shoes he repairs using the special stitcher, he will walk around as the owner of the shoes. At first, Simkin tends to use the shoes for his own personal gain and just to have a little fun. However, he quickly realizes that he can use his new found powers for good. Indeed, that is exactly what he does, though he faces plenty of complications along the way. After all, you have to fill in the script somehow. Ultimately, this helps to drive the story forward and helps to flesh out the characters.

Sandler is joined by a strong, stellar cast of characters including Steve Buscemi (of course), who plays a neighboring barber; Method Man as Leon Ludlow, a bit of a thug, gangster type, whose shoes help to launch the whole ""other man's shoes"" story and who also plays a pivotal role in the overall plot; the legendary Dustin Hoffman, in a supporting role as Max's father and the previous proprietor of the cobbler shop; and Melonie Diaz, as Carmen Herrara, a community organizer, amongst a handful of other fine actors. This Cast really delivers knockout, convincing performances. I have seen some of these actors before in other films, but sometimes it's nice to see lesser known stars performing in films like this. They all really complement Sandler very well.

The ending of this film features a great plot twist that brings the story back to the very beginning of the film, helping to explain the magical stitcher and the role the cobbler plays, from one generation to the next, in the community. It really helps to solidify the overall message of the film. Again, I don't want to give too many spoilers away. Just don't let the first few subtitled minutes of the film drive you away. However, don't forget the subtitles and what is discussed. These are key points that you will better understand at the end of the film.

This film is well worth your time and effort to watch. I can't recommend it enough.",1443916800,,2746,4.6

His movies lead me to bouts of deep thinking  - mostly about how we do and could relate to one another - and I applaud that.
This is not a troubling movie or overly serious, but it's one that will make you think about what's really important in life while telling a sweet story in an enjoyable way.

Mid way through the movie, this simple life becomes extremely complex and active as he discovers a bit of magic in the basement of his shop!
The movie exemplifies the importance of friends, love of family, and doing the right thing.

a slight twist at the end!  I enjoyed this movie even though it was different, it makes for a good rainy day time of movie.
After watching it you may say it was okay or slow, but I thought it moved along okay and enjoyed the light storyline and some of the characters made me laugh.  Too me it was a bit better than okay so I gave it a 4 star, definately not his best movie but I don't think it's his

It's sort of getting old (no offense). But this, I absolutely loved it. It's totally original, with great actors and a wonderful story. People may think it's a comedy simply because Adam is in it, but it's actually a drama with a hint of comedy inside. I would say that's why people are giving it negative reviews, because they're expecting it to be funny.
The story is about a middle-aged man who's running his family's show repair shop. His father left him and his mom, so now he's taking care of the shop despite his distaste for it. One day his machine to sew the soles of the shoes broke, so he uses an old one that was in the store basement to fix it. The man of the particular shoes he fixes doesn't show up, so for fun he decides to try them on and he becomes that man! From there the story gets really good, and I don't want to spoil much else.
Give it a try, knowing it will be funny at times, but is definitely a more serious role for Adam Sandler! And it was really a huge relief from all of the sequels and remakes!",1436227200,,1185,4.134199134199134

There was an engaging story line, the characters were pretty good, and there were interesting twists and turns.

Adam Sandler still seems a bit lost here and there in front of the camera, but I think he did a particularly good job of playing the middle aged tradesman stuck in a rut and little hope for the future.  Then when the story line takes an unexpected turn his character comes alive.

I loved the back story, costuming, and cast selection.

This is an interesting fantasy tale that is best if you don't know anything in advance about the story line.

Also if you go into it with low enough expectations like I did, you will probably deeply enjoy it.

All in all a strong showing from Adam Sandler worth 4 solid stars.",1435708800,,900,4.512345679012346
7001980,1,B00T6QIZ7O,"I was completely disappointed, as Sandler, my all-time favorite actor, only appeared in about 20 minutes of the movies entire footage and thus merely stole the limelight by placing his name on the front cover.  The limelight was nothing, I suppose, compared to the embezzled $150,000, the man who was murdered with the stiletto heel, and the poor girl our friendly, neighborhood cobbler tried to bang in the shower before he realized that would be rather difficult without the shoes that made him look like said girls boyfriend.  Perhaps that last bit was actually okay, though, as theres a good chance the real boyfriend was out with his own boyfriend at the time.
 Underneath the blatant spoof of the mob that made up 90% of the movies theme, though, was the classic sentimental Sandler theme of the cobblers family.  Had the satirical portions of the mobster theme been cut WAY back and more logical connections been made between it and the family theme, The Cobbler may have actually turned out to be quite a politically interesting and lovely movie.",1435708800,,1054,4.871508379888268
7001981,2,B00T6QIZ7O,"In Cobbler Adam Sandler is Max Simkin, a middle-aged cobbler living in New York City. Because of a magical sewing machine his father (now missing) possessed, Max gains a special ability to become the wearer of the shoes he mended with the machine. Now Maxs monotonous life is about to change for the better or maybe worse.

The films unusual premise is clearly inspired by the old adage to put yourself in someone else's shoes, but writers Thomas McCarthy (who also directs) and Paul Sado do not seem to know what to do with this idea. The result is a mish-mash of drama and comedy that is not as compelling or funny as they should be.

One notable thing about The Cobbler is the talent involved. The supporting cast includes Ellen Barkin, Steve Buscemi, Dustin Hoffman and Dan Stevens. Sorry, but they are all wasted in the weak story. This is all the more disappointing because the film directed by Thomas McCarthy, who did far better jobs in The Visitor and Win-Win.",1435708800,,969,4.627906976744186

7002009,5,B00T6QIZ7O,"Adam Sandler films usually fall into one of three categories - the horrid, the wretched and the direct to landfill. It's not that Sandler's offerings are completely humorless, it's just that most of the halfway decent material is routinely crammed into the trailer relegating the remaining 127 minutes of run time to crude, pre-pubescent comedy only amusing to a 13 y/o boy hugging the maturity line somewhere between PlayStation obsessions and daddy's magazine collection.

So, as I was literally forced to endure his latest release The Cobbler this past weekend, I was beside myself contemplating two things as pigs were flying around my head - Sandler can act and, there were no reference whatsoever to bodily functions or fluids anywhere in the script. Yes, the film borrows liberally from the major time-travel, shape-shifting fantasy releases of the past thirty years (ie  Big, Groundhog Day, Pleasantville and even Sandler's own Click) but his turn as a reluctant and depressed cobbler who literally follows in his father's footsteps ( A check is in the mail trifle from Dustin Hoffman) running a lower East Side shoe repair is a finely articulated performance of a forlorn middle-aged man reconnecting with the world through the metaphysical properties of his customer's shoes (It sounds a lot dumber than it plays on screen.)

Saying anything more would spoil the movie and it's largely unexpected reveal but The Cobbler is a film that is well worth your time and at the very least will give you permission to say with a straight face that Adam Sandler didn't always mail it in.",1434931200,,1587,5.026615969581749

7002039,4,B00T6QIZ7O,"Adam Sandler does magical realism. No, that's not a joke, that's the basic premise of The Cobbler.

The only funny thing here, though, is that it actually works. I noticed that this movie got savaged by critics, but audiences seemed to adore it. It was some of the starkest polarization I'd seen over a movie in a long time. I was worried that Sandler fans (you know, people who actually thought Jack and Jill was a good movie... yes, they exist,) just bombed the reviews. But then I actually watched it, and by all accounts, I found a movie that typical Sandler diehards would hate. Why? Because The Cobbler is, in reality, a very thoughtful, meditative movie about trying to find a happy medium between your current life and your dream one.

Seriously. I'm not kidding.

Sandler and ""thoughtful"" might not mentally go hand-in-hand at first, but think about some of the roles the actor has taken over the years. He was the awkward, affable lead in Punch Drunk Love, a tragic comedian in Funny People, and an emotionally damaged musician in Reign Over Me. The guy has a pretty good range, even if most of his movies as of late are pretty much garbage. Don't count Cobbler among them, though. Here, we see him tone down his ""I'm a living cartoon character"" routine and actually turn in a performance that's almost subdued.

""Almost,"" I say, because the basic premise of the movie requires Sandler to be a little reactive at times. See, he plays a cobbler, or in everyday terms, a shoe repair guy. Living in an older neighborhood on the verge of corporate buyout and taking care of his dying mother, his life is fairly miserable. That starts to change when he finds an old shoe repair machine that, by fixing somebody else's shoes and wearing them, allows him to transform into other people.

If this sounds like a premise for Sandler to get into wacky shenanigans, that's because we're conditioned to believe that's all he's capable of these days. And, I'll be honest, I thought that's where this was heading too. In reality, it takes a turn into some dark, treacherous territory that I didn't see coming. Murder happens. The effects of gentrification are touched upon. Dustin Hoffman shows up. All-in-all, it's just a really strange trip that takes bizarre turn after bizarre turn, until the ending, which is one of the most out-of-the-blue and, dare I say it, smartest endings I've seen in a minute.

Now if you were to ask me if The Cobbler is Oscar-bait or anything, I'd first ask why you think I care about the Oscars (considering how abysmal Birdman was and how nobody could shut up about it,) and I'd then say ""no."" It's too original, and honestly, it's a bit too out there. That's evidenced by the negative critic reviews, most of which center around it not being a good Sandler movie. Which is true. It's not. It's an awful Sandler movie. But, really, I don't think it was trying to be a Sandler movie to begin with. I think it was just trying to be a movie that happened to have Adam Sandler in the lead, which works for the part.

The Cobbler isn't necessarily perfect. It has some pacing issues. I didn't care for its questionable depictions of African-Americans and (in one instance) transgender people. But I will say this: it kept me thinking after the credits had rolled, and most movies don't do that anymore. And what's more, I plan on watching it one or two more times, because I think there's stuff I may have missed. And that would require buying it, probably on a discount.

So, yeah. I'm not sure The Cobbler is a great film, and your mileage may vary. But, for my purposes, it was a surprisingly sentimental and thoughtful journey, and one that I'd recommend most people at least try taking.",1434153600,,3714,4.625189681335357

There's only a little bit in the middle, when the main character goes to a bar incognito, where it got just a little iffy for kids.  Innuendo.  Then a woman shows more than a little skin in the shower.  Nothing R-rated, obviously.  But the suggestion is strong.  That's all, though, and really not that much.

Adam Sandler is one of my fav's for SNL was funnier when he was on it. Mr. Sandler usually puts out a very excellent product and in this movie he excels with comedy and a very touching story with actual family values involved.  I loved the movie and I am sorry the public apparently did not watch it because there was other big big movies that had to be seen. I don't even think the movie got a fair shake because of blockbusters to compete with sort of makes you long for the old days of mom & pop theatre's in the neighborhood.

The Cobbler is a fantastic movie that demands, and requires, your undivided attention so each facet of the story line blends seamlessly into the next. For the movie buffs that tend to predict whats going to happen next this movie keeps you on the edge of your seat, and you may find yourself getting gleefully lost in the highly imaginative and creative world of a man and his customers shoes. Let go of any preconceived notions of what you think this movie is about and grab your inner child for a film you had no idea you couldn't wait to see.",1431561600,2,697,4.410852713178294

would love. Anyway mine did! So nice they watched it twice! in a row'-) It has a very original plot and great character development.
Better than Sandler's Bedtime stories. He should make films like this more often!  95% of hollywood flicks for sometime have not
been good let alone great. I've watched cinema from around the world including the classics. I also watch a lot of family friendly fare/

7002212,4,B00T6QIZ7O,"For those that have passed on Adam Sandler lately because of the adolescent attitude of some of his films, give this a view.  It is a entertaining adult fable that you will find amusing.  It gives a new meaning to the line ""you don't know a man until you've been in his shoes"".  A mid-thirties cobbler in New York with a very boring life is still living with his mother.  His father left years earlier.  He accidently finds out that when he puts new soles on shoes with the help of a old stitching machine (alleged given to his great grandfather by a angel) that if he puts the shoes on he looks and talks like the person who owns the shoes.  The ability that at first seems like fun, later comes in handy as things in the neighborhood start to go awry.  This piece of Hollywood escapism is slow at the beginning and middle, but comes together in a interesting and entertaining way.  Well worth a watch, recommended.",1429574400,,916,4.378698224852071

When his machine breaks he begins to use an old one that has been hidden for years. What he discovers is an amazing new life, and a way to change things. This is a very sweet movie. Some parts are a little too intense but for the most part this is a decent family movie. This is not a typical Sandler movie, this is more along the lines of Click or Bedtime Stories. The idea is pretty original and I really liked this, even though the ending was a little predictable. That in no way hurt the movie though and I did enjoy this quite a bit.

7002215,4,B00T6QIZ7O,"Prior to it being released on Amazon Instant Videos, I had never even heard of The Cobbler. I decided to watch the trailer, but I wasn't overly impressed. It looked so silly! But then I thought, this is Adam Sandler! I DIG his silly!!

So I bought it, but I didn't watch it right away, simply because I was waiting for a time when I needed a mental break from the day-to-day. (I didn't have to wait too long.) The film was quite enjoyable! It wasn't as goofy as The Waterboy or Billy Madison, nor was it too dramatic like Spanglish. It was funny in parts, quite touching in others, and it flat-out surprised me. I am a HUGE Adam Sandler fan! His movies are my go-to when I'm looking for a break from having to THINK. I'm not a fan of all of his movies... there are a handful that even I can't get into. But for the most part, I enjoy watching his films because I can disconnect my brain and put all of my stresses on pause. I love his films for that reason! They're mindlessly FUN!!!

And that's what this film is: fun.

Don't watch it if you're expecting a well thought-out plot, (the movie should've ended ten minutes before the credits, something was introduced that left a LOT of unanswered questions, but it doesn't ruin the overall effectiveness of the movie), or if you're expecting academy award-winning acting. You WILL be disappointed.

Just remember: there is ONE THING you have to keep in mind--this is Adam Sandler that we're talking about!

So put aside your high expectations, or your critic checklist, and just enjoy the film for what it is... carefree, mindless FUN!!",1429488000,2,1584,4.486111111111111

Steve Buscemi, and Dustin Hoffman add star power but don't suffocate the story.

Adam Sandler treats it completely matter-of-factly, and that works for this story. It's like a fairy tale, or a bedtime story, and if you relax and let someone tell you a story, you'll enjoy it. It's low key in tone, with a variety of interesting characters and locations to take in. It's not an adventure so much as a curious tale. And in that way it is actually pleasant, and unassumingly comfortable, like an old pair of shoes. It's only failure is when it departs from this formula, and tries to make the ending too grandiose.",1427500800,,681,4.3700787401574805

7002323,2,B00T6QIZ7O,"I'll start off this review by saying this is without a doubt one of the strangest films I've ever seen. I had actually been looking forward to it because McCarthy's past films have been good and it was nice to see Sandler in a different type of film. It wasn't terrible, but it certainly wasn't good either.

I really have no clue what McCarthy was going for here. The film starts off as an old-fashioned comedy with some drama thrown in, but it eventually becomes jumbled in a bunch of subplots that involve saving the neighborhood a murder plot involving gangsters. Parts of it get a bit dark and surprisingly violent for a PG-13. It's a mix of a dramedy, fantasy comedy, and crime thriller that never mash together leading to the film having a major identity crisis.

I think some people are pinning it on Sandler being the problem here, but he is actually decent in his role. Although, I found it strange that they chose to show the other actors in the roles of the side characters when Sandler is ""in their shoes"". It would have been funnier and much more enjoyable if it had been done the other way around. Steve Buscemi and Dustin Hoffman also appear briefly in the film, but neither of them are giving much to do.

The main reason why the film fails is because of it's script. As previously mentioned, the film is an uneven mess. McCarthy and Paul Sado are the only writers, but it feels like they had several people write various subplots that were all mashed together. This could have easily been a PG-rated family film if it hadn't been for brief moments of unnecessary nudity and violence that don't serve any purpose. Aside from the unevenness of the whole film, the writing itself is pretty poor. Some of the dialogue is laughably awful and incredibly forced, most of which comes from Melonie Diaz and Method Man's characters. With that said, none of the dialogue is clever or good, but some of the more established actors such as Sandler and Steve Buscemi. There is a point where it seems like the film could take a route of having a message about the way a community interacts with one another, but nothing ever comes of it resulting in a rather predictable story in which the twist can be solved about halfway through.

Despite all of it's missteps, The Cobbler does have a few factors that keep it from being a complete disaster. Sandler himself does a decent job in the lead role. It's not a particularity memorable one despite going out of his comfort zone, but he fits the role and uses that to his advantage. Despite being wasted, the film does feature a great cast including Steve Buscemi, Dustin Hoffman, and Dan Stevens who while given little to do, are nice to see on screen. Even though the story itself is pretty predictable, I never found myself bored during the film's runtime. I'm not sure if it's because of how bizarrely awful some of it is, but the strangeness of the whole thing is enough to keep you amused just to see where it will end up next. Even though I didn't laugh once throughout the entire film, there are some occasional chuckle worthy moments such as a montage early on of Sandler discovering his new ability.

After a long string of bad comedies, I was really hoping The Cobbler would be a step back in the right director for Sandler. Unfortunately, it ends up being a bigger misstep for director Thomas McCarthy. There was potential for this to be something noteworthy for the two of them. Instead, it's cluttered mess of a film that's almost admirable in how bizarre it is. The Cobbler is no Jack & Jill by any means, but it certainly isn't going to do an favors for Sandler's career either.",1427068800,32,3642,4.545731707317073

7002353,4,B00T6QIZ7O,I was prepared to not like this since I am not an Adam Sandler fan. I was very glad to be wrong. This was a delightful touching movie. It had a wonderful tender side mixed with humor and a bit of quirkiness. The supporting characters were wonderful. The director and director of photography did a lovely job of making you feel that you were right there in Brooklyn with the neighborhood shots. It's the best thing I have seen Mr. Sandler do plus I believed in the magic!,1426464000,,470,4.3522727272727275
7002354,3,B00T6QIZ7O,"I had the time to go see this movie and to me Adam Sandler movies seem to be a hit or miss. Personally, I liked his recent works like Grown Ups and Just Go With it so I was interested in seeing what this movie can do. However I walked in knowing full well that the movie would either entertain me or bore me to death. Unfortunately, it is sad to say that this film was the more negative of the two.

I am not a film critic and I did not go into this film hoping that it would win any awards. I just wanted a good time with a film that I get with well done comedies. However, this movie failed at the comedy that they attempted at. Adam Sandler does get into some unusual circumstances that are quite unfortunate, but as a whole it really kind of did not do well.

The story revolves around Sandler who is a 4th generation cobbler and he is living with his mother because his father had run out on them years ago. Sandler feels as if he is running the shop only to keep things going and that he is unable to pursue his own interests because his father had run away. A drug dealer comes into the shop one day and requests that Sandler fix the soles of his shoes but when Sandler begins to work on them, his machine breaks. He then goes down to the basement to use this old stitcher that his family has had for generations but there is great mystery around it. After stitching the shoes up, he puts them on and realizes that he has become the drug dealer. He immediately takes them off and he has reverted to his normal self. Sandler then realizes that the stitcher allows him to turn into anyone whose shoes that he has stitched with the stitcher and the story kind of starts from there.

The premise of the story is very interesting and unique and I really like the play on words that they did with ""Put yourself in someone eles's shoes"" and I really thought the movie would go somewhere now that Sandler had the ability to basically turn into anyone as long as he has their shoes. There is a second part of the story where the community where his shop is located, is in danger of being torn down to make a spot for resort/ vacation places for the rich but they lightly touch on the subject without getting anywhere until the end. The movie would have been a lot better if this issue was central to the character building of Sandler, but most of the movie he just turns into random people, doing random things which are more often stealing and being selfish, until the very end he just magically decides to be a good person.

I would even give this movie four stars if it is directed towards kids because there are some really good messages here but I think the movie has a problem with finding its target audience. Most of the time it seems as if it oriented to children with Sandler not using his usual crude jokes but the movie also has partial nudity and blood. This movie had a great story and lots of potential to actually be good but in the end it just fell because of poor execution. The Cobbler has an identity crisis and I just think that they tried to put too much into such a short movie. Do not waste your money at the theaters and give this a skip until it's available for rental.",1426377600,18,3193,4.2039151712887435
7002355,3,B00T6QIZ7O,"I was hoping there would be some depth here, as the door was opened for that possibility. But with Adam Sandler it seems that you get only two speeds: the sophomoric class clown goofball of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/You-Don-t-Mess-With-The-Zohan/dp/B001HMPJ8I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">You Don't Mess With The Zohan</a>, or a slightly more subtle brand of humor like The Cobbler. It's unfortunate that nothing was made of the proverb ""don't judge a man until you've walked two moons in his moccasins"" (updated for our culture of time poverty to be ""a mile"" instead of ""two moons""), as The Cobbler introduced the perfect scenario to examine what this means. Instead, our hero foils crime and gets the girl (yawn).

PROs
 Actors. Ellen Barkin: she's kept busy, but not in films I've heard of; last time I saw her must have been in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Adventures-of-Buckaroo-Banzai-Across-the-Eighth-Dimension/dp/B00005JKEX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the Eighth Dimension</a>&nbsp;(realizing that makes me feel as old as she looks). Dustin Hoffman: adds credibility to most any movie. Steve Buscemi: two problems here [1] he is normally lightning in a bottle, but this script doesn't give him a chance to shine, and [2] I see Nucky Thompson when I look at him. Melonie Diaz: perfect pick for her role. Method Man: never heard of him, but he acts well enough as the degenerate who introduces the protagonist into a web of crime. Sandler: not being terribly familiar with his filmography, I was impressed to learn that he has a little bit of range as a performer here (i.e., can do more than act like a putz).
 The Cobbler doesn't shy away from a real issue in Manhattan: gentrification has already uprooted much of the Lower East Side's cultural heritage (having lived in the LES long ago, it's almost depressing when returning for a visit).

CONs
 While not short on humor, The Cobbler wanted to be something more than a comedy, but didn't convincingly pull it off (whatever ""it"" was).
 The ""mystery"" of what happened to the protagonist's father can be solved from a mile away.
 Missed opportunity to explore what it truly means to walk in another's shoes. Had it gone down that path, it may have been funnier also.
