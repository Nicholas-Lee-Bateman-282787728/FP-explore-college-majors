7905008,5,B000006QO2,"This documentary actually brings one onto a battleship. I could feel the projectiles whizzing overhead. I could empathize with the sailors on each ship.  I could feel the sadness and pain of the sailors on Bismark realizing she was disabled the night before her eventual sinking and that they would never see mother, sweetheart or country again.  I could sense the tradgedy of the total obliteration of the Hood.  I could see the carnage.  I have never seen the likes of this incredible documentary!  I wish there were a way to give it 50 stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1367193600,,557,4.821052631578947
7905009,5,B000006QO2,"I recently watched this special on the History Channel. While I found it to be a little long, it was never boring. It excellently tells the story of the brief life and the death of the pride of the German Kriegsmarine, the Battleship Bismarck.
When the Bismarck was launched at Hamburg on Valentines Day, 1939, it was a proud day for the Third Reich; Another addition to their expanding fleet. However, they where far from being ready for battle with the Royal Navy. But Hitler presumed that war with Britain would not come till at least 1946. However in September, 1939, a few days after German armies invaded Poland, Britain declared war.
Since the German fleet was still too weak to face Britain's navy, it was decided that they would participate in commerce raiding. Instead of attacking offensively, the German fleet would hit the convoys coming from America to Britain, thus strangling Great Britain. In this role, the Bismarck would be the ultimate raider. However, the video also tells about Hitler's dislike of this role for the high seas fleet. He found it to be unsuitable for these glorious ships. He once remarked to fleet commander Admiral Erich Raeder ""On land, I am a hero. At sea, I am a coward"".
Many survivors from both the German and British sides are interviewed and shed a different light on the Bismarck that a book or a video can't provide. British seaman Ted Briggs tells us that he first wanted to join the Royal Navy when he first saw the H.M.S Hood. Later, he served on that ship when she was sunk by Bismarck and was one of only three of here crew to survive. Another interesting bit of information is told by one of Bismarck's former crewman: He says that Captain Lindemann thought the Bismarck was too big and powerful to be a female. Thus, he told his men that they will call the ship He instead of She.
The video discusses about the various twists and turns in the sea chase as well as the blunders made by both sides: The decision of the Bismarck's builders to ignore the problems that would occur when the rudder was disabled. The decision of German Admiral Lutjens not to refuel the ship when he had the chance. The decision for the Bismarck's crew to break radio silence and give her (I mean Him) position away to the British. The mis-caculation of British Admiral Tovey of the Bismarck's location. The various accidental attacks by British planes on the wrong ships (Fortunately, none where hit). Also, there is the dumb luck of the torpedo plane that crippled the Bismarck's rudder. Finally, there is the controversial decision of the captain of the cruiser Dorsetshire to stop the rescue of Bismarck survivors and steam away because of a U-boat sighting.
I cannot recommend this documentary enough. For another great Bismarck documentary, watch the shorter and more basic but also entertaining ""Search for Battleship Bismarck"", which also details about Dr. Robert Ballard's successful hunt for the wreck of the Bismarck. Also read a book on the Bismarck, which (Unlike movies) don't have to be edited.",997660800,14,3041,4.772296015180266
7905010,5,B000006QO2,"I was glued to my TV the first, second,and third time that I watched this documentary.  It just wasn't a great documentary - it was exceptional!  It gives the viewer background on this episode in history and then follows  through with a detailed account of the voyage of the Bismarck.  The  interviews weren't even boring, they provided fascinating background.  The  best part of the video is the live film footage of the Bismarck, Eugen and  British ships.  Included in the films are live fire sequences.  This is  history at its best.  This ranks as one of the best historical videos that  I have ever seen.  Save your money on the movie, buy this documentary  instead - it is the REAL thing.  Well done!",962323200,11,706,4.617886178861789
7905011,5,B000006QO2,"This documentary almost puts you in the action!  It includes interviews with survivors from action between the Bismarck and its adversaries.  Just a very well done factual account of one of the most intriguing sea chases  in the history of naval warfare.  I read the book Sink the Bismarck as an  eighth grader and since then I have always been fascinated by the  Bismarck's story.  This documentary is just the icing on the cake.  I would  recommend it to those people serious about the factual side of history;  real life, particularly in wartime, doesn't need any dramatization!  Excellent!",953424000,3,593,4.948979591836735
7905012,1,B000006QO2,Although this documentary may be very good...it is NOT a colorized version of the original Sink the Bismarck movie!  We bought it as a gift for someone who had asked for the movie and were VERY disappointed!,946166400,3,207,4.594594594594595
