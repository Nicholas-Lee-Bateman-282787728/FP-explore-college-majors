7973834,4,B0000714EK,"Though this documentary was made before Jamie Foxx's ""Ray"" performance and Oscar win, it remains true to the interviews that he did at that time.  The first half of the disc is all about his filial piety toward his grandparents/adoptive parents.  It was not surprising to see comedians such as Mo'nique or Keenan Ivory Wayans interviewed, but Gladys Knight and Oliver Stone were interviewed as well.  His Wanda character and his role in ""Any Given Sunday"" are not brought up until halfway into the documentary.  BET bleep out some of the cursing in his film clips, but while interviewing him several curse words are not bleeped out.  Not only do you get to see a younger Jamie sporting what he admits was an imitation Lionel Richie curl, but throughout this piece he's wearing a number of stocking caps on his head, like he's growing sporting waves or something.  Jamie's humor shines through: even during this serious interview, he cracks jokes almost unintentionally that are downright hilarious.",1117065600,4,998,4.981927710843373
