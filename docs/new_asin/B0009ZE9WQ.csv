I suggest turning on the subtitles when you are watching it English because they translate some of the Japanese writing on the signs you otherwise will be missing.",1143072000,6,371,4.455882352941177
2344697,5,B0009ZE9WQ,"I'm a minister, and enjoy seeing thought-provoking presentations of theological ideas in mainstream culture.

This anime is all about one girl's experiences learning what makes someone a complete and mature and helpful person.

She is reborn as a somewhat-angel-like creature with very little memory of her past life, in a community with others like her.  We follow her experiences as she wonders what she is, where she is, and how she fits in.

Although she is a fairly good and kind person, she has a few small vices which get her in trouble.  Notably, after a friend departs she is burdened until she learns how to cope.  Then it is her turn to help someone else with their coping issues.

The presentation is slow-paced but impeccably done.  I couldn't ask for anything to be improved.

Don't read any spoilers!  Let the story guide you the first time you watch it.  Afterwards, the Wikipedia page on this series is well written and might be of help in processing thoughts.",1142121600,57,977,4.755952380952381
2344698,5,B0009ZE9WQ,"Yeah I know responding to other posts is bad etiquette.  But this is a deal so print it as one.  Most DVD sets are over a hundred for the lot, usually which is only 26 episodes.  And you also usually are charged per disc.  This gives you close to the actual price.  Actually less than it.  I got a used disc which was imported for less, but the DVD eventually degraded so I need to get a new one.

Another thing.  You're basing it on used prices?  Sometimes the ""used"" sellers will overcharge.  Second the used price of this box set right now is under the price you just listed.",1135296000,4,578,4.172727272727273
2344699,5,B0009ZE9WQ,"This is an excellent anime. But I suggest that you purchase its 4 individual DVDs through the marketplace sellers instead. Because they are sold at the ""used"" price guideline, they're usually much cheaper than ordering the official boxed set. What I did was buy the collector's box for volume 1 and then subsequently fill it up with the rest of the 3 volumes. The grand total came out to be $60. This is actually $30 less than the price which is being sold here. Trust me, it's exactly the same thing while it's much easier on your wallet.",1122076800,10,539,4.510204081632653
2344720,5,B0009ZE9WQ,"I don't usually do reviews, but this series is worth it.  This is my favorite series of all time.  The animation is artistic and well-drawn, the characters are compelling, and the story draws you in like no other anime or movie I've ever watched.  It is rather symbolic and takes its time developing the story, so if you're just up for a fast action or crazy romance anime, this series may not be for you.  It is thought-provoking and continually interesting throughout, and the ending is the most fantastic and satisfying I have ever experienced in an anime series.  I'm not going to give anything away (and don't let anyone else either!), but Haibane Renmei, I suspect, has a slightly different meaning for everyone who watches it.
In short, an underrated and terrific show.  I highly, highly recommend it.",1202774400,3,808,4.776978417266187

This is a extremely touching story that you will instantly relate to if you've ever lost anyone or anything you held dear at a time.  It will touch you in a way you thought forgotten when you lost that someone or something you once held dear.  Emotions will resurface that reminds you of what it means to love and to have lost.  You will fall in love with the characters as they are rich and deep in personality.  This is my favorite anime among other animes I enjoy like Ninja Scroll.

If you have any hesitations about this, you will not regret watching it (if you watch the entire series).",1202342400,2,688,4.3359375
2344722,5,B0009ZE9WQ,"This show is very interesting if you have the patience and attention span to go through it from beginning to end. warning, if you like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Akira-Special-Edition/dp/B00005MAM2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Akira (Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;(yuck)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ninja-Scroll/dp/6305014140/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ninja Scroll</a>&nbsp;(yuck) or any of those super action sex filled movies and shows that have someone dieing every two minutes, you might as well skip this show as no one dies, no one gets their arms cut off, and there are no explosions during the entire 13 episode series, which is just fine with me but may turn the more superficial anime fans off.

the story is mostly about a young Haibane (pronounced Hi-ba-nA) named Rakka who is a new born Haibane who is trying to figure out her place in the world she lives in. the Haibane are an angelic race with seeming less useless wings and halos that hover over their heads making look like biblical angles, but other than appearances, these creatures have almost nothing in common with the angelic being of the bible; instead they act and look just like normal human beings just with a different set of rules and pasts. Nobody really knows what they are, or where they came from, but each has an uneasy feeling that they don't belong, that they came from somewhere else before becoming Haibane. This sense of unease is what drives Rakka for most of the beginning of the series. She tries very hard to figure out who she was, where she came from, and why she is now a Haibane. Sadly, the answers never come to her, but we are given some rather depressing hints on what she was before.

So what is this series about really? What is the plot? Well, that's a little hard to explain. Its not so much what this story is about, it's who it is about. The plot is almost none existent in the first half of the series, and even when it gets more involved it's not really that interesting. No, the plot is not what makes this story good in any way, it's the characters. Each character is very likable and sympathetic. There is no ""bad guy"" in this series, and there are no ""heroes"" either. Each character here is a person, with a unique personality and view on life. Each has their own quirks, fears, likes and dislikes. Each is as real as a fictional character can be, and I applauded the writers of this show for achieving this. The depression Rakka goes through half way though the series when she looses her friend is very real, as well as Reki's fear and loneness at the end. They are so real that when they went though pain of any kind, no matter how much or how little, I felt my heart break for them. I felt pain when Rakka's wings burst though her back, I felt sad when a character left, I felt lonely when one of the characters was alone, afraid when they were afraid. So in short, this story isn't really about anything in particular, it's about people. The begining of the series is mostly just a set up, but trust me, once Rakka's wings start turning black, it gets very dramatic.

The animation reminded me a lot of Full Mettle Alcamist and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Serial-Experiments-Lain-Boxed-Set-Signature-Series/dp/B00067Z2X2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Serial Experiments Lain - Boxed Set (Signature Series)</a>. I've never seen a lot of Alcamist, but the backgrounds are very similar, and there is a striking resemblance between Lain from Serial Experiments Lain, and Rakka from this series. Both look young, alone, innocent. The character designs are a notch above average. They aren't eye candy but they do go above a lot of amines I've seen before, and no two characters look alike which makes remember their names a lot easier. The backgrounds are really the eye candy here. It's simply beautiful. I've always love scenery shots of green meadows, or large forests, or a windmill rotating in a gentle breeze. This show is chuck full of such shots. Once again, if you're looking for large cities and fancy sci fi machines, look elsewhere, this show isn't for you. You'd probably just end up being board.

However, it isn't' perfect. There are some things that really got on my nerves. The first thing is that there aren't any male leads. There aren't any dudes in this series. The biggest male role in this whole series doesn't show up until half way though the series and play a lack luster role at that. He shows up on screen at most ten times in thirteen episodes, and even then most of the time he's there for a whopping 1 to 3 minutes. As much as I love female anime characters, there needs to be a guy playing a main role in there somewhere just to get a little bit of a different perspective. They try to make up for this by making two of the girls tomboys, but I'm sorry, tomboys, although cool, do not count as guys. One of these tomboys, Kuu, only dresses like a boy but acts like any other girl. The other, Kana, I actually mistook for a boy at first because she acted so much like a boy her age would, but sadly she turned out to be a girl after all. All I'm asking for is to have a male lead here, instead of just a bunch of girls. Is that so bad? this series could have very easily tuned into just another chick flick, but managed to stray away from that by refusing to be a romance (thank god for that).

The dub may not be the best dub in the world, certainly not up to par with Lain or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kino-s-Journey-The-Idle-Adventurer-Vol-1/dp/B00018D4XQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kino's Journey - The Idle Adventurer (Vol. 1)</a>, but it is passable for the most part. There were times when Rakka's super (and I do mean super) soft voice just annoyed the hell out of me, but most of the time I didn't really notice. The other characters voices were good, especially Kana's, who stole the show with her constant attack on the crows that scavenged though their trash. As for the dialog, the middle part of the series had some really cheesy moments, but only a few, but they were pretty bad. Other than that, it was mostly real and believable.

This show isn't about action and it isn't sci fi. It's a character drama. Its really hard to compare it to other anime when the only other hard character drama's I've seen are&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Now-and-Then-Here-and-There-Complete-Collector-s-Boxed-Set/dp/B000063K2C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Now and Then, Here and There (Complete Collector's Boxed Set)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grave-of-the-Fireflies-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B00006HAWP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grave of the Fireflies (Collector's Edition)</a>, and this series has none of the horridness situations, nor the anti war themes of those two anime's. If I had to compare it to something, I'd say it has more in common with Miyazaki's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spirited-Away/dp/B00005JLEU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spirited Away</a>&nbsp;than anything else but it's really different at the same time.

So, if you are looking for a drama with characters you can love and sympathize with and don't mind a slower pace and lack of action, by all means, pick this baby up and enjoy. but, and I've given you people fare warning, if you are an action junky who needs someone killed or something blowing up every ten minutes just to keep you watching, SKIP THIS SERIES!! I guarantee you, you will not like it. To truly enjoy this series, you have to be able to pay attention to the characters and their emotions because when it comes right down to this, this series is all about them, not you.

Haibane Renmei is one of those exceptions. Regardless of whether or not you have any interest in anime, per se, this is very much worth your time.

2344725,5,B0009ZE9WQ,"SERIES REVIEW:

What a divine series this is - in every aspect of the word. I finished watching Haibane Renmei I began enthusiastically recommending it to my friends. When one asked ""So what makes it good?"", funny thing was, I couldn't really answer it. There's almost no conflict or action in the series. There's no traditional good guys VS bad guys, no spellbinding magic, no science fiction - not a trace of computers, aliens or mecha. There are fantasy elements, but they're kept to such a small, human level that you can't really call this series a fantasy in the traditional sense. So what is Haibane Renmei?

It tells the story of a group of angel-like beings called Haibane. They're born from cocoons, grow wings, given halos, and have no memories of their past other than the dream each has in the cocoon. They all live in a protected city called Glie, where nobody is allowed to go beyond the walls. The Haibane are watched over and protected by a group called the Haibane Renmei. Haibane must each work to support themselves, and do their best to be a ""good Haibane"". It tells the story of one such Haibane - Rakka - coming into the world, and learning how to live in it. The supporting cast of Old Home (where they live) is equally essential. Towards the finale, much of the focus shifts from Rakka to Reki - one of the elder Haibane, who is a mother figure to those in Old Home. Then there's Kuu, Kana, Hikari, and Nemu whom all have very different, but likable personalities.

Haibane Renmei moves at life's pace. Slow and deliberately it moves through its stages - dealing with many humanistic themes along the way. Moving through seasons and emotions with dignity and grace. It would be very easy for fans of traditional anime to consider this series ""boring"", as it's certainly not exciting in any traditional sense. You really have to be in a certain mood to appreciate Haibane Renmei's charm.

Yoshitoshi ABe (Original Story, Character Designs) said when he began Haibane Renmei that he had no set idea where he was going with it all, creating the story in the moment. In this light, Haibane Renmei becomes like a stream of conscious meditation on life. He also said that while Haibane Renmei has a religious feel, it is not about any particular religion. It is really a type of spiritual and emotional journey. There are anime series that that are very much allegorical. Haibane Renmei works more like CS Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia in that it deals more in allusions than strict allegory. This means its more open to personal interpretations - and all the better because of it.

In a way, this series reminds me of the anime equivalent of Yasujiro Ozu's films. Ozu is a director who focused on regular people in everyday life confronting life's small, but meaningful moments. His films, like Haibane Renmei, rarely have any big emotion or big drama. It's all about calm reflection as we move through life. The viewer is never forced into the story or the characters. Rather, we're given time to relate these characters to our own life. Their moments of sorrow and pain, as well as joy and triumph has been our own. Their search for meaning has been our own. It's through this very human level that we're able to connect with the Haibane and share in their emotions. This makes moments like Rakka's monologue inside Kuu's room profoundly moving.

The animation is superb. It's easy to miss in such a quiet setting, but almost every frame reveals subtleties of the Haibane's world. They use a wealth of Earth hues - wonderful greens and browns - that provide a very warm and inviting tone. The animation itself is beautifully fluid as well. But it's probably the town itself that's best rendered. The world of Glie is so well conceived and drawn, giving a real sense of a heartwarming environment. The skies, for example, are almost always drawn like beautiful paintings - often reflecting the seasons. Beyond the animation, the direction and cinematography is superb as well. The ease at which the viewer can get lost in this beautiful world is astounding. ABe mentioned that previous to working on anime he was a Japanese style artist, and his works show it. I think more than anyone currently working in anime, ABe understands what a visually powerful medium anime can be. The music is equally as accomplished; consisting of mostly simple, elegant orchestral pieces. The infusion of music in the series is adeptly applied as well - entering at all the right times and evoking all the right moods.

If there are flaws in the series, they are almost too insignificant to mention. The voice acting is not the best (sub or dub), but the cringe worthy moments are kept to a minimum. The finale perhaps comes too suddenly, making it perhaps less dramatic than it should have been. I also felt some of the characters could've been better developed, and a bit more history and background given about them. I especially wish they would've slowly developed Reki's history, instead of saving it for the end. But all of these are minor grievances, and really not worth even subtracting a single star for.

I've seen Haibane Renmei three times, and each time I'm extremely saddened by the end. Not because the story is sad, but because theirs is a world I'd never want to leave. This series has a great, meditative ""zen"" like quality, and for those in the right frame of mind, you will become thoroughly engrossed in both the lives of its characters and the world in which they exist. You'll smile at their joys and triumphs, and you'll cry at their losses and sorrows. In the end you will be left with a wonderful feeling akin to a spiritual cleansing. The result is nothing short of divine.

DVD REVIEW:

This box set is nice, if unspectacular. The box has a sturdy feel, and the drawings of the characters are very nice. The DVDs themselves come in 4 regular cases, with a collector's book in case one, detailing much of the Haibane's world including characters. There's 3 episodes per disc except for disc 1 that has 4. This low episode per disc allows for a high quality transfer, which is a good thing for my money. The presentation is in 16:9, anamorphic widescreen, but stereo only. The extras are nice but scarce. Including original drawings and an interview with the creator and producer on the last episode. Overall a nice set, but perhaps a bit pricey.

UPDATE ON AVAILABILITY:

In the past few years since I wrote this review, Haibane Renmei has gone Out of Print in the US because of the folding of its distributor. However, there is hope: This set is available at Amazon. UK. But, be warned, these discs are Region 2. For those with region-free DVD players (or for those who have made their player region free) this won't be a problem. For those who don't have a region-free DVD player it's often possible to play region-locked DVDs on your PC. You should certainly check before buying, but this is a series that deserves to be seen without paying the high prices asked by sellers.",1183593600,24,7006,4.691619202603743
2344726,5,B0009ZE9WQ,"I detest spoilers in reviews, and it's difficult to tell someone why this series is so wonderful without offering spoilers or, at the very least, remarks that might color someone's own interpretation of the series.

As someone else mentioned, if you like giant magic pan-dimensional robots blowing each other to bits, this won't be your cup of tea.  Or, perhaps, it won't be your cup of tea if you don't like virtually the opposite of that genre.  While it's not at all what we'd normally label as a ""chick flick,"" this is still not something a male viewer will be able to fully enjoy unless he's really open to his own emotions, because the emotional nature of this piece is probably its defining feature.  Sorry, guys, I know it goes against The Training, but if you're able to get past that, a master work like this will make it worth the effort.  If you can't get past that, this will be lost on you, and that's a genuine shame.

I really don't want to say more about the actual content.  If you do watch this series through to the end, you should then take note of the interview with the creators.  It's quite fascinating and adds something to the experience.  They don't necessarily add anything to the story itself, but they explain some of their goals and why certain things were done certain ways, which really puts a nice finish on the whole thing.",1163635200,5,1358,4.532786885245901
2344727,5,B0009ZE9WQ,"This anime is a very original one in all aspects. It introduces you to a strange old-fashioned society where there are two kinds of people. The two are Humans and Haibane. The Haibane are people with wings and halos that they are supposed to wear to help them stand out.

The characters are very similar looking because of the style in which this anime is drawn but they all have their own flare that sets them apart from the others. The environment and setting are warm and charming. But above all else this movie is sad. Although you watch it and know that you should be sad for certain people you still are. It shows real life emotions very accuratly, in that they are confusing and sometimes come all at once.

In the end it is a very enjoyable anime, It is worth watching more than once, and is good enough that you can get people that ""don't like anime"" to watch and enjoy.

2344728,5,B0009ZE9WQ,"When you watch the first episode or two, you might think that you are in store for a light-hearted comedy like Azumanga Daioh... all the usual cute anime kids are there.  But this is not a comedy.  It gets deeper and darker, and you'll probably find yourself crying by the end.  Although the AnimeNfo description makes it sound like some kind of a Matrix-style science fiction mystery, it really isn't.  There's no Shyamalan-esque twist at the end with some dime-store revelation.  It is much more of a spiritual and emotional journey that artfully plays on timeless themes of salvation, meaning, purpose, love, loss, and trust.  In many ways it is a metaphor for our own experience:  We come into this world from some unknown place, and try to figure out why we're here.  Along the way, we have to say goodbye to people we love, knowing not where they are going, but certain that soon enough we ourselves will be following them, and having never really understood what anything was all about.  And yet, we somehow find a meaning in all the confusion and sadness.  I think that's what this series is about.  And it's both saddening and uplifting, because that's what life is like.",1148774400,112,1180,4.7073170731707314
2344729,4,B0009ZE9WQ,"The story and art of this series are both excellent.  The episodes pass at a good pace, there's good character development and dialogue, and the final ep gives a nice sense of closure.  The music is unremarkable, but it fits with the day-to-day, somewhat mundane atmosphere.  This show can get a little tedious at times because most of the events are so ordinary, but this provides a nice contrast to the more mysterious happenings.  There isn't any real *action* here, so people who are looking for blatant magic, fights, or romance, won't find it.  Although many of the scenes are light and playful, there's no laugh-out-loud comedy.  Even the most intense scenes are pretty subdued.  The show does have a lot of deep emotion, though.  As the series progresses, the relationships between the characters, their backgrounds, and the issues with which they're struggling become clearer.  I won't say the show is really deep, but it's definitely not frivolous.  I especially enjoyed the contrast between the mysterious and the mundane; later on in the series, scenes start pulling away from the humdrum townlife and you pass into the secret, isolated world of the Haibane.  If you like the feel of the first episode, you should probably watch the show all the way through.  There's a stretch of eps early on that are pretty uneventful and a bit monotonous, but new elements are eventually introduced and things do eventually start happening again.

In addition--this is a pretty good show to give as a gift.  It's good for all ages/genders and has nothing objectionable/really stupid.  I can't say 13 year old boys who are crazy about DBZ will like it (in fact, I can say with some confidence that most of them will hate it), but if you've got a quiet, imaginative niece who likes The Secret Garden and stuff, it's probably a good pick.",1145750400,12,1834,4.833333333333333

8071157,5,B0009ZE9WQ,"I picked this one up because I like to follow up on things the makers of Serial Experiments: Lain got involved with. Many of the works make you question your perception of reality, or the way you exist as a being. I'm pleased to say that this series is no exception! In this case it was the work of their common artist, Yoshitoshi ABe, that I followed. His style is very unique and can switch between pleasant and totally unnerving at the drop of a hat! At any rate, though it took me a few years to get around to watching Haibane Renmei, I'm very glad that I did.

In the first place, the soundtrack is spectacular. It may be a bit under emphasized during the series, but its occasionally haunting storybook feel is something that fascinated me long before I saw the actual show. As for Haibane Renmei itself, I have always loved anime that feel like a window into an alternate universe. I feel like I got to know these characters very well. I'm not usually one for 'slice of life' shows, but in this case relatively unremarkable daily events may contain a great deal of character development. Some of the characters wrestle with great existential quandaries. Considering some of the themes that are developed later in the series, I really find it fascinating to speculate about the purpose of the environment and various institutions and relationships at work, as they relate to the personal problems some of the Haibane face. Basically, you get a real feeling of depth here, as if the more you watch and think, the more hidden meaning and symbolism you will unearth.

I also found it easy to relate to the 'depressing' aspects of this series, having had experience with the same sorts of struggles.

The world of Haibane Renmei is a rich one, full of vibrant colors and personalities, and subtly brought to life by an exceptional musical score. If you don't mind making the chronological and emotional investment of placing yourself in the character's shoes, this series has a great deal to offer you. I just finished it and I've immediately started it over again; I highly recommend it, so long as you're not afraid to contemplate some of the more tragic aspects of life.",1285545600,,2175,4.658854166666667

I watched it all, and whenever I discuss it with people, they can't believe I 'didn't get it' or was dissatisfied with the 'not-a-real-ending' ending.  They tell me it's got nothing to do with Judeo-Christian themes, though the characters live in a monastery environment and have angel's wings and are outcasts (sinners).

You can read the wonderful reviews and get the gushing perspective, or can read mine and see why I think this way.  Let's go over the title of this review piece by piece.  First it's Slice-of-Life.  You won't see any action, or romance, and the pacing is slow.  To begin with, I'm not a fan of Slice-of-Life, and I saw all these five star reviews and let someone talk me into watching it.  Stop right here if you also like hot-blooded man anime, because this is about as chick-flick as anime can get.

If you have kids, the kids will like it.  It does function as good babysitting -- it's a pleasant juvenile moralistic fairy tale.  Not so wonderful if you happen to be an adult; at least I didn't find it at the level of Miyazaki or Disney movies, which I always enjoy because they have great dramatic tension.

If you can fall in love with the characters, this won't matter, but if you are like me, and cynically MST3K it in your head because it's boring, thinking 'this is a new fan-pandering direction...  loli-angel-furries' then the first episodes will also fall flat with you.  If you like anime such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aria-the-Animation-Season-1/dp/B001BN4WA4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aria the Animation Season 1</a>, you likely love the show (and you should buy it).

Next we have 'allegorical' and 'fill-in-your-own context.'  Haibane Reimei is set in an idyllic 18th century style location (near a large town) with caring people and tons of daily chores.  It is wholesome, hearty, and flat out boring.  The animation is good, but the story can be a metaphor if you want it to be one.  Whatever ideas you have about life-after-death, you can apply them to this show in some fashion and grow quite attached your personal interpretation.  I've had people foam at the mouth about how their interpretation makes H.R. such an awesome story, and I'm such a terrible guy for not agreeing with them.  I'm not going there, but if you like intellectual anime open to highly subjective philosophy, you'll like this product if you enjoy non-violent slow plotlines.

Finally, what really drove this anime into the 'dislike' category for me was the ending scene.  Yeah, it's an end.  Some will even argue their interpretation means it's a redemptive end.  The type of end it is, well that's not a part of the actual show.  My viewpoint demanded more for me to consider the end a real end, and let's leave it at that.

I didn't like the show.  If you share my tastes, which I have communicated in this review, you won't either.  I concede it is a good production, but I also hate artsy films with high production values, and this anime toed the line between 'boring kid's story' and 'artsy philosophy.'  Make of that what you will, and please don't rage-unhelpful this review because you thought the anime was the greatest thing ever.  There are plenty of glowing reviews, and I know my opinion is in the minority.  Feel free to tell me how my opinion offends you in the comments.  Thanks!",1275436800,8,3417,4.866551126516464
8071159,5,B0009ZE9WQ,"Prior to purchasing this anime, I read a review describing the show as an important experience related to religon and belief. Now, after watching the show, I agree, partially, to that statement.  More so, I believe the show's strong point is its characters and the transition the main character Rakka goes through beginning when you first meet her.

I'm not going to spoil the show, but to encourage everyone to watch this rare gem of an anime.

Now the product itself:

It came in splendid and I love the artwork of the box's exterior. The individual casings also have great artwork themselves and the insert of the art of the show is interesting. The discs were in great shape and the presentation in the title menu is enjoyable.

Again, I highly recommend this show to anyone.",1274745600,,779,4.698529411764706
8071160,4,B0009ZE9WQ,"I went into this series knowing very little about it. I knew that it was emotional, and that Yoshitoshi ABe of Serial Experiments Lain fame was involved. That was enough to get me going. In the first few minutes of the first episode an angel-like woman walks down a hallway smoking a cigarette. I found that imagery delicious, and right then I knew that I had to hang around to see how the series would unfold. I'm positive that not everyone will be as easy to hook as me, and unfortunately for them there are very few moments within the first batch of episodes to really hook you. The first half of the series mostly focuses on the mundane lives of the Haibane (the angel-like girls you see on the box,) which doesn't sound very interesting but it only takes a passing interest into the lives of these creatures (people? some would argue) to keep your attention.

This is a very difficult series to recommend because action is pretty much non-existent, and it can be excruciatingly slow for the impatient. One thing that you should be made aware of going in is that the burning questions that you develop as the series progresses will mostly not be answered. The ones on the surface will, such as what happens to the characters, but the deeper questions such as ""what are the Haibane?"" and ""what is beyond the town?"" will remain unanswered.

I viewed the show in Japanese and thought that they did an excellent job. Unfortunately I looked into this series a little too late and as of the date of this review Haibane Renmei (and every other show that ABe has been involved with) is out of print in the U.S and has been for some time.",1270339200,,1633,4.494949494949495
8071161,5,B0009ZE9WQ,"I hoped to spend a lot more time with this amazing group of Hibane, but even with 13 episodes I felt as if I were with the group for a lot longer. You can read any of the previous reviews for a breakdown of the story, but let me tell you: you cannot be prepared for what takes place during this story.  I do not give away spoilers, but let us say that by episode 10 you think everything is going somewhat well until the final 2 episodes basically slap you senseless.

This is a series that may be viewed by all ages, but to really watch and understand, a more worldly view is required.  The story never really tells what the Haibane really are and why they are in this limbo-like city and who the outsiders are.  The viewer is encouraged to come to their own conclusions.

The story is beautifully written, characters are masterfully portrayed, and even the English dub is excellent.  Artwork is some of the best Japan has produced to date.  What I love about this anime is that even with the sadness, the viewer tends to 'feel good', it is almost inexplicable.  You will find tears in your eyes, yet have a big smile on your face!

Also of note: Please visit wikipedia and check out the Haibane Renmei section, AFTER you watch the series, it might help clear a few questions; then re-watch!

Viewing preference: English dubbed.

Pros: Everything from the art to the acting, characterizations, what is not to love about this story?
Cons: Too short!!!",1204848000,3,1450,4.475285171102661
