3038867,4,B000ZBEOGK,"I liked ""Turok, Son of Stone.""  I'm old enough that I read the original Dell comics when they were released and I thought this movie was true to the original characters and setting while bringing in plenty of amped up action which, I'm told (in the nicely done extra ""Total Turok""), was typical of the Valiant/Acclaim run of the series.  As others have mentioned, some of the production team also worked on the animated Batman, Superman and Justice League series.  It's probably not quite as good as the best of those but it is well done.  If you can, buy it so that it has good sales and they will make a sequel.  That's what I did, even though it was available from Netflix.",1211760000,,676,4.419354838709677
3038868,5,B000ZBEOGK,"I was introduced to Turok back in the 70s when I was a dinosaur obsessed 2nd or 3rd grader. It made quite an impression on me as the two lost Indians made their way into the Lost World with its ""honkers"", which was how they referred to the dinosaurs.

Over the years I have read many of the more updated comics, and was glad to see this DVD take the story back to its roots, and yet ratchet up the violence and savagery of the entire scenario.

I would probably have never been aware of this direct-to-DVD release had it not been for Harry Knowles glowing review over at [...]. He gave the movie high marks and definately sparked my interest. I was not disappointed, and I recommend this movie to fans of Turok, dinosaurs, ""lost world"" type fantasy, or animation fans in general.

I am hoping that Turok and Andar one day make their way to the big screen.",1209686400,,855,4.33125

3038870,5,B000ZBEOGK,This video was a good watch for someone that really enjoyed the character Turok and had a strong following back in the 90's. I know it was the second time this character came out but it was the first time I was exposed to him. But it was really great to see him on video.,1204502400,,271,3.9454545454545453
3038871,3,B000ZBEOGK,"I've always liked the character of Turok.  My dad grew up reading Turok so when Valiant comics released new Turok comics in the early 90's, we followed them.  I had read a lot of good reviews about this movie but I have to say that overall it was just OK.  There are two sides to this movie.
First, we have no-holds bar action and violence.  There are severed heads, blood splattering, and Turok delivering good old fashion beat-downs on enemy warriors and dinosaurs alike.  Turok's design is good and stays true to his comic origins.  His sidekick from the comics, Andar, is there too.  And the designs for the Lost Land the dinosaurs within are all very well done.
On the other hand, the animation reminds me of some of the recent Marvel and DC animated projects.  And while I think that style is good, it just didn't seem to fit with all the violence.  Overall, the voice cast is just ok.  No one, not even Turok, seems to stand out.  The musical score is great at times- very orchestral and moving.  But other times, it's almost synthesized and doesn't fit with the movie.
It's an origin story for Turok and covers all the basics while adding new reasons for him to venture into the lost land.  I just think this more mature movie would have benefited from more mature animation.  But, it is one I recommend anyone give a try because I'm really on the fence about this one.",1204156800,2,1377,4.456
3038872,4,B000ZBEOGK,"I bought this movie on a blind purchase after I read some reviews, and couldn't find it at Blockbuster. I almost never buy movies without watching them first, but I really wanted to see this one badly. And in the end, I'm glad I did, because this is a movie I'll probably want to share with other people I know, rather than just returning it as a rental and forgetting it.

Being a kid of the video game generation, my introduction to Turok was through the Nintendo 64 game ""Turok: Dinosaur Hunter."" I didn't remember much of the story, but I remember spending many a late night with my friends playing ""Turok 2: Seeds of Evil"" on 4-player mode (we would always fight over the Inflater Gun, it was hilarious). I only have a casual interest in comic books, so I was never particularly familiar with the comic incarnations of the character. However, with the snazzy new Turok game out on PS3, my interest in Turok has been rekindled, and after hearing good word of mouth about this DVD, I couldn't resist buying it.

While the new Turok game takes the sci-fi elements of the 80's Turok comics to the next level with a slick re-imagining Turok as a space faring mercenary fighting for his life on a lost world type planet, this movie goes in the opposite direction. This version is more in line with the 50's comics, where Turok is a warrior who is trapped in a lost world with his kin, and it doesn't take long for a villain to show up and recruit some evil Neanderthals to hunt Turok down. The movie has a pretty simple story, but it has some good themes that are clearly tailored towards the adult minds for whom the film was made. It's a respectful revisit to Turok's roots that pays homage to the source, while still maintaining freshness.

The animation is very similar in style to ""Batman: The Animated Series"" and the recent ""Justice League"" series. That makes sense, since one of the movie's three directors was responsible for a lot of episodes of Justice League and ""Superman: The Animated Series,"" and another one also directed ""Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker,"" which is easily on my short list of favorite animated films. The actual quality of the animation is not quite up there with Return of the Joker, but it's still better quality than the vast majority of kids' cartoons you'll see on TV these days. The character designs are good, and during most of the action scenes they move very fluidly. And the movie has plenty of well animated blood-- I would say it's easily on par with ""300"" in terms of balletic violence.

Personally, I think it's really neat to see two versions of Turok out at the same time that while radically different, still both manage to pay respect to different aspects of the character. This movie makes a great companion to the new game, if for no other reason than that.

It also has a pretty good featurette that gives some behind-the-scenes looks at it, and it gave me a much better look at the history of the franchise than I'd been previously aware of. If you are a Turok fan, this is a must-have. And if you're like me, and have spent years pining for American animation studios to make more movies for adults, then you'll want to check this out, because it's a big step in the right direction.",1203379200,14,3242,4.525597269624574
3038873,2,B000ZBEOGK,"Here is the quick review: great concept, great story, amazing direction...disappointing animation.  Had this been animated by a higher caliber studio, (TMS for example, Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker), this would easily be a DVD I would watch over and over...and over.  But as it stands, I can only recommend you rent it if you have some interest in the Turok mythos.

And please please PLEASE don't post asking why I only gave it 2 stars if it had all these things going for it, but only the animation was lacking.  It's called an ""animated film""...if the animation is poor, it has a tendency to drag everything down.

A question for producer Evan Baily: why?  Why in the world would you hire amazing animation directors like Curt Geda and Dan Riba (I cannot comment on Frank Squillance, as I am unfamiliar with his work), and then totally waste it by farming this out to a ""so-so"" animation studio?  Because it's really frustrating to see something that could have been amazing turn out to just be just...""ok"".  It's like you came up with a good melody, hired Hans Zimmer to compose it, then had him conduct this masterpiece with a middle school marching band.  It makes no sense.

Should you choose to do Turok 2 or another Dell concept, don't waste the time and talent of directors like Geda and Riba.  These guys seriously raised the bar on animation direction, and their work deserves to be visualized better than this.",1202515200,8,1429,4.676
3038874,5,B000ZBEOGK,"Don't let the first minute or two fool you - this may start off looking like a Saturday morning cartoon, but this movie quickly disabuses the viewer of the notion with its opening battle.

Remaining faithful to the Gold Key comics, and tossing in a healthy dose of the modern comics' and video games' brutal violence.  I picked this up based on a recommendation, and was not disappointed.  This was a very entertaining movie, with some nice twists.

Heartily recommended.....and I'd stick with the salad if I were you.

3038875,5,B000ZBEOGK,"As a collector of straight to dvd animated films based on comic book characters, I have to say that this is one of the best which will satisfy any Turok fan.  Despite today's generation being mostly familiar with the games, everyone behind this project decided to stay true to the comic to give us an origin story which was very good.  If your looking for a break from today's Saturday morning garbage, well you've come to the right place because plenty of blood is spilt in this more mature/adult film.",1202169600,4,503,4.5777777777777775
3038876,4,B000ZBEOGK,"Turok, first published by Dell Comics in December 1954, came out of the anti-comic book hysteria and featured a Native American character having adventures in wild lands populated by dinosaurs. Over the years, the character has gone through various comic books creators' hands and changed with the times, including a series of popular video games, and now an animated film, Turok: Son of Stone. This motion picture attempts to pay tribute to the original comic book concept blended with an edgier, new Millennium sensibility.

The attention to detail is excellent as the lush, primitive jungle is vividly realized, immersing us in this exotic land. Turok: Son of Stone by no means looks like a cheap, direct-to-video rush job. Obviously, great care and thought went into the making of this animated film. While the look of it is in the style of a lot of contemporary Saturday morning cartoons, this film is definitely not for little kids. The opening action sequence quite vividly and viscerally announces its mature credentials with a bloody battle involving severed hands and slow-motion sprays of blood as Turok wipes out his enemies. This scene sets the tone for a series of violent slaughters and vicious skirmishes with dinosaurs. I haven't seen an animated film this unapologetically bloody and violent since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heavy-Metal-Collector-s-Edition/dp/0767836316/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heavy Metal (Collector's Edition)</a>). If you've grown tired of the G rated wholesomeness of Disney, or the bland nature of cartoons on television, then Turok: Son of Stone is a breath of fresh air.

There is an audio commentary by producer Evan Bailey, supervising director Tad Stones, and directors Curt Geda, Dan Riba, and Frank Squillace. Because they were pressed for time during the production, the filmmakers divided the film into three segments with different directors for each one. They spend time discussing the look of the film and why they made the choices that they did in terms of colour, etc. They speak admiringly of the soundtrack and talk about the story and how it developed.

""Total Turok"" is an excellent primer to the world of Turok, his start as a comic book in the 1950s and how the filmmakers updated yet stayed faithful to the character in this film.",1202083200,25,2342,5.376021798365122
3038887,3,B000ZBEOGK,"There was once a time when the idea of a videogame based on a popular movie series was an exciting prospect, but ask any avid gamer today and they'll tell you that for the most part, movie tie-in games suck. While movie tie-in games are to be expected, what isn't expected is a game getting a tie-in movie, such as the case of Turok: Son of Stone.

While not officially recognized as a tie-in to 2008's Turok released for the PS3, its painfully obvious that this was meant to capitalize on the game's hype, and true to movie tie-in games, it suffers from the same things that makes them awful. Piss poor budget, little connection to the source material (kind of), and seemingly cranked out in a hurry, resulting in a subpar product that pleases few people outside of distributors.

Turok: Son of Stone follows the Gold Key era of stories and follows the origin story of Turok. The story follows a young native american warrior named Tal'Set whom is banished from his from his home after a fight with a rival tribesman named Chichak resulted in bloodshed. Tal'Set remains in isolation for several years until one day he is approached by his nephew, Andar. Andar asks Tal'Set to aid his tribe in an upcoming war, but Tal'Set refuses and sends Andar away. After some consideration, Tal'Set changes his mind and returns home, only to find it in ruin.

Filled with rage, regret and blood lust, Tal'Set and Andar set up to track down and get their revenge on Chichak and pursue him, but not all goes according to plan. The two warriors get lost and find themselves in a strange and hostile world known as the Lost Lands: a mysterious place forgotten by time, inhabited by dangerous prehistoric beasts, brutal cave-dwelling c.h.u.d.s and a tribe of long lost cousins of Tal'Set's own tribe.

It is in this land that Tal'Set uncovers his destiny as Turok: The Son of Stone!

Now that we have the basic plot summary aside, lets talk about what the film did right. The voice acting was very well done and I couldn't think of a better actor to play Tal'Set than Adam Beach. Conflicting sources claim that Tal'Set was the first Turok, and is in fact the second, but as far as origin stories go, this is by far one of the better ones that I've seen in recent years. The violence in this film was surprisingly graphic! You see multiple severed limbs, spilled intestines, cracked necks and lots of other gory effects that will please any gore hound.

But the story and the violence do little if anything to distract you from how cheap the entire thing looks. Normally I can look past awful graphics, or poor visuals in favor of a good story and acting, but in this case, I can't. The entire thing looks as if it were made in flash. The crude, blocky animation and flat, 2D look is very distracting. It's really jarring and difficult to take as seriously as the film tries to be.

While I really enjoyed learning about Tal'Set's history, fans like me wanted to see more man-on-dinosaur carnage. We wanted to see the raptors with robotic implants, the giant temple guardians and the strange demonic creatures, and of course, all of the cool, high-tech gadgetry that we got to play with in the popular FPS games. We could have gotten that if the budget hadn't been a piece of bubble gum and a wad of lint.

I would only recommend this to die-hard fans of the Turok franchise. For anyone else, find an N64 and Turok: Dinosaur Hunter, or buy a few of the omnibuses released by Dark Horse Comics. It'd be money better spent.",1344988800,,3503,4.558028616852146
3038888,3,B000ZBEOGK,"This is one animated movie that had so much potential.  Native Americans fighting dinosaurs, how can you go wrong?  Well they did.

To begin, let me state I am not a Turok expert.  I have played the Nintendo Gamecube game, and died repeatly, also I have never read any of the comics.  As far as other game releases go I have played none.  So I was going into this movie without too many preconceptions, other than the stellar looking cover of the movie.

Let me say, I do own this movie, in fact I watched it online first, and then actually bought it on DVD afterward, for some reason.  I was not dupped into anything.  I will further say this film is NOT terrible and has a few merits going for it.  But...it could have been epic.

Voice casting was the first mistake.  The Native American from 'Joe Dirt', ""Kick'en Wing"", is not the right voice for Turok.  Turok needed a much, much more masculine voice.  The voice did not HAVE to be peformed by a Native American.  In fact most other voices are not.  There are some stellar voice actors out there, there surely was one who would have done this role justice.

Animation wise the film also lacked.  The quality was on par with a television show, a lower budget one at that, with lazy drawers.  They say ""the devil is in the details"", and while I did not expect Anime quality animation I do feel they could have done better.  Tv shows like 'Young Justice' and 'Avatar: The Legend of Korra', show that lower budgets can still deliver great detail infused animation.

Story wise this film does not really hash out much for the viewer.  They simply walk into a tunnel and are suddenly out in dinosaur land.  'Land of the Lost' explains more than this in it's campy intro song.  Why and how can they travel to dinosaur land?  Who knows, and why can't they simply go back through the tunnel to America?

The basic premise going on in the film is that Turok is chasing after a rival tribesman who has kidnapped his late brothers wife.  Turok and his brother's son go chasing after this villian, (who seems to have an infinite supply of black powder and shots), and they all stumble into dinosaur land.  Turok kills some huge monsters, discovers a tribe of Native Americans who have lived in this prehistoric land for a long time, and finally gets justice for his brother and his tribe's slaying.

If you are still interested in this film, I strongly suggest you buy it cheap.  It was online on the PS3 marketplace for a while I believe.  As I said, not the WORST film in the world, but does not stand up to other Anime or animated movies.

Hope this review is helpful.  Perhaps this franchise someday will make it to the silver screen and hopefully get proper treatment.  We don't need another '10,000 BC'.",1335052800,,2751,4.457831325301205
3038889,5,B000ZBEOGK,"i haven read the comic book, but a friend of my father did.
i mostly buy it for 2 reasons,
1.- im a big fan of turok videogames
2.- as a present to my fathers friend.

i really liked the movie its has a very good story, i hope my fathers friend would like it.",1310083200,,259,3.709090909090909
3038890,4,B000ZBEOGK,"Sit back and channel your inner dinosaur hunter. This animated feature starts out on a frolicky note, and there's this fleeting sense that you've maybe stepped into Disney's POCAHANTAS. Moments later though, young Turok enters a berserker state and with his axe begins carving bloody chunks out of his enemies, and everything is as it should be. Featuring okay animation and running at 73 minutes, the story falls more in line with the 1950s series from Dell Comics rather than with Valiant's updating of Turok in the 1990s, meaning that you won't glimpse sequences here of Turok taking out cyber-dinosaurs with explosive arrows. It's strictly old-school.

Exiled from his people sixteen years ago for his violent leanings, fearsome Native American warrior Turok returns home to find his village destroyed and his estranged brother murdered at the hands of Chichak, a ruthless killer from an enemy tribe. With his nephew Andar, Turok races in pursuit of Chichak who had also abducted Andar's beautiful mother Catori. Somewhere along the way, they wander into the Lost Land, a sprawling valley existing outside of time and inhabited by terrifying prehistoric predators. In this savage place, Turok finds a sense of belonging that he'd never felt in the outside world. Here he can cut loose, embrace the darkness within him. In the Lost Land, there are many things that just need killing.

TUROK SON OF STONE is unrated and is most definitely not appropriate for children. Older teenagers and up may get a kick out of it. The story itself is by-the-numbers stuff. But the level of graphic violence is off the chain, and it's what sells the film for me because, as mentioned earlier, the animation itself is just okay. I guess I could be less generous and say that the animation is flat and looks like something from the 1990s. But the action sequences redeem the thing. Turok's battles with various toothy dinosaurs and with cannibalistic cave dwellers are gory and visceral. Turok fights for keeps, man. One poor bastard gets ripped in half, except that we see this moment as shadows on a wall. It's not because the animators thought this too gross to show but because, according to Supervising Director Tad Stones, falling intestines were hard to animate.

Lastly, that hair clip that Catori keeps handing out to her menfolk for good luck just has to be the most unlucky lucky talisman ever.

The DVD's bonus material consists of an audio commentary (by Producer Evan Baily, Supervising Director Tad Stones, and Co-Directors Dan Riba, Curt Geda, and Frank Squillace) and the featurette ""Total Turok"" which dives into Turok's comic book origins from Dell Comics on to Valiant and his transitioning into an animated film (00:22:20 minutes long).",1293840000,2,2743,5.008771929824562
3038891,5,B000ZBEOGK,"THIS MOVIE KICKS @$$!!!

3038896,4,B000ZBEOGK,"Imagine if you crossed ""The Last of the Mohicans"" with ""The Lost World."" That's pretty much what you get in this direct-to-DVD animated feature: native Americans, wall-to-wall dinosaurs, and non-stop action.

If you grew up watching Saturday morning action/adventure cartoons (and let's face it, who didn't?), this is a great way of revisiting them but in a more adult context. More blood flows here than in ""Saving Private Ryan"", but it's very stylized, so it's unlikely to traumatize anyone over the age of about 13. (Let me put it this way, if this had been around back in the '80s when I was 13, I would have LOVED it, but I probably would've had to hide it from my parents, who wouldn't have approved.) It's violent but in a cool, samurai-film kind of way. Personally, I thought it was a great idea to combine retro-style 2D animation with modern-day bloodletting. This is no cutesy Disney film, this is traditional-style cel animation for grownups, with no ironic pop-culture references in sight. Pixar should start experimenting with dark animated films like this, and I hope their upcoming John Carter film (films?) will be in the same vein. I love Pixar movies but I feel they've gone to the ""cute talking animals/inanimate objects"" well too many times. They should start using their awesome 3D animation skills to produce some slightly darker, edgier material rather than just variations on ""Toy Story"", ""Nemo"", ""Monsters Inc"" etc, something like ""Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within"" but, well, not lame.

Anyway, back to Turok. The voice cast is good (although the dliaogue delivery is a bit stilted at times), the artwork is quite beautiful at times, and the action comes thick and fast, with lots of surprises and big thundering set-pieces. I would LOVE to see this as a live-action feature. It'd be a summer blockbuster for sure. Adam Beach could reprise his role as Turok in live-action perhaps.

I've never read the Turok comic books, so I'm not sure how this compares to them, but I loved it all the same. Action, adventure, exotic scenery, dinosaurs of all descriptions ... made me feel 13 all over again!",1212364800,,2122,4.888888888888889

It's an origin story for Turok and covers all the basics while adding new reasons for him to venture into the lost land.  I just think this more mature movie would have benefited from more mature animation.  But, it is one I recommend anyone give a try because I'm really on the fence about this one.",1204156800,2,1377,4.456
3273369,4,B000ZBEOGK,"I bought this movie on a blind purchase after I read some reviews, and couldn't find it at Blockbuster. I almost never buy movies without watching them first, but I really wanted to see this one badly. And in the end, I'm glad I did, because this is a movie I'll probably want to share with other people I know, rather than just returning it as a rental and forgetting it.

Being a kid of the video game generation, my introduction to Turok was through the Nintendo 64 game ""Turok: Dinosaur Hunter."" I didn't remember much of the story, but I remember spending many a late night with my friends playing ""Turok 2: Seeds of Evil"" on 4-player mode (we would always fight over the Inflater Gun, it was hilarious). I only have a casual interest in comic books, so I was never particularly familiar with the comic incarnations of the character. However, with the snazzy new Turok game out on PS3, my interest in Turok has been rekindled, and after hearing good word of mouth about this DVD, I couldn't resist buying it.

While the new Turok game takes the sci-fi elements of the 80's Turok comics to the next level with a slick re-imagining Turok as a space faring mercenary fighting for his life on a lost world type planet, this movie goes in the opposite direction. This version is more in line with the 50's comics, where Turok is a warrior who is trapped in a lost world with his kin, and it doesn't take long for a villain to show up and recruit some evil Neanderthals to hunt Turok down. The movie has a pretty simple story, but it has some good themes that are clearly tailored towards the adult minds for whom the film was made. It's a respectful revisit to Turok's roots that pays homage to the source, while still maintaining freshness.

The animation is very similar in style to ""Batman: The Animated Series"" and the recent ""Justice League"" series. That makes sense, since one of the movie's three directors was responsible for a lot of episodes of Justice League and ""Superman: The Animated Series,"" and another one also directed ""Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker,"" which is easily on my short list of favorite animated films. The actual quality of the animation is not quite up there with Return of the Joker, but it's still better quality than the vast majority of kids' cartoons you'll see on TV these days. The character designs are good, and during most of the action scenes they move very fluidly. And the movie has plenty of well animated blood-- I would say it's easily on par with ""300"" in terms of balletic violence.

Personally, I think it's really neat to see two versions of Turok out at the same time that while radically different, still both manage to pay respect to different aspects of the character. This movie makes a great companion to the new game, if for no other reason than that.

It also has a pretty good featurette that gives some behind-the-scenes looks at it, and it gave me a much better look at the history of the franchise than I'd been previously aware of. If you are a Turok fan, this is a must-have. And if you're like me, and have spent years pining for American animation studios to make more movies for adults, then you'll want to check this out, because it's a big step in the right direction.",1203379200,14,3242,4.525597269624574
3273370,2,B000ZBEOGK,"Here is the quick review: great concept, great story, amazing direction...disappointing animation.  Had this been animated by a higher caliber studio, (TMS for example, Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker), this would easily be a DVD I would watch over and over...and over.  But as it stands, I can only recommend you rent it if you have some interest in the Turok mythos.

And please please PLEASE don't post asking why I only gave it 2 stars if it had all these things going for it, but only the animation was lacking.  It's called an ""animated film""...if the animation is poor, it has a tendency to drag everything down.

A question for producer Evan Baily: why?  Why in the world would you hire amazing animation directors like Curt Geda and Dan Riba (I cannot comment on Frank Squillance, as I am unfamiliar with his work), and then totally waste it by farming this out to a ""so-so"" animation studio?  Because it's really frustrating to see something that could have been amazing turn out to just be just...""ok"".  It's like you came up with a good melody, hired Hans Zimmer to compose it, then had him conduct this masterpiece with a middle school marching band.  It makes no sense.

Should you choose to do Turok 2 or another Dell concept, don't waste the time and talent of directors like Geda and Riba.  These guys seriously raised the bar on animation direction, and their work deserves to be visualized better than this.",1202515200,8,1429,4.676

Despite today's generation being mostly familiar with the games, everyone behind this project decided to stay true to the comic to give us an origin story which was very good.  If your looking for a break from today's Saturday morning garbage, well you've come to the right place because plenty of blood is spilt in this more mature/adult film.",1202169600,4,503,4.5777777777777775
3273373,4,B000ZBEOGK,"Turok, first published by Dell Comics in December 1954, came out of the anti-comic book hysteria and featured a Native American character having adventures in wild lands populated by dinosaurs. Over the years, the character has gone through various comic books creators' hands and changed with the times, including a series of popular video games, and now an animated film, Turok: Son of Stone. This motion picture attempts to pay tribute to the original comic book concept blended with an edgier, new Millennium sensibility.

The attention to detail is excellent as the lush, primitive jungle is vividly realized, immersing us in this exotic land. Turok: Son of Stone by no means looks like a cheap, direct-to-video rush job. Obviously, great care and thought went into the making of this animated film. While the look of it is in the style of a lot of contemporary Saturday morning cartoons, this film is definitely not for little kids. The opening action sequence quite vividly and viscerally announces its mature credentials with a bloody battle involving severed hands and slow-motion sprays of blood as Turok wipes out his enemies. This scene sets the tone for a series of violent slaughters and vicious skirmishes with dinosaurs. I haven't seen an animated film this unapologetically bloody and violent since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heavy-Metal-Collector-s-Edition/dp/0767836316/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heavy Metal (Collector's Edition)</a>). If you've grown tired of the G rated wholesomeness of Disney, or the bland nature of cartoons on television, then Turok: Son of Stone is a breath of fresh air.

There is an audio commentary by producer Evan Bailey, supervising director Tad Stones, and directors Curt Geda, Dan Riba, and Frank Squillace. Because they were pressed for time during the production, the filmmakers divided the film into three segments with different directors for each one. They spend time discussing the look of the film and why they made the choices that they did in terms of colour, etc. They speak admiringly of the soundtrack and talk about the story and how it developed.

""Total Turok"" is an excellent primer to the world of Turok, his start as a comic book in the 1950s and how the filmmakers updated yet stayed faithful to the character in this film.",1202083200,25,2342,5.376021798365122
3273384,3,B000ZBEOGK,"There was once a time when the idea of a videogame based on a popular movie series was an exciting prospect, but ask any avid gamer today and they'll tell you that for the most part, movie tie-in games suck. While movie tie-in games are to be expected, what isn't expected is a game getting a tie-in movie, such as the case of Turok: Son of Stone.

While not officially recognized as a tie-in to 2008's Turok released for the PS3, its painfully obvious that this was meant to capitalize on the game's hype, and true to movie tie-in games, it suffers from the same things that makes them awful. Piss poor budget, little connection to the source material (kind of), and seemingly cranked out in a hurry, resulting in a subpar product that pleases few people outside of distributors.

Turok: Son of Stone follows the Gold Key era of stories and follows the origin story of Turok. The story follows a young native american warrior named Tal'Set whom is banished from his from his home after a fight with a rival tribesman named Chichak resulted in bloodshed. Tal'Set remains in isolation for several years until one day he is approached by his nephew, Andar. Andar asks Tal'Set to aid his tribe in an upcoming war, but Tal'Set refuses and sends Andar away. After some consideration, Tal'Set changes his mind and returns home, only to find it in ruin.

Filled with rage, regret and blood lust, Tal'Set and Andar set up to track down and get their revenge on Chichak and pursue him, but not all goes according to plan. The two warriors get lost and find themselves in a strange and hostile world known as the Lost Lands: a mysterious place forgotten by time, inhabited by dangerous prehistoric beasts, brutal cave-dwelling c.h.u.d.s and a tribe of long lost cousins of Tal'Set's own tribe.

It is in this land that Tal'Set uncovers his destiny as Turok: The Son of Stone!

Now that we have the basic plot summary aside, lets talk about what the film did right. The voice acting was very well done and I couldn't think of a better actor to play Tal'Set than Adam Beach. Conflicting sources claim that Tal'Set was the first Turok, and is in fact the second, but as far as origin stories go, this is by far one of the better ones that I've seen in recent years. The violence in this film was surprisingly graphic! You see multiple severed limbs, spilled intestines, cracked necks and lots of other gory effects that will please any gore hound.

But the story and the violence do little if anything to distract you from how cheap the entire thing looks. Normally I can look past awful graphics, or poor visuals in favor of a good story and acting, but in this case, I can't. The entire thing looks as if it were made in flash. The crude, blocky animation and flat, 2D look is very distracting. It's really jarring and difficult to take as seriously as the film tries to be.

While I really enjoyed learning about Tal'Set's history, fans like me wanted to see more man-on-dinosaur carnage. We wanted to see the raptors with robotic implants, the giant temple guardians and the strange demonic creatures, and of course, all of the cool, high-tech gadgetry that we got to play with in the popular FPS games. We could have gotten that if the budget hadn't been a piece of bubble gum and a wad of lint.

I would only recommend this to die-hard fans of the Turok franchise. For anyone else, find an N64 and Turok: Dinosaur Hunter, or buy a few of the omnibuses released by Dark Horse Comics. It'd be money better spent.",1344988800,,3503,4.558028616852146
3273385,3,B000ZBEOGK,"This is one animated movie that had so much potential.  Native Americans fighting dinosaurs, how can you go wrong?  Well they did.

To begin, let me state I am not a Turok expert.  I have played the Nintendo Gamecube game, and died repeatly, also I have never read any of the comics.  As far as other game releases go I have played none.  So I was going into this movie without too many preconceptions, other than the stellar looking cover of the movie.

Let me say, I do own this movie, in fact I watched it online first, and then actually bought it on DVD afterward, for some reason.  I was not dupped into anything.  I will further say this film is NOT terrible and has a few merits going for it.  But...it could have been epic.

Voice casting was the first mistake.  The Native American from 'Joe Dirt', ""Kick'en Wing"", is not the right voice for Turok.  Turok needed a much, much more masculine voice.  The voice did not HAVE to be peformed by a Native American.  In fact most other voices are not.  There are some stellar voice actors out there, there surely was one who would have done this role justice.

Animation wise the film also lacked.  The quality was on par with a television show, a lower budget one at that, with lazy drawers.  They say ""the devil is in the details"", and while I did not expect Anime quality animation I do feel they could have done better.  Tv shows like 'Young Justice' and 'Avatar: The Legend of Korra', show that lower budgets can still deliver great detail infused animation.

Story wise this film does not really hash out much for the viewer.  They simply walk into a tunnel and are suddenly out in dinosaur land.  'Land of the Lost' explains more than this in it's campy intro song.  Why and how can they travel to dinosaur land?  Who knows, and why can't they simply go back through the tunnel to America?

The basic premise going on in the film is that Turok is chasing after a rival tribesman who has kidnapped his late brothers wife.  Turok and his brother's son go chasing after this villian, (who seems to have an infinite supply of black powder and shots), and they all stumble into dinosaur land.  Turok kills some huge monsters, discovers a tribe of Native Americans who have lived in this prehistoric land for a long time, and finally gets justice for his brother and his tribe's slaying.

If you are still interested in this film, I strongly suggest you buy it cheap.  It was online on the PS3 marketplace for a while I believe.  As I said, not the WORST film in the world, but does not stand up to other Anime or animated movies.

Hope this review is helpful.  Perhaps this franchise someday will make it to the silver screen and hopefully get proper treatment.  We don't need another '10,000 BC'.",1335052800,,2751,4.457831325301205

3273387,4,B000ZBEOGK,"Sit back and channel your inner dinosaur hunter. This animated feature starts out on a frolicky note, and there's this fleeting sense that you've maybe stepped into Disney's POCAHANTAS. Moments later though, young Turok enters a berserker state and with his axe begins carving bloody chunks out of his enemies, and everything is as it should be. Featuring okay animation and running at 73 minutes, the story falls more in line with the 1950s series from Dell Comics rather than with Valiant's updating of Turok in the 1990s, meaning that you won't glimpse sequences here of Turok taking out cyber-dinosaurs with explosive arrows. It's strictly old-school.

Exiled from his people sixteen years ago for his violent leanings, fearsome Native American warrior Turok returns home to find his village destroyed and his estranged brother murdered at the hands of Chichak, a ruthless killer from an enemy tribe. With his nephew Andar, Turok races in pursuit of Chichak who had also abducted Andar's beautiful mother Catori. Somewhere along the way, they wander into the Lost Land, a sprawling valley existing outside of time and inhabited by terrifying prehistoric predators. In this savage place, Turok finds a sense of belonging that he'd never felt in the outside world. Here he can cut loose, embrace the darkness within him. In the Lost Land, there are many things that just need killing.

TUROK SON OF STONE is unrated and is most definitely not appropriate for children. Older teenagers and up may get a kick out of it. The story itself is by-the-numbers stuff. But the level of graphic violence is off the chain, and it's what sells the film for me because, as mentioned earlier, the animation itself is just okay. I guess I could be less generous and say that the animation is flat and looks like something from the 1990s. But the action sequences redeem the thing. Turok's battles with various toothy dinosaurs and with cannibalistic cave dwellers are gory and visceral. Turok fights for keeps, man. One poor bastard gets ripped in half, except that we see this moment as shadows on a wall. It's not because the animators thought this too gross to show but because, according to Supervising Director Tad Stones, falling intestines were hard to animate.

Lastly, that hair clip that Catori keeps handing out to her menfolk for good luck just has to be the most unlucky lucky talisman ever.

The DVD's bonus material consists of an audio commentary (by Producer Evan Baily, Supervising Director Tad Stones, and Co-Directors Dan Riba, Curt Geda, and Frank Squillace) and the featurette ""Total Turok"" which dives into Turok's comic book origins from Dell Comics on to Valiant and his transitioning into an animated film (00:22:20 minutes long).",1293840000,2,2743,5.008771929824562

3273393,4,B000ZBEOGK,"Imagine if you crossed ""The Last of the Mohicans"" with ""The Lost World."" That's pretty much what you get in this direct-to-DVD animated feature: native Americans, wall-to-wall dinosaurs, and non-stop action.

If you grew up watching Saturday morning action/adventure cartoons (and let's face it, who didn't?), this is a great way of revisiting them but in a more adult context. More blood flows here than in ""Saving Private Ryan"", but it's very stylized, so it's unlikely to traumatize anyone over the age of about 13. (Let me put it this way, if this had been around back in the '80s when I was 13, I would have LOVED it, but I probably would've had to hide it from my parents, who wouldn't have approved.) It's violent but in a cool, samurai-film kind of way. Personally, I thought it was a great idea to combine retro-style 2D animation with modern-day bloodletting. This is no cutesy Disney film, this is traditional-style cel animation for grownups, with no ironic pop-culture references in sight. Pixar should start experimenting with dark animated films like this, and I hope their upcoming John Carter film (films?) will be in the same vein. I love Pixar movies but I feel they've gone to the ""cute talking animals/inanimate objects"" well too many times. They should start using their awesome 3D animation skills to produce some slightly darker, edgier material rather than just variations on ""Toy Story"", ""Nemo"", ""Monsters Inc"" etc, something like ""Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within"" but, well, not lame.

Anyway, back to Turok. The voice cast is good (although the dliaogue delivery is a bit stilted at times), the artwork is quite beautiful at times, and the action comes thick and fast, with lots of surprises and big thundering set-pieces. I would LOVE to see this as a live-action feature. It'd be a summer blockbuster for sure. Adam Beach could reprise his role as Turok in live-action perhaps.
