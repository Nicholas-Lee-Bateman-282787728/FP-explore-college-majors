8615782,5,B00FHASF3M,"I love this drama.  I first came across this drama on an online site.  I loved it so much that I knew that I had to have it for my collection. Lee Jong Suk did an excellent job portraying his role and he is just gorgeous.  I'm totally in love with him.

The seller I bought it from sent my dvd quickly.  I wasn't expecting this until the end of the month, but within days of the package showing ""Shipped,"" I was surprised to see it in the mail.

The subtitles were pretty close to the site that I was watching this from.  There were a couple of typos but it didn't detract from understanding the subtitle.  My only compliant is that at the bottom of the screen is some kind of news ticker in Korean (which I can't read), detracts from the pleasure that I get from watching the drama.  That news ticker appears at least 2 to 4 times per episode.  I wonder if the more expensive one also has this?  Oh well, I'm still very happy with the drama.",1413244800,,942,4.1208791208791204

8615784,5,B00FHASF3M,"How not to let revenge ruin your life, told in the most interesting way ever.  And the characters evolve in such a satisfying way.  I would recommend this drama highly b/c it shows the humanity in even the most despicable characters, while not excusing the choices they made.  And it reminds the viewer that justice is not easy but essential for a just society.",1388534400,3,361,4.609375
