8466873,4,B005DISXXA,"This is primarily a ground war film involving training and operations of the Red Beret paratroopers in Britain during World War 2.  The film mentions the Lend Lease agreement of Sept. 1940, shows the Bruneval Raid of Feb. 1942, and the taking of the Bone airfield, Tunisia Nov. 1942.

There are shots of a barrage balloon with a larger basket for parachute training jumps, converted Wellingtons for training and ops that have postwar markings,  C-47's with a mix of British and USAF postwar markings, and even two civilian DC-3s with undersize wartime markings.  There is a glimpse of what maybe a Valetta tail used for door exiting shots at one point, and the nose and engine of a  Beaufighter sitting on the airfield to be captured.

One odd thing is that Stanley Baker has nearly all of his lines as an instructor dubbed by another actor.  Perhaps his voice wasn't considered proper and commanding enough.",1422921600,,908,4.819354838709677
8466874,5,B005DISXXA,"This 1953 British war film, based on true events, is a most EXCELLENT thing and a GREAT tribute to WWII soldiers of Parachute Regiment. I discovered it only recently and I was VERY IMPRESSED! Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

WARNING! This is a Region 2 PAL DVD. It will NOT play on US+Canada Region 1 NTSC equipment!

If the main hero of the film, Private Steve ""Canada"" MacKendrick (Alan Ladd) is a fictitious character, the main SECONDARY character, Major John Snow (Leo Glenn, excellent!) REALLY existed and this film is actually largely based on REAL exploits of soldiers he commanded - albeit in the real life his name was John Dutton Frost. Therefore, before reviewing the film itself, it is useful to write something about the real John Frost. WARNING: some SPOILERS AHEAD.

1. Major General John Dutton Frost, CB, DSO & Bar, MC, DL (1912-1993)

Born in a military family, young John Frost joined the army in 1932 after graduating from Sandhurst. After serving with Scottish Rifles and a period of service in Iraq (1938-1941) he then volunteered to join the newly created Parachute Regiment.

Promoted to major in 1942 he was the officer in command during the operation ""Biting"" (27 February 1942), leading 120 paratroopers into landing at Bruneval in occupied France. The target of the attack was a German radar station - after capturing it, paratroopers dismantled it and carried away the most essential parts, to provide intelligence necessary in electronic warfare. After losing three killed and seven wounded in fighting, the whole force was successfully evacuated by Royal Navy. Frost was awarded the Military Cross for this action and later that year he was promoted to lieutenant-colonel.

During allied landing in North Africa (Operation ""Torch"") Frost commanded during another high risk mission, when on 3 December 1942 he led the 2nd Battalion of paratroopers in an attack against a German airfield at Depienne, near Tunis. His orders were to seize the airfield and hold until relieved by a British armoured column. However (contrary to what is shown in the film), the airfield was found abandoned as Germans transferred their planes and personnel somewhere else just before the attack - on another hand there were many Wehrmacht's units around and they vigorously counter-attacked. With the relief column being nowhere in sight Frost's men had to abandon the airfield and operate a fighting 50 miles retreat to reach allied lines - losing 16 officers and 250 men in the process...

The film ENDS AT THAT MOMENT. Frost 2nd Battalion continued fighting in Tunisia campaign, as regular infantry. Soon after Frost again commanded the 2nd Battalion in an airborne attack of Sicily (Operation ""Husky"") and then during the landing on Italian peninsula, at Taranto (this time his unit arrived by sea). Although promoted soon after Italy campaign to full colonel, he didn't participate in landing in Normandy - I couldn't find the reason why, but my guess is that with his experience he was temporarily affected to planning duties at headquarters.

He was however given a very important assignment in operation ""Market-Garden"" - again at the head of 2nd Battalion, he was to spearhead the attack of the whole 1th Airborne Division against the bridges on Rhine at Arnhem. His target was the main road bridge. Facing a German opposition much stronger than expected, he managed to seize the bridgehead on the eastern bank of Rhine near their target - but his lightly armed men were unable to capture the other end of the bridge. The 2nd Battalion was then cut from the rest of the division and had to face a much stronger enemy, supported by numerous tanks. After four days of fight, with only one hundred valid men remaining (out of the initial 745) and without any perspective of relief Frost (himself wounded) decided to surrender, in order to save the lives of his last soldiers. He spend the rest of war as closely watched but greatly honoured prisoner of war, in Spangenberg Castle Oflag and later, due to his deteriorating health, in a military hospital.

Colonel Frost returned to active duty after being freed from captivity by US troops in March 1945 and ultimately reached the rank of Major General. He retired in 1968.

Because of his exploits, Frost became a real living legend. ""Red Beret"" was not the last film in which John Frost is depicted - in ""One bridge too far"" he was played by Anthony Hopkins. In 1978 the main road bridge on Rhine at Arnhem was renamed ""John Frost Bridge"".

2. The film

As mentioned above, the main hero of the film is Private Steve MacKendrick (Alan Ladd), a US born Canadian volunteer and therefore called by everybody ""Canada"" - and occasionally also ""Yank""... From the first minute of the film it is clear that, although he denies it, he has some previous military experience and without any doubt he has also some painful secrets in his past - but I will not say anything more here.

At one moment ""Canada"" meets a young girl who I believe is a WAAF (meaning a member of Women's Auxiliary Air Force), Penny Gardner (Susan Stephen, delicious!). Penny is one of parachute riggers affected to the base where Parachute Regiment volunteers are being trained. The relations between those two will quickly take a form of a grumpy dog/spitting cat fascination dance...)))

As already mentioned, his commanding officer, John Snow, also plays a very important role in this film. Experienced actor Leo Glenn, who was himself a veteran of World War II (he finished the war as Lieutenant Colonel of artillery) played him with great skill.

Another important character is Regimental Sergeant Major Cameron, played splendidly by Harry Andrews, an actor who was going to play a lot more in the years to come - he would be Hector in ""Helen of Troy"", Stubb in ""Moby Dick"", Sergeant Payne in ""A hill in Korea"", Pugh in ""Ice cold in Alex"" and many, many other characters, including King Darius, Saint Peter, Tolstoy and even one of Elders of planet Krypton. Clearly, once you got the art of Regimental Sergeant Majoring covered, you can become anything you want...)))

Yet another important, although slightly less present on screen character, is sergeant Breton, played by Stanley Baker, an actor who also was in the beginnings of a very interesting career (""Zulu"", ""Knights of the round table"", ""The guns of Navarone"", ""Sodom and Gomorrah"", ""Sands of Kalahari""). In this film his character is subaltern to the one played by Harry Andrews. The two sergeants probably didn't get along well, because in ""Helen of Troy"" Stanley Baker, playing Achilles, mercilessly killed Hector, played by Harry Andrews...))) However this attack against higher ranking fellow sergeant didn't go unpunished, as in ""A hill in Korea"" he was demoted to corporal - and placed again under the order of a sergeant played by Harry Andrews... Karma clearly is a bitch...)))

I really liked the way the training of volunteers and the building of a completely new unit were shown. The uneasy cross-civilizational war time romance was also a pleasure to watch. There is no shortage of tragedy - after all it is a war movie - but humour was not forgotten. The horrible cultural shock which occurs when in 1942 Americans arrive in numbers to United Kingdom is a particularly delicious moment. The large place given to the precious contribution of female parachute riggers, whose small hands and nimble fingers were particularly adapted for this crucially important task, is also an asset.

I also appreciated that non-Commonwealth foreign volunteers serving in Parachute Regiment were not forgotten. Being Polish myself I of course rooted particularly for Private Polecki, the knife throwing Polish guy serving in the same platoon as ""Canada"". There were indeed some Polish volunteers amongst the first soldiers of Parachute Regiment, even if they were quickly reassigned to the Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade of general Sosabowski (also formed in 1941). I was particularly pleased by the fact that the name of this guy was NOT Kowalski. No, seriously, once you look into the subject, you will realise that virtually every time when in a film there is a Polish guy, well from ""The streetcar named desire"" through ""Day of the Jackal"", ""Vanishing point"", ""Blade Runner"", ""Hot Shots"" and all the way to the ""Penguins of Madagascar"" and ""Gran Torino"", his name is almost always frigging Kowalski! Well, this film gets from me an extra praise for its creativity and general nonKowalskishness...

LITTLE SPOILER WARNING HERE. Sorry for spending so much time and effort on the one Polish guy, who after all has only like 90 seconds of screen time, but I cannot help - tribal solidarity is a holy duty. So, to continue on Private Polecki, I really appreciated also the fact that he actually makes it alive and well until the final credits. It is a quite rare, in fact quasi miraculous occurrence, as Polish guys are usually killed amongst the very first in most war movies. It works even in the future as in ""Aliens"" Private Wierzbowski dies third, barely five seconds after Crowe and Frost... OK, that fulfils my Polish tribal obligations.

The one thing I found slightly weaker in this film was the action scenes in the second operation (in Tunisia), as Germans really act like total idiots in this battle and die stupidly by bushels. Let's not even talk about the use of a captured Panzershreck (German copy of bazooka) to clear a minefield (sic!) - when in the same time enemy armoured cars have to be engaged by hand grenades... Also the German officer who gives his cornered enemies some time to surrender (which of course allows them to better plot their escape) is really, really such a stupid unnecessary clich - I was really surprised that he was not holding a dachshund on a leash and eating sauerkraut when waiting for the British to ""zurrender""...

Other than the film itself, it must be also said, that the picture on the cover of DVD was also an unfortunate choice as Alan Ladd looks on it very differently from how he appears in the film - in fact he looks as if he was 50 years old (he was actually 40 when he played in ""Red Beret"", but looked younger).

But those little criticisms notwithstanding, I liked this film A LOT. It is really a good war movie, a good war time romance and a GREAT tribute to all those men and women of the Great Generation who by their efforts and sacrifices defeated the Axis powers. I will keep this film for another viewing in the future. A film to buy absolutely! ENJOY!",1417132800,,10551,4.88268156424581
8466875,5,B005DISXXA,"Great Film!  I just finished watching it on cable.  Dana Andrews is great as the trainee who is somewhat more skilled than his instructors are aware of. He joins the Canadian Army, and goes to Britain to fight after Dunkirk.  There are a lot of great scenes in this movie.  But one of my favorites is the 'bar fight'.  McKendrick finds himself having defend American honor.  The donnybrook gets started, and someone switches the radio over to a station that just happens to be playing 'music to bar brawl' by.  I thought that was hilarious!",1416268800,,540,4.621052631578947

8466877,4,B005DISXXA,"Very good movie, I am a fan of Alan Ladd it was good to see it from the view of the British",1395273600,,91,3.1818181818181817
8466878,4,B005DISXXA,"The background to the story is the formation of the famous Parachute Regiment early in WW2 and is taken from book ""The Red Beret"" by Hilary St. George Saunders published in 1950. The lead role originally intended for Richard Todd who turned it down because he considered it too far-fetched. The script was then rewritten to accommodate Alan Ladd who had just signed a three-picture deal in England with Warwick Film Productions. The three films being THE RED BERET (1953), HELL BELOW ZERO (1954) and THE BLACK KNIGHT (1954) all released through Columbia Pictures.

There was some criticism at the time in Britain  having an American in the leading role, but remember Ladd was massively popular here in those days and we shouldn't forget his mother was English having been born and raised in Chester; so at least he could claim to be half English, just as Winston Churchill could be said to be half American!

A mystery American with a past Steve MacKendrick (Alan Ladd), nicknamed ""Canada"" because that is where he claims he is from, volunteers for the British Army's paratroopers school where they are put through a rigorous training regime overseen by Regimental Sergeant Major Cameron (Harry Andrews). There first operation was an attack on a German radar installation on the cliff top in Northern France to capture vital equipment followed by a rescue from the sea shore by the Royal Navy!

Back at base Steve visits a wounded comrade in hospital. MacKendrick is recognised by a visiting American airman. During the following weekend he ""spills the beans"" about his past to his girl friend Penny Gardner (Susan Stephen). Next mission is to destroy a German held airfield in North Africa where after the raid they become trapped in a minefield only managing to escape when MacKendrick comes up with an improbable plan using a 3.5 rocket launcher (Bazooka) to cut a path through the minefield, allowing them to join up with the 1st Army which had landed near to Algiers and was heading for Tunis.

Now in the Public Domain the colour print seems to have survived pretty well, there is a fine musical score an excellent supporting cast including Leo Genn  as Major Snow and in particularly  Harry Andrews who plays a very believable RSM (Regimental Sergeant Major) and yes they were like that; indeed all the training scenes in the film were very well done! The film was directed by Terrance Young who later directed the early BOND Films.

After the film was released Winston Churchill sent Alan Ladd a note commending his performance in THE RED BERET released in America as PARATROOPER. About the same time Ladd was voted the world's most popular actor by the British public! The RED BERET was filmed at Shepperton Studios, RAF Abingdon Parachute School and the North Africa scenes in Trawsfynydd, Gwynedd, North Wales which sadly didn't look much like North Africa to me or anyone else I suspect, otherwise very good considering the economic climate in Britain at the time of filming.

8466879,1,B005DISXXA,"We were very excited to find it let alone, receive it but, it would not play in the ""Insigna"" blu ray/dvd player.  Even cleaned the player and the disk.  Would not even load...never got to see it.",1372118400,,196,4.27027027027027
8466880,4,B005DISXXA,"Alan Ladd is a Canadian volunteer (though later revealed to be an American), in the British army. He is taciturn and clearly harbouring something. This is the army after Dunkirk; rebuilding and creating something new - in this case, the Parachute Regiment. Leo Genn is the anchor to it all, as the lieutenant colonel. Harry Andrews blusters his way as the splendidly festooned Scottish regimental sergeant major (the apex of non-commissioned officers in the army). There is psychology in this film; the colonel's attempt to understand the motives behind the mysterious volunteer. The first action-based parachute drop into northern France is spectacular, in a realistic way. The false element is when the colonel and occasionally others, `pull the pin' from their hand grenades with their teeth. It's impossible, certainly with normal teeth! Love blossoms. The psychological question is answered in the closing action, in North Africa. This is a thoughtful film in which a man's demons are slowly put to rest. It is also an early product of Cubby Broccoli and Terence Young, who were to collaborate later on some of the early Bond movies. There is certainly above average camera work. It's a well-crafted film. The fact that I remember seeing it the first time as a five-year old, sneaking into the British army barracks cinema in Bielefeld, is another matter entirely.",1315440000,4,1369,5.143497757847534
