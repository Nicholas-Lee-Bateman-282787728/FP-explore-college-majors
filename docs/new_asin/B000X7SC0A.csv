8227080,4,B000X7SC0A,"This delightful comedy will come as quite a surprise to fans of director William Castle, who is best known for his subsequent, very popular suspense films, including, ""The Tingler"" and ""House on Haunted Hill."" The hero, Eddie Tayloe, is played by then-26-years-old Guy Madison, a Hollywood hunk of the era who is most famous for playing Wild Bill Hickok on TV in the 1950's. Eddie inherits $6000, equivalent to $84,000 in today's dollars, from his grandfather. This legacy frees him to leave a boring job at a Texas newspaper to pursue his big dream of becoming a successful playwright in New York. On his journey to the big city, he picks up a beautiful, young hitchhiker named Perry Dunklin, played by Diana Lynn, here age 22. Perry is also running away from a dead-end job, hers at a gas station. They part ways once they arrive in New York, and, separately, they have little luck achieving their goals. Eddie writes a play, but can't sell it, and Perry struggles to find a decent job, let alone an inspiring one. Then fortunate chance, involving an incident with a little-old-lady pickpocket named Mandy (played by Florence Bates), brings them together again.

While Guy Madison is handsome and Diana Lynn is very cute, like most fish-out-of-water, romantic comedies--of the past or the present--this is not meant to be a steamy romance. It is definitely G-rated, with the entertainment arising from the zany relationships the two leads have with each other and various kooky people the two run into in New York. These eccentrics are ably played by some of the best character actors of the era, including: Margaret Hamilton, who is famed for her role as the Wicked Witch in the Wizard of Oz of 1939; William Frawley, who is best known for his role as Fred in the I Love Lucy TV series of the 1950s; Jesse White, who is most remembered for his 21-year stint as the ""Maytag Repair Man"" in an ongoing series of TV commercials, and Lionel Stander, whose burly physique and signature gruff voice led him to specialize over the course of his career in playing scary but lovable hoodlums.

I would highly recommend this film to fans of romantic comedy in general, and vintage screwball comedy in particular. If you haven't tried that sort of comedy, what sets it off from modern zany comedies is a pleasant lack of several things that occur all too commonly those films: there is no overblown, highly staged slapstick, no public urination by men, and no humiliation humor based on sex or semi-nudity.",1210464000,4,2497,4.777777777777778
