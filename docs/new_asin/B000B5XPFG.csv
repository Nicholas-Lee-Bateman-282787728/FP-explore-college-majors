2401263,5,B000B5XPFG,"This is my 2nd review of this DVD.

Now that I've been doing it a while I felt I could make an even better assessment.

All the abs workouts on this DVD are about 8 to 9 minutes long.

Mostly I am sticking with the Bootcamp Abs part of it, I have done a couple of the other workouts on it, but my abs desperately need Bootcamp Abs!

The instructor, Meghan White, is a very popular instructor and mostly releases dvds through Bodywise Media.

You start from the first second your hand lets go of your remote!  Meghan leads you through several repetitions of crunches and tells you to breathe.  She does several incarnations of these crunches, 1 leg up, 1 down.  Leg in, leg out.  Other side.

After doing those she starts working on your lower abs (which are my big problem area).  You are on your back.  Legs in the air.  Hands on your back.  Hips up, hips down.  Several repetitions of this.  You feel that you can't go on, but you do because she is doing the counting, and the music is perfect for this.

Then you've done those, and smaller ones with legs in the air.  Next, your legs are bent at the knee, still in the air, you're doing crunches.  You really feel that you can't go on, but you do.  Meghan is counting, so you know you can hang in there and go on.  ""4, 3, 2, 1..."".

A couple of different ones of those, and you did it!  You can do it!  It's only 9 minutes, but it's so hard!  This is great and challenging!

Meghan White is the best instructor there is.

EDIT: December 5, 2009:

Well, I haven't done this for a while, but once again I am doing it again.  I am seeing a difference in my abs.  I am doing the top 2 sets (one is Bootcamp Abs, the other is Kickboxing Abs).  I tried the Challenge Abs set and that is too much for me.  I do one set a day and go between the two of the sets I just mentioned, and I do it in the morning right after I feed the cats.  Is it making a difference?  I believe it is.  You don't want to know how bad my abs are.  Let's just say the fat hangs DOWN, now it's a little bit less hanging down..know what I mean?  I had to work up to doing this every day.  First I started with every other day because it was too much for me.  An added bonus is that since I have IBS-C this has been helping me with that problem.  Amazing!

Edit:  February 5, 2014

Am working with this - AGAIN.  Life happens!  So, I am taking weekly selfies and posting the pix on a private unseen photo account and have been doing this for 2 days.  The LOWER ABS are shrinking.  I've only been doing this for 2 days (along with a lot of other exercises) & cal counting, and I can see that it's working AGAIN.  I hope that this time I can commit to weight loss the entire way through.  Will again update in a few months. :)",1140652800,99,2743,4.027985074626866
2401264,5,B000B5XPFG,"I just got this DVD because I wanted something just for abs to get into shape for summer and this is it. I couldn't believe how effective it really is. The first time I tried it, my abs were aching which is what I wanted. Just a few minutes a day and I know that I'll be ready for summer with this DVD.",1140566400,6,302,3.8095238095238093
2401265,5,B000B5XPFG,"This DVD rocks, what more can I say, what a great collection and series of AB workouts.  I was looking for a DVD that could simulate my abs classes at the gym and this one is perfect.  Lots of routines and exercises variations.  Highly recommend.",1138924800,6,246,4.4222222222222225
2401266,5,B000B5XPFG,"I own just about every ab video/dvd out there.  I got this one a few days ago, and I just did the first beginning ab bootcamp.  It is great!  The main things I like so far about this dvd are; 1. They don't fool around with 15 minutes of warm up.  It is full on ab work beginning to end.  2.  There is just as much work on the lower ab area (which I need the most), and that was just in the first segment.  3.  There are six ab workouts, so I don't see myself getting bored in 2 months like I normally do.

I don't even know who has put this dvd out, but it is exactly what I was looking for, 100% ab work.",1136678400,196,605,3.7007874015748032

2401298,5,B000B5XPFG,One of the very best ab workouts I've ever done.  You will feel this one!  Nothing fancy about the dvd but it sure does the job.  This is my go-to.,1438473600,,147,3.8333333333333335

2401300,5,B000B5XPFG,"I bought this DVD 6 years ago but never used it for some reason. After a few years without real workout, I slowly returned to exercise on daily base. I'm doing Jillian's shred series, which is a good overall workout, but does not do much abs-wise. Even her 6 packs in 6 weeks I feel is relatively light on abs. Then I found this DVD in neglect and started doing it. It is a little boring, but it works. My abs feel sore after the workout. Now I'm combining this with Caban's pilate exercise, and I like that they are completely different styles. The other good thing about this DVD is no ad, no random speech or statement. It goes directly to the exercise.",1435104000,3,656,4.298387096774194
2401301,5,B000B5XPFG,"I'm one of the rare people who love doing crunches. A lot of people prefer a exercises that are done standing up or in plank, which is done on occasion, but for the most part, I think I achieve the best results the old-fashioned way. I do this dvd 2 or 3 times a week and do 2-4 of the workouts, depending on how much time I have. And I can safely say after a few months of regular use, I have a 6-pack (most days haha). The moves are not hard, and they don't get your heart rate up too much, but you can feel it in your abs, which is what you want. I do the workouts with ankle weights, and highly recommend that. I live this DVD! I lifted my shirt the other day after going out to eat with my husband and said ""look, I still have my abs after eating a whole plate of pasta!""",1433462400,5,776,3.85625
2401302,5,B000B5XPFG,"I got this DVD to use in addition to my regular daily workouts! It's a great workout for both beginners and advanced because of the two options for difficulty level. But don't expect to use this DVD once a day for a week and see ""major"" changes in your body. It takes time. Be patient and you'll love the results you'll start to see from this ab workout!",1433376000,,354,4.220588235294118
2401303,5,B000B5XPFG,Still my favorite abs dvd after owning for 3 years. There are sound issues but remembering to turn the tv down to almost mute corrects.,1431475200,,135,4.44

2401305,5,B000B5XPFG,"love this ab routine. Each one is only about 7 minutes, excluding stretching. I do two videos per day now. The beginning ones really are for beginners but they are challenging when you first start. Its simple and it works. I feel like longer ab videos are less effective b/c you're less likely to commit the time. I have made a habit of doing this video after I walk my dogs every morning, and now it feels strange to not do the video. Really happy for having this help.",1428710400,2,470,4.292134831460674

2401322,3,B000B5XPFG,This DVD was definitely too intense for someone closer to the beginner level like myself. Overall it's made up of fairly straightforward (read: very boring) routines. Also note that 2 of the 8 routines require extra equipment. But if you're looking for something no-nonsense and a bit of a challenge this might be right up your alley.,1416873600,,334,4.87719298245614

2401347,1,B000B5XPFG,This video basically shows the same crunches in different forms.  It is not a comprehensive ab workout because it doesn't include any back strengthening exercises.  It is more or less 8 different sculpting routines with the same crunches over and over again.  don't waste your money...,1394409600,,285,5.1521739130434785
2401348,5,B000B5XPFG,"I know some people find this dvd ""annoying, I'm not doing it for her voice, but for the RESULTS! And since they're
only 8-9 minutes exercises, I can suffer through them for that long. The one problem I encountered however, is the
sound! It's somewhat LOUD, but I adjust it accordingly and keep exercising! It works for me!",1391731200,,322,4.568965517241379

2401355,4,B000B5XPFG,"Inexpensive video that provides a variety of easy to follow an workouts, which is really all you need.

2401356,4,B000B5XPFG,"This is a video and I have used it a few times.  I like the exercises, but they are not extremely difficult.  They didn't leave me as sore as I'd hoped and I ended up doing two workouts each time I do the video.  One just doesn't leave my abs feeling worked.  Its a nice add on to other routines, though.",1374019200,,304,3.9344262295081966
2401357,4,B000B5XPFG,"I was worried my core was getting too weak after focusing on running for the last year...this was a nice confidence booster. Simple, well timed, but not too intense.

There were 3 'beginner' segments, and 3 more advanced. I did the beginner first time around and only did advanced after that. Great place to start as well as a great place for intermediates.

Only 4/5 stars because her voice is horrrrrible....I really like the dvd content, but to complete this I have to put the tv volume on 3......",1372377600,,500,4.606741573033708

2401359,5,B000B5XPFG,"I think this Perfect Abs DVD is perfect.  It is my ""go to"" exercise DVD.  It consists of several 5 to 10 minute abs workouts, so you can pick a different one every day of the week, and it doesn't get boring.  I use it when I only have about 15 minutes to work out, but I also use it after I do a yoga dvd or another workout dvd and did not feel I got enough of an ab workout.  I have had it for about 5 years now and I still use it at least once a week.  Meghan White really did a great job with this dvd.",1371600000,,505,3.5545454545454547

2401361,5,B000B5XPFG,Great workout in only 8 minutes.  Very challenging when first used.  But only in a few minutes a day can help to building a stronger core.  Highly recommended!,1363824000,,159,4.607142857142857
2401362,5,B000B5XPFG,"This is a great workout.  You'll really feel it.  Make sure you stretch afterward, too, otherwise your stomach muscles will be in serious pain a few hours later.",1362960000,,161,4.714285714285714
2401363,3,B000B5XPFG,"The woman's voice is kind of squeaky and annoying - or something.  It's like her voice is hoarse.  So that is kind of distracting, but it is a nice quick workout you will feel the next day.",1361750400,,189,4.081081081081081
2401364,5,B000B5XPFG,"I purchased this tape to replace an 18 minute abs dvd (circa 1998) that my husband accidently threw away.

2401365,5,B000B5XPFG,"This is a great ab workout for people who don't have much time (8-10 mins). The 8 segments are short but they put you to work! No breaks or cardio to boost your heartrate (burpees etc), just straight ab moves! This DVD is great because there are segments for all fitness levels- beginner, intermediate and advanced. Also, it's so important to change up your workout so that you target different muscles and your body does not become accustomed to any moves! It's not as hard as P90X but it is very difficult and you will absolutely be challenged and see results.",1358035200,,562,4.574257425742574
2401366,4,B000B5XPFG,"Overall, I like the DVD although I hate sit ups...  The bootcamp abs is about 8 minutes in length and gets easier after a few times.  I would buy again, and am looking forward to getting to the higher levels.",1356825600,,208,4.175
2401387,3,B000B5XPFG,"I'm not as impressed as many other reviewers.  There is no introduction whatsoever; you don't even know who this person is or see her standing up to assess the state of her core.  She starts off at least six of the routines with the same first set of crunches, and a few times I thought perhaps I had chosen the prior routine by mistake. There aren't any new or particularly innovative moves here at all, and there are way too many of the same crunch moves with tiny variations from one routine to the next. You can really hardly tell them apart.  The annoyance factor is kind of high:  Either she wasn't mic'd properly, or her voice is simply not suited to this kind of thing, and it's not like there aren't plenty of other trainers who are able to work out and call the moves without creaking and croaking.  I bought it based on the high reviews, but I really don't see the attraction.",1352592000,,887,4.351515151515152
2401388,5,B000B5XPFG,This is a great exercise video.  I am actually enjoying the exercises.  The sets are 8 to minutes long so it's not to long.  You can do as many as you want.,1350518400,,156,3.8125
2401389,5,B000B5XPFG,"I definitely think that in order to have a great body, you have to do total body workouts and eat well. Some days though, I don't have as much time or I just want to do an ab workout. When that is the case, this is my ""go to"" DVD!!! I love that it is divided into 8-9 min segments, so you can do as many or as few as time allows. I also love that the exercises are all done on the floor-as my back can bother me at times and this allows me to work my abs hard without straining my back!!!!",1347148800,,489,3.7115384615384617
2401390,5,B000B5XPFG,"I bought this because it was a top-rated abs video on Amazon last September and was not disappointed.  The video is hard work, but if you keep with it you will get results.  Recently I started doing this regularly 2 - 3 times a week, two of the routines per session, for a total of 16 minutes a session.

I can now report I am one size smaller in my underwear.  Can also see more definition in my upper abs, which seems to be the main target of the video.  Will continue doing it for further improvement.

For those of us who don't have money for a personal trainer, this is a good investment that brings a reasonable return for the small amount of time and money spent.",1342828800,,670,4.1953125
2401391,5,B000B5XPFG,"This DVD doesn't contain any new cutting edge ab strength training moves or anything, but it sticks with the classics and does a very good job of it.  There is 3 beginner routines, 3 advanced routines, and 2 bonus pilates routines.  They are all very good.  Even though each workout is only 8-9 minutes you certainly get a nonstop, ab concentrated workout for that amount of time.  If I had to say anything negative it would be that the lower ab work isn't always as amazing, but it's still pretty good and varies with each workout.  Great DVD.",1316736000,,544,4.510204081632653

Just under 10 minutes a day and you can see your progress... it's definitely worth buying! It's only about 10 dollars which is a GREAT deal and a great way to get nice abs and if your planning on investing in a more intense program, this is a great way to get started and get used to working out everyday and strengthen your core before moving forward.

The crunch routines BURN.  And the time to do it is good if you are adding on to a workout already.  Your sure to finish this before the little devil tells you you have had enough.

2401442,3,B000B5XPFG,"I've had this DVD about a week now. I've been alternating between the three Advanced Workouts. On the positive side, as many have mentioned, this does get right to the chase. No warm-ups, no explanations or chit chat...and I love that about this. I typically do my abs tapes after I've worked out to another tape so I don't need a warm-up and am not wanting to have to bypass lots of chit chat. I also like the fact that the lower abs are targeted, something a lot of us want. There's no rest during the 8-9 minute segments, another plus in my opinion.

Now, for the bad...others have said it and I agree, the pitchiness of the instructor's voice. Holy moly, I guess it just depends on your tolerance level...let's just say I turn the volume way down for this one and then it's not so bad. I don't see much difference between the three advanced segments. The ""kickboxing"" one...not quite sure why it's titled that. There's just really a lot of the same going on but they are effective moves, I'll give it that. I do wish more attention was paid to the obliques.

So, like I said, there's good and there's bad. Would I recommend this DVD to someone? I think I would mainly for the fact that it is so no-nonsense, no frills.

2401484,4,B000B5XPFG,"A little bit about me:  42yr, 6ft, 195lb and very fit.  Been doing P90X for the last 120 days or so and still going strong with that.  It also has a great abs workout in it, but very different from this one I'm reviewing here.  I now do my P90X routine and on days when it's ab workout time (it's about 17minutes), I'll follow it up with 2 or 3 of the short videos from 'Perfect Abs'.  This gives me about 1/2hr on abs total and I will feel it for a while!  Now for my review of 'Perfect Abs'.

A better title for this DVD would be, ""Perfect Crunches"".  There are 8 videos, each about 7-9 minutes long.  No messing around, no breaks...just simply banging out an assortment of crunches...most of which you probably haven't seen before.  And they are effective.  A little focus on obliques now and then, but not much.  You can do all of this sitting in front of your t.v. lying in one spot which is nice I suppose.

The bad:  not much really, and I'm nitpicking to be sure.  The title is a little misleading-I was expecting a more 'thorough' abs workout...various hanging knee raises, bicycles, side rises, etc.  If it was called 'Perfect Crunches' then I'd be giving it a thumbs up with 5 stars with rave reviews.  The woman is a little annoying with her voice, so turn it down where you can barely hear her. For some reason I find her completely unattractive.  I'm sure the females reading this will tear me up for writing that, but I do think a better looking person leading the video would help motivate.  She gives this evil little stare now and then at the camera.  My wife usually cracks up when she does that and says it looks like she's doing something naughty!  I don't see that, but somebody should have told her not to look at the camera.

The good:  7-9 minute videos that really hammer your mid-section.  If you are in good shape put 2 or 3 together for a nice workout.  She wastes no time which I like.  Hit play and get on your back quick.

As you can see from probably 90% of the reviews on here they are probably targeting women for this video.  It was my wife who actually picked this up.  For $12 you can't really go wrong with it.  I initially passed it over when I looked at a few reviews and they were all female.  I thought that maybe men were avoiding it....so I did as well.  Now that I've gone through it a few times (and will continue doing so), I really think that the people who own this are making a big-time marketing mistake by not targeting the male market.  Throw a male model with 6pack abs on this and change the box a bit (this one looks 'girly')...change title to 'Perfect Crunches' or some such thing and they'll hit an entirely new market.

Because the workouts ranges from 8-10 minutes, there was no time to stop and take a break, once I got used to the pace, I felt amazing results.

I was doing it 3 times a week and I have been regularly doing it for four weeks now and saw a significant change happening to my flabby abs. When I should actually be jumping for joy I am unable to do so as I have a nagging ""pressure"" feeling in my neck and upper back. So I have stopped doing the abs for now.

There are no ABS, no talking, just doing ABS.  You will feel your abs burning after about 3 minutes because there are no breaks, so in as little as 7 minutes you will get a moderate AB workout.  If you want more, just move to the next workout and in 15 minutes total you would have done your abs for the day.

This video gives 6 different segments of exercises that vary between 8 and 9 minutes long.  All of them are wonderful.  If you want a REALLY good workout for your stomach do a couple of them, but one is usually enough.  Strongly suggest this video.",1168300800,5,392,4.256756756756757
2401704,5,B000B5XPFG,"I Strongly recommend this DVD. Great 6 short but pretty hard workouts. Not a single second waisted. No annoying advertisement.

Just straight to work on your abdominal muscles. Quite hard, burning, working.

I've been doing just one 8 or 9 minutes workout every day for a week and I see the result already.",1162080000,20,306,4.754716981132075
2401705,5,B000B5XPFG,"This is a great DVD.  I purchased this one, ""8-minute workouts"", and ""killer butt"".  This one is definitely the best.  ""Killer Butt"" comes with endless advertisement in the beginning.  ""8-minute workouts"" is less interesting and the movements in those workouts put strain on my neck.  Even though ""Perfect Abs"" offers repetitive workouts, but since they are done in an interesting way, you feel it's just another set, without feeling bored.  And that really helps achieving the goals -- strong and flat abs!  This is definitely the best Abs workout I have done!  And I was already capable of doing over 150 crunches before doing this DVD.",1153180800,19,638,4.952830188679245
2401706,5,B000B5XPFG,"Hey guys, I totally hate doing abs, but this chick warms up quick, the workouts are challenging but not impossible and defenily you feel the burn... in few minutes you really feel you are working your abs, I personally try to do 2 or even 3 of the routines because they are so short you do not get bored and after finishing you want more...

Music is not anoying, neither the instructor...

I truly recomen it ! I LOVE IT !, and is from somebody that HATES ! to do abs....

Buy it is really worth it give it a try.... I have tried so many and this one I really like..

Please do more DVDs like this one for butt, thights and arms...",1153094400,15,632,4.07258064516129
2401707,5,B000B5XPFG,I bought this exercise DVD three weeks ago and have been doing the beginner level ab workouts every other day. I like the fact that there are no commercials or introductions to fast forward through. The exercises are really short (10 minutes) so I can do this workout in addition to pilates or other strength training DVD's and get about an hour worth of aerobic activity; it's convenient. The workouts are also designed much better than what I would do on my own (crunch's and sit ups); there's a lot of variety to each workout-it doesn't get boring. Note: The advanced level workout's are bit jarring on the lower back- so work your way up.,1152230400,18,642,4.591304347826087
2401708,4,B000B5XPFG,"This DVD is excellent as far as the workout goes. I really felt the burn on each of the three beginning abs workouts. I was surprised that the ""kickboxing"" routine is done laying on your back though.

I certainly still felt the burn, although I'm not sure how a person ""kickboxes"" from the prone position. Nevertheless the workouts are intense and target mostly the upper abs. The lower abs and obliques also get some time but not as much as I would like.

I found the lead trainer's voice somewhat irritating, but that is a really small thing, and I'm probably being over critical since the key point is to get a good abs workout, which I have done each time I've gone through one of the various workouts.

The six workouts are really only 3 workouts with a beginner and advanced version of each.

I am a physically fit 35-year-old soldier, and I found the beginner routines fairly challenging. If you are out of shape, plan on it taking a while to be able to get through an entire 8 or 9 minute workout. You may need to pause and rest and build up to the point where you get through the whole thing over a period of time.",1151539200,91,1123,4.333333333333333
2401709,5,B000B5XPFG,"I hate sit-ups but this video is worth it because it works.  I have been losing weight with diet and aerobic exercise and have come to a stand-still so I decided to add some ab work and light resistance training.  Within 1-2 weeks of doing this DVD I started receiving compliments of how ""skinny"" I look.  I could fit into my size 10's again because my waist was beginning to trim down!

I like this video becuase the instructor is not annoying.  She simply tells you what to do without fluff.  There is no intro (warm up) which I like.  There are six routines to choose from so if I only have 8 minutes I can just do one.  If I have enough time I like to do THREE of the six workouts.  Which is amazingly hard.

It has Beginning and Advanced Versions of BootCamp Abs, Kickboxing Abs, and Strengh Abs.",1148515200,26,801,4.245033112582782
2401710,5,B000B5XPFG,"This lady is not wasting your time. The workout sessions start right away, with no ""blah-blah"" around. No warming up either, so you need to be laying down ready to go once you push the start button. There are 3 different workouts, each is 8 or 9 minutes long and each has 2 levels of difficulty. I have to admit I didn't get to the harder level yet. I do every day different workout, so my muscles don't get into routine and I get never bored. Her voice and encouragement are just perfect, she motivates you without being annoying.",1147305600,2,531,4.373737373737374
2401711,5,B000B5XPFG,Why I love this DVD: all ab routines are under 10 minutes and very challenging. I do the 3 challenging ones & it's less than 25 minutes. I'm always looking for advanced ab routines & was very happy to find this from the reviews here at Amazon.,1146182400,9,243,4.191489361702128

It's divived into 8-9 minute sessions so you can do a different routine every time and it's not boring at all. I am glad that I got this DVD. I am starting to see real results only after one week. Highly recommend it.",1145923200,7,297,4.137931034482759
2401713,5,B000B5XPFG,"This is a great DVD. It's the abs DVD I've been looking for for the past year and a half. I love how it has all the different workouts.

I just had a baby 7 weeks ago and the 3 beginning workouts are challenging, but doable. I can't wait to do the advanced workouts to get back to where I was pre-pregnancy.

I like how it just gets right to the workouts, no beating around the bush, so you can get it done quickly.

There are 8 different workouts on here. 3 8-9 minute beginner, 3 8-9 minute advanced, and two bonus workouts, one Pilates inspired and the other with a hand weight. You just can't get bored with this DVD.

I highly recommend it!",1145404800,18,645,4.136
2401714,5,B000B5XPFG,"The video advertises that it has 8 different ab workouts, but it actually has 10 (2 extra).  The workouts are about 8-10 minutes each, but are hard-hitting ab workouts with excellent instructions, demonstrations, and motivational comments.  This is great because you can do a different workout every day of the week so your muscles don't get used to any one exercise.",1144800000,6,367,5.0

You do some serious work and yes it does hurt! I loved it though because there is no previews, or alot of chatter! the instructor is right to the point, and if you are serious about your abs- this is the tape for you!",1142812800,5,377,3.973684210526316
8081978,4,B000B5XPFG,"I honestly can't say if you can get ""perfect abs"" from using this product regularly, because I didn't ever use it regularly. I did, however, integrate a lot of the workouts into my regular exercise routine. Some of the exercises I did find to be effective and were exercises I had not seen before.

If you are new to ab workouts or just want an ab workout to follow in the comfort of your home, this isn't a bad purchase. You can get all this type of info online for free, but flipping this on for eight minutes and having the woman walk you through each workout is convenient and motivating.",1507075200,,592,4.333333333333333

It's mostly focused on upper and lower, less oblique but that's fine. Literally within 20 minutes of work you will feel achieved and look the part. The only downsides are that it doesn't stretch into the workout, just jumps into it, some exercises are very poorly planned like just rest a dumbbell on your chest/shoulder, and her voice is so freaking annoying that you will be glad it's short.",1448582400,,538,4.795698924731183
