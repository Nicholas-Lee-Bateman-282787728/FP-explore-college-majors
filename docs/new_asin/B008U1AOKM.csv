5183049,3,B008U1AOKM,like season one the case the part where the thing holds the dvds was broken so two disc was lose and one was scratch up I haven't watch that one yet to see it is working. Will have to do so very soon.  Not very happy. Do not recommend people to buy this from this person.,1401235200,,271,3.8392857142857144
5183050,5,B008U1AOKM,I love this anime show. It has both adventure and romance in it. Two of my favorite things when it comes to anime shows!,1394582400,,120,4.041666666666667
5183051,5,B008U1AOKM,its came in good condition with no problem it is an excellent anime and it was amazing to watch and see,1379289600,,103,3.9523809523809526
5183052,4,B008U1AOKM,"Love the anime! It is very entertaining and I love the plot. The only problem I have with this product is that the case is very poorly created. There is no way all four disks are held safely in this case. I received all four disks scratched up and so I had to pay to fix them. The case doesn't hold the CDs well at all!!!! Which really pisses me off, but I absolutely love this anime. This anime is fantastic!",1376179200,4,409,4.061728395061729
5183053,5,B008U1AOKM,"I already owned Season One. I couldn't wait to see the rest of the story in Season Two. It did not disappoint! A lot of heart, drama, romance, action and comedy. Made me root for the heroes/heroines. And a great ending!
Except those under 13, I'd recommend this to fans of all ages. (It does have a bit of sexual situations and implications not suited for younger kids.)",1374105600,,370,4.455882352941177
5183054,1,B008U1AOKM,"The box set in question consists of 4 discs, 2 on each side of the case. I'm on my second one of these, both cases have come with broken center spindles resulting in loose and BADLY scratched discs. I tried calling Media Blasters, the company that is publishing these, their telephone was disconnected. Also they have no contact info on their website. I have been trying to get this for my girlfriend, who is a big Fushigi Yugi, fan and it has been a horribly disappointing experience. Media Blasters does not seem to care one way or the other whether or not the discs that you are paying for work. The company is located here in NYC and I think I might drop by ask if there is a better way to get the discs.",1370476800,,708,4.2518518518518515
5183055,1,B008U1AOKM,"This is not a review for the series itself, but rather for the company who unfortunately got their hands on the license. This company has always ALWAYS had horrible packaging for their disks! Enough people complained about the first season of Fushigi Yugi being horribly packaged in a flimsy case where they were not being held in place, therefore most of the time the disks were lose and scratched. There is no excuse for that.  Oh? They still play, right?  But they shouldn't even come to the consumer all beaten up like that! Some of us are serious collectors!

Just a note, I bought my season 1 case at Best Buy ... all the cases they had contained loose disks, so it doesn't even matter if you pick it up physically or have it shipped out to you.

And guess what ... I just received my season 2 disks today. Same exact type of casing ... all the disks loose and scratched! I could return it, but I am 100% confident that I'd just get another busted up case with loose, scratched disks. What's funny (not really) is that my season 1 case had a super thin piece of foam in the case, I guess it was ""supposed"" to keep the disks in place (great job that did ... NOT). The season 2 case didn't even have this piece of foam. I guess the company had to make MORE budget cuts ...

This is UNACCEPTABLE. Sure, save money on packaging, but at the expense of giving bad quality products to your customers (not amazon, but media blasters/ anime works). I really hope it's worth it. I hope more people speak out about it because you fellow consumers really deserve better than this.

I also like how their website doesn't have a way to contact them ... probably because they don't want to own up to all their mistakes and take all the complaints.

So BUYER BEWARE ... you'll be getting scratched disks that MIGHT still play ...",1363132800,19,1819,4.379821958456973
5183056,5,B008U1AOKM,"This is what the season one boxset from media blasters should have been! A sturdy interior where the discs don't fall out.

Apparently they heard the complaints and thankfully the discs stay in place. Everything arrived in excellent condition.

Also the slip cover is different from what amazon has displayed (with Miaka & Tomahome).

But overall no complaints especially since this half is the best part of Fushigi Yugi! Definitely worth the purchase.",1361923200,,452,5.164383561643835
5183057,1,B008U1AOKM,"Boooo, it is not a proper set. It is burned copies. Mine has a couple episodes of the main menu, no movie. I had to go down to the fourth listed video to hget an episode. Now i not sure if it will be a whole episode or a partial episode. It shows up as data disc on my blu-ray.",1482105600,3,277,3.6333333333333333
5183058,3,B008U1AOKM,"This Box set came in horrible condition, and the DVDs just fell out. It's a great show so if you going to buy it be ready to replace the DVD box. For both Season 1 and 2..",1459296000,,171,3.6486486486486487
5183059,1,B008U1AOKM,"My rating is not on the series itself. It is on the discs. Unlike some of the others, my discs are not scratched or the holders broken. The discs won't play in any device I put them in. They get ejected and say that the format is not compatible. Season one works fine.",1454112000,,268,4.0754716981132075

5183062,5,B008U1AOKM,It came factory seemed and arrived earlier than expected,1426723200,,56,5.333333333333333
5183063,5,B008U1AOKM,The movie came in perfect condition and the packaging suffered no injury or denting. I was really happy because the movie came at least a week before its expected delivery date. The product itself is beautiful and the animation in my opinion is better than the animation of the old box sets as well as this one is cheaper. I think this is a good buy.,1415404800,,350,4.318181818181818
5183064,5,B008U1AOKM,"The only Anime I will ever enjoy watching!
Such a great series.
The case that it came in was really flimsy and broke when it was dropped, but the DVDs were not broken.",1410566400,,167,4.090909090909091

5183066,3,B008U1AOKM,"The discs in the package were loose, like some of the other reviewers described. Shipped via dhl by the amazon dealer I went with. Luckily they all played and I was able to enjoy the second season of this anime.  Strike one against this license holder.

Strike two? unprofessional - if you care about your brand and mis-program the menu, of course you receive error messages.  The menus still work, but that is shoddy work, especially if you want us to be impressed.",1403913600,,466,4.590361445783133
8530441,3,B008U1AOKM,"The dvd case is so flimsy and does not fair well in shipping. Inside of my case was broken and none of the DVDs were being held securely in place. One was even scratched but still playable.  I have to replace case to not further damage  DVDs. The series itself is great, I am a huge fan!!",1525824000,,288,4.035087719298246

8530443,4,B008U1AOKM,"This season had the same issues as the first season, a lead character who was easily manipulated (very frustrating). The other characters were interesting, except the friend, who was constantly flipping her personality like she was schizophrenic. Very annoying. Overall, the show was good.",1521244800,,289,5.590909090909091
8530444,1,B008U1AOKM,"I couldn't play the DVD and when I finally did it freezes up here and there and the audio will change back from English to Japanese. This is not an original DVD, it is just a copy. For the price that I paid, I would expect an original DVD not a copy.",1514419200,,250,3.826923076923077

8530450,4,B008U1AOKM,"Great show, but I really wish the packaging and video quality was better.  Make sure you have another multi-disk case ready for transfer, because at least one of the disks are sure to be loose by the time it arrives in your mailbox.  I hope Funimation or another reputable company acquires the license for this fantastic anime someday and re-releases a remastered blu-ray complete series edition (but I won't hold my breath).",1487635200,,425,4.888888888888889
