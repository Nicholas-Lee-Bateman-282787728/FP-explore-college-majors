8156494,5,B000KGH0DY,"I bought this set mainly for the silent classics that were much cheaper buying this set than individually. IF you could find them individually. The silent version in this set of ""The Last of the Mohicans"" is great.  The silent version of ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"" is a very impressive silent movie.  It is almost unbelievable that such a film could have been filmed in 1916.  Another favorite from the set is ""The Prisoner of Zenda"".  It is a great early swashbuckler that I find myself watching over and over.  ""Robin Hood"" with Douglas Fairbanks is a well done silent film. I was somewhat disappointed in ""The Adventures of Tarzan"".  It was advertised and being better than the origial Tarzan but I don't agree with that opinion.

Some of the early talkies are good also.  ""The Most Dangerous Game"" with Fay Wray and Joel McCrea is a thrilling watch.  ""East of Borneo"" is another good adventure yarn I find myself watching again and again.  ""Mr. Robinson Crusoe"" is another Douglas Fairbanks film (but a talkie this time) and is more light hearted than the other films in this set.  ""Son of Monte Cristo"" is okay. ""The Jungle Book"" is okay.  ""Beneath the 12 Mile Reef"" is okay. ""The Snows of Kilamanjaro"" is movie that has never impressed me.

So now you have the entire list of what is in this set and my personal opinion of them.  If you like silent and early talkies in the adventure genre you will appreciate this set.  If you are not familiar with this type of film this would be a good place to start.  I consider this one of the better ""collections"" I have purchased.",1355702400,,1581,4.53356890459364
