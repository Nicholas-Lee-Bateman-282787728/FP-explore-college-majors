5569181,3,B00BB62EII,"Full plot outlines are easy to come by in other reviews here or elsewhere. I want to review this film strictly to tell you it's worth your time to see an actress at the top of her game. From Amy Madigan's first frame, she's riveting. People talk about roles where all of an actor's personal vanity is dropped. This is one of those. You will not catch her acting; she even *thinks* in character.

I have a deep appreciation for anyone who spends decades honing their skill in any field. Their mastery is a gift for the rest of us. I will be far from the first person to lament the absence of roles in filmdom for older people, especially actresses. It's a damn shame when the best far too often have to sit out on the sidelines. I am oh so happy to say Amy Madigan is not going quietly.",1397174400,2,785,4.198675496688741
5569182,4,B00BB62EII,"Now and then a movie comes along that throws me for a loop. I sit and enjoy it, but can't really figure out if it was any good or not. This is one of those movies.

Here's the scoop. Lauduree (Perla Haney-Jardine) is a budding and exceptionally bright girl whose mother has just ditched her to try and make it as a makeup artist in Hollywood. Lauduree is in the middle of some plant based experiments to try to determine shifting weather patterns. She needs to keep mom's disappearance on the down low to stay in the game. Grandma Greta (Amy Madigan) finds out and does her best to help. Lauduree's teacher, Ms. Markovi (Lili Taylor) is also in to help as best she can. Can water find it's own level here?

This is writer/director Jenny Deller's expansion of her earlier short film also starring Perla. It was a wise choice to keep her because she's mostly what's happening here. Madigan does a really good job and Taylor is okay, but it's Perla who steals the show. She gives a very believable performance. She's smart, cocky and tough but also struggles with the confusion of her coming of age. When she tries on mom's shoes or makeup curiosity/confusion is all over her. She has a gangly walk and just hasn't grown into herself yet. And her friendship with a bright, sweet classmate Neel allows her to stick her toe in the water for that first kiss, but you see she isn't quite ready. But she's passionate about our planet and is diligent in her record keeping of her experiment. She figures she might not have a future. One scene, where she goes off on a bunch of bystanders about our abuse of the planet is a bit much but it gives Perla a chance to let loose.

This is directed and shot nicely and sports a lot of nice music. It's an indy flick through and through. It does have both a story and character arc so it's not like a slice of lifer where it just stops. I enjoyed watching it very much, but I don't know that I'd revisit it.",1379376000,,1940,4.3535911602209945
5569183,2,B00BB62EII,"The performance of the lead actress and the premise of the film are both unbelievable, but not in the same way.  The girl inhabits the role with authority and is outstanding.  Unfortunately, though, she cannot carry what is otherwise a contrived premise--that of a young girl on an environmental quest despite the abandonment of her mother.  The weakness of the girl's living situation damages the believability of her environmental quest--a quest which devolves into eco-preaching.",1369785600,,482,5.4
5569184,5,B00BB62EII,"Lovely, unexpectedly engaging, funny, sad, and quietly triumphant, this movie chronicles a dysfunctional family evolving through the eyes of a precocious, budding environmental scientist ... Gotta see it to get it.",1367366400,2,214,5.935483870967742
5569185,4,B00BB62EII,"""Future Weather"" finds a bright young girl trying to spread the word about climate change while her personal world is collapsing.  Launduree (Perla Haney-Jardine), age 13, is forever trying to inform her rural Illinois community about the dangers of global warning.  She plants trees wherever possible and lectures her best friend about the importance of mussels to the marine environment.

One day she comes home to her trailer park to find a note from her single mom (Marin Ireland) saying she has gone off to Hollywood to follow her dream of being a makeup artist to the stars.  All she leaves behind is $50.  Still, Launduree clings to her home and a school carbon dioxide experiement.  But her grandmother (Amy Madigan) has other plans.  Thrust together, they learn to trust each other in the face of an uncertain future.

The film works best as a character study of a youngster too intelligent for her environment and Ms. Hanley-Jardine does an admirable job anchoring the movie.  Ms. Madigan as a hard-working, hard-drinking blue-collar woman overcomes the stereotypical aspects of the role.  The picture calls attention not only to climate change, but also to the concern of the young about the planet they will inherit.

Bonus features include deleted scenes and the short film, ""Save the Future.""",1366502400,2,1306,5.027906976744186
8565181,5,B00BB62EII,"You will NOT be disappointed in this little film. If you liked growing up in the 70's (roughly this time period), you will see some of the old things we had like rotary telephones and answering machines. but they only add to the sincerity of the work. Amy Madigan is superb, the actor playing Ray understates his role perfectly and Lilly Taylor is perfect as always. Young Perla makes a great debut here, both she and the young man playing her science class friend are superb. The work is solid, charming, does NOT sugar coat anything and the entire film is a valuable hour (or so) spent. So wonderful to see a film of this kind come about.",1506643200,,640,4.432203389830509
8565182,5,B00BB62EII,"Amazing film! Real, poignant complex tale of environmental fears, all the grounds crumbling underneath, and how people shift in it all.",1503014400,,135,5.476190476190476
8565183,1,B00BB62EII,"Clearly a propaganda film spreading a false ""WARNING"" of the effects of Global Warming / Climate Change. Shows a girl that has been brain washed by the school system and the brain washers at work in the classroom.

Tell a lie often enough and it becomes the truth. To paraphrase Goebels.

Too Damn bad it can't be rated zero stars as that is what it deserves.",1501200000,,359,4.424242424242424

8565189,4,B00BB62EII,"Sweet film.  I didn't expect much from it when I chose it, but was quite surprised.  Enjoyed the female cast a great deal, especially the protagonist.  Refreshing change to see a film without violence, car crashes, nudity, profanity, etc.  And nice to see a movie about women just trying to live their lives.",1404691200,,308,4.754716981132075
