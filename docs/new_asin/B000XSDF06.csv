8229335,4,B000XSDF06,"I am old enough to remember going to drive-ins and while some people might have fond memories of making out there, I was still too young for that so I have memories I am sure others share--like going to the show in pajamas so not to inconvenience my parents if I fell asleep and the barrage of ads urging a visit to the concession stand (which, sad to say, Mom and Dad generally resisted).  The animated images of dancing drink cups were powerful and when I came across Hey Folks, It's Intermission Time, I knew this was something I had to have (first in VHS, then DVD).  I found it delightfully retro.  The bits for the concession stand dominate (well, that is where the drive-ins made a lot of their money) and while to my adult eye, the food being offered looks rather unappetizing, I can understand why a kid would find it so appealing.  There are nice little spots letting customers know how much time is left in intermission.  Also included are ads for local businesses and it is quite fun to see styles of forty or fifty years ago.  I was struck at how quaint an ad for a Honda motorcycle dealership was; it was hardly a rebel or outlaw image being projected.  A clothing store's ad suggests there was a time when men found plaid suits fashionable.  Of course, the country underwent changes in the 1960's and there is an attempt made to cash in on the hippie movement in a Season's Greetings spot.  Also included are some of the earliest public messages regarding the coming of the movie ratings system and we can see some of the original variations (""PG"" was originally ""GP"" and there was ""M"" for Mature).  It is also notable that early on, the X rating meant no one under 17 or 16 could attend.  Some people might have issues with certain images such as a man speaking in an exaggerated Italian accent or a shrimp roll that has a stereotypical Chinese mascot.  Still, viewers should recall that standards and sensitivities were different then.  I did not like how some sequences were repeated.  Overall, however, I found this enjoyable viewing and probably more fun than the actual feature films.",1341273600,,2105,4.5638297872340425
