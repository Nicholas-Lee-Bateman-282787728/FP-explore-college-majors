8452196,4,B000H0MN3A,"I remembered this series from a few years ago and decided to rewatch it, it actually turned out a little better than I remember (excluding the theme song) they say ""hell"" more than I remember but they say it at the funniest times, the product information is a bit deceiving it says the video is 22 min and that made me hesitant to buy it because of the money to minute ratio I have but the video has 4 episodes each episode is about 22 min adding up to 88 minutes of show time, I love it love it love it and I highly recommend you buy it if you are/ were a fan of the show",1360281600,,572,3.8974358974358974
