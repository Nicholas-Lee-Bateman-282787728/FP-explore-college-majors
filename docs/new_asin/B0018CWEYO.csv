3417025,5,B0018CWEYO,"Desperate Housewives - The Complete Fourth Season was a hot and sizzling season even with the chaos surrounding the writer's strike. I wasn't a big fan of the third season but I am glad creator Marc Cherry got this show back on track. I love the character development this season, Dana Delany joined the cast and boy she is a tremendous talent. Marcia Cross, Eva Longoria, and Felicity Huffman had their best acting this season, as you can tell I am not a fan of Teri Hatcher (they don't need her!). My favorite storyline was the long-waited reunion of Carlos and Gaby, finally those two are a couple again. Can't wait for season five, especially now that the show has time-traveled to five years later. I highly recommend this gem, enjoy!",1212451200,3,739,4.648854961832061
3417026,5,B0018CWEYO,"Katherine Mayfair, Susan's old neighbor from 12 years ago returns after an extended departure, but there's something awfully strange going on in that family.

Meanwhile, Katherine and Adam have a brief conversation about something terrible that happened in Dylan's old room that ""she can't remember"". Seeing as though Desperate Housewives does not dwell into supernatural elements (and if it does, then asta la vista!), there's not really too many sensible reasons to explain Dylan's memory loss except for maybe some brain trauma, drugging, or maybe... as Julie suggested, Dylan isn't really Dylan? When season five debuts in the fall of 2008, it'll be interesting to see what will be going on.

This show is only going to get better in my opinion.",1211932800,2,1290,5.089622641509434
3417027,5,B0018CWEYO,"""Desperate Housewives"" made its debut in 2004 to rave reviews and high Nielsen ratings. Season one of the show is considered a modern classic. For most people, the same couldn't be said for seasons two and three. Many people though the second and third seasons were disappointing. I thought the second season was good (though not great), and the third season was a slight improvement over season two (though it still didn't top the first season). But after watching the entire fourth season of ""Desperate Housewives"", the show is back on track. This is the best season since the first.

Season four of the show about those housewives from the fictional Wisteria Lane (located in the town of Fairview) was the most interesting, most intriguing, and most entertaining season since season one. Many of the same major characters are back: Susan, Lynette, Bree, Gabrielle, Edie, Mike, Carlos, Tom, Orson, and narrator Mary Alice. But what really makes the fourth season of ""Desperate Housewives"" so great is the addition of a new character: Katherine Mayfair. As season four begins, we find out that Katherine used to live on Wisteria Lane many years ago but has now moved back to the neighborhood with her much younger husband Adam and daughter Dylan. And yes, we can tell from the first episode that Katherine is hiding a deep dark secret that will eventually unfold as the season progresses. Some of the other major storylines throughout season four include: Lynette battling cancer (which she discovered late in season three); Susan (after marrying Mike at the end of season three) finds out that she's pregnant; Bree faking a pregnancy to protect daughter Danielle's real pregnancy; Mike developing a drug problem when he becomes addicted to pills; Gabrielle finding marriage to town mayor Victor Lang to be so dull that she starts having an affair with ex-husband Carlos; and probably the biggest story of the year, Wisteria Lane being destroyed by a tornado.

That tornado episode, titled ""Something's Coming"" (episode #9), was easily the best episode of the season and the second best episode overall (the very best episode of ""Desperate Housewives"" still remains that supermarket hostage crisis episode from season three). This was reportedly the most expensive episode of ""Desperate Housewives"" to date, obviously since special effects played a big part in it. But just like that supermarket hostage episode, it's a thrilling and entertaining episode that keeps you on the edge of your seat as you wonder who will come out of it alive or dead.

The stars of this show once again do a great job just as they have in the previous three seasons. Teri Hatcher, Felicity Huffman, Marcia Cross, Eva Longoria Parker, and Nicolette Sheridan are fine as usual, but in season four they get upended by the newcomer to Wisteria Lane. Two-time Emmy winner Dana Delany (""China Beach"") is an absolute standout as Katherine Mayfair. There's an interesting back-story involving Delany and ""Desperate Housewives"" when the show's creator Marc Cherry was casting the principal roles back in 2004. Cherry originally offered Delany the role of Bree, but turned it down since she claimed it was too similar to a role she had on a short-lived TV series she starred on a few years earlier (that show was called ""Pasadena"", which aired on FOX). But Cherry never gave up on her. After he created new character Katherine he wanted Delany for the part, and this time she accepted. It's interesting because Katherine is kind of like Bree, but only darker. And Delany stepped right into the role of Katherine and made it her own. I think this was similar to what Cherry and the rest of the ""Desperate Housewives"" writers were trying to do two years ago when they created the Betty Applewhite character for season two and failed miserably. This time they got it right, and the writers should be congratulated for not messing up the Katherine Mayfair storyline. This was an intriguing storyline throughout season four, and it ends perfectly in the final episode. And what makes it even better, Delany's Katherine will be back next season.

My only complaint about ""Desperate Housewives: The Complete Fourth Season"" is that the season was shorter than usual. You can blame that on all the writers from the small screen to the big screen for going on strike for three months, which ended shutting down the production on not only ""Desperate Housewives"", but all shows on television. And that was kind of a bummer, because a few more storylines had to be cut short. For example, there was a very funny storyline involving a gay male couple that moved to Wisteria Lane, and I think the writers originally had planned to expand this storyline throughout the season. But after the writer's strike ended and there was only room for seven episodes, the writers couldn't expand this storyline has they had planned. Whether or not this storyline will be expanded for season five remains to be seen.

And when season five debuts in the fall of 2008, it'll be interesting to see what will be going on. In the final moments of the last episode of season four, the action flash forwards to five years later, which I presume is where the show will pick up when season five starts. And it'll be interesting to see what's going on, because ""Desperate Housewives"" leaves us dangling with another bizarre cliffhanger: who's the man (and it's not Mike) that's kissing Susan in the final scene?",1211328000,34,5444,4.919477693144723
3417028,5,B0018CWEYO,"This is ""Desperate Housewives"" at its best. This season extended all the expectations and turned the series back to its roots in great fashion. The newest cast addition Dana Delaney is one of the smartest choices that Marc Cherry ever did. The season is great filled with juicy secrets, dramatic moments, hilarious jokes and incidents, enthralling mysteries and secrets behind closed doors.

Season 4 is, by far, the best of the three last seasons (for me it is the best season of the show, but some will say that the first is always the best). With a great start, and an amazing conclusion (that will change the series completely in a shocking way), this DVD is a must-have for any fan and newcomer. Buy it!",1211241600,5,708,4.664
3417029,3,B0018CWEYO,"We all know the story of how Desperate Housewives turned from a must-watch Sunday night event to a mediocre inconsistent over-the-top suburban bloodbath with a body count that rivals NBC's crime shows. After the first seasons groundbreaking finale concerning a depressed suburban mother who would do anything to protect her child, 30 million viewers wondered how the shows second season would turn out. Would it be another shocking, well-written, groundbreaking season on Wisteria Lane, or merely another failed attempt to surpass the first? Season 2 of Desperate Housewives premiered, and from the second the first episode of the new season finished, there was a groan heard around America. Some fans waited to see if the show got better, which it did after 10 shaky episodes, but all in all 5 million viewers left and creator Marc Cherry got criticism from every critic in television for letting the quality sink and promised things would return to normal for the shows third season.

Season three started out fresh and clean. The first episode was rather good, but then followed a few mediocre ones and then 'Bang', the seventh episode of the third season that won back a few million more viewers, and America once again fell in love with the Housewives. Right when the third season took a break, we were greeted with Orson's once missing and presumed dead ex-wife, Alma, and we were once again sucked in, hoping the third season would continue on this ascending scale and provide more twists and turns for the seemingly simple mystery concerning Orson's dead mistress and Alma's disappearance.

When the third season returned, Marcia Cross became noticeably more pregnant and could only finish 4 more episodes. The mystery, and Marcia Cross, two of the biggest reasons Desperate Housewives remains a hit, were forced to end quickly and thus we were left with 7 episodes with really no purpose. Many people were disappointed by Desperate Housewives' once again declining quality. I stayed around because I thought despite the changes and difficulties, Cherry and co. did the best they could with  what they were given. It was also a very unexpected insight that I hope Cherry and co. realized that the show *needs* a stable mystery and Marcia Cross. Without it, Desperate Housewives is just another soap with a few comedic moments. The darker satirical tone of the first season is gone, and what we're left with is sitcom-like humor that has changed this show from a dark and funny one to just another slapstick comedy with obvious jokes and obnoxious music cues.

As usual, Cherry promised a better season, this time with more Housewife interaction, more scandal, and better storylines. The fourth season of Desperate Housewives premiered September 30th, and with that being said...

The set-up:

After Edie seemingly ended her life in the season three finale, Mary Alice explains that Edie did not intend to die, rather she was staging a suicide to get Carlos to stay with her. The only man Edie should be seeing is Doctor Phil for severe co-dependency issues, but more on that later. After almost letting her die in a darkly comedic fashion, Carlos saves his needy ex-girlfriend and takes her to the hospital...

Meanwhile, Gabrielle's plan to sneak away with Carlos has been thwarted, so she is forced to remain in a loveless relationship with corrupt politician, Victor Lang. Bree is continuing to pretend to be pregnant to save Danielle's reputation (which was a thankless task), Lynette tries to hide her cancer from her friends, and Susan... is again... just there.

Meanwhile, Katherine Mayfair, Susan's old neighbor from 12 years ago returns after an extended departure, but there's something awfully strange going on in that family. Julie, Susan's inquisitive daughter, says that there's something very wrong with Dylan, as she doesn't remember her, or anything about herself for that matter. Meanwhile, Katherine and Adam have a brief conversation about something terrible that happened in Dylan's old room that ""she can't remember"". Seeing as though Desperate Housewives does not dwell into supernatural elements (and if it does, then asta la vista!), there's not really too many sensible reasons to explain Dylan's memory loss except for maybe some brain trauma, drugging, or maybe... as Julie suggested, Dylan isn't really Dylan?

The mystery-

I preferred this mystery to last years because it for once, did not focus on a murder. Instead, a seemingly puzzling question about Katherine's parenting. Unfortunately, the writers made this one much too obvious, as you could have guessed the outcome at end of the first episode. Still, other questions concerning Adam's secret in Chicago and what role Aunt Lilly played in this whole equation slowly unfold, and by episode 11 the answer stares you in the face. By the finale, everything is spelled out for you in a pivotal flashback, like all the other seasons, and everything is crystal clear. The outcome is pretty dark and twisted. I won't spoil it for those awaiting the DVD release, but it probably the saddest storyline Desperate Housewives has ever come up with. It's creepy and gothic, but at the same time human and plausible. This was the most realistic mystery the show has dealt with so far, and its only downfall was its predictability.

The housewives-

Lynette- This season mind as well be renamed as the ""let's torture Lynette show"". Everything bad that you can imagine happening to her has. She has developed cancer and is going through chemotherapy for the first 6 episodes. After recovering, an incredibly random tornado reeks havoc on Wisteria Lane, and after surviving Lynette tries to better herself. While this is happening, Kayla Scavo, Nora's devil of a daughter devises one of the most evil plans an 11-year-old could come up with, and after getting Lynette framed for a crime I won't mention (don't want to spoil it), Tom finally gets a backbone and decides that the sociopathic gene skipped a generation and manifested in Kayla's evil head. Thus, she gets the boot.

Susan- After 3 years of off and on romance, Mike Delfino and Susan finally marry. Susan discovers she's pregnant, and her and Mike... do their usual routine. Mike becomes addicted to pain killers, and after hitting rock bottom by assulting a doctor, takes himself to rehab. While this is happening, Orson confesses he's the one who made Mike roadkill and instead of beating his lights out, Mike takes a very zen approach to life and after Susan gives birth to Maynard (the worst name EVER), her and Mike are finally, seemingly happy.

Bree- After hilariously getting away with pretending to be pregnant, Bree adopts baby Benjamin for her own. She also tries to make nice with Katherine, her rival but after trying to sabotage eachother decide that maybe they could in fact be very good friends. Her and Katherine start catering, and form a bond. After two very useless characters, a gay couple named Bob and Lee (their personalities are as boring as their names) move in Bree and Katherine agree to cater their wedding unaware of the dangers that present itself in the finale...

Gabrielle- Married to workaholic and control freak Victor Lang, Gabrielle starts an affair with Carlos, her ex-husband. After Edie is shoved to the side, she makes it a personal effort to expose Carlos to get him on Victor's bad side. Gabrielle and Carlos dispose of Victor, or so they think, and when he returns unharmed (minus the sunburn), vows revenge on the both of them. This is very conveniently resolved in the very random natural disaster on episode 9, and Gabrielle is now remarried to Carlos, but there's a catch- he's blinded by the storm. Gabrielle, struggling with a blind husband, enlists some help, a new tenant named Ellie who deals drugs. This was the best storyline between the Solis' in quite some time, I liked how the integrated Gabrielle's friendship with Ellie as a motive to keep her safe. This was very real, despite how farfetched her other storylines have gotten.

What they did right-

*The mystery
*The new characters. Season 3's characters were mostly obnoxious, but I actually really liked Katherine's family.
*The first 3 episodes were great! Unfortunately, the quality declined. Episodes 11, 15, 16, and 17 were pretty good too.
*The body count (minus episode 9) was appropriate. This is Wisteria Lane, not the Bronx, and still more people die on this street than your most rundown ghetto in Detroit.
*The villian. Wayne was a great psychopath.

What they need to work on-

*New ideas. I seriously think this shows biggest downfall is the lack of creativity. Every year there's a new murder, a new mystery, and new neighbor, a new love interest for Susan, and the same old drama between Carlos and Gabrielle.
*The tornado. Seriously... it looked fake, it was fake. Just a ratings ploy, and a sell-out moment.
*The humor. I was never very fond of the sitcom tone the show adopted last year. What happened to the dark satire?
*The music cues. Why does every scene have to sound like a musical? It's very annoying, except for the dramatic or mysterious tones.
*The consistency. This show is never consistent, whether it's the quality, relationships, humor, everything.
*More Edie. I think we all love Nicollette's suburban diva.

What they need to drop-

*The 5-year-jump. From the second I heard of it, I thought it was terrible. Seeing the last 3 minutes of the finale, my opinion hasn't changed. Personally, I can't even buy it because everything looks so 2008. There will be so many technological advances in 2013 and changes elsewhere. I just can't buy the timeline. It was a huge red flag that the writers are out of ideas and ruined an otherwise good finale.
*Hostages. We get it. How many times have they played that card?
*Carlos being blind. I still don't get the motivation for this... can't he and Gabrielle have a decent storyline?
*What's the point of Bob and Lee? They're useless and are only used for bad cliche gay jokes. I say, either make them important and interesting, or give them the boot and give Betty's old house to someone more interesting.

Seeing where season five is going, I doubt I will watch it, but we'll have to wait until September to see how this show will sink. I seriously doubt any good will come of this, but I'm going to give them a chance to prove me wrong.",1211155200,6,10371,4.9312320916905446
3417030,4,B0018CWEYO,"After last season all is revealed such as Eddie's fate. This season was pretty good but i felt the season was sort of rushed, although that's to be expected because of the shortened season. As in every season a neighbor who we've never seen before has a dark past and an even darker secrete. This time it's Katherine, who the women already know because she used to live on Wisteria Lane but than moved. She comes back with a new husband and her daughter who can't rember her past.
This season Susan and Mike are finally married and are expecting a child. However pressure gets to Mike and he starts to take drugs and needs to go into rehabilitation.
Gabriel falls in love with Carlos again even though she just got married. Eddie starts to try and steal Carlos's money, but so is Gabriel. Later Carlos goes blind.
Lynett is dealing with her cancer and her mother. She also has to deal with Kayla who is becoming much more dangerous. Also Lynett deals with Rick building a new restaurant right across from her's, and Tom doesn't like it.
Bree is faking preganancy for her daughter and at the same time competes against Katherine for being the beest cook until they finally decide to work together. Also Orson's secrete that he's been keeping since the end of season 2 comes out and Bree is mortified.
This is a good season for what it's worth. Stil not as good as season one. Better than season 2. And on the same leve as season 3. Some features are, Getting Desperate From Beginning To End. A Behind-the-Scenes Look at the "" Tornado "" episode. Couples Commentary. The Men Of Wisteria Lane reveal their own secrets. Deleted Scenes. Bloopers.

I almost didn't buy this season after reading other reviews that season 5 did not measure up to other seasons.  I personally thought season 5 was one of the best seasons.

Yes, it's been about five years since it aired, but I think it's one of the better ones. All the ladies of Wisteria Lane have their own storylines, and they are some of the better ones of the series's eight year run. Susan has just married Mike, and they have their own share of problems, Bree is trying to cover up her daughter's pregnancy as her own, Gabby is newly married to Victor, the mayor, but still has feelings for Carlos, and then later in the season has to learn how to deal with being the one in charge of her home, and Lynette, well, she's battling cancer, and later her seriously psychotic step-daughter.

3417127,5,B0018CWEYO,"What I love most about Desperate Housewives is that every season gets better.  Season 4 does not disappoint in the least!

My husband refuses to watch most television shows because they simply don't keep his interest.  This show has him wandering into whatever room I'm watching it in and sitting down with me, asking questions about the plots and really getting into the story lines.  It blows me away, especially since the longest time ago he used to criticize me for wanting to watch a show titled ""Desperate Housewives.""

Marcia Cross (Bree), to me, stole the show this season. Her quips and slyness always leave me rolling with laughter.  She has a certain level of polish all her own, and she only gets more amazing with every show.

This cast is one of the most synergistic I've ever seen yet.  I watch all of the bonus material that comes with the DVDs and it's wonderful to see how much they enjoy working together.  Hooray for Desperate Housewives!",1296604800,,958,4.688622754491018
3417128,5,B0018CWEYO,"Although I loved the first three seasons, I think this season of Desperate Housewives is the best so far.

Especially for these reasons:

1. Dana Delany: She is an excellent addition to the show and her mystery was captivating. And its revelations throughout the season were better balanced than in the sixth season. Not only that, she gets to play with Nathan Fillion, who is just marvelous as her new husband. When you see those two act together, you really get to see that they have great chemistry.

2. The charade episode: For once, all the main characters are reunited in a big evening of charades. That involves lots of interactions and conflicts between the characters and it reminds to us that Wisteria Lane's residents get to meet and have fun when they are not trying to find each others' secrets or cleaning their dirty laundry.

3. The tornado episode: An episode that not only gave a sense of drama for the series, but also gave way to lots of high production values, with its special effects and dramatic cliffhanger.

4. Rick Coletti and Kayla: A conclusion to a half-solved storyline from last season, but which opened the way to another character's revenge on Lynette Scavo, whom she believes is responsible for the death of her mother. Wonder if we'll ever hear or see more of Kayla in the next seasons.

5. Bob and Lee: A new couple on the street. Funny and great to watch! Wonder if we'll ever get to see a mystery of them.

6. Halloween episode: Mix Oingo Boingo's music in a Halloween party, Susan Mayer's first meeting with her father-in-law, Danielle Van De Kamp's Halloween costume and what do you get = A great Halloween episode.

7. Making of bonus: The authors reveals to us how they did the hurricane episode, including how they managed to do their visual effects and soundtrack. They even said that it took them the double of time they did to shoot an episode, which is normally ten days.

7. Actors commentaries bonus: Each couple on the street gets to give their comments: The most funniest was Eva and Ricardo's, who are like brother and sister when they talk. The most pleasant to see was Marcia and Kyle's for you could definitely see that they are not the compulsive perfectionists that their characters are. Why, they even had difficulty trying to find out what to say for their commentary. As they shot this episode's commentary, you could even hear some trucks that were working on the Wisteria Lane set for the second part of the tornado episode, where everything is in ruins.

8. Edie Britt: Still as mischievous as ever. Even more as she uncovered one of Carlos Solis' secret's, which is his offshore account in the Cayman islands. Something that had been introduced in the first season,  but was never fully solved.

9. Writers strike: Instead of having 23 or 24 episodes per season ( which means 16 or 17 interesting episodes with 6 or 7 episodes with secondary plots that could have been used in later seasons, considering what happens in seasons 5 and 6), we got 17 episodes. This gave more concise and better structured plotlines and everything moved along to a great rhythm. Nothing seemed to drag on like in the following seasons. That strike definitely confirmed to me that shows that work with plotlines that stretch over several episodes should not have the same number of episodes as in sitcoms or Law and Order shows, who have in general one plotline per episode. Even the creators of Lost understood this and this made their series shorter, but with better scripts than if they had had too much episodes.

In short, Desperate Housewives was at its peak with this season. And maybe should have ended there.",1292976000,,3661,4.7015625
3417129,4,B0018CWEYO,"The item was listed as ""like new"" but it really wasn't in a ""like new"" condition. The discs played fine and the product was in good condition, but the casing was obviously worn and tearing in places. All in all, however, the product served its purpose just fine.",1292371200,,262,4.479166666666667
3417130,5,B0018CWEYO,"Maybe season one is the best yet, but my personal favorite is season four, since it introduced who would become my favorite housewife.

Season four opens with the aftermath of season three's season finale story arcs. Susan and Mike just got married, Bree is pretending to be pregnant to cover-up Danielle's pregnancy, Lynette discovered she has cancer and Gaby married Victor, oh yeah, and Edie's intent of suicide.

But also on season four's premiere an old neighbor moves back to Wisteria Lane, she used to live there 12 years ago back when only Susan, Mary Alice and Mrs. Mccluskey lived there, her name is Katherine Mayfair, previously known as Katherine Davis. Katherine moves back to Wisteria Lane with her now teenage daughter Dylan and new husband Adam Mayfair (Nathan Fillion) The Mayfairs are this season's ""mystery"", that involves sexual harassment a daughter that can't remember anything regarding her childhood and a possible murder.",1274918400,,946,5.176470588235294
3417131,5,B0018CWEYO,"Make no mistake: this show is basically a glorified soap opera, with much better acting and plots. However, it is pretty funny. The plots get so off the wall sometimes that it becomes hilarious. Each season has a separate story arch that usually involves a murder or somebody's deep, dark secret. Each episode also features a unique story and many plot twists. Things get pretty zany after several seasons. Over the past 5 years, it has included many (many) extramarital affairs, murders, holdups, hurricanes, gang lords, and dead bodies in the freezer. All of which makes for some entertaining TV.",1271548800,,598,4.99

The story lines are sharp the actors and actresses are spot on and it brings back the anticipation and excitement I feel were lost in Season 3 possibly due to a few new unlikable characters.

Dylan and Julie Myer used to be friends when Dylan lived on Wisteria Lane, they pick up where they left off but there is something different about Dylan (especially considering she can't remember living on Wisteria Lane when she moved when she was 6) Dylan wants to find her father and enlist Julie to help her, but when he shows up it becomes apparent why Dylan can  not remember living on Wisteria Lane.

Gabby Solis is courted by Victor Lang who is the Mayor of Fairview They get married, but soon Gabby is in the arms of her ex Carlos and then tries to hide her affair from her new husband.

Carlos Solis had been having an affair with Edie Britt, but soon after a  fight about them starting a family he is in the arms of his ex Gabby who had just got married.

Susan Myer had been involved with Brit Ian and was about to get married to him before her ex boyfriend Mike Delfino regained the memory he had lost in a car accident. Soon she could not make up her mind, but after Ian broke up with her she and Mike got married and she soon found out that she was pregnant.

Bree Hodge just got back from a honeymoon with her new husband Orson and she is pregnant, so so her friends think. It turns out that she is just pretending to be pregnant because she is protecting her teenage daughter Danielle who is pregnant. She has a hard time keeping the secret and when Danielle comes back it is even harder. Edie (the baby's great aunt) soon finds out and blackmails Bree who is forced to tell the whole story to her friends (and leads to this seasons mystery with Edie's new hubby)

Then there is Lynette Scavo who finds out that she has cancer and also has to deal with her wicked step-daughter who tries to make her life difficult

The storylines all come together in the last episode when a tornado comes down on Wisteria Lane.

What is the reason Dylan can not remember living on Wisteria Lane? What happens to Gabby, Carlos, Lynette, Susan, and Bree watch the fourth season of Desperate Housewives",1226102400,,2243,4.4092009685230025

3417156,4,B0018CWEYO,"There's little else to add to what others have said of the season itself. Instead, I wanted to note the great extras that make this DVD set a nice buy. Several are of the same type as previous season sets:

There are audio commentaries for six episodes, the first by Marc Cherry and some writers with nice tidbits (season 3 was to end with the revelation of Bree faking her pregnancy but ABC didn't think that was dramatic enough so they came up with Edie's ""Hanging""). The other five are ""Couple commentaries"" with nice banter between the actors and some fun stuff (like Marcia Cross marveling at how her cleveage was so big early in the season).

""Desperate From Beginning to End"" looks at the creation of an episode, this one the tornado ep. It notes what a challenge it was with all the stunts and special effects work and how amazed they were ABC let them destory the set like that. It's a great insight to how they created the amazing story.

Hanging with the Men of Wisteria Lane"" has the male actors bowling and sharing stories about the show.

""Cherry Picked"" are Marc Cherry's half-dozen favorite scenes from the season.

There are also a dozen deleted scenes, many filler but some interesting and fun. This includes the alternate ending for the season finale and it's clear that Cherry made the right move changing it.

So overall, great extras flesh the season out and make this rebounding series back on its game.",1224979200,4,1426,4.616600790513834

3417162,5,B0018CWEYO,"I adore Desperate Housewives.  Season 1 was phenomenal, Season 2 was a bit disappointing, but they came back in Season 3.  Cliffhanger after cliffhanger.  Who's doing what?  And to who or with who?  Everone has a dirty little secret they're hiding.

Season 3 ended with a cliffhanger, one that made me catch my breath and clutch my chest.  This season did not end with a cliffhanger that brought out a visable reaction, because a certain secret was not resolved but will continue.  Here Susan is married to Mike and expecting a child.  Lynette is battling cancer and her sociopathic stepchild that her husband fathered years ago.  Edie is still with Carlos, Gabrielle's ex husband, and won't let go.  Gabrielle is married to the major and hates it.  And Bree is faking a pregnancy so she and Orsen will raise the baby (which is really her grandchild) as their own.  The best part of this season was the addition of another housewife, Kathrine.  Kathrine used to live on Wisteria Lane years ago but left under mysterious circumstances.  Now, she has returned with a new husband and her daughter.  It becomes clear from the beginning that Kathrine is also hiding a deep, dark secret.  The only words of criticism are that whatever circumstances that lead to Kathrine's sudden departure were, it was not uncovered.  Instead, the mystery deepens with the discovery of new facts.  But they haven't lost their edge yet!  Wisteria Lane is certainly becoming more and more juicy as time goes on.",1224115200,,1487,4.825396825396825

3417165,5,B0018CWEYO,"I collect this series on Dvd rather than watch each episode on tv.  This gives the story much more continuity and helps keep the story fresh in your mind.
I find this series to be so well written, blending comedy with mystery and intrigue, that you find yourself laughing at the one liners as much as guessing at the series subplots.  The fourth season doesn't disappoint.  It maintains the high quality of story line and dialogue that has made this series a winner for a long time.  New characters and story lines are seemlessly introduced and absorbed into the Wysteria hysteria with a blend of mystery, seasoned with a dash of humor.  There's always a synister mystery brewing under the madcap lives of these truely desperate, but lovable women.  It reminds me a little of Twin Peaks, the way the writers juggles mystery and absurdity with ribbons of out-loud laughs stirred in for a tasty recipe for sucessful television.
If you already are a fan, season 4 does not fail to deliver.  If only movie sequels would be this consistantly good.",1223251200,2,1042,4.723756906077348

3417175,4,B0018CWEYO,"Desperate Housewives is back, and a season four seems to be a bit hotter than previous runs. This year, the Emmy Award-winning ladies of Wisteria Lane bump things up a level, in everything from steamy sexiness to claw-sharpening drama, and a long walk down the dark side of suburban life.

The biggest news of the season is the return of an old resident of the neighborhood, Katherine Mayfair (played fabulously wickedly by Dana Delaney), who can't seem to escape from her abusive past. Of course the primetime soap explores her relationship with current residents, while all the while plenty of additional drama is swirling around like a twisted tornado. In a nutshell, Susan (Teri Hatcher) becomes unexpectedly pregnant, Bree (Marcia Cross) pretends to be pregnant so that she can then raise her teenage daughter's expected child as her own, Lynette's (Felicity Huffman) cancer is causing problems in her marriage and friendships, and the battle between Edie (Nicollette Sheridan) and Gabrielle (Eva Longoria) over Carlos (Ricardo Antonio Chavira) sinks to even lower lows.

Of course all this drama is deliciously twisted, catty, and addictive- and if you haven't seen the controversial time-jumping season finale ""Free,"" you best run out and buy this set now, or be forced to give up your gay card.

SPECIAL FEATURES

Finicky fans will be happy to know that Disney didn't skimp on extras in this five-disc set. Getting Desperate From beginning to End was much more interesting- and entertaining- that I expected, as viewers step onto Wisteria Lane and discover how an episode of the show is made- from concept to completion. Aside from getting a peak into the women's hair, makeup, and wardrobe transformations, we're also given exclusive access to a casting session, see the writers in action, and learn how they pulled off the special effects in the powerful season finale.

Not quite as riveting and a bit cheese-ball, the Couples Commentary feature is billed as a way for viewers to ""get to know the real people behind the characters."" In reality, it's a somewhat interesting series of sessions with most of the onscreen couples as they talk about their favorite moments from Season Four.

I got excited when I saw that one of the special features was titled The Men of Wisteria Lane, and even more so when I saw that it involved filming the sexy guys as they spent a night in a bowling alley in Hollywood. Unfortunately this wasn't a slumber party- at least not as I fantasized- but rather a ""guy's night out"" with the neighborhood men shooting the breeze and ""revealing secrets"" of the show, and a bit of their personal lives.

Of course there's the standard Deleted Scenes and Bloopers, all of which deserve watching, and some of the latter ranking up there with the best.

If you love the show or you've never seen it, you owe it to yourself to pick up Season Four. It's a knockout, and a piece of gay history!",1221696000,,2922,4.865191146881288
3417176,1,B0018CWEYO,"We all know this show is simply awesome... but seriously what is with the price? $38.99? For what?  Past seasons have sold at the same price, BUT they had 20+ episodes.

3417179,4,B0018CWEYO,"In season 4 of DH we see the show going back to the basics, to the thing that made fans love DH: the friendships. The friendships of Lynette, Susan, Bree and Gabrielle, as well as each individual character, were tested over and over again and they endured. It was this quality of enduring friendship amongst women that makes this show so good.

Season 4 takes another route and shows the women provide each other a strong support system. Lynette relies on her friends and family to go through cancer, Bree deals with faking a pregnancy, Susan must deal with her marriage with Mike and Gabrielle must decide between Carlos and Victor.

We also see the introduction of another character, Katherine Mayfair (and of course, her many secrets which deserve to be a character all of their own). She was such an excellent character that I instantly liked her, secrets and all. Katherine was a former resident of Wisteria Lane and a friend of Susan's. She has a ton of secrets and a way to challenge each and everyone of our Wisteria Lane ladies.

Tornadoes, blackmail (tons of blackmail), ex-husbands, drugs, maniacs, and tons of humor. This is one of the best DH seasons to date.",1216771200,8,1463,5.297413793103448
