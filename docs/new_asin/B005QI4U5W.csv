Granted most of their movies are either about cheating on someone or a ridiculous idea gone wrong, but that is the whole point! Not everything has to be serious! These movies are just meant to make people laugh! I had NO ISSUES with any of the five movies and they came RIGHT ON TIME! Even at my age I know that I probably will not be able to enjoy many of their movies in the near future just because they are getting older. So ENJOY THIS SET WHILE YOU STILL CAN!",1486598400,,580,4.008620689655173
