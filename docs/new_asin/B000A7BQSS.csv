2377592,5,B000A7BQSS,"This is my top ""to buy"" workout!  Not only is it a great timesaver working out at home, but its fun, too!  I noticed a difference after doing this 4x a week for 2 weeks.  My hips trimmed down, although what's tough is staying on it 4x a week!",1163030400,10,242,3.8979591836734695
2377593,4,B000A7BQSS,"I wasn't expecting much from this DVD, but it was surprisingly pretty good! I did the routine last night and my buns are hurting today! It's not a killer workout, but it seems effective. I like the fact that they mix a bit of aerobics (warm out), kickboxing, toning with weights (mainly squats), and yoga stretches. I think they cold have done the yoga part a bit more challenging.... overall it's an ok DVD for lighter days. I see myself doing this one when I feel kind of lazy!",1152835200,11,479,4.393258426966292
2377594,3,B000A7BQSS,"I really like Violet Zaki, and enjoy her Self Firm Flat Abs DVD, but I am less impressed with this one.  They jump right into the kickboxing moves without any explanation on how to do them, and run through them so quickly it's very hard to figure out how to do the move properly if you're new to kickboxing.  About half of the workout is kickboxing, so if you're new to it or don't/can't do it, you're going to miss out.",1143331200,12,420,4.172839506172839
2377595,4,B000A7BQSS,"This DVD was pretty good. I bought it after I'd gotten the ""Slim & Sleek Fast,"" with Ellen Barrett as the trainer. The lady on this one is Austrailian I think, so there was a bit of difficulty at first understanding her. Overall, the routine is effective, but the trainer isn't as good as Ellen.",1140998400,6,295,4.381818181818182
2377596,4,B000A7BQSS,"This 45 minute workout is led by Violet Zaki, she is joined by two female exercisers, one who shows beginning or low impact modifications.  They are exercising on a beach with the ocean just behind them.  All you need is a pair of 2-5 lb weights and a mat if you don't have carpet.

This workout is split up into sections, kickboxing where you will do front, back and roundhouse kicks, then you will grab your weights and do some squats and various lunges (front, rear and side some adding leg lifts).  Then there is a dance inspired section where you will do plies, standing leg lifts to the side, rear and diagonal in various tempos, finally you will do some yoga poses such as downward facing dog, 3 point pose, chair pose and tree pose.

You finish out on the floor where you will do a very brief bridgework segment before going into the cooldown and stretch.  There is also a brief bonus routine that Violet leads all by herself.

This isn't a bad routine, it has a nice variety although some of the moves seemed a bit uncomfortable to me.  Such as the side lunges into leg lifts, which could be modified into a 4 count move rather than adding the leg lift.  Also during the kickboxing segment the roundhouse kicks are performed quite fast as they do 3 kicks in a row, I modified this and did 2 knee lifts and 1 roundhouse kick instead which felt more comfortable.  Violet Zaki is a black belt in martial arts and has good form and can execute these well, but not all of us are as experienced as she is.

This workout is beginner/intermediate level, although I wouldn't recommend for complete beginners as there are some tricky moves in here that one can injure themselves doing if they do it incorrectly.  There isn't any instruction on most of the moves, they just go right into it.  For those more experienced, this workout isn't very challenging but is nice for something a little different.  Violet Zaki does a good job in this video, plus she has a set of abs that I wouldn't mind having either. Overall I give this one three and half stars.",1132444800,42,2052,4.437333333333333
2377597,3,B000A7BQSS,"I gave this one a few trys since I really wanted to like it. These Self DVDs always seem to hook me with their covers. This one did not really feel that it was going to bring about the changes I am looking for. I have some of their other workouts and honestly I don't really feel they do that much either. But then, I am already pretty fit so maybe for someone just starting out they would be okay.",1132012800,5,398,3.9875
2377598,3,B000A7BQSS,"Unfortunately, I went off of the one review that was listed here alone when making the decision to buy this DVD.  Big mistake.  Best Butt Fast offers a variety of exercise moves, all targeted to shape your butt and thigh areas, but when I purchased this I wasn't aware that there was a kickboxing section right after the warm up (I have bad knees and therefore can't stand kickboxing), nor did I realize the yoga component at the end was as lengthy as it was - it takes up almost 20 minutes of this 45 minute workout, and I am not a big yoga fan either.

Overall it is a decent DVD, but I will likely stick with my stability ball workouts and only do various sections of this DVD if that, as the standing floor work is KILLER, and what I'd initially hoped I would find on this DVD when I bought it.  I've read the reviews for Self's Sleek and Slim Fast and will be trying that out.  Best Butt Fast is somewhat decent, I will likely give it some time to see if I can get into the yoga piece - otherwise, I guess I can always re-sell it on e-Bay.",1131667200,21,1044,4.098039215686274
2377599,5,B000A7BQSS,This was a challenging and effective lower body toning workout lead by a good instructor. I liked the variety of exercises and the yoga component at the end. This is a good 40 minute lower body routine to put in a monthly rotation. I would consider it to be intermediate level,1130716800,11,276,4.431372549019608
2377600,4,B000A7BQSS,"Good workout for those over 40 like me.  I am looking to tone these areas and none of the excercises are too diffucult.  She does move very quickly from one move to the next and there is not a break for a drink of water, so keep the remote ready for pause...good for beginners looking to get back into a workout.",1326153600,3,312,4.098360655737705
2377601,5,B000A7BQSS,"I first tried this work out when it was available for streaming on Netflix. I  l o v e d  it! It is a mixture of moves from Yoga and kickboxing plus other exercises that will for sure help you tone your legs and butt, and also help you lose weight.
I was so out of shape that I couldn't finish the first sessions. I was doing it 3 times a week, and saw a great difference in my body and overall weight (I lost 14 pounds using this work out + slim & sleek fast, also from SELF).
I became Violet Zaki's admirer after using her work out. It is so dynamic! I love that it keeps you moving, transitioning from one exercise to another.

If you feel like it is difficult to follow the routines, don't give up! Seriously, I don't have any coordination whatsoever, and after a while I got the hang of the moves and finally was able to do the whole work out. If I can do this, so can you!

Since I love Violet Zaki so much, I had to buy this DVD when they pulled it off the streaming on Netflix. While searching for this on Amazon I found that she has a dvd for the abs. I got that one too and I hope to start really soon, to be in perfect shape for spring next year.",1321920000,2,1157,3.9106382978723406
2377602,4,B000A7BQSS,"First of all I absolutely love this dvd. I work up a sweat every time (and am noticing improvement), and I enjoy the combinations and the fluidity of the routine. Violet Zaki is an excellent instructor and I intend to find another one by her, hopefully just as good. She works you with kickboxing, squats with optional weights (I tend to use 5lb weights), the dance for toning your hips and butt, and then finishes off with yoga. Personally, the yoga bores me, so I stop it there and go straight to the mini ab workout. As she says in the video, if you do the ab workout 2-3 times in a row, you'll get the most out of it. In a nutshell, I have a lot of fun waking up and working out to this DVD, especially because I think it's difficult to find any good ones. It's a great supplement to my bellydance workout DVDs =]",1280016000,,817,4.177215189873418
2377603,5,B000A7BQSS,"I exercised to this video every other day for months. I noticed a BIG improvement in my back side. I was originally watching it on netflex, but when we moved and didn't have internet fast enough to watch on roku any more, I wasn't able to exercise to it for 4 months. I had to purchase it. I'm glad I did, now with my lap top (and the blinds pulled lol) I can kick, jump and literally work my butt off! It took a week to be able to get back up to speed and keep up with the entire video after 4 months off, but it's totally worth it! While working the legs I also get a great medium pace cardio work out!",1279929600,,604,3.879032258064516
2377604,5,B000A7BQSS,I had first received this workout DVD with Netflix.  It was so good - I bought it!  It's about 40 minutes of actual workout.  You will feel the burn!,1259539200,,149,4.068965517241379
2377605,3,B000A7BQSS,This workout was far too simple.  I am out of shape and haven't worked out in months.  I did the whole video and was not sore at all the next day.  I like to really be pushed and feel the burn.  My theory is no pain no gain.,1235692800,,224,3.6041666666666665
2377606,5,B000A7BQSS,"This was the first exercise DVD I ever bought and since then, it is still the best. I have ordered many more Self DVD's and I have to say that they are by far the most conducive to my work out. They are slow paced enough that you don't feel lost, but by the time you are halfway through, you are already EXHAUSTED! This particular DVD is great too because there is a bonus on it, an ab work out, that, when done only three times, produces amazing results. I could recommend this DVD to a beginner or someone advanced. It has techniques that get those hard to work out places, but is easy enough for anyone to do. If you are looking for an amazing lower body work out, this is a perfect DVD to get.",1206403200,2,697,4.094890510948905
2377607,4,B000A7BQSS,"I do this workout 2 times a week and it's awesome! It makes me sweat and I feel sore the day after! The instructor is great but on the leg lunges
the instructor misses a move on one of the legs! But I still would recommend this video! Great for beginners!",1199836800,,255,4.019607843137255
2377608,4,B000A7BQSS,"This is a very good workout that I still do occasionally to this day.  It will give you results if you do it often enough and it's fun to do so there's no problem.
This uses three distinct exercise styles to give shape and burn fat off the three muscle groups within your tush.  The cardio segment is also targeted to that area.  The toning portion has classic lunges and squats with ballet-style plis and relevs.  This whole routine is geared to quickly burn fat and reshape your body.  It's fun to do and motivating each and everytime you look at the stunning beach setting.  That should get you thinking about swimsuit season.  At the end of the dvd is a bonus ab workout that while small, will really help if you always tag it on to the end.
This is really fun to do and enjoyable and before you know it, you've had a great workout that is bound to keep the fat off and tone up some of the major trouble spots we almost all have.",1184284800,6,933,4.207865168539326
2377609,5,B000A7BQSS,This video won't make you sweat but it is a great toning video.  Violet Zacki is a much tougher instructor than Ellen Barret who is in some of the other SELF videos.  This is a great workout for someone who has graduated from the basic workout videos.  I was sore after this video (not even advanced Taebo videos makes me sore),1163462400,9,327,4.327868852459017
