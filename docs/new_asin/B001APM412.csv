3456652,5,B001APM412,"When I first saw the title, I thought that it would be another bad made for T.V. movie, buuuuut. It isn't,  Spoiler alert, The HMS Scorpion was lost at sea in 1943, in the Baltic sea. But in 1981 she resurfaces, with no crew on board. Now British command wants to retrace the scorpion's mission step by step, to find out what happened to her. With one little surprise, there was one survivor of the scorpion. And he comes along for the ride, since he can't remember anything about his final moments aboard. Now what I like about this movie, is you get to see commander Tyler literally go crazy. But they nicely throw in the ghost aspect of the sub and crew, when the scorpion went through the Triangle, the ship remained in 1943. But it's 1981 outside the sub, even the modern day crew, start becoming the original crew, one thing that is done very well is that because the sub is pretty much alive. She starts reliving the mission literally, everything exactly as it happened. When they destroy an enemy sub, it happens exactly when and where it happened in 1943. Some have complained that we don't see enough of the ghosts, but that's what makes this movie better. We get just enough, to make us wanting more. Even when Jack Hardy, the surviving crew member starts having flashbacks. And hearing voices, What makes the movie work, is he's the only one who doesn't slip into 1943. Unlike the rest of the crew, even the ghost of the original captain is dominant in this movie. He makes a brief appearance at the end, all in all. A great movie, that's surprising, Don't let the title fool you.",1372377600,,1592,4.489655172413793
3456653,3,B001APM412,You have to love David Jason to like this movie.  It is an interesting concept but underdeveloped in the movie.,1357603200,,111,4.55
3456654,3,B001APM412,"The plot is just average and seems very similar to an American movie that was out many many years ago.

Sir David Jason is very good but the movie is average.",1303948800,,158,4.096774193548387
3456655,5,B001APM412,"I remember reading this book years ago and thinking it would make a great movie.  I've been looking for it ever since, I've watched every ghost boat, ghost ship, ghost dingy movie that came along.  When I saw this on amazon I bought it on the spot.  I gathered the family and put it in.  We all enjoyed it - which is saying a lot.",1284940800,2,330,4.030769230769231
3456656,4,B001APM412,"""Ghostboat"" was originally written around 1975 as a screenplay.  The writers, George Simpson and Neal Burger, who met in the Trailer (""coming attractions"") editing department at Universal Studios, had a prior screen play, ""The Disappearance of Flight 412"", produced in 1974 as a very successful TV movie starring Glenn Ford.

But the visual effects required for ""Ghostboat"" would have been hugely expensive in 1975, so no studio would commit to the project.  Then their agent had the unexpected opportunity to pitch something, anything, to Dell, and having the ""Ghostboat"" screenplay fresh in his head, he pitched that story.  Dell went for it.  Now George and Neal simply had to turn their screenplay into a novel; the result was a major best-seller.  But no movie deal resulted, so George and Neal moved on, writing four more books over the next decade.  Fade out.

Fade in, many years later.  David Jason is filming an interior fight scene for some TV show or other, the kind of scene where the props department has filled the bookshelves in the room with loads of old books that will be on the floor by the end of the scene.  After finishing the multiple takes necessary to complete the scene, Jason, rather winded, collapsed into a chair on the set to recover.  He noticed the book resting against his foot, liked the cover, picked it up, and began to read.  The book was ""Ghostboat"".  He found he could hardly put the book down, and was enthused enough about the story - and the terrific part he saw for himself in it - that he went to Yorkshire TV and Granada TV and pushed them to adapt the book into a film of some sort.  While it took a couple years of on-again, off-again negotiations and dithering, eventually Yorkshire TV signed on to adapt the book into a two-part miniseries.  The story was re-written to adapt an ""American sub in Japanese waters"" tale to one of ""English sub in the Baltic Sea"".

How do I know all this?  Despite writing a number of moderately successful novels, George and Neal still had to ""keep their day jobs"".  George moved into sound editing for movies, my field, and we met in the late eighties, frequently working together until last year, when George died unexpectedly of a heart attack.  While over time I learned a bit about his early efforts to get ""Ghostboat"" made into a film, and his efforts to buy the rights back many years later when CGI techniques had progressed sufficiently that the story could be filmed at reasonable expense, I never knew the finer details until his agent divulged them at George's memorial service in November of 2009.",1262649600,18,2591,4.70509977827051
3456657,4,B001APM412,"The title almost scared me away from spending my hard-earned bucks on this film and when I popped it into the DVD player I was prepared for 90 minutes of crap. Well, what a surprise! This movie was well-acted, very well filmed and the story-line was ten times better than the title would suggest! It is presently on loan to a friend but I'm looking forward to getting it back so that I can watch it again. If I were Siskel or Ebert I would give it a big 'Thumbs-Up'

3456658,3,B001APM412,"Enjoyable. Not really that thrilling but the plot was decent and the acting was good. Think ""BELOW"" meets ""CRIMSON TIDE"". This is a low budget film and it's broken down into two parts almost as if they were part of a show and they were separate episodes?",1231372800,6,254,4.425531914893617
3456659,4,B001APM412,"I first read the book back in the 70's and thought it would make a great movie. I had thrown the book away and then was able to find it again, even though it was out of print, and read it again in 2002. This movie pretty much follows the book and in some ways goes beyond the book. This movie was done as a mini-series but it was put together great.",1229558400,10,349,3.861111111111111
3456660,4,B001APM412,"Without spoiling this flick I'll say this is kinda of a reverse on Final Countdown.  In this a navel sub from the past goes back to the past for the crew while they're actually still in the early eighties.....Plot flows well and is quite decent for a sci-fi military flick. Also, plot flows on the line of Red October so, that'll tell ya about as much of where this film is going with out giving away the flick....",1223942400,13,414,4.3076923076923075

3456675,2,B001APM412,"Weak plots often kill even the best acting, ""Ghost Boat"" is no exception.  It has so many logic holes, even the continual Deus ex machine segues run out of steam.  If you want me to suspend belief over a haunted submarine with a will of its own, and you've placed a highly trained crew on board, who are operating under Royal Navy supervision, I need a bit more from the script.  I can live with a locker full of .45 Colts for a RN submarine (filming was in Italy and Malta), but it is much more difficult to deal with the anti-Occam's Razor approach to solving every challenge.  This is too bad, as the basic story is interesting, and the actors competent.",1443830400,,657,4.360655737704918

These are both tremendously well done episodes which contain more detail, excitement and thrills than most movies. You will be glued to your chair and compelled to watch the 2nd Episode which completes the movie. A stunningly awesome flick, of which is a ""must watch"" movie/series!

3456689,5,B001APM412,"I bought this because I have become a fan of David Jason from watching the Touch of Frost series and saw this advertised on Amazon.  I found it very suspenseful and watched both episodes at once.  I have always liked submarine movies about WWII, and the history of earlier boats.  If you have never seen DAS BOAT, you really should see that movie also.  It has got to be THE most realistic submarine movie ever made!

After reading some reviews I remembered that I had read this book and enjoyed it
very much. It was among the beginning of my series of many sub books to follow.
I don't agree about the comment on the graphics being bad. I thought they were very decent and keep to a minimum. It's nice to watch a movie where the plot doesn't depend on computer graphics, lots of explosions and vulgar language.
I thought the acting was excellent and the plot moved along to where I didn't realize that over 2 hrs had gone by.

I recommend this movie to anyone that likes a good supernatural story.",1378080000,,652,4.433333333333334
