8588266,5,B00D0XHGTW,"One of Bunuel s overlooked gems. A rare film with a great cast and stunning photography. This dvd edition is really good for the format with enough picture clarity as to allow the viewer to enjoy Gabriel Figueroa and Bunuel s work with lights, shadows, and space. Muy especial para las personas que se interesan en la poltica latinoamericana.",1433635200,,342,4.813559322033898
8588267,3,B00D0XHGTW,"Not particularly noteworthy, but it does picture what the experience of Latin America has been with its dictators. There was some hope lately that democracy was taking finally a toehold there, but the number of strong men now in power in several countries does not augur a favorable political future for the region. The new kind of powerholders do seem a little more sophisticated: they hold elections and do not get rid of opponents so easily!",1429401600,,444,4.855263157894737
