8760549,3,B01F9KQ7BQ,"Right up to the end, I was a fan of End of Days, Inc. It had an interesting take on an interesting concept; I liked the characters and I liked the actors - they did a very good job of selling me on the movie's mixture of desperation, greed, fear, and surrealism. I especially loved the villains, with their mixture of implacable, bureaucratic evil and inept attempts at ""hooman"" social rituals. They know all your dark little secrets but somehow never learned that duck-duck-goose is not a party game for adults, and I find that most amusing. This movie let me down in two places - the exposition of the bad guys' purpose/motives/etc, and the end, which seems trite compared to the build-up that came before it. I would have liked a clearer picture of who the villains were, who they worked for, and why they were doing what they were doing. I'd especially like to know if the closing of Global Inventory was a part of the plan, or if it kicked off the plan as a sort of emergency fall-back. The former would make more sense, but the latter would be in keeping with the story's identity as a black comedy and with the duality of the villains.
Still, I'd say it was worth the watch.",1473120000,2,1181,4.422018348623853
