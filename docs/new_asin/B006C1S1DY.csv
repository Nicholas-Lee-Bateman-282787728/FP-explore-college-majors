4983125,5,B006C1S1DY,"Nice historical action piece centered about the Korean short bow and arrow of the Joseon (Yi) Dynasty as used to defend against Manchurian Qing invasions from the north. The storyline is centered about one of the female captives, Ja-In (Jaihn), and the attempts to rescue her by her brother and husband. Great detail and authenticity in scene, set, props and costume creation. Superb acting by the entire cast. Superb cinematography especially with the remote running and riding scenes. Use of the bow was emphasized with little in the way of martial arts action that we typically find in this genre. The bow scenes on horseback, by parallel to US viewers, had that classical western movie look.",1330560000,2,695,5.0
4983126,4,B006C1S1DY,"I have not delved into too many Korean movies, but they seem to be making an uprising.  My first experience was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Daytime-Drinking/dp/B002UOMGVK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Daytime Drinking</a>, followed by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sword-With-No-Name/dp/B00576U9HQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sword With No Name</a>.  Since this movie was roughly the same time period as Sword with No Name, I thought it might be a similar production.  And while the costume and scenery are similar, IMO this movie was much more enjoyable.

You can read the premise above, so I won't go back through that.  But this particular film gives the viewer enough background to make them care about the three main protagonists (The Brother, Sister and her Fianc).  Each of them has to come to grips in their own way with what is going on around them.  Invasion and kidnapping make the Brother pick up a cause to fight for something.  The Sister will not simply just let herself be captured and finds her own rebellious strength. And her Fianc, who has lived a life of luxury and relative ease, is now forced to meet danger and anxiety head on to get his betrothed back from the enemy camp.

There are very few slow points in this movie and even when the action is ensuing, you still get a sense of story.  During the fights, nothing seems disrupted or out of place, which is wonderful when the viewer wants to hold on to the REASON this is all going on, and not just focus on the battle itself.

Glad to see some attention paid to other weapons of the time.  It was refreshing to see how the ""shoot-outs"" came to a conclusion.  If you're a fan of foreign action films, period films, or just want something a little different, give this one a look. I doubt you'd be disappointed.",1330300800,3,1874,5.248322147651007
4983127,5,B006C1S1DY,"Having been bored by the deluge of recent overseas period action films, I was surprised and delighted by WAR OF THE ARROWS, an experience less interested in plodding political history and more consumed with delivering a frantic, violence-soaked chase movie.  Just stay away from the dubbed track!",1330041600,3,296,5.297872340425532
4983128,5,B006C1S1DY,"I have to agree with the others here that this film is amazing.  For anyone that didn't like Red Cliff (I'm one) you should give this a try.  This film easily could have been a disaster if not done right.  Everything works from the story, acting and direction.  The story reminded me a little of The Naked Prey where a man is trying to get home and is attacked every inch of the way.  It had me hooked all the way to the shocking end.  Do yourself a favor and check it out.

Also look for The Man From Nowhere, another excellent film from Korea.",1329868800,6,545,4.133333333333334
4983129,5,B006C1S1DY,"Loved this from the beginning to finale, what a thrill ride once the action got started. The use of the bow and arrow in this film was given the birds eye view, you are able to see the arrows in action, and had spectacular action sequences that did not let up,don't want to give any of this gem away,see it for yourself, a good Saturday night flick.",1328659200,4,349,4.223880597014926
4983130,4,B006C1S1DY,"""You're now Ja-in's father, you must take care of your sister until you die."" After getting into an argument with his sisters fianc Nam-Yi leaves his village before her wedding. When he returns he is told of the attack and kidnapping of his sister and sets out with his bow to get her back and exact revenge. As many of you may know I have never really been a big fan of these epic martial arts type movies. There have been a few I liked but not many. This one may be the best one I have seen since ""Hero"". This movie grabs you from the opening scene and is action packed and keeps you interested the entire time. The story and action are very well done and there is not a dull moment in this at all. There are some very brutal scenes in this but it's not over the top at all and it helps the story. For fans of this genre this is a must see. For those like me who can go either way this is still a movie that is very much worth watching. Overall, one of the best of this genre I have seen. I give it an A.",1328054400,96,1006,3.9121951219512194
4983131,5,B006C1S1DY,"This movie was 2011 Top movie in Korea. I had a chance to watch on the plane. Wow. Couldn't believe it was made by Korea. Perfect script, laser-like camera walk, actions, acting... can't take my eyes off from the little screen for 2 hours. Just did pre-order to watch on big screen.

True advance of Korean Cinema. I am proud of it! If you like an epic drama of a hero like ""Gladiator"" with Oriental touch, this movie is for you.",1326844800,8,429,4.296296296296297
4983132,5,B006C1S1DY,"Set during the second Manchu invasion of Korea, a lethal archer goes up against the Qing Dynasty to save his younger sister who was dragged away by invaders.  Fans of kick-ass archery will be in heaven here.  Both the protagonist and the antagonists use bows and arrows almost exclusively.  The pacing is very fast, with the entire second half consisting of a footchase/shootout in a forest.  Most of the action is grounded and realistic, with a few exceptions.  Acting is solid too.  Very exciting and totally entertaining.",1326067200,152,524,4.9655172413793105

4983184,4,B006C1S1DY,"Released in 2011, War of the Arrows is set during the second Manchu invasion of Korea where Korean Nam Yi, an expert archer, pursues the Manchurians to save his younger sister Ja-In, who was dragged off by the invaders.

The tone is akin to 2006 Apocalypto and, while the plots are similar, the protagonist in War of the Arrows is the hunter rather than the escapee; not to mention his loved ones have been captured by the enemy and torn from their homes, not hidden somewhere near their village. Imagine the excellent TV series Vikings, but with way more action and set in 17th century Korea.

This is a top-of-the-line adventure/action flick with awesome forest cinematography, superb costuming, effective score, convincing acting and consistent thrills. All you have to do is persevere through the first half hour and then its non-stop-thrills from there. There are some flaws, like the villagers being wholly surprised by the Manchurian attack to the point of obliviously performing their regular activities to the moment the horsemen strike by the sword; even a wedding ceremony is completely surprised. Why sure! The chasm sequence is also weak because the warriors wouldnt be able to successfully jump across unless it was 20 wide or less, but it looks much wider. Then theres the lame tiger CGI. Despite these negatives, this is an eminent adventure/action flick.

Unless you speak Korean youll have to click on the English audio or subtitles on the DVD.

The film runs 128 minutes and was shot in South Korea.

4983189,4,B006C1S1DY,"I enjoyed this film, I always like it when the main character is humble but uses his/her surroundings to win the enemy. That's always fun to watch. I was also surprised when one of the enemy guys was set on fire alive, I'm used to Korean movies being more conservative. Not that I have a problem with it, I enjoy scenes like that :) Anyways great movie, there were some realistic scenes (like when the natives were being used as target practice for the enemy invaders), and the arrow action was great of course.

Pursuit adventures such as this can at times become ho hum; yet the effectiveness of the story in making you believe that not only seeing around corners is possible,seeing the baddies cop it in the vulnerable parts of the human anatomy is adventurous enough to accept the premise. All in all, Korean Cinema is well. Just one tip: Leave the subtitles to bring the story to you, as with most subtitled narratives, they sound a little strange with Western voices.

Without looking up this movie I went ahead and purchased this and by far..this was one of the best movies I have ever owned. Having bought it close to a year ago it never crossed my mind to write any review on it but after rewatching it here I am.

If you are a fan of anything Korean..buy it! If you love anything with a hint of Korean History..BUY IT!

Without adding too much of a spoiler this movie caught me by surprise with its ending. Most would say ""It's cliche."" however when a movie is just that good you tend to over look details like that. Cliche movies are my favorite because it's easier to understand the story and relate to it more, but its all about delivery that sets it apart. (any movie for that matter) Very sad ending to such a great movie. I actually cried.

If you are a fan of Korean Historical Dramas...a lot of them have a similiar ending if you catch my drift...

4983242,5,B006C1S1DY,"Reviews from a Guy

War of the Arrows delivered on every level of entertainment value. I love foreign cinema in the vein of Red Cliff and Kingdom of War parts I and II and this while different in its overall scope was just as good, if not better in some ways. This movie was more localized in the action sequences versus big battle epics such as in other war movies of this genre. The heroes were flawed, but over-comers in the end. The villains were bad, but got their come-up-ins in the appropriate manner. The fight scenes were many, but unlike many movies in this genre they were not over the top and were well grounded in reality with no hint of magic garbage like floating in the air stuff as scene in sub-par movies of this genre. The movie also did not contain the Far East fatalism that can be found in some movies in the genre such as Hero, which was very refreshing. It was like watching an epic struggle to survive against all odds, protect ones own, and to be able to live or die on ones own terms. That the entire movie was in subtitles didn't matter at all. To sum it all up I guess the best way of saying how engrossing this movie was is that my wife hates movies of this genre. Her reaction, ""Not another Chinese war movie!"" ""Its Korean, Honey"" ""Whatever."" Wife proceeds to study iphone distractions in order to avoid watching movie. Fifteen minutes go by and iphone is put down and not picked back up. :)) Great movie everyone!",1415923200,4,1445,4.351851851851852
4983243,5,B006C1S1DY,"I really enjoyed this movie. The story is good, parts of the villages being led to slavery by the Manchurian  make me imagine how Yazidi today must feel against ISIS in Iraq today.

But for example, one guy pauses before killing his attacker to say 'I'm taking you with me"", which allows another enemy to kill him first. DUDE!
There are alot of moments like that. That being said; the actual idea of the arrows and the hunting and pursuing of the man with the arrows is spectacular.

This is not the case in this movie which is the reason I got absorbed in the acting which is excellant. From begining to the end I was hooked in the story line having been built around the bow and arrow. This has to be one of the best period pieces I have seen to date from the Pacific Rim since they did not relay on martial arts. I seriously hope they dub other movies as well as this one.

4983283,5,B006C1S1DY,"This is one of the finest action/adventure films of this century, the highest-grossing film in Korean history. Rightly so, it gives you the gut-feeling pulse-running excitement of man hunting man for pride, country or womanhood in the early 17th Century Manchuria. Escape, capture, further escapes, thrills from beginning to end. It contains one of the greatest heroes of the bow since Robin Hood, only magnified by jaw-dropping special effects of slo-motion cinematography in pristine, rock-rimmed, cascading falls terrain. The acting is superb throughout in locales that are absolutely awe-inspiring every time man touches ground to hunt, kill or maim when the risks are high and the odds minimum. In a matter of minutes you forget modernity entirely and never want to return or leave your seat until the finish. And that time is even more surprising, though fated. This is no game, this was life before gunpowder and in the grips of this wonderful script it enlarges notions of heroism, freedom, survival skills, national pride and family as a Manchurian party attempts to assert its domination over a perceived inferior one. There is no finer film depicting group or personal hunting strategies in the wild whether hand-to-hand or man vs. man than this one. Forget Rambos. At the start there are two escaping traitors with exceptional bow skills who separate but make use of their wits and instincts to stay alive to reunite.

Most of the Korean action/period movies that I have seen seem to rely too much on special effects and there is so much sexism that it is difficult for me to bear:  I am so glad I kept an open mind and watched this movie because this is one of the best movies of all time!  This movie was a great movie about a person sticking to his morals and avenging a wrong and going after the people he cares about to help them, even though he is hard-headed and has some things to learn himself about letting the people he loves be the people they actually are and not just who he wants them to be.  He makes stupid mistakes in every day life, but when it comes down to it, his heart is in the right place, which is part of his growing up process.  When evil outsiders descend upon the village, but eventually he understands that although in everyday life it SEEMED like he was at odds with people, they actually have the same goals/values (maybe different ways of pursuing them that during peace time can seem so different it can seem incompatible).  Basically:  great suspense, tracking and bow/arrow and excellent bad guys, he astonishingly challenges them, then barely gets away with his life in a game of, not of cat versus mouse, but of army of tigers versus mouse.  His chance for redemption is the same one that allows others redemption.  One of my favorite all time movies.",1394236800,,1483,4.402930402930403

The Mongols which now control the kingdom Qui better know to us as China have sent raiders to sack cities and bring home slaves from northern cities of Korea or Chosun. Our Hero a young man who has given up on life because of the murder of his father years earlier because the King thought him a traitor has to use his abilities with a bow and arrow to save his younger sister who has been on her wedding day captured by the Mongols and is being taken back to China as a slave. The movie is full of action and as always beautiful landscape and good picture quality. The Korean Movies and k dramas are always well made and you get spoiled by how well they are made. The Movie endings are not always the same as American movies endings but are much, much better endings than the Chinese endings where everyone dies including the horse, dog and cat.

The only technical breakdown I could see, was the computer generated tiger. They could have Blue-screened a quick film clip of a real tiger attacking, followed by the results.
Now, this was a film centering on an archer, but it struck me that I did not see a single firearm used. This takes place in the 17th century. Every major kingdom in Asia had them. There had to be at least one musketeer among all the Manchurian and Mongol soldiers in the Qing army. Did anyone see any?",1380499200,2,620,4.535714285714286

4983329,4,B006C1S1DY,"First of all, for the reviews that are comparing this movie to Apocalypto just pay no mind.  Apocalypto is one of my favorite movies ever and the Kung Fu/ Asian genre is my favorite genre's but to logically compare the two are silly.  Production wise this film doesn't hold a candle to a Mel Gibson productions and the plots may have some similarities but so do many action movies.  How many movies can we list where a hero avenges the deaths of his own people/ family?

That being said, if you love this genre as I do then you know exactly what to expect and this movie will exceed expectations.  It really is cool to see a badass with a bow.  The movie has a lot of action and I would say after the first 30 mins or so the action is pretty non stop.

The only reason I took one star away is one of the scenes toward the end is extremely corny in my opinion.  There is a clearly computer animated tiger where the movements and interaction with the actors looks terrible.  I could have done without this scene.  Or even kept the idea but just not actually shown the tiger but rather the aftermath.

I am usually not so picky especially given the history of kung fus and their corny scenes but I was so into the movie and that scene kinda made me loose focus for a second.

Anyway it really is a cool movie and definitely worth a view.",1360540800,5,1334,4.208661417322834

Once the movie starts it like a roller coaster ride, you know that turn and dip is coming but thats all, same here.  The acting was excellent with some minor issues from the female star at times otherwise a very strong cast.  The dubbing is very good in compasion with the subtitles. Will say that my family when the movie started looked like they were all just bored and joked, half way, no noise, at the climax there were oooo's and aaaa's.

Here are the things about the movie I enjoyed:

- A decent story of a brother and his sister, love and loss, and the struggles of a nation at war.
- Great action scenes. The effects were good, and action wasn't just randomly thrown in as filler.
- Whether you like a good story or action movies, this movie caters to both. The violence isn't unnecessary, and there's not excessive gore.

The English dubbing isn't the worst (if that's your thing), but I definitely prefer the Korean audio with English subtitles. Things flow better that way, but if you don't like subtitles, it's not horrible.

I have seen every Robinhood film ever made I think and lots of Chinese and Japanese films with and involving wars and feats of archery, all were good and enjoyable. But this Korean story and film surpasses any I have ever seen in story, action, shooting and creativity. Some of these shots are unbelievable, not as in bull sh*t but as in WoW. Just like the Olympics there are scenes where the shot is slowed down to where you see the arrow snake back and forth toward it's intended target.

4983343,4,B006C1S1DY,"A big box-office hit in South Korea in 2011, a period action movie ""War of the Arrows"" chronicles the desperate attempts of a lonely archer Choi Nam-yi (Park Hae-il), whose young sister Choi Ja-in (Moon Chae-won) is kidnapped by the invading armies of the Manchu Qing Empire. Nam-yi has to catch up with the Qing army going north with captive villagers before it is too late.

Not much historical knowledge is needed to enjoy the film's thrilling combat scenes. Set in the early 17th century, the drama starts with an episode about young Nam-yi and Ja-in trying to escape from the city of Hanyang (today's Seoul) with their death-sentenced father, who gives his son a family heirloom bow. Not much action takes place in the film's first third, except the wedding of Ja-in and Kim Seo-goon (Kim Mu-yeol), where the film's story gets interesting.

Some of the film's earlier action scenes are edited choppily, with the camera moving and jolting too much, but wait a while. The action sequences get better as the Qing army's commander Jyuushinta (Ryoo Seung-ryong) enters the story, tracking down our deadly archer with his band of fearsome warriors. The film's best part is their life-or-death chase in the mountains that may remind you of the first John Rambo movie.

The storyline looks like a cross between ""The Last of the Mohicans"" and Mel Gibson's ""Apocalypto,"" and the film's two hour running time is a bit too long, spending too much time on the introductory part, but ""War of the Arrows"" delivers its goods, a nice, trilling action movie.",1347667200,5,1545,4.866920152091255

4983351,3,B006C1S1DY,"i took a look at one page of reviews for this movie and was very surprised that nobody noticed the similarities between this movie and mel gibson's apocalypto.

the similarities are :

1. enemy captures people and takes them elsewhere as slaves
2. (hero rescues some and flees and) a band of the enemy chases him
3. in the chase, he leads them into a wild animal (puma in apocalypto and tiger here) which savages the chasers
4. he uses other techniques to whittle down the number of his pursuers

beyond these similarities there are some dynamics which are unique to this movie. but there is little doubt that apocalypto inspired this movie. but this movie cannot really compare with the visceral experiece that mel gibson's production was.

4983356,5,B006C1S1DY,"Originally called Choi-jong-byeong-gi Hwal (`Arrow the Ultimate weapon') we start this film by seeing a young Nam-Yi seeing his home being attacked as his father has been branded a traitor, as such a claim means that the whole family must die, he orders Nam-Yi to take flight with his young sister Ja-In being chased by some slavering dogs and slavering lackeys to the King. The plot then jumps on thirteen years to 1636. Nam-Yi is now being played by Hae-Il Park - (`Memories of Murder' and `The Host'). His sister has fallen in love with their adopted new family's son and they want to marry, and he is none too pleased as the match is unfitting, so he gets drunk and starts a bar brawl.

The wedding goes ahead any way, but just as Ja-In is about to tie the knot a strange rumbling is heard. This heralds the second Manchurian (Qing Dynasty of China)invasion of Korea and they are there for plunder, pillage, and slaves, so not at all welcome wedding guests. Nam-Yi has been trying to emulate his father's skills as a bow man and when he encounters the enemy he lets fly. The Chinese are both impressed and threatened by him and set out to get him at all costs. He meanwhile is following the slave caravan to attempt a rescue. What follows is a full on action film with excellent camera work and a high degree of authenticity in both the sets and the quite stunning period costume and detail.

Also there is an attempt to paint both sides with some honour, so the Chinese are portrayed as a nasty bunch but with some saving graces, though not many. This is loosely based on history but with a lot of poetic licence, but this is a film and not a history lesson. There is some dodgy CGI but to say where would be a plot spoiler and this has been slightly cut to remove perceived animal cruelty of a horse.

Director Han-Min Kim has made a film that compliments the ever growing catalogue of excellent films that have come from South Korea. If you have a liking of historical, costume, war based drama then you will probably want to see this, it is just over two hours long, but virtually all of that is used wisely, no nasty bed room antics but plenty of good old fashioned action. As mentioned there are some flaws but not enough to lose a star hence the rating, in Korean and Chinese with English sub titles- recommended.",1340064000,3,2324,4.437939110070258
4983357,5,B006C1S1DY,Absolutely amazing movie. Should have been released in cinemas around the world. The second Korean movie after Musa the Warrior that delivers the goods. Non-stop action.

Their level is quite high, all-in-all. This was an overdone, non-stop chase with not much plot

Certainly, after watching War of Arrows; I've a new found respect for Korean cinema. This movie cannot disapoint you. Its gripping from start to end. The performances are top-notch; not to forget the sound, action and plot, which will keep you hooked, from start to end. The chase scenes in the last 30 minutes are amazing as well. Who knew that a movie; based on the theme of arrows and invasion would be so interesting. I would highly recommend this movie; to fans of this genere and cinema.

4983363,2,B006C1S1DY,This movie is basically the Korean version of Mel Gibson's movie Apocalypto. I loved Apocalypto and it's one of my favorite movies. I wasn't so much amused watching this copy and paste version of it that was adapted to Korean culture. Sure the writers mixed the plot around and tried to make certain scenes from the movie seem different but it's the same story only remixed. Even right down to the ending where in Apocalypto you saw the invasion of Christianity and in War of the Arrows you see a European guard on a Korean border. Was this a good movie? It was okay. I can't exactly give 5 stars to someone elses ideas that they stole. If anyone says this movie is nothing like Apocalypto or is original they are lying through their teeth. Please watch Apocalypto then this copy of that movie and you'll understand. This movie basically removes the Mayan culture and replaces it with Korean culture. I'm surprised they didn't get sued for this film.,1336176000,,950,4.627218934911243
4983364,5,B006C1S1DY,"This was probably one of the best foreign films I've ever seen - and I watch a lot of them.

The story centers on a very talented--and lethal--archer who goes against the Qing Dynasty to save his younger sister from Mongolian invaders. Along the way he allies with his previous foe, the man who strives to marry his sister, and together they battle it out to save her and hopefully make it out alive. If not, their goal is to take down as many as they can before they go.

The setting of this movie is amazing. The shooting locations and placement of cameras allow for shots that are breathtaking and entertaining on their own, even without the fast-paced plot and great acting. The use of bows and arrows almost entirely throughout the many well-choreographed fight scenes makes the fighting much more dramatic and unique compared to other war and battle type movies, giving it an edge over others currently on the market.

There is rarely a dull moment, and the fast pace and constant action and character interaction makes this a must see for those wanting an exciting movie night.",1335830400,2,1084,4.664921465968586

I wouldn't compare it to The Hunger Games as some reviewers have - they're two completely different types of movies. War of the Arrows stands on it's own with great acting, action and drama.",1335571200,2,271,4.666666666666667
4983367,5,B006C1S1DY,"Other reviewers covered the story lines so I'd like to share my views.

Action packed Korean cinema at its best like Man from Nowhere.  Realistic and gripping.  Superb acting without over the top special effect martial arts scenes.  Chinese action movies border of comical ridiculousness with men flying, special effect filled martial arts and sword scenes.  Chinese action drama crudely inserts pretty women and some kind of joke romance.  Guess that's what it takes to draw in the women viewers yet so obviously FAKE after thoughts not to mention rounds of humanly impossible martial action scenes.

Villains played by the Manchu fighters were real and added to the drama.  The lead villain was realistic with superb acting.

Negatives?  Hardly but it was slow in the beginning.  Tiger scene was poor special effect and could have taken out.

Now some historical perspectives:

The invaders are Manchurians who share similar languages and cultures going back thousands of years as Koreans and Mongolians, and for that matter areas between Korea and Mongolia.  Mongolians migrated to what is now Korea thru Manchuria or North East ""Dong Bei"" China which was in the hands on Manchu/Jurchen tribes most of the time (historically not part of China and thus Chinese built the Great Wall just north of Beijing to fend off the northern barbarians).  Parts of North East China were ruled by Koreans along with Jurchen (Manchus) most of the time until Manchus invaded China.  You can wiki Manchuria for more about history and people.

The Manchus overran the Han Chinese and established Qing dynasty about same time in early 1600's(last dynasty before it fell part in early 1900's).  Manchus got so absorbed by Han Chinese culture that the Manchurian culture is long gone and language is only spoken by few thousand people in China today.  Only few famous Chinese admit to their proud Manchu heritage.

That is why the language spoken was distinctively Manchu and does not sound like Mandarin Chinese and more like Korean.",1335571200,3,2015,5.048484848484849
4983368,5,B006C1S1DY,"I always hesitate to give a film a five star rating because there are so few perfect films out there. But this was so well realized and executed I must give it it's due. Given the type of film it is, I don't know that it could have been done better.

Here's the scoop. Sometime in the mid centuries, China has invaded Korea. A Korean fiefdom is besieged and a brother and sister manage to escape as their king father is put to the sword. They hide out at a friend's. Years later, as they've grown up, sis is going to marry their benefactor's son, but on the wedding day they are raided once again and sis is captured along with most everyone else in the town. Now it's up to brother to save the day.

This is one exciting movie and it's paced really well. There are action scenes which build throughout that are punctuated with quieter scenes that help relieve the tension. What is really happening here is that the chief weapon used by most everyone is the bow and arrow. Other than Legolas in ""Lord of the Rings"" I can't say I've ever seen this before, and it makes for some thrilling confrontations. The brother is a particularly good (and quick) shot so he has a leg up on the bad guys. When the final chase and fighting ensue it's a marvel to see him do his thing. This also has a great climax and ending. Very ""Hollywood"" at a certain level but it got me going.

This is a really professional outing. Every aspect of production is top shelf. The editing, particularly, struck me. It really got my pulse pounding. If you like truly exciting, breath-stealing action films, this is the real deal.",1335398400,3,1599,4.377104377104377

4983370,5,B006C1S1DY,"Having seen news reports that interest in archery has dramatically increased since the release of ""The Hunger Games,"" I would suggest that ""War Of The Arrows,"" would start an archery epidemic.  Comparing the two films is like arguing that ""Dumb and Dumber"" is better than ""The Godfather.""  One is simple (not to suggest stupidity) and the other is complex (without being difficult to understand).

If archery is your thing, ""The War Of The Arrows"" will completely satisfy that hunger.  If you want nothing more than a great entertainment, you will not regret the time invested.",1334620800,17,577,5.042105263157895

4983373,5,B006C1S1DY,"I could go into detail about this choice bit of South Korean cinema. I could mention that WAR OF THE ARROWS, set in the 17th century, prefaces the meat of the story with the King's loyal servant and legendary archer being executed on trumped-up charges, and that the archer's young son and daughter subsequently flee and gain sanctuary with their father's old comrade. Thirteen years would elapse, and, in the home of their father's friend, the son and daughter, Nam-yi and Ja-in, grow into young adults.

Except that, somewhere in the intervening years, Nam-yi (Hae-il Park) had lost his way. A bowman of some skill, Nam-yi nurses a healthy bump of self-preservation. But as the son of a widely labeled traitor, he lives a wasted life, and disillusionment has set in. WAR OF THE ARROWS (Original title: ""Choi-jong-byeong-gi Hwal"") goes on to chronicle Nam-yi's fight for redemption. But the thing you need to know most is this: WAR OF THE ARROWS lays down some pretty awesome archery-fu.

China's ambitious Qing dynasty and its invasion of Korea's Joseon state fuel Nam-yi's quest for atonement. The brutal attack coincides with the wedding of Nam-yi's sister Ja-in. When Qing troops abduct Ja-in (as well as 500,000 other Korean hostages), Nam-yi, tardy to the scene, embarks on a far-fetched rescue mission, armed only with his father's old bow and a supply of red-fletched arrows.

As the Qing forces and their hostages make their way to Manchuria, and as we track Nam-yi's relentless one-man guerrilla warfare, we're treated to several moments of fiendish marksmanship as the traitor's son takes out one enemy soldier after another. If you dig underdog stories, then you can't help but get jazzed when Nam-yi's exhibition of unfailing aim gradually has a demoralizing effect on the Qing troops. Even the Qing's elite cadre of bowmen begins to marvel at this determined sniper dogging their heels. Robin Hood, I think, would approve of Nam-yi who, in the eyes of his enemies, gradually ascend to near mythical status.

WAR OF THE ARROWS is an epic historical action film. It keeps you on edge with its well-staged scenes of dazzling bowmanship and the suspenseful cat-and-mouse games enacted between Nam-yi and the Qing's band of select archers. The narrative roots you emotionally, thanks in large part to Hae-il Park's transformative performance, going from disillusioned no-good-nik to selfless hero. Veteran actor Ryu Seung-ryong brings a commanding presence as the warlord heading up the elite Qing archers (I grudgingly liked the guy). Moon Chae-Won has soaked in her props for injecting refreshing backbone and feistiness into Ja-in, a character who doesn't take her abduction lying down. In fact, action-wise, her character would be pivotal in the film's climactic sequence. With its slew of dynamic moments, I think WAR OF THE ARROWS one-ups Russell Crowe's recent take on Robin Hood. I think that director Kim Han-min has managed to breathe fresh life into the bow and arrow picture. And Nam-yi is mesmerizing, both as a conflicted character and a dead-eye marksman who doesn't necessarily have to shoot straight to hit his target. Nock that shaft, Nam-yi, and let it loose crooked if you wish. The effect's the same.",1334361600,18,3231,5.090566037735849

Nam-yi (Park Hae-il, Scent of Love and Memories of Murder) escapes with his sister Ja-in (Moon Chae-won, Painter of the Wind, Brilliant Legacy and My Fair Lady). Now fast forward thirteen years and Ja-in is now getting married. However, as the wedding is taking place, the Manchurian army invades and kills / captures the entire town. War of the Arrows is about a brother's attempt to rescue his only remaining family member who's just been kidnapped.

This movie has some very nice acting and great costumes. The bows and arrows are authentic looking, are nicely detailed and used throughout the movie. They also have some very good scenery as there are lots of forest scenes and mountains. The movie also has a somewhat bad CGI of a tiger attack. I watched this movie in Korean with English subs, like 95% of all my foreign films. I did try out the English dub for about five minutes but couldn't take it so I switched back to Korean and never looked back. This is basically a bare bones blu ray as the only extras you'll be getting is a four minute making featurette with a very fast cast interview of the four main characters and a bunch of trailers for the movie.  This is one of the best movies I've seen within the past year as I've been very disappointed lately with some of Hollywood's offerings.

As his home is invaded, he has his children flee to the home of his best friend, Kim Min-soon (Lee Kyeong-Yeong). Before they can escape, his children witness their father's death. Thirteen years later, the archer's children have both inherited their father's archery skills. Nam-Yi (Park Hae-il) spends most of his days brooding, keeping to himself, and drinking his life away. Ja-in (Moon Chae-won) has bigger things in mind and is prepared to marry the son of Kim Min-soon Seo-goon (Kim Mu-Yeol) even if it's without her older brother's blessing. On their wedding day, Manchurian soldiers attack their village, kidnap Ja-in, and enslave everyone that isn't killed in the initial attack. Nam-Yi will stop at nothing to gain revenge and rescue his sister with his trusted bow even if it means going up against the Qing army and its remorseless commander Jyuu Shin-Ta (Ryu Seung-Ryong).

If the trailer doesn't sell you on War of the Arrows, then nothing will. The brief glimpses you get of the chase through the forest and arrows practically falling into your lap as they wisp by you should make that inner action child inside most of us squeal with delight. Have you ever been on the Indiana Jones ride at Disneyland? There's a part where arrows are supposedly being shot at you and you feel gusts of air blowing from every direction giving you the feeling that you're narrowly dodging serious injury or death. I would love to see War of the Arrows in a theater with that effect when the action gets heavy. It would be one of the greatest movie theater experiences ever.

To state the obvious, there's an extreme importance lying on bows and arrows in this foreign action film. It does take place in the mid-1600s, so maybe firearms had yet to make it to Korea. It's fascinating to see a war movie like this with an absence of any sort of guns though, especially with such excellent results. The arrows are not only important as a weapon, but the types of arrows used by each individual archer usually helps identify the person shooting them. The half-pound arrow is a great example, but even Nam-Yi's red arrows make it easier for his enemy to track him.

The fast-paced action does get really heavy though and that should be the selling point. Get excited whenever somebody runs into a forest. Those sequences along with the ones in the field are the best in the film. Arrows flying in every direction, everyone hiding behind trees for cover, and blood spraying into the air as some unfortunate soul wasn't aware of Nam-Yi's awesome arrow shooting technique. It's also pretty much become the standard of all foreign films looking superb on Blu-ray. War of the Arrows is littered with luscious shades of green, red, and yellow. The film is just completely enriched with both color and fantastic action.

Complaints for the film are few and far between. The camera work is a bit too shaky at times, especially in the first half of the film. It seems like the camera man is running with the actors, which isn't necessarily a bad thing but will leave you craving a steadier shot. We probably could have gone without the barf scene, as well. The completely computer generated tiger also looks kind of funky, but isn't around long enough to be much of an issue.

War of the Arrows is beautiful to look at, has a solid story, features a strong cast, and its action is swift and intense. While the camera work is a bit wobbly at times during the action sequences, it eventually balances out. With its vibrant colors, breathtaking scenery, and accelerated chases that usually end in bloodshed, War of the Arrows is not to be missed by anyone who's a fan of action or foreign films.

Special features and extras are kept to a bare minimum. There's a four minute behind the scenes feature. The biggest piece of information you take away from it is how fast Park Hae-il was able to learn how to ride horses and use a bow and arrow. The three minute ""Highlights"" feature is a little odd. It introduces the characters, but also gives away several key story moments. Then there's the original trailer and the U.S. trailer. That's all the bonus materials War of the Arrows has.

War of the Arrows is currently available as a one-disc DVD and a two-disc DVD/Blu-ray combo pack. The film is rated R for bloody violence, presented in a 16:9 widescreen aspect ratio in both stereo and 5.1 HD Surround Sound, and available in Korean with English subtitles or an English dub track. War of the Arrows is approximately 123 minutes long and is now available in most retail outlets and online stores.",1330560000,8,4645,4.699017199017199
