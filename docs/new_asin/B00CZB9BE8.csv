5761843,4,B00CZB9BE8,"At the conclusion of the War in the Pacific (""V J Day,"" for those of us old enough to remember), the Allied forces had a dilemma: Should the Emperor of Japan (the Emperor of the Chrysanthemum Throne) be tried (and hung) for war crimes? Few of us gave it a moment's consideration at the time, but here is a thought-provoking drama that examines the issue.

It stars:
  * Tommy Lee Jones (""Lincoln"") as General Douglas MacArthur, tasked with reconstructing Japan, writing a constitution and restoring the economy. (Plus MacArthur really wants to run for President of the United States.) Is Jones getting all the good parts lately, or does he just make his parts seem that good?
  * Matthew Fox (""Alex Cross"") as General Bonner Fellers, the guy who understands that if Emperor Hirohito is hung, an insurrection will be inevitable and the war will NOT be over. Fox does great suppressed rage. Watch for it!
  * Eriko Hatsune (""Norwegian Wood"") as Aya, the sweetheart Fellers met in college where she was an exchange student, but now long missing in the tumult of war.

The political issues are clearly stated, the situation is engrossing, the PG-13 dialogue is realistic, and a key statement in Japanese, by a Japanese official, has very legible captions in English. I'm sure the DVD from Amazon will have everything with captions. Whew!",1370995200,85,1333,4.841409691629956
5761844,4,B00CZB9BE8,"""Emperor"" (2013 release; 98 min.) brings the true story of how General/Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces MacArthur (played here by Tommy Lee Jones) was sent to Japan following Japan's surrender to end WWII, to assess which top ranking officials from Japan, including possibly Emperor Hirohito, should be brought to justice and stand trial. MacArthur enlistens the help of General Fellers (played by Matthew Fox) for the actual investigations, focusing on the Emperor, the Prime Minister and a few other top Ministers. The problem is that Washington demands a conclusion in only 10 days. The movie's script (based on the book 'His Majesty's Salvation' by Shiro Okamoto) intertwines the political and military aspects with a romantic involvement by Fellers with a Japanese woman whom he gets to know in the 1930s in the US, but who eventually returns to Japan without telling Fellers. Fellers is determined to find her now that he is back in Japan. Will Fellers find his former flame? Will Fellers and MacArthur conclude that the Emperor of Japan must stand trial? To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several thoughts: director Peter Webber (best known for directing ""Girl With a Pearl Earring"") does a nice job in bringing the necessary historical background and further perspective, so as to appreciate the task at hand for Fellers and MacArthur. Even though Tokyo was not hit by the atomic bomb, it nevertheless was severely shelled and bombed, and we get a glimpse of what that must've felt like. Tommy Lee Jones does the most with the choice role of MacArthur, including adding some much needed occasional humor. The meeting between MacArthur and the Emperor towards the movie's end is by far THE highlight of the movie. Kudo also to Alex Heffes for scoring a beautiful soundtrack for this movie. Last but not least, at the very end of the movie, we get to see several still pictures of the actual events, which really add to the poignancy of the movie.

The screening I saw this at in my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati a few months ago was (to my surprise) very well attended and tilting heavily towards the seniors, so this movie might have some legs on DVD (it played quite some weeks in the theatre), not unlike that other recent historical movie ""Hyde Park on Hudson"". Bottom line: if you like historical drama, you will be well served by ""Emperor"".",1369958400,217,2451,4.861244019138756

5761847,2,B00CZB9BE8,"I started out liking the movie but, as I watched more, I disliked it more.  I have to be honest: 1) I'm a student of the Pacific War and have been for nearly all of my life. 2) I realize I was watching ""entertainment"" and NOT a ""documentary"".  That being said:

1) Tommy Lee Jones did a good job of masking his southern accent.  However, his continual ""potty mouth"" before subordinates was totally out of the real MacArthur's character.

2) The movie gave the idea that U.S. military figures had to ""negotiate"" with the Japanese when they entered Japan after WWII.  There was NO negotiation!  Japan knew they had lost the war.  Typical in the movie was where Matthew Fox (Fellers) tries to enter the Imperial Palace and is nearly prevented by so-call Japanese Guards with a tank in the background.  Yeah, right!  As I recall, Hirohito did not have to be coerced into visiting MacArthur - he offered to do so.

3) Perhaps the most insulting to me was the ""moral equivalence"" showed throughout the picture.  One Japanese official said that BOTH sides were guilty because the US had bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Let me get this straight -- Japan attacked China, killed 100,000-200,000 people at Nanking, caused the direct or indirect death of millions of Chinese, bombed Pearl Harbor, raped and executed in Hong Kong, the Bataan Death March, medical experiments on POWs and Chinese, caused the death of 100,000 Filipinos in Manila, numerous deaths in POW camps under their control.  And we bombed two cities; yep, sounds the same to me!!  That is like saying the Germans are excused from all their concentration camp horrors because we bombed Dresden.  Yeah, right!

4) One of the Japanese figures said (with perhaps more justification) that Japan was just trying to emulate Britain and the U.S. by seizing territory.  This is partially true, but the Japanese were hardly innocent before 1941 - Taiwan in 1895, Korea in 1905, Okinawa, Tsingtao in 1914 and numerous Pacific Islands as a result of World War I.

5) Of course the love story that Hollywood is so enamored of.  Totally imaginary

In summation, this movie, even for ""entertainment"", had numerous flaws.  Unfortunately, with the lack of historical sophisitaction held by so many younger people today, people will leave this movie thinking they were seeing the truth, instead of a carefully crafted lie.",1500422400,4,2362,4.881909547738694

5761852,2,B00CZB9BE8,"This time period is such an interesting one -- and Tommy Lee Jones (featured prominently on the movie poster) is a great actor. I really thought I would love this movie but it was disappointing. (Not worth renting or buying!) Tommy Lee Jones is barely in the film, for one thing. However, the more important thing is that the film strays far from the facts of the time period.

5761853,4,B00CZB9BE8,"This is a fine military-political drama about the early occupation of Japan by victorious United States forces.  General MacArthur, who was Supreme Allied Commander, had a very difficult dilemma before him, as the public and the US government clamored for Japan's war criminals to face justice.  Was the Emperor to be tried?  Was he to be allowed to continue to reign as Emperor of Japan?  Was the Emperor himself a war criminal? None of these things were clear.  This film deals with the way MacArthur and his advisors dealt with these thorny issues.

This is a very watchable film.  Tommy Lee Jones does a good job as General MacArthur.  Matthew Fox is outstanding as General Fellers, the Brigadier General who MacArthur tasks to make a recommendation as to the decision regarding the Emperor.  The under-story of General Fellers' earlier romance with a Japanese girl is nicely done and I suppose Hollywood could not bring itself to make any film without some story of this type.

5761868,5,B00CZB9BE8,"There are many movies about war but this one is not about actual war but conseqience of war dealing with Japan whether Emperor Hirohito should be hanged as a war criminal. But it was more then that.
The general Fellers who was acted by Matthew Fox went to Japan for two reasons one is of course to meet Emperor and talk with him and also research if he is responsible for the war and decide if to hang him or not. But the other reason is to find out the girl named Aya the girl he met at the exchange school back then the one he loved.

It was quite sentimental way to show that Japan is also the victim to the war by showing the girl Aya dead the one who is loved by western general.

You see Japan is strong brutal for weak countries and weak good to strong countries at all times.
But looking back who does not?
They raped our Women, they experiment our people during war, thet slaughtered our last king and queen and never said sorry not like German's. Who cares anyway right? But may i ask  why the hell did you rape our queen before burn her? Is it a samuri spirit?

In this movie as you already know American treat Japan with the most graceful way.
Showing the Emperor Hirohito is more like showing god which can be represent how they feel about Japan even if they are the enemy.

As we see from other American movies like <YAKUZA> by Sydney Pollack, <Black Rain><Blade Runner> Ridley Scott, <The Last Samurai> by Edward Zwick you can see how they look at Japan. It was always graceful and powerful being for them.
In this movie even if they were the enemy who attacked them, they are the one who is powerful enough to attack them and they admit them as their team spirit. Who can actually put their gun at them. A small country but has guts to do something big. Something like that.

They bow to the emperor as if he is their god. They treat as if he is thir king.
They speak Japanese as if they try to treat them well.
They will never do that to Korea or any other countries like maybe Vietnam or something. It is Japan that is why.

I am no against how America look and treat Japan and I am just think that our coutry should be more strong enough not to be conqured by them again thats all.

This movie because of how they treat and show the grace toward Japan makes it so artistic and you will love it. Artistically it is superior.

Also I have to mention that this movie is based on the book written by a Japanses guy.

WHERE TO FIND: Bluray is just 9$. Watch it. It's good quality.

You'll have to get by accepting Tommy Lee Jones playing General Douglas MacArthur but once you get past the country aspects of his portrayal he plays SCAP (Supreme Commander Allied Powers) to reflect the man's imperiousness and impatience with Washington's interference. General Bonner Fellers investigated emperor Hirohito's responsibility for starting the war just as portrayed in the movie with the sole exception of the make believe Hollywood prewar romance with a Japanese woman.

This film serves not useful purpose other than to perpetuate myths and half-truths about Japan's role in ASIA from 1930s onward.  I can see it from Mac Arthur's point of view Japan would have become ungovernable had Hirohito been put to death but that does not excuse the executions of his officials.

5761921,3,B00CZB9BE8,"Entertaining, well-acted, well-directed film about an important, but little known historical event.  The film is not nearly as interesting as the true story on which it is based, the story of a strange relationship between an American army officer and a Japanese woman whom he had met at Earlham College.  Hollywood turned in into a love story and threw in some moral equivalency notions to suggest that Japanese imperialism was no different from American imperialism and that Japanese atrocities were no different from America's dropping the atomic bomb.  The implication is that it was militarism on both sides that kept them apart.  Right.  The historical principals were themselves much more ambiguous.",1446076800,2,706,5.324324324324325

5761951,4,B00CZB9BE8,"Most historical fiction is imperfect, and this movie is no exception. I am inclined to agree with the brief summary on Wikipedia of its critical reception: a good movie that was marred by a silly love story subplot that did not in any way advance the main thesis. As to its historical accuracy, I am neither a historian nor an expert of the period, but I believe it is safe to say that not every fact of the story should be believed literally. As with all historical fiction, it should serve to make you reassess prior beliefs after some research using more credible sources. Emperor does not pretend to placate Emperor Hirohito's role in the war in China nor in his role in consenting to the attack on Pearl Harbor. On the contrary, it's portrayal of Emperor Hirohito (mostly indirectly) shows him to be an imperfect human in deeply challenging and imperfect circumstances, pressured by militarists and forced to obey codes of honor that are not readily understood by foreigners. While one may disagree with the lectures on the guilt of the European and American colonialists (and I strongly disagreed with basic facts of the lecture), nobody can doubt that all the major parties of the war in the Pacific, including the Americans, British, Chinese, and Japanese, had very dirty hands before, during, and after the war.",1442707200,,1320,4.819383259911894

5761954,4,B00CZB9BE8,"I was torn between 3 or 4 stars. A good movie, well worth seeing. Superb historical drama, with a quick pace, which I appreciate (most 'historical' movies seem to drag in my humble opinion). Matthew Fox as the protagonist was well chosen, and Tommy Lee Jones did a passable job as General MacArthur.
 It was funny-- seeing the synopsis for the flick I got the impression that this was about MacArthur in his role as the new Shogun of Japan. I was pleasantly surprised that this was a movie about the very early days of the American occupation of Japan, with the emphasis on the transfer of power from the old guard to the new. I liked it.
 What I believed detracted from the story was the subplot of the pre-war romance between Fox's character and a Japanese woman. While necessary to explain how Fox (Brigadier General Fellers) ended up in the position he was in, I thought it was overdone and kind of sappy. Again, only MY opinion.
 Of historical note-- I'm sure because of time constraints, General Fellers' background story did not include that he had been with MacArthur as an aide in the Philippines before the war, and that Eisenhower did not like him so after an event where Fellers had been sending very accurate and detailed reports about British Army units in North Africa to superiors in Washington, the Germans had broken the encryption and read every single report sent, Eisenhower was only too happy to send Fellers elsewhere.",1442361600,4,1441,4.687747035573122

5762020,5,B00CZB9BE8,"I am not much of an historian of the era but I found this movie very rewarding.  It reminds us that despite the bitterest of conflicts, terrible losses from war and its after effects, having some understanding of your ""enemy"" helps to return your relationship to one between human beings.  You can then begin to comprehend the cultural underpinnings of certain actions, and this can change the outcome of future relationships.  We have seen this over and over between countries over time, and even now the principles hold.  I thought these subjects were done with sensitivity but without over sentimentality.  The power of a love attachement to overcome stereotypes will always be a catalyst for change.  But overall, I just found the story and portrayal moving and a positive experience.",1437523200,,788,5.023076923076923

5762071,4,B00CZB9BE8,"I am a history buff and therefore I found this movie (it is a true story but not all about MacArthur---its more about a member of his staff) to be full of great details. The movie opens with the Enola Gay taking off to drop the first Atom Bomb on Japan. Next it moves to the palace revolt which was driven by those in the Japanese government who still wanted to continue the war even with the prospect that the United States would continue dropping Atomic bombs. That thought brought the Emperor who had the last say to call for the surrender. Tommy Lee Jones plays Gen MacArthur very well as you would expect. The other main character is Gen Bonner Fellers (played by Matthew Fox) who was a career US Army officer who had a love affair in Japan before World War II with a beautiful Japanese lady. Besides tracking down the Japanese responsible for the attack on Pearl Harbor and war criminals for prosecution, Fellers privately looks for the girl he loved as a sidebar to the history track. I don't know if that was factual but it adds a bit of romance to the history narrative. As to the destruction of Japan, the movie has some very good CG imposed in which miles and miles of bombed rubble of Tokyo is shown as the backdrop in many scenes. My view is that adds a bit much sympathy to the film for the Japanese people who not only attacked Pearl Harbor killing several thousand US military and Hawaiian civilians, the Japanese were most brutal to every people that they attacked. For example they killed millions of Chinese -- in Nanking alone there were 350,000 people killed by the Japanese army. The movie does not leave the impression that one should feel sorry for the Japanese but does not cover in detail the war crimes which they committed.",1434153600,,1751,4.492163009404389

5762122,3,B00CZB9BE8,"Tommy Lee Jones is fun, and the movie is worth watching.
The problem of what to do with the emperor has to be explained through dialog, and great gnashing of teeth, and an attempted comparison of Japanese imperialism with that of Britain and the US. It did leave you with the uncertainty over the role of the Emperor Hirohito in waging war. Was he really in charge, or was he a virtual captive of the ""militarists""?
At the end they have an inaccurate graphic that says General Eisenhower demoted General Fellers afterward. This was not the case.  During the Civil War and WWI and WWII US officers were promoted quickly up to temporarily higher ranks as the military expanded, and then they reverted back to their regular, lower rank after the war as the military was reduced in size. And so General Fellers went back to a regular rank of colonel.  As, for example, General Custer was promoted up to major general during the Civil War, and was reduced back to captain after the war, and eventually died 11 years later at the rank of lieutenant colonel.",1431648000,2,1051,4.614973262032086

While I had heard about the uproar over the Emperor's recorded message to his people, this puts things in a much clearer context. It is interesting that General MacArthur is featured on the poster, I imagined that this might be about his well documented megalomania and how he wanted to be Emperor of Japan; in reality, the movie is about a much more fascinating aspect of the search for war criminals after the treaty was signed, set against a romantic tale of separated lovers. I usually take a pass on romances, but this one combined that story line with a first class detective story. There are a lot of details that the cinematographers and the director got exactly right in their portrayal of these events, with the result being a very, very entertaining movie. The fact that Tommy Lee Jones is in a starring role doesn't hurt, either",1429574400,,908,4.68125

5762192,2,B00CZB9BE8,"EMPEROR tells an often forgotten and overlooked piece of World War II history - the fates of Emperor Hirohito and Japanese government officials at the end of the war. EMPEROR starts with the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The cities are destroyed by atomic bombs Japan agrees to an unconditional surrender. The country is soon  under America occupation. The country is devastated and the Japanese people are starving and broken in spirit. The future of Japan is now in the hands of the Americans.

It becomes the duty of  General Douglas MacArthur (Tommy Lee Jones) to determine if Emperor Hirohito, a god-like figure to most Japanese, was a willing participant in the planning of the war. MacArthur assigns the task to General Bonner Fellers (Matthew Fox) and gives him 10 days to determine if the Emperor should be tried as a war criminal. Fellers is especially fond of Japan and its culture and is desperate to determine the fate of a Japanese woman he loves. He is assignment tears him apart on a personal level. Fellers is a man in conflict as he tries to find proof that Hirohito was NOT a war  criminal. It's clear his agenda is to save Hirohito, thereby saving Japan from an uncertain future.
EMPEROR is a disappointment for a history buff. It could better delve into the minds of Japanese officials and their reasons for starting a war that ruined Japan. A chance to tell a historical story is lost and we have a mediocre film that can't seem to follow the line of either fiction or fact..",1428278400,,1502,4.678030303030303

I heard family discussions at the dinner table about it all, particularly from my father, who had served as a Major in WWII.  The issues around the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki had over-shadowed the ongoing subject of the occupation of Japan, and family members did not all agree on
the handling by Truman and our government.  For me, it put a human touch on something that had placed it all in the realm of unreality for my childish mind, then later on, I can see, in my politics.  I did some reading and found that Fellers (Matthew Fox) was a Quaker, which was very interesting to me and made his pain even more understandable.  I suffered along with him--thanks to a great script and can't say enough about his acting.  I thought this film was riveting, the acting was superb, and Tommy Lee Jones was amazingly like the MacArthur we've all read about and have seen in film/in newsreels.

5762267,5,B00CZB9BE8,"Excellent film. Fox and Jones do a commendable job of acting complex characters who were responsible for the rebuilding of Japan.

While the romance of Fellers (Fox) in the story was likely not factual since he had a wife and daughter back in the US, it propelled the film to a personal level and took the edge off the harshness of the scenes in Japan after the war. Fellers was the real hero in this situation and Emperor Hirohito, in 1971, actually awarded Fellers with one of Japan's highest honors, the Second Order of the Sacred Treasure. McArthur, as pompous as he was in real life (some may dispute this, but he did have a streak of it which many 5-star generals did and do have), he was able to engineer a fantastic rebuilding of Japan. I am not sure if he was revengeful, but Jones was great in his role as McArthur and pulled off the enigmatic role with aplomb.

While inaccuracies existed, the film needed these to pull the story together and make it much more appealing. Minor mistakes never took one away from the real story line... getting the investigation of the Emperor to produce either guilt or innocence in prosecuting the war. All other stories involved in this excellent film were superfluous.

While McArthur was quite an egoist, this film shows how he was able to do the right thing and actually be commanding and warm enough at the proper time to almost endear himself to the Emperor. We don't know if their relationship continued and grew, but we do know that Japan was rebuilt to become a peaceful country which is today a very strong economic entity. It is not known what would have occurred if McArthur had botched the job or if someone else had been in-charge, but Japan was rebuilt and blossomed in spite of the rubble as a result of the war.

I fully recommend this film as a sleeper and one definitely worth your time. It is quite well produced in almost every aspect and is a peek through the window as to what happened after Japan surrendered.",1425859200,,1978,4.5322128851540615
5762268,1,B00CZB9BE8,"The issue regarding the Japanese Emperor only provides a backdrop for a pseudo-lovestory/social commentary.  I should have known better when Tommy Lee's MacArthur threw curses around like wrapped candy (the General had a well-known reputation for NOT swearing,) but I thought this film might be like a Korean saguek drama where they take a historical event and slightly tweak the facts to make it more interesting.  Instead, it appears the entire film was tweaked to create non-existant ""facts.""  I tried to keep an open mind but the film quickly deteriorated into ridiculousness.  Case in point:  Fellers harps on the concern that there will be ""mass suicides"" if Hirohito is executed.  Seriously?  You just dropped an atomic bomb on these people and you're concerned about suicide?  The entire film is like that.  Perhaps it was done intentionally to show the ignorance of US diplomacy and the arrogance of Feller's claiming to understand the Japanese people while totally missing the point.  But it makes no clear statement of such but instead gets mired in a romance that never was... Neither on film nor in real life.  This is simply anti-war film that does nothing to enlighten it's audience. There are few Japanese characters who seem to have taken the atomic bomb, the deaths of their family members and the arrival of the US military all in stride.  Although these issues are presented, they are never explored.  The Japanese people appear like cardboard cut-outs in this one-sided, so-called ""drama"".  Although Feller's attempts to meet with the Emperor provide some interesting moments, it's really just a historical reenactment of details from a textbook. The US military could have easily raided the palace and dragged him out -- as was done to the Emperors of previous dynasties -- but that's not what really happened.  Yes, now the film wants to use facts.  But only enough to provide Feller's character with another foundation for pretentious excuses and platitudes.  The film misses it's moment then to make it clear to the audience that no matter what Feller, MacArthur, or even the President of the US did -- the Japanese would continue to view the US Military and the American people as barbarians!  So you can spend nearly two hours watching this film go nowhere, or you can just take my word for it.  But don't say I didn't warn you.",1425859200,2,2355,4.9465648854961835

I have a hard time visualizing the admittedly few generals I've ever met getting drunk and getting involved in a bar fight.

It shows that any war is never one sided. Cultural clashes happen everywhere. Sometimes it's an emperor revered by his people as a god,sometimes it is religion. Sometimes it is just plainly cultural. Misunderstandings.
Ego's are hard to control, when one is given great powers.
Although they worked with a lot of blue screens and it was mostly filmed in New Zealand,it is very well done.
The devastation created by the atomic bomb was kept to a minimal, in showing it..It showed the bombing before the bomb was dropped which was extensive.

5762331,3,B00CZB9BE8,"Not what I thought it would be.  I was expecting the movie to really focus on the relationship between MacArthur and Hirohito but the film focused more on Bonner Fellers, an American military officer, who was looking for his lost love who happens to be Japanese.  They met in the States before the war and now that he is in Japan he tries to find out if she survived.  It would have been more interesting if it had more of a focus on MacArthur.  You do get some insight into Japanese culture and the importance of the Emperor to their society.",1423612800,,543,4.346534653465347

5762335,3,B00CZB9BE8,"Like my father and brother I have been a World War II buff since a child. At 58 I did find this movie reveal some interesting historical facts about McArthur I did not know such as the Christian humility he displayed upon his arrival and trusting Japan soldiers while his own went unarmed. Fascinating. Almost as jaw dropping was his sincere desire to restore Japan, which history has substantiated.
  Nevertheless, the introduction to the film was pitiful. The length of the movie could easily have handled a 10 minute recap of the Pacific War. Where was the signing of the peace treaty on The Missouri. How about some references to The Death March on Bataan? We're into the second generation of Americans, who have no overall knowledge of the history of America's history with Japan or Japaneese atrocities in the war.

I'm not a huge fan of Matthew Fox and Tommy Lee Jones is about a 50/50 bet as far as I'm concerned, but this movie was very interesting and kept a steady pace.

5762426,2,B00CZB9BE8,I like the actors.  Their performance is excellent.  But the emperor should not get away with his war crime committed against other countries.  The crimes were committed long before the Pearl Harbor which conveniently missing from the general's investigation.  It would be a better film if it just talking about romantic relation between an American man and a Japanese girl.

If the first part sounds exciting, its not. That portion of the plot just serves as the vehicle to deliver the love story which wasn't all that interesting. My biggest gripe with this film is the title and how heavily Tommy Lee Jones as Gen. MacArthur is promoted on the poster and the trailer. You would think this was film about him and the immediate days after the Japanese surrender. Its not. While he has a couple of really good scenes, Tommy Lee Jones' screen time for the entire film probably amounts to about 4 mins and is merely a supporting actor. The ""star"" of the film is the guy standing in the middle at the bottom of the poster.  ""Pearl Harbor"" was the first to dupe us by advertising a war drama and instead delivered a horribly acted, insipid love story and this movie is just more of the same.",1417996800,,1111,4.555

The viewer is pulled back and forth between a love story and the historical background of Japan immediately following the end of WW2.  One gets dizzy watching the main character deal with both.  I decided to watch this film because of the title.  I am very interested in the history of post war Japan, especially the role of General McArthur.  What you get is General McArthur played like Agent K (Men In Black), and a main character with little substance.  This would have been a better film if it had concentrated on the love story, or the decision to retain Japan's emperor when everyone in the USA wanting him hung.  I actually gave up eventually and decided to watch something else.  I feel bad because the intent of the filmmakers was a good one.

5762503,2,B00CZB9BE8,"This film about an important subject is dishonest in several ways,  but I haven't yet seen a discussion of its biggest historical distortion.

I agree with previous comments that the made-up love story is kind of false, and a concession to commercial marketing needs. Similarly, the stilted, eat-your-castor-oil-it's-good-for-you dialogues seem to have been written by a committee rather than by a dramatic author.  Little is told us about the protagonist, besides his nonexistent love affair with a pretty Japanese girl, perhaps because in real life he might have been someone harder for some of us to like and admire (he was a hard-rightwinger, and became a member of the John Birch Society, ew).

The biggest distortion, however, has to do with the investigation of Emperor Hirohito's participation in the Japanese war effort. The film makes it look like an honest effort by General X to find the truth.  The reality, however, was probably more like ""the fix is on."" Mitigating circumstances/pretexts had to be found so that Hirohito would not be brought to trial and not be hanged. Such a fix was probably a political necessity, in order to avoid postwar rebellion and chaos, but telling the actual  story of an inside job and partial coverup would have made for a grimmer and darker scenario then the sunnier but largely dishonest one we see.

This director's previous film, about Vermeer and the pearl earing, was a small masterpiece. I am sorry he stumbled this time. Better luck, and better choice of scenario, in the future!",1414972800,2,1533,4.988235294117647

5762606,2,B00CZB9BE8,"Alternates between being tedious and cheesy. As a historical drama it has a promising topic: the decision about whether to charge Emperor Hirohito for war crimes, but this fascinating material it is treated so poorly by the screenwriters that it is almost unwatchable. Scenes often feel rushed or unnecessarily overdramatic. Often the most important plot moments are rushed through so that they can have yet another discussion about bland generalities. Another issue with the script is that they felt the need to throw in a pointless and unconvincing ahistorical love story. This side plot consumes more and more of the time as the film progresses.

The acting in the film ranges from decent to dreadful. Tommy Lee Jones is as fun as ever, even though he seems far too old to play MacArthur. The problem is that he's barely in the film despite the prominence given to him in the marketing. I was also never able to forget that he was performing since he seemed to have a hard time getting under MacArthur's skin and fleshing him out. Matthew Fox is just impossibly flat in the lead. There is nothing good to be said about his performance except that the script never gave him a chance. The Japanese performances are generally better, but the acting and staging of the film feels more like a tv miniseries than a movie. And an '80s miniseries at that. The look of post-war Tokyo is sometimes disturbingly convincing and at others blatantly computer generated. Again, it feels like a tv miniseries.

Some of the worst scenes for me were where the lead was being lectured about why Japanese war crimes weren't so bad. A military guy having just served in WW2 being told that his actions are equal in cruelty to Japan's is not just going to sit quiet and take it (especially if he is in charge of arresting war criminals). Yes, it would be hard to argue the justice of such destruction with a penniless refugee sitting in the shattered ruins of the house that you bombed (always the unjustifiable victims), but this conversation takes place in the fancy country estate of a wealthy politician. You cannot imagine how little I was moved by his self-justification, and a soldier who lived through it is likely to take it far less well than me.

This scene is followed up by criticisms that Japan was merely doing what the West was doing so what did they do wrong? I don't care whether that's a valid point, as a character moment it rings utterly false because he just takes it. No argument, no justifications, no nothing. So you'd assume from this that he's a kind of quiet pacifist, yet at other moments in the film he appears to be aggressive, opinionated, and warlike (which I suspect is more accurate). He even displays some of the fire for his cause that was so noticeably absent here. It isn't that he has conflicting feelings about Japan, it's that his character is a completely blank slate primed to receive dialog and only has a personality when the screenwriters remember to give him one.

The issue of Japanese war guilt has always irked me because it remains so taboo a subject. There are many films about German war atrocities, some about Italian, several about the Soviets, and even some about American ones (especially the A-Bombs). But in Japanese war films it is always about coequal guilt. And foreign filmmakers have followed suit. A review for this film in the Japan Times pointed out the firebombing discussion as a highlight, asking how the ""aerial terror-bombing"" of Nanking was a war crime when the firebombing of Tokyo which killed over 100,000 people was not. Note the absence of numbers given for Nanking, which is convenient because (despite occasional Japanese denials) the numbers killed were 200-300,000. And it wasn't bombings but the atrocities carried out by the ground forces that get people so upset. Ground forces were responsible for almost all the civilian deaths through such wonderful methods as summary executions, gang rape with a bayonet, and tying up civilians for use as live bayonet practice. And yes, there are many revolting pictures of this so it isn't just hearsay. Now this film didn't have to dwell exclusively on this, or make all Japanese out to be villains, but how you can have a film about war guilt and then ignore the question of what they were guilty of is beyond me. The closest they come is in showing pictures of Japanese soldiers executing captives, and they only show those so that the lead can order them removed from the man's desk. They dodge the issue and in so doing remove any urgency or importance from the plot.

The one positive thing to come out of this film for me is that a reviewer of this film recommended a Russian film called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sun/dp/B00B99PTFC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sun</a>&nbsp;instead. It deals with the same topic (though from Hirohito's point of view) and is supposed to be really good. So hopefully that will pan out.",1411257600,3,4986,4.868080094228504

Instead it turned into this schmalzy silly love story sub plot or really main plot.  Tommy Lee Jones was very good as Gen Macarthur but more time was spent on one of his Army Gen aids who spent more time looking for his Japanese love then doing his job.  Why ruin a potentially good movie with the same Hollywood ""chic flick"" plot.

5762651,2,B00CZB9BE8,"History is written by the victors. In the case of ""Emperor,"" the victors were the choreographers and set designers. This is an beautifully filmed movie. The decimated Japanese cities paint a dark veil over the picturesque and lush Japanese countryside. That alone makes the film tolerable. Unfortunately, that's about where it ends. The acting was decent, but not spectacular. Matthew Fox is a good actor, but it takes more than decent acting chops to bring a dull story to life. He missed the mark on this one. Tommy Lee Jones adds a much needed shot of energy to the film. However, when he's not on screen, the movie deflates into a muddy mix of an Imperial investigation and a love story that seems to fall flat in it's attempt to make the audience care about the personal life of the main character.

The central theme of the movie bears scrutiny as well. It is a little known part of history following the Second World War. Should the United States prosecute, dethrone or hang Emperor Hirohito for war crimes, or enlist his help in rebuilding Japan? It is an interesting concept, but this investigation and the fate of one maneven one believed by his people to be a living godseems trivial when surrounded by such much post war death and destruction. It almost seems like the filmmakers should have been filming something else. Maybe next time they will.",1410393600,,1359,4.734177215189874

Perhaps the movie is best at showing the fragile nature of the U.S. occupation. The U.S. had to establish a working relationship with the Japanese bureaucracy in order to maintain order and implement desired changes in Japanese government and society. The U.S. occupation force was far too small, and knowledge of Japanese language, government, and society too narrowly distributed among U.S. personnel to govern effectively.",1408579200,,696,5.327272727272727

5762747,3,B00CZB9BE8,"There are two emperors in this story: Douglas MacArthur and Hirohito, one the victor, the other the vanquished.  Should Hirohito be hanged or not?  One way to make the choice is on whether or not Hirohito played a significant part in the decision making of Japan's slide into militarism and war and war crimes.  The other way to make the choice is political.  The Japanese people had for the most part accepted their country's surrender to the Allies and to the occupation of their country that followed.  However, they still revered their emperor, and if he were hanged, would they revolt and make the occupation hell for the Allies?  Woven into this story is the love affair between an American man and a Japanese woman that predated the onset of war, perhaps an allegory for what might have been had not the events which led to war happened.

I gave the movie 3 stars because it was entertaining.  It did not engage me in a way that drew me in and make me feel as if I was participating.

Movie stays very close to actual events and the US' s plan to preserve peace in post war Japan in not indicting Emperor Hirohito for war crimes. Movie drags in places due to it being more intent to hold close to history.  A good film for WWII history buffs.,1408060800,,448,4.397590361445783

You must see Tommy Lee Jones as General MacArthur. One of his best performances ever!
Decent story-line but fails to properly combine a love-story genera like The Notebook with a crime investigation genera like Colombo.

The sub plot, which is at the heart of the movie is a detailed story about the love affair of the youthful investigating General that heads the investigation for McArthur and a beautiful Japanese girl. Their affair began before the War when she was studying in America. There are a lot of flash backs interspersed with the young general's attempts to find her in the vast destruction left after the war.

5762786,1,B00CZB9BE8,"This is a movie with a story and cast that could have been outstanding. Unfortunately it fails on so many levels. The story follows General Fellers (played by Matthew Fox) and his frankly bumbling investigation of whether the Emperor of Japan should be tried for war atrocities. Which brings me to the worst part of the movie in my opinion: a complete lack of understanding of Japanese culture displayed by Fellers despite flashback after flashback attempting to show him as the Japan ""expert."" I mean, he wears his shoes INDOORS during his first meeting with a Japanese official. Give me a break!

General McArthur; while well cast in Tommy Lee Jones, is shown as simply vain and ambitious till the final scene. The historical McArthur is a much more interesting character than is eluded to in this movie.

There are so many potential topics that the movie could have used to create an epic: the US occupation and McArthur's push for a new Japanese constitution, truly showcasing Japanese culture and how the war was a manipulation of it, how the Emperor and his circle acted to preserve the monarchy, and so on...

Bottom line - if you are the least bit educated about the time period and the actual historical events that took place, you'll be let down. Go read James Webb's novel The Emperor's General for better historical fiction in this period.",1407369600,7,1351,4.789699570815451

5762792,5,B00CZB9BE8,"Excellent behind the scenes intrigue. It certainly was not all about Tommy Lee Jones, and that's okay because the plot was fantastic and true. Loved it. We should have learned from this heart-wrenching, but positive experience in Japan and carried it forward to the Middle East and other areas.  Quite educational and entertaining.",1407369600,,331,5.245283018867925
5762793,3,B00CZB9BE8,"A bland look at an intriguing moment in history.  The subject of the movie is a fascinating episode of the World War II era and well worth attention. All the parts are well-cast, Tommy Lee Jones is a good fit for MacArthur and Matthew Fox is fine in the central role, but somehow the characters and the movie is flat. A lot of narration is used where interaction between the characters could have been used to advance the story or give background. The love story is a good addition but again, falls flat. The major conflict of the story between Fox's character and another American general seems like a girl fight and the only real fight in the movie is the result of Fox wandering around ruined Tokyo looking for sake to slake his mild anxiety. A good movie that I probably won't watch again.",1407283200,,793,4.468965517241379
5762794,4,B00CZB9BE8,"A very interesting look at a critical point in our history, that we take for granted today.  The story kept me interested throughout the movie with the romantic love that was never meant to be plot and the inside look at Japanese culture and how it was changed by World War II.  It had a few moments where the pace of the movie slowed and I thought Tommy Lee Jones made a passable Douglas MacArthur, but was otherwise unimpressed with his performance.  I thought Matthew Fox and Eriko Hatsune stole the show.  Overall if you have an interest in the history of World War II and the cultural influences that motivate a people to war and to peace, and can stand a romantic story line that never quite culminates, then you will probably enjoy this movie as I did.",1407283200,,759,4.438848920863309

The acting was a little below par but the story of Hirohito's complicity is the real story and comes through very well.  Japan is a complex society with many undertones and this fact comes through very clearly.

5762866,2,B00CZB9BE8,"There is still much controversy over the culpability of Hirohito for the wars Japan started in the 1930s and for Pearl Harbor, and for the extremely brutal behavior of Japanese troops. Some, like this movie, suggest that he was largely a passive figurehead. Others, like a humongous biography which came out a few years ago, charge him with a much more active role and insist he should have been tried as a war criminal. As the case was unclear in 1945, there was surely no good reason why he should not have been tried so that actual evidence, supported by the sworn testimony of participants with actual knowledge, could have been adduced. Then, if there was no proof beyond a reasonable doubt of his guilt, he could have been properly exonerated; or, of course, if there was such proof, he could have been hanged like other Japanese and German war criminals at the end of World War II.

What this movie suggests is that the man who made the decision not to try Hirohito was unduly influenced by an American expert on Japan whose love for that country, and especially for the love of his life who died in an Allied bombing raid, at best compromised his objectivity, at worst put his loyalty to the U.S. in question. Now, General MacArthur knew General Fellers well, and was fully familiar with his knowledge of and affection for Japan; and if MacArthur put this momentous decision entirely in Fellers hands, it was obviously for the purpose of giving MacArthur cover for a decision he had already made but which would be very unpopular at home. As for the love story, it is apparently pure fiction, as Fellers was married in 1925 and was accompanied by his wife in his foreign postings. The girl is very pretty indeed, but the flashbacks became increasingly annoying, and even if true were overdone  one romp through the bamboo woods was more than enough, the second was as irritating as a repeated commercial; that they were not true certainly compounds the offense.

Then there was the 10-day deadline for investigating such a complex issue involving a near invisible person, intensely loyal followers, and a difficult foreign language and culture, and coming to a conclusion which would affect the conduct and possibly the outcome of the occupation. That was utterly implausible; had such an order been given, MacArthur, who never showed much deference to decisions from Washington (he was ultimately dismissed in 1951 by President Truman for overt insubordination), would never have accepted so manifestly inadequate a deadline; and I have read that the actual time which MacArthur took to determine not to try Hirohito was 5 months. After all, as MacArthur arrived in Tokyo as Supreme Commander in September 1945, and the Tokyo War Crimes trials started in May 1946, there was no hurry, certainly no ticking bomb which had to be defused in a mere 10 days.

Two major themes in the movie, then  the love story and the ridiculous deadline  were made up out of whole cloth. How about the rest of the movie? In light of its central fictions, who knows? So, I didn't learn anything from this movie, except perhaps how really exotic, even alien, the Japanese are (or pretended to be, to hoodwink the gullible Americans  and after all, their inscrutable act worked and Hirohito remained on his throne until his death in 1989). Perhaps worst of all for a movie, it was heavy going with not a single hint of wit; and an American general, a personal aide to the Supreme Commander in occupied Japan, getting into a barroom brawl? Please. The saving grace? I cant think of any  except the girl was really, really pretty.",1405900800,,3615,4.7728

5762879,4,B00CZB9BE8,"The movie does a very good job with the historical accuracy with depicting the exoneration of Emperor Hirohito. It is told through the story of General Bonner Fellers who is tasked by General MacArthur to find evidence and conclude whether or not the Emperor is guilty or innocent of war crimes for starting the war. The movie overall is very entertaining and time will fly by very quickly.

As with all movies however, some liberties were taken in this movie. In real life, Fellers does meet a Japanese exchange student in college by the name of Yuri Watanabe (in the movie her character is called Aya Shimada) and she does in fact go back to Japan. Where the movie takes a dramatic licence is at these points (SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!), Watanabe and Fellers were not lovers, they were in fact very good friends, Watanabe did not go back to Japan unexpectedly because her father was ill, Watanabe owned the school she taught at, Watanabe did not die in real life she survived the war and was reunited with Fellers when arrived in Japan after the war, Watanabe even gave advice to Fellers which helped him decide whether to exonerate the emperor or to pursue charges against him. (END SPOILERS)

In the end while the love story seems very cliched in the movie it does help lighten the mood despite the despair and suffering of the Japanese that is depicted in the movie.

TL;DR: Entertaining movie depicting the investigation of Emperor Hirohito during the occupation of Japan. Follows the story of how General Fellers made a decision of the fate of the emperor and his search for his Japanese lover who was in Japan during the war.",1405814400,,1626,4.71830985915493

5762961,4,B00CZB9BE8,"Does anyone else think Tommy Lee Jones always seems like the same character in every movie no matter who he's supposed to be portraying? I think George C. Scott captured Patton so well that it seemed that a better job of portraying another swashbuckler general would have been a plum role for someone. Gregory Peck was a little better but I'm still waiting for someone who really can do MacArthur well. I thought Matthew Fox who stars as General Bonner Fellers, an Army officer who, after WWII, is tasked with deciding whether Japans Emperor Hirohito will be hanged as a war criminal really carried the movie then again is appears in virtually every scene. I grew curious about Matthew Fox's character and wanted to know more about him and why he was demoted after the war...fascinating story...Google General Bonner Fellers... would like to see that as a movie.",1404777600,,862,4.831081081081081

Tommy Lee Jones does a good characature of MacArthur with his vanity and crudeness on display.  Nothing new there.  The story is of ten days to decide the fate of the Emperor for his role in the war.  Improbable as it seems this is primarily decided by the influence of a man who had fallen in love with a Japanese woman before the war and his ability speak Japanese while searching for his lost love,1404691200,,513,4.483870967741935

There was little mention of the hundreds of thousands allied soldiers that  would be killed if there was land invasion instead.  The Japanese people had a religious obligation to kill all Invaders. An invasion would have been terribly costly.

There was a stiff unreal sense of the portrayal of events.  Although Jones's acting was fine.",1404604800,,546,4.923076923076923

5762987,3,B00CZB9BE8,"A good story of the first few weeks of the American occupation of Japan and the various facets that had to be combined to make the process work.  The story of Bonner Fellers was one part of this process and it is told as a part of this movie.  Yet I, for one, found it was  a distraction.  I would much rather have seen a closer focus on MacArthur and his struggle to make his occupation start off on a satisfactory basis.  Fellers had a role in this but I think the romantic aspect, much of it contrived it seems, undermines the larger story of what was taking place in those first few weeks.

Some aspects of the movie`s historical basis are done well.  The drive from Atsugi to Yokohama is shown well, with the road lined on both sides by Japanese soldiers who about face when MacArthur's fleet of cars drive by, as a sign of respect.  The meeting between MacArthur and Emperor Showa is well done.  The efforts to either prosecute or ignore the Emperor`s role in the events leading up to the start of the war and then its conduct, is a key aspect that could have done with greater detail.

As entertainment the movie does it well but as to delivering historical accuracy to a period in US-Japanese relations, it does little to raise the level of understanding that period.  A viewer of this film is advised to study the history of the period to get a better understanding of the events taking place and the peopleinvolved in them.",1404518400,2,1433,4.4106463878327

My responsibilities during my penultimate tour there included holding quarterly staff meetings with senior officers of the Japan Maritime Defense Force (their highly competent navy). By happenstance I was in Tokyo the day Hirohito passed and had a first-hand view of the national mourning that ensued. There are two complexities that I have personally observed that I think this movie highlights, but doesn't provide much detail. First is the multilayered nature of Japanese culture: the differences between what one observes in Japan and what often actually lies beneath the surface.  Second is the sometimes challenging relationship between very senior officers and their immediate subordinates, especially if the senior is as brilliant, complex and ambitious as MacArthur was. Finally, on an entertainment level, I thought both Tommy Lee Jones and Matthew Fox were superb in their respective roles.

5763049,2,B00CZB9BE8,"Until this rating request arrived, I'd forgotten the movie. It is some director's or writer's opinion of post war Japan and the ever present Hollywood 1) cultural relativism and 2) disdain for everything and everybody American. They seemed to have expected men who had just fought a very bloody war against a very hard enemy. That enemy also tortured, massacred and did things quite comparable to the Germans. Americans don't know this. As with Germany, we wanted an ally in those areas so, except for some Germans, the war crimes were buried and are now forgotten. That's ok with me, I am fine with accepting that only a Japanese ruling faction was maniacal and I know Japan had reasons. Anyway, this movie presents none of that dilemma. No, instead we have a pretty dumb cross-cultural love story that is utterly forgettable. This goes on my list of movies made by Hollywood people who must get their opinions from other Hollywooders sitting in expensive restaurants complaining about minimum wage. They simply pick up what some ""in"" people are saying and either do little research or don't have the education to understand the sociology and anthropology of two cultures meeting like this.

5763054,5,B00CZB9BE8,This made for screen is a very accurate history of the  failed attempt by the hard liners in the Japan military to block the peace process by the emperor of Japan in 1945.  The story however is on the US side and the determination of one person to stop the retribution of Washington DC.,1403740800,,286,4.277777777777778
5763055,3,B00CZB9BE8,Decent move but not about what I was thinking.  The cove prominently shows Tommy Lee Jones making you think he is the main character but he is not.  It also gives the illusion the movie would be about McAurthur's governing of Japan after the war but it is not.  From a pure entertainment stand point I would give it 4 stars but I can only give it 3 because of the obvious lack of budget and the bait and switch between the cover image and the actual movie content.,1403740800,,464,4.191011235955056

5763057,5,B00CZB9BE8,"This film snuck by with little fanfare, yet is a solid piece of work. It's less about WWII than about the aftermath in Japan and General MacArthur's questioning whether the Emperor should be tried and hung as complicit in starting the war, or whether he should participate in the reconstruction of Japan.  Woven into a love story against the background of post war Japan, this film is intelligent even if Tommy Lee does overact a little.  It's a film to be seen.",1403740800,,462,4.621951219512195

I knew nothing about General Bonner Fellers assignment to MacArthur's staff. I noted the humanity of all the characters, each with his or her point of view as to how Japan dealt with its surrender. No one in the United States Government at the time that the war ended understood the Japanese psychic as well as General MacArthur did. It took guts for Emperor Hirohito to meet with General MacArthur in the end - he was so human.

Tommy Lee Jones has a very small role in this film.  I expected much more from him since he is on the cover.

This movie is more about a love story between a American soldier and a Japanese girl than the Emperor.  The deal behind the exoneration of the Japanese Emperor is what interests me.  I know this is a movie not a history book but I didn't expect it to be so far off the subject.

5763077,3,B00CZB9BE8,"The movie is centered on postwar Japan, late 1945, early 1946. It focuses on MacArthur's attempts to get Japan to reform while meting out punishment to Japanese leaders who committed war crimes. The key question he tries to answer is whether Emperor Hirohito should bear responsibility for some of those war crimes. The general that he assigns to do research to answer this question is Bonner Fellers. The movie is split between Fellers' attempts to find out the truth from various Japanese leaders and his recollection of his relationship with a Japanese woman. As far as I can tell from a variety of sites on the Internet, General Fellers had no such relationship. I guess some viewers would find a film without romantic intrigue boring, so they added it in there. I, as an English teacher, have a high threshold for boredom, so I would have liked a more historically accurate film. I won't tell you how the movie ends. I think it is worth watching on DVD or streaming online, but I don't know if it merits plunking down 10 dollars at your local movie theater.",1403222400,,1062,4.684491978609626

The love situation between an American General and the daughter of a Japanese military officer is highly unrealistic and distracting.  I guess there always has to be this love situation between a smart, big, brave, handsome, Caucasian, American military officer and a pretty Japanese woman.  Remember the movie Midway.  If there has to be a love situation why not something that was very typical of the time, the American military man and his American home grown all American girl joining him in marriage and in Japan?

That is post war Japan, immediately at the end of the war.
Insight that that shows why MacArthur was such a great leader.
In fact a very important part of history as things could have turned out much costlier for the US if not handled his way and with his insight into the people of Japan.
Tommy Lee Jones was great in his role as the Emperor.  Matthew Fox gave great clarity to the vision MacArthur used.

The movie poster/trailer/synopsis is a bit misleading. There's not enough Tommy Lee Jones! MacArthur is a background character. (Although, Jones does a terrific job getting MacArthur's mannerisms across.) One, nearly fatal, flaw: this is based on a true story focusing on a real general. The ""love story"" that is woven throughout the movie doesn't work. It's implausible; it's not necessary; and it's not even remotely true. It's a distractor from the real story.

5763227,5,B00CZB9BE8,"While the romance between Bonner Fellers and a young Japanese college student is probably a Hollywood twist with a very, very remote truth, the movie seemed rather historically accurate.  From Internet research it is clear that Fellers did protect Hirohito and prevented him being tried a criminal.  While Eisenhower did not like Fellers, he was depicted as a competent
officer, which I assume he was.  He was demoted at the end of the war to colonel as part of the military downsizing, not because Eisenhower did not like him.  he was one of some 212 Brigadiers demoted to colonels.  His retirement rank was later reinstated to brigadier.  Ignore the romance part and you have a good movie about the occupation I think.

Behind all the rhetorics by the general and tales from the ministers, the answer shouldn't be unclear once you learn the essence of the culture. Devotion, ""loyalty and obedience to their masters have been the warriors code for 2000 years"".

Selfish is an obvious vice, however, selfless is the ingredient of true evil force of mankind when the faithfuls are guided together towards the 'divine' purpose. They can sacrifice themselves for that purpose and ""commit unspeakable crimes"" in the name of the good. Who will remember and think over former prime minister's history lesson to the general?

5763244,3,B00CZB9BE8,"The trailer portrayed more action from Tommy Lee Jones, but he only comes out very few time and the film is mostly about Matthew Fox looking for his long lost lover and be charge of the investigation of the war criminal with any possible link to the Emperor.

History-wise, well... it is what it is. The Hirohito was never set on trial for any war crime, and later took a step down from being the godliness position in Japan. Because he was never tried as a war criminal, the rest of the Asian continents and parts of Europe were infuriated by the decision made by the US.

However, if you were to step on the General's shoe, and if Hirohito was to be trialed for war crime and being executed, then the nation of Japan would've gone unrest, and Japan would've been in situation similar to what's going on in Iraq today. Note that Americans are also trying to compete their model example of superiority from the Soviets and their rising communist states.  Anyway, that's just my opinion.

5763247,5,B00CZB9BE8,I enjoyed this movie a lot. Tommy Lee Jones is an accomplished actor. The story is riveting and it tells the human part of a horrible war and the suffering of the regular people who are just want to go about doing their day to day business. This movie shows how the people of Japan suffered and the destruction we did with the bombing of Tokyo and the surrounding cities. Excellent movie. Very highly recommended.,1401580800,,413,4.52
5763248,3,B00CZB9BE8,"As other reviews will mention, this movie, despite featuring a picture of ""MacArthur"" on the front is really a docudrama on the process by General Bonner Fellers of getting down to the nitty-gritty of Japanese Emperor Hirohito's role in the Japanese part of the 2nd World War.  What I felt was the major problem in this movie was trying to tell the romantic story of Fellers and his relationship with a Japanese woman and use it as a vehicle for helping us understand his love of Japan.  That part of the story was long, drawn out, and frankly, extremely boring, especially when someone starts watching the film thinking it's going to be, if not wholly, at least MOSTLY about MacArthur.

I can think of better titles right off the top of my head (Nihon Blame Game) and cover pictures for the movie which wouldn't set those among us who feel very strongly about MacArthur, be it love or hate, completely befuddled when watching the movie, waiting for Tommie Lee Jones (who was, at most, a bit player in the film as MacArthur) to dazzle us with his performance as MacArthur.

Now, through all this, even after all the things that ticked me off, I came off really enjoying the film, or at LEAST the parts which showed just how shrewd MacArthur was in his understanding of how to rebuild Japan, and how Fellers' played a major role in helping MacArthur understand just how much he could or could not count upon the Emperor. As others have said, the last scene in the film, the one where MacArthur finally meets and uses brilliant political savvy to both let Hirohito know MacArthur didn't see him as a god, and wasn't going to treat him as one, but at the same time using the words that so good leaders use so often when trying to let others know they don't consider themselves to be above their followers:  ""I need your help.""

Pull out the romantic garbage, focus more upon just how MacArthur had gone about rebuilding Japan and you'd have had an easy 5 star movie.  Instead we're left with a movie which is confused in its message and purpose.  It's worth watching for those interested in Japan right after American occupation, but if you're looking for some great insight into MacArthur as a leader (as in the book ""American Ceasar""), skip it, unless you can watch it for free through Amazon Prime, in which case, skip the romantic scenes.  They have exceedingly little to do with the entire film.",1401580800,5,2397,4.594847775175644

5763251,4,B00CZB9BE8,"There are a range of opinions here about this movie, some wanting it to be more historical, with more MacArthur, and others who thought the pre-war romance between a young Japanese woman and the general investigating the emperor added to the texture of the movie.  Note that the historical part of it would not have taken place as it did without the romance, and the pre-war interest and expertise in Japanese culture of the general that MacArthur was wise enough to appoint.  I did find the romance, and the flashbacks, to be a little distracting at first, and wanted to see more Tommy Lee Jones as MacArthur, but by the end of the movie it all seemed to to fit.  Maybe the story could have been told better, and maybe more interesting actors could have been cast instead of the ones chosen (Tommy Lee Jones excepted), but the story was told well.  It held my attention, and I didn't feel disappointed at the end.  MacArthur was presented as a person who loved being photographed, but the truth is that he did, and for good reason; overall, MacArthur was depicted as what he was, a war hero, and a man who knew how to select the proper people to get things done.

We actually demonstrated that we wanted a long-lasting peace by helping Japan save face in a critical issue which laid the groundwork for working together to help Japan restructure its society and industry to become the constructive world power that it is today.

5763284,4,B00CZB9BE8,"First let me make it clear that I enjoyed the film. It is very interesting. But the filmmakers tried to make two very different movies here. There is the story about the need to determine if the emperor should stand trial for war crimes and a love story. The two stories don't mesh well. As a result, we get a very firm deadline of ten days to save the emperor and how it's not enough time, followed by a lot of slow moving flashbacks and mooning around related to the love story. Each are interesting and compelling in their own right. I just wish they'd focused on one or the other. As it is, the love story detracts from and overpowers what should be the primary story of saving the emperor.",1401321600,,694,4.305343511450381

Jones is too big of a star for the role as written. But it really wasn't presented as Mcarthur's story. Mathew Fox  was very good. If you like this period in history, give it four stars. Not for viewers short on historical interest in period, although they wrote Mcathur's part as if it was made for low history  I Q.

Today's events and personalities in contemporary America clearly point to Oligarchism existing in the background and which had been identified and depowered with the American Revolution, now this Oligarchism is realling its ugly and genocidal head  specifically in the 29-1st centuries. It is within this context that we can understand the contemporary world dramas - WWI,II and preparation of WWIII (Thermonuclear). The film identified some aspects that are usually hid from public consideration. Here we see personalities that have attempted to redirect cryptic oligarchical policies and objectives.",1401148800,,806,5.5

I am a Tommy Lee Jones fan and I thought he did a great job as McArthur.  As I remember the history, the movie was quite accurate.  I do not know if the younger general played a factual role but he was very good also. EMPEROR is a movie about the occupation of Japan by the U.S. at the end of World War II.  Since many of my generation were in that war any movie of that period is of interest to me.

5763336,4,B00CZB9BE8,Pretty good historical movie. A love story no one really knew about until this story was told by the film. I am a fan of Matthew Fox and Tommy Lee. My dad was on Tinian when the bomb was loaded and took off from there. I was actually deployed there for a field exercise in the late 90's and got to see the pit they used to load the bomb on the aircraft. Over all good movie.,1401148800,,374,3.8701298701298703

Movie portrays the investigation into whether the Emperor should be charged with war crimes in WW2.  The movie slowed down with the love story but you get through it. The last scene of Gen M. and the Emperor was moving.

I was moved by what the movie portrayed as the almost total destruction of Tokyo. I don't know how factual that was. I was there 14 years after the war ended and I don't recall seeing any areas that we're not rebuilt. I am aware that Gen M did an amazing job turning the country around and rebuilding it.

Well surprise, surprise Gomer it's not about MacArthur, and Tommy Lee is relegated to, at best, a supporting character.  Now glance at the picture to the left.  Hmmm.  The very interesting real story is about the decision to put Emperor Hirohito on trial as a war criminal.  Jones appears sparingly throughout the film.

As to the film itself, it's pretty well done.  The scenery is really looks like 1945 Tokyo, the music is excellent (a'la Philip Glass but not Philip Glass), and the film gave good insight to the problems facing both sides immediately after the war.

5763368,4,B00CZB9BE8,"The tough decision of which Japanese overlords should be accused of war crimes and executed is at the core of this work. The decision is to be made by General MacArthur whose presidential ambitions lead him to trust the judgment of General Fellows, a man who is fluent in Japanese culture but whose earlier romance with a Japanese girl colors his decisions. The acting is superb, but as in many films, flash-backs are not always designated as flash-backs, and the viewer has to judge which period we are in only by the clothes of the hero.

5763377,2,B00CZB9BE8,"Being a diehard fan of General Douglas MacArthur, I was looking forward to seeing this movie and how he would be portrayed by Tommy Lee Jones. Having known the man in charge of MacArthur's Inchon operation, as well as the General's Russian niece and a World War II historian who had interviewed MacArthur (and was admittedly more taken with General Marshall); and having read various accounts by MacArthur's friends and foes, and, of course, his autobiography -- I was disappointed in this film. First, I expected it to be more about the events leading up to MacArthur's meeting with the Emperor. Instead, the General made only a few appearances and I never could shake the feeling of this being Tommy Lee Jones playing himself, rather than MacArthur. Also, my friend who was with MacArthur at Inchon told me a number of times that while the General could be aggravating at times, such as changing his uniform several times a day, he was always a gentleman. He used vulgarity only when extremely vexed and did not use the f-word in casual speech. Nor would it be like him to talk about dragging someone in by the balls. Gregory Peck captured the General's vainglorious swagger and manner of speaking to a much greater extent than Jones, who failed to understand that MacArthur rarely spoke without considering how what he was saying would look in print -- either in a newspaper or, preferably, in a history book.

I have little doubt that MacArthur had already made up his mind about sparing the Emperor before he even stepped off the plane in Japan. He viewed himself as an expert on the Asian mind and knew he would be reviled in Japan's history should he hang the Emperor. Also, he had warned individual military commanders about the consequences of treating American POWs as they were, starving them and killing them at will. That's why, when he was visited by one of the daughters of a condemned Japanese General, hoping to spare her father's life, he refused, citing his reasons. It was not, as suggested in AMERICAN CAESAR, an arbitrary, capricious decision.

In the end the film was a work of misdirection, setting MacArthur up to look like (at best) a sideshow, completely unwilling to take the decision onto his own shoulders. But we should keep in mind that he was, from the beginning, an outspoken critic of hanging the Emperor. If he selected people who would reach that decision without too much coaching, what's wrong with that? He also kept Japan intact, refusing to divide it with the Soviets as was the State Department's wont. It was MacArthur that put Japan back on its feet, guided them in writing its own constitution based on other great constitutions, including ours. He was the one who brought W. Edwards Deming to Japan and turned Japanese crap into quality products, all without creating an adversarial relationship between management and labor.

In my view, they should have put a picture of General Fellers on the DVD. I'm glad I didn't waste ten bucks on seeing this in a theater.",1400803200,,3010,4.7846153846153845

First of all the role of Macarthur is miscast with a low-class, profane language actor who dosn't come across anything like the real man. Secondly the hero of the story is really out of character as a Brigadier General who is too young for the role.
The story drags on and on while the hero searches for his Japanese girl friend. Somehow manages to drive a jeep 5 hours out of Tokyo to find his girl friend. This in a war-devastated city and countryside where the basic services have not been repaired nor have the roads. One wonders how he buys fuel for 10 hours of jeep driving (in the rain) on bombed out roads through destruction.  When he walks from his quarters to a bar he gets beaten by some surly locals who don't like Americans, yet he goes unescorted on this 5 hour drive with no security...
It is never clear to what the Emperor title is supposed to mean. It is a story about getting the Japanese Emperor to abdicate his power, but MacArthur himself was known as the American Emperor at that time... So which emperor is this really about?

The acting was well done and it made a valid point about the Emperor's involvement in starting World War 2.,1400544000,,264,3.8518518518518516
5763433,4,B00CZB9BE8,I would have given this movie a 5 star rating if the script writer had not tried to rewrite history and take a swing at American exceptionism. There is a discussion about how the Japanese perpetrated genocide and committed atrocities and it is compared to British colonialism and the Spanish Civil War where many American lives were lost in the name of helping the Filipino people. There is also much said about the bombing of Tokyo. People need to know how ruthless the Japanese were with their expansion plans the same as Hitler and Germany. I noticed there was no discussion about how navy nurses were raped and tortured by the Japanese when they took over American bases not to mention Pearl Harbor. These young screenwriters need to go back to a proper school and get their facts straight.,1400544000,,794,4.719424460431655

I'm fascinated by world war 2. I've studied both theaters of action and this a unique view of the post war peace process. I also thought it presented a far more realistic portrayal of McArthur.,1400457600,,343,4.292307692307692

I really like Tommy Lee Jones, he is a very good actor.",1400284800,,209,4.0
5763460,3,B00CZB9BE8,"So I was sure that this movie would include MacArthur accepting the formal and final Japanese surrender - but it did not???  Wow.

How can you make a movie called the ""Emperor"" about the actual ""surrender"" of Japan in WWII, and not include the actual event itself.  Very lame film making!  This was the major event of the period!  It capped off everything.

Watch the ACTUAL newsreel event here - [...]
 MacArthur gave Japan it's soul back. The nation was torn to pieces and no one was sure what would happen, it was the worst of times - as the film depicts. But MacArthur decides that Japan should not be punished any more.  The final terms of surrender are most significant.  The leader of Japan REMAINED the leader of Japan after the war - this was huge - the public response in Japan was overwhelming.  Perhaps the director just did not know his History - as he misses the entire enchilada.

Also - the movie is over 50% soap opera - and not focused on MacArthur at all -  and how that plays out is just underwhelming to me.

Why this director decided to direct this particular movie - and leave so much out of it - unknown.",1400284800,,1128,4.365384615384615

5763466,2,B00CZB9BE8,"While this film is well acted and shot, I felt the pro Japanese- anti American slant became a two hour attempt at Revisionist History. The most revealing scene was the debate in which a Japanese man claims there was no difference between their Imperial attempts over South East Asia and that of England, Spain, and America. No rebuttal is made concerning Death Marches, Pleasure Women, Beheadings, and other Atrocities of the Japanese towards their vanquished peoples.

Bushido is portrayed as a most noble tradition, forgetting its darker side of Institutionalized Brutality. Watch the film, but  bear this in mind",1400198400,6,615,5.202020202020202

The brigadier general  puts himself at risk and was severely beaten as a result, something that strained the ability to suspend disbelief. After MacArthur formed the alliance with Emperor Hirohito, the five-star slipped into the role of emperor himself but for the film referred to himself as ""Supreme Commander.""

He was looking for people who surrounded him who could give him information.  He finally meets the Emperor at the end of the movie.  I recommend it highly.

Luckily this movie wasn't about MacArthur but one of his Generals (General Fellers); while the romantic side seemed out of place, the rest of the movie was incredibly interesting (but lacking in action, which makes sense) and did a good job illustrating how everything was very precarious during the initial occupation of Japan.  Another war could have broken out at any second and the United States had to play the role of peaceful occupier and rebuilder, after decisively crushing the Japanese military; this movie does a good job relaying that to the viewer.",1399939200,,914,4.7421383647798745

5763478,4,B00CZB9BE8,"This movie resonates with me on many levels because my Father served on a B-17 in WWII  & we lived in the Phillippines for a year in 1966 & there were still so many reminders of that war & its many atrocities in that country then -- we passed thru japan on our way there as well & again............the war wasn't that far removed from the hearts & minds of the people. What this movie showed was the struggle between those  who wanted to punish the Japanese & wreak vengeance for their wartime crimes & those who realized that a scorched earth policy when it came to the japanese culture would not get us (America& Europe) what we wanted & needed from that part of the world. Blame had to be assigned, of course, & it was-- but did the Emperor himself give the orders or did his military? Yes this movie is tilted toward the mercy part of the outcome but that doesn;t change the fact that , in the long run, not trying him for war crimes was the right decision. We at least learned that much from the end of WWI. The movie is good at exposing the clash of cultures.....could there be 2 more different cultures than the US and japan in the 1930-40""s??  The movie does not excuse the japanese for their crimes but it does point out that few world powers are guilt free when it comes to taking over & controlling other nations. It was the sheer force of will, probably MacArthur's but also other world leaders, that allowed us to help re-build Japan. No easy task because the one thing this movie did not show clearly is how utterly ruthless the japanese were to other Asian countries -- they treated ALL other cultures as inferior & of no value what-so-ever. They despised other Asians & that feeling was returned 1000x over once Japan lost. So it really was astonishing that we chose to help instead of flattening what was left of that country. We did have the moral high ground & we used it the way it should have been used. History has shown us the value of these choices -- only one of many tough choices & maybe in a more superficial way than it merits but the story is moving, the acting is solid & the ending scene is excellent & may indeed show why MacArthur was THE man for this job even if he was a Sonnofa-B. More likely beCAUSE he was a sonnafa-b. A smart,cunning & long-term thinking sonnafa-b.

5763480,1,B00CZB9BE8,"Hirohito was indeed interviewed soon after the end of the war and his words were published for the public at large after his passing in 1989. He said he feared that if he opposed Pearl Harbor he would be assassinated. Now that right there is subject ot debate. Was the man all of Japan worshiped as a God and a rallying point really that open to plotters and traitors? Did he not have his own Praetorian Guards, a later type of Samurai perhaps, dedicated to protect his life no matter what? We cant know because no real research that you couldn't find in an encyclopedia was done for this film. Could he not have had Tojo and all those suspect arrested? These are the kind of interesting bits of history that could have been introduced into the film, rather then leaving it to ""Hirohito was really a nice guy and whether his hands had the blood of over 2000 serviceman at Pearl Harbor on his hands, while using a version of ""Just following orders"" to ""Just going with the flow to keep my head""

This film could have been a real great study of a man surrounded in mystery, who fiddled in his Garden while the Pacifc burned. The name of this movie after all is ""Emperor"" and we should have been treated to a better bit of history even if Hollywood would obviously throw in its stamp, like the General worried about his onetime girlfriend. What I saw in this movie was griping about the A-Bombs devastating effects, while the General just holds his tongue instead of mentioning that 1100 servicemen who were enjoying a beautiful Sunday morning, suddenly found themselves as combatants in a war they didn't know had till 7:50 Am 12-7-1941, and that if they didn't want Hiroshima and Nagasaki, then they shouldnt have brought it on in the first place and tried to settle the oil issue in some peaceful manner. Sounded all like kowtowing to the ""we were the bad guys for saving American and Japanese lives albeit at great collateral damage.""
The only thing closest to historical truth was the presentation of MacArthur as a pompous climber. When Harry Truman fired him for insubordination in the Korea conflict he said ""I fired MacArthur because he wouldn't respect the office of the President of the United States, not because he was a son of a b***h, but thats not against the law for generals""

On the rare occasions where an historical period piece is actually produced what generally happens is there are far to many plot lines competing for space.
Plot A General MacArthur as the overlord of Japan trying to form a democratic government with or without the help of the existing Japanese power structure at least partially works and is mostly carried through by Tommy Lee Jones who while he is the best part of the movie cannot be everywhere at once,
Plot B Bonner Fellers and the insipid love plot does not work you only meet the love interest in flashbacks and you never actually get the sense that they care for one another I cant be any more creditable then that.
Plot C.  How much did the Japanese Emperor know about the war?  Did he start it?  Could he have ended it sooner?  Interesting idea they should have pushed harder with it.
Plot D.  Just how responsible were the leaders of the Japanese military for their conduct of the war?  An interesting idea that is flirted with for about 10 seconds and then discarded.

5763493,1,B00CZB9BE8,"This movie is so pro Japan and heavily slanted it is not funny. They start the movie with the atomic bombing of Japan. They hardly mention any of the Japanese war atrocities and focus on the Japanese as victims of horrid American bombing. The whole spin is that - poor Japanese were merely following in the West's footsteps in becoming a colonial power. I mean, does that justify what they did?

The movie also cited the reason for the Japanese attacking the Americans was because of the oil embargo imposed by FDR. Nowhere did they mention the reasons for doing so. FDR wanted to force the Japanese out of China peacefully by starving their war machine, not the population. This is but just one example of the blatant attempts of this movie to omit any sense of balance and just present a pro Japanese view of the war.

By the end of the movie, they indicate that the Protagonist was demoted from Brig General to Colonel. No reason was given for his demotion and the implication was because of his recommendation that the Japanese Emperor not be tried for his war crimes. This is another blatant attempt to slant things by omission.  After WW2, 212 generals were demoted because they were raised in rank temporarily during the war. The same position the protagonist was. His rank was temporary.

Unfortunately, he only had about 15 minutes of screen time during the entire movie and I had to spend my time watching Matthew Fox wander around like a refugee from the ""Lost"" set. I had expected to see a movie about MacArthur's relationship with the Japanese Emperor during the occupation. What I got was a bad characterization, and not a historically accurate one either, of Gen Bonner Fellers. Gen Fellers was on MacArthur's staff and was charged with investigating the emperor for war crimes. This opened up the opportunity for some dialog accusing the west of being as big an imperialist power as Japan. And, of course, Gen Fellers had a romantic relationship with a Japanese girl before the war and he used his office to try to find her. His investigation culminated with a description of the attempted coup by the militarists once they learned that the Emperor had made a recording about surrendering to the Americans. This was shown as proof enough that the Emperor had resisted the militarists and was therefore not guilty of war crimes.

The actual history, of course, is more complicated. The government had done several studies on Japanese culture during the war that underscored the need to keep the Emperor in place as a pacifying influence on the population. Keeping him was a central part of the occupation planning.

I can't recommend this movie, even if it does have Tommy Lee Jones. It's not a good love story, it's not historically accurate and Fox is not a good actor.",1387238400,,1541,4.811320754716981
5763515,4,B00CZB9BE8,"This movie tells the story of the US Army JAG teams trying to put together the Pacific theater war crimes indictments in the first month after the Japanese surrender. It centers on the Tokyo HQ team investigating the question as whether the Emperor of Japan should be tried for allowing the Imperial General Staff a free hand in the attack at Pearl Harbor and ensuing events during the war. Movie plot centers on two major American characters, US General Fellows leading the inquest team concerning the Emperor; and General Douglas MacArthur micro-managing his work as well as establishing the occupation forces in Japan in the fall of 1945. Success of the Occupation will balance on the situation regarding the Emperor. This is all interesting, and as we have learned since 1945, this was a difficult situation. Script is based on true events and actual people. Interesting...but hardly exciting. We follow flashbacks in the life of General Fellows as he recalls falling in love with a Japanese woman he met in university and again in subsequent pre-war trips to Japan, and as he attempts to find her again in the bombed-out chaos of 1945 Japan.
 While the movie is interesting and watchable, the viuewer will have to endure some of the most ""unique mis)castings of any movie in a long time!  Matthew Fox ( LOST) as a US Army  general...hmmm. OK, possible...he's in his early 30s now and there were 23 and 24 year old generals in rare cases. Works as 50% of the love interest...and I sort of suspect he owns a share of the film..  Tommy Lee Jones as General of the Army Douglas MacArthur...now that's a bit of a strech to me.. Imperious, aloof, tall, calculating, Virginia ""gentlemanly, were all terms used (among others) to describe MacArthur. Best played on the screen by Gregory Peck in 1977's ""MacArthur"", becoming a virtual clone to the real guy. Sir Laurence Oliver did Doug once, not too well, in the movie ""Inchon"". OK, we get Tommy Lee Jones, Arkansas accent and all. Costuming did it's part, the uniform and crushed cap, corn-cob pipe, and all that...on a short guy who looked nothing like the real guy...sorta reminded me of General MacArthur as he would have been played by Yosemite Sam! Best casting was of the beautiful actress who played Aya, the lost love of Fox' character. All Japanese actors were perfectly cast as their actual counterparts in history.
  Sets were fine, locations in Japan and rural New Zealand (as parts of rural Japan). Vehicles were spot-on. Even a background Japanese Chi-ha tank. Japanese speak Japanese with English subtitles 90% of the movie. I wish the subtitles would have been used when the Japanese spoke English, as many were so thickly accented it was difficult to understandexcept in context.

Netflix synopsis: ""As World War II ends, Gen MacArthur oversees Japan's surrender, an act that dispels the nation's centuries-old beliefs about its emperor. With the eyes of the world -- and history -- upon them, MacArthur and his protege will change Japan forever.""

Now that synopsis doesn't exactly fit to what the movie was entirely. It's more about Brigadier General Bonner Fellers (played by Matthew Fox). It's his point of view from the start that we witness the struggles he and MacArthur (Tommy Lee Jones) went through. How Fellers painstakingly investigated the role that Emperor Hirohito in war crimes (attack on Pearl Harbor). It was also a bit about Fellers experience when he first visited Japan before the war started. And about the Japanese woman, Aya Shimada (Eriko Hatsune), he fell in love with.

It was really good. My grandpa watched it with me. He wasn't quite sure about watching it. We both enjoyed it. It was a nice piece on adding Fellers' experience in Japan before the war. It gave a better human understanding to who the Japanese people are and their culture. Matthew Fox did a good job I thought. So did Tommy as MacArthur.

5763521,3,B00CZB9BE8,"Fairly accurate discussion of the period surrounding the Japanese surrender, and the events leading into it.  Some felt Hirohito should have been hung, and their arguments are reasonable and valid. Japan never confronted its atrocities during WW2 as did the German people confronted theirs under Hitler, and most young Japanese have no idea of the wretched butchery Japan committed - which has political consequences today as no Japanese leader has truly apologized for what they did in China, for example, leaving the Chinese with constant fury over Japanese behavior against their ancestors (forget for a moment Mao Zedongs' even worse atrocities, as the average Chinese has no idea about that either).  The film has a Japanese giving a lecture to an embarrassed American on world history, as if America was ""Just as bad"" by fully false moral equivalence, as a set up to discuss the atom bombing of Hiroshima and fire-bombing of Tokyo etc., but not a peep about the rapine torture and massacre of 350,000 mostly unarmed Chinese civilians in Nanking by Japanese using Samauri swords and bayonettes, nor the use of Black Plague germ warfare on Chinese regions by Japan as they were withdrawing from, which took another quarter-million lives.  Nor the bombing of Manila and brutal rape-slavery of Philippino and Korean women, men being labor slaves or just killed... etc., etc.  Or the fanatical savagery of Japanese troops on their captured islands, where surrender was forbidden by Shinto warrior codes, and thereby they abused and tortured surrendered British, Americans and Australians without restraint.  Or the Kamakazi attacks, which came too late to end the war in their favor, but made the Americans furious and convinced that any landing of troops to take the Japanese homeland would be a multi-million casualty blood-bath -- which led directly to the decision to use the a-bomb.
Even American youth are not taught these details even as the a-bombs or incindiary raids (which killed far fewer than the two single events in China mentioned above) are emphasized.  The film is typical Hollywood left-wing degenerate, though the acting of the various players, and reasonable accuracy of Hirohito trying to cut a deal to surrender before and after the a-bombs has validity, though even that could be made clearer.  Factually, Hirohito's agents made a secret outreach to America through the Soviet Embassy, but Americans realized he was not directly in control of the Japanese military, and so could not take his gestures as meaningful -- which in any case always demanded his status as God Emperor be preserved.  He was far more involved in the decision-making to start the war, invading China (Manchuria) which was another series of atrocities, as well as continuing the war so long as the outcome favored the ""God-Chosen Superior Being"" Japanese Empire.  As one Japanese MP said (and was shot by an angry associate) ""Hirohito was willing to fight to the very last Japanese person, to save his own sorry life as a God"".
As to MacArthur, the film might have included a sentence or two about his benign dictatorship, where by declaration he re-organized Japanese society to rid it of feudal slavery.  Feudal land-holdings were broken up, with real land distribution to peasant farmers (not like in Communist nations, where such was promised but the Communist Party actually kept all lands and profits for itself).  He ended hereditary prostitution and arranged marriages, gave women freedom and established a parlaiment where everyone had equal vote, plus a legal system of independent jurists.  The Emperor was forced to renounce his ""God"" status and go walk among the people, showing he was an ordinary nose-picker like everyone else.

5763529,5,B00CZB9BE8,"I loved almost everything about this movie:  the historical and cultural context, the dramatic intrigue, the embedded love story, and the musical score.  Indeed the music of the film was an unexpected surprise in that it seemed to sum up many of the themes in the film: conflict, world/war-weariness. love, and loss.

The historical period and context involving the Emperor of Japan in the period immediately following the end of World War II hostilities with Japan is not one I've seen in film or read about before.  However, in many ways it is as crucial to understanding the history which preceded and followed it as the event leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor.  A full treatment of this period would require a mini-series to adequately cover it, but this movie does a decent job of covering a key part of it:  what was the extent of the emperor's involvement in the decision to launch the war against the United States?

A key subplot in the movie is a love story between one of the generals serving General MacArthur and a Japanese woman in years prior to the war.  It is told through flashbacks spread throughout the movie, but it is effective in capturing one of the key themes of the movie, that of a conflicted relationship between two countries.  Some have found the love story to be a distraction, but I found it instead to be integral to the whole movie.  Though told in a shorter manner than it could have been, the love story helps to convey the sense of what was lost in the war:  a beautiful country and people that were swept into the chaos of events larger than them, resulting in great destruction to themselves and others.  There are other ways that this could have been told, but the romantic relationship between these two characters quickly grounds the viewers in the period and brings a sense of reality to events and their consequences.

I would have enjoyed seeing either the love story or the historical events told in a longer story format like a mini-series, but that would have changed some of the themes of the film.  Taken as-is, it is a fine movie that quickly transports one back in time to a key period in history and leaves us wondering a bit what the world might have been like if these two countries and cultures had been able to find another way through the conflict of their time.  The film's beautiful musical score left me reflecting on this and feeling like something wonderful had been lost.",1384646400,,2442,4.607390300230947

Anyone who has studied this time period, post WWII Japan, especially as a gaijin, will attest to our lack of evidence to make a convincing argument concerning Hirohito's true role in all that happened in Japan. (cf: Herbert Bix's ""Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan"") That part of this film that seems well done, is no doubt due to the Japanese input into it.  I have spent some years in Japan and studied its history as a non-academic.  So, like many of the other reviewers have stated, the ultimate judgement of the movie is that it could have been so much more.  Another Hollywood failed opportunity in my opinion.  The fabricated love element with General Fellers is a tough one, as it adds some balance to understanding of the national Japanese character, but again as others have said it too often interrupts what should be the crux of this movie, and perhaps the love story should have been another movie entirely separate from this one.  So, I have very mixed feelings overall.  But what it could have been is a masterpiece:  a movie of deeply spiritual epiphanies for those who have never been to Japan and an insight into the good choices made in the complexity of the rebuilding of a wounded nation.  Despite all the years of rocky relationship between it and the U.S since the arrival of our ""Black Ships"" in the mid 1800's, and I am biased no doubt, this movie grants us a tiny peek into the nobility of errors and beauties that comprise a country I love so much.

5763536,2,B00CZB9BE8,"This movie takes place after the surrender of Japan and General MacArthur is tasked with trying to rebuild Japan and also dealing with war criminals.  Should he also prosecute the Emperor Hirohito and if he does what will be the aftermath?  Of course the citizens of the United States would love to see him convicted and hung, but Japanese citizens will have even more chaos then the incinerated cities that are left.  Besides that, the Communists will come in and take over.  A young Brigadier General by the name of Bonner Fellers is charged with finding all the war criminals and also investigating the role of the Emperor in the bombing of Pearl Harbor and whether he was actually in control.

The other part of this story deals with Bonner Feller's relationship with a young Japanese woman who he met at college.  Actually he attended the college in 1916, before he went to the US Military Academy at West Point, so the dates seem a little bit off.  There are these continuous flashbacks to their days together in America and then in Japan before the war.  It's during this phase that Feller's tries to absorb as much as he can about Japanese culture and writes a paper on the psychological mind of a Japanese soldier.

To me this whole movie dealt more with this relationship than it did with trying to reconcile what was needed to do to bring justice to war criminals, put some kind of order into a devastated country, and determine if the Emperor should still stay in power.

I was expecting more of an emphasis and presence of Douglas MacArthur then General Fellers.  That didn't seem to happen.  Tommy Lee Jones, as much as he is able to portray a lot of different characters, really didn't hit the mark as the famous, corncob pipe smoking hero.  The whole film was clearly romanticized which is unfortunate because we all know too well the suffering and shear destruction that was suffered by not just the nation of Japan, but most of the world at that time.",1384214400,2,1969,4.623563218390805

This film is the first characterization of the role the Emperor played, and the sacrifices he made, to bring about the re-vitalization of Japan, as it is for the role played by General McArthur.  For the first time in the history of the world, a conquering nation helped to rebuild a defeated nation, as was also done for Germany, but this amazing movement toward a more civilized world has been ignored in the teaching of history to students and little understood by the general public.

5763545,3,B00CZB9BE8,"When I saw the subject matter I was very excited to see Emperor. I love historical dramas, to be able to get an idea of what it must have been like to live through important times/events in history. That being said I found this movie to be a bit of a let down. While the movie is based on actual events it takes far too much creative license with the story. One the biggest being Fellers had NO hand in picking out targets to bomb on mainland Japan (that would have been under the control of General Hap Arnold not MacArthur), he spent the war as a military attach and psychological warfare planner and was Chief of Psychological Operations under MacArthur.

The fictional love story between Bonner Fellers and Aya Shimada (who is loosely based on Yuri Watanabe, who was a friend he met in college in 1914) completely bogs down the movie. Instead of the fictional Fellers wandering Japan romantically chasing Aya right before the war as the movie portrays, what the movie doesn't tell us is that Fellers was actually married (in 1925 and not to Yuri) and was a father. Also when he did visit Japan in the pre-war years his wife usually accompanied him. Had the focus been solely on his investigations, dealings with Japanese political leaders and generals rather than wasting time with the fictional love angle the movie would have been much more interesting. Also, Fellers sneaking out at night, eating/drinking in the bombed out neighborhoods and finally getting beaten up by some local Japanese thugs was simply ridiculous. I found the best parts of the movie to be his dealings with Tojo and near the end when MacArthur and The Emperor finally meet.

Acting is not bad, it is interesting to see MacArthur with his gigantic publicity hound ego, it's just too bad the story was so disappointing. And the ending notes bothered me, when it said Fellers was demoted by Eisenhower after the war. As usually happens when a war ends many of the Senior Officers are lowered in rank and he was just one of 212 Generals that were reduced in rank. To make is sound like he was singled out by Eisenhower and demoted is utter rubbish. It is true Eisenhower did not like Fellers but that was not why he was reduced in rank.",1382659200,6,2212,4.597468354430379

Something about the way the movie looked made it feel like it was shot on some less than optimal camera equipment.

Where the movie fails is in the details. A simple search on Wikipedia reveals that there was no love story as portrayed in the movie. For some reason Hollywood can't seem to take a compelling bit of reality and turn it into a movie without adding storylines which have no relation to the truth.  The Colonel certainly did not have the ability to redirect B-29s away from Shizuoka prefecture to avoid killing his(non-existent) former Japanese girlfriend. (In fact, even today there isn't much in Shizuoka which would be worth targeting by bombers, let alone in WW II, unless we wanted to strike the site of a future amusement park or ice rink.) His former girlfriend's uncle is portrayed is an Army General. In a late scene in the movie he talks about having  fought on Iwo Jima and committing terrible atrocities. Fact: something like 1% of the Japanese soldiers on Iwo Jima for the battle survived the battle and if any of them were officers they weren't Generals- they were either killed or committed Seppuku(ritual suicide). In all my travels around Japan alone or with my wife and her family I have never read an account of a Japanese officer - either in Japanese or translated into English- where he apologized for atrocities the army committed. The emperor is portrayed as sort of a sheltered nave powerless figurehead victimized by a military regime who used his name to justify war. This is a popular belief but is a fictional fabrication of the Imperial Household Agency and the  GHQ after the war to prevent the execution of the emperor (which GHQ- wrongly!- believed  would turn the Japanese public against the occupying forces).  Of course the Imperial Household Agency wanted to protect the emperor. The reality is somewhere between the innocent powerless victim  and war mongering fanatic he was believed to be during the war. He certainly was aware of the details of the China campaigns and evidence strongly suggests he supported them. (Frankly, what King, Emperor  etc of the time *didn't* want conquest in his name?. During the Battle of Guadalcanal he was angry that his forces couldn't sacrifice more and prevail. Hardly a disinterested victim of the war. It is true however that he was much more interested in marine biology than warfare and was probably not a war monger like Hitler or Mussolini. There are a number of books on the subject of the true nature of Hirohito's culpability for the Pacific War- I think there is one called ""Hirohito and the making of Modern Japan"" by Herbert Bix, for example. Lastly, would the Japanese have revolted if we tried and executed Hirohito? Here's what Japanese acquaintances who were born before the war have told me: No! They said there might have been a  little unrest had we openly arrested and tried and executed him, but had we simply removed and executed him quietly almost no one would have cared. The Japanese did not really believe he was a god. My father-in-law, who was in school during the war told me that they were told he was god but no one believed it.",1381363200,,3308,4.799648506151143

MacArthur ruled not like a Ceaser but as an American style benevolent despot. His staff must have lived in Japan before the war, understood not just the language but the culture, even shintoism for God sake. I regard shinto as one step removed from Voo-Doo. I've always postulated that if you understand a ethnic cultures child games or games period you will understand intuitively how they think, bargain, make war, negotiate, see what it is they value. For instance in America we play poker the Soviets used to play Chess we bluffed them and won the cold war. But too many of us were bad monopoly players. The lesson of this movie is that when dealing with another culture whether waging war or negotiating the peace you better know the culture. The pentagon now rightly refers to this as ""cultural intelligence,"" those who dismiss it or treat it lightly are stupid and don't deserve to ever rise to flag rank. True muslims don't play drinking games in college or even gamble. I wish I knew what games they play? Doing so would help us negotiate the peace in Afghanistan and with the Mullahs in Iran.

5763573,4,B00CZB9BE8,"History buffs should have a very good time with ""Emperor,"" an unusually interesting look at Japanese/American relations in the aftermath of World War II.

Matthew Fox, of ""Lost"" fame, plays Brigadier General Bonner Fellers, the man whom General MacArthur (Tommy Lee Jones) has personally put in charge of determining whether or not the disgraced Emperor Hirohito should be tried as a war criminal (i.e., did he order or sign off on the attack on Pearl Harbor?). It falls to Fellers to perform the laborious task of piecing together the evidence both for and against the leader, interviewing those who were closest to him (those who haven't already died or committed suicide, that is) as a means of arriving at the verdict.

Directed by Peter Webber, ""Emperor"" could easily have become a dry and tedious exercise in historical re-creation were it not for the fact that the script by Vera Blasi and David Klass continually raises a host of thorny ethical issues along the way. Are the Allies being hypocritical for condemning Japan for its imperialistic ambitions when the Brits and Americans essentially led the way in such behavior? Will hanging the Emperor cause a revolt among the masses of loyal Japanese citizens whom the Americans are trying to win over to their side? Or does justice demand that Hirohito pay for his crimes at the end of a rope, or would such an outcome merely be giving into a need for revenge on the part of the American people, an act, by the way, that wouldn't exactly hurt MacArthur's political ambitions back home (we are told he dearly wants to become President)?

Throughout the course of his investigation, Fellers is forced to find a way to deal with a culture and a people that, while they may appear modern on the surface, have their roots planted firmly in the ancient values of loyalty and shame.

Even Feller's rather cliched romance with a Japanese woman before the war nicely contributes to the themes the movie is exploring.",1380240000,,1965,4.839285714285714

There is, of course, a lot more to this story than can be presented in a movie.  Much must be realized by what is not said or what is just alluded to.  Perhaps best considered here is why the then Character of the Japanese People, embodied by their Emperor, well read by MacArthur, is a primary reason why the peace engineered by General Douglas MacArthur has worked.

On the other side of the coin, films which take excessive poetic license in depicting historical events tend to create an annoying mishmash of fact and fiction that is distracting to the viewer.

Emperor avoids both of those pitfalls. It presents, in a general way, the actual narrative of events which followed the Japanese surrender at the end of World War II. While doing so, it manages to create a certain dramatic tension in its audience, notwithstanding the fact that the audience already knows the ultimate outcome.

In addition, the film avoids the temptation to portray the central character, Douglas MacArthur, as some sort of a clich or caricature (Although Tommy Lee Jones does not physically resemble the late five-star general, his performance captures the essence of a senior officer facing a momentous command decision under extreme political pressure). Finally, it weaves a fictional love story into the narrative without distracting from the main theme.",1379635200,3,1364,5.223744292237443
5763588,5,B00CZB9BE8,"During the initial occupation of Japan, Douglas MacArthur (Tommy Lee Jones)is assigned the task of determining if the Emperor of Japan is guilty of war crimes and should hang. He assigns the investigation to General Bonner Fellers (Matthew Fox). In addition to gathering evidence, Fellers also searches for a lost love, a Japanese woman (Eriko Hatsune) he met back in 1932.

The film uses flashbacks to also give us an historical background. Tommy Lee Jones gives us a saucy speaking likeable MacArthur and not the disliked ""Dugout Doug."" It was an interesting look into the decision making of the era, for many people, even now, question the decision to save the Emperor. The film is enjoyable as a slow moving historical drama. It includes about a two minute Chomsky style lecture/view on world history. A film to appeal to the intellectual in us, not those who crave action.

The part of the plot that dealt with this was interesting and could have been developed more thoroughly.  The Asian actors were great, Tommy Lee Jones was better than adequate and the lead actor was okay (and his performance was brought down by the romance which just didn't seem credible).

It's one of those subjects which probably can't be done via one film;  perhaps a HBO miniseries but not one film.

5763609,4,B00CZB9BE8,"If your know your history, the most important catalyst in the peacemaking process between Japan and the U. S. was General Douglas MacArthur. This was his finest hour. This film - a joint Japanese/American production - is about the beginning of MacArthur's reign as Supreme Commander; and how he, with the assistance of his staff, sorts out the status of Emperor Hirohito. The title of the movie, I assume is in reference to Hirohito; but it could just as easily apply to MacArthur's benevolent dictatorship. While Tommy Lee Jones gets lead billing as MacArthur - and he performs brilliantly, Texas accent and all - the real star of the film is Matthew Fox, as MacArthur's staff assistant, Brigadier Gen Bonner Fellers. It was Fellers who led the investigation into the Emperor's role in the War; and he put together the position papers that MacArthur used to exonerate Hirohito...at least sufficiently to allow him to remain as emperor. Fellers' knowledge of Japan and its people was instrumental in his investigation and in his findings. And Fellers did have a pre-war romance with a Japanese girl; but the romance with Aya (played beautifully by Eriko Hatsune) is fictionalized in the film...for dramatic effect I'm sure. The movie received only a limited release in this country, for reasons I have been unable to discover...it deserved much better.

5763610,5,B00CZB9BE8,"This is a fascinating, slow-paced--by today's standards--production, with just a single, truly compelling on-screen scene of violence, a fist fight in a bar. The Japan of 1945 is convincingly depicted in exquisite detail. One scene movingly reveals what most Americans are unaware of, the Japanese point of view during the war and before it. Over the last sixty years, American propaganda has kept this information well concealed, mirroring the propaganda and concealment of the Empire of Japan.

The production design is exquisitely rendered, and the performances are first-class. A fine commentary accompanies the Blu-ray disc. In just one on-screen pose, Jones actually looks like Douglas Macarthur. But no one could have played the arrogant prima donna better. Macarthur became, in effect, the post-war emperor of Japan, a fact the title alludes to.

The appearance of female lead Eriko Hatsune, who learned English to land the role, is reason enough to buy the product. She is enchantingly lovely and convincing as a Japanese woman of the period.",1378598400,,1051,5.325301204819277

The message this movie conveys is not limited to the war in the Pacific almost 70 years ago, the crucial importance trying to understand different cultures could be applied to all wars following WWII.
I personally was impressed with the performance of all actors. I'm not familiar with any other work of Matthew Fox but thought he did an excellent job portraying General Fellers as a man of integrity, depth and humanity. The movie managed to be emotionally compelling and avoided successfully to be overly sentimental. Emperor is an intelligent movie.

5763614,2,B00CZB9BE8,"This movie reminds me of ""Pearl Harbor"" in that the film attempts to conflate an epic time in American history with romantic drama.  I suspect that lure has plenty of rationale behind it and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.  Here's an example of how it doesn't.  Based on a book by Hiro Okamoto and written by Vera Blasi and David Klass, director Peter Webber teases the audience with some of the inner workings of General Douglas McArthur (Tommy Lee Jones) who was assigned by President Truman to ""rebuild"" Japan after a couple A-bombs destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

One of the key elements in McArthur's plan is yet to be decided.  Specifically, what to do with Emperor Hirohito (Takataro Kataoka).  He was considered a god by the Japanese and there was concern of making him a martyr if he was tried and convicted of war crimes.  Still, what was his role in the attack on America?  McArthur assigned the task of investigating Hirohito's role to Brig. General Bonner Fellers (Matthew Fox) who had lived briefly in Japan and had a romantic relationship with Aya who he met in college when she was studying in America.

About the time the viewer becomes interested in the crime procedural, Fellers drifts off to dreamland and we get a flashback of some point in his relationship with Aya.  He is also determined to find her in Japan or at least what happened to her.  If this sound interesting, it isn't.  We do get to see another side of the ambitious McArthur who is portrayed as a hard-liner and had eyes on the White House.  Certainly true by most accounts, but here he is also an expert manipulator of process.  He is aware that the future of Japan and certainly its relationship with America would be best served by allowing the Emperor to remain a figurehead which he most likely was anyway.  Not wanting to appear soft however, Feller's empathy for the Japanese and likely recommendation would make his position more palatable.

In the end the movie just stalls when Fellers memories kick in or when he is out searching for Aya.  Fox doesn't help things much with his wooden performance.  Jones certainly invigorates the film when he's on screen.  Unfortunately it isn't often enough.

The Blu ray transfer comes in 1080p with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1.  The look is very good.  With the current time frame the film is purposefully muted, some of which is that the locations are literally bombed out.  The country has been destroyed.  In the flashbacks, the colors are more vibrant.  In all cases the detail is excellent.  Likewise the audio is excellent.  Using a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track, there is good use of the subs as well as some nifty surround use (McArthur's airplane landing).  Otherwise the dialog is clear and consistent throughout.  Extras include a voice over commentary by the director and producer, some deleted scenes,a ""making of"" featurette, a gallery of photos of the real people in the story and a trailer.",1378512000,,2956,4.7637795275590555

Why these Hollywood screenwriters insist on injecting a cheesy love story into movies like this is beyond me.

There was entirely too much time spent on the personal relationship between the Gen. Fellers and the Aya.  Also the flashbacks made for a very confusing presentation.  It took a moment or two sometime to figure out where you were.
However, the point was made and made clearly as to the Emperor's role in the war.  Most important his position in the country before the war and during the war as well as the great personal risk he took in 1) making the broadcast of surrender and 2) meeting with Gen. MacArthur.  It also made a very clear point that whatever his faults, MacArthur was intelligent enough to realize how important it was to get Japan on its feet again.
There were a look of seriously missed opportunities in this film. Still it was good. The General was well played by Tommy Lee Jones.  He is an excellent actor and he was very good here.  I just wish they had spent more time on the important aspects of the plot and less on the love story.

The film simutaneously deals with personal issues of McArthur's attache', General Bonner Fellers. Whether these depictions were actually true, it was especially poignant at the moment near the end of the film when the character, Fellers, realizes by his orders that his long lost love was probably killed.

5763649,4,B00CZB9BE8,"After the Japanese surrender in August, 1945, General Douglas MacArthur was given the job of overseeing the American occupation.  MacArthur became the de facto ruler of Japan.  In this movie, this tumultuous time in American history is revisited.

Tommy Lee Jones stars as General MacArthur.  He has chosen his expert on Japanese culture, General Bonner Fellers (Matthew Fox) to provide evidence within ten days if Emperor Hirohito should be convicted of war crimes or saved.  Thus begins a Herculean task for Fellers, who previously had fallen in love with a Japanese exchange student named Aya (Eriko Hatsune).

Fellers interviews numerous Japanese personalities, including Tojo and Kito, while remembering his love with Aya.  During this time, Fellers' view changes from wanting Hirohito prosecuted to realizing that Hirohito could be valuable in assisting with the rebuilding of Japan.

I found ""Emperor"" to be an informative and entertaining movie.  As always, Tommy Lee Jones gives a top-notch performance as General Douglas MacArthur.  Matthew Fox is equally as good as General Fellers.  The movie does a good job of showing the American occupation of Japan and how many Japanese resented their conquerors.

I recommend this movie to anyone interested in World War II history.  It does a fine job of showing how two former enemies could work together for a greater outcome.",1377388800,,1380,5.275229357798165

The U.S. devastation of Japanese cities is clearly portrayed in brief archival footage of the dropping of the atomic bomb and more vividly in drives and walks through the post-apocalyptic ruins of Tokyo, but mention of the horrors perpetrated by the Japanese military is perfunctory, at best.  Watching Matthew Fox's pallid portrayal of Gen. Bonner Fellers (an undemanding role that nonetheless exceeds his acting abilities) one would imagine Fellers a magnanimous victor, indeed, a liberal in his desire to see a rebuilt Japan.  All of that may have been part of his makeup, but, from the script, one would imagine him later as a member of Amnesty International rather than, as was the case, the virulent anti-Communist John Birch Society.  The most telling scene of moral compromise ended up on the cuttring-room floor, leaving a character too squeaky clean for belief.  The rough edges of American politics and security concerns in the 1940s are all mentioned but severely downplayed in order to make this figure more palatable and sympathetic to a later generation, but all this really accomplishes is turning him into something banal.",1377302400,,1265,5.181372549019608

The way that many Japanese reacted to the American occupation is also something we don't hear much about, but it makes perfect sense. This film does, however, need something more and/or something else. Though it takes up about half the story-time here, all the stuff about General Fellers's tragic would-be romance with Japanese teacher Aya Shimada has only a very loose tie-in with the whole premise of the film.

5763656,4,B00CZB9BE8,"The period of history that the movie plays through represents a huge scope and the story, although close to what happened, justifiably needs to take some poetic license in order to not trivialize the difficulty of the times. General MacArthur is playfully portrayed by Tommy Lee Jones, one of the best actors in today's cinema in my opinion. Jones helps to provide moments of gravitas that help the story move along especially when he is dealing directly with the Emperor. On second thought, the story never defines which of the two personalities in the movie are the Emperor of the movie, MacArthur or the Japanese God-King . There is no doubt in hindsight that the real General MacArthur made the correct decision in how he dealt with the Japanese God-King for the sake of the future that we live in today. For that many kudos obtain! In the movie, Jones puts much of that gravitas on display, albeit he has very little screen time. Meanwhile the story wends its way around the investigation of the Emperor's role in starting and ending the war. The angst portrayed by the investigating Brigadier General and the muted love story are obviously  too far from reality but they do provide a texture to the backdrop of the seriousness involved in the decision to keep the Emperor on the throne instead of attempting to try him for the war crimes that his military were responsible for across Asia and the Pacific.

5763659,3,B00CZB9BE8,"IT'S LIKE WATCHING history through a romance writer's lens - or history-light, the way some might like to imagine it to be. This film about gathering proof of Emperor Hirohito's support or opposition to Japan's role in World War II is more wishful thinking than history.

Tommy Lee Jones plays General Douglas MacArthur, his opening scene complete with sunglasses and corncob pipe. Those in Hampton Roads are familiar with the General. The MacArthur Memorial holds memorabilia of his role in the Pacific Theater, along with the many men and women who served with him. Located in Norfolk, VA, the museum is filled with Japan's tribute to the man who championed the country's restoration after the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

If you're a history buff, best save your money for a trip to Norfolk.

Director Peter Webber (""Girl with a Pearl Earring,"" ""Hannibal Rising"") presents `Emperor' as an uphill battle against those who want to see Japan decimated for the bombing at Pearl Harbor and its role in WWII, and those pulling for restoration. A good question after the brutal devastation of not one but two atom bombs.

It should make a good movie sometime.

The role of MacArthur's lead investigator, Gen. Bonner Fellers, goes to Matthew Fox of ""Lost."" Fox and Jones have good chemistry together. (I'd like to see this team in action again.) Still, much is made of Fellers' possible romance with a young Japanese woman; his budding relationship with her before the war, and his search for her afterwards as he looks for information to exonerate or condemn Hirohito.

The small budget movie was filmed in New Zealand and looks fantastic. Locations certainly bring to mind the historic look of the United States and a post-war Japan. As pointed out in a technically-minded commentary with Webber and producer Yuko Narahashi, very little greenscreen was used. But it must be said that the best effect is Tommy Lee Jones; his face is a sunbaked landscape that commands the high-def picture whenever he appears.

Extras also include a handful of deleted scenes, adding a touch more character development. A featurette, ""Revenge or Justice: The Making of `Emperor'"" doesn't tell us any more than the film and commentary, although it has a short interview with Fox. Photos in the behind-the-scenes gallery are unremarkable; ""The Historic Photo Gallery"" has only two pictures.

The commentary offers an occasional tidbit - such as the actor who plays Hirohito is a Kabuki actor, who plays female roles. He studied the Emperor's body language in newsreel footage, making him a strong onscreen match for Tommy Lee's General.

Another tidbit is that, tasked with coming up with a Southern curse, Webber asked Jones if he had any recommendations. The actor provided a list the next day; they chose one - you'll recognize it when you hear it.

And we also learn that Fellers' romance is more conjecture than truth. No surprise there.

But give Webber credit for the worst statement I've ever heard in a commentary. Noting the historic afterwards photos at the end of the film, highlighting the demotion of both MacArthur and Fellers, Webber dismisses them as something ""audiences seem to like."" And it's up to viewers to find out why; it's not his place to give history lessons.

Just something to keep in mind if you decide to watch this flick.

5763663,3,B00CZB9BE8,"Tommy Lee Jones is General Douglas MacArthur in ""Emperor"" directed by Peter Webber (""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" ""Hannibal Rising""), and the seasoned Oscar winner does an excellent job as usual. Unfortunately, Tommy Lee Jones is only second-billed and his screen time is pretty limited, as the ""Emperor"" mainly follows the story of a U.S. Army officer Bonner Frank Fellers (Matthew Fox), who is ordered by MacArthur to investigate whether or not Emperor Hirohito should be tried as a war criminal. And he has to do it in ten days.

So part of the film unfolds like a political thriller, where Fellers meets several key persons before and during the war like Hideki Tojo (Shohei Hino) and Fumimaro Konoe (Masatoshi Nakamura). This story, set in post-war Tokyo, is interspersed with flashback to his pre-war romance with a Japanese woman Aya Shimada (Eriko Hatsune). Fellers, who once wrote an article about Japanese soldiers with a help from Aya and General Kajima (Toshiyuki Nishida), attempts to locate the missing Aya, with an interpreter Takahashi (Masayoshi Haneda).

Bonner Frank Fellers is not a fictional character. In fact, most characters are real-life persons, including Teizaburo Sekiya (Isao Natsuyagi), who is the grandfather of one of the movie's producers Yoko Narahashi. The film's premise provides a great opportunity for absorbing historical drama, but director and writers Vera Blasi and David Klass fail to make a full use of it. Actors all did a great job, but none of them is given enough time to impress us as fleshed-out characters.

According to the film, MacArthur and Fellers played an important role in this decisive moment in modern Japanese history, but the film spends so much time following the fictional love story, which has nothing to do with their decision making. Some interesting episodes (like Kyujo Incident) are treated cursorily. ""Emperor"" knows what it wants to do. Sadly it does not seem to know how.",1377043200,,1943,5.10377358490566

The occupying U.S. Army under the aegis of General Douglas MacArthur(Tommy Lee Jones) are crafting a rebuilding of their conquered former enemies but there are a few pieces of business to take care of most notably the fate of Emperor Hirohito.  The people in the States want the Emperor hanged but MacArthur knows that he is regarded as a God in some quarters by his constituency.  Executing him may cause an uprising and MacArthur has to find compelling evidence to avoid putting Hirohito on trial.  He assigns the case to General Bonner Fellers(Matthew Fox) to gather evidence to either try or not try Hirohito and is given a scant ten days.  The beauty of ""Emperor"" is it works not so much as a conventional war film but a legal drama where the Army acts as attorneys for the most unlikely of defendants.  The film is intricately crafted and though we know the outcome it is interesting to see how history takes shape.  There are a few dry patches in the film but that might be because the makers are attempting to demonstrate the arduous nature of an investigation.  Some people find fault with a love story between Fellers and a Japanese girl shown in flashback prior to the war.  I didn't think these segments interfered with the narrative but added texture to the job that Fellers had at hand and what his emotions are about carrying it out.

MacArthur always had a heart full of emotion, along with the steel of a Patton.  He was the perfect person to help Japan rebuild after a terrible war.  It was so easy to hate after the things they did, but he and others saw past their warrior culture and other things, that really started their militarists on this path to Pearl Harbor.  The country was in ruin.  Their people were in ruin.  Without men like MacArthur and Roosevelt , the culture of this beautiful country would have been lost to the ages.  The key to all of it, seemed to be linked to saving the Emperor.  It was hard to not have tears in your eyes at the last scenes of the movie.  I have watched a lot of WWII movies.

It faced squarely an issue we tend to forget was foremost on the minds of lots of Americans in August 1945: ""We won. Hang the Emperor. He must have approved - if not planned - Pearl Harbor.""
MacArthur is shown to be the egotistical blowhard any conservative man is expected to have to be shown as being in Hollywood. Nevertheless, he is shown to be a man who understands the big picture and knows how to get things done. As far as MacArthur living in a fancy house while Japan was in ruins, in REALITY he stayed in the American Ambassador's residence (as it was before the war). But Fellers character is played very convincingly by Mathew Fox and Tommy Lee Jones makes it delightful; [SPOILER] Jones tells Fellers concerning interviewing an unwilling assistant to the Emperor: ""I don't care what you have to do; make a miracle; but don't come back into this office without dragging this guy in here by his balls."" Jones really pulls it off.
And BEST OF ALL, I didn't have to wince at the spectacle of seeing Fox and his love interest - also played great by Eriko Hatsune - in a sex scene, which would have ruined the movie.

After you see the humane consideration the USA showed towards this former enemy, and after the re-building of similarly devastated Germany without asking for reparations of ANY sort, I wonder how and why our so-called President calls us ""Imperialistic?""

I didn't know what to expect before renting this but after having just watched this on DVD, I was surprised at just how good this movie was.  I am actually even more shocked by some of the bad reviews given here.  I can understand that some may be disappointed in the fact that the movie is less of an accurate docu-drama than they expected.  And granted this movie appears to get some of the historical stuff wrong and also throws a romance into the historical part of the movie as well. But unlike some movies, which portray themselves as based on a true story, this movie at least didn't make that claim but at the very least gives the real players credit at the end of the movie.

An action movie this is not, nor is it a true story documentary either.  But this movie has a good story loosely based on the dilemma of whether or not to prosecute the Japanese emperor after WWII with a believable although somewhat fictional romance thrown in.  Although this romance may not be Fellers story, it could have been some soldiers story whether it be American or Japanese who lost their loved ones in war.  So I am less critical with those aspects as those reviewers who were expecting more of a factual portrayal.

I was less impressed with Tommy Lee Jones as MacArthur though as I have seen better portrayals than his bombastic flamboyant portrayal that Jones displayed.  Fox was ok but seemed a bit strained in his emotional portrayal.  I actually thought the Japanese cast did great portrayals of the historical figures in the movie.

5763689,2,B00CZB9BE8,"The heroes and villains are not easily delineated in ""Emperor"", an uneven hybrid of History Channel docudrama and Lifetime weepie based on Shiro Okamoto's book and directed by Peter Weber. Set in post-WW 2 Japan at the dawn of the American occupation, the story centers on the roundup of key Japanese military and political leaders to be tried for war crimes. President Truman has appointed General Douglas MacArthur (a scenery-chewing Tommy Lee Jones) to oversee the operation; he in turn delegates ""Japan expert"" Brigadier General Bonner Fellers (tepid leading man Matthew Fox) to see that the task is executed pronto. Fellers is also directed to investigate whether the biggest fish, Emperor Hirohito (Takataro Kataoka) gave direct input on war strategy. MacArthur has allotted him only a week or so to conduct his investigation (no pressure!).

Indeed, the question of the Emperor's guilt is a complex one (and the most historically fascinating element of the film). Was he merely a figurehead, kept carefully squirreled away in his hermetic bubble throughout the war and occasionally trotted out for propagandistic purposes? Or did he have a direct say in day-to-day military decisions, perhaps even giving a direct blessing for the attack on Pearl Harbor? And there is the cultural element to consider. MacArthur (at least as depicted in the film) was shrewd enough to realize that if he could build a working relationship with Hirohito, perhaps the Emperor could in turn persuade the populace to cooperate with their overseers, thereby expediting the rebuild of Japan's socio-political infrastructure. Even if he was a paper tiger, the Emperor's words traditionally held substantial sway over the Japanese people.

Unfortunately, screenwriters Vera Blasi and David Klass shoot themselves in the foot and sidestep this potentially provocative historical reassessment by injecting an unconvincing romantic subplot involving Fellers' surreptitious search to discover the fate of a Japanese exchange student (Aya Shimada) who he dated in college (the young woman, whose father was a general in the Imperial Army, returned to Japan before the war). The flashback scenes recapping the relationship are curiously devoid of passion and dramatically flat, grinding the film to a halt with each intrusion. While Fox has a touch of stoic Henry Fonda/Gary Cooper vibe going for him, his performance feels wooden, especially when up against Jones, who makes the most of his brief screen time (even he is given short shrift, mostly relegated to caricature and movie trailer-friendly lines like ""Let's show them some good old-fashioned American swagger!""). I sense that at some point during the film's development there was an interesting James Clavell-style culture-clash drama in here somewhere. But when the denouement is a re-enactment of an historic photo that slowly dissolves from the actors into the actual photo? That is rarely a good sign...",1376352000,5,2943,5.38177874186551
5763690,1,B00CZB9BE8,"Emperor was a major letdown for me. I love historical dramas, but this was nothing more than a second-rate romance, the likes of which you would find on the Hallmark Channel. Matthew Fox is dreadfully bad as General Fellers. He seems completely out of his depth on the big screen. It was like watching petrified wood in an army uniform. The dialogue is flat, particularly Fox's nasally, insipid narration. The production values are second rate. The chemistry between the love interests is nonexistent. With the possible exception of Tommy Lee Jones, the entire cast is uninspired and subpar. But even Jones seemed to be phoning it in.

This had the potential to be a very compelling film about some of the most significant historical events of the 20th Century. Opportunity blown.",1376179200,18,780,4.9541984732824424

The plot is terrible (I would be very surprised if it is historically accurate). The dialogue is inane. The soundtrack is cheap. And most of all Matthew Fox is so awful it's almost embarrassing to watch. The only thing decent about this movie is Tommy Lee Jones, who IMO makes a pretty good MacArthur.

5763692,1,B00CZB9BE8,"Forget the poster or the title, this movies only makes passing references to MacArthur or Emperor Hirohito. It instead centers on a contrived, predictable romance between a character based on a real general and a woman who never existed. That might be forgivable if the story were interesting, but it isn't.",1376006400,16,307,5.03921568627451
5763693,3,B00CZB9BE8,"Let me start off by saying I believe that Emperor Hirohito was a war criminal. I think that was even clear in 1945, much more so today. Having said that should he be tried for his crimes? I remember reading a leader in an ex-communist country saying that it was more important to have democracy then put people in court.

In this movie, General MacArthur is given 10 days to decide whether or not to bring to trial Emperor Hirohito. So he gives the job to General Fellers to make a recommendation.

We are then given two stories one of an ex-love affair that Fellers had with a Japanese girl and his investigations. To me, they did not really go well together. Although I was wondering whether General McArthur might have known about Fellers activities during ww2 about the Japanese girl and selected him because he had something then over Fellers. Maybe but as it is I thought the Japanese girl was a distraction in the story.

One nic pick, is I doubt a Japanese general at Saipan and Okinawa would have survived these battles.

So of my concerns are much more for example Emperor Hirohito did not go the first time to General MacArthur's home but to his headquarters. Why did the movie make such a big deal about that when it did not happen?

This film does not discuss whether any options like Emperor Hirohito abdicates but his family remains in power were discussed. Nor does this film point out that not only was Hirohito spared but also anyone in the royal family, like Prince Yasuhiko Asaka who had much to answer for in Nanking Massacre. We are not given any discussion of this in the movie.

What we are treated too is I thought a rather silly discussion of General MacArthur's presidential ambitions.

Other then that everything is okay, the acting although no-one impressed me. The filming is good.

Worth a look.",1375920000,4,1826,4.596923076923077

Could he look LESS like ol'Doug, or at least, lose the Texas twang?
What should have been a rather compelling story seemed bland and plodding, at least in my eyes. Was Feller's pre-war romance with a Japanese woman historically accurate, or just added for effect?
I nitpick, but Feller's girlfriend's uncle is described as a Japanese general, but he is shown wearing an admiral's uniform.
This a film that perhaps tries hard, but comes up short, IMHO. Still,worth viewing, especially by anyone interested in this critical period of Japanese history.",1375747200,3,786,4.917293233082707

5763696,4,B00CZB9BE8,"Shiro Okamoto's book `His Majesty's Salvation' has been adapted for the screen by Vera Blasi and David Klass and renamed EMPEROR. Director Peter Webber (Hannibal Rising, Girl with a Pearl Earring) keeps what might have been a patchwork quilt story tightly woven and if the movie delivers nothing else, it gives insight into the relationship between Japan and the US after the devastation of the atomic bomb and the resultant surrender of Japan. For that alone the film is well worth watching.

The setting of the film is 1945 when General MacArthur (Tommy Lee Jones) steps onto the shores of Japan as the Supreme Commander of the occupying forces. Assigned to rebuild Japan after the war MacArthur selects General Bonner Fellers (Matthew Fox), a man with a history with Japan before the war, including a love affair with a Japanese student Aya Shimada (Eriko Hatsune) in America before the war: Aya returned to Japan when relations with between Japan and the US began to dissolve and Fellers followed her for a futile attempt to overcome differences between cultures and impending historic changes, to investigate whether Emperor Hirohito (Takatar Kataoka) should be tried and hanged as a war criminal. Memories of Aya and his quest to find her in the ravaged post-war landscape help Fellers to discover both his wisdom and his humanity and enable him to come to the momentous decision that changed the course of history and the future of two nations. He meets with the advisors to the Emperor, is rebuked by the Japanese citizenry, and is frustrated with the information he is basically unable to gather until he finally arranges through the aid of his translator chauffeur a meeting between the Emperor and MacArthur in which the Emperor's perception of human dignity is presented and MacArthur has found his answer Feller's sought.

Throughout the film we are reminded about the basic cultural differences between not only East and West, but particularly the culture of Japan - a culture deeply dependent on devotion to Emperor and country. It is an enlightening journey for us as audience, one of understanding and respect, and one that should be more widely shared. Matthew Fox does well with his bifurcated role and he is strongly supported by a very fine cast of Japanese actors.  This is a film from which we all can learn important issues while being entertained with a fine period piece. Grady Harp, August 13",1375488000,32,2419,4.95320197044335

Tommy Lee Jones as General Douglas MacArthur and Matthew Fox as General Bonner Fellers as the leads show subtle yet passionate performances in their scenes together and with the other wonderful actors, especially with the little known (to North American audiences) Japanese actors.

It wouldn't take much for the resentment to ignite into revolt and the fate of the emperor could be just the spark."" After the Japanese surrender ends WWII the US Government wants to know who was behind the bombing of Pearl Harbor. General Douglas MacArthur (Jones) charges General Bonner Fellers (Fox) with an important mission. Fellers is to decide if Emperor Hirohito should be charged as a war criminal and hung. To make matters even harder Fellers is also searching for his lost love in the midst of the war ravaged country. Being a history buff I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. This movie really shows the tense decision Fellers was charged with, his conclusion really will decide the fate of an entire country as well as relations between the US and Japan. The movie shows the lengths people will go to protect someone they revere as a God and how close the country came to a completely different future. I really enjoyed this being a history buff but I do have to say for people that aren't as interested in this stuff you may find it a little slow.

He had a small part in it, but in my opinion he did a wonderful job.  He had about a 5 minute speech which was quite powerful and moving. Mr. Nakamura has a long list of accomplishments and is very well known in Japan, so I am very happy that he had the opportunity to play an important role in an American movie.
