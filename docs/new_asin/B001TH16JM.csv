8341299,5,B001TH16JM,"""THE VISE"" is a riveting television series from the 1950's. Always exploring provocative themes on the 'metaphorical vise of personal pressure' that ordinary people find themselves in, each of the shows in this series invariably captures the rapt attention of viewers. Perhaps the greatest compliment is the fact that personal reflections on the most recently viewed episode linger on, sometimes for days! The other thing is I like is that each episode of ""THE VISE"" has a totally different cast of actors.  My only complaint is the ALPHA products contain a mere 4 episodes/disc, making them bulky to store and expensive to purchase. Perhaps it's high-time that a box set of these seminal shows gets produced and offered to AMAZON customers!",1412467200,,741,5.12396694214876
