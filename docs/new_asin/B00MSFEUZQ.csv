6600826,4,B00MSFEUZQ,"Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhaniya suffers from a DDLJ hangover, as it unabashedly celebrates the film so much that there are many references to SRK, homage to several scenes, including a scene in which the lead is watching the train station scene at the end of the movie and sheds a tear. Despite the many ripped off situations and a lack of originality it does not stop the film from being watchable.
Kavya, the spoilt daughter of a rich man decides to come to Delhi to shop for her wedding dress and bumps in to Rakesh AKA Humpty Sharma, who is poor. Obviously they fall in love.
The movie is about the old Bollywood cliche about true love conquering all odds and relies on the two young actors to make it work.
The DDLJ hangover is once again evident in the second part when the boy tries to woo the girls family by living in their house. If you are not remote familiar DDLJ is a classic Indian film, but the charm is somehow missing or do the young people even think that such a love is possible in these times.
The songs are ok and one is exceptional- Samjhavan.
While the young actors are no SRK or Kajol - they do an exceptional job and  make this tired plot come alive. Varun Dhavan and Alisha Bhatt hold exceptional promise of future greatness. This movie is watchable just because of them. Released on July 11, 2014.",1450569600,,1319,4.383673469387755
6600827,5,B00MSFEUZQ,"Thoroughly entertaining. The song ""Mein tehu samjhawan"" is a gem and js on constant repeat on my playlist. If you want a fun movie that will make you laugh some and cry some, see this one.",1448496000,,188,4.25

6600830,2,B00MSFEUZQ,"Since when did rudeness, arrogance, materialism, selfishness and generally obnoxious behavior (mixed in with a few, shallow, ""this 5 second scene is to show how sincere/lovable the antagonists are"" moments) become cool and romantic? Karan Johar, you are losing your touch.",1442275200,2,272,5.658536585365853

8674443,4,B00MSFEUZQ,"This movie is thoroughly entertaining especially if you enjoy Bollywood comedy movies. Varun Dhawan as Rakesh Sharma aka Humpty and Alia Bhatt as Kavya Pratap Singh has played their roles nicely. Actually the chemistry between the two while little childish is rather good. There is a single Unplugged Version track ""Mein Tenu Samjhawan Ki"" is sung by actress Alia Bhatt is one of my favorites while that song is not present in the movie the ""Samjhawan"" is a romantic song Single by Shreya Ghoshal and Arijit Singh is also a very good tune.

If you like this movie you will also enjoy the sequel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Badrinath-Ki-Dulhania/dp/B072YS8YYG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Badrinath Ki Dulhania</a>&nbsp;which is also available for streaming on Amazon Prime.

8674449,1,B00MSFEUZQ,There's no way that 50% of the reviewers here gave the film 5 stars. It looks duplicitous! Bollywood the epitome of below average movies  pans out another no-brainer potboiler. I wanted to give it 0 stars but it seems there is no such option! These nincompoop directors feel that Indian audience is trash and can probably lap up anything. Well I for one would never and I am going to be as vocal about my disapproval as I can!,1493078400,,426,4.3924050632911396

8674451,3,B00MSFEUZQ,"In it's own right, this Humpty Sharma movie is a nice enough love story, and feels realistic. I liked it enough for 3 stars. Some may say 'It's not as great as'..., but it has that charm of a Bollywood movie without tooo much singing and dancing in this one.  Yes, some reference, in parts, to the world-renowned Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (also known by the initialism DDLJ, a movie which may seem silly in the first bit but turns into a fantastic movie which is known & loved the world over)..........., But I just enjoyed Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania  as it is, feeling sorry once again for the lovebirds who have to put up or try to break through the walls of archaic family standards which say 'marry who I choose, not for love'.",1465603200,,732,4.4148148148148145
