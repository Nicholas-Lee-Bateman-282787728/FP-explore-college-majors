Before showing each episode, I have them take turns reading( out loud) the questions or fill-in statements on each study guide before viewing. They frequently ask me to pause the episode so they can fill in  correct responses. It is so fun to watch them ""watch "" these fantastic and accurate episodes. They asked me if they could  do research on the historic figures that they ""met"" in these episodes. This is  so refreshing because I was going to have them do that , anyway!

3485315,5,B001B73PO4,"I purchased the 4 disc set. My daughter is 5 (almost 6) and she LOVES this series. She is all about American history right now and this show is perfect! I love how it gets her thinking and asking questions about people, places, events, etc. Highly recommend Liberty Kids for anyone with kids at home who are budding history buffs or just to expose them to history.",1490745600,,364,4.447761194029851

3485317,5,B001B73PO4,"A wonderful depiction of the War for Independence as seen through the eyes of a trio of young, cub reporters for Ben Franklin's newspaper.  Almost no P.C. and inspirational.  Highly recommended, not least because they do a very good job of the Battle of Satatoga a.k.a. the Battle of Freeman's Farm which is our family's historic homestead.",1490400000,,340,4.947368421052632

3485319,5,B001B73PO4,This was my gift to my husband. It was very educational and I would recommend this for high school students who have to stay after school. Just make them watch and they will have to learn.,1489968000,,188,4.25
3485320,5,B001B73PO4,"PERFECT FOR HOMESCHOOL HISTORY CLASS. No subtitles so make sure you have your remote control handy and TV at top volume
 if you have a noisy toddler in the room. WHAT GREAT VALUE! You get so many lessons for so little.",1489536000,,218,4.317073170731708
3485321,4,B001B73PO4,"First thing out of the way:

The show is phenomenal and still as good as I remember growing up with it. It's one of the best edutainment shows ever made due to the blunt and honest way it presents the events. It's very much on side of the colonists, but at the same time it shows the shades of grey involved in the conflict like the abuse of Natives form both sides.

HOWEVER, I have to knock a star off the product as a whole because the DVDs themselves are put together in an exceptionally cheap fashion that makes them almost feel like bootlegs. The menus are literally just a picture with a static loop of the theme song and a play button. There's also some logos like the E/I symbol present that leads to believe they're literally using TV syndication prints.

Be aware that you're buying it for the show itself and not the quality of the DVDs when you buy the cheaper set.",1489104000,,878,4.3090909090909095

3485334,5,B001B73PO4,"Show specifics: My kids love this series. We homeschool and this is really bringing to life some of our American History reading. It introduces most major figures of the Revolution and also some other interesting people like Phyllis Wheatley. When it introduces a new term, it does so with an explanation. It also tracks what was going on in England at the time.
Disk specifics: I did notice some of the occassional fuzziness and reduced picture quality a few others mentioned but honestly it wasn't bad enough to detract from the overall usability, especially given that I paid $7 for this. There are 4 disks with ten episodes on each and no way to choose one episode, you just have to fast forward it, if that sort of thing bothers you.
Overall I think this was definitely worth the money.",1487721600,,791,4.6571428571428575

He doesn't follow everything, so it helps to have me sitting and watching with him to provide further explanation. In some cases, I've gone googling to find more information; I am learning also.

A 7 yr old doesn't seem to care either.  I'm happy if he puts them back in the package.  I didn't know if he would go for this, as I was having trouble getting him interested in his history.  Was I amazed to see him glued to it, to the point where he wanted to sit there and watch every single episode.  I had to pull him away.  He came away talking all about what he'd seen.  Plus, when each episode starts, he jumps up and does his ninja, (or something) dance and sings.  Well worth the cost to actually see him show some interest, and making it much easier to discuss the topics and do other projects and journals.",1475712000,,779,4.03921568627451

It shows real struggles on both sides and also the need and the calling for Independance. The series captures American values at its best and it does feel good to feel patriotic again especially recently with our government putting our country down in front of international community and being apologetic for being a true democracy.,1472515200,,473,5.2368421052631575

The 6-Disc Set has all 40 episodes that is crystal clear and Bonus Features from PBS Kids and the booklet is fun to read. While the 4-Disc Set from Mill Creek has a TV-Y7 on top left and Education logo on the bottom right at the beginning of each episode. So when you are ready to learn about The American Revolution and the 13 Colonies, Buy Liberty's Kids 6-Disc Set from Shout. Do not buy the 4-Disc Set from Mill Creek because it is not worth it.

I try to add games, movies, and activities into learning that get my children's attention and makes them crave knowledge. I purchased this DVD to introduce them to some of the great moments of history.

This is an animated DVD that includes many stories including the Boston Tea Party, The First Fourth of July, The Constitution,and many more. It tells the story in a way that draws children in. The children are learning without even knowing it. It helps them ask questions and want to learn more. We then research on the computer or laptop more about what we were just watching and do projects related to that event.

The kids can watch and re watch this and always enjoys it every time. They see it as a cartoon, not as an educational resource.",1460937600,,888,4.649681528662421

3485486,4,B001B73PO4,This is a great cartoon of the American revolution. Would it be worth the $40 that it was going for no is it worth the $8 it is now yes. Well many of the other reviewers say that it is great for home schooling this isn't just good for teaching about basic concepts and events of the American Revolution it also allows you to establish a timeline of the events as often many times kid will just think it was in the past i don't need to know when it went on. As for the actual quality/picture you can tell this is an older show as it doesn't scale up to hdtvs 1080p if you can get over the looks of the image give it a buy. If you want to know more about how America was founded give it a buy if you want kids to have an established sense of why they should care about history give it a buy.,1460592000,,789,3.876543209876543

That's really okay for me because I just got 40 episodes of an ""educational"" video for my classroom for our 'brain breaks'. (They got a little tired of ""Magic School Bus"" all year long so I got ""Liberty Kids"" and ""Where on Earth is Carmen Sandiego"" to mix it up. For about $5 each, it was a great deal.) I really only wanted the exact episodes that were on the TV. That's not exactly what this was. I have a Discovery Streaming account so my kids can watch about 20 of the episodes online, but they are in no particular order. One of my kids favorite things was the little quizzes and games for the 'commercial breaks'. It also showed me who was really paying attention. These are not on the DVD. Also, if you go to the episode menu and select one episode, as soon as it is over, it immediately goes on to the next one instead of going back the menu.",1434326400,,979,4.157894736842105

3485695,4,B001B73PO4,"I ordered this for my 9 year olds for doing some summer school. We started watching it yesterday, we watched the first 4 chapters... I honestly don't understand how it has such great reviews... My kids love it, especially my daughter. It has a storyline which is what is grabbing her attention.  I'm not sure they really learned much so far.

For example the first chapter is about the tea party. The storyline is about a boy who is a reporter and is looking for a story and gets involved in the tea party situation and sees first hand what is going on. I know what the tea party is but I don't know all the details... I started wondering if this stuff is factual or just a story of made up people trying to explain what happened. I still don't know and I did some research after. I explained to my kids after the 141st episode what it was all about because they didn't know... At the start of the and chapter it gave an overview of the first chapter which was informative. It actually laid everything out like I had just done for my kids. If it could have been a little more to the point in the story I would have liked it better. I get that it needs to be fun for the kids but when you don't understand what the point was it makes things a little irritating.

For $5 I'm sure it was worth it. I just hope it gets better. Plus side is I am doing quite a bit of research to fill in the blanks and I am learning a lot.",1434153600,,1417,4.07168458781362
3485696,1,B001B73PO4,"WE LOVE Liberty's Kids at my house! The 1 star review is for this particular item/seller/manufacturer.

Our original L.K. DVDs were getting worn out, so I came here to replace them. I could not believe the whole set was only $5 and Prime! It has since gone up in price a bit... but anyway. I didn't bother reading the low reviews because it never occurred to me these would be any different than the original manufacturer's.

Our previously purchased L.K. DVDs were much better quality. These are a cheap knock-off.

My son likes to choose which episodes to watch, and this set makes that much more difficult. It continues to play from wherever you start it.

I would recommend Liberty's Kids to anyone! But buy it from the original manufacturer.",1433980800,,746,4.7153846153846155

I was surprise for the visuals, and also the dialogue and interaction. This is A unique way to get the feel and the knowledge of history two kids of all ages between 5 to 12 years of age. Now that's my opinion some younger and some older may love it too !!

This is like a child watching the favorite cartoon show except this favorite cartoon show is going to teach them about American history in a way that is fun and visually memorable!

It is remarkable for who are homeschooling or those who are just helping their kids learn our history!!

I think it will definitely get those who are in school higher grades in history they will remember more. Not only have they read it and books and had it taught by their teacher they've also viewed it on TV as a cartoon

That captures multiple types of learning styles.

I highly recommend it!!!

3485892,5,B001B73PO4,"My daughter LOVED this DVD set! (She is in older elementary) Out of the blue she would tell me tidbits of history information. Finally, I asked where she is learning all of this since I know we did not cover it all in her curriculum. She stated that she learned it all from watching these movies. WOW. She thinks these movies are fun, and easy to understand. She ended watching them on her own 'free' time because she liked them so much and made it through them in no time at all. She told me that this series thoroughly explains things and she now understands what I mean when I say the Civil War was brother against brother. It gave her a new depth of understanding that books just didn't do for her. I am so thankful we found this series.",1421020800,,741,4.26241134751773

3485900,5,B001B73PO4,"I love how much history is packed into one episode.  I feel like the kids and I can watch an episode a few times and learn something new each time.  With around 14 hours worth of material, it will be a while before an episode gets repeated.  Some episodes I saw on regular TV on Saturday mornings a few years ago.  Others, I saw on Netflix, and I was so disappointed when it was removed.  So, I am very excited to be getting the whole thing for $5.00.
I really dislike the way the disks are stored.  When the box is opened, all 4 disks are stacked ontop of each other in the same spot.  I worry about scratching disk 1 or disk 2 while trying to access disk 3.  I feel like the kids shouldn't be allowed to get the disks out of the box, because they might forget to put the top disks back in the case, after getting out the disks that are stored underneath.",1420588800,,856,4.053571428571429

3485910,5,B001B73PO4,"The world's greatest animated serious on the United States Revolution.  We have been long time fans of liberty kids and their mission to educate children about the history of this country.  In the environment we currently live they remind children of the founding principals when our school houses are trying to demolish them and call them out dated.  When my son opened the package at 9 years old, his eyes grew two sizes and he screamed ""LIBERTY KIDS.""  He now owned his very own copy of the greatest animated series about our nations history.  It's non-common core.  It has forty episodes, one for every week of the school year.  It brings up important facts about our nation's history in an entertaining manner with a really catchy theme song.  It's great if you home school, but it's also great fun just to watch.  If you look on the web there are workbook pages for every single episode.  What a shame that every child can't watch liberty kids, but with it on Amazon your can now.  My own son sat through 20 episodes before we finally had to pull him away.  It's that entertaining and it's educational!",1420329600,,1108,4.625641025641026

3485929,5,B001B73PO4,"I didn't actually watch this series as a kid, but having bought this since entering college I've actually found that this is an incredibly compelling, well-written series that can be appreciated by anyone with an interest in American history. Even though this dvd collection consists just of one case with 4 dvds stacked up inside, for such a low price ($5 at my latest look) it is more than worth the money.

This series has well-written characters and doesn't gloss over the events of history (in particular the wrong-ness of slavery) as other shows or books might when talking about the time period around the American Revolution. I can imagine that this would be a great series for teachers or parents to show their children, but also for older high schoolers who want an interesting refresh on the events of the American Revolution (perhaps in a US History or AP US History course).

Do yourself a favor and buy this series and I don't think you'll regret it.",1419552000,,964,4.732142857142857

Instead of stating the important role free blacks(also fought on the side of the British) and native Americans played in winning independence,  the equality subject was played up which was not a major issue for several years after the revolution.

3485953,4,B001B73PO4,"I loved this series as a kid and was so excited when I found this DVD set.

There are a couple of small details that are annoying enough for me to not give this 5 stars:
1. The 4 DVDs are not separated out into sections. There's one little place for the disks and they stack on top of each other, so you can't access any of them at any given point, but instead have to remove the first three to get to the fourth, and so on. A lot of unnecessary handling of the disks.
2. There is only one DVD menu option on each disk that says ""Play All"". There's not an ""Episodes Menu"". You cannot skip around to different episodes within each disk without playing and fast forwarding. With 10 episodes per disk, that's a bit inconvenient.

These are minor details in the long run, but they are still slightly annoying. Other than that, this is a great product and I would highly recommend it.",1418342400,,879,4.226190476190476

Once you have your kids interested (and they  get a wee bit older) I would strongly recommend moving onto anything by David Barton if you would like to get a more realistic representiation of what the Founding Fathers original intent was.

Parents should be aware that, while nothing is gratuitous, the series does not shy way from heavy topics like slavery and the death in war.  The inclusion of children representing both sides in the Revolutionary War was a great way for my son to see the issues and gave us fodder for further research and conversation.  I highly recommend!",1415577600,,461,4.871794871794871

I read the reviews and thought I'd try it since it was so inexpensive and Walter Cronkite developed it.  My nine year old son was immediately hooked.  We are probably spending more time on history than we should.  I've downloaded maps and quizzes that are from the same time.  We have fun while we are both learning.,1413676800,,442,4.4375
3486051,5,B001B73PO4,"OK, sure it is a cartoon but this series gets the job done.  When my son turned six, I offered to take him to Philly, Williamsburg, Monticello, mt. Vernon and Boston if he learned about the American Revolution.  He eagerly watched every one of this series several times.  He also read the famous young American Series of biographies of Washington, Jefferson, Revere, Adams, Franklin and Attucks.  When he finally got to the sites these events took place, he knew more than most of the adults on the tour. Teach you kids history- get these books.",1413590400,,545,4.705263157894737

It is fact-packed, and presents both the American and British points of view on the issues of the day.  This is VERY HELPFUL for my daughter in her 8th grade history class.  It brings the information in her textbook alive and sets it in a context that makes it easy for her to understand and remember.  Until she started watching this series, she thought history was about ""a bunch of boring dead people.""  When she read her textbook, she remembered very little of what she would need for the test, even after reading it numerous times.  After watching the pertinent chapters of this series (each show is about 20 minutes), she was able to take and pass her test without rereading the text at all!  All the major issues were covered by the series, including some that were not even mentioned in her textbook.  Now she watches the episodes before she reads, and what she reads slots right into the story.  She no longer has to read each chapter several times to prepare for her tests! I highly recommend this series as an adjunct to teaching American history.",1413504000,,1135,4.601990049751244

The historical accuracy is excellent, and it's very entertaining for my children (ages 3&6).  My oldest son loves history, and this makes it come to life for him.  I wish I had this when I was in high school to help me with American History!  The battle scenes are not violent, from what I can tell, so far.  Yes, there is fighting and guns, but you never see any blood, wounds, or actual carnage.  It's very appropriate for little ones.  This is a ""must-buy"" to make your kids fall in love with American history!",1409702400,,677,4.491803278688525

3486131,5,B001B73PO4,"I have watched a few of the first episodes with my 9 year old who loves the series.  In watching it, I could see the educational aspects quite easily, though for him, perhaps it was less obvious.  I was impressed that he had already been taught about Phyllis Wheatley in school.  He knew right away that she was a poet.  So there's hitting the major events/people (Intolerable Acts, Boston Tea  Party, John Adams, Sam Adams, Ben Franklin, etc.) and those less well-known people who are introduced into the storyline.

At $5, this video was a steal and it is well worth the investment.

Like other posters mentioned, the discs come stacked and not in individual sleeves or holders.  This is bad for those of us who like our discs to go back into the holder.  When finished with disc 1, I'll have to pop off the other four and put #1 on the bottom.  The more handling of the discs, the more likely an oops will occur.",1409184000,,915,4.425149700598802

They recognize names that they haven't studied yet in school, just from watching these shows.  Very engaging.  Be careful taking the discs out of the case, though.  They are stacked (4 DVDs) in a case that looks like it's designed for just one.  We had one crack trying to take it out.  Wish they would come up with a better case for these, especially since kids are likely to be handling them.  The series is absolutely amazing though.  Buy it.

When I set up to play a DVD, the three requests I get are How It's Made Fun Stuff, Popular Mechanics for Kids, and Liberty Kids.  No matter what I pick, all the kids are all happy.  Even those that go off in a corner to read a book end up watching.  Liberty's Kids is a series and is a bit of a soap opera for the kids.  They know what episode they are on and let me know if I am skipping one.  It may be petty to mention, but I find the opening and closing credits obnoxiously long and the music annoying.  I am not petty enough to deduct a star, though it is tempting, because the kids really like the show and I can fast forward through them.",1406160000,,705,3.8541666666666665

When the show was taken off of the air, I was heartbroken.  This past 4th of July, I was looking for a gift of significance to send to my 6 year old niece.  When I searched Amazon, and these came up, I squealed with delight,  I immediately ordered them for her, my only regret is that she's not here so that we can watch them together.  I called her about a week after I ordered them, and she was watching an episode at the time.  She could not stop talking about the characters (Henry) is her favorite.  She used the French pronunciation, and told me so!  I'm so excited for her to learn about our country's history and share it with her friends.

The cartoon follows the adventures of three children during the American Revolution. There is a boy Colonial patriot teenager, a girl British loyalist teenager, and a young French immigrant pre-teen. They all stay with Benjamin Franklin and work for his newspaper. The teenagers are reporters for him that report on the war from their respective viewpoints. Each episode is a different event in the American Revolution, be it a battle or an important speech. The episodes are all titled in such a way that you can easily find the one that matches with whatever you are covering in your curriculum. The historical figures are voiced by many famous actors and actresses.

I had watched them before I traveled to Boston a year ago and was amazed myself how much I knowledge I had gained from the Liberty's Kids. My class loves to sing the theme song and it is so cute to hear them shout out their favorite line of the song.  ""Red, White and Blue, never give up, you represent America!""

The things I have learned from this series as an adult.

This is a fun series about American history. What an easy way for the kids to learn. They have little games like ""Then and Now"" in the middle of episode breaks. The young main characters are not always sweet and nice but neither are they mean. In other words: they are like real people. I don't think the kids constantly caused the conflict (as they do in some shows). No romance (at least that I recall)! From what I watched, they did try to show the two countries' perspectives fairly. There were bad Americans as well as bad English people. I am also keeping in mind that this is a show for children.

We borrowed this from the library to watch. When a friend told me about the super discount (under $10), I snapped it up last year.

Now the compression doesn't at all effect the PQ, but I was a bit disappointed that these are the syndicated versions that aired from 2005-2008 on ""DiC Kids Network"".

3486295,5,B001B73PO4,"This animated series is well known among parents who value teaching their children about the events of the American Revolution in a fun, engrossing way. In our ever-increasingly visual learning society, being able to see the events of history come to life in an animated show like this really helps kids remember important events in our nation's history. Enough cannot be said about the quality of this show from the writing to the animation, although remember this show is from 2002-2003 so it doesn't have some of the cutting edge graphics of today's animated shows.

NOW, to clear up some things about the format this set comes in:

1. YES, it comes as 4 DVD discs in a single-size DVD case but the storage spindle inside is taller to accommodate multiple discs.

2. NO, the DVDs are NOT hard to get out of the case. Perhaps they have improved the case since some reviewers whined about it being hard to get out...

3. For $7.99 for the entire series of 40 episodes (at the time of this review), there really is nothing to complain about. The 4 discs came in perfect condition and I have had no trouble switching them out of the case. If you prefer, you can always store the discs in a multi-DVD storage case if you don't like switching them out of the case they came in.

What are you waiting for? It's under $10!!",1396569600,,1318,4.497907949790795

It definitely has moments of silliness and humor as it is geared towards kids, but it also acurately depicts historical events in a creative way. History comes alive and is fun rather than text-book sterile.
When after a few months the network started showing episodes out of order and then stopped altogether, I knew I had to purchase the dvd collection so I could see them all.
Not a substitue for a history class or lesson, but an excellent supplement, especially for those who are just being introduced to U.S. History or have a hard time taking an interest in it.",1395446400,,739,4.78125

I cant say enough about how great the show itself is, but I am surprised at the picture quality. I have borrowed discs of this series from the library from what appeared to be the previous version released on DVD and looked great and they had the same amount of episodes per disc, so you could assume probably the same compression, etc. It was noticeable in my first viewing of the first disc from this version that sometimes what should be the clear lines of animated characters are somewhat grainy, fuzzy, or blurry.

3486320,5,B001B73PO4,"I homeschool my granddaughter, and bought these DVDs to supplement her American history lessons.  They have been quite a hit!!  The problem is she wants to watch all of them right away, and not wait to use them in conjunction with her lessons.  She watched six of them yesterday afternoon, and is now ahead of her lessons.

The quality of the videos is really good. They used people you will recognize to play the roles:  Walter Cronkite as Benjamin Franklin, Sylvester Stallone, Michael Douglas, Annette Bening, Dustin Hoffman, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Whoopie Goldberg, Billy Crystal, Ben Stiller, and Liam Neeson.

The action is fast-paced and geared toward older kids and tweens.  The background story involves a girl from England, 2 young boys, and a former slave, all of whom work in the printing office of Benjamin Franklin.  They manage to become personally involved in all the major events leading up to and including the Revolutionary War (you can do anything with animation!).  There is a lot of explanation of events in the dialogue between the characters.  It truly does result in the student learning a lot about the background of the war.

After each episode, we discuss the history behind what we have just watched....the people involved, geographic locations, what led up to the event, and what further events could occur as a result.

For the little bit of money I spent on this series, I certainly got my money's worth with 40 half hour episodes.  We haven't watched all 40 episodes yet, but at the rate we're going, it won't take long!!",1393891200,,1554,4.885496183206107

There are no commercials to worry about, just the programs. The price was excellent. I know people have complained about their being no supplemental material, but I say use the episodes as a starting off point to do research with children who are old enough. Our library has provided lots of great material on the high profile real life characters in the story and the events themselves. A great opportunity to have history in your home.

3486380,5,B001B73PO4,"My first three children enjoyed watching these when it first aired on PBS. And for the most part the facts presented are historically accurate, with these fictional ""journalists"" giving their perspective, ahead of their time, of course. Because it was so inexpensive, I bought the dvd as a gag gift for the youngest of these three for her thirteenth birthday, but she still lit up with delight remembering how much she liked the series. Now the second set of three younger ones (7-10) are enjoying them too, with their big sisters ""filling in the blanks"" of history now that they are so much older and wiser.

Let me be clear, this is entertainment first, and the kids can learn a little history while being entertained by the ""kid journalists'"" antics. As someone whose education/profession is in the mass media, I know for a fact that TV shows and movies are first and foremost entertainment, which can attempt to teach lessons, but they are not education. Educational TV is an oxymoron. Education is participatory and demands a response, not passive absorption of information. However, since TV & movies are part of their entertainment, then I would prefer they have substance, like this series, as opposed to the idiotic, disrespectful preteens on the Disney channel.

If you are a mom or dad concerned with TV's influence on kids' education, I would also recommend for further study, Amusing Ourselves to Death&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Amusing-Ourselves-Death-Discourse-published/dp/B00E28XTI6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Amusing Ourselves Death Discourse published</a>

3486382,4,B001B73PO4,"My children, in their teen years, even enjoyed this series.  They have played the Liberty Kids computer game many, many times.  It is fun to see the characters again in a different medium.  The first couple of episodes in the series weren't that great, but they got much better.  It's a good way to get a quick overview of the founding of our great country.

Homeschoolers, and other educators, may find this particularly helpful.  A suggestion would be to watch an episode on Monday, then spend the rest of the week going into more depth on the event discussed.  The older students could also check for accuracy in the presentation of the facts. This way the videos can be used as a springboard for further discussion, and an outline for the study.

I would recommend this series to others, especially at the low price I paid.  I got it while on special for like $5.99  Always LOVE to save!",1388448000,,891,4.547169811320755

It has beautiful animation, well-crafted music, interesting dialogue, and is fun for the kids to watch. All of that would mean nothing if it wasn't accurate, but it is! It introduces all the people kids need to know about from that time & why they were important, from George Washington to Benedict Arnold to Phyllis Wheatley to Ethan Allen. It shows both sides to every conflict by having the major characters be of totally different backgrounds & social statuses. They cover slavery & treason very honestly but in a way that is okay for even small children. They don't only show the noble heroics, but also the everyday life & challenges. It brings the story to life in a way that keeps the kids engaged & learning. Because of this series, my 1st graders can tell you more about the American Revolution than most college kids.
I truly wish the people who made this would do the same for other periods of history. (They did do ""Treasure Island,"" though. So that was cool.)",1387929600,,1052,4.661290322580645

My son can talk about history with our 3rd grade neighbor intelligibly. His teachers are amazed by his knowledge of history. I must give all of the credit to Liberty Kids.

Pros:
Gives fun history lessons in the form of cartoons which most kids love.
Episodes are long enough to keep it interesting, but short enough to keep their attention.
Enjoyable for my 3 year old as well!

Cons:
Discs are stacked in the case.  That is the only con I have, which made me give it four stars, as I'm worried they're going to get damaged eventually, and it makes it difficult to pick the disk without removing each one.

Verdict:
For the price, you can't beat it.  If your kids like cartoons and you want them to watch something educational as a compromise, get this!  It'll be worth it!",1387324800,,712,4.4728682170542635

The theme song is not my style and a couple of the characters or interactions are silly.  However, this is written in a captivating enough style to hold most viewers' attention.

Though the 3 main characters are fictional, I like how the story weaves these characters around historical figures. The story follows 1 child and 2 teens that work for Benjamin Franklin at his Philadelphia Gazette. They experience and report on the major people and situations of that time period. There are some difficult themes (war, slavery, injustice), but they are not presented in graphic ways. For younger elementary age children, it is helpful to stop and explain what is happening. Overall, the series is very engaging. Our whole family enjoys watching them (young elementary - adult).",1385164800,,709,5.068376068376068

Yes, the discs are stacked on top of one another, but they fit snugly in place, and I didn't have any trouble with them slipping around in the case. The case and discs are in good condition and it arrived in good time. The show itself is great for kids. I bought this for the purpose of supplementing history lessons in homeschooling, and I think it's going to work great! It not only teaches history, but it also gives a lot of good lessons about equality for every race and gender. And with shipping, I only spent $10, so it was a great deal. There are 40 episodes, 10 to a disc, and there's some great voice talent on it. So I'm very pleased. I would definitely recommend this item. Now, if you want all the extras like the Now and Then segments and the booklet, etc., there's another version of this product that costs a lot more ($75), but this one is just the DVDs. It depends on what you're looking for and what you're willing to spend. If I had the money, I would probably buy the more expensive one to get all of the extras, but this is a great option for me, since it allowed me to buy the episodes without having to pay more for the extra features.",1382400000,,1274,4.182926829268292

3486488,5,B001B73PO4,"This animated series was injected into the 7:00AM to 8:00AM time slot on Saturday mornings by CBS, during the 2012 to 2013 season. Since I am an early riser, I would always catch a cartoon before watching the news at 8:00AM. When this series came on...I was nearly immediately engrossed. Although the series is not completely in step with U.S. History as we know it, for the most part it holds the line and is very entertaining. The characters are really good, and it doesn't take long to develop a connection with each. As the series came to the point where we had won our independence, I remember asking...""where do they go from here""? I researched online and quickly determined that this was a singular season program, and had no follow-up seasons.

I purchased this DVD for my ""hopefully"" soon to be Grand-Children. I think this series offers a terrific introduction to this nations history, and might encourage them to be more formidable in their studies.",1381968000,,960,4.783132530120482

You can watch it on Youtube, but this is easier. The ONLY thing I don't like about it is the way the episodes continue into each other without a clear break and without a DVD menu breakdown of episodes. So I can't say to my kids, ""Go watch the next episode of Liberty's Kids"" while I do something else. They have to remember where they left off, and they frequently watch past where I want them to stop because they don't know to stop. Otherwise, great!

3486516,5,B001B73PO4,"I have recently been reading books about the American Revolution (including Thomas Fleming's ""Washington's Secret War"" and ""The Perils of Peace"") and I was delighted to see the historical information presented so accurately in this animated series. I have been intrigued by this series since seeing a few episodes on TV several years ago, but I wondered whether it had a revisionist or politically correct bias.

Having just watched the series (gulping down multiple episodes at at time, often with my husband at my side), I was quite pleased with the overall historical accuracy. There are a few things which are not *quite* right... the show does not mention the animosity which John Adams felt for Benjamin Franklin (as peace negotiators in Europe), and fails to clearly portray Cornwallis' refusal to personally surrender to Washington at Yorktown. But time and again I found myself thrilled as events that I have enjoyed reading about were depicted in detail on the screen.

I was surprised- in a good way- at the lack of ""dumbing down"". Although some simplification was necessary, the plot lines are quite complex and some scenes include actual quotations from period documents. Some of this, I expect, would go over a younger child's head. And although death and suffering are shown with admirable delicacy for a show that depicts a war, there are a few parts that could be frightening for younger children- for example, the episode that explains the physical pain caused by tarring and feathering people.

Since the show was produced for children, there are ""cartoonish"" elements thrown in from time to time- such as when the main characters escape the British by rolling down a street in barrels. The two teenage characters bicker with each other frequently and display attitudes that are not always fit for role models. Parents may wish to take this into account and discuss these interactions with their children. The fictional ""main characters"" in this show do take a lot of screen time, but it's usually as a means of drawing the viewer into the historical events.

The show makes an attempt to portray how the American Revolution impacted multiple groups of people- especially the slaves living in America at the time, but it also gives a token nod to the Native Americans and the Jewish population. Multiple episodes dealt with the issue of slavery, and attempted to show how the Founding Fathers could both own slaves themselves *and* wish to end the practice of slavery. American patriots were shown in a fairly balanced way. They were depicted as sometimes noble and great, sometimes angry and rash, sometimes fighting for freedom, sometimes taking advantage of the war for their own profit. The infighting, arguing, and backstabbing that actually occurred in Congress was shown as well, although much of the overseas drama (between the American ambassadors, as well as European nations) was not dealt with much aside from some angry scenes involving Parliament and/or King George.

As an adult, I really enjoyed watching these years in American history unfold in sequence. It helped me see the big picture and it was interesting to watch so many of the events and characters I've read about come to life, even in animated form. I do recommend this show- for adults as well as children.",1380240000,,3304,5.0109289617486334

3486527,4,B001B73PO4,"If you're a history buff or into the American Revolutionary era this is a great informative series for children. I remember the original run on my local PBS channel. Granted I'm not the target demographic but I was instantly hooked upon watching the first episode. The show took you by the hand and tried to give you a semblance of what life was like during the Revolutionary War. Most of the perspective was through the eyes of the children featured in the series.

This is a great educational tool for children for learning about the formative years of the country. It's a good PG show that any parent can feel comfortable in knowing that this is something their children can watch without worry. For the price offered here on Amazon and the run time, almost 900 minutes, this is a bargain.

I was amazed to learn how many different actors did voice work for the series. Truly a standout in the field of network cartoons. I had wished it had run longer, but being originally aired on PBS I am grateful that it ran for the brief time that it did air. I consider myself lucky I had come across it during it's initial run. Since it has been re-released, this is the second production run on DVD, I had to pick up a copy.

For educational purposes it's great for the intended target audience. For adults, it depends on whether you are into American history or the Revolutionary War. This is an excellent learning tool in a format that can hold most children's attention. I would think this would be a great tool in the classroom as well.

There is action,suspense and decision making that the characters have to deal with that make children think while they're learning about facts. It brings the Revolution into their world. My husband and I have seen a few episodes and would love to watch the whole thing in order someday!
 The show has created questions about the Revolution and American History in general. They are now comparing it to the Civil War (which they are learning about because this was interesting to them). It was the DVD of choice as we drove across the country this summer on our trip. They seem to understand better loyalty,faith and respect of not only our country but I think of people who have to make tough decisions.

She befriends fourteen-year-old James Hiller, eight-year-old Henri Richard Maurice Dutoit LeFevbre, and Moses. At first Sarah is dedicated to her home country England, but towards the end of the series she clearly understands why the Thirteen Colonies wanted their freedom.

""WE THE PEOPLE""

Liberty's Kids is wonderfully animated series with a great voice cast, including several big name guest-voices, but the main focus of the series is to teach children about the American Revolution. There are only forty episodes in the series, but it does have a satisfying ending with the ratification of the U.S. Constitution in 1789. I do think it is odd that the children never age during the span of six years, but I guess that is the reason why it is called a cartoon. Overall, I enjoyed watching this well-written cartoon series and I recommend it to others.

It did NOT come with anything but 4 DVD's stacked on top of each other. I made a claim with Amazon & stated that it was missing these things. So they sent me a new one... Exact same thing.... Obviously (now) it's not supposed to come with these.

$10 bucks is a good price for the DVD's - but we homeschool and I was really looking forward to all of the extras so we could use those along with it.  Amazon needs to remove that line from the review. It's VERY misleading.",1375228800,,853,4.635761589403973

An ambitious, 40-episode animated series created for PBS, I would hope that ""Liberty's Kids"" might have been utilized by some teachers to augment their American history curriculum. (Not to replace, mind you, but augment.) When I was a kid, history was kind of dry, but this series is a great way to bring what is really a very exciting story to a level that kids understand, are compelled by (my kids saw every one when they were young) and avoids being too stilted.

Young people are the fictional lead characters who thread us through real events throughout the Revolutionary War Period. It's not the first time cartoon watchers have seen this narrative technique. Archie comics have been doing it for decades and of course, CBS broadcast their final Filmation Archie series, ""The U.S. of Archie,"" with the conceit that Archie and his friends somehow had ancestors during every crucial period in American history. Then there's ""This is America, Charlie Brown,"" which didn't even explain how the Peanuts characters materialized in these historic settings.

""Liberty's Kids"" doesn't star familiar cartoon characters. Instead, it stars a very impressive roster of celebrity guest voices. The combination of acting styles sometimes clash a bit, between the voice actors specific kind of style, the somewhat naturalistic approach of certain star voices and the rather surprising casting of others.

To their credit, the stars do give their all. But once I discovered Billy Crystal was voicing John Adams, I had the same challenges Phil Harris fans had when watching ""The Jungle Book."" The personality is just too ingrained in my head. Sorry to single him out, as Crystal has proven quite capable of drama before and he does not phone in John Adams here. But he's very distinctive, especially now that Mike Wazowski has appeared in two hit movies. Even though Ben Stiller has also voiced the lead in the Madagascar movies, his voice is not as unmistakable as Crystal.

And it's not like Walter Cronkite isn't unmistakable too. Cronkite was not an actor, but he was a master of presenting words and you would not expect him to be anyone but himself in the role of Ben Franklin, who is the only continuing adult character in the series.

DIC's animation is very much the slick TV type you might see in an upscale direct-to-DVD movie, with elaborate execution in some places and limited movement in others. The writing is uniformly solid, scripted by such primetime veterans as Bill Dial (""WKRP in Cincinnati"") and Marc Zicree (""Star Trek: The Next Generation""). The best moments are not necessarily the ""big"" historical ones, but rather the lesser known, realistic details, such as a scene in which James, the young reporter, assumes that tar and feathering is a laugh fest until he is told how horrifyingly painful it is.

This is a very affordable reissue of the complete series. It should be noted that it, contains the dramatic content of the episodes without the interstitials that replaced commercial breaks on PBS. An earlier set did include them as separate bonus features. They do not advance the narrative but if you want them, you may want to seek out the earlier release.

3486589,3,B001B73PO4,"I love that Liberty's Kids is being offered at such a great price. I got it for my daughter on pre-order. One of the main reasons that she wanted the DVDs, is for the Continental Cartoons and other things that are on the other DVD set. The description under editorial reviews, clearly states that these are included on the $9.99 version. However, they are not. She can watch them on Youtube without these features. She wanted the DVD for the extras. Very disappointed at being misled. No complaints about the series. The show is wonderful! It really encourages a love of learning.",1374192000,,580,4.696078431372549
3486590,3,B001B73PO4,"If you are looking for a great show to help your kids learn about the American Revolution, this is it.  It is engaging, entertaining and dramatic, but geared towards a younger audience.  If they are younger than 10 (like my kids are), you should probably watch it with them to help them with some of the terminology and to help them understand historical context and the sequence of events.  But even with that, my kids still love it, and I am learning details about that period that I didn't know before.

The reason for the three stars is that this particular DVD product is poorly done.  There are 4 DVD discs all crammed inside a single DVD disc case.  All four discs are stacked on top of each other and jammed onto one DVD slot.  Hard to get out and hard to put back.  Also, the description from Amazon.com under Editorial Reviews says ""Also included are Benjamin Franklins Newsbytes, Continental Cartoons, Now and Then, Mystery Guest Game, original pencil tests, a 40-page booklet with a historical timeline, and a pullout poster with a United States map.""  Total fabrication - none of those are present.  There is no insert in the DVD case at all, and the DVDs contain only the episodes WITHOUT the 'commercial' breaks (Newsbytes, Now and Then, etc.).  Honestly, I don't really care about the booklet or timeline or map.  But I am upset that the other cartoon bits are left out - they made a great break in the action, the defined a lot of words that appear in the episodes, and they provided good historical context for the events.  It is the loss of a great part of this teaching tool, especially if you are getting these for younger children.",1374192000,,1653,4.581632653061225
3486591,5,B001B73PO4,"I remember this series when it first came out and I always remembered thinking that this was a great way to teach kids about history, so you can guess that I was excited to see this finally coming out on DVD!  My eldest daughter loves history so when I shared this with her she was both excited and fascinated and when she watched it, she was captivated and did not want to stop. I know she enjoyed watching it, as afterward she started getting more books on history from our local library as well as giving mom and dad quizzes on some of the things that she learned (always a good sign). The series is definitely a great tool to assist kids in learning about history. Through great characters and a fun story line your kids will be drawn into the DVD and will not want to stop as well (just like my own daughter).

Great educational program, packed with lessons.  It's a chronological journey through the Country's birth and early development with each episode dedictated to 1 key event such as the Boston Tea Party.  It can be tough to get my kids to watch educational programs and yet on this one they're sucked in from the starting theme song.",1372982400,,502,4.735632183908046

It has provided them with an exception clear overview of the American Revolution and started really interesting conversation about tariffs, taxation, how to structure a government, loyalty, and slavery. I saw a complaint that it follows the kids to much. I will admit I found it odd that the kids who are the lynch pins never age; on the other hand it provides continuity to a very disjointed war and helped my kids follow ""the plot"". Now they have the basics, they have been able to tie together places we have passed and different names. Will this teach your kids everything about the American Revolution, no; but my kids already have a far better outline than I had by the time I reached high school. Also, I like the fact that while it is not graphic, they deal head on and early in the series that people die. My youngest can be a little callous war. We've talked a lot about what it means to go to war, but I think this actual gave him a good insight without being too heavy.

Will this help them at all when they get into middle school or beyond when American History is really taught?  Doubtful.  I have only seen a few episodes of this when it was new I back then I didn't think it would have a very long life span.

It isn't a bad show by any means and that is the reason for the 3 star review.  If you want your kids to watch something then this is better than anything else I guess.  The animation itself is budget, not even up to par with the other shows on PBS.  for $10 I guess you can't go wrong though.

3486601,5,B001B73PO4,"When I first saw this T.V. show was sometime during fourth grade. Amongst shows like Arthur and Redwall, Liberty's Kid's was one of my favorites. I enjoyed how their was just enough action for someone my age to get into the story and how flawlessly they incorporated real life facts. The greatest memory I had was when my teacher was going over the words of Thomas Paine in the Crisis. She said ""these are the times"", I responded ""that try men's souls"". Suffice to say I had scored not only an A, but a hundred percent for that entire portion of history. If any parent wants to find a show that would teach their child while having their child enjoy the show, I HIGHLY recommend this series. The only portion that I can recall that is inaccurate would be that the Declaration of Independence was not entirely the work of Jefferson, but was assisted with other founding fathers including Ben Franklin and that it was not signed in a committee but that it was sent to different individuals and that the last signature did not happen until around September. Obviously these are facts that are known more by historians and the likes, but for that to be the only true inaccuracies is pretty good. Thanks to this show, I have replicas of the Declaration of Independence, Constitution, Bill of Rights and the Gettysburg Address on the walls of my room.",1369267200,,1345,4.608333333333333

They can write a biographical sketch about all the major players in the Revolution including some you may not have heard of.  It promotes the role of women during the war and goes the additional mile by including women sometimes overlooked by historians, including Abigail Adams, Phyllis Wheatley, Margaret Corbin, etc.  It's an accurate look at the times and the characters, presented in a meaningful chronology, and voiced by familiar celebrities from our time, including Walter Cronkite as Benjamin Franklin.

3486644,4,B001B73PO4,"Our three homeschooled kids, ages 7, 11, & 12, are all enjoying this series immensely. I like it, too.

But first, the bad, which is really not very bad: The show has some lame aspects, like unnecessary tension among the  adolescent protagonists. Why can't they be a mutually respectful team? The competitive and scornful attitude is an annoyance in much of contemporary children's media; somehow it's supposed to be funny or engaging or perhaps especially realistic when the characters are petty. Fortunately, in real life people are usually better than this, if they are living in reasonably comfortable circumstances. Smart people don't tolerate such abrasiveness; they look for better friends and refuse to trust those who consistently talk to them in a demeaning way. But whatever. This is just the show trying to be normal kids' cartoon fare.

Another lame aspect is the horrible music at the beginning. It's an unnecessarily lengthy introduction, always repeated in full, with an angsty teen-sounding female vocalist whose lyrics bother my kids. (""Mommy, why is she saying 'feeling my pain while innocence dies?'"") So, we always fast-forward through the opening, about 1.5 minutes into the show, and then enjoy the dramatization of the actions of great figures in American history.

The good, which is very good: My kids are learning the geography of the Revolution and becoming very familiar with themes like the involvement of the press in shaping the emergent national character of Americans; the gradual adjustment of the colonies to a unified, federal perspective; the competing interests of colonial residents who were diverse socioeconomically;  the practical challenges of maintaining an army; the reality that death and loss are elements of revolutionary progress.

All of this, depicted in such a way that I do not cringe at my 7-year-old's exposure to violence! There are no visual representations of bloody death--at least in the episodes we've seen so far, up to the execution of Patrick Henry--but there are clear representations of the sadness of losing loved ones and respected leaders and mentors.

It's all very easy to understand, pared down to a simple lesson or two in each episode. The three main characters (plus their pals Ben Franklin and his fictional assistant Moses the freed slave) anchor the narrative so that viewers can be moved along by the story, in order to take in new information easily, each time.

I recommend this for children at least 2nd grade and up. It might be too violent for some sensitive viewers at this age, but I think it's OK for kids who are old enough to learn facts about the Revolutionary War in the first place.",1354060800,,2675,5.0636363636363635

Your child may never be a historian or a lover of history, but watching this series will give them a platform in how America came to be. It won't hurt adults either.

The main characters are two kids (not clear how old, might be teenagers) who are writing for Ben Franklin's Philadelphia Gazette - James, who's partial to the patriots, and Sarah, who considers herself a loyal British subject.  Their interactions are funny, especially when they are fighting, and they make sure they get to see and report on all the important events of the day.  One suggestion would be to incorporate the bonus material - the quizzes and news items - into each episode as was original to the TV show.  It's odd to watch all the bonus material at the end of the episodes.  All in all, this was a great series.",1326240000,,799,4.513888888888889

It's a hidden gem.  I'd never heard of this series before but am glad we found it. It is sparking an interest in history, especially for our 8 year old, but both of them ask lots of questions when it is playing. It introduces the irony that while we fought to be a ""free"" country (or at least ""free"" from British rule), at the same time we were a slave owning country. One of the main characters, Moses, is a Freeman, and always carries a letter from Benjamin Franklin attesting to his Freeman status.  As an adult, it is spurring me to try to pick apart the fact from fiction (the main characters including Moses, all appear to be fictional, while of course the historical ones like Benjamin Franklin are ""real"".  Luckily, the series has a web site which helps you identify the real from the fictional, just in case you need to help your kids identify real history from fictional backstory: [...]. I wish there were more kids shows like this that combined the two in such an appealing way.

I now homeschool my 9 & 10 year old daughters and thought this might be a handy series while studing the American Revolution. My daughters LOVED this series. They watched all of the episodes in 2 days because they didn't want to stop. They have watched them several times now and I often hear them say remember on Liberty Kids they showed...... So Liberty Kids has been a wonderful addition to our homeschooling!
DVD's are bright colorful and very well done. By introducing the kids to actual historical characters it makes them so much more real that just reading about them. Makes history 3D and gives characters personality. Takes learning to another level that I think more kids can learn from.
I would highly recommend them to anyone for great, clean, educational and fun viewing.
Teachers - since this was originally a TV series the episodes are set up for half hour shows. Minus the time that they had commericals, each episode is probably around 20 minutes. I would think these DVD's would be a huge help to you too and you could play one a day.

The videos make the personalities involved seem more present-day, and the video children (James the journalist, Sarah the Brit helping Americans, and Henri the little French boy) have modern attitudes and expressions.

There is not too much gritty reality in the battle scenes.  We like them, but I don't use these as a substitute for actual biographies.  I do let my kids watch them (even down to the kindergartener) -- I'm pretty strict about TV, but these make the cut.",1312848000,,648,5.018691588785047

3486685,5,B001B73PO4,"I used to hate the dates that I had to memorize for history, the facts that meant nothing to me but a passing grade. But that was before I began to watch Liberty's Kids. It takes the boring and seemingly uneventful dates and facts of the American Revolution and makes it interesting for the most hardened of history haters.
  Liberty's Kids takes you into the lives of Sarah and James, two typical colonial teenagers who are apprentice journalists for the Pennsylvania Gazette, Benjamin Franklin's newspaper. Sarah is a proper Englishwoman just off the boat from London, while James is a hot-headed young colonist, eager to be rid of the oppressive British rule. The story also includes Henri, a young French scalawag who tags along on their adventures. He is constantly chased and made to behave by Moses, a freed black slave that works for Dr. Franklin in his print shop. The episodes follow their adventures as they report on most of the major events of the American Revolution, often butting heads on key issues along the way. They meet many famous figures, such as George Washington, John Paul Jones and Benedict Arnold.
  For many years, Liberty's Kids was on PBS. Its kid friendly animation and appeal towards younger audiences made it very popular with teachers and parents who wanted their children and students growing up with a knowledge and love of their great country. Now that is no longer aired on T.V. it's now available on DVD, all 40 episodes.
  Watching Liberty's Kids provided an influence on me growing up. No matter what, I always remembered the lessons I had learned sitting on front of the television. I never forgot that Paul Revere rode throughout the night to get to Lexington and Concord. When I went to Yorktown I was surprised and a little disappointed that the buildings were nothing like they were in Liberty's Kids. Recently my little sister started watching the episodes on DVD. I walked into the living room where she was in front of the television. I found myself glued to the screen, living my past as I watched the Boston Tea Party and the Battle of Bunker Hill. It was then I knew that I had to ""return to my roots"", in a matter of speaking, and bring this wonderful series to the attention of those who had perhaps been deprived in their childhood of the joy of learning about how our great nation was founded.",1301788800,,2350,4.705596107055961
3486686,5,B001B73PO4,"Liberty's Kids is an astounding tool for teaching American history: it is entertaining, remarkably accurate and detailed, and perhaps most importantly it does not shy away from the compelling and enduring questions which have shaped and are still shaping American history. Following the lives of several young people and highlighting the main events and personalities of the American Revolutionary War, it gives a multi-dimensional perspective while also covering the kind of facts which students might be expected to know for standardized tests. I wish there were similar series covering other times and places, because it is as valuable a resource as I have seen for kids and young adults. As a teacher, I think it is best suited to ages 10-14, but older and younger viewers will enjoy it as well.",1300492800,,799,5.106870229007634

By the 4th of July, they are done.  Each episode is an account of a different event that shaped our country and brought about the Am. Revolution.  The show is so well crafted that we don't tire of them and learn something new every time we watch.  I love how they've humanized the events, yet maintained historical accuracy and just the right amount of detail for young and growing audiences.  Only complaint is that there aren't other series like this.  I'd love to see one on the Am. Civil War, WWI, WWII, etc..",1299715200,,672,4.370967741935484

In the opening minutes, the ""Patriots"" are depicted as a beer swilling, screaming rabble ready for a fight.  The heroine is in immediate peril due to the ""patriot"" rabble threatening to burn the ship she is on.  I didn't need to see more...

He is constantly reflecting on concepts about our freedom and our nation, slaves, soldiers, colonists, and battles, and he has come up with lots of comments and questions for us.  I am impressed with the gripping manner in which the stories are told, drawing the child (and adults!) in and teaching him/her about our past in a way that helps him/her reflect on our present.  America's greatness is presented here in a way children can understand and love, and this is exactly what I wanted my kids to appreciate.  This series hit the nail on the head.

3486691,5,B001B73PO4,This is an amazing series to teach everyone about the American Revolution. It gives the perpectives of both sides and tells true stories that are rarely heard.

3486692,4,B001B73PO4,"The series starts with the Boston Tea Party (from which the Tea Party gets it's name) and ends with George Washington becoming the 1st President. It tries to be somewhat politically correct. The stories focus on an apprentice of Benjamin Franklyn's, a freed slave named Moses, a French boy, and to make it fair and balanced, a British girl sympathetic to the Crown. There's a trend now when telling the story of the American revolution to tell try to also tell the view from the British sympathizers. That's all fine and dandy, but the idea of a British sympathizer cavorting around with Revolutionaries and not having a problem with them - - even helping them sometimes -- is far fetched (impossible actually). She also didn't seem disappointed at the end of the series when the British lost, either. There's no mention of God or Church -- also far fetched for 18th century New Englanders. But by the same token, at least they DON'T try to re-invent the Founding Fathers as a bunch of atheists or Deists as some historians are trying to. That's where you fill in the gaps and tell the kids the Founding Fathers were actually Christians. President Obama will be disappointed to see Muslims played no part in the founding of our country, which is 100% correct...the series got that part right too. No mention of Muslims discovering America, as some history revisionists are claiming (because they didn't), or how Muslim culture played a part in the development of our country as Mr. Obama claims (it didn't). So even though you might find one or two things glossed over in the series, at least they didn't go nuts! This show came out in 2002, back when it was still OK to be patriotic after 9-11. The series probably wouldn't stand a chance now, unless it aired on FOX News. One episode features a Jewish Founding Father which upset a John Bircher type reviewing the series on here...but tough, get over it, there were Jewish people in America too. There's no violence or bloodshed in the series, which some people might find odd when covering the Revolutionary War, but you can also show it to your 5 year old and not worry. You couldn't do that with Mel Gibosn's ""Patriot"" (although it also is a remarkable film, show to the kids when they're old enough). As far as kids liking it, I haven't seen one yet that didn't. The great thing about cartoons is kids can watch the same ones over and over and over until they've memorized every single line and they don't get tired of it, so it's a great way to get them to memorize events in U.S. history. I'd say, watch Liberty's Kids WITH your kids, explain what's happening, and quiz them on what's going on. It's certainly educational, but like all educational material it needs a facilitator.",1289260800,,2738,4.659090909090909

3486696,3,B001B73PO4,"Politically correct propaganda. (Propaganda is 90% truth.) Written to promote an inaccurate reflection of factual events by those with a vested interest in the mental programming of young people and future adults in believing in such propaganda. Kind of like the lie that the ""war of northern aggression"" (aka the civil war) was about slavery instead of European banking interest trying to break up the country into 2 pieces to fully control it. Or like the lie that Lincoln was the great emancipator. (Not!) ""Moses"" was the code name of Benjamin Franklin by the secret society that he belonged to. Not a freed slave working for Ben Franklin as depicted. Slavery is discussed here as if it were the topic of the day every day. Puke. Overplayed to make Americans of that time appear in a negative fashion. Typical of Hollywood today. (Notice who all of the bad guys are in today's movies.) It also tries to portray a Jewish man as if he were an Israelite when their very own (Jewish) encyclopedia states that it is incorrect to portray Jewish people as Israelites. (Notice the ethnicity of the writer. Can't even leave modern politics out of it.) I realize that it was meant for children, but that is how you program adults. You program them as children. Then there is the ""myth of the noble savage"" theme running throughout as well. Otherwise, if you know the FACTUAL history and need a refresher course in it, it is entertaining and the graphics are very good. You will also notice that the face of Sarah and the face of James are idenitical. Their hair, lips, eyebrows, etc. are  slightly different, but otherwise, there is a lack of originality bewteen these two visually. (Must be why they never kiss!) They also rarely change clothes. The same clothes are worn 98% of the time. Question: Did we really ever win independence from the British when the same British Rothschild banking interest that controlled us then, controls us today out of the ""Crown"" in the ""City of London""? Hmmmmmmmmmm. Maybe they were afraid that we were catching on to them and the money scam they run on us after the events of 9-11 has blown up in their face?",1280448000,,2138,4.701333333333333

With this in mind, I went to the library hoping to find a kid friendly video resource to help her sort out the key characters and events of the war.  I found this video series and my kids (girl 9 / boy 6) absolutely loved the series from the first episode.  As adults, my husband and I find the series well done, educational and entertaining.  As there are so many episodes, there was no way to finish all during our library check out period and we had to continually check it out.  After weeks of doing so, we decided to just buy the series.

3486708,5,B001B73PO4,"While Liberty's Kids, is an animated story set in the time of Colonial America, it is also an outstanding introduction to the life and times of the people of the Revolution as seen through the eyes of two teenagers, Matt Hiller (American) and Sarah Phillips (British) along with a tag-a-long young French boy, Henri.  As apprentices to Benjamin Franklin at the Pennsylvania Gazette, these three kids have adventures taking them to the people and places made famous in Colonial History.

While the show is animated it is anything but a cartoon.  It is in fact a fine introduction to Revolutionary War American History and won't fail to hold you attention for each of the half hour episodes.  History if often a dry recital of dates, places and people but Liberty's Kids makes history come alive as you follow the trio from place to place as they gather the news for Dr. Franklin's paper.

The creators of the show did an outstanding job not just as artists and animators but also as historians in telling you the story of to how American gained its independence.  While primarily aimed at children from ages 8-14, adults will find the shows compelling.  It's quite addicting.  Once you see an episode you will want to see more.

Liberty's Kids is an amazing PBS Kids TV Show (sadly they took it away though :() that introduces children to the Revolutionary War.

They don't go too far into the slavery topic because they want to keep it ages 7 and up, but they go far enough into it that it's understandable.

It was a little hard for me to understand some of the vocabulary (example: colonies, Parliament) when I was younger, but after learning about it in school I understood them well. :)

Anyway, the only reason I rated this 4 stars instead of five is because just like the original DVDs, they don't show the ""Continental Cartoons"", ""LNN"", ""Mystery Guest"", or ""Now And Then"" things they did in the original TV show. They do have then as Special Features, but not in the episodes.

It seems to be a very accurate series as well as entertaining. I think my parents even learned a lot from it. I'm now 16 and I can't wait to buy this series to brush up on my history.

Topics within the framework of the story lines include slavery (from both sides), changing viewpoints, infighting in Congress, insights into why Benedict Arnold turned traitor, impressment, how Britian treated run-away slaves who choose to fight in exchange for promised freedom, how the war affected the Native American tribes, and is freedom worth fighting and dying for.

It also makes the viewer think of  details, relationships and logistics from the shoes of the people who lived through it all. It's all very well thought out and performed. No wonder so many well known television and movie personalities got involved. I liked the period appropriate fiddle music used to facilitate some of the scene changes. My only gripe is the lack of explanation for taxation. England was broke after fighting against the French and Native Americans. But my gripe is small compaired to all the praise Liberty Kids deserves. Both sides, Patriots and Loyalists, are portrayed as the opinionated, passionate, hot headed human beings we tend to be.

3486754,5,B001B73PO4,"See?  What did I tell ya?  Patience is a virtue, and I'm absolutely willing to wait for October to get the ENTIRE series of Liberty's Kids for the far-more reasonable price of forty-four bucks!

As I've mentioned in the Teacher's Edition, this is the far better deal out there (seriously, what teacher can pay 500+ dollars for ONE show?  Is PBS really that unaware of most teachers' ridiculously low salaries?  I don't know . . . maybe they expect ""the school"" to buy it for their library or something -- but which school would pay that much cash for a six-disc DVD set?)

So . . . on with my review of the series:

I've loved this show since I first saw it back in early 2003. During AP US History, this show actually helped incite curiosity and understanding for the complex period that is the American Revolution. It's also the series that made me curious into looking into American History deeper, and reading up on the finer details of America's birth.

The timeline, which features events from the Boston Massacre to the ratification for the US Constitution, is actually quite accurate -- they merely paint into the story the fictional characters of James (the teenage American-patriot), Sarah (the unsure British-loyalist), and Henri (the younger French-sidekick) alongside the historical Founding Fathers.

First airing on PBS, the 40 half-hour episodes are actually quite close to being a half-hour long each (with no commercials originally intended, we get to enjoy more story, as well as fun trivia breaks in between the main story, hosted by James, Sarah, Henri, and even Dr. Franklin).

Among other things to enjoy are the theme song, ""Through My Own Eyes,"" as well as the wide range of voice actors (the cast ranges from Walter Cronkite as Ben Franklin to Billy Crystal as John Adams, with Governor Schwartzenegger, Whoopi Goldberg, Aaron Carter and many more familar voices from Hollywood).

So, yes be sure to buy this series, you won't be dissapointed -- it's wonderfully smart, historically accurate, and great fun for the whole family and you'll be surprised to actually learn loads from it . . . again, just be sure to order THIS one -- the one with the better price. :)",1214265600,,2190,4.8133333333333335
