8695994,2,B00RVHQNBA,"Two Mahler concertos in one package, great conducting by Paavo Jarvi. Waltraud Meier in the 3rd symphony and Genia K&uuml;hmeier in the 4th. Particularly K&uuml;hmeier surprised me, what a joy to see and hear her! Both recordings from Kloster Eberbach.
BUT...
This blu-ray is upscaled, what's the purpose of this?! I expect nothing less than FullHD resolution when buying blu-rays. This concertos offer only DVD quality. I feel cheated, indeed.
Shame on C Major!",1427673600,3,462,5.256756756756757

8695996,5,B00RVHQNBA,"A bit of background first. Since there are already many good live Mahler performances captured on dvd, I'm planning on purchasing only this one - which I've obviously already done - and the upcoming release of symphonies 7 & 8. from Paavo Jarvi's new cycle with the Frankfurt Radio Symphony Orchestra. I already own Chailly's excellent Leipzig performance of Mahler 6 on dvd, so I'm skipping Jarvi's release of symphonies 5 & 6 (I own numerous fine cd's of Mahler 5). I skipped the first release of symphonies 1 and 2 for the simple reason that I already own Jarvi's excellent CD recording of Mahler 2 on Virgin Classics. I also own Chailly's dvd of the ""Resurrection"" symphony (#2), as well as a very fine and idiomatic Mahler 1 on dvd with the Dresden Staatskapelle, conducted by Fabio Luisi (it comes a perfectly serviceable performance of Beethoven's first piano concerto). We Mahler buffs are very spoiled for choices these days. But I'm still very pleased that I picked the plain-old dvd set of Jarvi's M3/M4, for the price of what just one symphony would cost from anybody else's cycle captured on video.

The release of symphonies 1 and 2 have received some criticism - especially on BluRay - for some technical shortcomings with both the video and audio components. It is for these frequent technically glitches - along with the higher price tag - that I have kept from upgrading my classical purchases from dvd to BluRay. I just don't see the point. By using just the plain-old PCM sound option, the sound quality of both symphonies is as good as it is on ANY dvd in my collection. There's a big dynamic range and plenty of visceral impact to these performances (recorded in a very resonant church or small cathedral). Yet, the clarity of Mahler's elaborate orchestrations is all there.

As for the picture, I didn't notice anything remotely defective. Because these are being performed in an old church, the lighting employed casts a sort of sepia tone over the musician's skin - as though they all might have tanning lotion on - as well as on the instruments themselves. I suspect that many of the lights have a colored filter on them to keep from blinding the musicians. If you can accept that much, you're home free. The camera work itself, in my opinion, is extremely good. By ""camera work"", I mean the decisions of what instruments to show at any given moment, and for how long. The camera is never allowed to linger too long on any given instrument, or any Jarvi himself (who's a fascinating conductor to watch, in my opinion). In short, the camera work enhances the performance rather than being a distraction or hindrance. Now let's get down to the nitty-gritty.

Both of these performances are very intelligently conducted and superbly performed. The strong resonance of the acoustics in Kloster Eberbach greatly reinforce the lower end of the orchestra, which may not be to everyone's taste (it does take a bit of getting used to). But there are real advantages to that 'boomy' resonance, and it particularly assists these two symphonies at two specific spots: the end of Mahler 3 where the two sets of tympani go back and forth on the tonic and dominant notes, and at the big climax of the slow movement to Mahler 4. These are two spots where Mahler's insistent and loud tympani writing can seem a bit of a 'head scratcher'. But with the added resonance of the church, Mahler's wisdom snaps clearly into place. Yet - all that said - there's still tremendous clarity to the sound, with the Frankfurt R.S.O.'s excellent woodwinds and horns being particularly clear and starry (the horns being the stars of the show throughout). And while some may question just how competitive the Frankfurt R.S.O. could possibly be against their more illustrious colleagues in Vienna, Munich, Berlin and Amsterdam, let me assure you that their playing is confident, precise and strong throughout. After-all, they had successful recorded all of the major works of Mahler previously, in  the '80s, with Mahler specialist Eliahu Inbal for the Denon label. That cycle is still top drawer today.

What puts these two performances 'over the top' for me are the vocal soloists employed  - Waltraud Meier in M3, and Genia Kuhmeier in M4 - as well as just the sheer stillness and silence from the Frankfurt audience in both symphonies. For a moment, I was beginning to wonder if these might have been performed in North Korea, where only those who have demonstrated strong party allegiance were permitted to attend (""remain silent or you're off to the Gulag!""). Seriously, this is a huge plus in Mahler's more 'chamber-ish' moments"", as well as those points where everyone has a unison rest. Back to the vocalists.

Waltraud Meier possesses nothing close to an 'earth mother' like, Contralo-ish voice. Yet, her many years of experience as a Wagner specialist (among other things) brings just a ton of expressive flexibility to her singing in the Zarathustra song (4th movement), as well as lending plenty of support to the women's and boy's choirs in the short, 'bim-bam' fifth movement. Her track record in Mahler has been quite impressive and she delivers the goods here as well. Kuhmeier is a light voiced soprano who is nearly ideal for the finale of the fourth symphony - almost as good as Miah Persson was for Ivan Fischer (Channel Classics). She does a lovely job on her swell towards the end, followed by a masterful descending glissando to the word ""lacht"" (""Sanct Ursula selbst dazu lacht"").  I found this to be an incredibly moving performance of the fourth symphony.

Climaxes are quite impressive in both symphonies, with the church acoustics really revving up the bass drum, tympani, double basses, celli, and even tam-tam smashes. Yet, soft and chamber-ish moments possess a great amount of repose, especially under Jarvi's sensitive and judicious leadership. This set is a real keeper for me, and I greatly look forward to the release of symphonies 7 & 8 (M8 will be back in their normal concert hall).",1425859200,9,6013,4.847127555988315
