8255431,3,B0014EVZIW,"""Historic Pesticide and Crop Dusting Films"" archived by Quality Information Publishers (c2007) preserves three agricultural pesticide application films.

Dow Chemical's ""Death to Weeds"" (1947, 22 minutes) reflects the atmosphere of the time that ""weeds are nature's outlaws.""  This film touts contemporary Dow research on four early herbicides, including 2-4-D and Esteron 44.  The appropriate dust or spray is shown for various crops: wheat, rice, peas, sugar cane and golf courses.  Pests include mesquite, bindweed, bitterweed, indigo, water hyacinth, and poison ivy. By modern standards, the resolution is fuzzy but the best that can be done for film-to-DVD transfer.  The atmosphere of the time comes through, where farmers suffer heavy losses due to invasive weeds, and the responsibility for solving the problem is left to individual farmers. Virtually no personal protective equipment is worn at this time. The film begins and ends with a quaint manifesto proclaiming why ""death to weeds"" is important.

""Agricultural Aviation"" (1955, 13 minutes) is nearly a decade later and reflects more modern research. Biplanes are heavily featured along with the USDA ARS role in research in aerial pesticide application: spray technology, measurement of pesticide application and dispersal, and airplane design.  Both the bollworm and boll weevil problems are illustrated; spray of cotton includes use of defoliants for easier mechanical harvesting. Helicopters are shown, but they note the higher cost.  The applications of fruit regulation chemicals to hold apples on the tree until harvesting involves 2-4-5-TP.  The ""success of DDT"" is mentioned. [This was well before the problems with bird egg shells were recognized.  Indeed, the expansion of DDT from indoor mosquito control to widespread outdoor application was a major reason for the generation of insect resistance to DDT...see the Desowitz book, ""The Malaria Capers.""] Spraying of tobacco is shown, noting the broad collateral effect of insecticide. For economy, nearby landing strips are needed to refill the biplanes. Booster sprays can be used for top dressing. Pre-emergent sprays were available for weeds. 2-4-D damages peas so it is important to control vapor drift to such adjacent fields.

""Who Shall Reap?"" (1969, 28 minutes) is a decade later and more wide ranging, with many views of farming in third world countries and stressing the high loss of crops to insect pests. Footage includes very brief clips of the North African migratory locust, tsetse fly, North American screwworm, other insect pests and weeds. At that time there were 3  billion people in the world, with 6 billion predicted by 2000. Ticks, houseflies, nematodes, rats are also pictured. In the U.S. at this time, insects take one-fourth of all wheat.  By now, testing of chemicals for environmental effects is being stressed as well as personal protective equipment and general safety in the environment. A gas chromatograph has not changed much. ""Cultural control"" measures are mentioned including sterile release of the Mexican fruit fly, use of UV black lights, pheromone traps, and beneficial insect introduction (wasp-aphid).  Rust and smut damage are shown.  European corn borers eat up to half of a crop, addressed by breeding of resistant plant varieties.  Integrated pest management is discussed, ending with a paean to man's ""superiority over every other form of life.""
