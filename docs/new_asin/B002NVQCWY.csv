8375469,5,B002NVQCWY,This is an excellent DVD for beginning quilters who want to learn how to add several types of borders and bindings to their quilt tops. It's also a good review for more experienced quilters. Learning from Paula's DVD is like having your own personal teacher in your home. I highly recommend it.,1274140800,2,294,4.673076923076923
