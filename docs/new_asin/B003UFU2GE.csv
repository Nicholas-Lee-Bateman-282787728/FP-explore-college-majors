8405960,1,B003UFU2GE,For those of us not understanding PAL format...and it not being viewable in the USA...feel warning should have been given when order placed. It not only ruined a birthday gift for my spouse...but am out $40!!!! Once opened cannot be returned....did not know it wouldn't work till placed in DVD player...............shame on Amazon!!!!,1370736000,2,334,5.320754716981132
8405961,3,B003UFU2GE,"This is a great DVD, except that there are no English subtitles.  There is much dialogue and some comical moments, but if you do not know the dutch language, you have to just wait until the music starts again.  Very disappointing considering that in all the other Andre Rieu DVDs, Andre either speaks English or there are English subtitles so that you know what he is talking about in between the musical pieces.",1293926400,7,412,4.63013698630137
8405962,4,B003UFU2GE,"I was very pleased with the DVD.  I'm glad you had it, for I could not obtain it elsewhere.  The DVD arrived well before expected.  Thank-you",1284768000,6,141,4.346153846153846
