8017421,3,B0001WTVMK,"Though I will always recognize PM Entertainment and director Joseph Merhi for being the main producers of karate B-movies from the 1990s, a flick like ""Zero Tolerance"" reminds me that they were in fact more versatile when it came to the action department. Disappointingly, it could be much better. This is an ambitious but ultimately mild shoot-em-up picture that foolishly takes a ""less is more"" approach when it should've embraced excess. Particular fans of Robert ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/T-1000/dp/B001VLBDD0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">T-1000</a>"" Patrick may apply.

The story: When his family is murdered and his own life endangered by a powerful drug cartel, an FBI agent (Patrick) becomes a vigilante deadest on revenge.

As much as I like ol' Joe Merhi, I wish that a more inventive director had brought greater life to the plot. PM regularly made films that were a lick or two above the dramatic average, but here, it unsuccessfully attempts to navigate a precisely-balanced screenplay. John Flynn or Andrew Davis might've taken the screenplay and coordinated it into an escalating action-thriller, whereas Merhi bloats the first half of the picture with plot while skimping on action before reversing the formula for the second half. It's a competent film, but the dramatic scenes are awkwardly-placed and actors underwhelming in their performances.

Action-wise, the movie does well enough but could achieve more. Much to my surprise, there was a smattering of fight scenes, though none of them particularly stood out. The highlights are several exhibitions of bullet ballet, clearly modeled after John Woo's output. Viewed in a vacuum, the handful of large-scale shootouts is furious and entertaining. However, other films have had better results in westernizing the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hard-Boiled/dp/B0041SI7AC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hard Boiled</a>&nbsp;standard:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nemesis/dp/6305232679/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nemesis</a>&nbsp;and even&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hard-Justice/dp/6303945708/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hard Justice</a>&nbsp;are both relatively cheap films that did a better job of aping Woo's style and improvising with the resources they had. ""Zero Tolerance"" features occasionally cool stuntwork and a handful of unique guns, but I've seen much better.

Strong production values are balanced out by a surprisingly grim tone, making this an interesting action flick to watch but not necessarily a fun one. I declare it to be on the low side of average: worth catching on TV, maybe worth renting, but probably not worthy of purchase.",1435795200,,2795,6.485254691689008

8017423,1,B0001WTVMK,"When FBI agent Jeff Douglas (Robert Patrick) journeys by automobile, along with two other operatives from his Los Angeles office, to fictional ""La Ropa"", Mexico, to assume custody of an American narcotics dealer incarcerated there, there is no cause for him to expect other than completion of a routine assignment, while looking ahead to a pleasantly familial evening at home with his wife and two children.  However, the drug boss, whimsically named Ray Manta (Titus Welliver), is forcefully removed from the clutches of The Law by a large cluster of motorcycle riding desperadoes who capture Douglas and kill his two comrades.  His life threatened by the daring rescue that has thwarted the Bureau detail, Jeff is impelled to undertake a galling task.  After speaking with his wife by telephone, Douglas is promised by the villains that he will be freed if he will feign at ushering Manta toward FBI custody, whereas in actuality he will be delivering the felon to Las Vegas and into the company of the other four ringleaders of a cabal that calls itself The White Hand, and that has gained what amounts to primary control of liquid heroin trafficking within the United States.  Jeff eludes his captors and after he has telephonically learned that his entire family has been slain by minions of The White Hand, Douglas commences upon a mission of retribution, his goal to assassinate the five criminal organization kingpins, including Manta.  Therefore, the background has been properly established for an interesting tale of heated vengeance.  Unfortunately, the narrative is composed for the most part of set pieces that utilize a large contingent of stunt men and demolition experts, to the detriment of the plotline.  It seems that gunmen hired by The White Hand are selected largely upon their proven substandard marksmanship, with scene following risible scene depicting a fortunate Douglas being unharmed by numberless rounds fired at close range by numberless thugs, after which he predictably brings down one each per trigger pull.  Plainly, if Jeff were in fact gunned down, the film would be at its end, this truth eliminating any possible creation of suspense.  Additionally, when a viewer finds himself chortling at what are ostensibly harrowing circumstances for the hero, it becomes obvious that this production suffers from a shortfall of logic.  There is scant opportunity for the display of acting chops here, although Patrick gamely tries to create his role, while playing honours go to Welliver for his consistently effective portrayal of a principal member of the Forces of Evil.",1189468800,,2602,5.173809523809524
8017424,5,B0001WTVMK,"Once in a great while, a certain will fall through the cracks for years and years until finally it will be discovered for its inherint greatness. Zero Tolerance is just such a movie. From the opening body-bag limit breaking shootout, to the exciting finale, this movie delivers, and does so with an exploding shotgun.
T1000 plays Zero Tolerance (I forgot his real name... It really isn't even important), A man whose had enough of heroin cartels killing his family, and trying to kill him. So he does what any man who up until 5 seconds ago was a cop would do. He loads up for some double-barreled action, systematically taking down each of the 5 members of The White Hand. The Hand may have an army of goons, a vast array of high powered assault rifles, and enough heroin to kill mick jagger, but the one thing that they don't have, are Zeros magic handguns which have the stopping power of a runaway train, and the accuracy of the worlds finest sniper rifles. Combined with his shotgun that is constantly loaded with grenade rounds, there isn't a heroin dealer left standing by the time Zero gets through with things
In conclusion, this isn't a movie you should watch. It is a lifestyle you should strive to achieve.
Thankyou, Zero Tolerance",1079395200,5,1243,4.654545454545454
8017425,5,B0001WTVMK,"If you're looking for an action movie then look no further, with high-adrenaline action scenes from start to finish, Zero Tolerance is the ultimate action flick.  Robert Patrick has the starring role as FBI agent Jeff Douglas and yet again he shines. I am always amazed by the emotion he is able to put through in any character he plays and Jeff is no different, you really feel for him and what he's going through.  Watching Robert in this film is actually almost like watching a young John Doggett (his character in The X-Files), some familar mannerisms can be spotted, as well as his trademark intensity.  The supporting cast is also good, particularly Kristen Meadows as Megan, and also keep an eye out for Barbara Patrick (Robert's real-life wife) playing his wife Wendy in the film.  I must admit that I originally hired this film purely because it starred Robert, who is my favorite actor, but I enjoyed it so much that I had to purchase my own copy.  If you're a fan of Robert or just action movies in general, I highly recommend checking this one out.",1013904000,3,1060,4.617021276595745
