5709900,5,B00CAX1PTK,"I have always loved foreign films and drama series. Korean drama is one of the best in my opinion. This series is one of many that puts them on top! It has scandal, intrigue, action (a big plus for me!), romance and more. The acting is amazing and the plot completely compelling. The music is beautiful and enhances the mood of the scenes very well. A masterpiece of Asian Cinema!",1397260800,,380,4.442857142857143

5709902,5,B00CAX1PTK,"Great acting. Good subtitles. Engrossing script. MBC produced and distributed. Han Ga-In, who played the female lead in Super Rookie, won the 2012 MBC Drama Awards ""Top Excellence Award, Actress in a Miniseries"" for her role in this drama. When the final episode aired, it earned an audience share of 40 percent.",1378080000,,312,5.019230769230769
5709903,5,B00CAX1PTK,This on my top 5!  The young cast of characters were soooo good!  It was a bit hard to adjust the adult cast but they were also excellent - especially the King!  The subtitles were very good - a few spelling and grammar errors but not distracting.  Be prepared to cry buckets of tears - very emotional.  Watch it!,1372809600,2,313,4.237288135593221

5709906,5,B00CAX1PTK,"I like my Korean historical dramas from time to time, but often there is so much 'culture' being thrown at you that you have to shy away at them. This was cempelling in a way that it was a mixture of romance, politics and personal discovery. I was complete obsessed with this drama when it was on, I went to sleep thinking about it, and was on edge waiting for the next epsisode (Kim Soo Hyun absolutely beautiful face had NOTHING to do with it, I swear it). But I greatly enjoyed this drama and will be purchasing it!",1346284800,4,518,4.242424242424242
5709907,3,B00CAX1PTK,"This is a beautiful story to watch. The problem is inadequate subtitles.
 It's difficult to follow the story, when whole conversations are not translated into English. As far as the subtitles provided, they're short and don't fully explain what's happening. Am watching it any way and trying my best to piece the story together.",1483833600,2,328,5.074074074074074

5709910,4,B00CAX1PTK,"The only problem is that the translation is so poor. I saw this series originally on Dramafever and the subtitles are superior there. I would have thought that a product that was done professionally for sale would have been at least as good, but some of it barely makes any sense.",1476057600,6,280,4.509803921568627

5709918,4,B00CAX1PTK,I really enjoyed this series. The cast was great (both the younger and older selves) and the story kept me wanting to watch the next episode. I had quite a few tearing up moments while watching this. The atmosphere created by the soundtrack combined with the acting really got to me at times. Good show.,1468281600,,303,4.527272727272727
5709919,5,B00CAX1PTK,"I absolutely love this show!! I am a big fan of Kdrama and the fact that Jeong Il-Woo, Kim Soo-Hyun and  Yeo Jin-Goo are all in this show makes it even better. Jin Goo plays the young prince who is stuck in the world of cut throat politics and the cookie cutter image of what it means to be ""The Prince"". As always, Jin Goo plays his rolls with suck passion and you cant help but laugh and cry with him.

Without giving away too many details, this follows the story of two princes. 1. the legitimate son and 2. the illegitimate son. Both boys get along with one another, but because of politics the illegitimate son lives outside the palace and away from his brother who worships him. As an unfortunate turn of evens, both boys manage to fall in love with the same girl, but because the legitimate prince has the backing of the King, he is betrothed to the girl. The councilors to the Kings court do not like the girl and conspire to get rid of her. They have the ""Queen Mother"" enlist the help of a shaman to curse the girl to death. Of course the young girl is stuck by an unknown illness, and against the Princes wishes is banished from the Palace and dies shortly after. Because of this, both princes are now at odds with one another and no longer see one another. What you come to find out though is that the Shaman did curse the child, but she did not kill her, only putting her in a deep sleep which causes her to loose her memory. To wrap up this very long explanation... After about 5 episodes, you skip to when all the characters are now adults and the once thought to be dead princess returns to the palace. Although she does not remember anyone, the King recognizes her almost immediately even though he doubts the possibility that she could be alive. The legitimate son, (now an adult and king) has a great amount of gilt over the death of his Princess, so with the appearance of this woman who reminds him of her there is a lot of stress going around and mysteries that must be solved. There are a lot of other factors that goes into this which I will not go into, but over all this show has such a complex and awesome story. All the actors do an amazing job depicting their characters you cant help but feel their pains and joys.

So my synopsis is: Buy this show!!! you will not regret it!",1467590400,,2305,4.257990867579909

5709924,5,B00CAX1PTK,"The order arrived within a week and in fairly good condition. Although I purchased the drama for my Korean mom, I got glued to the television for weeks watching all the episodes - two times! We laughed, cried and smiled, definitely all stars to me. I liked the romantic plot (love survives!), various characters (good/bad) and the historical costumes (bright/shiny/traditional) in the story. Also, growing up in the US, I needed the English subtitles (comprehensible) in this DVD to keep up with the episodes. Then I highly recommended it to my family members who are right now enjoying it.",1461974400,7,590,4.96969696969697

5709936,5,B00CAX1PTK,"This is a really great TV series. A very beautiful story, the main female character is the best; the main male actor is not, in my opinion, a match to the female actress, but has some moments of greatness on his own.
