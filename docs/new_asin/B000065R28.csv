7961262,4,B000065R28,"Sensitive and sweet story with multiple threads that don't quite hold together. The Keitel thread had promise but petered out. The central story of the pedicab drive and the working woman is quite nice, and the two young children is also touching. Well worth watching.",1455753600,2,268,4.977777777777778
7961263,5,B000065R28,"This ONE AMAZING story!  The heroine gets her ""flower"" instead of getting ""deflowered"" yet again.  Unlikely happy ending blooming in the backwater alleys of Vietnam.  If you're tired of zombies and vampires, and go-getters getting got, the this is for you.  A realistic feel-good ending to the rather dismal 20th century.",1453680000,5,321,5.235294117647059

7961267,5,B000065R28,"I would say that I loved this movie but it's not the kind of that movie. It moves you, the stories mingle and yet share a common thread. All giving you another insight about the human  character. I thought that the way everyone from child peddler to prostitute was treated with dignity, was excellent. A must see and let it touch you because you will look at people differently after.",1121126400,3,384,4.485714285714286
7961268,5,B000065R28,This movie is so smooth and involving that You really start to feel and identify with the people in the movie. Bravo..............its proves that good acting and a beautiful story can still be done without special effects.,1078099200,,222,5.027027027027027
