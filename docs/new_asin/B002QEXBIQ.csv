8377739,2,B002QEXBIQ,My main problem with this travel documentary is that you don't know what you are seeing since it's only music and scenes.,1360454400,,121,4.545454545454546
8377740,2,B002QEXBIQ,"This IS NOT a Rick Steve's like video. Music is excellent (Mozart), but the scenery shown is a ripoff.
Examples of what was shown, repeated scenes of a horse and buggy, the driver, the horse, the horse's ass, paintings, family at a rocky beach, close up on young girl at beach, then the young boy, ambulance driving in steets of Naples (too many traffic scenes), mummified remains in museum, banyan (?) trees and tree roots, puppet show (come on, a puppet show?), more traffic,  .
Good stuff included artwork, mosaics, and sculptures in Naples museum, ocean views of Sicily, building and facades, churches, open air shopping and markets, some panoramic shots of countryside,
I expected more flyby or driveby scenery/countryside, city shots to give a flavor of the surroundings (rural and city). I consider this a rather amateurish production not worth the price.",1351814400,,862,5.027972027972028
8377741,4,B002QEXBIQ,"I liked the video imagery of the island of Sicily, Southern Italy and environs. Although I didn't recognize many of the composers and their compositions, just hearing the music and seeing these places was good enough for me.",1331942400,,224,4.921052631578948
