8437188,4,B004OEIOOC,"Buckley and Mailer duke it out over Cold War politics, social justice, moral relativism and the ethics of free expression while Vonnegut, in a noble display of statesmanship, quietly attempts to keep the conversation focused on literature and the works of PEN (of which Mailer was president at the time and ostensibly the day's central topic of discussion) on the eve of that organization's assembling in New York (1985).  As followers of the show would expect, the lesson one takes away is: be prepared for an intellectual beating when you cross WFB.  It is refreshing, however, to note how amicably each man comports himself even when the discourse gets somewhat heated and personal.  Not the best of 'Firing Line' match-ups, as Mailer's and Vonnegut's right-brain arguments tend to be an ill fit for Buckley's left, but still an engrossing watch.",1375488000,7,849,5.05
8437189,5,B004OEIOOC,"This features an entertaining debate between WFB Jr and Norman Mailer. It erupts during the discussion of the writer's organization PEN and how far they go in support of writers behind the iron curtain and whether or not they would supply benefits to authors who preach hate with their work.

Kurt Vonnegut appears with Mailer though he is on the sideline for much of the debate. At one point, Vonnegut tries to intervene to bring down the argument but Mailer tells him to not play the peacemaker. If you're looking for a healthy amount of Vonnegut in his own words, you will not find that here.

This is an enjoyable discussion regardless of where you are on the political spectrum.",1365465600,3,683,4.683333333333334
