7924670,5,B00004W45B,"Prior to watching this, I watched&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Seven-Spiritual-Laws-of-Success/dp/B000NO1XHW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success</a>&nbsp;and I was not sure if I would get anything new in this video. Considering this is twice as long, there is even more information packed into here. Deepak Chopra's 7 Spiritual Laws are:

- Pure Potentiality
- Giving and Receiving
- Karma (there is
- Least Effort
- Intention and Desire
- Detachment
- Dharma (Purpose of Life)

The first half, the Seven Laws, is actually a recording of a lecture he gave. There are some good details here that back up his other video and enhances the overall lesson.

The second half, Crystal Cave, is another recorded lecture that involves the teachings of Merlin. The teachings are valuable, and really drive home the 7 Spiritual Laws. Everyone has an inner ""Wizard"" or spirit that knows the truth about life and existence. What is necessary is for us to tap into that wizard. Just like with the other video, this is a good place to start your self-development/spiritual journey but it is not complete in and of itself. If you are interested, this will lead you to seek out more sources which I suggest you do as your journey should not entirely rely on one resource alone.",1300838400,,1337,5.327014218009479
7924671,5,B00004W45B,"I saw Dr. Chopra on a cable interview and was immediately impressed with his presence and internal calmness. I liked that he challenged my belief systems and encouraged me to think outside of my programed way of thinking.  I immediately hopped online and decided to give one of his DVDs a try.  I'm glad I did.  While I'm not totally convinced of everything he teaches I am interested in delving deeper.  I found this particular DVD enlightening and entertaining.  I found myself taking loads of notes and even watching the Crystal Cave portion more than once on the same night.  Overall, I think this DVD is definitely worth your time.",1187740800,,636,4.736363636363636
7924672,5,B00004W45B,"The above reviewers wrote great reviews I concur with wholeheartedly. Unlike ""the Flowering of Human Consciousness"" w/Eckhart Tolle, I always felt uplifted & positive about the potential of life & all the great moments in life were in spontenity, never planned & never judged or unsatisfying. Only when we force things or worry about it raining on our picnic all the time we miss the fun we had when we were kids. Yes, life can be hard at times, but never wrap yourself up in it that you don't take time to enjoy the present's gifts, even if it's a stranger's smile or joke, or watching a fun moment between parent & child...",1148774400,,625,4.539823008849558
7924673,5,B00004W45B,"Deepak Chopra's Seven Spiritual Laws of Success is not a book you read once and say, Hmmmm...good book. It's truly a way of life, of thinking and believing. His words are clear and logical, but his concepts come to be understood at a level beyond words--not as something we don't already know at some level, but as something we need to be reminded of frequently.

 He tells us that everything we wish is possible for us if we only live according to the laws of the universe, understanding that we are made up of energy, pure potentiality. He reminds us about the law of giving and receiving (which are one in the same thing), the law of intention and desire, the law of least effort (how to let the universe do the work), the law of detachment (how to let the universe show us the way to achieve our goals). He reminds us that we can find joy by asking the universe How may I serve rather than What's in it for me. His words are truly inspiring. Anyone following these laws cannot help but to become a better human being: more loving, kinder, happier.

 After reading the book, I purchased the audio version which I play each day on the way to and from work. It's a wonderful way to get my thoughts on track for the day ahead.

 Of all Deepak Chopra's works, and I've read most of them, this, to me, is the clearest and most practical. I can't recommend the book highly enough.",1090972800,8,1377,4.33852140077821

This film is totally professional and high quality photography.  The boating part of this film is 52 minutes and there is approximately 45 minutes of salt flats land speed records.  This film is worth 3 times the selling price.  If anyone is considering purchasing this film, you will not be disappointed.",967420800,,458,4.9605263157894735
