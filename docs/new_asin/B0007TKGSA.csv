ROGUES GALLERY (1944) is a no-budget Producer's Releasing Corp. programmer that's currently rated 4.9 at IMDb.

A not-very-amusing comedic whodunit, this one stars Frank Jenks in a role better-suited for Bob Hope. One scene in an auto being driven by Robin Raymond is particularly reminiscent of Mr. Hope. Passenger Jenks casually dangles his arm and encounters the cold face of a corpse lying, unbeknowst to him, on the backseat floor. Jenks' awkward doubletakes, gulps and shudders adequately convey surprise but aren't at all funny.

With as many as seven actors clustered together here, one is reminded of a Firesign Theatre quote from their album,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DON-T-CRUSH-THAT-DWARF-HAND-ME-THE-PLIERS/dp/B00005T7IS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DON'T CRUSH THAT DWARF, HAND ME THE PLIERS!</a>: ""Gather around everybody and stay on camera."" An austere prop budget translates to unconvincing sets inhabited by people who stand and sit sideways from each other, perhaps to keep their faces on-screen (?).

As for the petite Miss Raymond, her loudmouth reporter in a salad bowl hat is one-dimensional and immediately  bothersome. Leading lady material she isn't. When articles of clothing (such as her chapeau) or obviously cardboard sets hold your attention more than plot and perfomance, then you are in for one LONG hour.

2241318,3,B0007TKGSA,"Rogue's Gallery, 1944 film

The film begins in a city where a statue points to the left. The `Daily Express' is a newspaper. Two reporters failed to get a story about a new invention that allows listening to conversations from a distance. [Some kind of secret weapon?] They want to see Professor Reynolds. The lights go off, Reynolds is attacked! The police are called. There is a collision in the dark, a book is dropped. A flashbulb can blind a man. The invention to listen from a distance is revolutionary. Patsy will get a story when she returns that book. But the lights go out, there is a shot, and the plans are stolen again! They find a body outside, and call the police. Lt. Danny O'Day will investigate. But the corpse is gone! [Guess where it went. Guess what happens next.]

Professor Reynolds explains his invention that can listen to distant conversations, but it has limitations. The reporters go for an interview and find John Foster on the floor, the plans stolen. Eddie climbs into a window to see Reynolds, but he won't talk. They ask to use the phonograph. Will it reveal the killer for a surprise ending? Eddie and Patsy are sent on a new assignment.

This is basically a comedy that uses murders and reporters for a background. Its not ""The Front Page"", but an average story at best. The corpse that disappears and reappears seems incredible except for a Hollywood story. One interesting item is the reference to a similar event in Washington DC. Was this wartime propaganda to provide a cover story?",1263772800,,1522,4.6716417910447765

gags are interspersed to lighten things up a bit.
