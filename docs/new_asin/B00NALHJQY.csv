8676821,4,B00NALHJQY,"I have to admit, the main reason i bought these movies is because the girl on the cover was attractive but after i watched them, i was very glad i added these to my collection. The two movies star Pei-Pei  Cheng( The Shadow Whip and Come Drink With Me). The first movie, Kung fu Girl is the better movie of the two and has the most action. It  kinda reminds me of Bruce Lee's Fist Of Fury. It also has the best picture quality of the 2. The second movie is  Whiplash. The plot's not as good as the first one . It doesn't have as much action but it's funnier.  Pei Pei Cheng and 7 bandits are looking for her father who got lost on a treasure hunt. Both are golden harvest movies. They are in the original manderin dialog and subtitled in english. They also have the original trailers for both films.",1524528000,,799,4.1688311688311686

8676823,4,B00NALHJQY,these 2 movie's are the younger version of Cheng Pei-Pei ... so these 2 movie's was fun to watch and see her early movie work ...Whip-Lash was basically about her adventure in the mountain's with stolen treasure ...and Kungfu Girl about her showing her kungfu skill's against military corruption ...I did enjoy them ?,1456963200,,317,4.888888888888889
8676824,3,B00NALHJQY,"These films were Cheng Pei Pei's farewell to the genre. She has always been a wonder to behold onscreen, however, these are a cut below her Shaw films. GH really skimped on production values and it shows. Need an Eng language dubbed for these...",1440547200,,245,4.590909090909091
8676825,3,B00NALHJQY,"While many have heralded that discovery of the grindhouse film over the past decade the fact is that many of us were exposed to those same movies not via small unsavory locations filled with hookers and junkies but in areas as diverse as drive-ins and even television. For martial arts movie fans across the country there were countless chop socky programs offered on local and national channels that brought out the lowest priced films from both the Shaw Brothers and Golden Harvest studios. All seemed to be shot on the same sets (many were) and made with more effort spent on wire work than on story.

But those weren't the only films being made in China at the time. Others dealt more with story that was deep and involved history as well as legends of old. The problem was that those films definitely lost much in translation, sometimes literally and at other times due to the difference in societies. How could European based countries relate to the struggles of peasants over emperors and corrupt governments officials? And yet we tried to absorb these stories and enjoy them. For most it was less about the story and more about the whole phenomena of kung fu battles.

Which brings me around to the release of this double feature from Shout Factory. Martial arts aficionados will no doubt recognize the star of both KUNG FU GIRL and WHIPLASH, Pei-Pei Cheng. She was one of the shining lights of the genre in China. So much so that when director Ang Lee made CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON he chose her to play one of the lead roles. But while her name may be synonymous with the genre in China my guess is that few here know her. That can change thanks to DVDs being released, starting with this disc.

The stories here differ from one another. GIRL takes place in the Chinese Republic where a ruthless general decides to take over the country and proclaim himself emperor. Student activists (though while watching I just thought they were peasant bandits, an example of the lost in translation I spoke of) strike out against him. Cheng stars as a young woman who impersonates the long lost sister whose brother has been arrested in the hopes of getting close to the new emperors chief of security. This one features a much deeper plot than one usually expects from the typical martial arts flick and will requires more attention than one would expect from the genre we grew up with.

The second film, WHIPLASH, plays more for combination of comedy and action. The movie opens with a group that heads to the mountains in the hope of finding a long lost treasure, but they run into problems. Cut to the home of Cheng which is set upon by a group of bandits. She takes on each one with a combination of martial arts and her bullwhip. One of the bandits was in possession of several of her fathers belongings and when questioned told her he was wounded in a ravine. Eventually she serves them wine till they are drunk, then ties them up and recruits them to assist her in finding her father, the man who led the group seen at the films opening. Along the way there is plenty of action, a little intrigue and lots of laughs from the various members of the bandits, most notably their always referring back to getting drunk.

One thing you notice when looking back at films like these is the speed, or lack thereof, on display during the action sequences. In a time now where we see lightning speed used in movies that feature both hand to hand combat as well as martial arts, these movies seem as if they are running in slow motion. But the reality of it is that this was the norm in those days. Accurate strikes, blows and responses were done protecting those involved in making the films while at the same time looking like fast paced action for the time. I think the only martial arts movies that seemed slower were any involving David Carradine. But they were so well choreographed that no one paid attention. All of that changed with the appearance of Bruce Lee.

But if you remember those films fondly, if you want to begin a collection of martial arts films that covers the genre from start to finish, then this wouldnt be a bad place to start. It offers up one of the main stars of those films in two movies for the price of one. Note that neither is dubbed but die hards won't care. For them its the love of the original films and not the westernization of them.",1431043200,3,4374,4.530379746835443
8676826,5,B00NALHJQY,"Shout! Factory has been doing a noble job cleaning up and releasing 1970s Golden Harvest martial arts movies, many for the first time in the US. I want to express my appreciation to Shout! for releasing these treasures. It seems they are one of the last companies left still willing to release classic martial arts films. I'd like to see Shout! obtain the rights from Dragon Dynasty for the classic Shaw Brothers films that DD are still sitting on. That would be EPIC!

This new Martial Arts Double Feature includes Kung Fu Girl (1973) and Whiplash (1974) which both star Cheng Pei-Pei. Cheng Pei-Pei is probably best known to the casual American moviegoer for her performance in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon but her acting career goes back to 1964. Her big breakout was in 1966 with the classic Shaw Brothers Wuxia film Come Drink With Me. She made over 20 movies for Shaw Brothers before parting ways in 1971. Her final film with SB was Lady Hermit which is a favorite of mine. The two films on this collection were made for Golden Harvest right after leaving Shaw Brothers and were to be her last two films until All The Kings Men in 1983.

Kung Fu Girl
In the US, this film is known as Kung Fu Girl, Attack of the Kung Fu Girls, and/or The Heroine. I'm not sure why Shout! didn't just use the proper title of the film None But The Brave. It is worth noting this is the complete international print that runs 119 minutes and not any of the US edits. This is a welcome addition to my collection as this is the first time this version has been released in the US.

Whiplash
Whiplash isn't quite as good as Kung Fu Girl but it is a fun film. When I say fun, I mean it is really out there but I found it entertaining.

Video: The movies are presented in 2:35 anamorphic widescreen transfers. Lets just say the transfer is not pristine as the Shaw Brothers films Dragon Dynasty released. Golden Harvest's production values were much lower than SB and I think they did not take the same care SB did in preserving their prints. There is some dirt and print damage but the films are watchable.

Audio: Both movies have a Mandarin Digital 2.0 Mono mix that is clear sounding and I have no complaints.

Subtitles: There are English subtitles.

Extras: A trailer for each film.",1426809600,8,2271,4.4842615012106535
