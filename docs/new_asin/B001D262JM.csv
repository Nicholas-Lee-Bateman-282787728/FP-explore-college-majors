3522893,5,B001D262JM,"One of the pleasant parts of the film is that traditional good guys and villains are continually switched around as the film progresses. The movie is flawed in small parts, but I don't feel that that makes it any less enjoyable, just marks points that could be improved. Basically, BROTHERHOOD OF BLOOD drips atmosphere, and sinks you into its world of shadows and blood. It's actually more of a mystery story than a horror story, and gels both genres together well. Watchable",1222646400,16,476,4.817073170731708
3522894,5,B001D262JM,"I expected this to be a lot scarier. Apart from Ken Forree's talk of tearing people's faces off, this wasn't really that unsettling. I expected more. More action, more blood, more special effects. But then I thought...why? Those elements usually overshadow the story and acting which are the strongpoints of this movie. Vampire movies are the easiest kinds of horror movies to attend. We know all the rules and we know the scenerio. But it's what the director does with those two conventions that determine the film's success. Brotherhood Of Blood is not so much a movie about vampirism as it is a movie about evil and hate. The ending, well...what can I say? Predictable, sure. But still impressive. I enjoyed the plot twists.",1222560000,8,727,4.870967741935484
3522895,5,B001D262JM,"""Brotherhood of Blood"" is maybe not a great film, but it is truly some kind of classic and I love it! And I am in no way a fan of horror movies or even a lot of gore but somehow I fell in love with this movie. I had originally decided to see it because I'm a huge fan of Victoria Pratt and had read about her performance in this film. I had read some reviews for this film and some of them were not so great. But I decided to see this movie anyway. I ended up liking it and it wasn't as gory as I had read. Now, I will admit that it is a little campy at times and some of the special effects are a little cheesy but this is just a fun film to watch. A low-budget vampire story that is much different than most films.",1222560000,16,716,3.748344370860927
3522896,5,B001D262JM,"I enjoyed ""Brotherhood of Blood"". it really is an adult film. It was a pleasant experience which starred some of the characters from my favorite horror movies. The acting in was good. That's a splendid treat for any horror movie. Not only does it have good actors, it also includes character development which also makes for a wonderful experience. Still this movie has a few flaws. But for his kind of low budget I still liked the movie, and give it a 5 out of 5 stars.",1222560000,14,470,4.413793103448276
3522897,5,B001D262JM,"When I began watching this, I had no idea what it was about. It started slow, and just as I was about to turn it off, it became intereseting. I soon became engrossed, especially with the characters.
I originally was afraid this would turn out to be a standard Vamp movie, but this one was way different. It was a well-done movie - very low budget - but a good musical score accompanied by some good acting. (for that genre, anyway) I'd highly recommend this movie to those who really don't like the same old vampire movies. It was refreshing to watch.",1222560000,9,551,4.411764705882353
3522898,4,B001D262JM,"I was at a friend's house, and he decided to put this movie on. Most of the movies he has put on in the past haven't excited me very much, so I was very critical from the start. However, Brotherhood of Blood proved to be quite watchable, and I wouldn't mind watching it again. Great suspense, great mystery; is the glass half empty or half full, perhaps there may be no glass at all. It offers originality to its genre.",1222473600,11,419,4.25

8291350,4,B001D262JM,"Good quality, great service and a nice addition. Love this item and enjoyed watching the move. I am a great fan of Sid Haig. Howeer, this could have been a little more a Dracula type movie. A slight letdown. Seller was great and loved buying from them. 100% satisfied.",1364860800,,268,4.489795918367347
8291351,1,B001D262JM,"Occasionally I see a film that I never want to see again. Something that I don't feel comfortable selling at the yard sale for a buck. Something that I want to warn others about. This is one of those films. Poorly plotted and produced, not the least bit frightening, with characters you won't remember, let alone care much about. Visit the rottentomatoes website if you want to know the truth: this film is a stinker. I laughed out loud when our band of ""heroes"" decides to torture a wimpy, overweight vampire...by pulling out his fangs! So I laughed once. Mostly, this confused, incoherent, low-budget trash elicits yawns and ultimately disgust, when you realize that you've been taken. The best Ghost House Underground film -- by a mile -- is still ""Dance of the Dead."" Seek it out, it's a treat. This one's just a pathetic trick.",1336262400,,832,4.705479452054795
8291352,2,B001D262JM,"The movie itself is horrible. Being one listed under blood and gore, it hardly consisted of any good graphics. It's like a bad B-movie. Victoria Pratt's character, being the heroine, is also one of those annoying, ""perfect"", main characters. She kicks ass and shows little to no flaw, which makes the plot itself rather boring. Not to mention that the plot was rather scattered.

Overall, the film was a waste of time for me. And the fangs? Come on. Trick-or-treaters had better ones that those in the movie!",1271548800,3,508,4.7727272727272725
8291353,2,B001D262JM,"First, I want to start out by saying that I was attracted to this flick because Sid Haig and Ken Foree were in it.  The cover art reminded me of From Dusk til Dawn and I figured with these horror icons in the film that it couldn't be that bad.

I was unfortunately unpleasantly surprised.  This is not shot on film but on Digital Video, that's not always bad if it's done right.

The story revolves around a vampire group that is trying to fight very evil forces from the past.  The story slowly comes together throughout the 80 minute running time with lots of flashbacks.  The majority of the main story is told through paintings and dialogue, there is nothing really seen in live action due to the low budget of this production.

Pro's:
Ok Acting
Good Audio (except for when the actors have to talk through overly large incisors, I mean these things are the size of pool chalk that you use for pool sticks)
Ok Story

Con's:
Poor camerawork
Amateur Special Effects (can't even call them effects really, I mean orange blood?)
3 sets total throughout the movie
Open ended ending
Picture Quality was obviously not film, fuzzy in some places

This reminded me of Dark Shadows but slower and less action in it.  People literally just stand around and talk.  There are no bats and the only time we really see a special effect it's towards the end when we see a vampire dissolve in a CGI stoked fire.

This is not the worst thing I've ever seen but it's very hard to recommend except for the vampire collectors that just have to have every vampire flick.

View at your own risk but my copy is going back to the store where I found it.",1252627200,5,1629,4.408026755852843
8291354,5,B001D262JM,"This film is basically a dark, sophisticated 'caper' thriller with the added twist that the main characters are rapidly awakened to the fact that they are being ruthlessly manipulated behind the scenes. The movie has a great cast and good scenes. It uses flashbacks in a manner similar to Memento. The actors make it fun to watch, and the in the last quarter of the movie the twist begins kicking in.",1226188800,3,400,4.647887323943662
8291355,4,B001D262JM,"BROTHERHOOD OF BLOOD is two movies in one. Enjoyable the first time you watch it, even more enjoyable the second time round. The first viewing asks questions that are answered in the final few minutes, and the second viewing is interesting because when you know the answers, the film becomes that much clearer. It requires a certain amount of commitment, though. If you like flash and bikinis and breath-taking camera angles, you won't find them here. Brotherhood is not an ""epic,"" and it doesn't pretend to be. I give it a 4 out of 5 stars.",1224720000,2,541,4.645833333333333
8291356,2,B001D262JM,"With Sam Raimi's production company Ghost House teaming up with Lion's Gate and releasing a series of what seem to be fairly decent horror films to DVD, expectations were a little bit high for me with Brotherhood of Blood, especially considering a number of good things said about this flick.  Well, sadly, Brotherhood of Blood ends up coming off as a sadly lame vampire flick with its fatal flaw being it's own production values and ultra-hammy acting.  Victoria Pratt (Mutant X, Cleopatra 2525) stars as a captured vampire hunter looking to take out a guy who is well on his way to becoming an uber-vamp.  Or something.  Such things as plot and storyline get lost in the haze, as Brotherhood of Blood ends up being more confusing and non-sensical than anything else.  Genre greats and Devil's Rejects co-stars Ken Foree (who looks like he's dressed up in a pirate outfit) and Sid Haig are here, and both ham it up as much as they can with their ridiculously bad plastic vampire fangs in tow.  Still, there is a little bit to admire with Brotherhood of Blood, as co-writers/directors Michael Roesch and Peter Scheerer at least try to inject somekind of life into a tired and worn genre.  All in all, Brotherhood of Blood is worth a look if you're a vampire fanatic, but for everyone else, it proves surprisingly lame.  Then again, with a special thanks to Uwe Boll, what else should you expect here?",1224201600,5,1400,4.685714285714286
8291357,3,B001D262JM,"It's a vampire movie, and as a rule, I don't watch 'em. (OK, Hammer Draculas, but they're something else entirely.) I suppose I just should have gone with my instincts and put BROTHERHOOD OF BLOOD back on the shelf. But, I got hooked on the box copy - it looked kinda indie, the quotes were promising, and the art was gruesome enough - I thought it might be a big make-up FX film. Instead it is a low budget movie. The acting is very good and the story gets more and more dramatic and some scenes are really good. It's not a bad movie, but as far as horror movies go I was fairly impressed by BROTHERHOOD OF BLOOD and would certainly recommend it to anyone with a passing interest in horror movies, though it's probably a bit too violent and morbid for some tastes.",1222646400,7,765,4.2827586206896555
