3923042,5,B002FLOTPE,"This Showtime television drama ran between 2006 and 2008.  The series compares favorably with the HBO dramas, ""The Wire"" and ""The Sopranos"", in writing, direction and acting.  It interrelates the operation of the mob and government through the lives of two brothers, one a brutal Irish mob figure, and the other a conflicted State Representative in Providence, RI.
  The characters are well drawn, the acting--particularly from the main characters--is extraordinary, and the story is absorbing throughout the three seasons.  The moral dilemmas and human frailty portrayed are thought provoking.
  My only complaint is a technical one.  The DVDs skipped often during the credits, giving me little opportunity to review the actors and crew.",1266451200,3,738,5.469026548672566
3923043,5,B002FLOTPE,"This is an incredible series - I don't know why I never knew of it when it was actually airing!  The characters are sometimes heinous, sometimes wonderful, the story line is fantastic with two brothers (one good(?), one evil(?)) faced off against each other.  The whole family is full of difficult, but compelling people, who get under your skin, despite their flaws.  My only complaint about this series is that it only lasted 30 episodes.  I wish they would bring it back - I would tell all my friends to watch it.",1265587200,2,516,4.576086956521739
3923044,5,B002FLOTPE,"I had previously rented the entire pack, since I do not have the cable station it played on.  I loved it.  We all have dysfunctional families but I think this is my vote for the top ten (Six Feet Under might be number one).  I purchased the entire pack to give to my son for Xmas. I hope he likes it as much as I did.",1260835200,2,317,3.772727272727273
3923045,5,B002FLOTPE,"Well written and beautifully acted: Brotherhood is a solid drama. I don't know why I don't hear more about it.  Annabeth Gish is brilliant in the series (I think she's the best thing in a very good show) but, in my opinion, somewhat underused.  I know it's supposed to be about 'brotherhood' so obviously it's male oriented but the community and the families are a huge part of the show and the writers could have given Gish way more than they do.  In missing out Eileen's confession to her husband by leaving it as an inter-season occurence (seasons 1 to 2), I felt the writers did not only the actors a total disservice but also me as a viewer who had been watching the entire first series build to that very moment.  I watched the second season opener with such anticipation for that scene and was sorely disappointed that it was left to the imagination.  Ah well, I will continue to watch it as I find it very enjoyable - they build tension very well and the characters are constructed and portrayed so that you care about them very quickly.  Is it wrong that I prefer the gangster brother to the politician?

The triple-pack is better value than getting all three separately too, I found...",1258761600,4,1195,4.530232558139535
3923046,5,B002FLOTPE,"I caught unto this series via the Dexter box sets we purchased at a local Target store (series 1 & 2 which were on sale). Included with each was a complete 2-episode teaser from season 1 & 2 from the Brotherhood.  Needless to say, we had to have the Dexter Season 3 and now wait anxiousily for Season 4-Dexter! The fact of the matter is I got hooked on the Brotherhood series thru Dexter and I am now waiting for it to arrive in the mail!  This show is so great and no, it's not an Irish Sopranos!!! It's terriffic!!! Showtime was real smart to throw in teasers like this; especially for folks like myself  who do not subscribe to Showtime (the new HBO). Keep up the good work Showtime!!! You got me to purchase the entire set of the Brotherhood in one swoop!",1258502400,7,759,4.256944444444445
3923047,5,B002FLOTPE,"Though, sadly, it ended after only 3 seasons, Showtime's ""Brotherhood"" was a
well-written, well-acted series about conflicts within an Irish-American
family based in Rhode Island who has ties that extend on both sides
of the law, and ultimately of wrong & right.
Part Irish mob drama and part cop / city political intrigue drama,
""Brotherhood"" covered a lot of ground during it's short run and did
it in such a way that was easy to follow.
For some reason, it just couldn't find a huge audience like HBO's SOPRANOS
did and it was cancelled earlier this year.
However, this is a great box-set of all 3 seasons for a decent price
to have this in your collection for those days when there's absolutely
nothing on the over 125 channels that you already have!--Good stuff.",1257465600,20,767,4.731343283582089

3923151,5,B002FLOTPE,I bought the entire series based on Amazon reviews. When I began to watch it I thought that I had made a mistake with this purchase. I didn't. The series slowly sucks you in until you realize that you can't stop watching. Politicians and criminals are cut from the same cloth. Both only care about themselves as this series well shows.,1431907200,,335,4.508196721311475

3923189,5,B002FLOTPE,"Brotherhood makes you uncomfortable.  It walks you through the world of cheats and crooks including politicians, cops, roving wives, fueding family members and preditory gangsters.  The show makes you wonder if anyone is honest and whether an honest person can remain so for very long.  The performances are intense: they make the viewer uncomfortable and it's altogether too easy to get sucked into their world.  I rated the program as a five but I understand why the program wasn't a commercial success.  People crave comfort and security but in the world of Brotherhood, there's no place to hide.",1400630400,,599,5.071428571428571
3923190,5,B002FLOTPE,Loved it!  Great story line!  I never heard of it til one of my kids sent me it for Christmas - too bad it ended - like so many good serials!,1390780800,,141,3.5161290322580645
3923191,4,B002FLOTPE,Story was entertaining and engrossing. Could have continued for several more seasons. It is a winner of the first order.,1386806400,,120,5.05
3923192,3,B002FLOTPE,"Given the cast and the potential, the weak script and predictability rendered this a lacklustre experience.

3923193,5,B002FLOTPE,"I'm  fan of the gangster genre. I own everything from the classics films like The Godfather, Goodfellas, Casino, etc, to the obscure like Chicago Overcoat and This Thing Of Ours. The Sopranos, Boardwalk Empire, you name it, ive got it. So when I heard of a gangster series Id never seen before, one losely based on a local legend, Boston's own Whitey Bulger, I was interested. I ordered all 3 seasons next day  after failing to find any of them in local stores, and was not dissapointed. Fantastic writing, acting, everything. The series is a little dark, and season 3 has a somewhat rushed feeling (due to the series being canceled), but they managed to wrap everything up pretty well and give it some closure; far more than The Sopranos did. Its sad this series never caught on, it could have gone another few seasons.",1379808000,2,820,4.6482758620689655
3923194,5,B002FLOTPE,"got this complete series of Brotherhood because I had seen parts of it years ago on Showtime and wanted to see all 3 years together.  Fantastic show, very underrated, you don't hear about it much.  Gets pretty dark, but very well written and acted, similar to an Irish Sopranos, highly recommended.",1370131200,,298,4.823529411764706

3923197,5,B002FLOTPE,This was a good series-I wish they hadn't cancelled it. I have watched this over again at least 3 times and I see more everytime I see it. This came new and within the time frame for ordering.,1350518400,,192,4.078947368421052
3923234,5,B002FLOTPE,"This Showtime production is so involving and realistic. What intrigues me most about this show is the relationship between the two brothers,Jason Isaacs and Jason Clarke. One brother is in public office and the other is a criminal and how their lives intertwine and how at times they seem to switch up their morals. A must see!!!!",1346889600,,330,4.807017543859649
3923235,5,B002FLOTPE,"this show was not made for abc family. the language, violence and adult content are on par with every other major cable network show (if you find it offensive, here's a word of advice: do not watch deadwood, it will permanently scar you). sure, brotherhood can be vulgar, but i didn't think it was gratuitous. the storylines are well thought out and the acting is phenomenal! jason isaacs and jason clarke (who are english and australian, respectively) pull of the most accurate rhode island accents i've ever seen on television, on top of handling their complicated characters with ease. ethan embry and annabeth gish were fantastic! stick with it, it gets better with each season. so sad they stopped making it :(",1332720000,,715,4.868852459016393
3923236,5,B002FLOTPE,"I loved it It can be Brutal  not for the faint of heart.  Its a much more grittier version of the Soprano's  and i suspect pretty accurate. Some outstanding performances well worth it  Def some award winning acting  in there  The wife ,the grandmother, Michael and of course Tommy the good son :)  Actually i think ill watch it again tonight been awhile :)",1324857600,,356,4.46875

3923240,5,B002FLOTPE,I purchased this set mainly for my husband and found I can't stay away from it. We are nearing the end of the series and have thoroughly enjoyed it -  already sharing it with friends. Much like the Soprano series and definitely R-rated but enjoyable. And worth the investment.,1284768000,2,276,4.63265306122449
3923241,1,B002FLOTPE,"WARNING!!

Like so many shows these days, the series ended abruptly without bothering to ""end"" the series.
The networks have done that for years, and the Premium Channels have begun the same practice.
It's a disgusting attitude of showing no responsibility towards loyal viewership.
Don't buy this product! Don't reward this indifference to viewers.

If amazon permitted, I would rate it ZERO STARS regardless of the quality of the programming.
Choosing to end a show's production in the middle of it without producing a series closing is
reprehensible and should not be rewarded.",1281916800,4,580,5.225806451612903
3923242,5,B002FLOTPE,brotherhood is an interesting and entertaining series from the very first show to the last episode. i only wish it had run for more than 3 seasons.,1269734400,,147,4.481481481481482
3923243,4,B002FLOTPE,"This series, whether acknowledged or not, was inspired by the Bulger brothers of Boston, whose story is detailed in a number of books, among them ""Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob"" by Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill. James ""Whitey"" Bulger, a brutal career criminal, rose to control the Irish mob in Boston while his brother Billy rose to be the kingpin of Massachusetts politics. As an FBI informant, James Bulger cannily exploited the FBI's tunnel-vision focus on the Boston mafia to the point his FBI handler, whose roots, like Bulger's, were in South Boston, sabotaged efforts by the State Police to bring Bulger down. Alerted by his FBI handler that indictments against him were coming down, Bulger disappeared in 1995. Despite a spot on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List and a $2-million reward, he remains at large. (In 2002 Bulger's FBI handler was sentenced to 10 years for racketeering.)

Here, the setting is shifted from Boston to Providence, RI, and while there are alterations and embellishments in the name of dramatic license, the major elements of the Bulger brothers' story remain in Tommy Caffee's ascendance in the State Legislature; in Michael Caffee's wresting control of the local Irish mob and in his relationship with the local mafia family; in the FBI's arrogance and single-minded pursuit of the mafia; in the fierce tribalism of the Irish community; in the series' denouement.

I found none of the characters particularly likeable or sympathetic. That is not, however, a reflection on the acting, which is uniformly top-notch, it's just the nature of the story. (The one quibble I have is that the facial features of the actors playing the Caffee brothers are so disparate that not even fine acting convinced me they were brothers.) Though neither the story nor the characters are as rich as those of The Wire or The Sopranos, this series is one worth owning.

Update: Whitey Bulger and his girl friend Catherine Greig were arrested in Santa Monica, California, in June 2011. While the mystery of Bulger's whereabouts has been solved, the mystery of how he and Greig eluded authorities for 16 years has not, as of this note. That story, or what passes for it (my money is on the full truth never coming out), will be fodder for books, certainly, and perhaps a movie or mini-series.",1269043200,8,2352,4.889724310776942
