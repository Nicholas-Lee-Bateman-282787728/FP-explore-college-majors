8173189,1,B000MWCMDY,I had seen a 8 episode series of his diaries on Netflix and thought this was it. What I got was 50 minutes narrated by Peter Coyote. If you are expecting just Timothy in this show you will get very little of his narration. I am still looking for the longer 8 episode one where it is Timothy who narrates. If anyone knows what this is called or where to get it please let me know.,1491609600,6,379,4.0
8173190,5,B000MWCMDY,"I've bought and read all I could find on Timothy Treadwell (I was a guide guiding bearviewing in the very same places he camped - which BTW means he would have hated me ... that's ok, I respect and admire him nonetheless). You might not like it as much if the subject doesn't involve you as much.",1415145600,,296,4.2105263157894735
8173191,4,B000MWCMDY,"I got this DVD because I thought it was the Grizzly Man Diaries that had been on TV some years ago. It is the same Timothy Treadwell but this is not the series that had been on TV.
The footage is real and from him but at the beginning of his living with the bears not the same years as was portrayed in the series.
Still very good but not actual series if that is what you think you are buying.",1388707200,7,394,3.876543209876543
8173192,5,B000MWCMDY,"This series is brilliant. TT lived several months each year alone in a tent unarmed for more than a decade in prime bear country in the Alaskan wilderness. One day, probably too late, we will drop our hardened exteriors and try to really love our fellow creatures as many of us instinctively did as children.  To me TT is a Gandhi of what is euphemistically called the environmental movement, which is nothing else but the slow demise of the human race because we are species-centric, loving first family, then country, then humans.  This sounds great and wholesome, which is exactly why it will be the poison that surreptitiously  destroys us all.",1255910400,8,648,4.81981981981982
8173193,2,B000MWCMDY,This is a juvenile level production geared toward children or early teens at best. It was not my cup of tea,1243900800,2,107,4.142857142857143
