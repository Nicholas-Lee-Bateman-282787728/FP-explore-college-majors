3924121,5,B002FVPFU2,"The Battle for Terra was an independently produced 3D animation film that was in theaters in May.  It played in some festivals like Tribeca and won Best Animated Feature at Ottowa Animation Festival, which is THE animation festival (Oscar nom Persepolis won the year prior). It got rave reviews from film critics like Ebert and Variety, but was purchased by Lionsgate who didn't market it properly, hence a disappointing box office for this gusty little animated film. Which is especially a shame because in 3D it was achingly beautiful, definitely the very best use of 3D I've seen. Felt like you were swimming right along in that other world with gorgeous creatures like winged blue whales that roam among the clouds.

Also notable was the top notch casting. Evan Rachel Wood is especially excellent as the voice of adorable alien heroine, and Brian Cox haunting as the creepy Bush-like warmonger General. David Cross, one of the the best comedians out there right now, gave brief bits of comic relief as testy robot sidekick.

A great movie for families, who can enjoy the visuals and drama while giving kids an intelligent intro into ethics, environmentalism, ethnocentrism, and more. This is how family movies should be--entertainment that challenges kids to think.

Despite the poster, this touching film is much more than an action movie. Highly recommended!",1253750400,3,1365,5.080357142857143
3924122,5,B002FVPFU2,"**NOTE: Having just recently watched AVATAR, I was blown away to discover that it was just a better FX version of BATTLE FOR TERRA (but without the slight comical bits supplied by the robot and better story elements supplied by the writers).  Both deal with humans trying to forcibly get what they want from an alien world with no thought for it's inhabitance.  Both have a soldier starting out only fallowing orders, but who eventually becomes an champion for the plight of the alien populace.  The similarities go on and on to the point that one really starts to wonder if AVATAR shouldn't have given a ""Based On"" nod to BATTLE FOR TERRA for inspiring it (oh, and in case you're thinking to yourself that it might be the other way around, and that TERRA copied AVATAR's story, just keep in mind that TERRA took over 4 years to make, which is years before AVATAR was made.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This movie is a reversal of the old, ""Alien Invasion"" clich, where instead of our home world being invaded by aliens, we are the invading force on a peaceful planet after wars have destroyed our own world.

There is a good moral core at the center of this film and even though the situations in this tale seem black and white (or cut and dry) there are variant shades of grey permeating the story, making nothing seem forced for story continuity, or even easy for the sake of not asking the tough questions.

Also take note that even though the animation might seem oriented towards the small fry, the story has a slightly more complex underlying theme to it that (although the small fry will no doubt enjoy it) is aiming for a wider audience, and does succeed.

I've read a review where someone loosely compared this film to WALL-E, and I'd say that in certain aspects there are some similar flavorings (i.e. animation style to an extent, and the preservation of nature) but this film nicely stands on it's own in both ideas and execution.

So if you're looking for a nice little slice of epic story telling, done with a lot of heart and soul, then this film will not let you down.",1253664000,8,2152,4.7479892761394105
3924123,5,B002FVPFU2,"This movie was great.  It was the first 3-D movie I ever went and saw.  Due to the horrible job done promoting this movie not many people even saw it.  Which is fine because my friend and I had the whole theater to ourselves. A private screening at a public movie theater of one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.  Most people won't like this movie because it makes us humans out to be the bad guys.  The movie was great. Animation for being made with the money it was made for is excellent.  The message great.  If you are one of the ones who didn't get to see this in theaters, which I'm sure most of you reading this are aside from a few scary moments which may disturb younger viewers this movie truly is a diamond in the rough.",1253491200,17,742,4.075862068965518
3924124,5,B002FVPFU2,"This Blu has been screening nicely in the store as sadly no one got to see this with that joke of a theatrical release slate.

Plenty to dissect here regarding both the subtle and overlaying future of humanity themes, but in the end the positive outcomes shine through as does the awesome animation, both preserved beautifully on the Blu. This recent trend of 5.1 Uncompressed PCM on Blu is a nice change, and it bodes well for an action filled finale like this. The clarity, colors and style of animation look great here, and I bookmarked the last 17 minute battle scene for customers and that alone has sold itself. The supplements are a bit mismanaged and include:
* 4:45 minute making-of. Way too short for what this film took to make, and most of the other extras should have been spliced into this selection.
* 4 deleted scenes totaling 7 minutes. For what this film was they all should have been left in their respective sequences.
* 25 second quip on a storyboard to final rendering analysis on one scene.
* 2:13 minute Animatics picture in picture clip. Shows the animation changes between production levels of the escape sequence.
* 20 slides containing text and and drawing notes of initial production design.
* Pulling the Strings, 1:26 minute low grade animation clip of the director stating his reasons for making this and other films and what he hopes to accomplish.
* Crew commentary, catered to the animation followers.

The menu is eye catching and plays with some decent music. The navigation is too extensive for younger viewers and could have been made much simpler regarding the supplements (combine everything next time). This gets a 5 rating for Lionsgate on a solid picture and sound product. A PG rating with maybe a few scary moments for really young viewers, but presentable to everyone, I think. Have not had any kids run screaming to mom yet while it plays here. Hope you enjoy.",1253404800,33,1908,4.743975903614458
3924125,5,B002FVPFU2,"Battle for Terra is one of those rare films that dares to have a politically charged message: Genocide and ecocide is inexcusable under any and all circumstances; following your conscience can have an extraordinarily high price; and government is best run by civilians and not by a military dictatorship!

This exact same subject matter of humans colonizing another world at the expense of another intelligent and benevolent species is rarely covered in science fiction on the big screen. Human beings are usually the victims of some evil alien power. It's nice to see the tables turned for once and witness human beings as the oppressors, or bad guys.

This is truly a profound and subversive story. Too bad it was shown on only one screen in a metropolitan area with 1 1/2 million people! It deserves to have been seen by a much wider audience!

While watching Battle for Terra, I asked myself repeatedly, ""What would I do in a similar situation?"" I realize I will never be a soldier in a critical battle that will determine the destiny of the human race. But I'm forced to examine the power I have, no matter how small, to battle evil and injustice when given the opportunity to do so! That's the beauty of a subversive story! It makes you think!

3924128,2,B002FVPFU2,"The epic scope of a brand new world and the futuristic human populace that attempts to invade it proves to be a little too ambitious in Battle for Terra; bland character designs and dull dialogue can't quite manage to adequately complement the effective, though heavily overused, storyline. While the alien structures and massive human ships provide intriguing visuals and creative CG craftsmanship, the inhabitants of such visions leaves something to be desired. The humans display less detail than cheap plastic action figures and the aliens astoundingly disprove the theory that creatures with large eyes are inherently cute. The inventiveness behind an extraterrestrial society living in the winding stalks of giant mushrooms amidst a herd of floating sky whales feels sadly wasted.

The inhabitants of the planet Terra live in complete peace, with each other as well as their ecosystem of exotic floating wildlife. But such harmony is cataclysmically interrupted when invaders from Earth attack the planet and begin kidnapping many of the Terrians, including the father of rebellious young Mala (Evan Rachel Wood). In an attempt to follow her father's captors, Mala chases human pilot Jim Stanton (Luke Wilson), whose ship becomes damaged in the ensuing skirmish and crash-lands at the outskirts of the alien city. Saving Jim's life, she brings the human back to her house where she agrees to fix his ship in exchange for his help in rescuing her father. But time is quickly running out as dastardly human General Hemmer's (Brian Cox) plot against the alien world collides in an epic battle with the species' dark past, and the two renegade fighters must sacrifice everything to stop the destruction of Terra.

It isn't obnoxiously preachy, but the methods of badgering the audience over the depletion of natural resources and self-destruction through war don't boast originality. And former allies fighting on opposing sides is a particularly familiar theme. The absence of communication between alien species and the poor communication amongst the humans leads to a hostile takeover attempt that asks viewers to oppose humankind and route for a seemingly defenseless, peace-loving breed. Battle for Terra has uncovered a shocking truth: humans are bad. To further expound that thinking is a singular villainous leader who can take the blame - without Hemmer, it would be too much to contravene the human race. But the Terrians have shortcomings as well; the elders, their teachings, restricted inventions and forbidden territories riddle their culture with morality questions.

The look of the film provides a very mixed result. The environment of Terra is the high point, with towering mushroom homes, abrupt changes in atmospheric conditions as the cameras move across various elevations, and many floating objects (including primitive airships and enormous sky whales). But the Terrians themselves appear too simple - as if for the sake of easier animation, the natives are little more than tadpoles with large eyes, three-fingered hands, and no lips or nose. The humans are comparably simplistic, with little attention to the texturing details that typically grace Pixar animation.

Battle for Terra is too ambitious an idea for a computer animated children's film, posing the typical problems that face many similar endeavors. It's not intense enough for adults and too expansive for little kids, and many of the concepts (including organic data downloading to skirt the natural language barrier) are painfully contrived. On a positive note, the score has an appropriate science-fiction resonance and dramatic fervor which overshadows some of the flaws in pacing and framing.

3924188,1,B002FVPFU2,"Hats off if this was an indie production. To create a modern animated movie is time-consuming and requires talent and patience. However if this is a big budget studio production I'd give it zero stars for cutting such severe corners on modern CGI capabilities. The animation is too fluid, unlike real motion physics, and the facial expressions overly exaggerated. Initially I read the blurb about this movie, not watched any trailers, and jumped right into the movie. I was hoping for a live action movie. [!!!spolier alert!!!] What I got was something in the vein of a kiddie movie but with a grown up issue--unprovoked war. This movie is about mankind attacking happy peaceful creatures on some distant planet to gain by force the resources of that planet. I couldn't get more than 15 seconds into this before I started clicking through to see if this movie was for me or not. I couldn't stomach the exaggerated emotions. Childish movie. Again, if this is an indie production my hat is off to the staff and crew for their efforts. I have former coworkers from my old tech days who still work in animation at global animation companies. So I know from their descriptions pulling a movie together is hard to do. But still, the animation feels outdated and not quite 'right' for modern CGI tech.

Multiple occasions of deus ex machina, forgivable in some scenarios but utterly unforgivable in others, pepper this somewhat lame movie. The less said about the voice-overs, the better. Although it looks family friendly, with its cute little aliens and their flesh-hair (Why? WHY?!), there are multiple frightening images and the movie ends by killing off one of its two main characters. Bleh. The statue in the end has no hair.

To be fair, I'm sure movies have been made slanted in the other direction too.  And, there looks to be many people giving high marks to the movie for some reason.

What a disappointment.  After seeing so many positive reviews here, I decided to give this a shot for my kids. My seven-year-old daughter fell asleep. My eight-year-old son looked at me when it was over and said, ""that was depressing dad. It didn't have to end that way.""

He's exactly right. The movie was very depressing and without giving away too much of a spoiler, there was no  need for it to end that way. This wasn't some kind of an Academy award winning movie where they needed to have some sort of major character demise for it to be taken seriously. It's just an animated movie.

Also it's really just a remake of avatar.*  We have human beings come coming to a Planet as the bad guys. An army commander who is willing to kill off an entire native population in order for the humans to take the planet. No conscience at all. So once again the humans are the bad guys and the nature loving aliens are the good guys. I mean it's not even an attempt to look like something different than avatar.  Plus it's so tiring to see the same cardboard characters. The army commander who doesn't care at all about right and wrong. The do-gooders who are on a council that don't really have any power and a soldier who has to choose to do the right thing. It's a very clich.

I'm just kind of tired of  Hollywood liberals always making us the bad guys. I don't need my kids dealing with this kind of junk. I'll give it to stars because it was decently done and the story was moderately interesting. But that's about it. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",1460505600,,1709,4.4

We invade others and how the two sides perceive each other.  No different than any war we face since the beginning of time; we somehow are told the enemy is always bad, all of them, so kill them because we don't want you to know anything about your enemy that can cause you to sympathize with them.  Well in this movie, one person accidentally learns about the culture of his enemy and sympathizes with the enemy.  How does he face his own kind, and is he a bad person for not wanting to destroy his enemy?  Must he choose between them and us?  Must he kill because he is told to do so?

3924285,1,B002FVPFU2,"I rarely give a 1-star rating to anything, unless it demands it.

A Christmas Eve tradition at our house is that the kids will all sleep together.  To help them fall asleep faster, they choose a movie that is in their opinion, absolutely terrible.  Past selections include ""The Brave Little Toaster"", ""Xanadu"", ""Labyrinth"", etc.  ""Battle For Terra"" is right down there with these titles, if not below (I actually like Xanadu).

Some people absolutely love this movie, and that's one of the things that makes America great - freedom of expression.  Let's just say that people with that opinion and I will have to agree to disagree.

The animation is actually quite good.  There was a LOT of work put into this film.  It also has some great voice actors, e.g., Luke Wilson.  However, the story line is, well just plain terrible.

SPOILERS - Humans have destroyed their planet so they need a new home.  They find Terra, a beautiful planet that has everything they could hope for, except a peaceful indigenous species already in residence.  The humans decide that the only solution is to wipe out the residents so they can have the planet for themselves.  Come on!  Can't we move past our destructive, ugly history?  This was just too close to American history and the dastardly treatment of Native Americans during the USA period of Manifest Destiny and westward expansion.  I was totally put off by this ongoing view that the only way to benefit from something is to remove every other possible impediment.  Sheesh, the natives know their own planet and would be the greatest resource the displaced humans could have hoped for.

3924286,1,B002FVPFU2,"You know what the worst part of this movie is? You can tell certain people worked really hard on it; unfortunately none of them were writers. It has pretty good music, nice sound design, impressive effects work, but literally nothing else.

I'm not sure how this has four stars; maybe most of the reviewers haven't seen many movies? Its like discount: Star Wars (not sure how they avoided lawsuits with some wildly blatant copying), Wall-E, Avatar, etc. all rolled into one but yielding nothing good. I can't remember how many times this movie brought me to laughter but for all the wrong reasons.

At points the dialogue would have you believe the demographic was very young children. At other times, the serious and morbid themes that pop out of nowhere leave you thinking it must have been for older teen audiences. It fails, however, at either end to be something worth watching. The movie is clichd to the point of coming across as a parody. I watched it while wrapping presents this year, it kept me awake and laughing so thats good. I still wish I could have laughed because it was witty and not because the writing was so intensely poor.

I would say this would be OK for little kids but it gets way too dark. Its too poorly written for any teenagers, so I really don't know who to recommend it to. If you're doing chores and just want something on, it might be ok?",1450742400,2,1373,4.528225806451613

Nothing short of amazing quality of video and sound. We all know that watching 3D fools the human eye, but this movie is the best foolery of them all. There are few movies that comes to mind in regards of superb quality in 3D. I can mention Sammy's Adventure is one of the 3D movies that can be ranked right up there with this one.

If you are on the fence about getting this one, I would not wait too long because once the word gets out how high the quality on this movie, it may not be around.

Why was there so much hate on the human side? john's first reactions tells me something happened before hand that passed human's off enough to attack ,what by everything we knew at the time, was a defenseless people. A people that lived in 1984 for generations yet had a whole working air force equivalent to the human's. To me it would seem like the elder's told the human's to go die and here some help. The humans attack but are confused as to why the found nothing but primitives, the general uses the confusion to take power while the elders are forced to reveal their hidden tech. The final battle happens only at the end the elders are also kick out of power allowing the alien's and human's to work things out and start growing again.",1387584000,,983,4.313513513513514

Also, I usually don't like movies that are this short (I consider any movie under 90 minutes short), but this movie was perfect. It put everything into that time frame just right, so it didn't seem packed in or rushed at all.

Parents: It's not a SCARY movie, but some parts were a little bit tense.

Final note: I like it that it wasn't cliched (that is, it wasn't the typical black-and-white good vs evil thing). There was some good and some bad on BOTH sides. I found myself rooting for the humans one minute and the Terrians the next!

In this movie humans are the genocidal villains attempting to perpetuate the species by tera-forming the planet for human habitation. One of the outtakes explains that some humans disagree with this approach. Hollywood political agenda to discredit the military?

No explanation is given for the advanced military hardware of the Terrains. What happened in the past? The lead human has been won over to the peacefulness of the locals yet cant overcome blindly following orders. In the end he is a hero but what took so long?

If you are able to get past even the basic laws of physics then you are in for an hour and twenty minutes of pain. Clearly the films writers and director are deep down inside ashamed of themselves or really who they perceive the human race to be. The idea that someone would turn on their own kind because of a brief interaction with a alien race is disgusting.

Their sad lack of writing, direction, and deep down self loathing, are what kill a movie with excellent animation and potential. the fact a studio released this movie after viewing it makes me sad and believe morons run the studio.",1352592000,5,684,4.560975609756097
3924437,5,B002FVPFU2,"There seem to be some who think this movie copies Avatar. It is actually the other way around.  This movie came out in 3D in theaters 2 years BEFORE Avatar did.  It's certainly interesting to compare the two movies and see how the plot lines and main characters in Avatar bear an extremely close resemblance to the ones in this movie. You can decide for yourself which one is the real ""knock off"".

This movie itself is a wonderful gem with a lot of heart and interesting story line as well as very good animation, action and battle scenes. It delves deeply into duty vs. conscience as the few surviving humans of a destroyed earth search desperately for a new planet on which to settle before their space ark completely breaks down and they run out of oxygen and supplies.

At least in this case, the human's ruthlessness in trying to take over the planet and terraform it, in spite of the fact that this would result in the death of all the indigenous life forms including the intelligent and peace loving Terran civilization, is a simple matter of raw survival for what's left of the human race.

The graphics and audio quality are excellent, the action is fast paced and the main characters are very engaging.

I don't usually mind preachy films or cheesy kids films or ones with lackluster graphics -- but this is too much. The dialogue is painful, the plot is extremely shallow and unoriginal and all the characters are forgettable.

Younger children might glean some enjoyment from it, seeing as it is very colourful, but it's not something I'd want my kids to watch. This film has no real characters, only caricatures. You have your square chinned, domineering, soulless, cold, white, male servicemen who are opposed to the warm, peaceful, spiritual, ethnic aliens. One of the key human politicians is a quiet, sympathetic woman who watches the army murder the native inhabitants in helpless silence. The president of the humans is black, but easily overrun by the faceless white military. I get that this is a low budget film trying to push an eco message - I have no real quabble with that - but I do have a problem with reinforcing harmful stereotypes in the process.",1350432000,17,1053,4.7228260869565215
3924439,1,B002FVPFU2,"If you like themes such as man's self destructive nature, humans destroying the planet, the military leadership prefers military solutions over diplomacy, and all nature is good and technology is bad, then you will enjoy the content of this movie.

If you like overacted canned lines, where bad guys have sinister voices, and good guys speak in smooth dulcet tones, then you'll enjoy the dialog.

If you appreciate CGI where everything is in focus no matter how close or far away it is, all objects stay in focus no matter how fast you zoom in on them from a distance, where every object surface is evenly textured, where the air contains no dust or particles to create light beams to add some sense of atmosphere with space and depth other than vanishing point perspective, and where there are no simulated lens artifacts or any other attempts at simulating optics the way the human eye experiences them, then you'll enjoy the animation.

If you like themes that have been recycled so many times that only the youngest of children or most severe amnesiacs will find the ideas original, then you might enjoy this movie.

If you enjoy the smell of freshly utilized cat litter or dumpsters outside fish processing plants in July, then you have the olfactory discrimination to appreciate this stinker.",1349913600,8,1298,4.85972850678733

The thing that makes this movie superior to the Miners vs. Blue Cats adventure is that there's a real believable motivation for the human characters. It's one thing to be rapacious going after natural resources - of course we would do that, because we do that now - but at some point, we would just cut our losses and go home. If the humans in Avatar didn't have that option, if there was no Earth left, then you'd have the much more complicated moral and ethical dilemma of this film.",1349395200,,584,4.4672897196261685
3924441,5,B002FVPFU2,"I LOVE this movie, which I was very happy to have seen the day it opened in the theaters back in 2009. I loved it then, and I love it just as much now. One of the things I love about science fiction is the alien worlds and civilizations. So, I really enjoyed the way the movie opens with showing us everyday life on an alien world--something we rarely get to see.

Another thing is the dilemma that the Humans face. If they terraform the planet, the Terrians die, but they can't go any further because their ship won't last much longer. The question of how they would solve this kept me watching.

A common complaint in a lot of the negative reviews seem to be about the focus on the environment. First of all, the main focus is not the environmental message, it is the dilemma. But, speaking about the environmental message, I found it nice to finally have a movie that acknowledges the effects on the environment. So often in alien invasion movies like this (or war movies in general), we only see the effects on the sentients involved. Very rare is it for a movie to acknowledge the effect that war has on the environment and the other creatures inhabiting the planet. That's the point, I believe, of the Sky Whale getting hit in the battle.

And, of course, I cannot write a review of this movie without mentioning the score. I have never heard of Abel Korzeniowski before this movie, but he certainly did an outstanding job with the score. It's beautiful and sinister at the same time. During the speeches on both sides just before the climatic battle, you can feel the weight of the stakes involved. If for nothing else, watch the movie for the music.",1344038400,,1657,4.4801324503311255

3924443,4,B002FVPFU2,"Battle for Terra is a dynamic tale of desperation & misunderstanding. It is hard to believe that earthlings could be this irresponsible, & could be so ruthless, that they would be wiling to commit genocide, just to have a new home.

Yet, even after all these centuries, humanity has failed to learn from their mistakes.

The major characters in this movie, are the Terrian Mala, & the human pilot, Lt. James Stanton.

The Terrians are a superstitious people who initially think that when the ARK, (the humans spaceship), first arrives above their planet-they believe it to be gods. But the leaders of the Terrians know better, because unknown to many of their people, they have been secretly preparing for the possible invasion of their planet, although being a peaceful people-knew that possibility might happen at some time.

Their unwillingness to trust any human, is echoed in the fact that the same thing could be said about humans attitudes to trust an alien species-a viewpoint that leads to a full-scale invasion of Terra, something the Terrians have been preparing for, for years.

Yet, there is a great sadness in this movie, in the fact that the humans are desperate, because the ARK is literally disintegrating around them, & there is almost no time left for them TO find a new home.

While the leadership aboard the ARK, does not want want war, the military leader aboard the ARK, is not willing to wait. He overthrows the ARK'S leaders, & launches the full scale invasion of Terra.

It is only through the friendship of the Terrian Mala & the human, James Stanton, the complete genocide of the Terrians is avoided, though not without without a terrible price being paid.

The storyline is driving all through this movie-the desperation of the humans, & the determination of the Terrians. The action sequences are thrilling, between the earthlings & the Terrians in the determining battle for Terra.

It is a story of determination, desperation, & cooperation, that makes this an extremely exciting & powerful movie well worth seeing!",1334966400,,2047,4.944606413994169
3924444,5,B002FVPFU2,"Battle for Terra is an amazingly good family friendly science fiction film. The general premise is that Earth was destroyed in a war and the survivors of humanity have to colonize a new planet in a different solar system if they are to survive. However, this planet turns out to be inhabited by alien intelligent life, and conflict ensues.
The film does a really good job at getting you to care about the characters. The main characters are interesting and multidimensional. One complaint I had was that some of the human characters look a little too similar to me, but overall I liked the CGI and animation style, especially in the combat scenes. The voice acting is also really good. I particularly enjoyed hearing Brian Cox play General Hemmer. (He did Scolar Visari's voice in the Killzone series and he was Stryker in the Xmen movies.)
The overall plot has some sad elements to it, but it has a happy ending and is very touching overall. It examines some of the darker aspects of humanity, such as our predisposition to violence and rapid consumption of resources, but in the end, some of man's redeeming qualities are what define the film. I would highly recommend it, especially to scifi fans who want to watch a cool movie with their family.",1329264000,,1249,4.707762557077626

What sets this film apart from the other big film companies is the serious nature of the plot. Essentially, Terra's inhabitants are being invaded by the human race who are seeking a livable planet to sustain their own existence. There is also not that much humor which fits well for this film given the serious nature of the plot. The final battle at the end of this film is worth the purchase alone.

3924451,1,B002FVPFU2,"I don't know what the relationship was between the makers of this movie and the makers of Avatar, but this movie and Avatar seem highly alike, except this one seems like a cheaper, scaled down, more child-friendly version.  In both movies mankind has stumbled upon a planet that is useful for humanity, but is occupied by a native species.  In both movies, mankind decides to take the alien planet by force, and do so by killing of the natives.  And in both movies, a human soldier befriends a local female, gets converted to the native side, and helps to fight against his own people.  So two very similar movies, but with very different results at the box office.

Whereas Avatar is a heavyweight among recent films, Terra disappeared from the big screen soon after it debuted, and received minimal notice from critics.  Personally, I agree with its failure.  For a movie made in 2007 with state of the art special effects, the film suffers from horrible screen-writing.  First of, the aliens speak English.  Yes, there is another planet in this Galaxy occupied by aliens that speak perfect American English.  Second, they have very American habits, such as public schools, rebellious teenagers, kids who don't like their parents' cooking, rulers who like to hide facts from their people, etc...  Third, it is quite easy to tell the male aliens from the female aliens.  Seeing that most people would not be able to distinguish a male dolphin from a female dolphin, or a male crocodile from a female crocodile, even though dolphins and crocodiles are familiar animals on Earth, why would this movie's producers go to the trouble to make the aliens so easily recognizable as boys and girls.  Now all this would be ok if the movie was comedy, such as in Planet 51.  But for a ""serious"" movie, these clear white-washes suspend belief.  If you want to watch a child-friendly movie about humans visiting another world, might I suggest Planet 51 or some of the Star Trek movies instead.",1291507200,5,1981,4.8023598820058995

Of all the movies mentioned, AVATAR is of course the biggest and knock-you-out $lick; but BATTLE FOR TERRA is more empathetic and touching. It seems so because it's more compassionate and, truthfully, smaller. It's not preachy or tuned for violence but concentrates on beings' beliefs, motives and feelings. As such it stands apart on its own, and in some aspects, above.

3924461,2,B002FVPFU2,"I didn't like this movie. I felt that it was too slow, too boring and too preachy. The message that the creators were trying to convey is about as subtle as a sledgehammer. In one corner we have the Terraians, a tadpole-like flying race of aliens who live on Terra. They are peaceful and welcome all that life brings. They treasure the arts and are very creative and intuitive. They live in harmony with nature and have created a beautiful life and a beautiful world. In the other corner we have Earth's refugees. Apparently, we have not only destroyed our own planet by using up all of our natural resources, but we destroyed two colonies and Earth through war. Now we have spent a lifetime traveling throughout the galaxy in search of a planet that we can colonize and found one in Terra. There is just one problem: the Terraians. Enter crazy military general who executes a military coup and decides that the best thing to do is change the atmosphere on the planet so that it is oxygen-rich, which will kill the Terraians. Of course, one Terraian and one Earthling meet, get along, save each others' lives, realize that all life is precious, blah, blah, blah. You know the drill.

For me, this was a slow-paced, fairly blandly animated environmentally self-conscious film. I felt that the creators were much more interested in getting across their political agenda (military is bad, war is terrible, nature is all that is important and will bring peace, don't overuse resources, all life is valuable, etc.) that they forgot to make an interesting story to feature the agenda to keep people watching. I admit that I paused the movie several times to read some book chapters, go out to lunch, etc. Then I had to brace myself to turn the movie back on -- and it is only an hour and a half! It felt like longer. Also, it was difficult for me to relate to the characters as they were animated in such a bland, Barbie-doll like way. I guess I shouldn't say that about Barbie, I mean her animated movies feature characters with more expression than these guys. The faces were very dough-like and featureless. They really showed no emotions. I felt the most emotion from the little robot-helper guy who at least brought a little bit of charm to the film.

The battle sequences are pretty cool and actually caused me to bump by rating up by 0.5 stars. They are a little bit intense for younger viewers. It is also pretty clear that people are dying. It is kind of like the Star Wars: A New Hope movie where you see people in their cockpits and then a big explosion around them and they are just gone. I know other reviewers have said that you may want to be careful about younger viewers as these scenes may be too much for younger kids and they might get scared, but, if you are watching this on your TV at home, I wouldn't worry. Perhaps if you were watching it in a movie theatre where it is big and overwhelming, but it is not that scary.

Anyway, I was not happy with the ending of the movie. I always feel that a little bit of diplomacy goes a long way. I hate that the military is always portrayed as the bad guy in science fiction movies. They are doing what they do: protect and defend. Without the proper intel, they screw up. They are people too, they just have guns to back up their point of view. So I feel that the other humans on board the ship needed to push for some more recon and for information on the natives of the planet before they went in with guns blazing. It was pretty clear the Terraians, while airborne, were a peaceful people. There were no signs of weapons and no threats made towards Earth's gunships. I get frustrated with movies like this one because no one can win. Everyone loses. It just goes to show that, with better diplomats, and a more concerted effort to understand other cultures, we would know a lot more peace.",1274745600,7,3851,4.467329545454546

When you read a sci-fi book you build a world in your mind's eye that reflects in part what the author wants you to see, but also in part what you are capable of creating. On the other hand, a movie is much more of what the author/director create: You, as the observer, are simply asked to suspend your disbelief for an hour or two, and at best be drawn into the world that is being presented to you.

It is pleasurable to see the artist's vision of an alien world. This movie is interesting for that reason.

3924480,5,B002FVPFU2,I have to say I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie.  I really like the plot that so mirrors concerns about how we are slowly killing our planet.  This theme is common in anime so for this animated movie to use it is not unusual.  I saw a copy of this before I bought it and getting it on bluray was a no-brainer.  I was able to notice the difference you usually see (atleast in my opinion) when watching a movie you have seen on lesser quality formats.

3924483,5,B002FVPFU2,"Why in the world did I have to stumble upon this movie while looking at descriptions of other movies?  Why does the ""official"" review seem to have been written with someone with no eye for art or appreciation of what the vast majority of us can obviously see?

The combination of mesmerizingly beautiful animation, equally beautiful soundrack, and characters that I could feel for drew me in right from the start.  And then there's a story that at least tries to be original and not rehash of something else.  I couln't see the plot coming at me minutes away as with some sci-fi stuff that's out there.  And, it's a way smarter movie than any of the Star Wars movies were.  Combine that with competant and experienced voice actors, and a cute robot (OK, that's been done to death, but it's a really cute robot) and this is truly a Sci-Fi movie with everything.

Warning, spoilers below.

From what I read about this movie, I went into it expecting it to be anti-military environmentalist propaganda.  I was pleasantly surprised to find out that there really isn't is totally ""good"" side or a totally ""evil"" side in this Battle for Terra.  The suposedly ""evil"" humans are motivated by desperation and the need to act quickly to find a new home (I won't give away why).  And, the supposedly ""good"" and peace-loving Terrans seem to be pacifists at first, and many of them are, but they can afford to be due to the forward and not-so-pacifistic thinking of some of their leadership.

I suppose the only thing that mars this overall effect of this movie for me is that I thought the human characters were not animated in much detail.  They looked more like humans looked when the 3D animation genre first started, rather primitive and free of detail.  That was sort of disappointing, but I got over it fast.

So, why isn't everyone talking about this one?  One look at the reviews here says that there are many messages one could take away from this movie.  It's something adults, and more mature children (it really isn't for the little ones), could watch and spend all of dinner the next evening talking about.  Just what is this movie trying to say anyway?  It seems that battle is well under way.

Now, if only we could get this movie to a wider audience!",1255651200,2,2254,4.5875

3924488,3,B002FVPFU2,"I didn't know what to expect in BATTLE FOR TERRA. I hadn't heard much about it, but many were raving about it so I got it. I like animated movies and I'm 40. I have a daughter who's 8 and a son who's 4.

Quickly I realized that what the animators have done with this movie was mind-blowing. The animation is tremendous. The world that they have created is beautiful, full and rich. See, the creators have created this alternate world with what we eventually learn is an alien environment that lives in peace until they are invaded without warning. Invaded by who? Of course, humans. The most violent and peaceless inhabitants of the god created world.

Technically, I WOULD give this movie 4 stars just on the creativity and beauty alone. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. The battles between the crude Terrian flying apparatus and the high tech human battle planes are amazing. Yet, the movie is also way too self important for its own good. There's almost an arrogance in the way the story is told. It's heavy, depressing and needed to desperately find some fun to break the drag.

Which leads me to why I give the movie 3 stars. My 8-year old lost interest 30 minutes in and my 4-year old maybe five minutes in. I understand that the movie isn't intended to be a kid movie, but it didn't have to be boring. I even found it slightly boring.

Personally, I was just blown away by the animation and the depth of the world that was created to tell the story in. The story on the other hand, was too heavy handed and draggy. They should have lightened up a bit.",1254268800,5,1565,4.404844290657439

I have seen proof positive that the kind of movies I want to see and support are actually being made. Buy or rent a copy of Battle for Terra. It's totally worth the good karma points. We need to demonstrate there's a market for these folks.

Battle for Terra has been directed and written by Aristomenis Tsirbas. Evan Spiliotopolous is the screenwriter.  Well done. May the Blu-ray and DVD sales make up for what didn't happen in the box office.

In the making of segment, the Tsirbas explained that he intended for this to be an ""invasion"" movie. Humans are the invaders this time around. Spiliotopolous also points out that an animation like this is adult fare. Countries such as Japan and France can create animation for grownups, but in the US, audiences are still slow to catch on.

As a person of color, I usually identify with aliens in science fiction. I watch movies expecting the aliens to get the short end of the stick just like human, so-called ""minority"" groups.

I observed the pale-skinned, three-fingered, tadpole people glide through the first few minutes of the movie. I call them tadpole people because they had the same kind of vestigial tail without fins. They literally float-swam through their atmosphere which incidentally was poisonous to humans. The Terrans were cute in the sense that E.T. and the Muppets are cute which helps with viewer empathy. Big eyes never fail. At first, the majority of the Terran population revered the invading humans as gods. Terran Elders seemed to have a different opinion of the happenings but they refused to share what they knew with their own people. The plot thickened.

Mala was the fiesty Terran heroine who rescued a human, Jim Stanton, in order to save her own captured father. By the time, we got this part, I'd been thinking this could be Pocahontas meets John Smith 2009 times worse. With his square chin and close-shaved head, Jim Stanton looked like a Space Marine posterboy with a designer eyebrow cut. (Stanton, incidentally, reminded Her Tangh-i-ness of Richard Corben's Den. Visually. Not actually.) Jim Stanton's character arc required him to move from seeing the Terrans as potential hostiles to sacrificing his life for their welfare. Mala lost her own father but successfully defended her home planet from the crippled generation ship populated by desperate humans. It turned out the Terrans once had a warlike period but banished the evidence to the outer regions of the planet and certain underground facilities.

When I noticed the Black human President voiced by Danny Glover, I think I relaxed a tiny bit. The film's antagonist, a suitably hawkish General Hemmer leads a coup against the President in order to ensure survival of the human race. Hemmer intends to terraform the planet and write off the intelligent Terran population as collateral damage. Humans will once again have a home despite the lethal cost to another species. If Hemmer had said, ""Stay the course,"" to Jim Stanton, we could have substituted Hemmer for any number of recent political figures.

I expected Jim Stanton and Mala to save the day, but I didn't expect the hero to die in order to make things right. This is where I really appreciated the risk taken by the director and writers. Sacrifice usually falls in standard movie fare upon some hapless sidekick (often a person of color) whose death clears the path to resolution between the warring parties. The hero strides into the sunset with the heroine on his arm and credits roll.

But it didn't go down like that in Battle for Terra. Jim Stanton takes out Hemmer and everyone else aboard the terraformer in order to put a stop to the madness. Can we say deep? After his suicide run, the Terrans opt to share their world with humans who are confined to a dome where oxygen-producing foliage can allow them to peacefully co-exist. Mala and Stanton's younger brother share a feel-good moment.

Even as much as I'm down for Spock and Uhura, I cringed at the thought of an interspecies romance but Battle for Terra didn't go there either. Thank the Force. Jim Stanton got a statue dedicated to his memory. Mala glided into the sunset piloting her own ship accompanied by a love interest of her own kind. And the Black President survived.

I can totally understand why parents might be loathe to answer questions from their little ones after watching. Why there's that disturbing near-death scene of all those cute tadpole people. And who really wants to own up to the predatorial nature of the human species?

Thinking parents who want to raise the next generation of staunch Pro-Alienists like Her Tangh-i-ness cogitate, then teleport, but don't walk to get a copy of Battle for Terra.

Peace,

Her Tangh-i-ness",1254096000,4,5039,5.173218673218673
3924491,4,B002FVPFU2,"The storyline and animation are very good. The theme, earthman invaders, is for adult consumption, and not great for children.  If you overlook  the sharp criticism of humanity, it is an enjoyable movie.",1254096000,2,203,5.121212121212121
3924492,5,B002FVPFU2,"This is a top-notch movie and I only regret that I waited for the DVD rather than seeing it at the theater.  Large-screen TV owners, take note: This one has a big, bold look that will look great sprayed across your wall-sized screens.

Even with my more modest screen, there was much here to love, not least of which was a compelling story with some real meat to it.  And some real grit in the telling.  This is a story that young children will find too intense, but those mature enough to handle it will find that they are not being talked down to or pandered to.  They are treated instead to a gripping tale of sacrifice, values, courage, friendship, compromise, loyalty, cooperation...a great many virtues.  And yet, even stuffed full of terrific virtue lessons, the story never feels like mere propaganda, or some morality story parading around as entertainment.

The reviewer who gave ""Terra"" one star seems to think the movie villifies humans and especially the human military, but this is a fairly banal complaint since the human hero is also in the military, and what is really coming under attack is a casual disregard for the ""the other"" in seeking to assert power.

There are political components to the story, it is true, but they are blessedly integrated into an honest-to-goodness once-upon-a-time story.  This is not a tract.  This is a myth with lovable characters, loathsome characters, heroes, baddies, and breathtaking scenes of arial beauty and the carnage of Star Wars-style dogfights.

I have seen few movies in 2009 that I could recommend more highly than ""Terra""--""Up"" being a notable exception,and for many of the same reasons.  I can't guarantee that a kid under, say, 10 years old would understand or appreciate the story, but this middle-aged guy thought it was fantastic.  And having seen it right after seeing the big-screen ""Pandorum,"" I appreciated it even more.  Oddly, they touch on similar themes.  But while I thought ""Pandorum"" was diverting enough, in terms of real storytelling and big ideas, ""Battle for Terra"" wins hands down.",1254096000,4,2067,4.916426512968299

3924494,1,B002FVPFU2,"I have mixed views on this movie. First, even though it's animated, this is not a movie for kids. The animation is fantastic and there are some good action scenes. Like other reviewers have said here and on other websites, I agree that it is like so much coming out of Hollywood today that portrays the military as just a bunch of war mongers that start wars and kill just because it's fun, use war as a first resort, see it as the best solution for everything, and have no morals, no logic, no ability to think or reason. I have been trying hard not to give my dollars to movies and such that portray Americans this way (or Earthlings in this case, though we know very well who they really mean), but unfortunately, I can't return opened movies. It also protrays the humans as a species that destroyed it's own environment, then destroyed Earth itself in a war, then seeks a new home on another planet by committing genocide with no regard for the indigenous people. There are many other agendas pushed here as well. I'm surprised this isn't required viewing in our schools today like a lot of similar movies.

However, after thinking about it more, I realize that while this was obviously intended to be totally anti-military, if you are open minded and examine both sides of the situation portrayed, it can actually make the case for a strong military. Think about it. Place yourself in the viewpoint of the Terrans. It just shows that you can have an advanced, peaceful, evolved, wonderful society and yet, no matter how wonderful things are within your own borders so to speak, even the Terrans found out that there are bad people out there in the rest of the world. Even the evolved Terrans found out they had a need for a military and should have had a way to defend themselves from evil.

It's disappointing that they chose to portray humans as the evil villians in this story. Sorry for the political analysis, but this movie was obviously made with an agenda in mind, many agendas actually. It's a shame, the animators did a fantastic job with it, at least with the budget they had. But, it's political motive is probably the main reason few theaters even carried it and it bombed even at those. People have no desire to pay good money to be preached at. And, they don't like being insulted by Hollywood elites that think we're too stupid to figure out what they are up to. Worse, it angers me that this one targeted young children. The one sided indoctrination continues. Don't get me wrong, I want to protect the environment, avoid war, treat all people as equals, etc, but a movie disquised as a story for kids is not the place for this, nor should it be in a movie we pay to watch. Whatever your political views are, there is an approprate time, place, and age to make a point. Why are there no animated movies about China mistreating thier citizens, or the Taliban using women as property, or Muslims committing genocide in Darfur? It's not appropriate, and neither is this. When Hollywood decides to make a movie that's simply fun entertainment for two hours, a lot more of us will return to the theaters again. Lately, it seems no one in Hollywood can find a story to tell where Americans have done at least one good thing anytime in our history.",1254009600,32,3263,4.5476190476190474

3924496,5,B002FVPFU2,"First off, the still screen images and the DVD cover art (if you can call it that) really don't do this great little independent film justice.  If you've seen the design of the Terrans you might think this film is silly or only for kids.  It's not. It's great, moving, beautiful to look at and probably the best Sci-Fi movie and animated film I've seen in quite some time. This film has an ending that no Pixar or Dreamworks director would touch.  It doesn't leave you with that empty feeling like a lot of animated films do - at feeling of disconnect.  It's a  heart-felt film with big ideas.  As one reviewer said, it made me think ""What would I do it a situation like this?""  If you're worried about the celebrity voices or stunt casting, don't.  David Cross is perfect and actually quite serious in his role.  Evan Rachel Wood makes you care for her Terran character.  James Garner is haunting as an elder Terran.  Justin Long is funny as usual.  Luke Wilson was a surprise as well.  The director has created a perfect little world that I want to go back to again and I might just upgrade to Blu-ray for this movie alone.  The music is terrific.  If you're a lover of world-building sci-fi and great animated films you owe it to yourself to buy it.
