7889240,3,6305391904,"This is Definately aimed at Jackie Chan fans, but not so much at those who are not. Master w/ Cracked Fingers is OK, but Jackie had done much better. FMF is also a fun movie, but only that. Neither are as exciting as some of his other films. For really good older Chan films, watch Young Master, Dragons Forever, Wheels on Meals, or Drunken Master. For the price, though, Jackie Chan fans will like this.",974419200,3,404,4.4
