8426023,5,B004DTS16E,"MY CHILDREN GREW UP WITH "" MISTER RODGERS "" SO NOW I AM INTRODUCING MY GRANDCHILDREN TO THIS SERIES.

RATHER THAN CRAZY, ALL OVER THE PLACE VIDEOS, MISTER RODGERS TAKES HIS TIME TO EXPLAIN THINGS AND HAS A VERY CALMING EFFECT SO THAT CHILDREN CAN STAY FOCUSED ON ONE THING AT A TIME AND ABSORB WHAT IS BEING EXPLAINED AND SHOWN TO THEN.

MY CHILDREN WATCHED MISTER RODGERS ON CHANNEL 13, WHEN THEY WERE VERY YOUNG AND NOW,
MISTER RODGERS IS PART OF MY GRANDCHILDREN'S' VIDEO LIBRARY.

Rogers.  Clean, wholesome fun and learning for kids.  My two year old loves this the same as I did when I was a kid.  It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood.",1398988800,,191,3.973684210526316

8426027,5,B004DTS16E,"Another great Mr. Roger's week. It's wonderful how the shows are written to deal with all kinds of topics that children face growing up. There are the obvious, direct lessons: being responible for taking care of a pet, thinking things over before acting, differences in opinions and preferences. Then there are the more subtle things he just slips in such as when he asks the zoo keeper if she can also go with him to see the elephants. She responds, ""well,I'd like to but I have other things that I really need to do..."". As an adult watching these as a reminiscence(RW?), I'm always amazed at just how many things children actually need to learn. AS we get older, we just get the idea that we always knew these things but we didn't. We had to be taught and there was never a better teacher than Mr. Rogers. Thanks Fred!",1301529600,4,821,4.48
