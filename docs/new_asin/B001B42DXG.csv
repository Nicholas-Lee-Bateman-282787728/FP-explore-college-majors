8281915,4,B001B42DXG,"Neither of these movies is high on plot or for that matter likeable characters but both are setup to create as many striking visuals as possible and it succeeds on that level. The aesthetic of both films lies somewhere between 60s Batman, gothic horror, and a detective film. It allows them to have Fantomas style super villains fight knight templars in 60s style super secret agent underground lairs or have a ballerina help rescue a Zorro style super hero in a Wuthering Heights mansion made of all ivy, cobwebs, and crumbling stone.

The only downside to the movies is if you want a traditional plot. You won't get one. The films don't really have any main characters, the heroes are sort of nominally there, often they want you to root for the villains, and a lot of moments in the movies are done solely for the sake of being surreal. It's not a bad thing but it's not to everyone's taste.

Good fun and a nice price for both films. The transfers are good too.",1466640000,,965,4.508571428571429
