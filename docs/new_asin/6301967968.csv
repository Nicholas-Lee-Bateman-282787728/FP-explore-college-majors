392610,5,6301967968,"This is one of the all-time great classic films, Rod Steiger is out-standing in his role as Al Capone. The movie does have some ""Hollywood fabrications"" but all in all it is an enjoyable film which re-inacts the life and times of Al Capone.",1264291200,2,240,4.4772727272727275
392611,5,6301967968,"As a film fan, I don't know why some fine films get overlooked.  Very few people know that early in his career (1959), Rod Steiger gave an amazing performance as Al Capone.  Steiger brings all of Big Al's dark menacing qualities to life better than any other actor has done.  And the film has much more than Rod's fine work.  Unlike many other gangster films, this one has it all.  It's gritty, well-written, crisply directed, blends character development with action scenes, and features a tremendous cast (Martin Balsam; James Gregory; Nehemiah Persoff; the little-known Murvyn Vye tremendous and creepy as ""Bugs"" Moran).  Even the lighting and sets deserve praise.  Fay Spain's overacting is the only weak link.  Give this film a look; you won't be disappointed.",1255996800,3,765,5.015873015873016
392612,5,6301967968,"Absorbing and well documented portrait about the rise and fall of the famous ""scar-face"" gangster who compelled, threatened, intimidated  and kept in fear a whole city as well as his mortal enemies. The film details zealously every little step of his rise and absolute domain of the underworld., since his arrival in 1920 until his death in 1947.

Rod Steiger gives a terrific performance embodying with towering realism the minimum facets of this ruthless criminal; watch for instance the progressive dramatic succession in the body language of the big capo while he keeps going through the quest of power. Kudos also goes for Martin Balsam as Keely, a double faced reporter who played the wrong move at the moment to deal with Moran.

Pitifully, Capone's wife Fay Spain is not at the same level of the rest of the cast and the dramatic confrontation at the moment she notices Capone was the real executer arm respect her husband's murder is perhaps the only flaw along this movie. Simply regrettable her performance, which means a total blunder from the cast direction.

The St. Valentine's day massacre was another remarkable highlight in this unforgettable film.

One of the most exciting movies of the genre.",1250467200,,1213,4.985148514851486
392613,1,6301967968,"This is NOT the movie of Al Capone with Rod Steiger which is one of the best gangster films of all time...This is a cheesy documentry with a small 5 second snipit from the original movie. That's how they get away with stating that Rod Steiger stars in the movie. I bought this too from a dollar store thinking I had found a great treasure. I only wish they would realease the real movie on DVD I would surely add it to my collection but,the real movie is only available on VHS. This is just a waste of time there's much better biographies out there on Al Capone. The title is misleading and I just don't want anymore people thinking they are buying a true classic of the silver screen and ending up with this stinker. E-nuff said 1 star.",1244592000,4,737,4.271428571428571
392614,2,6301967968,"This particular documentary seems to be available under a couple of different titles, each with essentially the same DVD cover so as to be easily recognizable.  And you will want to recognize this particular item, for the folks who released it have committed the unforgivable sin of blatantly lying about the length of the program.  I only paid a buck for my copy, but it's the principle of the thing that matters.  The back of the DVD plainly says that the documentary is approximately 105 minutes long.  Maybe I need to get an ancestor of Noah Webster on the phone to verify the current meaning of the word approximately, but I'm pretty darn sure 53 minutes can in no way be considered approximate to 105 minutes.  Al Capone, if he were here, would never stand for such a snow job as this.

As for the actual documentary, it's pretty disappointing.  I did learn a few things I hadn't known about Capone (although most of it was about his brother Vincenzo), but I spent far too much time with a group of modern-day Capone enthusiasts reminiscing about the good old days and far too much time traveling down the streets of run-down modern Chi-town neighborhoods while the narrator talked about the Chicago of the 1920s.  About the only historical artifacts on display are photos of Capone.  When they talk about his time in Alcatraz, we get to see it through the eyes of modern-day tourists taking each others' pictures inside some of the old cells.  It was interesting to hear from some of Capone's nephews, but the only part of this documentary that piqued my interest at all was the story of Capone's brother Vincenzo, who left the family after one of the brothers got killed, settled in Nebraska under an assumed name (Richard Hart), joined law enforcement, and zealously went after the makers and sellers of alcohol during Prohibition.

The name of Eliot Ness is never mentioned once, which I found surprising to say the least.  Basically, I can't help but feel as if I got a rather disjointed look at the life of Al Capone in this documentary.  For the complete Capone novice, this might make a decent introduction to the legendary gangster, but there just isn't much here for those of us who already knew who Al Capone was and why he is famous.",1157587200,,2251,4.654040404040404
392615,5,6301967968,"In this movie, Rod Steiger creates the definitive Al Capone. All other movie Capones pale in comparison. Steiger and Capone were made for each other. Both realize their essential natures in each other.

Steiger may not have captured the outward fact of Chicago's most notorious gangster. I have read complaints by Capone's relatives who said Capone was in reality soft-spoken and mild-mannered, not the coarse sawed-off-shotgun of a man that Steiger portrays. That may be true. My father knew Al Capone, and always amused my mother and me when he remembered him as being simply ""amiable."" But if Steiger doesn't capture the literal tone of the gangster, he captures his spirit - and more than that, he captures the spirit of the Roaring Twenties. He's loud, vulgar, violent, but always somehow poised on the edge of wanting to be something more, something better. So when he miserably fails and slips back into mere brutality, it is all the more tragic and compelling.

This is a riveting recreation that gets a lot of the broad historical succession of gangster takeovers correct - from Big Jim Colosimo to Johnny Torrio to Al Capone. What it fictionalizes, it fictionalizes to good effect. This movie will leave a lasting impression on you. It will make you once again see Capone as iconic Chicago, the way he used to be.

Forget about [...]. Chicago is a distinctively pudgy man walking cockily off down Michigan Avenue, his panama hat at a rakish angle.",1147392000,12,1457,4.890688259109312
392616,1,6301967968,"I bought this DVD in the $1 bin at a discount store. It was one of those decisions where in I knew it would probably be a mediocre movie (as are most $1 DVDs) but since it dealt with an interesting subject (Al Capone) and had an interesting actor in the lead (Rod Steiger) I thought it couldn't be that bad. Besides, I remember once, as a child, seeing the Rod Steiger Capone movie on television and being quite impressed with it. So, this movie was purchased with a small amount of nostalgia in mind. The problem is, this DVD has nothing to do with the Rod Steiger movie. It is instead, despite the packaging which leads the purchaser into believing they are buying the Steiger film, a documentary -- and not an especially good one.

It is less than an hour long, and features a few clips from various Capone films (including a fleeting glimpse of Steiger as Capone) but mostly centers around an annoying group of people in Chicago who have formed a modern day ""We Love Capone"" club (not kidding), who drop such gems as ""I loved the social structure of the 1920s -- I would have loved to live in those times!"" Yeah right buddy, there's nothing quite like segregation, gang wars, and corruption at all levels of government.

The documentary is semi-watchable, which would have been okay if the manufacturers of this DVD told you that you were buying a documentary. They lie and tell you that you are buying a Rod Steiger movie. They ought to be sued. This is outrageous. $1 or not, they shouldn't lie like that.",1142726400,16,1511,4.490909090909091
392617,1,6301967968,"When it comes to these cheapie DVDs, there are many instances of deceptive packaging. This one, however, is probably the worst example since it's an outright lie. Despite the claim on the front that states ""Rod Steiger in AL CAPONE"" and the listing running time of 105 minutes on the back, this is actually a 50-minute 1998 TV documentary that contains a fleeting clip of Steiger from the 1959 movie that I thought I was getting. So how is the documentary? I wouldn't know, because I can't be bothered to sit through it. But don't blame the filmmakers...blame Digiview. As the old saying goes, ""When you're expecting ice cream, even the best fish tastes like poison."" Or how about this one: Spend your money on something--ANYTHING--else.",1132617600,20,737,4.857142857142857

392655,3,6301967968,"PLOT: low budget bio of Al Capone~

This version has Rod Steiger as Scareface mobster Al Capone. He becomes an underling for Johnny Torrio (Nehemiah Persoff) who pretty much controls one side of Chicago and the other is controlled by the Irish mob. Torrio and Capone become 50/50 partners and soon have gangland battles to control even more of the money from bootlegging prostitution and theft. James Gregory is very good as the ""honest"" policemen who battles Capone. Fay Spain is the widow who ends up Capone's mistress. As corrupt politicians enable the mob to better organize out in the open. Capone is sent to Florida by the Mob to cool off Chicago for the next election. The Feds are unable to arrest Capone and make it stick for a jail term but build a solid case of income tax evasion. He is sent to Alcatraz for 10 years and later....dies of complications of Syphilis.  This is a good movie. Plot is very embellished to fit the facts and make this more entertaining. Nehemiah Persoff pretty much steals the show as Johnny Torrio who develops the will to live more than the mob power and money. One interesting fact is Capone in spite of little education  was an avid lover of opera.",1451260800,4,1190,4.60377358490566
392656,4,6301967968,"The Capone family complained that Rod Steiger's version of  Al Capone was too volatile (like Jason Robards, Jr.'s), that Capone was not the violent man he was made out to be.  I've seen the real-life Capone descend a flight of stairs, an individual step in his way to ask him something or get his autograph and he roughly shoving the individual out of his way.  That did not look like a quiet gentle man to me.  That looked like a man who could orchestrate The St. Valentine's Day Massacre and then give a girl a doll for her birthday.  Yes, Capone started soup kitchens, during the stark days of the Depression.  Steiger's Capone showed more colors, including soft, gentle romantic ones, so this personage was much larger and more accessible to us the audience watching it.  Steiger never lost the menace of his character and his portrait was rich, complex. A particularly wrenching scene showed the reaction of the Fay Spain (a superb actress) learned that the man with whom she had been sleeping was the manl who had had her husband, the father of her child, killed.  That had to be a Mike Tyson blow to the chest and she performed her dramatic epiphany  magnificently.  James Gregory, his antagonist, his legal and moral enemy, managed to maintain his thread with an underwritten character  He worked as krypton to Steiger's evil Superman.  Martin Balsam, representing the corruption-filled world which enabled this overwhelming criminality, and  reached his height when, knowing he was as good as dead, he says bravely to Capone, ""You're through.""  Not even the loyalists in Hitler's bunker, with distant Allied bombs being heard dared say that to The Fuhrer.

A totally brilliant tour de force turn as Scarface Al that no one has thus far equaled or even come close to.  And there have been some serious thespian heavyweights who've had a crack at it, including Paul Muni Jason Robards and Robert DeNiro.
But Steiger tops them all.

What's overlooked in most of the reviews here however, is that some of the top character actors of the day, i.e. Nehemiah Persoff, Martin Balsam, Joe De Santis,  Al Ruscio, Ron Soble (all of whom appeared, each more than once, and Persoff in a recurring roll, as gangsters in the later iconic television series ""The Untouchables"") and James Gregory in his own Prohibition Era series as an incorruptible federal lawman, titled ""The Lawless Years"", all veterans of the gangster genre which had a wildly successful resurgence in popularity rivaling even the Westerns which had pretty much dominated the television airwaves during the same period... also were there, brilliantly backing up Steiger's Capone.",1383436800,2,1002,5.0606060606060606

It tells a bit about how he started out as a troubled child, how he worked his way up through the gangs, how he had to fight off the Irish mafia, how he gained control of his own gang, and then was finally brought to justice, and even a bit about his final years when he was released from prison.

392736,3,6301967968,"Review for the 1959 film Al Capone, not the documentary:

The Amazon reviewer hits the nail on the head: this film is really a Rod Steiger showcase. Watching this charismatic actor bring Capone to life, while occasionally chewing the scenery and spitting it back out at his on-screen enemies, makes for an intriguing two hours. Watch as Capone borrows a move from Shakespeare's Richard III and woos the distraught widow of a man whose death he was responsible for.

Unfortunately, Fay Spain (who looks a bit like Jolene Blalock here) gives a weak performance as the widow. For that matter, fine second-fiddle actors Martin Balsam and James Gregory don't really get to strut their stuff. That fault probably lies in part with the unimaginative screenplay and with the equally unimaginative direction. Witness the lame letdown of a conclusion for examples of both.

A mediocre movie with one great--or at least very interesting--performance.",1327104000,,939,5.1644736842105265
