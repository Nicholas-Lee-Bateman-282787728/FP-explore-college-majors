7928426,5,B00004ZBXW,"Sacha Baron Cohen has two classic characters - Ali G the rapping, malapropism dropping TV presenter from Staines in Britain and Bartok the interviewer from Kazakhstan TV.

Wonderful wonderful fun. Ali G is deliberately a ridiculous character, the best parts of these are when he interviews people like the FB Aiii - or Lady Chelsea on how to be polite.

Ali G asks the hard questions, like when will Animals get the vote, and why can't there get an animal parliament. He asks the drug expert are Class A drugs better. He asks the astronaut how difficult it is to hold your breath for 16 days. Asking moral rights experts if there is enough teenage pregnancy.

Bartok is great fun at an animal rights campaign where he tells them about how much he likes animals, he loves hunting bears. And how the TV programmes in Kazakhstan was about cats and dogs - they were well treated kept in a warm room, where the floor was so hot they jump around and dance.

British humour at its best",1144972800,2,978,4.508474576271187
