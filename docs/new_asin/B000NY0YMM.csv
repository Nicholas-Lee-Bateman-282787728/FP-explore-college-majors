8182369,5,B000NY0YMM,"The singer Yehoram Gaon is considered by many as an Israeli superstar with the stature of Frank Sinatra.  He writes, and directs this work with the incite and poetry of one who was born and bred in his country and loves it.  Here is an early movie of this man's long career which displays very much of the countryside and people during the middle of the 20th century. It is hard to deny the excellent talents of the writer, director and the value of his historical prospective. For those who love both history AND music it is wonderful!",1291766400,,536,4.459183673469388
8182370,5,B000NY0YMM,Excellent DVD!  I really enjoy listening to the Judeo-Spanish songs that Yehoram Gaon sings in this DVD.  It is so educational with lovely views of Israel.  It also has a historical explanation of Israel.  Five stars!!!,1273708800,,219,5.0
