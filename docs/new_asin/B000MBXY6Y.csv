2728053,5,B000MBXY6Y,"I had made it a rule never to buy DVD-R formats because I'm leery of the quality involved in ""burn on demand"" movies.  So I'm happy to report that the look of this movie transfer is stunning, no complaints there.  (I took the chance only because I really wanted a copy of this movie for my collection.)  I have no regrets.

As for the movie itself, in a word: fun.  Yes, it's dated even though futuristic (their bank of computers takes up an entire wall in their complex, couldn't they have foreseen the inevitability of miniaturization?).  This movie is colorful (literally and figuratively), the actors are all troopers in stock roles, the plot is standard for its type but moves along at a generous clip; it's oddly comforting in its familiarity.  And yes, by today's measure, it's quaint and perhaps a little nave.  But it's still good rousing wholesome fun.  Watching it again after so many decades is like meeting an old friend.  I'm surprised at how well I remembered key scenes (and the knowledge that Robert Wagner screams like a little girl only adds to the charm of this endeavor).  It's got it all: impending disaster, intrigue, a backstabbing brother, redemption, and H1-28!  (I still love that Pacifica reminds me of a giant pinball machine.)

This one goes into my collection with a grateful nod to those who saw fit to release it on DVD (DVD-R notwithstanding).",1312156800,16,1377,4.735294117647059
2728054,3,B000MBXY6Y,"Apart from the trailer, there is no bonus. There is not the French track, too bad!  But the delivery service was very good. Received quickly and in good condition.",1309478400,,163,4.620689655172414
2728055,5,B000MBXY6Y,"I bought this new from reseller blowitoutahere.  Was nervous about what the video quality would be for a WB Archives release but it was excellent.  Comparable to the quality of the ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"" TV series DVDs.  The original theatrical trailer was a nice bonus thought it's quality was more grainy but acceptable.  Generic chapter stops at 10 minute intervals, but that ok as well.

Pretty much a ""must have"" for Irwin Allen sci-fi fans.  Spotting all the recycled props from previous productions was more interesting than the plot of the movie itself.  This TV movie marked Allens transition from TV sci-fi to ""The Master of Disaster"".

The appearances of familiar faces from various IA productions (Basehart, Darren, Colbert, Whitman) were a nice touch.
I think Stuart Whitman and Rosemary Forsyth were having some sort of contest to see who could act the most grim.
Robert Wagner saves the film.",1307059200,5,918,4.915584415584416
2728056,4,B000MBXY6Y,"This TV movie was basically a recycling of Irwin Allen stories, characters, actors, soundtracks and props. There's Robert Colbert and James Darren from ""The Time Tunnel"" and Richard Basehart and Bob Dowdell from ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"". Sugar Ray Robinson had a cameo as well as Joseph Cotton. The Flying Sub, the Seaview, the Jupiter II as well as parts of the Time Tunnel were all there to see, not to mention the computers flats, the ray guns and the various bright monochrome jumpsuits. To top it all off, Robert Wagner was the ""Special Guest Star"" (just like Jonathan Harris or Kurt Kasznar). There were some Trek tie ins. Whit Bissell played a professor. John Meredyth Lucas wrote the screenplay.

Strange concepts abounded. First, a city beneath the sea was constructed in the mid-21st century. Such a project seems highly impractical as well as preposterously expensive. It's location was somewhere between California and Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean. There was also the idea that the gold in Fort Knox would be safer in the middle of the Pacific Ocean instead of Kentucky. Somehow an earth destroying asteroid snuck up on the earth and was only detected a matter of hours before impact.

However; all of this combined for great fun.",1284249600,4,1250,4.863849765258216

Irwin Allen was the writer, director & producer of this movie that stars the likes of Richard Basehart as the President and Robert Colbert, along with a slew of stars of that period...This movie is a must for those who collect Voyage to the bottom of the sea, lost in space, and the time tunnel.

2728058,4,B000MBXY6Y,"I saw this when I was a kid and have looked for an official version for years. It's a really good (for TV) science fiction movie from the early 1970's. Irwin Allen uses some of his cast from his earlier TV series which is nice.  Okay, some of the sets obviously look like models but it's still a fun movie from the ""Master of Disaster"" who, with this movie looked to be testing the waters so to speak for making his big screen disaster pictures later on. This burned on demand dvd may be as ""official"" as it's going to get. The picture and sound are decent, however there are no scene selection menus, and they only have chapter markers set at 10 minute intervals which is a practically useless feature. There is one extra, the original trailer for the movie.",1279843200,42,759,4.382978723404255

After years of unacceptable VHS and DVDs of this title, this Amazon DVD is quite good. It fills up the screen on the new large television screens without stretching, the clarity is better than when first brodcast. A great cast of Hollywood Who's Who is on board which helps, but the sets are what really send this film over the top. Irwin used practically everthing from the past productions on this show, yet in a fresh, vital and showstopping way. The color and style will keep you astonished. I guess that Irwin had planned to use this as a pilot for a new series which later didn't pencil out, yet he gave it his best shot.

Awful print but fun watching two fulk-blown alpha males strutting their stuff. Film is about sunken treasure. The issue with retrieving it is that the ship is on top of a taboo sunken city. And of course there's cross and double cross between the two guys that know where the ship is. The print is terrible but I  still had to watch. My favorite part is in the beginning when a representative of the insurance company introduces Woody Strode as his boy. Robert Ryan replies ""This is a BOY?""

From a historical perspective, it is interesting to see how the future was conceptualized in the early1970s. Women for the most part are glamorized secretaries and what was quite funny the nurses still wore white caps and uniforms. Two of the actors in the film James Darren and Robert Colbert co-starred in the Time Tunnel, several years earlier. It is still a fun Irwin Allen movie to enjoy.

AND, if that isn't enough there are thieves planning to steal the deadly stuff so they can be rich.  ANNND, if that isn't enough there are soap opera situations and personality mismatch's to keep the whole facility fully occupied.  The film is full of TV and 40's, 50's, and 60's film actors.  Allen re-uses some props from his earlier TV series and the sets aren't bad, if improbably roomy.  The best character is Dr. Aguila, a scientist who has been surgically altered to be amphibious.

2728088,4,B000MBXY6Y,"CITY BENEATH THE SEA is a 1971 made-for-television movie.  I was ten years old and I watched it on a black and white television.  I did not see it again, but the movie stayed with me: the man who could breathe underwater, the nuclear energy matter surrounded by gold, the looming planetoid on its collision course with earth.  And most particularly the city itself, Pacifica, encased in glass like a kaleidoscope pattern.  A few days ago I discovered it was available on DVD and I ordered it.

CITY is a made-on-demand DVD, a format about which I am not terribly enthusiastic.  I was greatly perturbed when the intro, a promotion for Warner Brothers Archives, was sticky.  Once I got past that and to the main menu, however, the DVD played without a glitch.  Most made-for-television movies of this era were not highly prized and therefore are not usually well preserved; surprisingly, this one looks good, sounds good, and I didn't notice anything greatly amiss.

The story is sci-fi clichs and hokum.  The movie is set in 2053.  Michael Matthews (Stuart Whitman) is recalled to military service by the President of the United States: there is a top secret issue involving Pacifica, the city beneath the sea that Matthews helped to build.  Matthews is not eager to return, for he was accused of deliberately causing the death of a colleague and city co-founder.  He is particularly blamed for this by the mans wife Lia (Rosemary Forsyth) and Commander Patterson (Robert Colbert.)  As the movie progresses, Matthews must deal with their dislikeand more particularly shipments of gold and nuclear matter being sent to Pacifica from Fort Knox in order to protect them from a series of earthquakes.  But no sooner are these materials at Pacifica than scientists discover the cause of the earthquakes: a planetoid is on a collision course with earth, and yes, you guessed it.  Its headed smack dab to Pacifica.

The movie was produced, co-written, and directed by Irwin Allen, who was best known in the 1960s for the television series VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA and LOST IN SPACE.  Allen was somewhat notoriously cheap, known for using stock footage and for recycling props, costumes, and setsand he does precisely that with CITY, borrowing footage from his series LAND OF THE GIANTS and making use of models originally created for VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA.  Even so, the overall look of the film is surprisingly attractive, and in many ways it is a time capsule of its era.  The art direction even makes use of the times color combinations of harvest gold, avocado green, burnt orange, and chocolate brown.  The costumes are also of their time.  The men wear jumpsuits, or attire that looks suspiciously like pajamas, or groovy duds including vests and bellbottoms.  The women, even those who are military officers, parade around in long sleeves, mini-skirts, and high heels.  Everything about the movie screams 1971.

The script does not give the cast a lot to work with, but they range from expert to adequate.  Whitman is always good, and both Burr DeBenning and Susana Miranda are memorable (and physically stunning) in supporting roles.  If you blink youll miss cameos by Joseph Cotton and Sugar Ray Robinson.  But the real prize goes to Robert Wagner, who brings an entertaining sleazy smugness to the role of Matthews treacherous brother.

So.  Is CITY BENEATH THE SEA going to win any awards?  No.  But I will say this.  Ive often returned to movies I saw as a child, and I am usually disappointed when I see them through mature eyes.  But that wasn't the case with CITY BENEATH THE SEA.  It is exactly as I recalled it.  Its a LOT of fun!

His understated and dispassionate acting set a tone for the character that made worse the directorial slow pacing of the movie. (Most of the action occurs occurs during the last half hour). He was not believable as the brother of the character played by Robert Wagner, who stole the show. An actor like William Shatner would have been perfect for the role Whitman played. Most of the action and dialog was made believable whenever Robert Wagner appeared. The movie is still worth seeing as a timepiece of what the world thought a future underwater city would be like - and simply nd because it was Irwin Allen's last(?)

2728116,4,B000MBXY6Y,"We're not talking High Art here.  This is a pseudo-science fiction offering that never even made it to theaters, in which producer/director Irwin Allen threw in everything from his burgeoning disaster-movie mindset (and a ton of leftovers from the prop closets for his small-screen brainchildren Lost in Space, Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, Time Tunnel, and others) to create a stew of silly but fun prop twists.  In much the way that his TV shows wound up being laughably improbable, in one movie we have a scientist/inventor/admiral returning to the undersea wonder he helped build, and was forced to leave after giving orders that killed a beloved fellow scientist (giving Rosemary Forsythe and Robert Colbert tons of unnecessary scenery-chewing opportunities); a submerged high-tech city that is about to become the repository for all the nation's gold bullion formerly at Fort Knox -- to be delivered by rockets, no less (yes, for some reason in the middle of the twenty-first century the U.S. has wound up back on the gold standard); a further need to stow the most dangerous fissionable material on Earth in the midst of all that gold, BECAUSE massive earthquakes are messing up all the dry-land facilities for the stuff, and the earthquakes are being caused by a gigantic asteroid on a collision course with earth.  Sheesh ... can't find the kitchen sink, but I know it's in there somewhere.

It's very early 70s, absolutely over-the-top, and all the intelligent, highly educated, highly capable women are showing as much leg as possible.  High technology means LOTS of blinking lights and switches, the bad guys are just psychotically evil ... they truly don't make 'em like this anymore.  And there may be a reason for that, but I confess, once in a while I'm just in the mood for this kind of romp around the space-opera soundstage that only Irwin Allen could really do.",1400025600,,1884,4.927444794952681

2728118,5,B000MBXY6Y,"This is a  pilot for a show that would have ended up being an Irwin Allen sci fi production. Irwin was the Gerry Anderson of American TV sci fi. There were a few shows, Lost in Space and Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea to name just two of them.
The movie is fun and not to be taken seriously at all. The acting is on par for a movie of the week production. .
The plot is full of holes but the fun is despite knowing that  you still keep on watching with that smile on your face. This type of movie is a perfect time filler and this one has very handsome sets good special effects and many well known faces from tv and the movies back then.
Overall good entertainment and very family friendly.

2728119,3,B000MBXY6Y,"I saw this movie (surely an Irwin Allen pilot that wasn't bought) when it originally aired in 1971. As a young teenager, I thought it was really cool. It was certainly filled with some of my TV favorites of the day: Stuart Whitman, Robert Wagner, Richard Basehart, Robert Colbert from Time Tunnel (and a brief appearance by James Darren too) and a few others.

The production crew came up with some very cool and colorful models, even if they did look suspiciously JUST like models LOL. The ""Flying Sub"" from his early series ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"" even made an appearance.

Unfortunately the story doesn't hold up that well for me now. The plot's own timetables are horribly mismanaged, and they even got simple science wrong (such as having Kentucky less tectonically stable than the Pacific Ocean floor). Radar not only shows camera quality pictures of its target, but also transfers the sound made by an object in soundless vacuum. LOL Of course that does make it more scary. ;-)

Pretty much everything is exaggerated, over-simplified, and factually and scientifically ... well ... wrong. But it is an attractive and mindless bit of fluff with some great colors and good looking actors. I enjoyed watching it again, even if I did make fun of it quite often ... and maybe for that reason. My wife, who had NOT seen this when it aired so long ago, kept giving me strange ""WHY are we watching this?"" looks. And that's even though she is also a big Robert Wagner fan.

So if you're in the mood for some pretty dumb Irwin Allen TV sci-fi, this is the ticket. It's not as good as ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"", but it's not NEARLY as bad as seasons two and three of ""Lost in Space"" either.

But just remember: If lots of people are walking back and forth briskly, or standing and intently watching older mainframe tape drives spinning, then IMPORTANT THINGS ARE GETTING DONE! :-)

The picture and sound are in great shape, and in fact looked perfect to me. Most TV film or tape from that era doesn't look anything as good as this does.

Cautiously recommended.",1390262400,3,2074,4.589189189189189
2728120,3,B000MBXY6Y,"Ridiculous pilot for an Irwin Allen television show that never made it.  It's a semi-spinoff of Allen's _Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea_.  Flying Sub alert!  It's old-school, tech-based mid-20th Century Sci-fi, but it's great fun, and the DVD offers an adequate copy of the film.  Worth the price of admission.  Enjoy.",1388361600,,319,4.943396226415095

2728123,5,B000MBXY6Y,"Irwin Allen was really captivated by the exploration of ""inner space,"" as the undersea projects of Jacques Cousteau and the US Navy were called in the 1960's, and this film is his supreme effort at his particular brand of exuberant futurism on the cheap.  It's got everything: zoomy rooftop executive suites, flying subs, undersea condo towers, cargo rockets.  Salted between the formulaic one-dimensional dialogue and direction (the cast is far better than what they're given to work with) are some of the grandest old-school visual effects ever made for TV.  The ""bigature"" of Pacifica, the City Beneath The Sea, must have filled an entire sound stage; there are visual cues to the undersea towers being larger than adult men!  Others have pointed out the many ""recycled"" props and costumes from other Irwin Allen projects.",1363564800,8,825,5.134328358208955

2728126,2,B000MBXY6Y,"I'm a real sucker for old, obscure science fiction movies. Of course, none of them are up to modern standards in terms of special effects. But neither are they ultra-violent, eye-stabbing, ear-splitting, bass-throbbing, blood-soaked, non-stop CGI spectacles of blazing lights, stygian darkness and spastic camera moves designed only for viewers afflicted with ADHD. In old sci-fi movies, most scenes last longer than a fraction of a second, and they have dialogue the viewer can actually hear and understand rather than being overwhelmed by the din of explosions or a blasting music track. What a concept!

Unfortunately, the 1971 made-for-TV movie ""City Beneath the Sea"" is a poor example of the genre. It has nothing to offer even for fans of old sci-fi. Most of the sets look like they're made of cardboard and papier mach. The special effects are bad even by the modest standards of the time. The plot is silly even for an Irwin Allen production. The actors spend most of their time walking around the sets like robots, reading their lines in monotones without any indications of caring or sparks of emotion. Even the casting is bad. Come on, now, Richard Basehart as the President, complete with a '70's-porn-star-style mustache? Give me a break!

""City Beneath the Sea"" fails so spectacularly on so many levels that I can't recommend it for any reason--with just one caveat. It IS marginally better than ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Starcrash/dp/B003NHMYHO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Starcrash</a>,"" so I rate it at two stars rather than one just to distinguish it from the worst of the worst. But my rating definitely is not a rousing endorsement. If I were you, I wouldn't waste my time or money on this stinker--just as I'm not going to waste any more time on this review.",1356307200,2,1823,5.2184300341296925

2728128,5,B000MBXY6Y,"Although the DVD quality was not as good as the Time Tunnel, it was very good. The variations in the Army Navy Fixed Special Equipment (AN-FSQ 7) flashing light early generation computer control consoles and reel to reel magnetic tape data storage units were just as impressive here as they were in the Time Tunnel Complex. Again, the starring female was not as beautiful as former Miss America Lee Meriwether, but she was quite attractive. Irwin Allen of course set this as a save the world from disaster movie that was quite realistic for that time. I'm suprised this movie is not rerun on cable or satellite tv.",1354492800,,614,4.694444444444445
2728129,5,B000MBXY6Y,I saw this movie when it first came out on TV and was enthralled.  Once I saw it a being on the market I had to get it for my DVD collection.  The supplier sent it on time and it was a very very good copy.,1352592000,,205,3.4347826086956523
2728130,2,B000MBXY6Y,"""City Beneath The Sea"" contains an interesting premise - an American city underneath the Pacific Ocean (appropriately named Pacifica) is a hotbed of intrigue, sabotage, and the potential impact point for an inbound asteroid.  Although it looks quite dated, that was part of the fun of watching this movie - to see what the future looked like through the eyes of Americans in the early 1970s.  For the nostalgia value alone, and special effects that were well before the age of CGI, the movie is worth spending some time on.

Unfortunately, I found the acting in the movie stiff and stilted, overall.  Stuart Whitman seemed to me like he would have rather have been anywhere else than pretending to be running any city, let alone one beneath the sea.  Robert Wagner, though, gives the movie a lift as its villain.  It's hard for me not to like Robert Wagner, whether he's playing suave and debonair or, as in this movie, cunning and conniving.  But everyone else just seems to be there to collect a paycheck.

""City Beneath The Sea"" is not the strongest entry in the late great Irwin Allen's body of work.  In fact, it's not as good to me as another made-for-TV flick he made late in his career, ""The Night The Bridge Fell Down"".  But I'd watch this again before being subjected to the likes of ""Bridesmaids"" and ""Pulp Fiction"".",1336089600,3,1327,4.656652360515022
