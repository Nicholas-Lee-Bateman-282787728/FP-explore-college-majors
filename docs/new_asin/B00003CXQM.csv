1289820,1,B00003CXQM,"This movie is definitely for kids or die hard D&D fans who are so blinded by their love of the game that they might actually like this film. For the rest of us, the movie is simply terrible. Not even Jeremy Irons, such a wonderful dynamic actor, portrayed a decent role in this film. This should have been a straight to video release. The story line is boring and the FX are merely so-so. Thank goodness I only spent $3.50 to see this movie because any more would have really enraged me. Finally, Wayans role in this film is merely ok as the comic relief. He fits in this movie like Dolly Parton's breasts do in a trainer bra. If you must see it, wait for it on video or DVD.",979603200,2,675,4.1603053435114505
1289821,1,B00003CXQM,"Other than Jeremy Irons' over-the-top performance as an evil wizard and some fairly elaborate sets, this absurd and unimaginative movie has absolutely nothing to recommend it.  Look, people, I wasn't expecting much when I settled into my seat to see a movie based on a role-playing game popular among pre-teens, but this sort of thing can, and often does, have a certain air-headed charm.  But this flick is just painful--lame dialogue, undistinguished acting, and one of those connect-the-dots storylines that just plod on and on.  Kids deserve better than movies like this.  Come to think of it, so do I.",979430400,,606,5.03
1289822,2,B00003CXQM,"The movie is so visually stimulating it is worth seeing.  The costumes and characters were great.  The story was ok and I even enjoyed it even thought the plot has said to have been weak.  The fight scenes were short (except for the end) but well done.  What I really was disappointed in was character development.  There was some, but not near enough for a game so bent on role playing.  The movie also fell so very short of each character class abilities.  The move had so much potential to really be great but instead fell short on directional effort.  I just wish I could have been a consultant for the game's sake.  It sold each character short of potential.  The main character being a thief I was so excited and anticipated some cool things, but the thieves in this movie could not even climb a wall.  Magnum PI could pick a lock better instead of using a ring of skeleton keys.  The main character and sidekick fell could have been extremely colorful but instead became dull.  I also got tired of seeing the mages cast the same spell over and over.  Any one who has an interest to see should definitely go, but don't expect much more then a great graphics, costumes, and effects.  I was very disappointed in the lack of story and character effort but I will definitely buy the movie.",979084800,,1291,4.457264957264957
1289823,4,B00003CXQM,"Shortly I loved it. Because I accidentially heard and watched it. I'm from the city where the film take place. It's Izmir in original but Izmer in the movie. They had changed the name a lot. &:-D I was looking forward to seeing a fantasy world -like the Tolkien's ones- before I watched it. But I just saw an Ottoman city which is synthessed a little with Byzantine architecture and SO UNfamilliar to a Turkish watcher, also an extremely weak plot. But i'm not regretful, because Zoe McLellan was really cute. I think she can be used more actively in the movie, so maybe she could be saviour of the film like the 'thief hero' was the saviour of Izmer...",977875200,,653,4.45
1289824,1,B00003CXQM,"I'm not sure what I was expecting, but the movie was less than impressive.  Its a classic example of how not to do a movie - no focus on the story and play up the special effects.  The special effects were good, but seemed to soak up so much of the budget that the sets and costumes looked like they were straight off of Zena.  The movie tried to do too many things - be sort of a fun, medieval knight movie like First Knight, a little bit of Star Wars, a little bit of Willow, and a little bit of Raiders of the Lost Ark.  I swore scenes were taken from all of these movies and thrown together to create Dungeons and Dragons.  There were also too many characters which didn't add to the story - they simply detracted from the main focus of the battle.  Lines are also misdelivered where lines that should make you cry or cheer end up making you laugh because they sound so pitiful.  I love movies and its not often I find one that I dislike so much...this  movie was my dungeon.",976752000,4,979,4.142857142857143
1289825,1,B00003CXQM,"Well, the trailer was great; unfortunately the trailer contained all the good stuff the movie had. Some effects are good, but plot is weak and has no connections to ""Dungeons & Dragons"" whatsoever. I would recommend fantasy fans see it when it would be available for rent. Don't make the same error I made; don't waste your money to see it in theaters or to buy it.",976579200,3,365,4.462686567164179

He is a mage lord seeking too control the kingdom. And too keep the common people in check. Meanwhile the princess wants everyone to live as equals.  A theaf learns  what it means to be a hero. While navigating his way through mazes and soldiers.  This movie is a must for fantasy flim fans,&fans of the D&D world. The movie eco's many others in story ,but is worth atleast one vist to the box office. It should be great on dvd.",976320000,,601,4.396396396396397
1289827,3,B00003CXQM,"I like playing RPG's, but D&D isn't really my cup of tea, so I can say that I'm not biased when writing this review.  Anyways, although I don't enjoy the paper and pencil game, I was looking forward to Dungeons and Dragons hoping for a good solid fantasy movie to let my imagination run wild, well, unfortunately that wasn't exactly what I got.
In the Empire of Izmer existed two social classes, the rich and powerful mages who rule on high and the poor lowly commoners that cannot wield magic.  The child empress Savina believes in her soul that everyone should live equally, but the council of mages fearing the changes that is coming with her reign, manipulated by the evil archmage Profion who wishes to control the power to summon the gold dragons, decided to order the empress to step down and give up her scepter.  A mixed group of adventurers were then recruited by the empress to find the Rod of Savrille, it has been told that this Rod will enable its holder to control red dragons, to help her expose Profion's cheme and trachery.
Well, D&D definitely had a lot of special effects, most of it were pretty good, but you realize a lot of them are cheap and not convicing looking at all, fortunately it wasn't often enough to ruin the experience.  The acting is a bit lacking, Jeremy Irons as the evil Profion was a little too intense that borderlines ridiculous.  Marlon Wayans provided the comedy relief as the thieve Snails, he managed to be funny without being overly annoying.  Thora Birch portrayed the Empress Savina, she did a good job with the little screen time she had.
Well, the bottom line is to keep your expectations low, I can't speak for those hardcore D&D gamers, but as a casual movie-goer this wasn't a bad time spent in the theater, I recommend going to the matinee show and be glad you saved a few dollars for next winter's Lord of the Rings.",976233600,12,1872,4.540059347181009
1289828,2,B00003CXQM,"<stream of consciousness review>
I had high hopes for this film but they were quickly dashed.  The dialogue was just horrible... truly horrendous... it was worse than Titanic's dialogue.  The acting was atrocious  with the only bright spots being Richard O'Brien (Rocky Horror's Riff Raff) and Tom Baker (Dr. Who).  Marlon Wayans put in a truly offensive performance of a Stepin Fetchit kind.  The main highlight was the Thieves' Guild maze sequence with the anti-Indiana Jones ending.  That was a nice touch, but the rest of the movie was pretty awful.  Thora Birch was particularly terrible with a performance that looked like she slept through.  I must admit it was amusing to watch Jeremy Irons, a great actor, suffer through such poor material, though.
I give this movie two stars, rather than one, because it might prove useful to make fun of with some friends, but if you have fond memories of playing D&D back in junior high school like I do, then this movie will disappoint.  Most of us could have put together a better script than this and included a half-way decent dungeon crawl.  I mean, geez, the movie is called DUNGEONS & Dragons, and there was only one really cheap and cheesy dungeon.

So what do you expect? None of us can take ourselves too seriously if we ever dreamed of being an elf prince, a barbarian maiden or a small human being with furry feet. Not every film is going to be an epic saga, and in this one I can tell the actors clearly had fun. And so did I.

Instead, just form your own movie in your own imagination, just like you've always done while playing the classic D & D role playing game, which is what the game is designed to do, essentially.  This Dungeons & Dragons (2000) movie fails on all levels - bad acting, bad editing, bad story, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad everything.  It's a special effects show, that's all it is.  It's also laughable in many ways.

1290206,4,B00003CXQM,"Well, to those who said it didn't have a plot must have been really wasted or asleep during viewing.
 I Wish they would have added some of those deleted scenes in, it would have explained things better.  I remember when seeing it at the theatre that I was confused at times which the deleted scenes would have fixed.  We need a decent directors cut.  One scene in particular when the elf and the dwarf did not accompany them to get the map back, why can't they go?  The ""they must do this by themselves"" bit made no sence.  At least they could have said ""that place is magically protected from all but humans"" or some such thing would work.  When Ridley went in to get the septre why was there a wall of force?  Well, in the deleted scene there was the information.  Only the person with the big ruby can go in.  The ruby being a magical key.  Character development was also left on the cutting room floor.  Normaly I would just re-edit in from deleted scenes, but lack of cgi on some deleted scenes kind of made it too much trouble.  It would have been nice to see a proper sequel.  The 2nd one had the bad guy come back after being dead.  Poor move.  Should have been the same cast or at least same characters looking for what happened to snails.  Maybe he was brought back to complete some quest, which on the surface could have looked evil and had to fight with old friends only to discover it was not.  Or the darth vader scenerio where he was brought back by some evil litch and had to overcome his own  evil side. (which we all have).  Plenty of story lines other than the sci-fi channel'ish B tv movie that we got.
  Over all a good movie with lots of decent special effects.  Just needed some of the deleted scenes and some more decent sequels.
  P.S.  The only D & D worth playing is the first ""advanced"" version.  They ruined the game in later versions.

This movie is very entertaining. It has both funny and serious moments, and the fantasy fight scenes are very cool. The film involves a group of adventurers who go on a quest to defeat an evil mage. The main heroes are Ridley, Snails, a female mage, a female elf, a dwarf, and an Empress.

1290384,2,B00003CXQM,"Dungeons and Dragons is the kind of theatrical release that you just cannot believe could make so many mistakes. The word that kept going through my head the entire time was Why. Why would Jeremy Irons, an accomplished actor, act in such a ridiculous exaggerated manner that it would make Rita Repulsa of Power Rangers wince in embarrassment? Why would the writers try and rip off the mind numbingly boring political backstory The Phantom Menace used one year prior? On that note why would they have Marlon Wayans play a character every bit as annoying as Jar Jar Binks? Why would Zoe McLellan be cast in such an important role when she doesn't even have the acting chops to run around convincingly?

Dungeons and Dragons had the unfortunate timing of coming out just 1 years prior to The Fellowship of the Ring, a movie that showed the world how to do fantasy right. Although the two movies were both made by New Line Cinema the differences are profound. The armor and weapons in this movie look like rubber, the green screening is unconvincing and the CGI is just horrific. When I think of D&D one of the first creatures that pops into my head are Beholders. These are rare, powerful and highly intelligent creatures. In this movie they act more like guard dogs and the CGI is so bad it just makes me wish they hadn't even been included. Fellowship of the Ring had a bigger budget ($93m vs $45m) and a year for advancements in technology  but those excuses simply do not come close to explaining the lightyears of differences in visuals. Plus, Fellowship almost assuredly had a bigger casting budget.

The fight choreography is amateurish, the music is bland and forgettable, the storyline plods along and the acting is often terrible.  The producers can't even figure out what their target audience is. D&D probably peaked in the late 70's and 80's which would put its biggest fans at around 30 years of age when this film came out but the film is clearly aimed towards children. Except that there are moments of gruesome violence and like The Phantom Menace the plot is overly complicated for a child.

So is there anything of redeeming quality in this film? Somehow Justin Whalin manages to retain his dignity throughout although I don't think this film helped his career.  Jeremy Irons cartoonish overacting is absolutely mesmerizing and the wizard Profion is a surprisingly competent villain. My favorite, however, was Bruce Payne as Damodar. Although Payne seems to be taking cues from Irons when it comes to overacting, I found myself enjoying the scenes with Damodar. Unfortunately the film continually shoots itself in the foot. Payne gives a decently emotional performance in one scene but he's paired up with Zoe McLellan whose leaden delivery kills any impact. In fact McLellan may be the single worst actress I have ever seen in a theatrical release of this size. She's certainly not terrible to look at but she spends the whole film with her eyes bugging out of her head delivering lines like she's reading them straight from the script.

As a usage of the D&D license this film is a waste. There are a few elements like the Beholders and a Lich and a whole bunch of Dragon's but it feels more like a cheap cash in. The group is rounded out with a Dwarf and Elf but they are so superfluous that their inclusion seems desperate.  They couldn't even bother to make the Dwarf short for God's sake. For me this movie wasn't as painful as say the 1998 Avengers movie or *Ugh* Battlefield Earth which was just a visual and aural nightmare but it could have been so much better. I think there was a kernel of potential but in the end it amounted to very little. I felt more sorry for the film than angry because there is a certain earnestness to it all.

Amazon had it for really cheap, so I figured I didn't have anything to lose.  I had not seen the movie prior to this.

A little bit about the kind of person this review is coming from....

For various reasons, I didn't get to play DnD in my early life.  Even when I came around to the world of Role Playing Games and the luxury of System Reference Documents, I decided that Chaosium's Basic Roleplaying System (BRP) was the best thing for the way my imagination is geared.  So I don't have an extensive history with Dungeons and Dragons as a game, nor do I have a great emotional attachment to the game.

So I came around to these two movies without much priming at all.

Well...

I am rather mystified at the caustic nature of the majority of the reviews.  I'm thinking there's a contest as to who can spit the hardest.  Or a standard of 'If it's not the best, it's the worst.""

Alright, I will admit that there was ONE thing that was very difficult for me to forgive, and it was the acting of the princess/empress/queenette/whoever-she-was.  But besides that....

Bruce Payne was top notch.  In both movies.  His acting may have been one of the things that saved the second movie in particular.

Justin Whalin was awesome as well.  I'm not acquainted with his career much, but his job as the character Ridley was fine by me.

Marlon Wayans also did very well as Snails.  The blurb over on RT that many saw his character as a racist stereotype was something that never crossed my mind.  Snails played an important role in the story that none of the other characters got to do.  Plus if I recall correctly, he was the first character to stand up to Damodar without a special artifact or ability.  Come on, people.

Jeremy Irons was overwhelmingly good as the psychotic magician Profion.  Every book derangement you expect from high-level wizards came out in his character.  In a good way.  I was reminded of a bit from The Hobbit where the text explained that mages are quick-tempered.

What was especially done well was the site selection for shooting.  The bone cathedral, the opera house, the other places, though being real-world sites, served the fantasy universe very well.  Solomon has a good eye for sets.

It's been observed that a song doesn't have to be over-produced to sound good.  The accusation that the movie is bad because the visuals aren't on par with DreamWorks is total bull.  The visuals do not make the story.  The story makes the story.  Even if THIS story is the standard quest for a powerful artifact to take down the bad guy, it's executed reasonably well.  Better than the majority of DnD fanboys out there could pull off.

Admit it, there's a certain comfort in a movie that carries some of the feel of a role-playing game.  The movie lands somewhere between a film and a LARP session among friends.  If it were otherwise, it would feel like a standard nondescript fantasy adventure that has little in common with the RPG scene.  Come on, didn't you see this movie to see how it would connect with the role-playing experience?

Since I've gotten the duel DVD, I've actually watched it over again several times.  I'm sure I will again.  And again.

So all in all, I like what Mr. Solomon has done here.  I'm sure it was very rewarding to see a childhood hobby brought to life so vividly.  If someone else tries to make a DnD movie, this movie will inevitably serve as a reference.

I'm happy with my purchase and it'll see it's share of use.",1325894400,2,3633,4.526964560862866

1290391,1,B00003CXQM,"Perpetually mind-numbing, ""Dungeons & Dragons"" is a cinematic attempt to drop a steaming pile on D&D franchise nostalgia.  Having very little to do with the games, it's a wonder the producers didn't at least get charged with larceny for this pathetic mishmash of action, drama, comedy, and love story.  How do I hate thee, let me count the ways...

First and foremost, the acting in this film is ludicrous.  Thora Birch as Empress Savina is everything Natalie Portman's character in Star Wars isn't.  In other words, just the bad parts.  Like boredom, incompetence, and naivety.  Justin Whalin is Ridley Freeborn, the primary protagonist, and let's just say there's a reason he's best known for his role in Child's Play 3.  Marlon Wayans is his fellow thief named Snails, a cowardly character inserted for comedic support; his presence and performance took black actors back a decade and serve as the reason he's only permitted to do Scary Movie sequels.  With how he helped ruin the GI Joe movie, I have to wonder if he hates a person from the 80s or the entire decade.  Not surprisingly, the best performance is turned in by Jeremy Irons.  All fire and brimstone, his screaming rage is convincingly directed at the opposing characters despite the probability of it actually being directed at his cast-mates.

The special effects are more short bus special than anything.  Video game CGI with cartoon dragons and painfully obvious green screen sword fights.  I'm talking choreography sub-par to Mighty Morphin Power Rangers garbage.  Dragons that could have been done better when D&D originally was released.

The screenplay.  Ugh.  Draws no viewer attention.  Banality at its finest.  If you're surprised that a team of assorted D&D characters (i.e. elf, dwarf, thief, etc.) must align and go on a grand mission where they suffer minor defeats on the way towards awkward love interests, corny one-liners, amalgamation, and eventual victory, then turn your head to look at your flat-lined EKG.

I'm utterly convinced this movie was conceived, organized, and made by those who protested D&D at one time or another for some ridiculous connection to devils and Satanism.",1308096000,2,2168,5.067796610169491

1290393,4,B00003CXQM,"Most reviewers don't seen to like this movie, but I found it both interesting and suspenseful, to say nothing of well supplied with perils, magic, and a good vivid background.  The new young Empress Savina (Thora Birch), with the idealism of youth, has resolved to make things better for *all* her people, not just the nobility and the mages who make up her Council.  But Profion (Jeremy Irons), a powerful mage who has been trying to gain control of the gold dragons (something confined so far to Savina, by virtue of her scepter), leads a parliamentary revolt against her.  Two young thieves, Ridley Freeborn (Justin Whalin) and his best friend Snails (Marlon Wayans), are attempting to burgle the mages' stronghold when they're discovered by Marina Pretensa (Zoe McLellan), a young apprentice mage and librarian who has just come into possession of a map that shows the way to an artifact that may be critical to Savina's cause.  The problem is that Profion knows about it too, and when he sends Damodar (Bruce Payne), his enforcer, to seize it, the three young people find themselves on the run and up to their necks in affairs beyond their control.  Allying with a dwarf (Lee Arenberg) and a tough elven Ranger (Kristen Wilson), they set off to follow the map, knowing that the only way they can stay alive--to say nothing of aiding the Empress--is to beat Damodar and Profion to their goal.  I thought the special effects rather good--especially the climactic battle between the gold and red dragons--and the costumes and scenery particularly nicely done.  In addition, Ridley and Snails' friendship is a core part of the story and supplies some of the funniest and most affecting scenes.  Of course this isn't D&D as TSR imaged it--maybe TSR should try filming their own game! (after all, they know it better than anyone else does)--but as a fantasy-adventure I found that it succeeded on its own terms.",1299801600,,1910,4.8734567901234565
1290492,1,B00003CXQM,"Take every cliche in the world of high fantasy, shove it in a blender with paper-doll characters and an incoherent plot, and add the most obnoxiously annoying sidekick who never said ""meesa"" and ""yousa.""

Yeah, this is one of THOSE movies, the movies that everyone says is one of the worst ever made, but you never quite believe it until you force yourself to sit through it. ""Dungeons and Dragons"" has more ham than a pig farm, ridiculously poor acting and more cliches than you can count (oh look, distracting the guards by throwing a rock!).

The evil mage Profion (Jeremy Irons) wants to overthrow the pure-hearted Empress (Thora Birch), and her only chance is to get the Rod of Savrille (it's French?) which controls red dragons. But the only scroll showing where the Rod is has fallen into the hands of a prissy young mage named Marina ((Zoe McLellan) and a couple of pathetic thieves, Ridley (Justin Whalin) and Snails (Marlon Wayans).

For some reason, they end up chasing after a mystical ruby that... is somehow connected to the rod, although I must have missed that part. They're also joined by a snooty elf in a metal cone bra and a sloppy dwarf, and being chased by Profion's evil blue-lipped minion, and must find the Rod first otherwise magic/the world will be destroyed, blah blah blah.

Pretty much every aspect of this movie seems as if it was dreamed up by a ten-year-old boy coming off an RPG bender, with a heavy dose of ""Star Wars"" as well.  But no, it was director/producer Courtney Solomon, who apparently was trying to make this movie as over-the-top and ridiculous as possible. Even worse: it's played straight.

So what does it have? Leaden direction, silly action scenes (how many times can Marina club someone with a torch?!), goofy CGI, silly costumes (shoulderpads of DOOM!) and a story that meanders along with random side-trips (Ridley has to run through a ridiculously easy maze). And the editing is so choppy that the characters seem to be teleporting.

And the script... dear Lord, the script. I want to set my own brain on fire when I hear the Empress' ""rousing"" speech to the Council. The dialogue from the villains is even worse: ""Give me what is mine!"" ""NEEEVVEEEERRRRR!"" ""You're as stubborn as your friend!""

And this movie contains two kinds of acting: wooden and hammy. There is no in-between, although a few actors (Kristen Wilson) actually manage to be both. Jeremy Irons (who needed this job for home renovations) apparently realizes that all hope is lost in the first scene, so he starts chewing scenery like a rabid wolverine. He's actually kind of fun to watch.

Sadly, nobody else is. Whalin is embarrassingly hammy as a bratty, self-absorbed thief, McLellan is actually fairly likable as a prissy mage, and Birch stands around in glittery costumes and talks in a bland monotone (in one scene, her eyes actually flick upwards as if she's thinking, ""How long until I get paid?""). Robert Miano also has a brief but hilarious role as a mage with a thick Bronx accent (""Do ya undastand the consequences of ya actions?"").

But Snails... oh man, Marlon Wayans will make you want to dig your brain out with a poniard. His character is annoying, screechy, whiny and borderline racist, and actually manages to be MORE annoying than Jar Jar Binks. Even the writers seem to have gotten tired of him.

""Dungeons and Dragons"" will drain your will to live with ghastly writing, acting, and direction. But if you watch it while drunk, that's another story...",1284508800,3,3493,4.785714285714286
1290493,1,B00003CXQM,"You are faced with an excess of very unrealistic-looking CGI. The whole of the Empress' castle, not to mention the entire city, all of the dragons, most of the weapons, the fantastic landscapes, all look somewhat less beautiful and less real than the average Larry Elmore Dragon cover. You have 10 weeks and $10 million to try to make them better. What do you do?

You miss, sorry, the THACO on this attack was 6 and you rolled a 4.

There is a screenplay before you, filled with gaping holes in the action (why are they suddenly in an empty forest at least twice? why is the female magician unable to use magic except when it's convenient? why is our callow hero, Ridley, so special and the only one who can complete this quest, ad infinitum) and some of the worst dialogue you've ever heard:

Norda: How old are you? Snails: Twenty-three. Yeah, I know I'm a little young for you, but what if I get my hands on an aging potion, huh? I'll sacrifice a couple of years for you. Norda: I'm two hundred and thirty-four.

Not to mention an ending that's beyond pathetic.

This one doesn't look too hard to beat, go ahead and give it a shot...oh, a swing and a miss. Sorry you rolled a 1, you only needed a 2.

The actors are as miserable as the screenplay, before you are Thora Birch, a petulant child spouting modern notions of equality; Justin Whalin, dull as dishwater and completely unconvincing as our ""chosen hero""; Lee Arenberg having no more conviction than most hyper 12-year olds that choose to play dwarven fighters; etc etc. Only Jeremy Irons seems to know what he's doing, and that's taking the money and running with it and having a fine time playing totally over-the-top - and totally off from everybody else.

Separate attacks please -- oh, miss miss miss miss miss...but you HIT on Irons; he's actually providing a good show!  He chews the scenery, he knows it's not serious for an instant.  Would that he could have imparted some of this to anyone else....

How about the director? This all-seeing beholder-type monster has put his foot in almost every action sequence, directing in the most unimaginative ways possible, and paraphrasing (that's a kind word for ""ripping off"") Indiana Jones more than once, most notably in an awful fight in the thieve's guild. This one should almost be as easy as the script to knock out...

Sorry. Another 1. Although if it makes you feel better, the THACO here was 4.

A bonus for you, intrepid dungeoneer. As you've persevered despite your horrible losses, I give you a bonus. It is the Marlon Wayans monster, AKA Stepin Fetchit for the D&D crowd. Whether he's whining about doing the dirty work, wailing like a stuck pig, or spouting (PG) urbanisms even more out of place than most of the rest of the dialogue in this turkey, good ol' Marlon gives one of the most solid Uncle Tom performances seen in ages. Yassuh, give him a shot.

It is a BAD movie. A heck of a lot of the acting is awful (the empress mostly), the scenes are hokey, the plot is generally predictable, and sometimes it flows poorly.

I enjoy watching it however. I own the movie, and it is perfect when I need comedy. It is still a pretty classic ""oh no evil wizard, lets save the empire!"" story, and it has humorous lines. The rogues are entertaining, and who doesn't like watching a drunken dwarf fail to ride a horse? The mage is fairly whiny, but that's expected of a spoiled brat.
The dragon animation is decent (for the time) and I always enjoy the end with the dragon um... having a little snack... at the end.

It is a cheap movie, but worth it for that price. Don't expect a lot, and you'll get plenty. Expect too much, and you'll be disappointed.",1276473600,,846,4.24223602484472

1290496,1,B00003CXQM,"It has been many years since I watched this travesty of a film, but even after thousands of competitors, I still find Dungeons & Dragons to be the worst film I have seen.  As a big fan of the D&D game (I grew up playing it for years) I had high hopes for the movie.  A budget of 35 Million dollars at the time was quite a lot of money, and Jeremy Irons is one of my favorite actors (for Irons at his best, try the original Brideshead Revisited miniseries).  It gives me no pleasure to pan the film, or Irons' performance in it, but there is just no other way... they just were both *terrible*.  With cheezy special effects, ridiculous dialogue and acting that is scary bad, you wind up with one big mess. My favorite line from Irons as Profion was ""I'm looking for my stone... I want my stone!""  You can imagine with dialogue like *that,* the actors did not have a chance.  Avoid at all cost.",1255046400,2,892,4.2176470588235295
1290497,1,B00003CXQM,"Despite the fact that I think this film rates lower than an otyugh's stool (D&D nerd reference there), I have seen it more times than I care to remember. I saw it once on a date at the cinema (she liked it), and a couple of times on video/dvd when I was trying to show just how horrible it was to friends. It is a film that gets worse with every viewing. There is always something new to be appalled by every time you watch it.

Do not own this movie, it will infect other movies you own with its badness. Even milk will go off in close proximity to this drek. If (like me) you are a completist and have to see it ""just to see what they did"", borrow it or hire it (but then complain that the disc wouldn't play on your machine so that you can exchange it for something else).

This movie commits the cardinal sin of being boring. It has a clunky script, questionable costume choices and as an adaptation of D&D, unforgivable. I know nothing about how to light a movie set, so when I notice that a scene has no atmosphere, there's something wrong.

The cast could or might be OK in other circumstances, but with rubbish lines and a bad director, are left to flounder. I don't think I've seen Thora Birch since. Jeremy Irons, rather than flounder, clearly went insane for the duration of this shoot. His performance is, ahhh... colourful. Olivier's Richard the Third on crack? X 1000?

The extras of this give a fairly good picture of why this film stinks. Yes, I watched them. The director's mummy bought him the director's chair, and he clearly shouldn't be trusted with sharp objects, let alone Jeremy Irons. Although the director professes a love of D&D, he clearly was never a dungeon master or ever read a fantasy book. And therein lies the problem with basing a film on D&D; the game is based on any number of sources and worlds, so what do you choose?

And where were the monsters? D&D if its about anything, is about the monsters! OK we had some 2nd drawer CGI dragons (they're a given), and a beholder very shyly ran across screen in one scene, but what about the rest?! Where were the gnolls, bugbears, gelatinous cubes (OK, they are silly), etc?

1290498,5,B00003CXQM,"Once upon a time in a land not so far away, a callow youth named Courtney Solomon had a dream. So he saved his pennies and at the tender age of 20, secured the film rights to DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, and thence pursued his Holy Grail: a big-screen version of the much-loved neo-medieval role-playing game. For 10 long years he wandered in the Holly Wood in search of the all-important Green Light, until one day he chanced upon the Lord of High Concepts (Sir Joel of the Silver). A meeting was taken and thence, ""a Courtney Solomon film"" was born.

Talented actors signed on for big paychecks, but now, so close to his dream, the novice filmmaker refused to allow his vision to pass into the hands of those more experienced, and he himself assumed the director's chair. Some $43 million later, he had his tale of the fair Empress of Izmer, whose rule is threatened by an evil mage, or magician. With the help of a dwarf, an elf, an apprentice mage and two thieves, disaster was averted . . . in Izmer. (Alas, the same can not be said of the tale itself, which stinketh like the breath of a dyspeptic dragon.) But for we collectors of BAD MOVIES WE LOVE, there is a happier ending.

Laboriously expository and defiantly incomprehensible, DUNGEONS & DRAGONS seems to involve the hunt for an enchanted ""rod,"" a threat to the prevailing ""fabric of magic,"" the fight for democracy in the kingdom of Izmer, and the ritual humiliation of actors. In ascending order of ignominy: haughty apprentice mage bland Zoe McLellan; Skywalkerish commoner Justin Whalin (the new Sean Patrick Flanery or the new Robert Sean Leonard? Discuss); his bumbling sidekick Marlon Wayans (a black character straight out of Hollywood's 1938 playbook); Glenn Close-channeling Jeremy Irons; and fair-minded empress Thora Birch, (who models a series of headpieces cribbed from '70s disco album sleeves and throughout sustains the impression of having learned her lines phonetically.)

Those schooled in the arcana of the phenomenally successful fantasy role playing game can best rule on whether Solomon's live action adaptation is a faithful depiction of its obsessive world of elves, dwarfs, and winged things, but even a babe in dungeonland can see that the leading fire breather in this malty brew of heroics and minutiae isn't a computer generated creature, but Jeremy Irons as the archvillain Profion. All goggle-eyes, exaggerated double takes and full-throated oratory, Irons howls, whispers and rages, as he struts about in Olivier's 'Hamlet' eyeliner. Luxuriously bellowing immortal lines like ''You! Are! Mine! Now!', he attacks and guzzles every shred of scenery as if he were playing King Lear at a suburban community theater. ""With a dragon army at my command I can crush the empress!"" he cries joyfully, bending at the waist and making little claws out of his hands. (It's Bad Movie Nirvana!)

As Irons henchman Damodar, Bruce Payne runs a close second. A bald and burly centurion, Payne goes through the movie wearing metallic blue lipstick, (an obvious but puzzling reference to Petula Clark), terrorizing heroes Whalin and Wayans, whose destiny is to save the world - or whatever. Aided by a lissome elf and a grumpy dwarf, our heroes embark on a quest involving glowing rubies and secret scrolls. With his long, chestnut lashes, cherubic cheeks and silky complexion, Justin Whalen is significantly prettier than his female love interest Zoe McLellan - the wholesome, magic-wielding librarian. Despite this obvious fact, McLellan decides to join them, and luckily, after she kisses Whalen her glasses disappear and her backswept math-girl hairdo is magically transformed into a hipper center-part. Our heroic group must battle Payne for possession of a powerful thingummy that can control red dragons, which may or may not be bigger and meaner than the regular green kind. The thingummy itself is called a ""rod,"" but strongly resembles my friend's old Dragon Bong. (A connection to the true Dungeons & Dragons universe at last!)

Comparisons to the LOTR trilogy are inevitable, so I'm not going to avoid it. I didn't really like the LOTR trilogy. It just seemed to be a bunch of movies that everyone was forced to like and if you didn't then there must be something wrong with you. Yes, they are much, much better made than the rather quaint D&D, but if you want a smaller, unassuming fantasy ride then don't completely rule this movie out.

The visual effects and production design of D&D are very similar to Paul Anderson's Mortal Kombat. Yes, it looks fake, but with just a little bit of suspension of disbelief you'll not even notice. I have a feeling that Courtney Solomon tried really hard to make it a good film but his talent doesn't extend as far as his enthusiasm.

In terms of character and story it is all pretty bland and generic. There's nothing in this movie that you haven't seen somewhere else. The actors do their best with the tepid dialogue and almost manage to not look embarrassed. The best thing about the film is it's surprisingly ferocious (maybe a bit too OTT) sound design. And the Dragon fight at the end was impressive for a medium budget film.

I was actually surprised to find Joel Silver's name on the closing credits. I will assume that without him the film would have been a REAL stinker. And what's with that ending?

Simple - the Dungeons and Dragons cartoon, which was by far the coolest cartoon of the 1980's. It smoked He-Man, Thundercats and any other contender and became one of THE best experiences of childhood. So while a movie based on the board game would have been cool, I was secretly hoping for a movie based on the cartoon. Come on - Hank and his flaming bow and arrow? Sarcastic Eric and his shield (you'd think the Dungeon Master would have thrown a SWORD in there too?), Bobby the Barbarian.. and let's not forget the uber bad-ass - Vengar himself. Let's face it folks - done right, it would have been AWESOME.

But we didn't get that - we got, well.. who knows? The plot is so incoherent and amateurish it could have been based on a game of Hungry, Hungry Hippo's. And whilst great acting is never the prime goal in these sorts of movies, special mention MUST go to the utter lack of any conviction the actors here have in their performances, coming across as just stepping out of a Snow White pantomime.

And then there's Jeremy Irons. Bit of a superb actor is our Jeremy, and I'm sure he thought at first he had signed up to a classy fantasy movie, thinking perhaps of Sir Alec Guiness in Star Wars. Then he read the script and saw the talentless monkeys he was working with and went full out into giving the worst performance of his entire career, not so much saying his lines as yelling them and spitting at the camera in an attempt to hide his embarrassment. Easily the best thing of the movie.

The producers obviously thought it was going to do well judging by its laughably hopeful ambiguous ending. Not a chance in hell, guys.  You had your chance and you blew it with this dragon turd of a film.

Stick with the boxset of the cartoon, and see how fantasy really SHOULD be presented.

There are several basic things about this movie that justify certain...flaws, as some would say.  Firstly, it obviously isn't meant to be taken entirely seriously...whatever the people who made it say, it isn't an analogy for real life, the villians are utterly evil, and the heroes utterly good.  Also, the dialogue is clearly very exagerated.  If pointless banter gets on your nerves, this is a bad movie for you.  The pointless banter, however, is a large part of a DND game, or at least, it is a certain interpretation of how a DND game goes.  Many things in this movie are like this.... the way the party works together, the way numerous solutions are creatively matched to a variety of problems are all the critical points of a DND adventure.  Bad writing is not the problem, if the writing was to be taken seriously and not over-the-top, it never would have made it into the movie, obviously.  The budget is too high to simply have gotten a terrible script and no one noticing.  Also, it is very creatively done in many parts, and showed a totally different view of DND than any I had taken previously.  My point in writing this is that to accuse the movie of being terrible because of cheesy writing is horribly unfair for basic reasons, and that the rest of the movie is strikingly like a DND adventure, with different skills being applied, party members showing varied personalities, and characters developing, albiet crappy characters compared to real DND characters, in my opinion anyway.  Nevertheless, I have made bad characters as a DM, and I understand completely.  I hope people give the movie a chance and try to appreciate how much effort and intelligence went into it.  Thank you.",1140393600,6,2089,4.623306233062331
1290591,3,B00003CXQM,"First of all don't think too bad of the film's effort. The D&D franchise had tons of film-wise interest in the 80s but the producers never accepted and then people stopped asking.

The director Courtney Soloman raised the money for this film all by himself which is pretty amazing considering the effects and rights to D&D.

The story had a good chance but it needs a serious injection of fast-paced filming and epic style camera work. These things would have improved the film. This and a little more seriousness from wayan's character mixed with a different ending (maybe the main character being knighted or something.)

But after going all out on the production and character design they decided to play it subtle. This film would have been better not subtle in the emotion of the story department.

The empire is in flux. The new empress wants equality for her people. But the scheming wizard (jeremy irons) wants to rule and so devises a plan to depose her and crush the empire under his boot.

Enter Ridley and Snails, two thieves just trying to get by in a city where those without magic are little more than servants. They decide to rob the magic school and get their big score, but when Jeremy Irons makes his move the two thieves, a young soceress and a disgruntled dwarf get caught up in the race to find a magic rod for the empress with dark soldiers on your heels or lose life and limp in the coup de'tat.

This film was expected to be better but if you don't take the possible ideas on board and just watch the film it is actually not a half bad movie.

Lets face it, after the build up, everyone would be going in ready to launch critisisms at this but rather than get an epic, they got a normal film and it shocked the life out of them.

Its worth a look. Watch it. But don't expect Lord of the Rings. Just go in and watch and see how you feel. You might be surprised.",1140393600,,1885,4.3810888252149
1290592,1,B00003CXQM,"It's a cliche to say any particular movie is the worst ever made.  I'm sure worse films have actually been produced.  I just cant think of them right now even after sitting here and trying for about 5 minutes.  To put it in perspective, the recent made for Sci Fi Channel movie ""Mansquito"" was a masterpiece compared to Dungeons and Dragons the movie.

Apparently some crackpot nobody guy wrote the screenplay and even directed this travesty of a film and was as much a genius at self-salesmanship as he an utter incompetent at filmcraft.  The blunders inherent here range from the systemic to the minutely technical.  In this one sense, at least, the film is consistent.  The casting is awful, the acting atrocious, the writing is phenomenally bad.  The sets and costumes rest uneasily in that wretched zone between camp and simply inept.

And then there is the plot.  Of course, the scale of the drama is truly grand, the writers were not afraid to embrace the tired cliche of every bad fantasy novel, of the unlikely band of heroes tasked to save the Universe and face the ULTIMATE MENACE.  Yet the plot frequently stumbles down even this well worn path, as each scene seems more jarringly unlikely and hackneyed than the one before it, to the point that one quickly loses any sense that there is a plot at all.

By contrast, even basic Dungeon-crawls can actually make for pretty interesting and dramatic stories.  In fact, I think this is where a lot of D&D fans were really let down.  Even if only due to the random element introduced by the dice, the twists and turns of a reasonably good rpg session can be far more nuanced and interesting than your typical fantasy movie or TV series.

I think most people who have played an RPG at one time or another have thought of this, perhaps leading to the greatest hope that was dashed by this incredibly bad film: a real D&D game could probably have been the basis for quite a good plot.  But this movie bore little if any resemblance to even the most hackneyed D&D game ever played by anybody over the age of puberty, and rather than advancing the fantasy genre forward, it definately took it several steps back.

On a more technical level, the completely ridiculous props and costumes which would have raised eyebrows in an Ed Wood film don't help much in the suspension of disbelief department, and the very clunky CGI rounded out the general feeling of complete disconnect.

Even if you are the sort of person who likes almost any kind of science fiction or fantasy fare, avoid this, it will leave a bad taste in your mouth.  This is quite simply one of those films you just can't go along with no matter how much you might want to.  It's worse than the Postman, or Waterworld, or the worst Xena episode you ever saw.  I'm only giving it one star because I can't give it zero or negative stars.  I would actually for the record prefer to give this negative 5 stars.

This is another classic blunder of marketing by WOTC, which goes back to earlier PR efforts in the history of the game and it's previous owners (TSR).  Once again they managed to make their fairly interesting game look completely stupid, following in a noble tradition including a really bad cartoon series or two and going all the way back to the botched 60 minutes interview where the reasonably benign Gary Gygax somehow came across like Charlie Manson.  I'm certain they could not have done a worse job of marketing this game to the mainstream if that was their original plan.  I guess the question is: what is their plan?",1139788800,3,3548,4.583201267828843
1290593,3,B00003CXQM,"So this was the long awaited (and long overdue) Dungeons and Dragons movie...  An attempt to depose the young empress, Savina, is made by an evil power-hungry mage, Profion, and his henchman, Damodar (the latter we see again in the sequel: D&D Wrath of the Dragon God-Elemental Might).  In an effort to save the kingdom of Izmer, an adventuring party is formed consisting of two thieves, a mage, and a dwarf.

On the positive side:

1) The plot as a whole was not bad at all; it was an interesting story, which included some fascinating artifacts, such as scepters and rods, with the power to control Gold Dragons and Red Dragons respectively.

2) Overall, the special effects were pretty good.  The beholder, the dragons, and the final battle over the city were quite enjoyable.

On the negative side:

1) The benevolent empress, the evil wizard, and the attempted coup d'etat, had Star Wars written all over it.  There is so much originality in this AMAZING game called D&D that the last thing one needs to do is ""borrow"" themes from others!

2) The choice of actors and the acting itself were way below average to say the least.

Marlon Wayans in a Dungeons and Dragons movie... Should I say more?

The orange-haired dwarf was just sad.  His general appearance, his poor accent, and his choice of lines were pathetic.

To call Jeremy Irons' role ""limited"" would be an understatement; it's more like non-existent.  He is the movie's ""heavy artillery"" and he doesn't have more than 10 minutes on screen.  It's ridiculous.

Neither Damodar nor his blue lipstick seemed to belong in this movie.

As for the actress playing the elf, had she read any Tolkien or D&D novels prior to attempting to play her character?

In short, the cast is badly in need of acting lessons!

3) The dialogues were way below average.  Why? The writers should know...

4) Most of the creatures encountered throughout the movie were out of a Star Wars or Star Trek universe and not a D&D world.  What is wrong with these people?  Last time I checked there were plenty of entries in all the D&D Monster Manuals that have been published over the years.

The film would have been so much better if the actors could act and if the writers/director had the ability to... write and direct!  A shame really...

I have to say that I was more than a little disappointed with what seemed to be a parody of Dungeons and Dragons, mocking all those who love the game and scaring away those who might otherwise have developed an interest.  SHAME!  If moronic shows like Xena and Hercules have fans (!!!), if Harry Potter and Narnia books can be turned into blockbuster movies, then D&D's Forgotten Realms-Dragonlance best-selling novels and Greyhawk adventures should really take off no problem (that is if the work is done properly).

In a nutshell, if you keep your expectations low, it might provide for an evening's entertainment, and that's about it. 2 Stars",1136073600,2,2924,4.721343873517786

1290695,1,B00003CXQM,"I have to say this is pretty much the worst movie ever made (that is, if anyone can even know that).

Like many modern stories, it presents us not with some kind of moral quagmire to work through, but rather a power struggle in good Marxist tradition between the pampered aristocratic mages and the economically-oppressed, yet innocent common folk (after all, if there is no objective morality, everything reduces to power).

Instead of a hero character - a noble person with a flaw - we get the typical modern anti-hero who is by trade a robber who becomes plagued by accidental noble deeds for no reason.  At his side is the token black guy (who is harmless of course, a la ""Webster"") serving as comic relief and who's jokes are actually the only redeeming part of the movie.  They're artificially teamed up with the token love-interest in the form of a mage librarian girl or something for no reason.  The dynamic between the three is taken right out of an episode of Blossom where giggly teenagers are flirt-fighting, and the girl ends up taking her place as window dressing.

They're chased (again, the 'chase' factor is a necessity in the modern power-struggle story; WHY they're chased is merely incidental) by a guy with - I am not making this up - purple lipstick on.  Honestly though, I'd be freaked out if some magical sword-wielding metrosexual was slowly walking after me.  And I do mean SLOW.  For some reason our culture thinks there's some correlation between a guy's 'coolness' and the speed he moves.  Well, imagine how goofy it looks when he's leaving in the middle of a battle scene or 'chasing' someone who's running when he's only moving about 100yards/hour.  I won't even go into the snakes? put into his head it was so bizarre.

On the other side we have a 12-year old Empress (resembling an older version of the Empress from Neverending Story with putty on her face) who really `feels from the depths of her being' that all should be equal for no reason.  I can hear Monty Python now: ""Listen, strange putty-faced children playing with dragons and telling us about their feelings is no basis for a system of government"".  Go to your room little girl.  Yes, despite what anti-intellectual Hollywood thinks, we actually need ADULTS with principled, thought-out REASONS in order to successfully run nations.

At least we got a lovely New Age pantheistic ending where everyone became one with the Force for no reason.  Almost as lovely as when it was in ""Powder"".  Save your time and go watch LOTR again.  This movie will soil you.",1131926400,13,2552,4.733031674208145
1290696,1,B00003CXQM,"...but it's hard to find much positive to say about this movie. Jeremy Irons must have needed the money, but at least he gurns his way through this in a professional fashion; his sidekick can at least do vaguely menacing, although it must have been hard not to giggle when the blue lipstick went on.

The lead characters are drawn with all the subtlety one would expect of a man who has been allowed to write the script with red crayons on the back of some old wallpaper. They are by turns, appallingly naff and simply appalling. Marlon Wayans manages a new low in eye-rolling sidekickness. When one 'hero' is thrown from a tower by a blue-lipsticked villain, I found myself cheering for the Forces of Darkness.

However, if bad movies are your thing, there are bits to savour and enjoy: Tom Baker's wonderful slice of ham as the Elf King (surely the lardiest elf in the history of the world!) and Richard O'Brien's splendidly camp performance as the master of the Thieves' Guild are there to treasure.

1290697,3,B00003CXQM,"""Dungeons and Dragons"" isn't a great movie, but despite the complaints you'll hear about it, it's certainly not the worst of a lackluster genre.

OK, the sound man should be flogged -- I couldn't understand a word in either the beginning or ending segments with the dragons -- and the script needed to be something beyond a first draft, with recognizable motivations, less exposition and decent dialogue added. And someone wake Thora Birch up: She seems to have slipped into some sort of sleepwalking coma.

Having said that, the ""Dungeons & Dragons"" movie wasn't as horrible as I'd heard it made out to be. It was surely better than ""Krull"" or ""The Sword and the Sorcerer."" I'd rank it right below ""Willow"" and around the level of ""Dragonheart"": amateurish, kind of cheesy, but not offensively so.

There was some neat stuff in the movie. Well, neatish. Many of the characters, most notably Ridley certainly looked the part, and the computer-generated capital city was pretty excellent in all the pointlessly fast flyby shots. And I thought the dungeon sequences were handled reasonably well.

Courtney Solomon put ""Dungeons & Dragons"" together without the benefit of a real grounding in film, other than ""parents in the film industry,"" which qualifies him to work at Starbucks, honestly. And it shows. But the film, if clumsy, also shows a real love of the source material that redeems most of its flaws.

You want to see a really bad fantasy movie? Check out ""First Knight."" Compared to that, this is Shakespeare.

1290698,3,B00003CXQM,"For something as popular as D&D, you'd think they'd strive to make it a better movie.

Problems:

-One of the worst scripts ever written for a film.

-SNAILS DIES!!!!!!!!!!!!!

-The idea of the Elves is shallow.

-For a movie made in 2000, the obvious CGI was dispicable.

-There were many scenes that could have been cut in favor of some of the Deleted Scenes, like Ridley's vision (the birth of the Dragon), and the events inside the map that Ridley and Marina are sucked into.

-With the exception of Snails, the acting was pretty crappy.

-The story was cliche, overdone, and moved way to quickly to be developed correctly.

The Upshots (and why I give it three stars):

-Snails.  He gets two stars.  Marlon Wayan was incredible in that role.  Snails is my favorite movie character, because he was funny, ingenious, and the best character in the whole film.  My opinion of the movie lowered incredibly when Damodar killed Snails.  He was awesome, and should have lived.

-The Dragons get the other star.  Granted, they were obviously CGI at times, but they were very, very cool.  And I love when Profion is about to hurt the Queen, and the giant head of one of her dragons comes up behind Profion and eats him.  That was just awesome.

Truthfully, I wanted to be able to rate this movie higher, but I just couldn't.  Snails gets two stars, and the dragons get one, so all I can say is 3 stars.  Don't waste your money buying it.

This is what happens when you hand $35 million to some loser with no talent or training. Apparently, according to him in the DVD making of feature, he reckoned he'd learn more from making a movie than from staying at film school. I guess he was wrong about that.",1123804800,5,491,4.212765957446808
1290701,3,B00003CXQM,"This reviewer is one who has never played the D&D game. So I didn't have much of an idea what to expect from the movie. Thankfully, it isn't too hard for a non-D&D fan to understand. But I found the film to be much too mediocre and basically another stack of cliches, useful only to satisfy a friday-night spot for an adventure flick.

I can't recall much of the exact storyline, as I drifted in and out of day-dream-land during most of the movie (yes, it can be somewhat boring). But I can assure you, the basic plot is all too familiar. Cutting it down to the essentials, there is something worth a lot of power (and also alot of money, depending on what your interest is) that both the good guys and the bad guys want, and predictable enough, they must race against time as well as each other to obtain it. Among all of the cheesy adventure antics that remind me of a sc-fi-channel original series, there is also a love story that evolves throughout the film (as if that would be unexpected).

The acting is -- as most reviewers have pointed out -- quite distracting because of obvious lack of either acting talent or director talent (but no matter whose fault, there's no reason to point fingers, because they probably all were equal contributors to it's cheesiness). Most scenes will make you cringe with cliche action-movie lines and pathetic attempts at showing the character's emotion. But, before long, I found myself adapting to the corny world of the movie and it didn't distract me as much. Dungeons and Dragons is actually a decent fantasy flick if you can just train yourself to ignore it's overflow of cheesiness. One move D&D successfully executed was adding in plenty of humor. The terrible acting seemed a little more at home because the film in general takes itself quite lightly.

But one negative thing is for sure worth mentioning, and that is the fact that dragon fans will be disappointed. This movie focuses much more on the people than the monsters -- especially excluding the dragons. The obviously CGI-constructed dragons only appear at the very beginning of the film and a few shots in the last 15 minutes of the film. I'm not going to take shame in it, I'm a fan of dragons. No matter the age, dragons are a dark and fantastic treat to see on the screen. But I must warn those who haven't seen it that, while the story line can revolve around them at times, the actual involvement of dragons is scarce.

As far as DVD features go, there are some deleted scenes and step-by-step demonstrations on the CGI construction of the few parts the dragons are included, but not much to jump up and dance about. The best feature would have to be the documentary on fantasy games (mostly, of course, having to do with D&D).

Overall, D&D is a very average corny fantasy/adventure flick that is definately only worth rental money. If you want an interesting storyline and more dragon-time on screen, you'll have to look someplace else.

Well, I've never been so intricately close to D&D that I would have been labeled a sinner in the 80s, but I have ALWAYS loved medieval fantasy, and many of the D&D stories and characters. So, I had the feeling going to the film that I would have a good old popcorn munching time with one of my favorite genres. No decent movies about medieval times had come out in a while, so what better than D&D to end the drought?

Well, I left the theater laughing. Not at the movie, but at myself for having such high hopes. It had potential, I'll say that. I chuckled at a joke or two, I liked some of feel, like magicians and thieves and whatnot. But in the end, it felt like a washed out, Lord of the Rings lite. And who would have known that LOTR would indeed come out a year later and absolutely blow everyone's socks off?

The main problem with D&D is its basic plot. Several characters band together to retrieve a magical item and defeat the wizard. Ok, sounds fair. But the characters are so wooden and stereotypical, I just didn't care. The thieves are rebels who believe in justice and equality. The wizards are old and power hungry. The dwarf likes beer and fights. The elves are delicate and mysterious. And that's about the most we get to know anybody, although the main two characters (thieves) get more screen time and somewhat anachronistic dialogue. I admit I was surprised by a death halfway through, and surprised again at what happened / didn't happen with the dead at the end of the film. But outside of that, it's pretty stock stuff. And don't look for Jeremy Irons to save the film, he overacts here with the best of them. Although I did enjoy his last scene or two involving his magic and the dragon battle.

I guess bottom line is that it's worth a see if you're a real D&D or fantasy fan, but other than that, it's not that great, and if you've seen Lord of the Rings by then you've already seen better. Just too bland.",1112054400,,2144,4.312655086848635

Boring, boring, boring... I wanted to like it, but it wasn't really gelling with my concept of what a D&D film would be like. Heck, the old D&D cartoon was better than this, and not as goofy.
I've always felt that it was some sort of rush job, because the LOTR films were being made at that time and someone wanted to beat Peter Jackson to the goal line by releasing a mainstream  fantasy film.

Being a fan of sci-fi and fantasy, I was always aware of D&D, but never pursued any interest any it.  Having said that, I was surprised at how decent this movie really was.  Granted, there are a ton of films that are a lot better than this fantasy flick, but it was a nice way to kill a little time on a Saturday morning.  There were some good and some bad things about this film.  Here's a look at all of them.

First of all, the guts of this story were very good.  The tale of two thieves and their cohorts seeking out a powerful sceptor has been told before, but it is played out very well in this movie.  It's plays out at a rather quick pace and never gets boring.  Justin Whalin, Marlon Wayans, and their group are all excellent in this film.  Bruce Payne was also a perfect foil to their plans.  I actually felt a little sorry for his character.

The special effects were okay considering the massive amount used in this picture.  They don't take away from the story at all.  The battle of the dragons was done pretty good, though I wish we would have been given a larger dose of the action.

It was very nice to see Tom Baker on the screen.  Fans of the BBC series ""Doctor Who"" will remember him as the beloved fourth Doctor.  I'll be honest and say that I didn't recognize him initially, but when I realized who he was, it felt good to see him once again.

The movie gets pretty ugly when, unfortunately, Jeremy Irons or Thora Birch enters the frame.  Irons seems to be overacting in an attempt to be the dreaded nemesis he is supposed to be.  It's funny how sometimes Irons can be such a brilliant bad guy, and then stumble his way through a film such as this or ""The Time Machine.""  Birch is completely out of character in this movie.  She is such a good actress in her other films(American Beauty, Ghost World, etc.), but she doesn't seem to be able to grasp the character she is playing.  I would think that such a radical character would have been played with more emotion, or at least some emotion.  The ending is abrupt and uneventful.  Sure, the bad guy gets his in the end, but the ending only serves as a point to quickly shut the movie down.

Once again, the real story, the better story, is between Whalin, his friends, and the character portrayed by Bruce Payne.  Had they been the entire focus of the film, it probably would have been much better.

I am a true DND nerd. I have played for years and know every subtle nuance of the game. And the director/writers of this film clearly never even saw DND in action.
All the characters were bumbeling morons, the scenes from the movie looked like cheap star wars rip offs. They took classic DND monsters and totally rewrote the entire concept behind them. I was left unfulfilled from moment 1. The magic in the movie was stupid, everyone used ""magic dust"". There were no cool spell incantations. Just loud unrememberable music. I found myself routing for the bad guys to hope they kill the heros (Especially Marlin Wayans). The fights were bad, the plot was bad. Any true DND player will despise this film.

I heard it was bad... I fully expected awful... but no, oh no... I was still not prepared for the load of crap this movie dished out.
Special effects?  Whatever.  The effects were cheesy and you can tell all the money was poured into the final scene with the dragons circling the city.  There's one random character that keeps flicking his tongue out - I imagine a computer generated serpentine tongue was supposed to be added, but the movie makers left it untouched, and now you have some goofy looking guy sticking out his tongue now and then.  I'm laughing just thinking of how stupid it was.
Anyway, don't expect plot, acting or continuity.  Where did the Dwarf come from?  I don't think it was even explained... and he surely has no reason to join our band of idiot adventurers.

There is no joy in this movie whatsoever. Well, the villain was pretty hilarious on occasion, but not frequently enough to make this anywhere near bearable.

1290905,3,B00003CXQM,"To preface this review - this movie is awful.  The acting doesn't leave something to be desired, it's simply laughable.  The storyline is predictable.  So, why the 3?
The story is ""classically silly"".  You get silly things like a Dwarf that's always angry, an elf who thinks she's someone special, a young sorceress who is high and snooty, and a pair of thieves who are completely clueless.
Combine this with scenes which are actually kind of cool - like in the Den of Thieves where he's going through all sorts of traps, and you end up with something that's one one hand sickening to the stomach and on the other a laugh riot.
The negative reacton to this movie comes primarially from people who had high expectations.  In an era where superhero movies were being released that didn't stink, special effects were becoming amazing, and D&D had recently made a revival - it's obvious why people expected this to be great!  The movie also had a pretty good trailer...
But then you get Jeremy Irons who played the evil wizard.  While it's conceivable that a wizard this annoyingly stupid exists, it's hard to suspend disbelief.  Then you've got the child empress.  Okay first off, kids in leadership roles don't mess with modern ideals.  So you give us a cheesy evil wizard opposed by a child empress whose morality far exceeds her time.  Kids her age would be more likely to be yelling ""off with her head, she stepped on dolly"" than discussing the necessity of freedom for all.  And the props look like cheap plastic toys.
But all in all, if watched with the perspective of ""humor value"" it offers a bit of value in a ""cult classic"" sort of way.  I'll watch it about once a decade but do not consider it an unwise purchase.",1076889600,3,1721,4.584967320261438

Where to start. The acting. I cringe at the acting. The characters were completely stereotypical that it hurt, I didn't even bother to know their names. You take one look at the character and almost immediately you know what their purpose in the movie is. It's true: hero, magic girl, Scottish dwarf, (dark-skinned?) elf, child-like Empress, bad guy... and the list goes on and on.
Next, the plot. Did ANYONE bother to look at the plot? Or the music? Or the overall movie? It felt like a cut-and-paste of other movies such as Star Wars, Indiana Jones, LOTR, etc. I couldn't find a single line of originality at all.
Overall? I laughed at the movie in good humour. Yes, I think it was a rather poor movie, but it was greatly amusing to watch. That is, if you like to point out all the flaws and then guess who's going to die next. (oh, oh, oh! It has to be the best friend! It HAS to be... then the hero will go into an uncontrolled rage and kill the bad guy!!!) Wait, did I just spoil the movie for you? Sorry. But let's not forget the ""war"" storyline as well, the hero's quest would have been in vain without a purpose, right? Geez, I could have plotted out the whole movie with my eyes closed, having only their dialogue to listen to.
Yeah. Good for laughs. Bad for a movie.",1073433600,6,1549,4.201342281879195
1291027,1,B00003CXQM,"This movie is neither creative nor thought-provoking, all because it's not an original idea. It's just this big copy of different fictional masterpieces that have come together to create a catastrophe! They just mixed TV shows in together namely Crystal maze and Xena Warrior Princess. They really tried to copy Tomb Raider's (the game) levels only insulting the artists that created the game with their pathetic attempt to make a great fantasy flick! They tried to make such a great Star Wars kind-of-movie only to make a disaster of the cinema industry. They had would-be light saber fights and even this weird podrace. The costumes and the sets make this statement even more obvious!

  The make-up was horrible. The lighting was terrible and it ruined one of the only good things about this feature-the cinematography! And what's with the colours? Most of the film was dull green, red, and orange in color (sets, costumes)! The costumes were another thing that needed professional help. What happens when the costumes from ""Star Wars Episode I"" meet ""The Lost World""? A nuclear meltdown- a fiasco, also known as ""Dungeons and Dragons""!

  They could have made such a good movie because the title is pretty good. It sounds like something you'd want to see but you realize that it's really not something you'd want to see, 4 minutes into the movie. Worst scenes were the ones with the main characters. In the DVD special feature option, the alternate ending the director decided not to use was a whole lot better and more realistic than the surreal so-called surprising ending he decided to use! The deleted scenes in the DVD were the best scenes in the movie- some of them were actually okay (but not amusing enough to make me laugh). I would call this a kiddy movie but I would just be insulting and embarrassing the kids around the world!

  I shouldn't forget the sound. The sound-editing was hopeless, i.e. it can't be fixed (it was that bad). As for the score, the crew don't know what musical sequence they are supposed to use. When someone dies this cheerful score starts in the background with fanfares and chimes!

  If you really want to know, the plot revolves around this empress that needs to use these scrolls so she can find this thing to control these fake red dragons but the bad guy also wants it. So her mentor's librarian and two commoners help her find it in one of cinematic history's most disappointing adventures! Some war! My sister's fights with me last longer than that! One of the best things about this movie was that it ended so quickly!

  Who wrote this? The script-every line in the script was messed up. Either they computer didn't print the script out properly or the writers are just plain bad! They're untalented and can't distinguish between good and bad. But there was one thing I really liked and appreciated! The font they used for the ending credits was fascinating!

  Now let's look at the cast! Jeremy Irons (Propion)-word of advice, stick to doing voices like Scar's in ""The Lion King"" because this may be news to you but you can't act! Thora Birch (The Empress), I can barely hear your soft whispery voice but it really doesn't matter because you really don't have anything important to say. You try to dress like Queen Amidala but you will forever offend her. Your speeches are uninspiring, tedious, simple, and completely pointless! You tried so hard to become the next Queen Amidala and I pity you, I really do. You acted so badly that I couldn't even laugh at you! Your speeches are so memorable- I'll never forget how stupid and uncalled for  they all were! They were the exact opposite of Al Pacino's speech at the end of ""Scent Of A Woman"".  As for you Zoe McLellan (Marina), you need acting lessons like the rest of the cast. I have yet to spot a scene where you don't have this traumatized and puzzled expression on your face! But Kristin Wilson (Norda) is one person I feel really bad for. She was the only person that gave a reasonably good acting performance. Unfortunately for Wilson, the whole movie was stupid.  As for the movie's main character, Justin Whalin- you should really stick to TV shows because you don't know how to act and your performance was laughable. At least Scary Movie's Shorty (Marlon Wayans) did what he does best. Acts mad! As for Bruce Payne (Damodar), you're a payne in the ***! First question: ""What is with you and that blue fluorescent lipstick?"" Question #2: ""Are you really this lifeless in real life?"" You sound like you have a thousand frogs stuck in his throat!

  The movie was a mixture of dim-witted characters that were just wannabes of other famous characters. The characters tried to imitate Xena, Queen Amidala, Darth Vader, Lara Croft, Hercules, The Amazons, and Indiana Jones among others, only to fail miserably! The cast can't even cry. The tears were so phony, it would have been more realistic if they drained an ocean and splashed their faces with water to form tears. Even the laughs are fake, they sounded like the ones Dr. Evil's crew do in Austin Powers (and they have an excuse because they're supposed to sound fake). In short, this is the worst cast ensemble in the history of motion pictures! Everyone's (except Kristin Wilson) acting was so awful that it was upsetting. Did the casting people actually hold auditions for this movie or did they just pull people off the streets?

  This movie is so unbelievably surprising (not in a good way) that it would be the Oscars' worst nightmare but the Raspberries' dream come true! The D&D crew did a good job of making sure they do the worst of everything the Oscars look at before nominating a film. Just for the record, I didn't feel like finishing this movie and I only did for the sake of this review to warn all those who dare to rent such a pathetic piece of work!",1072656000,7,5835,4.683953033268102

 Okay, I know EVERYONE is entitled to their own opinion, but I'm just curious if this person's head is screwed on correctly? I mean where do I start with this film?
  The acting is either wooden and stilted(even by usually good actors Thora Birch) or extremely over the top(Jeremy Irons, but really that's not necassarily bad), The dialogue is horrible, the storyline of two theifs trying to get rich is tired and boring, the cliches of the theifs and nobles and mages, man is it really boring and yeah, and the special effects are pretty much horrible as well, especially considering that they take up a lot of the film.
  The thing is, is that this film isn't even bad in a good way, its just plain bad. Normally I'm quite generous on stars, and actually I wanted to give 1, but felt bad, so there ya go 2.

1291033,1,B00003CXQM,"In December, 2000, two friends talked me into seeing what is probably one of the worst films that I have ever paid to watch in a theater: Courtney Solomon's abysmal directorial debut called ""Dungeons & Dragons"".  With absolutely no previous directorial or acting experience in film or television, Courtney Solomon was hired to spend a $35-million budget and direct a film written by two nearly equally inexperienced writers, Topper Lilien and Carroll Cartwright.  Topper Lilien and Carroll Cartwrights' only previous film writing experience was for the 2000 German production of ""Where the Money Is"".  (Topper Lilien also wrote for the canceled, 1998, single-season TV series ""Maximum Bob"".)  What was the management of the production company New Line Cinema thinking when they funded this trio to create a live-action film based upon the popular Dungeons & Dragons game created by E. Gary Gygax?  Afterall, this is the same production company that superbly brought J.R.R. Tolkien's classic trilogy ""The Lord of the Rings"" to life on the big screen.  Clearly, not much thought went into this box-office flop, but Courtney Solomon's ownership to the rights of the Dungeons & Dragons game was probably a pivotal factor.
The plot of ""Dungeons & Dragons"" can be summarized as follows: The Kingdom of Izmer is divided into the magic-wielding Mages and the poor commoners.  Empress Savina (Thora Birch) wants to change the status quo by extending equality to the poor, but the evil mage Profion (Jeremy Irons) wants to depose her.  After Profion takes a magic scepter that controls the golden dragons from Savina through political maneuvering, Savina must find the mythical Rod of Savrill, which controls the legendary red dragons.  Drafted into helping her are the apprentice mage Marina Pretensa (Zoe McLellan), the two thieves Ridley (Justin Whalin) and Snails (Marlon Wayans). a dwarf named Elwood (Lee Arenberg) and the elf Norda (Kristen Wilson).  Profion is assisted by the powerful soldier Damodar (Bruce Payne), who fights Savina's ragtag allies.
Sadly, mediocre computer-generated special effects could not transform this poorly scripted, dismally directed and inferiorly acted film into an entertaining and enjoyable experience.  Instead, I felt like I had lost two hours of my life for nothing.  Hence, the best rating that I can grant this film is 1 star.  My advice to anyone who hasn't yet seen the film is not to waste any time watching it, but if you are genuinely interested, rent a copy first before buying it.  Most of the actors who performed in ""Dungeons and Dragons"" have gone on to act in other films, but not surprisingly, neither Courtney Solomon nor the films two writers have done any work in film or television since.
If you want to see a better film featuring dragons, my suggestions include Matthew Robbins' 1981 film ""Dragonslayer"", Rob Cohen's 1996 film ""Dragonheart"" or even Rob Bowman's 2002 film ""Reign of Fire"".  (""Reign of Fire"" isn't as good as my first two suggestions, but is much better than ""Dungeons & Dragons"".)",1067472000,6,3050,5.133333333333334
1291034,2,B00003CXQM,"Good God as someone who used to play D&D I couldn't get over how archtypical the bad guy mage (Lawful Evil, probably around 18th-level) and his big brawny retainer (Neutral Evil, probably around 15-th level fighter or Anti-Paladin) were.
Although Jeremy Irons (Profion) is an excellent actor who I respect a lot, he did overplay his character in several scenes.  Damodar was just awful.  Blue lipstick???  Justin Whalen wasn't bad as Ridley, and Marlon Wayans was acceptable comic relief as Snails.  Thora Birch should be shot for her terrible performance.  My goodness was she TRYING to sound like a gradeschool Christmas pageant Mrs. Claus?  Whoever hired and paid her should never be in charge of casting another movie again.
The visuals were decent.  I thought the dragon at the beginning looked a tad fake, but the battles between the reds and golds at the end was fairly entertaining.  I liked the ominous sense of worry that came over me when Profion summoned the reds.  That part was very cool, and a definite highlight of the movie.
I wanted to see more creatures, too.  The Beholder was neat, and portrayed in a way I thought was accurate, as were the orcs in the bar scene.

1291036,3,B00003CXQM,"Although the title is Dungeons and Dragons, the movie retains very little of the game it has derived its name from.  Attempting to make an epic story through the inclusion of the powerful dragons, the plot quickly devolved into nonsense.  The hero of the story, played by Justin Whalen who should have stuck with the Superman television show, is gifted by the fey with a superior sword midway through the film, but continues to lose every sword fight he gets into.  His bumbling sidekick, played comedically by Marlon Wayans, is enjoyable but dies all too soon to suit mood of the movie.  Their pairing makes it difficult to imagine them as the heroes of a film trying to be epic in its storyline.  Aside from the over-the-top acting from Jeremy Irons and the little-used apprentice mage love-interest, none of the other characters makes an impact in the story.  The dwarven and elven companions to the group never even get one swing in during the entire movie, making their inclusion even more preposterous as they become more liability to their scenes than a benefit.
The best way to approach this film is to not expect too much, roll with the lack of reasonable plotline, and simply enjoy what it does deliver.  A somewhat humorous spoof of fantasy movies done poorly.",1051920000,,1271,4.776255707762557
1291116,1,B00003CXQM,"I have been playing, writing and running Dungeons & Dragons games for about 15 years now so I was pretty excited when I read that it was being adapted for the big screen.  I really hoped the film would bring some legitimacy to the hobby in the eyes of the general public.  But what Courtney Solomon has produced here is a festering heap of bad storylines and poor acting.
All you need to do is watch the extras on the DVD to see just how incompetent Mr Solomon is.  A hardcore gamer himself, Courtney explains his vision for the movie.  To produce a story that was appealing and satisfying for gamers and non-gamers alike.  Sure he might get an E for effort and passion but as the writer and director of this tripe Courtney Solomon has failed miserably.
Firstly lets look at the story.  Now fantasy stories are generally among some of the richest in fiction.  From the Lord of the Rings, to Anne McCaffrey's work to D&D spin offs like Dragon Lance and the Forgotten Realms, fantasy books are always full of rich settings and compelling characters. So why did a novice screenwriter like Solomon decide to try his hand at writing the screenplay?  Surely an adaptation of Weis & Hickman's Dragon Lance Chronicles, Douglas Niles Moonshae Trilogy or R.A. Salvatore's Icewind Dale Trilogy would have offered great settings and characters that are already established.  An adaptation of anyone of these series would also have guaranteed a flow on audience that were familiar with the novels but may have never actually played the Dungeons & Dragons game.
Recent successes like Blade, X-Men and Spiderman have shown that comics and fantasy stories can be turned into great movies with the right script and cast.  Failures like Gor, the Punisher and Captain America show just how bad these tales can be when you get the ingredients wrong.  Solomon's Dungeons and Dragons definitely falls into the later category.  The script only serves to alienate both the general public and the existing D&D fanbase by throwing is into a confusing setting full of shallow characters.
And the acting! Good God! The two stars with top billing, Thora Birch and Jeremy Irons, obviously don't want to be there.  Birch's performance is stunningly bland and average while Irons over acts and stinks it up at every available opportunity.  Justin Whalin is completely disposable, a store mannequin would have done a better job.  Marlon Wayans is ludicrous in his comedic side role as Snails.
Although some of the effects, like the dragon dogfight, are interesting they are not enough to save the movie.  Some of the effects like the Beholders are completely superfluous and do nothing to advance the story or characters.
Don't get me wrong I really tried to defend this movie to my friends before and after it's release, both as a half decent flick and then as a fun piece of B-Grade Schlock like Gor or Hawk: The Slayer.  But no this movie can not be redeemed, it is awful, it's awfulness is compounded by the fact that it could have been so much better and that fans like me deserved more.  Courtney Solomon should be imprisoned in a dungeon himself for daring to produce such garbage.",1051747200,2,3155,4.768382352941177
1291117,1,B00003CXQM,"This movie has no redeeming value at all. The acting was really terrible, especially coming from people who won oscars. The script doesn't make any sense. I also have never seen such terrible special effects! You get to see the fakest looking fantasy city ever. Do yourself a favor and watch the cinematics in the awesome PC game, Diablo 2. They totally kick this movie's arse and THAT is a fact.",1051228800,3,396,4.591549295774648
1291118,3,B00003CXQM,"I'll tell you why I like this movie...this is strictly fun popcorn fare and meant to evoke those late night Saturday sessions of failed seduction rolls and munching down cheesy puffs while alternately guffawing and sweating over the fate of an alter ego who exists only in the mind's eye and on a piece of paper much worn from erasing hit points and changing stats.
D&D the movie is just for fun.  Anybody looking for any deep meaning should look elsewhere.  Yes, it does owe a lot to Raiders Of The Lost Ark and Star Wars.  The main character of Ridley has about two dozen Harrison Ford moments throughout the film.  No its not completely a full immersion in fantasy, but then again neither were most of the D&D campaigns I played in.  Think of all the moments somebody would crack a joke or toss in a geeky line from a movie while you were playing this game - the filmmaker didn't try to create a fantasy world, he tried to portray the game as it was...a fun night of bickering and mishaps with the occassional monster and bit of melodrama thrown in.
There was no way this could please every fan, because each D&D fan had his own memories.  There were those who loved a lot of magic, and those who liked hack and slash, and those that were straight on roleplaying.  Maybe I only enjoyed this movie because the bumbling but ultimately heroic thief was always the kind of character I liked and played.  Anyways, don't try to see this as anything staggering or high-reaching as Excalibur or (sigh...) Lord Of The Rings, just enjoy it for what it is - there is a good deal to like...
The acting is way way over the top - but its fantastic in that regard.  The villains are of the mustache-twiddling egomaniacal comic book variety (particularly Jeremy Irons, who is so wild you can't even understand his evil wizard's ranting sometimes under the roaring of the dragons `Their blood will RAAAAIIINN from the SKIIIESSSS!' reminded me of  `We're gonna RAIIIN on you, Warriors!').  Demadar (sp?) speaks in an exaagerated cold rasp through the whole movie and goes around with a parasite in his head (and when Marlon Wayans mocks him late in the film its pretty funny)!  Marlon Wayans plays his typical scared brutha (a role he seems to have been born to play), and the guy who played Rosie The Eternal Flame in Freaked as the dwarf plays it to the hilt, gobbling turkey legs and in one hilarious scene (one of my favorites) stares at the camera and says `That's no way to do business. Mmmmm.'  And rolls his eyes.  Thora Birch is appealing as the mage if not particulalry memorable, and the elven chick is purdy, as she is meant to be.  These are archetypes from a game system, not really living characters with pasts of their own - they are the beautiful but aloof Elven Ranger, the crass and surly Dwarf Fighter, the likable but selfish Thief, etc...and no game of D&D is complete without them.
The production design ain't too bad - obviously it reflects the look of the new 3rd Edition rulebook, with elements that don't really belong in any time period.  But the golden coin-mail of the empress at the end makes her look stunning, and the other costumes (particularly in the Thieves' Guild scene) look cool as well.  Even the props are great - the Red Dragon Control Rod in particular, and did you notice that cool Michaelangelo-like mural of the mage using the Rod as he observes from a cloud?  I wonder where that painting is now...
The FX - not nearly as overblown as you might expect.  This director went to the Star Wars school sure, but it was the original trilogy, not the new garbage.  We don't linger or drool over CGI fluff for too long (like we do in some other recent fantasy movies I could mention).  We get nicely detailed establishing shots to give us a sense of place, and a big dragon battle at the end, which I think comes off rather well - the best since Dragonslayer - and not nearly as bad as Dragonheart.  Yeah, the Beholder is floating around in broad daylight - but so what?  Its a Beholder!  Highlights:  The Thieves' Guild Maze, The Dragon Fight at the end, Ridley and Snails breaking into the Mage Tower and getting caught.
The story - not nearly as terrible as some would have you believe.  Its linear, it makes sense most of the time, and its no frills. If there are flaws, they are the fault of market-minded producers who changed the director's original vision (as in most movies).  If you watch the extra material interview, you can tell his heart was in the right place when he did this.  As for the very ending, no it doesn't make a lot of sense - unless you consider this....D&D is a game.  This movie is based on a game.  Therefore it could be surmised that the characters are all people playing a game (that's why the three main characters are so young).  When the one character who died has his name disappear from his tombstone, and when we are told `Your friend waits for you' and they are all spirited away in a flutter of pixie dust, I like to think that its because the night is over.  The game is ended for now (its nearly dawn).  Yes, your friend is waiting for you.  He died early on in the night, so he made a food run and is now back with pizza and is waiting in the real world.  Thus `we'll stop here' and go eat and talk about the night's adventures and what's next, and probably a little of real life too.  If you look at it that way, this movie's not so bad.
My eleven year old son and I watch this movie and have a ball - even he knows when the actors are too much, and we laugh about it.  The dragon fight is awesome, the swordplay exciting, Marlon Wayans is funny, and the rest of the cast is passable and good looking.  A good family movie and a light bit of fun.",1051056000,5,5716,4.3931623931623935

Well, I almost walked out of this movie in the theater it was so bad.  It was almost like it was made by a bunch of concerned parents worrying about their teen playing the game, than actually KNOWING what D&D is all about!
This film is best forgotten!  Thank god for Lord of The Rings.",1050969600,,429,4.071428571428571

Anyway, I found the movie very exciting. The writing wasn't exactly Shakespeare and I was torn between thinking the acting was fantastic and the acting was the worst in the history of all time. None of that matters though cuz I really enjoyed this movie. The music definitely had my heart pumping, everyone on screen looked great and it all seemed such great fun.",1048636800,,620,4.495575221238938
1291121,1,B00003CXQM,"Dungeons & Dragons is such a poor film that it nearly set fantasy filmmaking back twenty years--thankfully, Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings saved the field.  As a long-time D&D gamer and fan of sci-fi and fantasy films alike, I went to this movie hoping for the best but expecting the worst.  Needless to say, my expectations were not disappointed even if my hopes were dashed.
First, there's the acting--or lack thereof.  It really says something about a film when Tom Baker of Dr. Who fame delivers the best performance on screen.  Jeremy Irons should have his Oscar revoked as his is by far the worst performance, with less-than-convincing sneers and bad guy leers.  Justin Whalin isn't terrible, but the Wayans kid--ick.  People in the theater literally CHEERED when he was seemingly rid of and booed at his eventual return.  Not a single character endeared himself or herself to the audience.
Then there are the props... for a Hollywood production, one would hope that magical staves, gems, etc. would look fairly realistic, but instead it's clear they are all made of plastic.
The film is not set in any recognizable D&D millieu despite the abundance of interesting settings.  Nor does the magic used conform in any way to the spells familiar to gamers; an apprentice mage casts some kind of dimension door spell left and right simply with her magic dust.  The dragons, presumably the focus of the film, actually appear only anticlimatically, and the ""dungeons"" explored by the main character could be solved by a three year old or even a mildly retarded dog.
The special effects are the lone grace of this film, as the dragons are done fairly well, and the magical spells aren't too poorly done, either.
The DVD version's special features, which include deleted scenes, are decent.  The alternate ending in particular is of interest; the director apparently thought it ""too depressing"" and mentions a third ending so terrible they even left it off the DVD, yet I think the alternate ending would have at least left audiences with something--if not the groan the theatrical version did, then at least a somewhat shallower scowl.
I've yelled at a few films in my day in the theater, but this is the first film that the entire audience joined me.  Please, do yourself a favor and check out all the other fantasy films available before viewing D&D.  Maybe some day a decent adpation of Dragonlance will be available, but until then, relegate this flick to your ""bad movie night"" pile.",1047427200,4,2490,4.846698113207547
1291122,5,B00003CXQM,"I did not go see this movie when it first came out in the theaters, because critics killed it.  But, I have learned that critics pretty much kill everything.  I am happy to say I have finally bought D&D and loved it.  Justin Whalin, who played Jimmy on Lois and Clark: The Superman Series was fantastic as Ridley in D&D. Justin plays a more realistic Hero, who matures and eventually faces his demons.  His ability to show life's pains and death with such a natural finese was refreshing.  I found myself joyous when he was happy, angry when he was bitter and thought of my friends when he interacted with Snails.  It was great to see a hero who showed so much emotion over his convictions and guilt over his friend's death.  Watch out Arnold, Mel, Sylvester and Bruce, HERE'S JUSTIN!  The customs and sets were awesome.  You actually get to see the beauty of Prague through the director's eyes.  Marlon Wayans' comedic antics were also refreshing.  I often find myself wondering if both Justin and Marlon have maintained a friendship very much like the ones they portray on screen.  Their chemisty sizzled.  Jeremy Irons was phenominal as the villian.  Sorry, Jeremy you just make a good villian.  Each time he has played a villian he brings the roles new dimensions.  Unlike other actors that are just plain old evil.  Keeping my fingers crossed for a sequel of which I will definitely be the first one on line to see it.",1046304000,5,1423,4.605577689243028

With this movie I think too much money was spent on developing the special effects and not enough time on the script writing.  This movie didn't seem to have much substance to it.

Nah, too easy.
I'll write my own cool story, complete with bumbling thieves and very eeevvill villians, toss in some staples of D&D like dwarves and elves, maybe a monster or two, some hackneyed plot about how a righteous princess wants equality among the classes of Izmer and, while I'm at it, destroy everything a D&D fan holds near and dear.
Why?  This movie, if done right, could have been BETTER than Lord of the Rings. But, for reasons unknown we are stuck with this for the big budget D&D Hollywood production.  The flaws with this movie are too numerous and painful to mention.  I'll just go over some of the main ones that show how the movie destroyed some basic tenets of D&D in one fell swoop.
-Dragons are mindless lizards?
-Gold Dragon gets killed by a collapsing gate?
-A Beholder is reduced to being some sort of snoozing security guard?
-Blue Lips?
-Magic library not protected, not even by magic?
-Snails dies, whats the matter, no clerics?
-Thieves scream when doing ""a job"" and also wear stolen merchandise on their head
-3 room ""maze"" has never been completed?
There are plenty more, and I am not even mentioning the acting and plot, which are equally horrid.  When watching this movie, I kept on wishing someone would cast an imprisonment spell on the entire party so I would no longer have to stare at them and wince at their antics, sadly, it never happened(man, even a maze spell would have sufficed!).",1041206400,6,1613,4.529209621993127

Just look back at all the incredible scenarios that the makers of D&D put out over the years. Utterly brilliant stuff. So why didn't they just adapt one or more of these scenarios? Why?

Sure it borrows a lot from 'Star Wars' and 'Raiders of the lost ark', but that doesn't really matter, because those movies borrowed a lot from old serials, errol flynn movies and the like.  If the performances had been better we could all sit back and have a fun ride. But for some reason Courtney Solomon has no comprehension of what a good perfomance looks or sounds like.
The DVD has some great extras.  The documentaries a commentary tracks all go along as though the film were good, which has sort of a bittersweet quality since we know it didn't turn out that way.  If you can find a used copy of the DVD for a low price you might want to buy it for this reason alone.
And, I must confess, this movie is sort of a guilty pleasure of mine.  It's bad, but it's probably the most enjoyable bad movie I've seen since 'Plan 9 From Outer Space'.

There isn't a single element of this movie that is in any way interesting, creative, or good.  Remember Indiana Jones, when he makes his way through dangerous mazes to get the item of the day?  That's here.  Remember the bar scene in Star Wars?  That's here.  Remember that story you wrote in the fourth grade that starred you and your friends fighting monsters on another planet?  That's probably better than this.  The hero, his token black guy sidekick, a random attractive female, a dwarf, and an elf go off in search of...well, that's never made quite clear.  That's ironic, considering the fact that bland exposition seems to be the writer's forte.  The plot (what little there is of it) involves dragons, a political power struggle, and a cute little empress who thinks that discrimination is a bummer.  The villain is evil because he shouts and bulges his eyes a lot and even does that annoying slow-clapping-thing.  He really has no motivation; all he has to do is push the empress off of one of the balconies of the CGI castle and claim the throne.  Instead he calls on dragons...or something...and sends a guy with blue lipstick after the hero and his gang.  The dialogue sounds like the writer took the scripts of several summer action movies, cut them up, and glued them back together, adding a bit of fantasy mumbo-jumbo and unpronouncable names here and there.  Classic lines such as ""I wouldn't do that if I were you,"" ""You shouldn't have done that,"" ""At last!,"" and, when the token black guy dies, ""Nooooo!,"" are lurking at every turn.  So is over-acting.  Even the extras act as if walking down the street is the most important event of their lives.

1291366,3,B00003CXQM,"DUNGEON AND DRAGONS isn't a very good movie. However, contrary to what the majority of other reviewers have written, it wasn't a completely terrible movie, either. The film had a built in fan base from all of us RPG's and former RPG's and the expectations were so high that it was a major letdown.

I won't try to explain the plot because it's so convoluted. Needless to say it involves some dungeons, lots of dragons, jewels, thieves, magic, swords, and colorful costumes. Also, the movie is heavily inspired by STAR WARS and INDIANA JONES.

There is a lot of over-the-top acting here and lots of cheesy dialogue. However, for a movie like D & D, this really shouldn't be a complaint, do you know how much cheesy dialogue and over-the-top actions come out of players mouths during a gaming session. Or have you actually listened to how much cheesy dialogue people speak in real life for that matter?

The character of Snails in the film is really annoying. However, he's also one of the more enjoyable characters just because he doesn't fit in with the norm of this world.
The dragon fight near the end of the film is great. It would have been nice to see it done bigger, but it's still a pretty cool fight.

The most confusing part of the movie is the end. I still haven't figured out what went on.

The basic storyline is this (sorry if it's hard to understand, but the runes that I'm translating from are a little hard to read): There's this evil guy named Profen (as in Ibuprofen) that exaggerates EVERY scene that he's in, flapping his hands around like some amateur actor. I'm not exaggerating. To show how evil he his, he sets loose this dragon. But the dragon, sensing how stupid this guy is, ignores his commands. Appalled by the dragon's disrespect, Profen kills the dragon in a scene that looks very reminiscent of the Rancor scene in Return of the Jedi.
 Back in the town, there are two guys, our two heroes. Well, actually, there's only one hero, the other is ""comic-relief"" ala Jar Jar Binks style. In short, the ""comic relief"" is VERY annoying.
 The two main characters decide to break into the magic guild's tower. Now that sounds like something Robert E. Howard's Conan would do, right? But our two main characters don't handle it as well as Conan would have. In fact, they end up meeting a feisty mage (magette, magess, whatever) that reminds one of Princess Leia. The main character acts like Luke in some parts of  the movie and cocky like Han Solo in others. He acts like Han Solo in this part, where they get confronted by a guy with a liking for blue lipstick and a claw that looks a lot like Predator's. Actually, Mr. Blue Lips was an ex-band member of KISS.
 They (the good guys) fight, they get away, they go to this village where there is this bar scene (Oh, that looks like that scene in Star Wars!) and they meet this weird guy with a purple head that looks kinda sorta like the Elephant Man.

Then they meet this elf that looks like Michael Jackson.

There's an Empire and a Senate.

A place where the Senate meets that looks like the setting for The Muppet Show.

The Phantom Menace introduced Princess Amidala. Well, this movie introduces her sister, Princess what's-her-face, and yes, her costume does change with every scene, and each time she changes her outfits get more and more ridiculous.

I was about to bet that Prince was going to have his own little role.

I was also about to bet that Mr. Blue Lips (who ALWAYS whispers) was going to say at some point, ""I see dead people.""

There are multiple scenes that reek of the Indiana Jones trilogy. Going through gauntlets, stepping on the right stones at the right time (Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade). Scampering over bare floor, trying to get an ancient relic, spiked ceilings coming down (Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom). And finally, to complete the trilogy, standing in front of a ruby, legs straddled-like, scratching the chin (Raiders of the Lost Ark). Yeah, I'd say that the makers of this movie raided a lot from other popular movies, as if they were thinking ""Hey, if we borrow all the cool parts from other cool movies, then our movie will be cool!""

Other Irks:

The funeral for Annoying as Jar Jar Binks-nuf said.

The ""grand finale"" is  a big flop.

And, finally, the fact that they force you to play this stupid puzzle game in the DVD edition, just so you can watch the deleted scenes.

Well, give or take a little black magic, that's what's in this movie . . . .

This movie is everything that a good fantasy movie like Lord of the Rings is not. Most of the special effects pretty much stunk. The 'artifact' looked like apiece of plastic on a stick. The deadly 'dungeon' (see the name) had a pit trap which dropped the hero right in on the treasure... Who in the world would do that? Monty Haul? The script was terrible and made very little sense, the acting was worse. Given that there were at least two good actors in this movie, the quality of acting was rather shockingly bad. In fact the only good thing I can think of about the movie is that it had Tom Baker (of Doctor Who fame) in a cameo. The plot was rather terrible. In fact the Heroes go to retrieve an artifact that could destroy the queen before the villans do. Upon reaching the resting place of the artifact, NO ONE ELSE COULD ENTER BUT THE HERO. Okay, call me crazy, but if nobody else can get in, JUST LEAVE THE DAMN THING INSIDE! Instead they get it, it gets stolen and we have to endure anther 45 minutes of pain and suffering because of this.

1291465,1,B00003CXQM,"Like many fans of the D&D game, I looked forward to the D&D movie with eager anticipation.  Would it be based on Forgotten Realms?  Dragonlance?  Spelljammer maybe?  But no, the movie was set in an original world, apparently unrelated to the published settings the gamers are most familar with.  ""That's not so bad"" I thought, ""A lot of original campaigns are very imaginative and compelling.""  Unfortunately, this movie was neither.
The low points of this movie have been repeated again and again by other reviewers, but I echo them as valid.  The characterization was abominable.  Birch's empress was screechy and pouty, hardly giving the impression of a strong ruler with revolutionary ideas.  Irons' villian was embarrassingly hammy.  The dwarf is so poorly characterized he doesn't even seem to have a name, he is simply known as ""the dwarf.""  The worst perfomance, however, was handed in by Wayans.  His cowardly, incompetent ""comic relef"" harkened back to the African-American stereotypes featured in movies from the 30's and 40's.  All he needed to say was ""yassa"" or ""feets don't fail me now."" to complete the picture.
The worst thing about this movie, however, was how the writers gave a token nod to the game without capturing any of its depth or details.  Fans of the game are supposed to recognize the beholder in one scene which is employed as a watchdog (and an incompetent one at that).  An audience member who would recognize a beholder, however, would also realize how ridiculous it is for one to occupy that role!  Likewise the dragons are basically an effect on the screen.  We are given no hint that dragons posses personalities, intelligence or any sense of granduer.  The movie basically treats them as flying war machines.
I could go on and on about the movies' difficiencies, including the sloppy editing and the plot which perfectly fails to draw the viewers in, but that would be belaboring the point.  Suffice it to say that this movie is best forgotten, except by those who are convinced that D&D is a tool of Satan.

It started out good:  Good guys doing the ultimate theft in the Magic School, being caught by the chick.  Then it went downhill from there.  If Jeremey Irons was the badguy, how come we didn't see very much of him?  What was the deal with the heroes sword?  And the ending was the worst of all.  The heroes main sidekick (I forget his name because this movie was soo aweful) did he die?  Was he resurected?  Or like Tupac, abducted?  You tell me, I never figured it out.
This movie had potential to be an excellent movie that could have outdone Lord of the Rings however like Star Wars, the director focused mainly on the special effects which was the only good thing about the movie.",1018483200,,810,4.311258278145695

You try and play for 2 hours and get the same kind of detail. Campains played with pen, paper and dice can last sometimes longer than if it were real time.
The characters were pretty well developed imho. Someone commented on the dwarf for instance, mentioning that he was white. What color did you exactly expect him to be? Green? Blue? Black? Have you ever played the game? He was a convincing dwarf.
To get more depth it would need to be made into a mini series or a series period.
There are certainly things I would have liked to see more of, but come on. They had 2 hours to tell a story.
I think if you are a dnd player and you are dissappointed it is because you are used to spending 4-6 hours in a sitting developing a story and characters. They had 2 at most.

I myself play D&D, and I got my hopes up at first about the movie.  Then I realized that it wasn't being made for ME.  Everyone likes something different about D&D and RPGs.  The director tried to include all the elements, but it's hard to do without having a long runtime.  They're making more D&D movies from what I've read so don't worry I'm sure something YOU like will be in one of them.

Some of the worst scenes take place in the Thieves' Guild where the Star Wars cantina scene and Raiders of the Lost Ark are blatantly ripped off.
The computer graphics, costuming, and set design are all very well done. Unfortunately the movie is lit like a cheap television show (the supposedly dingy Thieves' Guild has brighter lighting than some of the art studios I've seen).

1291470,1,B00003CXQM,"My only question is: with such a big budget, and such good actors, how could they go wrong?
The answer is simple: Its clear that the talent behind this movie spent more time on the CGI than on writing a decent script.
D&D is the story of two thieves who decide to take advantage of a magical disaster to break into a Mage Academy and burglarize the place. In doing so, they accidentally get embroiled in a plot to kill the empress's advisor and procure a mystical scepter which will allow the bad guys to maintain the status quo of peasant oppression.
What follows is a special-effects extravaganza, with about as much plot and character development as a Shatner movie.
Stereotypes abound as the Anglo main character and his ethnic sidekick battle evil in the form of (surprise) a group of evil mages composed of... Guess. More evil Anglo men. The troupe is completed with the edition of a red-bearded Scottish sounding dwarf (of course), and a waifish... Elven ranger.
The actors give half-hearted attempts to deliver their lines, but even THEY seem embarrassed to be there.
The only thing that worked for me in this movie was the great special effects and the beautiful dragon sequences. (What was with the villian with the blue lip-gloss???)

If you want cheesy fantasy action with no plot rent Kull or Beastmater or even Conan. D&D was just embarrassing.",1015632000,4,1358,4.754237288135593

(only if you've played D&D and are planning on getting wasted, of course.)
basically it comes down to the actors and their characters. the two main characters aren't really bad actors, and the leading lady is pretty cute. but then you've got a surly dwarf who never does anything, an elf who looks like hally berry strung out on crack (i'm guessing after she sighned on for the film and found out just what she had gotten herself into, they had to pry her bottle of wild turkey out of her hands every take.) a princess who is apperantly the skipper to queen amildala's barbie, and the roast of the toast, the bad guys. there are three of them, two main ones, and a side one, and i'm convinced they had a contest to see who could over act the most. a contest which acadamy award winner jeremy irons won hands down. the side villain was very entertaining. i don't know who played him but he looked like patrick stewart with scurvey. he was funny though. then you have damadar. imagine darth vader if he was trapped for several weeks in the rocky horror picture show. vader goes in, damadar comes out. and then there's irons. the archmage with turrets syndrome. you know, it's almost enough to make me want to watch it again, but i just don't think i can get that drunk...",1013472000,,1566,4.384879725085911

I even sorta dressed up when I went to see it the 1st (and last) time. This movie is a complete flop. The acting is poor and corny and the plot is lacking. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because of the special effects and scenery. No offence to the producers who obviously attempted to make a movie out of the great RPG classic, but I've played campaigns with a better plot. Lot of things in the movie aren't explained (i.e. the whole mission given to them when they were teleported in the map) and it was obviously made for a sequel, but I don't know how they are going to do that with the low box office sales of this one. Another downfall is that it has very little to do with the RPG, with the exceptions of the small camemo of a beholder, a hold-person spell(although it's done with a rope), and  the occasional joke or comment about the classes of characters from the RPG ( i.e. mage, theif, dwarf, elf, fighter, etc.).

They could of made it better if they improved on the acting and it could have been better if they lost the cheesiness of the movie and possibly loose the jokes/humor and instead made it serious.  On the other hand, the scenery was good but I thought they could've shown more of it.  Unlike many of the viewers I am not familiar with the Dungeons and Dragons game, but I did hear someone say that the way they potrayed it was all wrong and is really a serious game rather than the childish(?) humor of Snails ect. in the movie.  In fact I didn't even know their was going to be a sequel until the end.  I wonder how that will do?  Maybe they are working to improve it??

1291576,1,B00003CXQM,"After a dark and ominous opening narration, we see a great mage's chamber, almost completely taken up by the standard Giant Twirling Machine (a la ""Dark Crystal""). Cut to a wild-eyed Profion (Irons), who paces toward the camera and STARES. But wait! he's just staring at the machinery behind us. Lightning sparks, and the wheels spins faster: a wand is being charged. Profion extatically darts to the machine, plucks the scepter, and proclaims: ""Yes! At last!""
""Release him!"" Profion commands. A henchman gasps; he's never to be seen again. Henchmen spin flywheels. A grate is raised, revealing an irate dragon. The beast spits fire, causing henchmen to scatter. Cut to one tripping and falling. Cut to another catching fire. Profion points his wand and rasps: ""You are mine now! Come to me!"" His blue-lipped right-hand man looks on admiringly.  Then the spell is broken and the dragon gets mad. Profion crushes the beast with a portcullis and covers his face in frustration. There's always another day.
Thus begins a movie that does a disservice to the already-marred name of fantasy cinema, a genre with a ""Conan"" for every ""Willow."" ""Dungeons & Dragons"" is a relentlessly idiotic action-comedy that is best compared to Power Rangers: there's a lot of special effects and colorful scenery, but it's little more than computer-game grapics and some plastic armor on the orcs. To add insult, the movie has nothing to do with the game.
Alright, I take that back: there are a few things.  There's a tiny, meaningless cameo of a beholder; and a hold spell is mentioned (though it's performed with rope); even the kingdom of Izmer looks like something an amateur DM threw together.
But all the nostalgia in the world won't prepare you for the ""heroes"": a young queen (Birch) who ambles about spouting populist nonsense (""I do declare that you now all equal!""); a pair of young enterprising thieves, Ripley (Whalin) and Snails (Marlon Wayans), whose lingo and body language mark them as refugees from ""Scary Movie""; an oddly mangy and gangly dwarf, whose function is to a) run around waving an axe and b) to furrow his brows disapprovingly; Marina (McClellan), who knows about three spells and, I guess, is supposed to be the love interest for one of the thieves (not Wayans); and, lastly, Norda the elfin seeker, who appears to have been shoe-horned into the movie. This sorry bunch has to travel to a distant ruin to recover the Wand of Red Dragon Control for reasons unknown to the viewer (the charaters teleport INTO a scroll, and reappear with their mission explained to them).
Two questions inevitably arise: who lights the torches in the Antius Maze if no one's ever gotten through? and, more interestingly, how did Profion sneak that first dragon into the castle?
In addition, the movie is infinitely quotable: ""I've never seen a scroll so hard to decode! It's very ancient!"" (just like a sage to say that) ""You've gotta believe it, they're framing us."" (a bit too modern, no?) and, perhaps the best, ""Do not let them escape or you will suffer a fate far worse than that which has been inflicted upon me!"" (try yelling that in one breath!).
One scene is especially memorable: Ripley is surrounded by Damodar's troops, and decides to hold the scroll hostage by setting it on fire: ""Clear the way and I'll put it out."" The scroll catches fire - but doesn't burn.
Oh, alright, one last one: as Ripley and Co. leave the elfin lands, two masked natives speak in gibberish in the movie's one scene with subtitles. ""Does he know of his untapped potential?"" one blurbles. ""He soon will,"" replies another.",1011744000,18,3598,4.848780487804878

1291579,2,B00003CXQM,"Dungeon and Dragons. Well well well. The most popular role playing game so rich with material spawned this horrific chimera of a movie. Let's face it, Dungeon and Dragons was loosely based on Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. If they can made a decent movie out of Tolkien's trilogy, there is no reason why they could not have made a good Dungeon and Dragons movie. And this movie is far from good. Perhaps it will be one of those movies which is so bad that it became good and will achieve cult status.
Well, history will take care of THAT. But it cannot change the fact that for all the hoopla and publicity surronding this movie, it was all ado about nothing.
Let's say that when this movie ended, I was pratically running out of the theater covering my face, ashamed of being seen watching this wreck.
And how bad is this wreck? The moment the movie started and you heard a voice over telling you what the movie is going to be about, you know you are in trouble.
The first scene immediately set alarm bells in my head that this is going to be one stinker of a stinking cloud spell. When you see that the extras can't even turn a wheel convincingly....uh oh. Jeremy Iron's epileptic fits of overacting and Bruce Payne's blue lipstick doesn't exactly help things. Thora Birch who has proven herself a good actress all of a sudden seem to have forgotten how to act. Most of the cast were also saddled with really inane dialogues. The best example....the debate in front of the mage council between Irons and Birch.
The story itself need a lot to be desire. Considering the wealth of material and story plots already written in the various Dungeons and Dragons novel based on well established worlds like Faeraun and Greyhawk....all we got is Empress Savina attempting to grant equal status to non mage citizens??? Have Lolth the Spider Queen trying to take over the world and have the Empress sent a squadron of heros to oppose her....ANYTHING!
The only member of the cast who came off well was Zoe McClellan....but even she have more than her fair share of bad moments.
The special effects are adequate...but when it came to the monsters...such as the dragons and Profion's imp, as well as the beholders....I have seen computer games with more convincing details.
Considering it is a low budget movie to begin with, I may sound too harsh. But nothing excuse bad acting and bad story telling.
Ultimately, Dungeon and Dragons is really a movie that is marginally, if not superficially based on the game. We seen wizards, thieves, elves dwarves, fighters, rangers...but no clerics. So Snails died....big deal. In the game, a simple raise dead spell will bring you back in action. None here. Also, I don't get the sense that this IS a Dungeon and Dragons movie.
Perhaps it wasn't. Believe me, I have ran adventures more interesting than this.",1009584000,3,2835,4.660678642714571

But not worst than others of its kind like Krull, Hawk the Slayer, or even Princess' Bride. If you want to see good heroic-fantasy, you should rather see Excalibur, Conan the Barbarian, or even The 13th Warrior (one of my favorites). But there is something that many peoples seem to miss there: Dungeon & Dragons is before all a roleplaying game, and the film exactly show us a D&D roleplaying session. Nothing more, nothing less! From that point of view, I must say I really like the film. The evil guys (Profions and Damodar) are played exactly as most DMs portray them. And when I see Bruce Payne (Damodar) on the brink of laughter anytime he acts evil, I really enjoy the film. The heroes speak among themselves not like medieval characters, but like players arguing about dice rolls around the table. It's fun! Most events are stupid, but in fact they are like when we play the game. I mean: the low level thief who is the first in ten years to be able to retrieve the priceless gem from the maze. Really stupid, but exactly as in a traditional D&D scenario!! Or that underground complex decorated with skulls: silly, but so exactly like most D&D description of the ""evil dungeon"".
In fact, this film is for the true D&D players. Don't expect a true film, but don't say it's [not very good]. It's not [not very good]: it's a D&D session perfectly translated into film.

Jeremy Iron's character is rotten to the core, trying to force the Empress to reliquish her sceptor for the safety of the counsel--Well, it's evident what he wants from the beginning.
Actually I was disappointed with the person who played the Empress too. She only looked good in the costumes she wore that's it.  Her lines were pretty stiff also, obviously from not being allowed to leave the palace to see what really went on.
I am disappointed with this movie because some scenes dragged on too long, especially when the young people were bickering back and forth. They could have done more with plot development, though.

The story, about two theives sucked into journey to find a magical artifact that will help save a kingdom of rival mages from civil war, was not quite boring, but far from engrossing. It lightly touched on the ""mythology"" of the game from time to time, but never paid it the tribute that was due. The character development was mostly non-existent, so by the end I found myself not really caring what happened to any of them. And the casting... I'll take ""Movies that Marlon Wayans Should Not Be In"" for $400, Alex. Wayans doesn't ruin the movie himself, but just becomes part of a long list of negative qualities that make this film the abomination that it was.
The worst part of all is this: After being around for decades, D&D has a built-in audience. This is probably what New Line was counting on for profits. What they failed to realize is that the players take their game serioulsy, and unfortunately the makers of this movie didn't. The movie became more of a mockery of the game than anything else. Bad move, even if they were going for a more comical or playful angle. If New Line makes the same mistake with Lord Of The Rings, they will find themselves strongly hated after the holidays, and sadly bankrupt by mid 2002.
The only reason this gets two stars from me is becuase if you watch this movie with the attitude that it's ""just another cheesy adventure show,"" you may actually enjoy it. Grab a beer, and prepare to laugh at how horrible the movie is, MST3K style. However, if you are a follower of the game or the mythology of D&D, then this is a sad waste of time.

Trouble is too many folks expect too much and think that it should follow along with their specs, their ideas or even their charactors.

I know, I listen to people like the ones I'm referring to every weekend in my dinning room for hours on end for years.

Whoever allowed this film to use the term Dungeons&Dragons obviously had no idea how bad the movie was going to be. It really doesn't resemble anything to do with the popular RPG, except tarnish its name.
I actually thought the special effects were quite good. I don't know what other people were complaining about the dragons so much, they weren't that bad, it just seemed that way because they served no real purpose in the film. In fact, there were so many ""token"" fantasy elements in this it was laughable.
Ultimately the film was ruined by bad, bad writing and mediocre direction. Some of the scenes didn't even make sense, and there were gaps in the plot/story a mile wide.
What a shame and disappointment. When will people realise that a good fantasy story made into a good movie will actually be popular. A fantasy movie is no different from other genres, it needs good acting, a good story and believable characters. A pretty girl in a nice outfit does not a regal Empress make !
Please, someone out there do a decent fantasy movie. We have the technology for good special effects now. Let's hope Lord of the Rings lives up to high expectations (I have more faith in this because of the excellent cast and excellent director).

Howeverer, I always thought it would be cool to do a movie based on the game. When I heard this was finally going to happen, I figured the writers would draw on the rich background of one of the games worlds, such as Dragonlance, Forgotten Realms, or Greyhawk, one of the places that truly has the flavor of the game. Instead, we get some generic, unmemorable fantasy land populated by two dimensional characters spitting out bad dialogue in cheap costumes with second rate special effects. It's like somebody who had a bad idea of what the game is all about wrote this movie, and not a true enthusiast. Indeed, one must wonder if this movie had anything other than Dungeons & Dragons for a title if it would ever have made it to the screen. I can't say enough bad about this. I was truly disappointed, and almost fell asleep watching it. My 12 year old daughter enjoyed it, and maybe I would have to at that age. To me, watching this movie was like playing with a gaming group that I didn't like or that didn't have a real grasp of what the game was about. With so much wonderful material to draw on for such a film, I can't imagine what the director, producer and everybody else involved in the creative process was thinking. It's just one more thing to make all us hardcore gamers look like dorks.

I've been playing D&D since 1986, so I do understand and like the game...but this movie has precious little to do with the game at all.  The acting was terrible...Justin Whalin and Marlon Wayans should bury their careers after this.  Jeremy Irons was clearly in it for the money, and poor Thora Birch looked like a little girl playing dress-up in mommy's evening gowns.  The script was just plain stupid, not to mention disjointed and muddled.  The direction was amateurish at best.  The only good part of this eyesore was the special effects...and they weren't exceptional at all, just adequate.  When I saw it at the theater the audience clearly hated it.  People were walking out, laughing at the big dramatic parts and sitting silently through the ""comedy"" bits.  When Snails was killed people were cheering and applauding; I haven't seen a character that stupid and obnoxious outside of Jar Jar Binks (and Marlon Wayans should be ashamed of himself for taking such a demeaning role).  It's also sad that the game emphasizes teamwork, while the movie does not.  The so-called ""labyrinth"" is just a series of rooms opening on to one another.  The big dungeon at the end was a let down.  The fights are almost all human vs. human; some monsters from the game show up but they're mostly window dressing, on view for a few seconds at most.  (The one exception is the dragons, but even then they're wasted.)  If it had been less violent, it could have been a half decent children's movie...this flick has an overall juvenile feel to it, like a bad Saturday-morning TV show.

To be brutally honest, the Dungeons & Dragons movie let all RPGers down. We've been waiting for almost 30 years for the definitive D&D movie to come along and vindicate us in front of all those stupid jerks in high school who called us ""geeks"" for playing D&D. We wanted them all to see what we were so worked up about, and this movie just didn't do it.
It's still a fun movie, though, and the DVD has some GREAT features like the ""maze"" you have to navigate to make it to the Special Features Menu. The actors definitely gave it their best (it's too easy to overlook Marlon Wayans performance as pure throwaway slapstick), but they weren't quite up to the task. Except for Jeremy Irons, of course. That man took this as an opportunity to chew more scenery than the dragons! The film needed someone more experienced than Courtney Solomon to reign him in.  Nevertheless, the first-time director did a very whiz-bang job on his first gig.  Bravo!
I first saw the movie on opening day with 30 friends, fellow gamers, and spouses.  Our ""better halves"" were actually less disappointed than we were; they didn't have all their hopes and dreams hanging on it.
All in all, the D&D movie will forever be enshrined on many a Geek's shelf, right up there with ""Highlander,"" ""Blade Runner,"" and all the other movies that make us obsessive-compulsive fanboys.

First of all, the plot was shallow:  Characters are thrown together, they go on an adventure, they undergo various trials, you think they're doomed, but they wind up winning the day.  How many times have we seen that in a fantasy film?  Monsters which are intelligent in the game were treated like watchdogs (the beholders) or fighter planes (the dragons).  The ending was very strange.  And what was up with the spandex armor?

But I *enjoyed* the movie.  The raucous, drunken dwarven fighter was good comic relief (better than Snails, anyway); the special effects were impressive (especially in the dragon attack sequence); and the gauntlet that a character had to run to retrieve an item was actually rather impressive.

1291738,1,B00003CXQM,"This DVD has two things going for it. It has a huge dragon battle, I love dragons, at the end of the movie, and it has some really promising scenes it it. Unfortunatly, the SFX used for the dragons aren't up to par with fantasy movies like Dragonheart and all the good scenes were in the selection of stuff cut from the movie.
Things go downhill from here. This movie is bad. The director obviously spent every last dime he had to create the CGI for the dragons. Things like good actors and script writers were forgotten until the last moment. The script looks like it was put together by a monkey with a typewriter. To make it ""better"" scenes were ripped out of star wars and stuck in were appropriate. Did anyone notice that the elven villige scene looks exactly like the Ewok villige scene in Return of the Jedi?
The actors are mostly either, a)cardboard cut outs or b)overacting to the point of emberassment. Justin Whalin is the star of the show. All other characters are in the movie to either try to kill him, thus making them the bad guys, or to save him from the aformintioned bad guys till he has a chance to take them, the bad guys, out later. He is also the only actor allowed into any of the dungeons. This keeps all the other actors in there place, manly standing around doing nothing. If a DM ran this campaign, his players would walk out on him after about a half hour. You would never cater this much to a single player.
I almost cried when I saw the deleted scenes on the DVD. As I mentioned earlier, these are the best scenes on the DVD. I cannot help but wonder if these are the punchline in some cruel joke being played upon the fantasy and science fiction lovers of the world.
If you have to see this, take my advise, rent it, mute the volume, and watch the first and last ten to fifteen minutes of the movie.

I was not exactly captivated by the story or the acting - Jeremy Irons in particular was pretty awful, as was Richard O'Brien, and Wayans got on my nerves a little, but overall the film was OK (if you can ignore the number of times you find yourself comparing Ridley to a certain L. Skywalker...). The effects were quite solid, although the directorial touch of ""swooping"" into buildings and scenes did smack of amateurism - once or twice was OK, but it seemed like nearly every major scene change was accompanied by some whizzy shot of the outside of an impressive building. The most interesting part of the DVD was the extras. The deleted scenes show just how much of the film was cut, presumably for length - but in at least 3 cases, the scenes were vital! It was great to be able to find out just what did happen while a couple of characters were away (instead of them just not being around for a while, then reappearing and explaining what they had learned)... and the same applied to several other parts of the film, which felt rushed or confused when I watched them before getting around to the deleted bits.

Justin Whalin and Marlon Wayans displayed relatively good acting (at least they were cast in the right parts). The dragons were fun to watch. And the costumes were good. The downsides are that the plot was undeveloped. The characters could have been better. With the exception of a few parts, the dialogue was really bad, and as a budding writer myself, I know what I'm saying. And Thora Birch. She looks her part, but after I listen to her say her lines (or speeches), I begin to think that she must talk very quickly in real life and the director was trying to get her to slow down and inunciate. She was too obviously trying to speak clearer than normal, when in my mind an actor really should strive to at least sound like themself, unless they are faking an accent. Also, when she wasn't yelling at the pace of a snail, she was talking quietly but sounding like she was whining. I like her work in other films, but there are better suited actresses for her part. Two and a half stars for this film. Rent before buying. Might be a disappointment for die hard fantasy fans, but not for die hard dragon fans :) Oh one more thing: Maybe some others didn't feel the same, but I actually thought that this movie would be about the game, as in people playing the game.

It is not often that we can find a modern fantasy of this calibre.  It may seem to some people overacted or too high on graphics, but this is not so.  Jeremy Irons is perfect in his role as the evil mage, and he is complemented beautifully by Justin Whalin and Courtney Solomon.
This film manages to be hilariously funny, sad, romantic, exciting, and suspenseful nearly perpetually.  It delivers a constant stream of great watching, and, taking around nine years to make, it has had a great deal of hard work behind it.

It starts off with two petty thieves breaking into the Mage's guild, entrapping them in a gripping subplot with the Mages and the Empress struggling for control of the country, and trying to harness the power of red dragons.
Along their journey, they meet a host of wierd and wonderful people, including Richard O'Brian, reprising his role as master of the Crystal Maze.

As a seven year veteren of the real Dungeons & Dragons game I came into this movie with high expectations. Even if I didn't have high expectations this movie scored well below them. The direction was horribly done and, as a reslult, the actors all look lost without a map. Marlon Waynes gives the worst performance of them all and brough back horrible flashbacks to Jar-Jar Blinks. *shudder* Irons (an Academy Award winner) and Birch (who had an amazing performance in American Beauty) are wasted and Mclellan and Whalin both have potential but Walin had to be a cliche and Mclellan's needs some voice work (her screeching is second only to Waynes in annoyance). What truly drives this movie into the ground more than the horrible acting, mediocre special effects, and Waynes shrieking is its miserable script. It reminds of me of short stories I used to write back when I was 12 years old. Cliched lines litter this piece of trash like abandoned beer cans and used joints do at at a Dave Matthews concert. I would suggest watching this only if you are a fan of D&D and then only to show how NOT to run an adventure and to see how anything great can be butchered by nameless morons in hollywood.

1291960,3,B00003CXQM,This was actualy a good fantasy flick worth at least watching once.  However the bottom line of this one is you will either like it or hate it so rent it first...,995760000,3,162,4.0625
1291961,1,B00003CXQM,"I could've sworn I was watching an hour or so of out-takes or audition tapes. Well, if this is a movie, IT'S TERRIBLE! Do NOT soil your expensive Hi-Fi TV's with this big pile of Marlon Wayans infected ...! The acting is downright atrocious....even Jeremy Irons gets a sigh of disgust from me. The special effects were FAR from believable, equivalent to a cut out from a cereal box being slid across the screen! The plot was a bore, everything was predictable....with traces from everyother movie in the fantasy genre.......including cheesy ripoffs from Star Wars...don't believe me? Watch it, at your own risk! Personally, I'd rather watch Wing Commander (Yuck!) 6 times back to back than watch this pathetic attempt to profit from the big screen using a popular name.
Do what I did...endure to the end of the movie and start taking names of who's responsible for this waste of time.....action should be taken!",995673600,,911,4.883870967741935
1291962,1,B00003CXQM,"This movie did not live up to even my lowest expectations. The characters were lifeless, the plot lost my interest immediately, the computer graphics were so terrible and obviously fake that it ruined any scene where they were used, and the acting was HORRIBLE (Oh my God, I mean horrible doesn't even begin to describe it). Even Jeremy Irons overdid it with the soap opera drama that teetered on the comedic. The movie centerpiece ""rod"" looked like a toy picked up at at a local K-Mart complete with a flashing light (and probably even pulsating sound too). I am so mortified that I came so close to buying it without renting it first. The only redeeming qualities were the costumes, the score, and the reason behind why it was made.... to capture the fantastic worlds created by the game Dungeons and Dragons.",995587200,,811,4.71830985915493
1291963,5,B00003CXQM,"In all honesty I'm going a little high by giving it a 5 but I feel the need to make up for all the undeserved 1's it is receiving here. A truer rating for it would probably be about a 3.75, and a 4 for the DVD version when you include all the added goodies!
Dungeons & Dragons while not being Academy Award material, is quite well-done and very fun to watch. The acting by our lead Justin Whalin (probably best known for his role as Jimmy in the Superman TV show Lois & Clark) was captivating enough to have me completely empathetic with his character, our slightly reluctant hero, Ridley. The special effects were also well done. While I would have liked more exposition on the supporting characters and their motivations the movie pulled together fairly well by the end.
I grew up on books by Tolken, Terry Brooks and the like. I graduated to PC Role Playing Games such as Diablo and Diablo II, and although I've never played D&D I think that this movie stayed true to its fantasy roots.  If you're expecting absolute brilliance, innovation, and movie experience unlike any before you may be disappointed. If you are looking for an enjoyable escape from reality for a couple of hours, this is definitely your ticket!",995414400,6,1218,4.561643835616438
1291964,3,B00003CXQM,"Probably I am one of the very few people who went to see this rather disappointing film in Japan.  Its release date was same as that of much-talked ""Pearl Harbor,"" so why did I care to see it?  Because, one of the cast is Thora Birch, one of the best  young actersses up in America.  And the poster of the film in Japan displayed her name in VERY large letters alongside with  that of, of course, Jeremy Irons. Unfortunately, those two talented people are THE disappointment.  One is acting too much, the other too little (which is which, you already know).  Moreover, as is seen in films like ""Mortal Kombat "" or ""Street Fighters,"" another big problem is the lack of script, not the story.  Anyway, as this is based on roll playing game, the story must be about the fight between the good and the evil, but  the film does not have any other way of staging it than relying old tricks which we have seen in films like ""Indiana Jones"" (such as a cave full of deadly tricks) in  much better form.  However, having said these things,  as a fan of adventure films, I enjoyed watching it pretty much, thanks to  two surprisingly good leads (Justin Whalin and Marlon Wayans) and Zoe McLellan, whose fresh presence is suitable for  strong-willed heroine much needed in this kind of tale, (though she deserves much better script). Special effects are not particularly  special, but good enough to keep you awake, and  some gimmicks are based on good ideas (like a map that swallows you up)  After all, it is very easy to be cynical, especially when you remember the  lamentable results of the films based on any kind of games  (remember ""Super Mario Brothers"" ?) but you cannot always expect ""Matrix.""  Or can you?  Whether you want to see ""D & D,"" totally depends on that point.",995328000,3,1770,4.537974683544304
1291965,1,B00003CXQM,"And I thought Legend was a bad fantasy movie. I though things couldn't get worse then Kull the Conqueror. I was wrong. Well, maybe D&D isn't as bad as Legend. But what really makes it reek is the producer had the rights and was assumedly developing the story for TEN YEARS, and this spasm inducing excuse for a movie is the result. Let us note that I am not biased at all towards D&D; to the contrary, I rather enjoy role playing. But nothing could make me enjoy this. In one word, the single most painful experience in the entire movie is the script. It is bad. You could release it in Arabic and have Saddam Hussein begging for mercy in twenty minutes. Example: ""Boy I'd like to give those mages some payback!"" ""Do you REALLY think you can steal MY DESTINEY?!""  ""All people deserve to be free and equal."" THE WHOLE MOVIE IS LIKE THIS! Watching it with earplugs would probably make D&D about 50% more enjoyable. The story is your usual ho-hum about an evil mage (played, unbelievably, by Jeremy Irons) wanting to take over a kingdom by controlling a bunch of dragons. It's boring, and worse, a little incoherent. Special effects range from a blue-lipped warrior with snakes coming out of his ears to a guy getting sucked down into instant cake mix. Some fight scenes look alright, some look crappy, and some contain a woman wearing armor that only Madonna could be comfortable in. D&D is truly a horrible film, so bad it's even hard to laugh at its awfulness. I congratulate and salute you if you can sit though the entire thing with the volume up and earplugs out.",995241600,,1566,4.514084507042254

The armor and weapons looked like plastic throughout the entire thing! Sure, there were spectacular effects, but they were all but forgotten in the light of the acting and those heinous props! The maze-type scene kept my interest for about a minute, but it was just.. awful.

1292085,1,B00003CXQM,"I wouldn't have bothered to write this if not for the fact that the only other reviews seemed to be positive. I still can't believe what I see. Folks, this movie is bad. I mean, not just ""gee, that was sub-par"" bad, but the kind of bad where I actually found myself, days after watching it, letting my mind wander and consistently coming back to ""WOW, that was a really, really bad movie!""
 Ok. Now that I've begun to express my opinion, how 'bout some reasons:
 Effects: With the possible exception of some of the dragons, I've seen video game cutscenes with more realistic CG than that.
 Acting: Two words: Marlon Wayans. Well, actually, I'd leave it at that except for the performance of Jeremy Irons, who I am led to believe is a good actor. Not here. Don't believe me? Capitolize on one of the only reasons I can think of to actually rent this thing and watch his ""acting"" in the first scene. I was on the floor laughing.
 Story: The love story was the most standard, unimaginative, ""oh yeah, we should probrably have the protagonists fall in love"" subplot I have ever seen. Apparently some people were actually surprised when the poor, but fiesty boy and the snooty, aristocratic girl fell in love but I really can't fathom why. Was it because they hated each other for the first half-hour? Wow, didn't see that coming. As for the rest of the story,it looks like someone took 10 good movies and had them stapled them together by a blindfolded octopus. The quest, the initial defeat, the loss and gaining of friends, the ultimate victory. It's all there, but all done horribly. And then, to cap it off is a ""surprise"" ending that left everyone I watched it with immediately and unanimously saying ""...WHAT????"".
 On the positive side, there are two good things I can say about this movie:
 1. Tom Baker, of Dr. Who fame, is in it and, thankfully, gives one of the only good performances.
 2. It makes me look forward to renting Battlefield Earth so I can compare the worst Sci-Fi movie ever with the worst Fantasy movie ever.",994982400,9,2030,4.56043956043956
1292086,2,B00003CXQM,"I too am a avid fan of d&d, I just bought the new 3rd edition books.  This movie struck me as cheaply made and the acting was not good.

Compare this to Conan The Barbarian which was probably the best fantasy movie ever made even though it was in the '80s.",994723200,,370,4.111111111111111
1292087,2,B00003CXQM,"On the up side, the adventuring party (with the exception of Marlan Wayans) was well cast.  Unfortunately, there was little character development (the better portions of which can only be seen as deleted scenes on the DVD) and having Marlan Wayans scream like a girl every 5 seconds distracted from what little there was.  What's worse, Jeremy Irons, normally a great actor, came across as having a ""what am I doing in this stupid movie"" attitude.
Dungeons and Dragons fans will be disappointed as there are virtually no dungeons and far too many ""dragons.""  I use quotes because the ""dragons"" were small (in D&D scale), stupid, firebreathing lizards, nothing more.  We didn't hear a dragon so much as speak, let alone cast spells, when, if true to the genre, the dragons should have been far more powerful spellcasters than their human counterparts.
The DVD had failings as well.  The deleted scenes must be watched either with commentary drowning out the whole scene or without commentary altogether.  A prime example of a good deleted scenes section is ""Unbreakable"" where the director sets up the scene with his commentary then lets the viewer watch it as it was shot.  The effects were anything but special, as the deconstructing special effects section shows.  All they do here is show what we've all seen a hundred times over; wireframe to crude model to finished product computer generated creature (dragon) effects.  They don't go into the spell effects at all, though I doubt it would have been any more interesting.",994636800,,1526,4.952941176470588

They used fairly unknown actors and actresses, and to me that was a great idea. No type casting, or expected acting. I love Role Playing Games, and to see some of the identical usage of the game was great! The stunts were well done, and the special effects were pretty good. It, ofcourse, wasn't a perfect movie but compared to everything else I have seen in the last year it has been the best! It was a relief to finally see a movie I couldn't predict the ending of.

Now don't get me wrong, I am very open minded and I am not like a D&D version of a Trekker. I didn't look for nor care to see accuracies in the movie adaptation of the game. I just wanted to see a good fantasy adventure movie... The acting was bad, the directing was bad, the editing was bad, the story was illogical and generic, and EVEN the special effects were bad.

Instaed they used very little of those elements from D&D to create this movie.  The moive itself has some redeeming value by the fact that Doctor Who veteran Tom Baker makes a cameo as an ancient elf who heals the main hero. The DvD itself has delted secens which in my mind would have made the movie stronger if they had decided to keep those scens in.

If your looking to criticize a movie based off a game, go look at the other examples and then come back.  When I first saw it I thought the main character was too cocky, Captain of the guard was a lithium addict, the sidekick was cowardly and annoying, and the villian barely controllable.  After watching the second time, I realized it was it just good, no great, acting (though I still feel Bruce Payne's character spoke way too slow).  Courtney Solomon did a great job in bringing a realistic world with the classic conflict of the upper and lower class with the clash of a magical world..  There are many parts that leave you with some questions but those are answered (unfortunely) in the missing scenes.  Too bad many of them couldn't be in the intital release.

The acting. What acting? These were acting school dropouts. Make that actor wanna-bees that were expelled.  Plot? ""Who needs it"" - that's what the producers thought.  It was eye candy, and sour eye candy at that.

However, when I read that a movie was in the works, I shuddered...Hollywood will ruin it, I just know it! Today, I rented the film after work and suffered through. Why can't they get it into their heads that dazzling people with CGI effects does not carry the story. The writing, characters, direction and editing are what make a film for me. I'm sure they were pitching at kids, but the bulk of the people who have played D&D are adults. I was hoping for something which could at least marginally live up to this fine game. There were so many sterotypes in that film, I don't even know where to begin. Is there any originality in the collective minds of Hollywood anymore? If I wanted Xena, Warrior Princess, I would have turned to the Sci-Fi channel. The lead character can't break that Jimmy Olsen style, his partner is such a bad actor to begin with that he doesn't need to overdo the bumbling sidekick routine, the princess was too stiff, the bar was Star Wars pub revisited, and the exagerated cities, arms & armor, and costuming were outlandish. Keep it simple and create a story that will keep everyone's interest. One great aspect of the game is that nothing is as it seems 100% of the time. You need to have a little grey mixed into the black & white/good verses evil.

There was ONE spot that I found vaguely interesting, not for its acting, or the impact on the plot but because it reminded me of a Tarot card (the hanged man) and I thought that was kind of clever-- but because the hanged man means trial by ordeal that one comes through, the reference made me expect something deep & interesting later from this reference, which never happened.... Really, the only trial by ordeal was paying to see this movie, and I did not come through the trial improved.  I only stayed because I thought my friends were enjoying it (they weren't either).

1292292,1,B00003CXQM,"Just how sad can a movie based on a famous role playing game be? Sitting through this shameful excuse for an adventure/fantasy film was so sad, my eyes watered as if I was cutting onions for two hours straight. Dungeons & Dragons was such an embarrassment in so many different areas, I should have kept a tally on how many times my cheeks blushed bright red! The only enjoyment I endured while watching this eye sore came from my mouth as I endlessly commented put-down after put-down. Here's a short list of cons I thought might help your decision of whether to watch or buy (or neither)...please notice, not a single pro is too been seen:
1.) To Be Or Not To Be, It AIN'T: The acting in D&D is so horrible (which caused 75% of my blushing), it makes Xena, Hercules, and campy fantasy/adventure shows alike, look like Shakespeare classics. If you dare watch the film, take notice to endless mugshots and smirks while delivering the cheesiest and entirely unoriginal dialouge and one-liners. The body language they use while delivering such lines as, ""Pick on somebody your own size!"", urges you to yell at the screen, ""OH MY GOD THAT WAS LAME!"" with pride and not give a dang if you're once again yelling at the TV, like your grandmother, knowing the actors can't hear you.
2.) Can you believe Jeremy Irons actually has an Oscar?: What's this guy doing in this atrosity? Something I find quite humorous is the fact that Irons is taking this evil mage role to heart, speaking in an accurate accent and such, all the while the rest of the cast isn't at all playing off it. Their poor acting, without the slightest idea of what genre/style of film they are in, makes Irons look like a fool and comes off as over-acting.
3.) Wayans + girly screams + playing a kleptomaniac = What the heck? or possibly, ""Barf bag anyone?"": Another unwise casting decision at the least, which seems to be the film's weakest link. Marlon can be a funnyman...in comedy movies. D&D shouldn't need ""comic relief"", nor should it contain it. Plus the fact that theives are swift, intelligent, and commonly naive. Marlon has one right. But come on! He's clumbsy, sharp as a butterknife, and worst of all annoying in this role. Though the actual game's theives are most commonly elvenkind, that doesn't matter too much. What chaps my rear is the weapons at Marlon's disposal. A sword?! Give me a break. That clumbsy goof would cut his own head off...which doesn't sound too bad an idea.
4.) Plot? Really?! Where..?! Show me..!: I think that last sentence says it all. I got that notion in the first 10 minutes, and that's being generous considering 9 minutes was spent telling myself to not worry and that it could get better. That's the last time I listen to my Homer Simpson conscience.
5.) Special Defects: That's right. I swear they had something, then they lost it. Towards the end of the film Red Dragons are fighting the Gold Dragons up in the sky. The whole time I'm wondering why are they concentrating on the foreground where the actors are instead of the background where the main event is taking place..? Until...they show me why. A close up on the dragon's head lies the truth...which is: they surely didn't hire on the same dude who did the DRAGONHEART films. These dragons and special (ugh) effects are an additional 10% of forceful blushing. After seeing these ""special effects"" I'm sure you'll say the same thing I did...""I heard the movie only lasted in the theaters for about 4 weeks (give or take a week), which if you think about it, is 3 weeks more than what was spent on the ""special effects"".""
6.) The DVD will gross more than it did at the box office, but that isn't saying much: I'm sure the extras on the D&D DVD could sway somebody to buy it, plus hardcore D&D fans will probably faithfully stand by in it's defense no matter how bad they thought it truely was. I however, will deny/decline to anyone who asks me if I've seen it, want to see it, or want to watch it with them. Special Editions are becoming the ultimate excuse for many bad movies, which in fact is what NEW LINE does quite often. The special extras may be a treat, and yes, NEW LINE does make quite the DVD when it comes to ""special editions"", thus is where my 1 STAR rating comes into the picture. But after seeing this disaster, would you really want to watch the whole thing over just to hear a commentary? Then, since the DVD has two commentaries, would you really want to watch it again, just to hear the second commentary? If you did, I could guarantee this: Your eyes would burn, your ears would automatically go deaf 5 minutes into a commentary, your attention span would mimic that of an newborn kitten, and you will be staring at your own reflection in a puddle of your own (or someone else's, depending on how many people are watching with you) vomit that lays at your feet. Recommendation? Sure, I got one: Skip D&D and save yourself the cash it costs for eyedrops, hearing aids, uppers, and most importantly kaopektate. (NOTE: The remaining blushing (15%) was caused by waking up the day after viewing D&D, realizing it wasn't all just a horrendous nightmare.)",991612800,,5139,4.580890336590662
1292293,3,B00003CXQM,"What can I say? This movie was mediocre. But still worth watching. The problem is, it had the script had the potential to be one of the greatest fantasy movies ever made. But it was plagued by little things. For instance: The bad guy. Oh may gosh. From what I understand, he's usually a good actor. Well, he musta had an off day. Horrible job there.  Also, at the death of his friend, the main character screams and goes to his knees. In reality that would be an invitation for death, (and the act itsself was done badly at that.) The ending was, interesting, but could have been done better, and also, there are several scenes where changing just a single word, or no more than a few sentences would have made that particular scene much better. And after going through the deleted scenes a couple really should have been kept, they would have made the movie flow much easier.
  You see? little things. It was just the little things that ruined the movie. I'm not too familiar with the director's history, but I'd chalk the mediocraty of the movie to thier... poor handling... of the movie. I hope that if a sequel is made, they make sure that the little things are in order, if so, the sequel could easily redeem the first movie.
All-in-all, the movie is worth watching, if only once, and if only because it had so much potential.",991612800,,1331,4.469135802469136
1292294,1,B00003CXQM,"I hate to say that this movie was a major disappointment.  After all my years of growing up with Dungeons and Dragons and they throw this movie at me.  Were the movie done right it could have been very magical, but it was utterly horrible.  Lets examine some of the aspects that made this movie fail.
  Marlon Wayans as Snails was a very funny character that was just played all wrong within the movie.  The fact that they killed off his character to gain some emotion from the audience did not work, because it was not believable.  His battle scene with Damodar was horrible to look at and I actually laughed at the death scence.
  Justin Whalin as Ridley Freeborne was actually a good character to focus on the movie, but his part was written all wrong.  And the fact that he basically saves the entire movie is just not believable.  Were they trying to follow some aspects of D&D?  A Theif/Master Swordsman played by a human?  And then to wield a two-handed sword?  Not likely...maybe a Half-Elf..
  Zoe McLellan as Marina of Pretensa was frightfull to watch.  She was way to overly dramatic throughtout the movie especially at the scene were she yells at Ridley telling him that the empress wishes to make everyone equal.  Who is she trying to fool?  She is pretty, but no actress.  You best bet for future work is the become a maxim covergirl.
  Lee Arenberg as Elwood (Dwarf Warrior)......I am not even going to go there.  His part in the movie had no meaning and no purpose.
  Thora Birch as Empress Savina was a bold move to spark interest in the movie seeing as she was part of the excellent movie, American Beauty.  Thora's being in the movie did not even help the least bit.  And then there is the fact that she was barely written into the movie....
  Jeremy Irons as Profion was one of the worst parts to play.  He played his character as a mad, insane cry-baby that did not want to share its candy with the rest of the people.  Do he seriously think he could ever rebound from his role in Lolita?
  Bruce Payne as Damodar was the greatest and funniest part of the movie!  Talk about someone flunking evil character 101 class, he could not even get it right.  Be sure and give a good laugh at the scene where he tells one of this warriors not to mess up in capturing Ridley in a bar or they will suffer a fate worse than that was bestowed on him.
  I cannot believe they tried to milk the D&D genre with this movie.  I am glad it bombed because it was a movie that was rushed, and not worthy making.  If they make a sequel, it better be 100x better than this....that is all I have to say about it.",991526400,,2609,4.33402489626556
1292295,4,B00003CXQM,"I went and saw this movie in the theater a couple of days after it came out and I was a bit nervous, since it had gotten such awful reviews.  In fact, it ended up being a wonderful cinema experience.  I've played D&D since I was 15 (now I'm 22) and the film really captures the experience of playing the game.  There are so many in-jokes for gamers in this movie.  For instance, the characters wear black hooded cloaks in the middle of the marketplace to disguise themselves from Damodar and his thugs, something that looks ridiculous but never fails to work in a D&D game.  Also, I loved the part where Ridley and Snails laugh at Marina because she's a ""low-level mage"" and we all know that ""low-level mages are practically useless.""  Ordinary folks should like this movie too.  There is no moral relativism, so you can really root for the good guys and pick out the bad guys immediately.  It's a fun popcorn flick and it doesn't pretend to be anything else.  Some people are saying that the acting is bad.  I would say that I was only disappointed by Thora Birch's acting, because she is very, very wooden, as if she doesn't know what she's doing in the movie.  Jeremy Irons has a blast and hams it up, but then again, what would you expect to find from a megalomanical evil wizard?  Marlon Wayans as Snails was a fun character and very heroic (as can be seen in his scenes with Damodar), definitely not a ""Steppen Fetchit-like"" character as some critics suggested (people are too sensitive.)  I would have to say, however, that the script could have used a little more work.  The characters of Norda the elf and Elwood the dwarf don't seem to have any purpose, even though the actors do the best they can with the roles.  Also, there could have been more summary in the beginning of the film to help the uninitiated learn what are elves, dwarfs, mages, etc.  Those changes are the only reason I did not give this film 5 stars.",991526400,2,1929,4.452991452991453

Without a doubt this was one of the worst movies ever made (you can add Krull and Hercules to the list too).  The acting (if you can call it that) was horrible and overplayed like I've never seen. The two main bad guys (Profion and blue lips) were way over dramatic with every sentence. It was horrible to watch and hear. The two main heroes (thief 1 and thief sidekick) were no better. Why did they have to act so silly the entire time, giggling and screaming like two little girls everytime they encountered problems. I was actually relieved when the sidekick thief got killed. The story made little sense and left many questions unanswered. Why did blue lips have blue lips? Why did blue lips take the mage-girl back to some castle somewhere instead of to Profion? If the princess was not going to surrender her scepter, then why did they need the 'rod of seville' or whatever it was called? And what was that crap at the end? Where did they go? Why?

1292297,4,B00003CXQM,"Before watching the deleted scenes, I would have given this movie a 3 star rating at best.  Many of the scenes that were cut were removed to reduce the running time or because there was insufficient time/funding to complete it.  Unfortunately, these are the scenes that link the major events together.  From a directorial view, the viewer can make assumptions that link these scenes together.  However, when you are playing D&D, assumptions don't work; you can't say ""I leave the sewer,"" especially after guards have just been assigned to watch the sewer exits--you actually have to find your way out and elude the guards.  This is one such scene that was deleted.  Many of the other deleted scenes provide useless information, but valuable character interactions.  Had these scenes been included in the film, the thin plot could be overlooked a little becauase the caracters would have been more richly portrayed.
This is not a great action movie, and it is not a great D&D adventure.  It treads on middle ground, and does a fair job of it.  Having watched the deleted scenes, I do not feel that my money was wasted, but I do wish that the deleted scenes had been included (even the 5-6 minute scene that was cut from the beginning would have been welcome).",991440000,,1258,4.76036866359447
1292298,3,B00003CXQM,"First of all, let me say, that contrary to popular opinion this is not a bad movie.  This is an average movie with the budget constraints that the director had to work with.  The studios estimated that in order to do movie the way the director would have liked, it would cost 125 millon dollars.  If you watched the DVD commentary at all, you know that they were short of funds.  Several of the scenes that they wanted to shoot they couldn't.  As far as cheesy special effects, I admit that the foam rubber beholders were bad, but the director admits that also.
I won't go into the plot, you have probably heard about or read the bad reviews by now anyway.  All I can say is that I didn't think the movie was bad.  I just thought it was average based on the budget constraints, and the time frame that they had to work with.  Bottom-line if you watch the DVD at all, this will be explained.  If you like D&D or fantasy gaming at all, I think that you'll have a good chance of liking this movie.  Whether or not, the planned sequels come out.  This movie was designed as the start of a trilogy.",991440000,,1093,4.231884057971015
1292299,1,B00003CXQM,"I have to admit that my motivation for renting this movie was partially due to my old days playing the game, and partially to avoid a fight if I watched a ""good"" movie by myself. I knew going in that this would not be a stellar movie, but I at least hoped it would be good enough to captivate me for awhile.
To be fair, I figured I would divide it out into sections.
Good: 1. Some of the special effects
Bad: 1. Acting, especially the wooden Jeremy Irons and Thora Birch. Her acting makes the acting in Phantom Menace Academy Award caliber.
2. Some of the special effects. The dragons belong in Shrek instead of a live action movie.
3. Marlon Wayans. Other than a weak attempt at being comic relief, which fails miserably, this person has no role in this movie other than an attempt to make sure people from a variety of backgrounds and races see this trash. Having been a D&D player, I have never seen a thief dressed up like a ghetto rat in this supposed medieval society. Yuck!
4. The plot. An interesting premise gone to hell. So many of the plot elements are horribly contrived and way too convenient to catch my attention.
I did not mention the fact that this movie does not follow the D&D world at all, and adopts a politically correct stance, as I do not feel you should rate a movie on how true it stays to its subject. Movies are supposed to be entertaining and should be rated on entertainment value.

I don't care about special effects or rule violations, I don't mind if the evil guy is pathetic (incredible, how you can make of a good actor a pathetic character), but, for the sake of god, the very basics of ANY Dungeons & Dragons story is TEAM WORK!!!. And here you have a group of people that just follow Ridley (the hero) and don't do NOTHING. I mean NOTHING!!! The principal idea of the movie was not bad, but the sequence doesn't have any sense... The Izmar Queen is a bad copy of the Neverending History movie, Profion laght like a maniac ALL THE MOVIE... And, the final sword battle between Damodar and Ridley is so false... and is a copy of Starwars. I think that must exist more or less 25.356 D&D DM worlwide with a better story to tell.

1292361,2,B00003CXQM,"The movie was absolute garbage - THAT is a fact.  The much-maligned Marlon Wayans was certainly not the worst actor in the film -- that honor is shared by Justin Whalin, Jeremy Irons and Thora Birch, the latter two looking very much like they stepped on to the wrong set one day and got stuck playing in this turkey. The effects are intrusive and cheap-looking. The makeup (especially the blue lipstick on the menacing henchman and the orange beard on the ""Drawf"") is horrible. And the story is, at best, boring.  What is good about it?  Not much.  Zoe McLellan does a fair job as Marina and Tom Baker is fine as the Elven Elder.
The DVD is an excellent product.  The supplemental materials are fantastic and there is a pretty good selection of deleted scenes that make you think the director wasn't so incompetent after all for cutting them.  The biggest burr in the saddle is the two audio commentaries.  The first with the director, Courtney Solomon and lead actor Justin Whalin is horrible.  All they do is giggle like loons who seem to be getting a joke that no one else does. The second with the cinematographer instead of the lead actor isn't much better and tends to be a little dry. All in all the movie is a painful dud -- from a Movie fan and D&D player.
Instead of making this boring tale as a Dungeons & Dragons film, they should have tapped into the many worlds TSR already has. Dragonlance or Forgotten Realms offer many opportunities for an excellent story.

My Opinion:  I was disappointed by D&D. I had even heard the bad reviews before seeing it, so I was prepared. When are they going to learn that special effects do not make up for a good story, characters, and plot. I am a huge fantasy and science fiction fan. I wanted so badly for this to be good, but the story just wasn't there.  The plot was convoluted and hazy and the characters undeveloped. The humor was misused and poorly timed. The Saturday morning cartoon by the same name was far superior because it had good stories and characters (If you haven't seen any episodes of this one, watch for it. It's on from time to time). Basically the movie is just really disappointing to a fan. By using the name Dungeons and Dragons, they got our hopes up. What they delivered was eye candy.

Now, I realize that there's a lot of gamers out there that take their games very seriously, but in the games I've been in, there was a very lighthearted feel most of the time, with a lot of jokes, and laughing at/with each other, and just general enjoyment.  This movie actually reminds me of the way our games were.  Not on a story level exactly, but if you pull yourself back to the player level, rather than the character level, and watch it again, you might see the same thing.  Imagine each of the characters in the movie as a player, doing and saying what a player might do and say, and it turns out to be much better.  Yeah, a lot of the dialog is corny, but I've definitely heard worse sitting at the table with my dice and books.  Some of the effects weren't the greatest, you say?

Granted, the FX are really good, and watching that many dragons flying around is a wonder, but those are far and few between to compensate for the rest of the movie.  My sister watched this when it first came out, and she's not a fan of fantasy at all, but she thought it was ""okay"".

With that aside, this movie is just plain awful.  In fact, I feel really upset that my brother bought this for me considering the profits go to the producers who allowed this script to even get approved.
You can read other reviews if you really want to know what the plot was.  All you really need to know is that the plot is terrible, the acting is terrible, and the ending is terrible.  To me, the plot was almost the same as Star Wars: Phantom Menace; the queen was almost the same character as that of Amidala, Marlan Wayans makes Jar Jar Binks tolerable, Jeremy Iron's ""Sith Lord"" is wearing Blue lipstick instead of red and black paint, and there is even a corny bar scene (a la Star Wars) that is just a waste of CGI money.
DVD extras include deleted scenes (which should have been joined by the rest of the movie), trailers, a commentary which I am not up to listening to, and a documentary on ""gaming"" which really gives gamers an even worse reputation.
In all, I know I am rambling, but after just watching this stinkbomb, I am confused, insulted, and upset all at the same time.

For a movie that isn't billed as a comedy, well the director really missed the boat.  We start off with a couple of thieves (normal D&D stuff), but for supposed thieves these two make more noise than any group of 2 year olds I can think of.  Next we add in a mage who doesn't really do magic and seems to spend most of her time getting rescued by the smarter of the two thieves.  Next of course comes the dwarf, who really doesn't seem very dwarven at all and spends most of his time picking things out of his beard.  Finally, to complete our little party, we add an elven tracker whose character seems taken directly from Star Trek's Mr Spock.
To this inept group, add in very stilted dialogue, poor special effects, a run of the mill plot and finally and ending that makes no sense.

1292468,5,B00003CXQM,"I'm not saying that the movie did not have its flaws, for example (Jeremy Irons in what seems to be ""scar"" in person), and the empress did not act to good either. But the movie is what is suposed to be... FUN!!!!!!. I have never played the game before, maybe thats why I liked it so much, because if you see a movie based on a game of some sort thinking that it will be as great as the game your wrong, odds are that ""Tomb Raider"" or ""Final Fantasy"" won't be as good as the games,they will be fun acction movies that just happen to be based on a game. You have to go see this movie as what it is... a MOVIE.
 The special efects were really good (I would've liked the dragons to be more like ""Dragonheart""). the acting was good. Before ""The Mummy"" nobody thought that Brendan Fraser would be a believable acction hero, now some people say he is the ""new action hero"", why not Whalin he did a great job. The rest of the supporting cast was good especially Wayans as the sidekick and the mage girl(really cute).Come to think of it Irons did an ok job, he is playing an insane man so he did ok.
 The music score is one of my favorite next to ""Jurassic park"" score. So all in all see this movie because it is a good example of what a GOOD fanatsy/comedy/action/adventure should be. And to those who take movies a little TOO seriously I say this: ""Don't take movies too seriously they don't have the meaning of life or something they are just for entertainment"".",990576000,3,1456,4.233812949640288

1292617,3,B00003CXQM,"I didn't go see ""Dungeons & Dragons"" in the theaters because of the slew of bad reviews it received, but as a fan of this genre I definitely had to at least catch it on video.  After viewing it a couple of times I can't understand why this film seems to be so universally hated.  Yes, the acting is hammy, the directing is shoddy and the script has some pretty lame dialogue in it.  However, I found the special effects, production design and music all to be top notch, especially for a film with a relatively small budget.  The story was interesting enough, too, though definitely nothing special.  True that special effects, production design and music alone don't make a good movie, but for a film of this genre to work, it's important to create a fully fleshed-out fantasy world, and I feel that ""Dungeons & Dragons"" definitely accomplishes that.  I admired all of the work put into creating the kingdom of Izmer, where the story is set.  Too often in fantasy and sci-fi films, details that are not relevant to the plot are simply ignored, but we must remember that part of the reason that ""Star Wars"" is so successful is because Lucas endeavored to create a fully thought-out universe that we could immerse ourselves in.
Izmer is such a wonderfully crafted world that I would much rather see this film again, with its bad acting and bad plot, than waste my time with garbage of no redeeming value whatsoever like ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" or ""Armageddon"".  At least with ""Dungeons & Dragons"" I can admire the scenery.
In short, ""Dungeons & Dragons"" is not a great film, but if you are a fan of the fantasy genre, you should definitely check it out.  Keep your expectations low, like I did, and you may be pleasantly surprised.  It's a pretty fun adventure romp marred mainly by bad acting (Jeremy Irons, Thora Birch and Marlon Wayans are particuarly awful and ironically the only ""name"" actors in the film).  If you can overlook that, you'll have a good time.  And if they ever decide to make a sequel (unlikely, judging from its terrible box-office performance) set in the same world, but come up with a better script and cast, it could have the potential of being a classic in the genre.",990576000,,2189,4.584615384615384

1292619,1,B00003CXQM,"This movie is competing with Battlefield Earth for being the worst movie ever made. First of all, did the concept designers ever even play D&D, or had they only heard about it? I personally found this to be more the plot you'd expect in a cheap fantasy novel than a well laid out D&D game.
Aside from the general plot, I swear the dialog was written by a 2 year old. Rather than spend a few $ on a decent screenwriter they chose to have an annoyingly large number of badly-animated fly arounds of the stupid castle. This movie makes for some great MST3K roleplaying on your part, however.
Finally, the acting. I recall Jeremy Irons no actually being that bad of an actor. After a long painful experience of watching this I finally concluded that the director, Courtney Solomon, is probably just clueless or had a BAD BAD 6 months. Either way, this movie was an experiment in the heat capacity of american dollars, and should probably be avoided, and rented for MST3K purposes.",990403200,,976,4.582857142857143

Unless of course, you can seperate the movie from the game.
If you can, you will probably enjoy this movie.  Go into it thinking the title is ""Good and Evil"" or basically anything else and you have a chance of enjoying it.  Does the movie borrow from others?  Of course - what movie doesn't anymore?  Are the effects a bit dated?  Maybe.  Could the acting have been better?  Shame on you Jeremy Irons.
Why did it get 4 stars from me?  Because few people even TRY fantasy anymore.  Those that do, butcher it in far worse ways than this one does. In the ""Scream"" and ""You've Got Mail"" world that is today's cinema, its refreshing to see someone at least TRY.  Fantasy without magic is drama - remember that when Lord of the Rings comes out later this year.

I had hoped there would be something good about this new one but I'm prepared to believe it is the worst yet.  The acting was completely juvinile (""THE SKIES WILL RAIN WITH BLOOD HAHAHA!!"").  The script was like something that had been written in the span of two days (""You're a low level mage..."").  And the whole concept was as frail as a skyscraper built with matchsticks.

1292624,1,B00003CXQM,"I don't even have that much personal experience with pen-and-paper Dungeons-and-Dragons roleplaying; I had a crummy gamemaster and after a while it just sorta lost my interest.  But I went to the theater with the hopes that this would be a pretty cool movie.  The previews all looked pretty good, after all, with lots of dragons flying through the sky and flythroughs of dungeons.  I figured that even if it was a bad movie, it would be a bad movie in a good way, sorta like Mummy Returns managed to be.
Well, not only was this movie bad, it was BAAAD.  The special effects were not very good, at best; yeah, they might have seemed pretty sweet, but if they were good, you wouldn't have said ""Ooh, look at the cool computer-generated dragons!"", you would have said ""Holy.... Shoot, those dragons are cool... those ARE CGI, right?""  But putting aside the five-year-old computer animation, there was so much else that went wrong with that movie.  The acting, for instance.  It was... really laughable.  I mean, the main characters were good for a few laughs in the beginning, as they tried to play some humor off each other... but as the film prograssed and the shallowness of the storyline became appearant, it just became annoying and worse.
As for the storyline, I wasn't expecting high literature when I walked into the theater.  I would have settled for something fairly straightforward, in fact, as long as the special effects had been kickass (they weren't) and the acting had been passable (it wasn't).  And that ending...!  I don't want to give it away, of course. the film would have been almost saved if the ending hadn't been so... bad.
I mean, there's really no other way to cut it.  This film was bad.  It's certainly not worth the price of the DVD, though as it hasn't been released quite yet, I can't comment on the DVD itself.  This might be worth the price of a rental, if you really, REALLY, want to see the film.  There are other fantasy films out there, though, that would probably offer a lot better entertainment value.  Hopefully, and I'm sure I'm not the only one thinking this, the Lord of the Rings movie will be a far better faithful adaptation of a fantasy tradition than this was.",989366400,12,2208,4.623076923076923

Don't get me wrong - there were many things about this movie that I liked.  The battle scenes were fantastic, and the special effects were outstanding.  However, there were some things that just did not sit very well with me.  For example:  What self-respecting wood elf would use a crossbow?  Why was the elven ranger wearing plate mail?  And what was the deal with the magic dust - don't the people who made this movie know about spell components?  And why did the beholders just sit around and sleep?  There are so many things that could have been done differently to make this movie better, and the producers and directors ignored them.  If there is a sequel to this movie, I hope it isn't as disappointing as this one.  I expected so much more, and the movie didn't deliver.  It was still a good movie, and I plan on watching it over and over.  (Remember - Star Wars is a ""B"" movie, and it pales in comparison to its sequels).

Unfortunately I got this. I have been a fan of the game many years and have held it as the authority on fantasy so I expected that a D&D movie would hold the same standard. As soon as I saw the preview I knew it would not prove true. I expected the movie to be darker,drearier, and with more hardcore battle scenes, more like Braveheart. While the production was that of a Xena episode, the movie does have good qualities, hence the three stars. It does have great fantasy elements and some role playing elements. Unlike most people, I thought that Wayons and Whalin were great together and did have a companion like chemsitry. Irons on the other hand, who is the more known actor, was horrible. I have never seen somebody overact so bad. I cringed at his delivery. This movie is simple fun that I would recommend to fans of the fantasy genre, due to the lack of fantasy movies, but not to anyone else. In the World of Dungeons and Dragons there are many good worlds and products. Unfortunatly this movie will label all D&D products and stigmatize any efforts to make another. There is no end to how many D&D movies that could be made. I will buy this movie despite it's shortcomings.

I grew up on the 80's fantasy movies, and let me tell you, with the rare exceptions of ""The NeverEnding Story"" and ""Willow"", all of those movies were pretty cheesy themselves. For example, I don't watch ""Krull"" because of the special effects, or for the brilliant storyline and acting (sarcasm),  I watch it because its a fantasy movie, pure and simple.

1292714,4,B00003CXQM,"When I went to see this movie in the theaters (and I did), it hadn't been too long since I'd gone through the tragedy now known as Episode 1: The Phantom Menace.
Needless to say, I'd become accustomed to setting the bar quite low for established licenses and being a fan of both movies and role playing games for decades+ years had given me a pretty comprehensive range of the best and worst of both.
So, all that said, what was my initial reaction to Dungeons & Dragons the Movie? Pretty good, actually.
While I would have liked just as much to have seen a re-imagining of the '80s cartoon show or an interpretation of one of the established campaign settings from TSR's (now WotC/Hasbro) catalog of games, I was willing to give the generic party of fantasy tropes a chance because I had seen it so many times on screen or on the table top and knew that good stories can also rise from humble (if uninspired) origins.

What we got was kind of a mixed bag. The look of the film with settings, costumes, effects etc. was pretty decent in execution and presentation. The actors were in no way terrible with a few memorable performances (particularly Bruce Payne's blue lipped lackey character and the maniacal Jeremy Irons) even if the protagonists weren't that compelling (except for Lee Arenberg aka the Dwarf).

The story was the sort of/kind of epic tale you might expect from your DM at the beginning of a new campaign or module, but didn't exactly come together in a way that felt like it paid off in the end.

Over all, the story just feels like a squandered opportunity considering the enormous amount of source material and story telling capability that came with this license.

After I bought the DVD and got to watch a lot of the behind the scenes extras and unfinished scenes, I think I had a better idea of what Mr. Solomon was going for with his story and regret that the additional scenes hadn't been able to be integrated into the film.

To that point, I should probably give the overall score on this movie closer to 3 stars, but with the DVD extras that helped to fill in some of the gaps and gave me a better appreciation over all I'm setting it at a ...

Soft 4, definitely worth checking out if you're a fan of the swords and sorcery flicks or rpgs, but check your expectations at the door.",988934400,,2309,4.459715639810427

Dung it is! This film is absolutely terrible.
But sometimes, that's ok.
Bad movie = Funny Movie.
My pals and I were rolling on the floor when we saw this film. I have never had a better time at a movie, except maybe when I saw Star Wars the first time. However, this was much, much more fun.

1292720,4,B00003CXQM,"Dungeons and Dragons is a fast-paced, exhilarating, and often innovative fantasy film that certainly exceeded my expectations, even if it does contain some unfortunate, but not critical, flaws in its storyline. While this review is detailed, it does not contain spoilers.
With regard to innovation, it is certainly refreshing to see a fantasy film that is not cloaked in a science fiction disguise, dares to contain no obvious element of direct appeal to children, and has no visual depictions at all of the modern era. Even better, it takes fantasy to its extremes as, unlike most standard D&D adventures, there is no reluctance to depict: thieves as heroes, insanely tall buildings (mainly towers - as one might expect of a city dominated by mages), heavy and frequent use of both standard D&D and new magic by experienced aristocratic wizards, very dramatic use of extremely powerful magical items and monsters, and an epic plot of empire-shattering proportions. It is regrettable to think that this last point needed some improvement - but more on that matter later. Personally, I love escapism, and this film is one of the best ways to achieve that state of mind as I have ever seen in visual form.
To complement all these extremes of fantasy, larger-than-life characters are presented as both antagonists and protagonists. Jeremy Irons, in one of his most controversial roles, expertly plays the main villain Profion, the Empire's most powerful politician and wizard. It is his self-appointed driven, megalomaniacal destiny to overthrow the current government and rule as some sort of dictator. In both his private and public scheming, he sometimes shouts, rants, and raves...but this is credible when one considers that this is exactly how certain famous dictators have behaved in the real world. Later, when Profion is on the verge of possibly obtaining his goal, he releases all his henceforth barely suppressed emotional fury so that the often unexplored territory of ultra-selfish, highly destructive naked lust for power is plain to see in all its triumphal ugliness. Profion's henchman, the cold, brutal, and sadistic fighter Damodar embodies a common truth to so many tyrants in that they get others to do their truly dirty day-to-day work so they can retain at least some veneer of respectability.
On the side of good, a few figures deserve special mention. The main hero, Ridley, an extremely capable commoner with plenty of untapped potential, displays considerable complexity in his motivations throughout the film and even has a dark side that surfaces periodically. Ridleys' best friend, Snails, eventually shows that a less than heroic life can be redeemed. Their new adventuring companion Marina, slowly, but ably, bridges the gap between the mages and commoners on a micro-scale. Empress Savina shows considerable passion and authority in both her brave words and actions, capably defying the accusations laid against her and behaving like a truly good, but firm ruler. Lastly, Elwood the Dwarf embodies the often amusing stereotype of his race while still providing valuable assistance where it is needed. To be sure, these characters and others are acted with passion and liveliness which might be too much for some viewers, but considering what is at stake in this fantasy world and how the movie does not take itself too seriously and tries and succeeds to be exciting and fun, this fact is perfectly understandable.
All these characters, settings, and events are supported by a superb musical score...one of my all-time favourites. The rousing score perfectly enhances the emotions of every single scene and is well worth a listen to on audio cd apart from the movie. Composer Justin Caine Burnett is to be highly commended for his fantastic effort!
Regrettably though, the storyline, as full of potential and frequently innovative and thrilling as it is, could have used some additional work. My main problem is the morality of using the evil red-dragon controlling Rod of Savrille. I personally find it hard to accept that a good ruler would ever use such a device, especially if she already has a similar device that controls good dragons. It's best for the viewer to assume that the Empress wants the Rod solely to keep it in her safe custody where she would never use it, but rather keep it from Profion's covetous clutches. This way, good and evil are much better defined and some storyline ambiguities cleared up. Furthermore, it would have been appropriate to make the film at least half an hour longer as most people don't have the time or motivation to read the movie's supporting literature to get a firm grasp on the backstory and some of the more complex details concerning the development of the characters and the political situation. I don't have any real problem with the film's various cliched scenes, as there are sufficient innovative scenes to balance them out and all cliches are presented in an exciting manner, backed with appropriate music and interesting characters. D&D purists should realise that this movie does take some liberties with the game's rules, but these concerns can be explained away owing to the usual practice of having at least some new rules/spells/etc. for different D&D worlds, plus the usual constraints placed on movie makers by the nature of the film medium.
I recommend this film to all teenagers and adults who desire escapism and/or a convincing, thrilling fantasy based action/adventure. Personally, I cannot wait for the sequel (which is set up in this film). Dungeons and Dragons is an impressive, even if flawed, effort from a first-time director who should improve as he continues in his profession after this promising start.

1292721,2,B00003CXQM,"""Dungeons and Dragons"" was Overdone in Every Possible Way, Except in Excitement and Entertainment. Sets were Far Too Busy; Effects were Far Too Computerised, (I don't think there was a single shot in the film that didn't have something computerised in it) and the Acting...My God, the Acting. I'll need a whole Paragraph to express my feelings about the Acting.
Firstly, ""Dungeons and Dragons"" doesn't feature Actors; It features ""Over Actors"". Everyone, Absolutely Everyone in the film Overacts. From the Leads to the Extras, from the Shakespearian Trained Actors (Jeremy Irons, Bruce Payne), to the Square Jawed Heroes (Justin Whalin, Thora Birch), to the So Called Comic Relief (Marlon Wayans). They all Chew the Scenery.
The Special Effects simply look Fake, there is no easier way to put it. If we, the audience, are expected to Care about the characters, and what is going on, we have to believe (at least a little) that what is happening.. IS Happening. The Effects are a Constant reminder that we live in the age of Computer Graphics. Instead of thinking ""Dragons are Attacking that Man"", I was thinking ""That Man is Standing in front of a Blue Screen on a Sound Stage"". The Effects may look Cool here and there, but they never once look Real. If this same Special Effects company made ""Jurassic Park"", it would have Flopped Big Time.
The film Blatantly Steals some scenes, or elements from the Infinitely Superior ""Star Wars"" and ""Indiana Jones"" films (any Star Wars or Indy fan should Easily be able to pick out at least 5 such instances) in a pathetic attempt to leach off their Popularity.. It doesn't work, not by a Long Shot. I suppose you can't blame them for trying, but we can blame them for going ahead with the film without tweaking it's many flaws.
Whoever gave this film the Green light, without Insisting on a few Dozen script rewrites, deserves to have this film on their Resumes. It will teach them to put a little more Effort in next time.

1292802,2,B00003CXQM,"Gimme a break. Rolling up characters for an actual D&D game would be a better use of time. The acting deserves an award, the kind given to the most promising high-school thespian in a small town. Lines are repeated and expressions are worn, but it's not enough.
Fortunately, this is an action flick. Acting is secondary. There are enough melee scenes for any pubescent lad to get his testosterone blazing. Plenty of choreographed fight scenes & clever effects. Stop action animation is better than we saw in 50's B movies. But, an important point was overlooked--everything in the movie is new. Clothes are clean, just off the costumers' sewing machines.
Let's not forget the villain, Profien. Not at all convincing, more of a geek. Banal, not convincingly evil. This, then, is perhaps the most real part of the movie. True evil rarely wears horns & carries a pitchfork. On the other hand, if you see a bald guy with blue lips & an attitude ... Run!
I wouldn't let a child less than 8 or 9 watch this movie, and nobody that young without an adult in the room. There are some intense scenes which a younger child could find disturbing. Unfortunately, most people old enough not to be disturbed will be old enough to be bored.
Pretty much a two star movie all around. Personally, I wonder if somebody didn't use their DM notes as the basis for this script.

1292803,3,B00003CXQM,Being another Huge fan of AD&D for 15+ yrs I just had to go see it. I even conned the wife and kids to go along since this was supposedly the movie of my lifetime...WRONG. I liked this movie just because of the D&D name..truthfully no other reason. This movie was made for children. If you like Xena on TV then youll love this. The fighting scenes are rediculous..not a scratch was ever shown or maybe it was hard to see through the dirt they threw on the actors. Adding a Wayons for comedy relief was another horrible idea that still baffles me. This was supposed to be D&D not Saturday night live. To make a long story short my kids liked it so don't buy the DVD just get your kids to watch it on Saturday morning!,985910400,,716,4.195652173913044

If you are looking forward to seeing beholders..errr..don't...there seen for 10 seconds and they do nothing, apart from float. The final Dragon battle scenes suffers from, what I call, Phantom Menace'itus. This is to say all you want to see at this point is lots of dragons fighting. But what you get is a poorly directed scene that chops and changes without you ever really being able to get fully immersed in the action. The middle part of the film is shallow and the full potential of a fantasy setting is never realised.
As a kids entertainment film it is fine. As a Dungeons and Dragons movie hire it out on video on rainy night when there is nothing else to do. Sorry but its true.",985046400,3,778,4.402777777777778

1292806,2,B00003CXQM,"Courtney Solomon, who is apparently an avid D&D player himself, makes an awful directorial debut.  Personally I cannot even  comprehend how a true fan could make such a hash of a promising film idea.  With book after book of excellent resource material to borrow from Solomon has instead written a story which has absolutely zero originality, creativity or appeal quite frankly.  To summarise, good guys must recover an *artifact* so the bad guys can't use it to take over the world with their nasty scheme.  If the plot is to be beaten for sheer tripeness it's only by the dialogue.  This movie really does contain some of the worst dialogue I have ever heard in a movie.  It's not even cliched, it's just bad.  For example when the evil Damodar catches goofy thief Marlon Wayans in the act of stealing a precious map he says ""Just like a thief ...always taking things that don't belong to you.""  Well DUH!!!!!
The cast itself isn't that bad.  We all know that Jeremy Irons is a highly capable and talented actor, though he has nothing to work with here.  Justin Whalin makes an able rogue and I believe he has the qualities to play a good lead role in a credible movie.  Marlon Wayans serves to lighten the film and succeeds for the most part although this does create a slight problem.  The film seems confused as to whether it wants to be a lighthearted adventure or serious fantasy film.  For this reason the audience reaction is often not what it is supposed to be.  One minute they expect us to laugh at the rather immature slapstick comedy and the next they want us to feel sad because a main character is killed.  Just doesn't work.  The serious moments in the film just provoked a laughing reaction from the theatre audience when I saw it.
I have read many other reviews for the film and am totally bemused by the few people who have applauded the special effect.  Especially when you consider that this movie has been made 4 years after Starship Troopers and even 2 years on from Phantom Menace yet the effects take a huge leap backwards.  Obviously the budget was limited because the CGI is comparable to that in movies made for television rather than the big screen.
I am trying not to be TOO negative because I myself am a D&D fan and the movie was not a complete waste.  If you are not a D&D player and watch expecting nothing you may enjoy this film, however I truly believe anyone who does have involvement with the hobby will be horribly horribly disappointed.
Oh and if you see it check out the very strange ending.  What an odd way to end a film.  It's the final proof that the director just doesn't have a clue.",982540800,2,2632,4.485294117647059
1292807,1,B00003CXQM,"I too am a D&D player and have been for over 20 years now. I am also a movie lover - and for you naysayers - not just of the sci fi/fantasy/action brand.  I remember when Gary Gygax (the founder of D&D back in the 70's) was planning to finance a film in the 80's. I have been waiting in anticipation since then. Imagine my excitement when I found out that one was actually being made.
Imagine my disappointment when I saw the film. I tried to like it. I wanted to like it, but I didn't. The only reason why I didn't hate it is because I am a fan of Dungeons and Dragons. Had I not been a fan, I am sure I would have shot this down in flames and then kicked the flaming mess when it landed.
For those of you that have read some of the other reviews (which I agree with in the main), I might mention that Courtney Solomon (Director) optioned the rights for this film back in the early 90's. He was in his early 20's then. He is 28 now I believe. He is an avid D&D player and had been pursuing the rights for a while before he was given the go ahead. He wanted to make a D&D film that players would be proud of. I guess he wanted to do it right to show up all those poorly made fantasy films of years past.
There are a few valuable lessons here: 1. Being a fan does not necessarily make you a great writer(oh yes, I'm afraid he is responsible for that as well) 2. The press releases for this film indicated that Courtney had ""never been to film school"". Even if he had, he probably couldn't have saved this one, but it could have been a whole lot better too. 3. A great cast means nothing.
I don't believe that this film was directly pitched at the 8-12 year market. Wizards of the Coast (current owners of D&D) are marketing their products at the older age group (an attempt was made to lure a younger audience to D&D in the early 90's and it was unsuccessful).
What I cannot believe is that after all this time of having a story developed and raising funds etc he still managed to stuff it up.
A sequel you say? Never. Most movies don't break even at the box office, let alone make money. This one won't which pretty much guarantees that the D&D movie franchise will end here. That's what hurts most about this film - the D&D game is the most successful of its type world wide with dozens of spin off industries (novels, games etc) but they will probably never get the chance make another D&D film and do it right.",980899200,6,2413,4.112288135593221
1292808,1,B00003CXQM,"If you like fantasy books and such stuff, If you are interested in FRP or if you like good visual effects; then do NOT WATCH this film. It is obvious that the effects have been cut to make the film cheaper. You can see at most 3 or 4 spells casted. And the effects are very typical. The dragons are just fire ball throwing big birds. And the wizards (even eith higher levels than 7) can only cast fire ball like catapults. The story is weakly represented and the scenes are very inrelevant to each other, just like the movie Charlie's Angels. The jokes and conversations are very very typical and you know what they will say before you hear it. In conclusion, even I (I am a real fantasy fan) got bored watching this film.

1292809,3,B00003CXQM,"Quite frankly, I went into the theatre not really expecting much. I just wanted to pass an afternoon and spend an otherwise dull winter day without having to think too hard. Basically, that is what I got.  It is certainly not a great dramatic award winner. From a special effects point of view, I thought it was well done. The script was a bit cheesy, but it was fairly well-acted and worth the matinee price I paid to see it.  Was it a masterpiece? No, of course not, and anyone looking for one will probably be very disappointed.  But it also was not as terrible as some critics would have you believe. It was harmless fun and nothing more.",980380800,,642,4.378151260504202

7917945,3,B00003CXQM,"RELEASED IN 2000 and directed by Courtney Solomon, ""Dungeons & Dragons"" chronicles events in the kingdom of Izmer where the idealistic Empress (Thora Birch) advocates equality between the mages and commoners while the power-mad Profion (Jeremy Irons) plots to overthrow the Empress with the help of his formidable henchman Damodar (Bruce Payne). A ragtag team is assembled to save Izmer by apprehending the Eye of the Dragon: Two thieves (Justin Whalin and Marlon Wayans), a beautiful mage apprentice (Zoe McLellan), a dwarf (Lee Arenberg) and an elf girl (Kristen Wilson).

The first shot with Irons hamming it up as the diabolical Profion made me bust out laughing. In other words, the movie telegraphs from the get-go that its not to be taken seriously. If you can roll with the campiness, this is an amusing throwaway fantasy flick. Imagine the gaudiness of Star Wars (1977) if the story were transplanted to a Medieval-like kingdom where dragons & magic are reality and youd have a good idea of what Dungeons & Dragons has to offer.

This was a theatrical release that cost a whopping $45 million, but totally bombed at the box office. The 2005 sequel Wrath of the Dragon God (with only Bruce Payne returning as Damodar) cost just $15 million and is slightly better because the creators took the material seriously, but its decidedly TV fantasy fare.

The film scores pretty well on the female front with the winsome McLellan and cutie Birch. Whalin and Wayans are entertaining as the two main protagonists, if you can get past their goofiness. People love to hate Snails (Wayans), but I found him to be a likable, amusing character.

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 47 minutes and was shot in the Czech Republic (Kutn Hora and Prague). WRITERS: Topper Lilien and Carroll Cartwright.
