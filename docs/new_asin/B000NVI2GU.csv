2783607,5,B000NVI2GU,"Deadwood is simply one of the best TV shows ever. Savage, bloody and profane-Deadwood also pulsates with a deeply moral core. This 3rd series has a few flat spots and superflous characters, but it's arguably the most tense and exciting of the three. And there's more of the wonderful black humour to go with typically jarring and brutal passages of violence. The acting, casting and production are magnificent-and of course there's the peerless dialogue that makes for transcedent televison.

Plot follows the tyrannical and murderous George Hurst's quest to own Mrs Ellsworth's rich gold claim. Anybody whose seen Series 2 will remember Hurst's creepily homicidal Lt. Mr Wolcott, well Hurst himself makes him look like a cream puff. Gerald McRaney essays Hurst with such a vicious amorality that we are in no doubt the entire town is in dire peril.

Leading the stand for Deadwood is, of course, Al Swearengen (Brilliantly played by Ian McShane as per usual) and the ever volatile Seth Bullock (Timothy Olyphant). It's these two and the rest of the exceptional cast  that make Deadwood must see viewing. It's a tribute to how good this is that most fans will gagging for the promised TV movies that will bring this superb series to a close.",1181174400,12,1241,4.92822966507177
2783608,5,B000NVI2GU,"The abrupt, ignominious, disasterously deflated ending of this scabrously funny, gut-clenchingly taut series was one of the greatest letdowns in TV history.  Other than those last two episodes and the facile resolution to the threat presented by Mr. Hearst, though, this was an awesome season of hard-hitting adult storytelling bliss.  Incredible acting, suspenseful stories, lots of creative language.

It's a pity that David Milch and HBO couldn't work their differences out -- the world is a much poorer place without Al Swearengen in it.",1180742400,8,541,5.416666666666667

2783610,5,B000NVI2GU,"The wait is almost over and I will soon be able to watch Al rip people a new one every single day... My girlfriend is going to go nuts when I get my very own copy of Deadwood Season 3...

WHY MUST IT END!? Damn you HBO for not renewing the actor's contracts!",1178841600,4,258,3.8679245283018866
2783611,5,B000NVI2GU,"The third, and possibly final, season of HBO's critically acclaimed Deadwood had it's share of slow moving moments to be sure, but the series as a whole lived up to the excellent precedent set by the previous two seasons of the show.  As the third season opens, sheriff Seth Bullock (Timothy Olyphant) makes a run for re-election, which gets side tracked by forging an uneasy alliance with Al Swearengen (Ian McShane) against the vendictive George Hearst (Gerald McRaney) who comes to the camp with some deadly plans for everyone involved.  The lives of newly weds Alma Garret (Molly Parker) and Whitney Ellsworth (Jim Beaver), as well as Sol (John Hawkes) and Trixie (Paula Malcomson) are in jeopardy as Hearst prepares to wreak bloody havoc, which is mainly what this season of the series is focused on.  Also during this season, we witness the recovery of Cy (Powers Boothe), as well as bonding between Calamity Jane (Robin Weigert) and Joanie (Kim Dickens), and the debilitating health of Doc Cochran (Brad Dourif).  If you've been a fan of the show for some time, you know what to expect with Deadwood in terms of it's vulgarity and violence, so if you're new to the show, you won't really be won over by anything here.  That being said, the third season of Deadwood is some truly great TV regardless, and the ensemble cast as usual is superb; with Olyphant, McShane, and McRaney being the best of the bunch.  As the previous reviewer stated, if this is indeed the final season of the show with no other kind of resolution, there isn't any real cliffhanger that leaves the viewer cursing at the screen (a la Carnivale).  That being said, hopefully this isn't the last hurrah for Deadwood, and there will be another chapter before these characters ride off into the sunset.",1174780800,76,1777,4.787581699346405
2783612,5,B000NVI2GU,"""Deadwood"" either is your cup of tea or isn't, and if it isn't, then you probably have no business even considering prchasing these DVDs; the third season in't gonna change your mind.  If it IS your cup of tea, and you're just wondering whether or not the third season meets the high marks set by the first two seasons, allow me to answer: it does.  In some cases, it even surpasses them.

The third season finds the camp in a general tizzy about the upcoming elections for mayor and sheriff, and Al Swearengen in a bit more specific tizzy about the impact the arrival of George Hearst has had on his life and livelihood.  In a sense, the entire season is about the power play between these two titans, with Cy Tolliver trying to edge himself into the mix somewhere and Seth Bullock trying to figure out what his place is in the whole mess.

Amongst the other plot threads explored in this season: Jane's growing friendship with the increasingly troubled Joanie Stubbs; Alma's opening a Deadwood bank; the feud between Steve and Hostetler; the oddly touching relationship between Trixie and Sol; Elsworth's marriage to Alma, which may not prove to be the bed of roses he had hoped for; the appearance in town of the Earp brothers, and of a troupe of actors; and, of course, Seth Bullock's ever-present willingness to be grumpy with the wrong person, Farnum's weasly nature, and Merrick's desire to write about it all.

The plots don't matter much, though.  The dialogue and the acting are what make this show great.  ""Deadwood,"" in its three seasons, had so many iconic moments that it makes most other shows look like film-school projects in comparison.

In addition to the regular cast standouts -- Timothy Olyphant, Ian McShane, W. Earl Brown, William Sanderson, Brad Dourif, Molly Parker, Powers Boothe, Robin Weigert, and so on, ALL of whom do Emmy-caliber work -- I think special mention needs to go to Gerald McRaney, who turned up right at the end of season two but becomes an integral character in the third.  His portrayal of Hearst is just awesome.  Not that he's better than anyone else on the show; he just immediately fits in with the tone of the show, so much so that it really feels as if his character had been there all along, lurking in the shadows somewhere.

Much has been written about the fact that HBO decided to cancel the series, and pretty unexpectedly; but don't fret too much about the show ending on a cliffhanger.  Not all plot points are resolved, but there is at least a sort of closure; it's like the first two seasons, where it feels as if a chapter has ended, but the novel will continue.  Well, it looks like the novel WON'T be continuing -- HBO has claimed that there will be two two-hour movies to wrap things up, but no filming dates seem to have been set, and it's been months since anyone had anything to say about that project -- but if the series has to end with the close of the third season, I won't feel as if I was cheated too terribly badly.  I'd prefer it had run for ten or twelve years, but hey, we're lucky the doggone thing ever even got made.",1174780800,155,3097,4.5350089766606825

2783614,3,B000NVI2GU,"I really liked the plot and character development. Finally . . . a series that relied on storytelling rather than green screen or discombobulated action. However, I did NOT like that every sentence (about 98%) had the F-word; it was very annoying and detracted from the dialogue. The other 2% had something crass in its place. All of this was unnecessary and hence my reason for 3 instead of more stars. It was disappointing not to see how the story ended. Hopefully, there will be a movie to wrap everything up without doing a disservice to the clever storytelling.",1518652800,,566,4.7272727272727275

2783631,5,B000NVI2GU,"As a history buff with a fascination for pioneer stories, this hits every mark with me.  I love being transformed into this (real) 1870s mining town, the characters are deep and likable.  From the down trodden prostitute Trixie who kills and then rises up,  to stubborn, righteous Bullock who tries not be himself but can't help it.  Swearengen is my all time favorite, as a cantankerous leader, and villainous thug, yet a visionary and willing savior.  They all have interesting flaws and aspects that are relate-able.  I enjoy the level of detail, the scenes, especially the background (sets) which really set the tone and bring you there.  Some plots follow actual events (Wild Bill Hickok's murder) and characters which make it that much more compelling.  Not to mention, the writing is hysterical (truly brilliant).  Yes lots of ""f"" this and ""c"" that - but I accepted that was the lingo.  This show is truly one of a kind, and I am bummed to only have 3 seasons.",1510444800,,967,4.736526946107785

2783661,5,B000NVI2GU,Too bad they stopped at three seasons. This is a great series. Sure the dialogue is vulgar but it seems appropriate. I was disappointed by the ending of the last episode because it was very anticlimactic and depressing. There were some oddly inexplicable elements. Why write Wyatt and Morgan Earp in and do nothing with them? Why didn't Wu arm and bring his 150 Chinese into the mix earlier? Why have the doctor come down with TB when the series was ending soon anyway? Why write in the distracting subplots like those associated with the acting troop when it was meaningless to the main story line? Why didn't somebody just shoot Hurst with a rifle from a distance while he was standing on the roof of the hotel's porch?,1501113600,,721,4.596899224806202

2783665,5,B000NVI2GU,"This is great tv. I've never been the westerns type. This is kind of like watching a carousel going round and round. Now don't step away from the screen for a few minutes, in that time a new plot probably will be missed, trust me. Robin Wright played Calamity Jane incredibly. She really made me laugh a lot, which is rare on most shows. The character Seth Bullock played the part well until mid 2nd season and all of the 3rd. He barely said any lines in his scenes, just grimacing and staring off nonstop. The different writers let go of, or cut out his lines. Very strange. Anyway I loved the show, and there are great characters in it. Too many to write about. Enjoy.",1499385600,,670,4.325396825396825

2783670,1,B000NVI2GU,"I loved seasons 1 and 2, and would give them both 5 stars. Season 3 however, was in my humble opinion, just terrible. If I was the editor, I'd cut out about 9 episodes worth of meaningless nonsense and drivel, filled with characters that having nothing to do with the main story line. Then the remaining 3 episodes would earn 5 stars. I literally fast forwarded thru 75% of season 3, very disappointing.

The final episodes seemed to be leading up to a major showdown, the Pinkerton mob, the saloon owners mob and Mr. Wu's mob ready to do battle and then, nothing!  The theater troupe really had no real impact on the plot, it seemed like ""filer"" material, Sweringen killing one of his ""whores"" to placate Mr. Hearst did not make any sense plus a lot of other scenes and characters that added up to a disjointed and very uneven final episode.

To this purpose, I watched it multiple times through, including at least once with subtitles and once with the commentary on, which I also recommend. The series portrays the brutality and harshness of an illegal mining camp, but it also beautifully demonstrates how even in the most primitive settings the drive toward forming order and community prevails, which adds a captivating element to the series and to what would otherwise be a ruthless history.",1485734400,,575,5.0

2783829,4,B000NVI2GU,"I really enjoyed this series. The language obscenity-wise took some getting used to, but I understand that having the characters use profane language of the period would have had them indeed sounding like Yosetime Sam as one of the show's creators put it. Some of the characters were quite loquacious in their employment of language, and it was an immediate joy to hear them speak. Of course, the series delivers what every western should- quick and sudden gunplay. My only misgiving is because the show was cancelled before it's time the arcs of the various story lines were left uncompleted and some of the last parts dragged for me. In any case, having watched the series, I will be ready to enjoy any future incarnations of these characters in what ever forms they may take, films or otherwise.",1485561600,2,798,4.7898550724637685

2784086,1,B000NVI2GU,"Deadwood HAD IT BEEN COMPLETED AS A SERIES WITH A SEASON 4 would likely warrant a 4 or 5 star rating.  As it is, Amazon once again gives us a partial set of seasons to a show on PRIME, this time knowing full well that HBO never completed the series stopping production after 3 seasons never completing it with the 4th and final season.  No question, it is a gory, crude, brutal show representing the western frontier at its worst made to represent something that likely never was, but it was engaging in its raw brutality.  Sad thing is there is no waiting for Season 4, there is no measuring its overall quality because after building a compelling story with historical figures it just stops after season 3 leaving its viewers to be only disgusted and without any answers as to the outcome of any stories introduced.  Prime Video may be making some good productions of their own now, I wonder if they will stick it to us paying customers like they do in purchasing shows that were never completed?",1484524800,,998,4.527777777777778

It was however not a documentary on their lives but a mixture of truths and fiction.  I enjoyed it for the most part but felt it could have ended better.",1484352000,,474,4.674698795180723

2784158,3,B000NVI2GU,"good show overall,very disappointing 'final' season...storylines had great potential with strong characters,yet fell far short of what easily could have developed into several more seasons. The utter lack of western genre series being produced gave a unique niche opportunity had this show not been on an expensive channel like HBO,which the majority of us can't afford and would have prevented us from watching when it was still being run with original episodes. Only years later,through Amazon,was I able to finally see it...I'm guessing they lacked viewership,so they had to abruptly wind down the stories to a acceptable finish before cancellation....in so doing,I'm afraid they did sub-par work...had this been presented on a common channel like AMC,TNT,or even FX or USA,toned down, but not eliminated ,the gratuitous nudity and vulgarities while enhancing the number of famous era legendary people making even cameo appearances for a show or more....this series could have easily run 10 seasons or longer...too bad..",1483920000,2,1023,5.522292993630574

Deadwood probably has the best ensemble of experienced character actors in the Hollywood although, there's a good mix between the experienced and new.  Ian McShane is a powerful actor and his character dominates the program.  Powers Booth is such a consummate performer that he makes his character look easy and natural.

As far as the story line, it was interesting and well acted. I guess our pioneer forefathers couldn't string 3 words together without one of them being a cuss word. Mostly annoying and detracted from the story.",1481846400,,456,4.7

But if your delicate sensabilities are not so delicate, you will become addicted to this portrayal of life in a lawless town made up of citizens out to make a life and money on their own terms. Much of it takes place in three main drinking and gambling establishments, with two of them offering a small stable of ladies who earn their money in the rooms upstairs. There are plenty of dead bodies on Deadwood but not many funerals, when the pigs belonging to the Chinese laundry owner, Woo,  love them for a snack.

The way that they talk (profanity) was even too much for my husband at times, and he is a soldier in the Army! :D I find it funny though. They spit out cuss words that I never heard before in every day speech, I guess that's just how it was back then. It had a great story line and each episode left me wanting more.

The cinematography is excellent.  The actors were great except for Carradine who played his usual wooden caricature of any character he plays. That might be a little harsh since his only part was a headstone where two or three drunks go to pay their respects and vomit in season 3.
This is a very earthy series.  It is beyond gritty and satisfying.",1478304000,,560,4.8125

All characters portrayed have very convoluted stories of their own making each episode very engaging. I do wonder if the extreme use of profanity was common in that time with that caliber of people. There's drama, shock value, and some really funny moments and one-liners. I really wished it had continued for at least another season as it had left so many open ended stories.",1477526400,,622,5.107843137254902

2784574,5,B000NVI2GU,this is a terrific show with a wonderful cast  (unfortunately with one exception - tim olyphant - he had to wait until Justified to come into his own).  I really wish it had been allowed to continue through more seasons.  I would recommend it to anyone telling them to give themselves a couple of episodes to get accustomed to the constant barrage of terrible language.  Once you are no longer offended you can focus on the amazing character development in this show - My favorites - Ian McShane and then whoever plays the doctor - he is great.  Question - was life really so awful then?  Was it that easy to get away with murder?,1473724800,,630,4.434782608695652
2784575,5,B000NVI2GU,Is there anymore seasons? It seems that shouldn't be the end considering how season 3 ended. I want more!!!,1473724800,,107,4.684210526315789

2784578,5,B000NVI2GU,"All three season of Deadwood were masterpieces, an interesting mix of Shakespearean dialogue and a very black comedy. There really weren't any characters that weren't fascinating and well-acted-- from the Victorianesque Alma Garrett to the poetic Calamaty Jane to the knife-weilding Al Swearington. Yes, the casual viewer will need to get accustomed to the onslaught of profanities and gutted throats, but all of it has a purpose and are essential to the story.

As an added bonus, I found myself drawn to the intricate details of the sets and wardrobes. Extremely realistic with a minimum of cliches.",1473638400,,601,5.195876288659794
2784579,5,B000NVI2GU,Incredible series. No idea why it only lasted 3 seasons. Top notch acting performances from everyone.,1473638400,,101,5.375
2784580,5,B000NVI2GU,Great series! So sad it ended after season three!!,1473638400,,50,4.666666666666667
2784581,3,B000NVI2GU,"Well I did my homework and found as I suspected that the writer of Deadwood either was not aware or just did not care about the language being used.  Talked with an historian about the language and found that the language used in the series was not the type of language used in that day in Deadwood.  But I did find from visiting Deadwood this summer that the show gave Deadwood, SD a big boost.  I really do enjoy the history, just not all the terrible language being used.",1473638400,,474,4.303370786516854
2784582,5,B000NVI2GU,Loved the show--it had the most unique formula of speaking in a shakesperean manner with a heaping dose of cussing thrown in.,1473638400,,125,4.7272727272727275

2784589,5,B000NVI2GU,"Great story line and some wonderful characters that surprise you by not being stereotypical and predictable.  I just have no idea who the people are who decide to stop producing a series like this Deadwood.  At the end of three seasons you will be left wanting to learn more about all of the characters you have begun to love and hate, but then the pull the plug.  They stop producing this story to allow the he production of an inferior story that must provide some sort of greater monetary reward?  Such is life when art forms follow commercial greed.  Such is life in America where business is much, much more more important that the enjoyment of a good story.  Today is full of very good and sometimes great television.  I am just thankful that I can watch it on streaming services like Amazon to avoid the time-wasting commercials of network television.",1473552000,5,858,4.642384105960265

2784591,3,B000NVI2GU,"Most disappointing finale I've ever seen.  It seems to have been filmed with a fourth season in mind because it leaves way too many story lines open-ended.  Nothing is brought together to top it off and have closure on any of it.  Deadwood is good if you like westerns, but without a continuation of the story it kinda makes the whole third season all for nothing.",1473552000,,364,4.484848484848484
2784592,5,B000NVI2GU,"Deadwood Season 3 kicks of by developing a new villain in George Hearst. In a strange way, it strengthens the relationship between the series' main characters Seth Bullock and Al Swearengen, which is not too far from history.  The continued comic relief of Jane, EB, Wu and Swearengen are essential to my enjoyment of the series. Extremely entertaining!",1473465600,,353,5.086206896551724
2784593,4,B000NVI2GU,"I won't burst your bubble or give you any spoilers in saying that there are only 3 seasons of this excellent series, and the ending of the 3rd season leaves things hanging.  I assume they did not have a clue that they were being dropped (that was a mistake I think), and I have to say in my humble opinion this great series ends somewhat glumly.

2784597,4,B000NVI2GU,"Many people felt that the series finale was unfulfilling, but I feel that it ending was appropriate for the kind of show that it was. I do not think that a season 4 would have brought a sense of completion, because I do not think that it was that type of show. It seemed to me that the show was more about what life was like during that time in history in that place. Rather then there being one grand story that needed an ending, there were several stories;Every character had a story,and so it seemed to be more of a slice of American history in the Dakota territories during the latter part of the nineteenth century rather than a classic story. So no need to tie up loose ends..",1473465600,,682,4.253846153846154

You can tell at the end of season 3 it's meant to leave a cliffhanger to the next season. I did read that they are planning the release of two films to wrap up the series and give fans closure. I really hope that's true and if so I will definitely be watching them as I have no doubt countless other fans will be as well!

2784683,5,B000NVI2GU,"It's worth 5 stars. As far as quality of script writing and acting, it's there with the best of TV series, including ""Game of Thrones"" and ""Walking Dead."" There are no good guys or bad guys, just humans predating each other, showing humans as both good and bad; there are no super heroes. And lots of good dialogue. It's about life, the violent life of humans, and not just the physical aspect of it, but also the psychological. For me, the ending was realistic, but sad and anticlimactic--just like most of our lives are. So in that sense, it was about as perfect an ending as you could expect--remembering that this is a tale of a real mining camp in  the USA's 1870s Western Front, so in some degree, they had to stay true to history.",1471996800,,737,4.419117647058823

2784735,5,B000NVI2GU,"Deadwood is so wonderful. It's ironic that it got a lot of press at the time for its bad language, because it's the language (but not the swearing!) that I think really sets this show apart. Great actors and great plot, but it is the lyrical, Shakespearean quality of the dialogue that is the most delightful aspect. Gritty, tense, funny, a joy to behold.",1471910400,,355,4.5625

I am finding it much more difficult to follow and the introduction of so many new characters has only complicated the confusion and choppy story lines. It is a period piece and I do find the the scenery and backdrop very authentic....especially if you enjoy that period in time when our west was becoming settled, populated  and more civilized. The language is extremely graphic, but most likely authentic for that time period and the characters believable, if not, downright crude. All in all, somewhat interesting but not nearly as entertaining or engaging as ""Hell On Wheels"".",1470700800,,774,4.649635036496351

So, here goes again, for the last time.

My wife and I watched all three seasons of this series. The story line was great, the acting very good. But the gratuitous use of the aforementioned vulgarity significantly distracted from the overall series.

Neither of us is a prude, but the profanity went way over the edge, in our opinion. As a former U.S. Marine, believe me, I have heard my share of profanity, but even the drill instructors in boot camp knew SOME limits!

There were many fine actors in the series, and we have got to believe that, after a while, even they became tired of the gratuitous use of profanity with virtually every single line of dialogue.",1469923200,2,916,4.748427672955975

The last episode had no closure to the whole series and leaves you wondering 'what in the....??'  Ian McShane deserves a lot of credit for the tone of the show and how he managed to make his lines sound normal were no ordinary feat, with the kind of vernacular of that day making our sentences today look like Jack and Jill books.

I was expecting an violent and explosive ending given the build up, but received a different ending--which is ok.  That season is semi-historically correct from what little I read on-line.  Therefore, it has great characters, some authentic, others made up, but the acting was great and the story line always moving.

The nudity, bad and naughty language is  not the important issue compared to the taking of life the ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"" felt they had to do to further their causes. Too Many murder scenes i cannot say is ""Okay"" but Hollywood likes to try to ""shock"" the audience.
Defending one self with killing is one thing  but killing someone when the situation has nothing to do with defending oneself is disturbing.
No minors of course around when i viewed Deadwood.

Personally I think season one was a five star ( I know it had a lot to do with the great Walter Hill who directed the first show and  also a great actor My friend Keith C. )
Season two almost as good as one still worth five stars.
I truly feel had there been a Fourth season, it would have been a topnotch five star.
I'm just hoping for some kind of movie or special show, but I'm no holding my breath.
So was it worth watching yes season one & two, and maybe season 3.

2785624,5,B000NVI2GU,"All 3 seasons are great except for the final episode and how they ended the series, it seemed like the series executives put a gun to the writers heads and told them to end it NOW on a dime in this last episode, there were so many story lines that were just ended abruptly for the sake of doing so and others like introducing Wyatt & Morgan Earp to Sheriff Seth Bullock and then nothing? No more interaction? What were they thinking? They could have creatively and very easily went at least 1 more season or longer to tell the complete story or close the series out while still on top and not just leave the fans stranded and confused about what this series could have been. The last episode felt like the powers that be were no longer interested in what they were involved with and what they created and just wanted to move on, they could care less about the fans.........very sad way to end an other wise great series that only lasted 3 seasons.",1459209600,,947,4.3559322033898304

2785627,2,B000NVI2GU,"Very disappointing the final season. A lot of tension is built up over the final season as though there is going to be some final denouement, but disappointingly we have Swearingen put in the position of the tragic Greek character who sacrifices his daughter for the well-being of the polis. In this case however Swearingen does not rise to the task. He must sacrifice a woman who attempted to kill his nemesis, but instead of sacrificing her he picks an innocent victim to die in her place. This I find reprehensible.",1459209600,,518,4.7032967032967035

2785666,5,B000NVI2GU,This is a fascinating show that I've binge watched a few times from season 1 to 3. The show is historically accurate for the period based on research that I did on the town of Deadwood. The excessive F-bombs can be distracting until you get used to the language. If you don't swear and don't like hearing it this is not the show for you. By far the best series I have followed to date.,1458172800,,385,4.1466666666666665

2785710,5,B000NVI2GU,"This story line becomes more and more complicated as the cooperation of the main members of the community becomes unraveled by some. This is the last season and left me wanting more and a positive resolution. The violence, overt nudity, sex and vulgarity continues to increase as the outsiders grown in power. Most likely a truer view of the wild west as the territories begin to consume towns. Who can be trusted at any moment is uncertain and painful.
Semi Spoiler alert
This is a down hill journey for the community as the corrupt outsiders through any means consume the town. The end left me hanging as to what happens next.
NOTE - the internet says the vulgar language at the time was not what is used in the movie. A decision was made to include more current horrible vulgarity for impact - god darn just did't seem to have the same impact.",1457740800,,846,4.5359477124183005

2785821,5,B000NVI2GU,"In my opinion Deadwood is one of the pioneers, along with the Sopranos, in this latest golden era of scripted television.  It makes the antagonist the protagonist.  Al Swearengen (the local cutthroat, bully, pimp, what ever you want to call him) is probably the most sane character in the series.  Breaking Bad, The Americans, Sons of Anarchy, and the list goes on seems to follow this blue print.  Also the series knew when to take it's bow.  Three seasons.

2785876,4,B000NVI2GU,"This whole series has been tough to watch. I started because of Timothy Olyphant, but the whole ensemble is great. There is maybe one entirely likable character in the entire show. No spoiler here for that. Others are various degrees of impaired, imperfect, bad or evil. My review is a guarded one. It is honest, because it is life. The series probably ended where it should have, as the story arcs for the main characters were clear. But it is a horribly depressing show, really, because it is like real life. In the end, the 1%, and maximum evil and immorality, not just amorality, wins. That may be a true message, but it is a f&%k+*g downer. That it is another issue with the show. I got so tired of the ""F"" word, over and over and over again. I doubt the Wild West had a vocabulary even that limited. Laconic, maybe. Profane at all hazards, I doubt. And I am no prude. I just thought it was poor writing.",1455580800,,909,4.352941176470588

2786142,5,B000NVI2GU,"The one thing about Deadwood is that it never fails to please.  While Season 3 differs from 1 and 2 in that it centers primarily with George Hurst (Gerald McRaney).

Hurst comes to Deadwood after Mr. Garrett's claim hits a motherlode and dies from Dan pushing him off a ledge.  The season centers in Hurst's interruption of the camp and day to day operations.  Swearengen (Ian McShane) and Bullock (Timothy Olyphant) become unlikely allies.  Together they attempt to thawart Hurst's play against Alma's claim.

The season ends, sadly, with Hurst getting his way.  Rumor in 2016 speculates that a film or another series of episode will be produced to actually wrap up the program in a more tidy way.",1454198400,5,698,4.815126050420168

Read any review about this series.  It changed TV and it triggered many articles, responses, editorials, etc.
The writing, performances, plotting, amazingly accurate costumes and sets, all are marvelous.  The show changed how many folks see westerns.

2786171,5,B000NVI2GU,"Deadwood was a great show -- I only wish it didn't end when it did.  I like how real-life characters and facts were brought into the series, though much of the show is still very fictional.  I think season 3 went a little off kilter with one or two of the new story lines that it added.  They just didn't seem necessary and I felt like they were just filler. Characters and story lines were brought in that just weren't needed and weren't relevant to the original story lines in any way whatsoever.  So if I were to rate Season 3 against the first 2 seasons, it would be my least favorite.  But all-in-all, Deadwood was one of those shows that ended way to soon. The characters were strong and the actors portraying them did a  great job.  It was a disappointment to get to the end of the series. This would be a great show for anyone who likes westerns, but be prepared for a lot of strong (VERY STRONG) language and nudity.  After watching this series and reading reviews about Timothy Olyphant, I plant to watch the Justified series next.",1453680000,3,1041,4.385416666666667

2786271,4,B000NVI2GU,"Slower than the first two seasons. From what I read, if it's accurate, the writer went off the wagon and became sloppy, and therefore the season ended thanks to HBO shenanigans, which I don't care about right now.
I don't know the purpose of the theater people - they added nothing to the story, and like someone else pointed out, Tolliver does nothing but rant and rave. I was hoping to see more storyline with Joni (or is it Jodi?). She's intriguing to watch.
Anyway...I got to see the series thanks to Amazon Prime...just wish it didn't end as it did.",1452211200,,554,4.4950495049504955

For some reason the idiots at HBO decided to not pick up the show for its 4th season. So instead of having a proper send off this show ended like it was coming back. Tons of plot lines left unfinished, and leaves you feeling unfulfilled in the end.",1449446400,,408,4.177215189873418
2786276,3,B000NVI2GU,"Such a great t.v. show.  My husband and I were hooked from the get-go.  Who doesn't love Ian McShane and Timothy Olyphant working together?  The gritty characters, plots and subplots working together in the Old West backdrop were fun, fast paced and satisfying.  Adult soap opera at its most entertaining.  A whole new vocabulary we found difficult to keep from sliding into our everyday!  Sexuality was still overt and overdone but was not as grotesquely overdone like other would be epic shows such as Game of Thrones (the sex on that show made me literally nauseous).  I was rating this show a spectacular 5 stars all the way until..... the last episode.  I mean, I saw that there weren't many episodes left until the season ended began to wonder how the show could possibly pull it together but... wow.  The last episode just.. just... well.  They just dropped the ball.  It's almost like they all showed up on set and decided to do .. nothing.  I have never seen the worst season ender in all my life.  I looked at my husband and looked at his face.  He'd never seen a worse season ender.  Seriously.  Why did they bother?  I want all my time back for this season.  That CAN'T be the ending.  It can't.  I don't want to give spoilers so I won't.  But believe me when I say... anyone could have dreamed up a better ending than that.  I gave it three stars for the fantastic acting, the great costumes, the great sets, the great photography, the great story lines & character development and for keeping my husband and I entertained for so long- but for that ONE horrific ending, you are lucky I only took two stars!  Shame on whomever did that to such a remarkable cast of people.",1449360000,,1684,4.503311258278146
2786277,5,B000NVI2GU,"Deadwood is one of the best series produced by HBO IMHO. It is also one of my favorites. We have watched the entire series 3 times doing so once every couple of years. It is a great story line with a lot of action and it seems to realistically follow life in the old west in a gold rush area. The story is based on true characters and real life adventures.

What makes the series so good is not only the storyline but the very high quality of acting.  If you like westerns then this is a great series for you. It is full of crude language and and the harsh realities of the wild times which it depicts.  It is a rough story so if you don't like that type of story then you may want to pass on this one. If you like good realistic stories then this is an excellent series to watch.

This is the third and final season and the action and climax to the story is very good. I enjoyed it so much that I have watched it over and over. I watched this using my Amazon Prime Account.",1449360000,,974,3.9794871794871796

2786598,5,B000NVI2GU,"Wonderful series...
I wrote this same review for season 2, sorry for the repetition but it says it all...
  Shakespeare meets Greek tragedy, meets the past lifestyle where I live now.  I live in the central Colorado mountains where in the same time period the identical search for the color (more silver than gold) was going on.  I care take 4 old mining claims up at 10,000 ft. elevation and counting, with 2, old log cabins that are 100 plus years old, ruins of old small settlements and evidences of the mines. I find myself imagining what life must have been like there and down in the nearest towns.  This whole series paints a wonderful glimpse into what I know and have heard my area of the Rockies was like.
  I am a woodworker and have Friends in the movie industry.  It is all illusion created for entertainment but this series creates a great one an all ways from sets, writing , directing and of course acting.
  Watch and then watch again.  I watched for my second time with my room mate while working in Antarctica.  She had not seen it and quickly became addicted. I want more of this series...",1443139200,,1109,4.462686567164179

For realism, production value, characters and acting qualities, this series has it all. I was however, saddened by the lack of satisfactory ending that occurred, I understand, due to contract disputes etc. and that is understandable. That said, I would recommend this show to anyone who could tolerate the excess profanity. The writer David Milch explained his reasoning for this but I still don't think that much was necessary to convey one's manliness to others in such a vocal fashion and that was the main reasoning.",1443139200,,667,5.018018018018018

If one were to filter out the profanity from the dialogues, I think you would have a near compilation of Shakespeare's comedies, and tragedy's.

2786695,1,B000NVI2GU,"I don't give it one star for the offense nature of the content, or the massive degrading of all types of people especially women.  Mind you I am not talking about the hooker scenes, but how seemingly strong women capitulate into stereotypes.  The dialog seems good at first but you realize, later on, that they are often and casually using present ""sayings"" and modern lingoes.  The acting is ok, but definitely wains with time.  The 1st season has a good story, but after there it slowly turns into a train wreck.  The show was cancelled early so expect a monumental unresolved ending, if you make that far.  Basically every thing they work towards and struggle to achieve throughout seasons 2 and 3, the basically walk away from when they could have won it all.  Very disappointing!  Also the main character Sheriff Bullock, in season 1, is considered to be uncorruptable and the only bastion of justice in this wilderness town, however in the next two season he capitulates time and time again. He does things he have shot a man for doing in the first season.  Furtheremore, he uses his position to bully others into what he wants.  Something he talks against in the first season.  I do not recommend as you wade through several episodes of sleaze with the underpinning of the ends justify the means. Only to find that the characters a just going to give up.

Ian McShane delivers phenomenal performances in all 36 episodes, and is unbelievably entertaining in portraying Al Swearengen.

I'm sure there are those that say it plays to the authenticity of the time, but I strongly disagree. I think what lends to the authenticity of the era is the attitudes of the people and how well the actors and directors portray that.

They tried too hard to have fancy dialog and it got boring very quickly. I found myself using the fast forward button through the long winded parts, usually when E.B. Farnum was talking. I rarely use this fast forward button. This was one of the first shows where I've used it to get through the long winded dialog.

The characters seemed to be drawn from ""real life"", including E.B. Farnum. No character was all good, or all bad, just human. We really only know how it was in the 1800 - 1900's from movies & TV.

The main thing? The series ends, at Season Three! No mention if it continues to season Four!
Timothy Olyphant, is a good actor, as he was in the U.S. Marshal series, of which also ended early! No Season Six, without paying?

By Season 3, we did not even watch the entire season. Don't get me wrong, I am hardly a Puritan but the filthy language in this series just got to be too much. I usually think that a few curse words at key parts of the story add a little spice and humor.

2787328,4,B000NVI2GU,"With the exception of modernized vocabulary, a historical redemption of the gold rush boom town, Deadwood, SD. Written in a prose-like style with the occasional use of iambic pentameter, it's as much art, as it is a shoot 'em up drama. I gave it only four starts because I felt the overuse of certain modernized and vulgar language was to the point of distraction. While the wild west certainly had it's usage of ""bad words"", it was overkill. Certain curse words incorporated for affect were to the point of being comedic. The story line is very good and overall very well written. It provided insight to ""wild west"" characters that we've all heard of. (Wild Bill Hickok and Calamity Jane, many others). Sadly, the series was cancelled after the third season. So the story is cut short of having a final conclusion.",1437004800,,815,4.746478873239437

2787335,5,B000NVI2GU,"Al Swearingen!  the second-most-complicated character in TV history (besides Tatiana Maslany in ""Orphan Black""...what?..at last count she plays...like...8 different continuing, nuanced, totally-different, true-to-life characters??!!!...NUTS!!)  I started watching Deadwood b/c I finished ""Justified"" and needed an Olyphant fix.  But as Timothy Olyphant has stated before, his Deadwood lead character Seth Bullock is way cool but doesn't have nearly the number of interesting sides that Raylan Givens has in Justified.  And they never let him do ""funny"" with Seth - crying shame!  What kept me riveted through Deadwood seasons 1, 2 and 3 was Al Swearingen, who just when you thought you had his character's contours mapped and compartmentalized, spreads his wings in just a little different - albeit very important and necessary for the plot development of the show - direction.  And normally with just the slightest facial movements.  You never know exactly what's going to happen properly with Al Swearingen in any given show, and whatever he finally does always makes sense.  When it occurs in the context of a riveting story with many other very good performances, THAT is great writing.  And Ian McShane's acting just nails it.
Then, of course, there are other reasons that set Deadwood apart from any other show in the history of TV:  1) it's the most swearing show ever - period.  And it all seems natural given the environment.  But just riding along while the writers plumb the depths of TV profanity is worth the ride.  But then there are lots of other things, like...what show has EVER had a severed head play a significant supporting role (the Indian chief's head that Swearingen claims his is about to send off but never does, keeping it instead for his adverse, self-mocking, consternation muse)?  Too fun!  And then the dialogue...amazing...Deadwood is the closest thing to an attainable Shakespearean western.
If you can take the language heat and bloody body count but have not yet watched Deadwood, you really need to treat yourself to this amazingly blunt yet nuanced show!",1436832000,13,2091,5.218562874251497

Watched with Amazon Prime on demand instead of having to wait a week between episodes or 9 months between seasons, which would have been an unhappy circumstance.

The story arcs were invested with much screen time,but some, as with the acting company diversion, were worthless and likely the cause of the viewer decline that forced HBO to execute the entire series. This was a fantastic series that lost its way. Olyphant was a disappointment when measured by his turn in Justified, where he was superb. Ian McShane was the anchor for Deadwood. So many worked with focus to make this an epic series and the writers/producers dropped the ball. Lost Opportunity would have been a better name for this series.",1435190400,7,584,4.792079207920792

2787458,5,B000NVI2GU,"Throughout its run, Deadwood was a quirky series filled with eccentric characters. With dialog sourced in equal parts from Shakespeare and a football locker room, commercialized sex and nudity, graphic violence, and substance abuse in the extreme, it was like no other western on television, before or since. But in the third season, the denizens of Deadwood coalesced into an incredibly amoral, dysfunctional family in response to an invading battalion of armed thugs in the employ of the wealthy psychopath, George Hearst. Gerald McRaney played Hearst as a man so evil that he spits in the face of one of his employees (twice!) and tells him he'd better not see him later, having wiped it off. While no one would mistake Deadwood for a comedy, the dialog was often hysterically funny, if you could only follow what they were saying. I have no idea why HBO decided to overplay it's hand with the actors, but the result was an unexpected termination after three spectacular seasons. Sorely missed, and highly recommended.",1434412800,2,1021,5.011764705882353

I do like westerns, gunfights, brawls, and general obnoxiousness in some shows --- BUT this show has GREAT DIALOGUE and cool historic references (sometimes accurate, sometimes not -- that, for history junkies like me, some truly enjoy!

Bullock, Swearengen, Alma Russell Ellsworth, and Hearst all charge into one final hoo-rah! This season effectively sets up the next season for even bigger events, but alas, that never happened. Instead, we are left with a bunch of what-ifs and how-comes. We are left wanting more.

Do I dare say that this ending ruins the whole series? It makes you want to scream! So unfair! There was so much more to Deadwood and the people who lived their historically. The story could have spun into Bullock's time as an every day Joe, hanging out with Theodore Roosevelt, or the huge fire that destroyed a good portion of Deadwood and it's rebuilding. With so many promises of a reunion series or even movies to give us a proper finale, many of us stood by for years. Now in 2015, that seems really unlikely.

This whole series is worth the watch. Just know that it ends well, but leaves you wanting to see the townspeople get their revenge. It leaves you wondering what the people did outside of Deadwood after their departures. It leaves you wanting..... we can only hope the HBO execs see these reviews and give it another go or give us a proper send off with a tie-in movie.",1433894400,,1341,4.425101214574899

2787507,5,B000NVI2GU,"Deadwood is my favorite television program of all time. It is dark, witty, realistic, thoughtful, spectacularly cast, and superbly written. If you have any interest in Westerns, or in historical fiction in general, you owe it to yourself to give it a chance. Yes, the language is coarse. Yes, the show is violent (sometimes gruesomely so). But consider the time in history that the show portrays, and its setting. Deadwood is magnificent, and its only downfall is that it ended in the third season--one more season, and it would have achieved perfection.",1433721600,,554,5.032608695652174

2787516,5,B000NVI2GU,"Yes, I too am sorry this series ended so soon. Even though I didn't get to watch it till it came on Prime, I enjoyed every minute of it--swearing/violence and other stuff aside. This series had many moments--love Calamity Jane giving a school lesson to the children in school; --the death of Bullock's adopted son (actually, his brother's)-----the insane power plays----and there are a lot of them. Even more, was how close to actual history some of the events in this series enveloped as it went along. Want to know what happened to some of the main/major characters--look them up. In fact, look up and read the history of Deadwood, it was a major point on the time line of Western History. Hearst, Bullock, Swearenger, were all real and butted heads frequently in the Deadwood years.
What was great about this series, it did not ""pretty-up"" the west. The West was not pretty as Hollywood would love you to believe--it was messy, dirty, ugly, violent, mean---Hollywood never did get it right--a lot of ""heroes"" were outlaws also.

2787735,5,B000NVI2GU,Watched this when it was on HBO.  It is even better the second time around.  Streaming it is great as you can pause and review at any point - something yoiu couldn't do on HBO until DVRs were around etc.  A lot of historical figures in the drama.  Some artistc license takens especially concerning George Heart's character.  Still an exciting and interest portrait of Deadwood during the gold rush and the displacement of the native inhabitants.

2787742,4,B000NVI2GU,"This has been an enjoyable series to watch, once you get used to the very foul language used for every third word.  It is interesting to see how it weaves real history into the fiction and gives you a great idea of what it might have been like in a mining camp back then.  There really isn't much about the actual mining or miners though, except for a few mentions of them and occasional images of mining operations.

2787804,5,B000NVI2GU,"A quasi-historical series  that displays a depiction of the old west with all of its warts. I found the ""bad-ass pimp"" guy to be more of a ""hero"" than the figure of George Hearst. George Hearst was the father of William Hearst, a successful miner and businessman who went on to become a U.S. Senator ... even in those days ""polite circles"" welcomed the wealthy scoundrels. Nothing like a little union busting to gladden the heart.

Many of the characters in the series have historical basis, Al Swearengen (real life pimp), Wild Bill Hickock, Wyatt Earp, Seth Bullock, George Hearst, Sol Star, Charlie Utter, E.B. Farnum, and Calamity Jane to name a few.

Recommended for your pleasure, but with the awareness that there is excessive violence and foul language.",1427760000,,761,4.883720930232558

Some may be put off by the way the script writers used old english but for me that was just another reason to watch it more than once. Take note that this is a very gritty (and I have read a true) account of life in the Old West. If like me you despair at  the political corruption of today at least you can now rest in the knowledge that its nothing new!! I particularly found the whole process (and accompanying dirty tricks and corruption) that a camp went through becoming an official part of an early Dakota territory fascinating.
My favorite characters were the ""good guys"". The Doc, Calamity Jane, the Sheriff etc etc. Even the mean Al Swearengen shows a more human side in the end.

Hurst was willing to go to any means necessary to gain control of Alma Garrett's claim.  It's obvious that the writers and producers intended for there to be at least one more season, because the finale wasn't really final at all, and didn't really wrap everything up neatly.

The downfall was that the series ends at season 3 and leaves you hanging.  It was poor to end the Sopranos by fading to black but this doesn't even finish.  There were obviously meant to be other seasons but were not produced.  The big end of season climax is there to hook you for next year but there is no next year.  Don't bother to get too into the characters because it will hurt all that much more when it leaves you flat.  Could have used this review before starting season 1.",1426636800,,613,4.371681415929204

But in fairness most of the women in the camp are hard core hookers.. All that said, the complexity of the relationships and the dialogue between characters is unparalleled . I once said that at times it reminded me of Shakespearean comedy and after completing the series I went to look for reviews and that is exactly how a top media reviewer portrayed it.

The foul language was pretty surprising but I could over look it as the show itself was outstanding.

2787960,5,B000NVI2GU,"All three seasons of this series were excellent in every way. Unlike many westerns, Deadwood required careful listening and needed to be watched a number of times to really comprehend what was going on and what was being said. The language used was complicated and almost Shakespearean in its rhythms, the character development was complex (as humans are). No one was completely good or bad, with the possible exception of children. As the series progressed, all the characters showed courage, cowardice, nobility and baseness. There were frequently disasters that resulted from the best possible motives. There was deterioration and elevation of all the characters. All three seasons make this one of the several best series ever on television, in all facets (writing, acting, casting- even multiple casting, casting against type, plotting, historical accuracy, sets, costumes). I put it right up there at the top along with Breaking Bad, Mad Men, the Wire. Rome, Game of Thrones. My only reservations are that it didn't run for more than three seasons",1425254400,,1053,5.236686390532545

Molly Parker is similarly awful, but at the other end of the spectrum.  A dead codfish has a broader range.  But happily, Ian McShane more than makes up for the shortcomings in those two cast members.  His dialogue is hilarious, at times poignant, and always delivered with perfect timing.

During the last few months when most shows on TV were reruns or not-so-specials my wife and I decided to give this series a try and watched all 3 seasons via Amazon Prime streaming. The cast of actors playing the characters were familiar from other shows I watch (Justified, Breaking Bad, Ray Donovan and others). It was a good western with good stories and plot lines. The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is that the dialogue was sometimes hard to follow because it seemed some characters lines were spoken like a Shakespeare play.",1424390400,,625,4.539823008849558

BEWARE, for after three seasons the actor who played the main protagonist left the show to star in a network series (that flopped), causing the story to be truncated.  You will get no ending to this great story.  If you can live with that, you will love this series.

There is enough brevity of character development where you can see the successes and failures of various characters which made the show more interesting.  Oddly i began to ""root"" for many of the antagonistic characters and find empathy and sympathy for them.  Ian McShane, hands down, has become my new favorite actor and the show really rotated around him.  I didn't like all the racism and foul language in the show.

8181579,4,B000NVI2GU,"The discs come in a folding cardboard and plastic contraption, the type of contraptions HBO has used for many years and is still using on series like Game of Thrones. I don't like folding contraptions, but the discs play fine.

If you have a low tolerance for swear words avoid Deadwood.

I really liked the look and feel of the first season when the main protagonists moved to Deadwood to make their fortune in the hardware business. But the series didn't make it onto my great series list because the third season has a terrible ending. The bad guy wins and the good guys lose. The bad character gets away with killing an innocent little girl, and many others. The good guy protagonist turns out to be impotent and the camp is left as lawless at the end of the series as it was in the beginning. There is no worthwhile character or story arc, no good conclusion.

I devour fiction, especially fantasy and science fiction. If you like sci-fi you might like a couple of space race shows. I spent a month on a space race binge. First I read Space by James A. Michener. Then I watched two movies, The Right Stuff (1983) and Apollo 13 (1995), and then two great series, From Earth to the Moon (1998) and The Astronauts Wives Club (2015). Theyre a great combination.

If the above shows don't sound interesting here are a few of the series I really enjoyed watching more than once. I love good miniseries like Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002) and The 10th Kingdom (2000) because they have beginnings, middles and endings, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lost (2004-2010), Merlin (2008-2012), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek The Original Series (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish, or the hundreds of other fantasy and science fiction shows Ive watched.

If you like reading try some of my favorite fantasy and sci-fi authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1520812800,,2586,5.044496487119438
