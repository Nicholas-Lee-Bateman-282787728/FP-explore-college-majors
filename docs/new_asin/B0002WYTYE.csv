The story begins in a prison in Northern Ireland. One prisoner finds hidden supplies, he builds a bomb to escape from a hole in the wall! Next there is a hidden bomb at a university in Boston. A police bomb expert disables it just in time! He suffers from the strain. Elsewhere there is a tavern in Boston, we see the escaped prisoner (who watches the bomb expert on TV). This bomber calls to get information on the police bomb expert. We see a party for people. Later there is a bomb explosion! The police bomb expert teaches others his skills. That bomber gets a job as a janitor in police headquarters! [No security checks?] We now know who the bad guy is, and the good guy, so the drama comes from seeing when the police catch the bad guy.

Will a bomb be placed in a police vehicle? Can they be warned in time? What was the purpose in this? That bomber calls the police bomb expert! [Believable? No Caller ID?] Will Leos wife and children be targeted? There is a personal motive for revenge here. The identification of the bomber will help in the search. Jimmys father makes contact with someone for information on Gaerity. But he is discovered and attacked! His son rushes to his rescue and finds him tied up and booby-trapped with a bomb! We see another dramatic event. Jimmy is upset. His wife tells him who was at the beach house. Gaerity cooks up some chemicals at home. Leo finds a clue, will this lead him to Gaerity? There is more conversation and drama. [Incredible?] There is fight with cartoon-ish action.

Can Leo be rescued in time? Will there be explosions to wake up anyone who is dozing? We see the rockets red glare and other fireworks. Will Leos wifes car have a bomb planted in it? Can Leo reach their car and dismantle the bomb? Can the crowd be dispersed? Who are you? And so the good guys win in the end.

This is not a good story because of its somewhat unbelievable features (such as a too complex bomb fuse at the end). The more complex the mechanism, the more likely something can or will go wrong. I guess they thought it would improve the story. Given the recent bombing on Patriots Day (April 19) this may not be an amusing movie. You can decide otherwise. Patriots Day is a Massachusetts state holiday that commemorates the Battles of Lexington and Concord.",1431648000,,2315,4.465721040189125
