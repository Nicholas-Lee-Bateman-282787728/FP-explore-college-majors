The music isn't so great the moves are pretty much alot of plyo jumps,fast squats,and double jumping jacks. The latter being the less of the three moves. I was dissapointed. I think that Cardio Burn, and Maximum Cardio was fun and motivating. I think this workout was like going to the dentist. You really don""t want to do it but you must if you want to stay looking good!!!",1166659200,4,524,4.357142857142857
8361886,5,630581774X,"The Firm has just re-released this title on VHS and DVD as Calorie Killer 2.  And a calorie killer workout it is. I did this workout 3 times so far and each time my HRT says I burned 400-450 calories and I weigh 130 pounds! That's alot for a 45 minute workout. There is alot of high impact moves, so not a workout for weak knees. If you can handle the high impact this is a great cardio/light toning workout in 45 minutes.",1069372800,,422,4.0843373493975905
8361887,5,630581774X,"I think that Power Cardio is The FIRM's best Cardio series workout.  The moves are easy to follow and Dale Brabham gives fantastic instruction.  The ab section is definately the best of the three Cardio videos.  This one focuses mostly on the upper body, but doesn't totally neglect the lower half.  Lots of Plyo-jumps!  Almost all of the aerobics is high-impact so it's not for weak knees.  GREAT workout!",1002758400,9,406,4.811594202898551
