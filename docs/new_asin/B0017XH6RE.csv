8267785,5,B0017XH6RE,"This was a new way to use the treadmill, very effective to get your cardio time in, too much joking if your going to hear it a hundred times, but you could memorize it and play your own music.",1398816000,,192,3.948717948717949
8267786,5,B0017XH6RE,"Someone mentioned a C25K program--what is this and where might I get it?  I workout on a treadmill several times a week and I am looking for good programs to follow so I can easily work intervals and strength training into my walks.
Thanks.",1396828800,,240,4.454545454545454
8267787,4,B0017XH6RE,"What a unique idea! Just jump on your treadmill and she has you doing squats, sideways lunges, upper body with dumbbells and max out the incline for great cardio! I loved it! On the downside - she jokes around too much with her sister (who is on a treadmill next to her) and they sometimes get a little annoying.",1342051200,,312,4.305084745762712
8267788,4,B0017XH6RE,"I enjoyed this workout...added some much needed variety to my treadmill workout.  Really loved the intervals of mountain climbing with upper/lower body work.  Some parts are a little tricky - particularly the side lunges on the treadmill, but the workout definitely makes you work and sweat.  Thumbs all the way up!",1318982400,,315,5.137254901960785
8267789,5,B0017XH6RE,"At first, I didn't get the criticism of the reviewer who said if you use it with a treadmill, it may be beneficial.  Well, yes, if you are doing the non-treadmill option, you won't get much of a workout I'm afraid.  That said,  it is essentially a treadmill workout and, as such, it is phenomenal.  My heart rate was at rates I normally achieve with running only (150-160, near my peak fat burning and cardio endurance rates).  And to answer said reviewer, why do free weights on the treadmill - it increases your heart rate/exertion by 12% - which is what helps in fat burning.  In any event, I use the treadmill for my C25K program, and I occasionally fall of the wagon or need a break, I have bad knees...this is the perfect way not to lose progress in my fitness goals in the meantime. I also suggest a Surfshelf if you don't have your treadmill in front of the TV, I put my Polaroid DVD player on it and play this video...works great (also bought at Amazon). Bring a towel.",1275696000,,978,4.346153846153846
8267790,2,B0017XH6RE,"If you intend to use this video while walking on a treadmill, it may be beneficial. Otherwise, it is very annoying: There are 3 exercisers who walk at a differnet pace. One on the floor and 2 on treadmills. It is very difficult to keep a constant pace as the camera shifts from one to the other and accordingly, the pace changes. The idea of using weights while on a treadmill  is fine, but why do it? It is not a very useful muscle strengthener and the cueing is practically non-existent. I wish I knew why the participants seem so annoyingly happy all the time, while I had a hard time following them.
I have scores of videos which I use daily. This is one of the worst I came across. Don't buy it if you don't intend to use it with a treadmill!",1244764800,7,747,4.1875
8267791,5,B0017XH6RE,"I really enjoy doing this workout; there are segment changes every 30, 45, 60 seconds, which keeps me from getting bored.  Starts off with a warm-up, climbing hills, lunges (done with the pace turned down), lunges with a back leg lift, weights are used, and it has a good cool down. No running. For me, this is a keeper.",1221350400,6,320,4.423728813559322
