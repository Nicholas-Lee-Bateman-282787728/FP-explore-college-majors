2989132,1,B000WPFAKI,"My partner saw this on Amazon and rented it since we loved Paris is Burning.
We thought that this documentary would be maybe as good so we were excited to watch it.

Boy were we wrong.

Since Paris is Burning we have seen the growth, richness, talent, individuality,
charismatic, charming, caring and the beauty of Drag Queens in all shapes and sizes.
Instead of being the butt of a joke Drag Queens are being more accepted and respected
as you can see in movies and on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/RuPaul-s-Drag-Race-Season-4/dp/B007W2MKFM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">RuPaul's Drag Race: Season 4</a>&nbsp;or
any of RuPaul's shows.

Spoiler Alert:

This film looks as if someone put an AD in the Village Voice
asking for old film footage from any Drag Balls or Drag Queens.
Pepper LaBeija is listed in the film but we only get a glimpse
of Pepper in a wheelchair. Pepper died in 2003 this film is 2006.
I don't think Pepper expected anyone to sell a picture of her like that.
(I'm saying that as one who has been in a wheelchair, scooter and
living with AIDS for 30 years).

This film makes no sense; you don't care about the characters because
you never get to know them. There is no storyline just clips thrown together.
I could go on but I'm so bored with this rip off I'll end with one note.

If you want to see a great movie about the true lives and people of NYC Drag Balls
then you've got to see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Paris-Is-Burning/dp/B007C95S9K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Paris Is Burning</a>!",1344556800,8,1603,5.291338582677166
2989133,5,B000WPFAKI,What an absolutely fabulous sequel/ follow up to Paris is Burning! It's great to see the Ball scene still going strong!!!,1328140800,5,121,4.809523809523809
2989134,4,B000WPFAKI,"I really like the dvd, I just wanted to see more of the old members, and to find out who's the generation..........let me know if there's more available.....",1265500800,2,157,4.642857142857143
2989135,5,B000WPFAKI,This is one of the best documentaries I have seen about the Ball community since Paris is Burning. Wolfgang Busch provides a real intimate look at members of the Ball community who some has succumbed to HIV and has passed on or those living with it and educating the GLTB community. The voguing in this documentary is outstanding and becomes an inspiration to anyone in the arts field (like myself) whose passion is dance. I would recommend How do I look to anyone. I hope to see more coming soon.,1259280000,2,497,4.533333333333333
2989136,5,B000WPFAKI,"This documentary about the NY Ballroom community brings all of the spectacular visions to entertain but also gives the people being filmed the opportunity to share their strength and wisdom with film viewers. Differing viewpoints on the ball experience, in the ny community and being POz, Gay. Appreciated hearing differing values, self concepts and generational experiences from gender variant women. A Lesbian wins House Mother of the Year for the first time and that was cool. History of Balls extra gives excellent historical information and cultural context. Loved it.",1228435200,3,573,5.449438202247191
2989137,3,B000WPFAKI,"This film seemed like it was trying to be a follow-up to Paris is Burning, but it just really missed something.  I fell asleep watching it.  The best thing about it is that you get updated on various figures from Paris is Burning.  I found the interview segments with Octavia St. Laurent to be the most compelling.  In 'Paris', she was full of hope and dreams, but by the time of 'How Do I Look' life had happened and her views and experiences are very much changed.  But without 'Paris is Burning' setting you up, this documentary would just pretty much just suck.",1443484800,2,565,4.446601941747573
2989138,5,B000WPFAKI,"A much less intimate look than ""Paris is Burning"" but a very true look at the modern day ballrooms. it was wonderful seeing some old friends many of who have since passed.

What could have been leaps and bounds in helping viewers understand about the cultural significance of the ball scene and how the scene at times became commercialized by voices outside of the community, the Director elected to venture down a misguided road in constructing mise-en-scene.

2989165,5,B000WPFAKI,This is a decent overview of the history of the Ballroom scene in New York.

I've always taken note of runway or bitch tracks, but for a long time didn't realize many of them were directly born out of this underground culture.

2989175,5,B000WPFAKI,"I recently re-watched ""Paris is burning"" and then I rented this. Twenty years separate the action in these two films: we see the evolution of all the art forms affiliated with the balls, as well as huge difference a generation makes in HIV/AIDS awareness.

2989176,2,B000WPFAKI,"Though this movie is still worth a look, by being an unofficial companion to ""paris is burning,"" there is a lot to live up to. That documentary has an almost effortless quality, getting to the reality and personalities of each of it's characters with an unparalleled ease. This successor at times seems forced, without a real logic behind why the subjects are special or why the ball scene still holds our attention. It's as if the director's vision was too broad. Maybe there was so much to tackle that a sole topic couldn't be picked. Still, its worth a look. You get to catch up with several familiar faces and see where these great underground artists have found themselves later.",1346889600,3,684,4.708333333333333

That documentary has an almost effortless quality, getting to the reality and personalities of each of it's characters with an unparalleled ease. This successor at times seems forced, without a real logic behind why the subjects are special or why the ball scene still holds our attention. It's as if the director's vision was too broad. Maybe there was so much to tackle that a sole topic couldn't be picked. Still, its worth a look. You get to catch up with several familiar faces and see where these great underground artists have found themselves later.",1346889600,3,684,4.708333333333333
8225033,4,B000WPFAKI,"A pretty good documentary, something everyone should watch at least once...

Overall, it was a good documentary. It gives you a look into ball room origins and more. Unfortunately, a little over half way through it started losing my interest (interesting parts come and go). Its hard not to compare it to Paris is Burning and perhaps thats part of the problem

What to expect:
Learning about the history of houses and ball room names origin, how balls are judged, stories of how people began in the houses/came to rise as house mothers, transition stories, creativity, costumes, third gender discussion, self-destruction due to lack of support, how times have changed, the family support in the houses, some voguing/competitions, HIV/AIDS impact, icons/legends of the ball scenes who have passed away, and more.

I would recommend watching this at least once. Go in with an open mind and youll learn something.
What I see for the future of this film, along with Paris is Burning: they are sure to be legendary/historical films fifty years from now (how can they not be?).",1522368000,,1071,4.972067039106145
