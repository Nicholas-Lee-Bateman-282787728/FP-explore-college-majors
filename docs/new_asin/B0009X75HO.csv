8069340,5,B0009X75HO,"The dvd deals with military atrocities and the absurdities of borders and conflicts. Kang Sang-byeong is a member of the South Korean Marine Corps who is eager to shoot a North Korean spy. One evening he shoots and kills a South Korean civilian who has strayed into a forbidden zone to have sex with his girlfriend. Kang and the girlfriend of the dead civilian both have mental breakdowns. The woman believes the members of the coast guard are her dead lover, and engages in sexual affairs with them. Though commended after the shooting, Kang is dismissed from the coast guard. He then returns to kill other members of his troop. In the end he goes to Seoul and kills people at random with his bayonet. Great movie.",1374624000,,715,4.637795275590551

8069342,4,B0009X75HO,"Guided for the certainess that to kill a spy is the greatest honor, the soldier Kang Hang chul waits anxiously for a chance to prove his merits as soldier.

One night, when mistakenly shoots a civil innocent the tragedy will emerge and eventaually involve both sides of the this horrid fact. On one hand, the awful madness of the victim's lover and on the another one, the hallucianting paranoia that will take away him out of this rational world.

Kim Ki Duk proves, once more, why he is one of the top directors around the world. Creativity,originality and audacious about a controversial issue that has to do with both Koreas.

Watch it without reserves.",1301270400,2,657,4.745614035087719
8069343,3,B0009X75HO,"A reviewer questioned whether soldiers who guarded cost line to shoot anything  moves after dusk? well.. Certainly not as long as my own experience is concerned.( I served in a GP which was located in DMZ) However, I heard quite few heresays about the island Kim Ki Duck portrays (he precisely mentioned the island and outfit of the units ,but every Koreans know where it is and who they are . They are ROK marines). It is fairly dangerous place that is pretty close to the North Korean costline.

Kim Ki Duk tries hard to show how the intangible repressiveness of the military slowly turn the protagonist as the embodiment of violence. Does the director succeed to reveal the true chracter of violence and the nature of military that legimitizes the violence and even rewards it?  I don't think so.  Kim Ki Duk failed at both of his bifurcated efforts to symbolize and at the same time  make the movie as real as possible. He seems to miss the very point he forcefully attempt to show to audience because of his stylistic vacillation. Main motives Kim Ki Duk uses are very familiar to most Koreans who went through years of Military dictatorship .During that time, absurd propaganda that ceaselessly conveys the demonized image of so-called ""enemies"" and they all knew how ridiculous that is ,but the truth is we know the nature of those evils too well and we don't want any movie that reminds them by extremely exaggerated means. Nice try ,but Kim Ki Duk misses too many things in the movie.",1216166400,3,1493,4.661596958174905
8069344,3,B0009X75HO,"Did you know that South Korea's coastline is monitored by soldiers that, after dusk, shoot anybody in sight in order to prevent the infiltration of spies? I didn't, but I learnt that peculiar fact after watching ""The Coast Guard"" (2002).

""The Coast Guard"" is directed by Kim Ki-duk, a South Korean already well-known for previous art house movies ripe with symbolism. In this case, Kim Ki-duk wanted to make a film that helped spectators to understand what Korea is going through, as a country divided in two, enduring ongoing antagonism between North and South Korea. The director believes that only through knowledge and understanding can real reconciliation be achieved, and he strived to contribute towards that end with this film.

The main character is Private Kang (Dong-Kun Jang), a soldier from the Coast Guard Platoon that accidentally shoots a civilian, believing he is a spy. That event changes his life, and that of those around him, showing us how dangerous and far-reaching an act of violence can be.

Kim Ki-duk tried to juxtapose the natural beauty of Korea with the ugliness of war, and I think that he succeeded quite well. ""The Coast Guard"" is a film about tragedy, fear and despair, and as such is not the kind of movie most people are likely to enjoy. All the same, I believe that it is worth watching, and that is the reason why I give it 3 stars.

8069345,5,B0009X75HO,"(the one star review isn't even worth addressing any further than this: haha.)

what we have here is a breath taking look at one man's desire for respect, and the subsequent losing of his mind.

Ki-Duk Kim knows how to tell a story, no more needs to be said in that respect, and especially if said story is to be laced in melancholy and a slight feeling of bleakness.

it's not necessarily a claustrophobic film, but one does feel almost trapped on the beach where the vast majority of the film takes place.

as with any other Ki-Duk film everything is absolutely marvelous.  from the acting, to the development, the pacing, and the imagery, it is all the mark of a master film maker who fully understands his craft.

the final image in the film left me utterly speechless.",1140566400,10,773,4.525179856115108
8069346,1,B0009X75HO,"The other reviewer must be related to this director.

This is ONE of the worst movies I've seen, though right now I can't think of one that ranks below it.

I was just about to shut if off at one point but made myself stick with it because there wasn't anything on TV.

The acting was laugh out loud bad, the business about the shooter going insane went on and on and on. Yeah, beat the viewers over the head since they are too stupid to get it that he's traumatized.

Several scenes started or ended without explnation. Scenes of, say, a card game, a game of catch with a soccer ball, and others - were supposed to be on different days but were clearly all shot the same day with actors wearing the same clothes, positioned the same and with props in the same place.

I could go on but why bother.

The story concept was a good one and needs to be told, but this was an embarassing attempt and casts a terrible light on Korean cinema.",1127001600,6,935,4.195530726256983
8069347,5,B0009X75HO,"Ki-duk Kim is in high form criticizing a small aspect of the South Korean society, the Coast Guard, and through a surrealistic approach he throws out everything on the table at once.  Nothing is left untouched or too sacred not to be expressed in this film, as he brings the disturbing reality of the tension between the Coast Guard and the civil population in nearby village.  Yet, Ki-duk Kim succeeds in turning it into a bizarre analogy of how the Koreans dealt and deal with national divides where the people are without ability to voice their desires on how to form a nation of their own and lack the ability to listen to one another.  All of this is in the backdrop of real events that have taken place on the beaches of South Korea.

The Korean division illustrates the aftermath of the Cold War that led to the Korean war, a proxy war, which cost more than a total of four million dead in both civilians and military personnel from Korea, China, US, and other countries representing the United Nations.  At the end of the war the boarder between North and South Korea was closed at the 38th Parallel and the coastline dressed with barbwire and bunkers to keep possible North Korean infiltrators and spies away.  Nonetheless, North Korea attempted several times to enter South Korea through the coastline and 20 times they were either captured or killed.  Thus, the South Korean Coast Guard is in constant alert for possible foreign intruders and ready to shoot anyone who approaches the coastlines after sunset in order to protect South Korea.

Ki-duk Kim opens with men in green pajama uniforms running, rolling, and performing headstands in the tide mud while awaiting further orders from the drill sergeants.  This imagery provides an notion of how well they are trained to serve their country and to protect the coastline.  One of the recruits, 1st Private Kang Sang-byeong (Dong-Kun Jang), takes his assignment very seriously.  When he is ridiculed by some young locals rage raises within him when they make fun of what he holds in high respect.  Kang even dares them to come to the coastline after dusk so he can shoot them.

Coincidently, two of the young locals that Kang threatened happen to sneak into the beach for a lovers rendezvous when he notices something moving and shoots.  He kills the young man while the young woman, Mi-yeong (Ji-a Park), enters a frantic state of mind after having witnessed the death of her boyfriend.  The consequences display a traumatized Kang who finds himself shunned by both the civilians and his military unit.  It leaves him wandering in a no mans land between the civil population and the military.  This could be interpreted as symbol for the the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea.  Kang drifts further and further away from reality while trying find something to grab on to that means something to him.  Meanwhile, Mi-yeong's post-traumatic stress reaches the heights of psychosis, as she begin to slowly mutilate her own persona in several ways.  Maybe, Ki-duk Kim intended this to be an analogy for Korea and the bloody war between fellow Koreans that eventually divided the nation in North and South.

Coast Guard has much in common with Ki-duk Kim's other films such as Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring (2003), The Isle (2000), and 3-Iron in regards to how he uses visual symbolism.  It is easy to become absorbed in this film, as if viewing an action or drama.  But underneath the surface the film is drenched in visual analogies that need to be decoded.  For example, the scene where Mi-yeong hacks living fish with a cleaver could suggest her hatred for the military, as the fish have the symbol for prowess and fortitude, common characteristics for military people.  Another theme common in his film is the use of water, which has symbolic links with life and birth.  Perhaps the beginning could indicate some symbolic value to Kang and the other soldiers birth as Coast Guards when they struggle in the mud from the tide like fish splashing about.  The entire film plunges into symbolism that can easily be missed if attention is not directed to the screen.

Altogether, Ki-duk Kim directs another remarkable film, which delivers disharmony through a bloody accident at the South Korean seaside.  Conscious attention must be directed to his intentional symbolism, which elevates his film far above an average cinematic event.  The camerawork is intriguing, but what truly makes this film special is how he frames each scene.  It is clear that Ki-duk Kim has everything under control, as he lets the audience experience his inspiring tale that travels the border of insanity and sanity while symbolically dealing with the Korean past, present, and future.",1120089600,20,4747,4.888888888888889
