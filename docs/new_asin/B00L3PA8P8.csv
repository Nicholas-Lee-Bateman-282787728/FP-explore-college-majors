6464126,5,B00L3PA8P8,"Finally, after what feels like half my life, because it has been half my life, Comedy Central, an ironically named network, has seen fit to release season 3 of UCB. We live in 2014 and by the time I get to relive my first college love I'm virtually middle aged. Thanks, CC.",1405987200,9,273,4.269230769230769
6464127,5,B00L3PA8P8,"THE SECRET IS BEHIND THE BUTTERSCOTCH WATERFALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL

Best sketch comedy show ever. I don't know why it took...15 years to release this final season, but I'm glad they did!",1405468800,5,194,5.689655172413793
6464128,5,B00L3PA8P8,"One of the best sketch comedies ever made. I grew up knocking back supercool and watching this show, it helped me face my addiction to supercool and Ive seen the light that chaos brings. So happy to see that it is finally released and can watch it again!",1404259200,8,254,4.3125
6464129,5,B00L3PA8P8,"I remember watching,loving and laughing UpRight Citizens Brigade way back in the late `90s. Besides The Kids in the Hall,UCB played a huge part in my comedic development while I was growing up.

When I saw Season 1 and Season 2 for sale on DVD (around 2006 or so)I snatched them right away. It was great to watch all the episodes again and share them with friends that missed it the first time around.
Then I waited.for Season 3 to be released on DVD.
And waited..........
And waited........
And waited........
Needless to say,I`m stoked to be able to buy Season 3 in 2014!
Better late than never!",1404259200,11,597,4.579439252336448
6464130,5,B00L3PA8P8,I haven't laughed since the show went off the air.  What a sad last 14 years it has been.  Fatties have an extra bone in their stomach.  And under no circumstances should you ever touch the gun.  Check under the butterscotch waterfall!!!,1403827200,25,237,4.571428571428571

6464150,5,B00L3PA8P8,"The show speaks for itself, so there's no need to waste time doing so. This simply put put is the altogether best show or at least in the all time best 2. I've missed this show & there's originals, deleted scenes, & much more. The only thing that sucks is the fact the 3rd season costs 3x more than 1 or 2.",1468368000,,306,3.9516129032258065

6464153,5,B00L3PA8P8,"100% amazing.  When I got the first 2, I thought, 'hmmm... where's this or that...?' and here they are.  Every season is classic in its own right.",1449100800,,146,4.37037037037037

I ordered this product several times. Each time I received a new copy, the second disc had no information. I just want to complete my collection!",1439251200,,164,4.5
6464156,1,B00L3PA8P8,I love this show and have ordered the DVD's twice now.  I am debating on trying a 3rd time or giving up all together.  Disc one plays fine but Disc 2 hasn't worked both times I have ordered.,1436313600,2,190,3.973684210526316

6464169,3,B00L3PA8P8,"Don't get me wrong, the series itself is amazing, 5 stars. Killer episodes, best in the series. Great to finally see this on DVD...however the transfer is pretty bad. Feels like they just put the transfers downloaded off Morpheus  and said ""hey here's a DVD fulfilling our obligation to release every season"".
Really would have been awesome if Comedy Central put some effort into this, but I guess we should be happy this made it out at all.",1425427200,5,441,4.653846153846154
6464170,5,B00L3PA8P8,"Thunderball alone makes this volume worthwhile.  Great, off-kilter humor.  The UCB are just so awesome!",1422576000,,103,5.8
6464171,5,B00L3PA8P8,Every bit as well written and performed as the first two seasons. Well worth the incredibly long wait for it's release.,1420934400,,119,4.714285714285714
6464172,5,B00L3PA8P8,"It's about time.  I've waited a bajillion years for the third and final chapter of the orgasmic UCB to be released.  Now I can buy beer and drive a car 'cause I'm a HUMAN with exceptional log rolling skills.  This show was ahead of its time and was influential to future writers and show makers.  Heck, even The Simpsons plagiarized the dolphin episode.

This is not fart jokes and easy comedy.  It pushed and criss-crossed story lines and ideas along episodes and seasons but each episode stands on its own.  The characters are absurd in their relatability.

The discs are burned to order on DVD+Rs but they both played and are of good quality. Well worth the money to complete the series.",1419724800,,690,4.598360655737705

6464174,5,B00L3PA8P8,Fast shipping. Very happy.,1417996800,,26,5.75
6464175,5,B00L3PA8P8,"Finally released after the better part of two decades waiting! I don't understand why Comedy Central took so long. It doesn't make any sense to me. Even though it wasn't hugely popular when it was being aired, the show over time slowly became a huge cult hit. Now, anyone who is seriously into improv at least respects these guys. There's also a thriving improv performance community revolving around the UCB Theater in New York and in LA. Every single one of the episodes is a classic! Even after all this time, all the characters, themes, and jokes in the show have never left my head. The show is simply genius.. and I know the word ""genius"" is wildly overused these days. So I try to use that word sparingly, only when something is truly deserving -- which this show definitely is. Long live the UCB!",1415750400,,804,4.551724137931035
6464176,5,B00L3PA8P8,Finally!!!  And fortunately both of my discs worked fine.,1415664000,,57,5.333333333333333

6464200,5,B00L3PA8P8,"I was very happy when this was finally announced. UCB's show was great and it had been years since I'd seen these sketches. If you're a comedy nerd like me, check out the audio commentaries, they are worth it!",1411776000,3,209,4.384615384615385

6464204,5,B00L3PA8P8,"We've waited for years for this; many of us signed petitions.  Comedy Central even told us they'd release this on DVD years ago after one petition got enough sigs... Well, MOD is less ideal than a properly pressed DVD, but I'll accept it as close enough.  And the Amazon page doesn't mention it anywhere, but yes, there ARE extras included on this set (including commentaries, pranks and additional sketches). So this really is pretty much what we've been waiting all these years for.
And now that Comedy Central is dipping into MOD, I wonder if we'll see any of their other old shows that previously looked like they'd never see a release of.",1408924800,5,643,4.68141592920354
6464205,5,B00L3PA8P8,Good to see this finally released.  One of the best sketch comedy troups of all time.  Took years but worth the wait!,1408838400,,117,4.2727272727272725
6464206,5,B00L3PA8P8,"The ONLY complaint would be the video quality. The DVDs are burned on-demand by Amazon so they're not the best quality. However, I'll take what I can get. All the episodes and special features are there.  It's taken years and years and finally the third season is out. This is one of the most underrated shows out there and it's great to get to watch them whenever I want.",1408406400,6,372,4.391304347826087
6464207,4,B00L3PA8P8,"Groundbreaking, subversive comedy from the dawn of the millennium! Fans have been waiting for this for many years.

The DVDs are printed by Amazon services at-need, but the picture quality and production value are as good as the previous seasons. However I did encounter one or two spots where I had trouble with playback on my Xbox 360 which may have been due to the disc. I tried it in a different DVD player and it worked without issue.",1408320000,2,439,4.556962025316456

HOWEVER, I have a complaint!  The packaging is CRAP!  No insert, no list of episodes -- NOTHING!  You know what would have been better than nothing?  ANYTHING!  Still, the material is five-star, and they may have improved the packaging since I bought mine in May, 2015.",1507507200,,326,4.551724137931035

8663615,4,B00L3PA8P8,"Wish it wasn't DVD-R on demand, but at least it's finally available.",1491436800,,68,4.75
8663616,3,B00L3PA8P8,"This is the best season of an amazing sketch show. Like some of UCB's live long form improv shows the characters from the individual sketches all collide at the end of the episode. It's a sketch with momentum that builds toward a satisfying conclusion. The four payers are great at creating characters and it's really fun to see all the different types they play across a single episode.

The DVD it's self is not functional. Several episodes will not play when you select them individually. I can only view them if I select ""Play All"" and skip ahead. Menus freeze forcing me to restart my DVD player. I read reviews that seasons 2 and 3 were cheaply made. I assumed that meant the menus were slapped together but the company selling a dvd that doesn't work properly.

This incredible comedy team deserves to have their work archived properly. The paying customers who want to own copies of the show deserve a quality product.

Again, this season is a master work. I think everyone who is a comedy nerd should own all 3. I just wish he manufacturer put more effort in or these episodes were re-released.",1487980800,2,1103,4.61734693877551
8663617,5,B00L3PA8P8,"I had forgotten how funny this season was... probably because it was unavailable the longest! Such a great troupe - it's a shame they never got a real big-studio chance to branch into features like Python of KITH. Distinct, idiosyncratic comedy from four performers with great range. Thunderball! Werewolf Sex! Cake-a-Walk-as! It's all here! There is not a full-episode misfire in the bunch. Indeed, I can't think of any bits that were outright D.O.A. Great sketch comedy. Period.",1487376000,,480,5.166666666666667
8663618,5,B00L3PA8P8,I absolutely love this show! I've owned the first two seasons for years but only had a handful of first run season 3 episodes recorded on VHS. Amazon is the only place I've been able to find this. Quality on both discs was excellent! If you've never watched this show I cannot recommend it highly enough!,1478822400,,304,4.446428571428571
8663619,4,B00L3PA8P8,Okay so im gonna say this if this is actually matt besser im okay with paying the extra money but you can get the dvd on the ucb webstore cheaper...also if you love UCB as much as me you have been waiting years for this dvd series..i wish there was a live q&a at the ucb theater like in the first 2 seasons and a paper case instead of the regular plastic case but im just happy it was released but ya not sure bout the seller but dude if it is matt ..sign one or draw a weiner on it or something,1476403200,,495,3.8155339805825244
