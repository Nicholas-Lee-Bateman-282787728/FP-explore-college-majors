8205166,4,B000SE8MSK,I was pleased to receive the dvd in the promised time. But unfortunately the dvd did neither work in my dvd player nor in the ones of my aquaintances- only bits of the picture where possible to watch. sound only worked while menue appeared and then some b/w footage without sound was possible to monitor. no bill was in the package and no adress where to send a complaint. So I sent my complaint mail to the website where one can order the DVD directly and got a friendly answer and the option to get a new DVD at their cost.,1323561600,3,525,4.207920792079208
8205167,5,B000SE8MSK,"My mother told me stories of when she was interned in a Japanese Internment camp. i could not picture what it was like until i saw your pictures. She told me people were starving. she dreamed of eating dry toast. She said they would pick the worms out of their rice in the beginning later they didn't. She was 19 years old. she fell in love in camp, she made friends with the cook who would send her oranges. She worked in the garden and picked and ate tomatoes. She told of mosquito nets over her bed. Her sister's two children died in a similar camp. Lack of food and medicine.
My mother does not remember this as a terrible time but a story that must be told. She survived and lived to be 86 years old with 2 children and nine grandchildren and ten greatgrandchildren. Thank you.",1216339200,13,782,4.29054054054054
