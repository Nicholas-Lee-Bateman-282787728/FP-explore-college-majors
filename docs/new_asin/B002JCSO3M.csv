8532097,5,B002JCSO3M,"Larry David is a guy we want to know more about.  Is he the grouchy, selfish, anti-social character we meet on ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" or a wealthy, keep-to-himself LA type?  How did this person create the memorable Seinfeld characters as well as the cleverly sketched ones on his current show?  He appears in public infrequently, so it was fun to see the interview with Yankee broadcaster Michael Kaye, a personable man with a pleasantly familiar voice and style, especially for Yankee fans.  We saw Larry David as a down-to-earth guy who was accessible, open, and entertaining.  He shared information about his background -- the large Jewish family that helped form his sense of humor and view of life.  He told of his efforts in creating his successful TV shows and came across as a friendly, humble person.  Michael Kaye's conversational style and a few questions from the small audience members added up to a revealing glimpse of Larry David.",1311897600,7,946,4.911949685534591
