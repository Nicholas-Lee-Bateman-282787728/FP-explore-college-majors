7859782,5,6304038798,"I own and LOVE this set . Folks are always going on about ""who was/is the best Bond"" and so forth . Seems pretty subjective to me . I like ALL the actors who've portrayed James Bond for various reasons . When it comes to Roger Moore , he was my favorite fun , silly and outrageous Bond . Fun being the optimal word . Six of his seven appearances are here . Tim Dalton's two outings as well . I prefer his (Dalton's) second go round . The set I have is ALL widescreen with only one picture being other than 2.35:1 in aspect ratio . Closed captions and a very nifty case make this a grand collection .",1523059200,,599,4.0

7859784,5,6304038798,"This is the second in a set of the original Bond films released in their correct release-date order. The set primarily includes Roger Moore as James Bond in his 7 movies, and Timothy Dalton in his first Bond appearance. Videos in the set are typically in letterbox format, vhs HiFi, and 6 of the 8 are in Dolby Surround Stereo. Movies include LIVE AND LET DIE (1973), THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN (1974), THE SPY WHO LOVED ME (1977), MOONRAKER (1979), FOR YOUR EYES ONLY (1981),OCTOPUSSY (1983), A VIEW TO A KILL (1985) and THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS (1987). Roger Moore fans will find this set to be a welcome addition to their Bond video library, especially since the set is presented in Chronological order following Volume 1 (007 Gift Set which encompasses Sean Connery's work).",1083542400,2,775,4.705882352941177
