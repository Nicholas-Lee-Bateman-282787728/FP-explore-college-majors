8685412,5,B00OYT4DXS,"I saw the exhibition at the Tate in London.  Prior to that I had visited the Matisse Museum in Cimiez in Nice and the chapel in Vence.  When I went to see the presentation of this film in my local movie theater, I wondered if I would find it worthwhile.  I think the fact that I did enjoy it is a tribute to the filmakers (and to the power of Matisse of course).  There is something about the way the camera adds focus that presents the work in a different dimension.  The other benefit of viewing the dvd is that you are relieved of the chatter and crowding that accompanies any major exhibition these days.  It is just you and the artist and the story that the filmaker choses to tell.",1442793600,2,687,4.206106870229007
8685413,4,B00OYT4DXS,"Matisse:The Cut-outs
Cineworld screened on 3-06-14 for 1.5 hours live at local cinema from the Tate. Intro to Matisses early life. Excerpts of Matisse voiceover by Simon Russell Beale. Presenter Francine Stock and Tate Director Nicholas Serota converse about Matisse in front of The Snail (the premier work owned by the Tate since 1962) and opposite wall, Memories of Oceania. I noticed at times throughout the Live programme talking heads were in front of major works, talking about them, which was regrettable.

We move through all the galleries (there are about 15 rooms) fairly quickly, glancing at 1 or 2 works in each room, without closing in or focussing. This is followed by showing them mounting the exhibition, how they set up or set out the works.

Things I remember: Howard Jacobson talking to Francine Stock. It was a literary mans appraisal of The Parakeet and The Mermaid, enthused with enthusiasm. Then this was followed by a more expert appraisal, a full view.

There was a dance interlude by a leading ballerina, who attempted to simulate in different colours and movements, the principle of how dance animates some of his works, both paintings and cut-outs.

There was a section devoted to his set of early cut-outs, Jazz, for a book, based upon the principle of jazz music. Courtney Pine showed how he was inspired to write a piece of jazz for the show, with pictures from the book being shown of Horses, Riders, clowns & acrobats.

Discussion of The Large Composition with Masks. How it was originally going to have as two side panels, The Snail and Memories of Oceania. We have discussion with Nick Serota and a gallery supervisor about the room of the Blue Nudes, with some sculptures of nudes. How he took months to cut out his 1st Blue Nude, then did the other 3 more quickly. How a lifetime experience of painting nudes had gone into this.

There are interviews with 1 of his female assistants. Another, the Ice Princess or The Bolshevik, stays with him until his death. There are filmed excerpts of him directing them or cutting out coloured fronds with large scissors quickly. His technique of cutting into colour, drawing with colour, pinning the cut-outs to the wall.

The chapel at Vence project is covered, how it evolved and was displayed, how it generated more cut-outs later. There is a room where similar pictures are displayed. This is done through a documentary film feature.

There is an interesting interview with his grand-daughter who appraises his methods of work, she stands in front of a work, Zulma, form done in different colours. Theres also an interview with Francois Gilot, Picassos mistress and artist about visiting the wheelchair radical, who had evolved a new art form, giving a 2nd life. This was when they all lived in the south of France.

My favourite cut-out is The Snail, it has the majesty,contructive rightness of a painting with beautiful, sometimes torn blocks of colour, in superb harmony. This seemed the summation of the whole cut-out process and its best advertisement. I would say you have to be a lover of
Matisse, who ruled modern art with Picasso after the turn of the 20th century and matched him in ability ,invention and colour. For those who
couldn't get to London, this is the next best thing. These exhibitions are like comets that come round once every 30 or 40 years or they may
never come again. This is the next best substitute and it was a 15 minute walk from my house to see it.",1430697600,4,3462,4.785594639865996
