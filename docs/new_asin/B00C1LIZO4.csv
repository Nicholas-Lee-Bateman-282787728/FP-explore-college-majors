5685338,5,B00C1LIZO4,"I have already written a review for this and do not know why it is here again, as I purchased only one copy.  A great Disney Jr movie for preschoolers.  Handy Manny and his tool friends and other friends are watching a movie.  But the projector breaks down.  Handy Manny and the tools have to fix it.  Some of the tools put on a show during the repair time.  They put on a fun show, full of laughter.  Finally everyone gets to see the movie, as the projector is fixed.",1377648000,,468,4.133333333333334
