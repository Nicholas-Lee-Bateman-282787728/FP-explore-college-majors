8525578,1,B0085F95ZS,I bought this thinking it would enhance some of training material.  Wrong...  you will do much better to lecture on your own then to watch someone else stand in front of a curtain and mono talk.,1312156800,,194,4.361111111111111
8525579,1,B0085F95ZS,I ordered this training DVD to use at my fire department for our annual training. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD IF YOU ARE PRESENTING IT IN FRONT OF ANYONE! What I bought was a $100 burnt copy. It plays the first 2 topics then freezes up when the others are played. BUYER BEWARE!!!,1301788800,2,271,4.132075471698113
