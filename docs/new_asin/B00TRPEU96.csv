8702961,5,B00TRPEU96,"Superb performances by two iconic pianists who have known each other from when they were child prodigies in Buenos Aires.  Martin Kettle's notes in the booklet are fascinating and cover some of the Argerich-Barenboim relationship since 1948 in Buenos Aires. I liked this CD so much that I bought the Blu-Ray DVD on the recommendation of I. Giles. The quality of the audio on the CD is not that good. The portions of the Stravinsky are horrible on the CD, but come thru beautifully on the Blu-Ray. I wish I could return the CD - interesting historically, but weak sound.

This Blu-Ray is a MUST for any admirer of either Argerich or Barenboim. It is well worth the extra money.",1452297600,,676,4.625

8702963,5,B00TRPEU96,"This blu-ray disc brings together two universally popular pianists who have known each other since they were both children in Buenos Aires in Argentina as 7 and 8 year olds. Curiously they never played music together at that time though and that situation has remained almost entirely the case until this particular concert in 2014. ('It was not until the 1980's, when Barenboim was music director of the Orchestra de Paris, that Argerich did a series of dates' with Barenboim as conductor. 'It was also in Paris, during roughly the same period, that Barenboim and Argerich finally gave a four handed recital together for the first time.'  - sleeve note quotes). Not surprisingly the 2014 event on this new disc, only their second as a piano duo, was a sell-out and the enthusiasm of the audience at the end cannot be missed.

The Schubert Variations had previously been played by the pair in the earlier recital in Paris and the Mozart sonata was previously known to Argerich who had a high regard for Barenboim's Mozart playing. These two items therefore were known quantities to both pianists as a duo and are given performances of subtlety and precision at this concert which clearly reflect their ease with the repertoire and with each other as musicians and friends.

The surprise item was the arrangement for 4 hands at 2 pianos that Stravinsky had written just prior to the first orchestral performances of the Rite of Spring. He had played it with Debussy which probably would have been a memorable occasion had there been an audience. On this occasion the temptation of the piece was a clincher for both Barenboim and Argerich even though Argerich had to learn the piece specially having never played it before. If anyone has doubts about the resultant accuracy the following quote from Barenboim should suffice to quell and such fears: `  .... This was the first time Martha had played it. And she made absolutely no mistakes at all. I was flabbergasted'

The experience of listening to the work played on just two pianos having only heard it before in the full orchestral dress was quite a remarkable experience. There were absolutely no compromises made as regards interpretation and tempi etc. so a direct comparison becomes valid.

What is surprising is that one does not so much miss the wealth of so much orchestral detail as noticing so much more constructional detail achieved with increased clarity through reduction. This is in much the same way as it is possible for monochrome imagery to have more impact than colour because the structure of the imagery becomes more important and therefore can have more impact. Obviously the reverse is also true and one misses the full orchestral effects in terms of orchestral colour where piano textures simply do not have the colour range. The effect is much the same as that experienced when comparing the two versions of Rachmaninov's Symphonic Dances when played by expert musicians.

Reducing the comparisons to a basic level it would be fair to say that the piano version as here lays bare the structure of the work with increased clarity while the orchestral version extends the textural nature of the work beyond the capability of two pianos.

There is a strong case therefore for collectors to have both versions from which they will get a greater understanding of Stravinsky's achievement which becomes increasingly extraordinary as this extraordinary performance and occasion progresses.

The sleeve notes focus mainly on the two pianists in a biographical way rather than on the music. There are no extras on the disc so opportunities may have been missed there in terms of presentation. However, on the plus side, the sound is excellent though and is presented in 24/48 DTS 5.1 and stereo and the camera work is of the same quality and the imaging is equally excellent.

Musically and technically therefore, this is a premium product in every way and purchasers should find this to be a very satisfying investment. In particular the Stravinsky arrangement is likely to far surpass casual interest and instead provide means for greater understanding and appreciation of a recognised 20th century masterpiece.

In summary, this offers fine Mozart and Schubert which pale against revelatory performances of the Stravinsky making this a very desirable disc.",1429488000,12,4327,5.004172461752434
