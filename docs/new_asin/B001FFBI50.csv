8301992,4,B001FFBI50,pretty good story not a far off movie suspenseful good ending. I like these movies without having the hot shot rich actors in them the big time actors are way overpaid and think they are GODS,1396396800,,191,4.333333333333333
8301993,1,B001FFBI50,"Michael Pare's acting in this movie is the worst I've ever seen on the screen. Every one of his lines sounds like he's auditioning for community theater.
Stunningly bad. It must have been HELL for the actors who did scenes with him.... Yeeeesh.",1372809600,,244,4.6976744186046515
8301994,1,B001FFBI50,"This must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  It almost reminded me of a bad soap opera type theme as maybe a few other films I have seen have.  Seemed like I was watching the clock just to see when it was going to end.  If you like drama, soap opera type movies then think you could enjoy it but otherwise if you skip it don't think you will be missing much.

8301995,3,B001FFBI50,"I was bored flipping through the channels and stumbled upon this movie.  Throughout the movie it was a typical B movie, but what the heck I didn't have anything else to do.  So the acting wasn't great the story line was strange and his partner was a freak.  Didn't make much sense until the end, I am usually pretty good at guessing endings.  This gets my wife upset when we watch a movie and 30 minutes into it I know who done it per say.  This movie totally surprised me and the ending was to me absolutely amazing if you can make it that far.

So if you have time to kill and want to watch a B movie with a great ending this is for you.  Some of the people that gave this a bad review, I think they forgot it is a B movie.  I mean seriously were not talking ""Heat"" here so just remember it is what it is with what I thought to be a great ending that was totally unexpected.",1259107200,7,876,3.9657142857142857
8301996,2,B001FFBI50,"Looks like  a low budget, direct to dvd movie, this one. The 'stars' are not too well known and the script, well, let's just say it leaves a bit to be desired. At least the voice-over narration by the main character keeps us apprised of what's going on, sort of, but the constant screen shot time signatures are a bit pretentious. At least the whole thing isn't too long, but there's a bit too much gratuitous violence. And some of the acting is amateurish at best.",1250985600,2,465,4.406976744186046
8301997,4,B001FFBI50,"I actually liked this movie a lot mostly because after getting to the end, I was SO surprised by it that I went form its just OK to way cool. Once you know the end, watching it again, changes how you ""see"" the actors responses.
Pare` is really good in it once you understand his actions which are kind of bland through most of the movie until the final scenes where he comes on strong. Russell is great with her script. Definitely worth a bit of change.",1235433600,6,453,4.218390804597701
8301998,2,B001FFBI50,"I bought this movie mainly because of the cast for this film--Thersa Russell, Steve Bauer, and Michael Pare--top actors of B movies. Boy, was I disappointed.  Boring plot that jumps over the place and hard to follow.  Not an interesting film at all --avoid this one!!!",1234310400,5,268,4.804347826086956
8301999,5,B001FFBI50,"If you are a true fan of Michael Pare'
 I reccomend this film. In My opinion its one of his best. Superb acting job as always but such a excellant storyline.",1233446400,,157,4.064516129032258
