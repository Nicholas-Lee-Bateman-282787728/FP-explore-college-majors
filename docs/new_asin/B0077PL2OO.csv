5062285,3,B0077PL2OO,History class all over again.  It is not remotely appealing to watch - and I do enjoy documentaries.  It has a lot of info but not much else.,1360281600,,141,4.0
5062286,5,B0077PL2OO,"This is the consummate compendium of the American Civil War. It is very complete with period photographs,maps,and reenactments of the major battles- historically correct with casts of thousands.
