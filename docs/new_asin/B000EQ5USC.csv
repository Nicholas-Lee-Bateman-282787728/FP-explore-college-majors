8112825,5,B000EQ5USC,"I had not stumbled into this drama until later. I Started off with Creating Destiny which is a good one I think. I loved Eugene in it and I have recently have found about  Ji Sung because of Royal family. Great actors these two they managed to capture me in the story, the characters themselves. I read it was originally only going to be 16 and they extended it to 20. I can see why. Great Drama Recommend it to everyone. I've watched other Dramas but this one has a special place for me:)",1300924800,,489,4.202127659574468

8112829,3,B000EQ5USC,I love the music on the korean dramas and this one is no exception. Thank goodness for the music other wise alot of these drams would not be rated so high. The storyline was good but at the end it seemed as if the director did not know how to end the story and just throw everything in not giving closure to all of the characters.,1183507200,2,330,4.015151515151516

8112831,4,B000EQ5USC,"Korean Dramas are known to be really emotional and cliched with the typical girl dying in the end due to some disease or accident. However, this movie stands out from those others and leaves you feeling like you've experienced a deep and fated love. Eun-Soo, the female protagonist, runs a sort of bed and breakfast with her father in a rural village. While driving home from the hospital, they happen upon a man who's been stabbed and takes him to the hospital. He's lost his memory, and with no one to care for him, Eun-Soo and her dad take him home with them. Naming him Jan-Ho, they have him help out around the B&B and Eun-Soo and Jan-Ho eventually fall in love.

Jan-Ho's past catches up with him when someone from his former life sees him at the B&B and arranges for him to get kidnapped and killed. Jan-Ho escapes, but in the process gets hit by a car and loses his memory of the time he spent with Soo-Jin. Thinking that he's abandoned her, Eun-Soo decides to get on with her life and moves to the city. While at her friend's workplace, she spots a man who looks like Jan-Ho. Turns out Jan-Ho's real name is Hyun Woo, and he's the son of the man who heads the big conglomerate in which her friend works!

This movie has many instances in which you smile, cry, and cheer for our heroine and applaud Jan-Ho's devotion to Eun-Soo. Jan-Ho just looks more and more handsome as his character changes and develops into this serious and passionate man who openly expresses his love for Eun-Soo. Eun-Soo starts out as a sassy, headstrong, and slightly selfish girl and turns into a mature, gentle, and kinder woman. There are several parts of this movie that I love to watch again and again because the portrayal of the anguish of love is so engrossing. Plus, there's a happy ending, and I love my ""happily ever afters.""",1155686400,22,1820,4.495468277945619
