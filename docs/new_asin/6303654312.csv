695389,4,6303654312,"Based on stories from the deliciously depraved E.C. horror comics (TALES FROM THE CRYPT, VAULT OF HORROR, HAUNT OF FEAR) of the 1950s, TALES FROM THE CRYPT was a TV horror anthology that, like most TV anthologies, had a lot of both hits and misses.  Some of the stories really stank, but when a story was a hit, it was usually dead on (excuse the pun).  This DVD represents three episodes that HBO execs apparently consider hits, probably because they were all directed by the renowned and Oscar-winning (1994's FORREST GUMP) Robert Zemeckis.  And though CRYPT fans would like to see more episodes made available on DVD, the execs made pretty good selections with this lot.
The first story, ""And All Through the House,"" is definitely the scariest of the three.  It's about a disgruntled wife who murders her husband on Christmas Eve, only to have a madman dressed in Santa garb show up to deliver her just deserts.  It is a particulary frightening morality play not only because it warns that ""what goes around, comes around""; it also makes a multi-faceted statement about innocence and youth, as it is the murderous woman's little daughter who ultimately lets ""Santa"" into the house.  Larry Drake delivers a delectably deranged performance as the insane Saint Nick.  (This has proven to be one of the most enduring stories from the original E.C. Comics series, as it was also previously dramatized in 1972 as one portion of an excellent five-part British flick entitled TALES FROM THE CRYPT.  In that version, Joan Collins--DYNASTY's Alexis Carrington Colby--played the part of the homicidal wife.)
In the second story, ""Yellow,"" Kirk Douglas is a stone-hearted, by-the-book WWI General and, his son, Eric Douglas, is a craven Lieutenant under the General's command.  Embarrassed by his ""yellow"" progeny, the General engages his son in an insidious course of action that will save the young man's reputation as well as allow the General himself to save face.  Although the ending is easily predictable, the acting is top-notch and the depiction of WWI is fairly gruesome (for TV, anyway), and it all adds up to an engaging and suspenseful drama.  This is definitely the strongest episode of the trio, though not as scary as the first.
The last of the three offerings, ""You, Murderer,"" is also the weakest.  It covers the last day in the life of a business exec who, altered via plastic surgery to hide from a dark past, is blackmailed and then offed by his cuckolding wife and her lover. Though the plot is a bit cliche and its ending predictable, the episode does, nonetheless, have a few interesting aspects: one, the story is told via flashbacks from the point of view of the already-dead exec; two, &aacute; la plastic surgery, the exec is the spitting image of Humphrey Bogart; and three, great performances are delivered by Isabella Rossellini (daughter of the real-life Bogart's CASABLANCA costar Ingrid Bergman) and character actor John Lithgow.  The episode's biggest flaw is the special effects, which are primarily computerized insertions of Bogart film-clips &aacute; la FORREST GUMP.  Unlike in GUMP, the effects come across as embarrasingly cheesy, and the manner in which they are utilized is very awkward to the flow of the narrative.  Still, it's an entertaining entry for CRYPT, just one that is not up to par with the other two on this disc.
One minorly disappointing aspect to the DVD overall is the fact that there are no extras on the disc.  Some HBO or syndication promotional spots or an interview with Zemeckis would've been nice, or maybe even a behind-the-scenes short featuring our gregarious host, The Crypt Keeper. Still, this DVD is well worth the expense, especially for fans of TALES FROM THE CRYPT or fans of the horror genre in general.  At Amazon.com's asking price, the cost is less than $5 per episode, and that's cheaper than the cost-per-episode charged for many TV shows in either VHS or DVD format!",1002585600,20,3941,4.929003021148036

I hope this is just the first in a long running set for this series, but it doesn't look like it.
This DVD contains the three episodes done by  Robert Zemeckis.
And All Through the House"" (1989), remided me of  the 'Tales From The Crypt - Have A Scary Little Christmas' CD I've had for  quite a while.  Basically the same backdrop of the story told on the CD is  here, except for the 'Mother' killing her husband.  Anyhow, that's how it  starts, but what the poor mother does not know is that an escaped lunatic  is on the prowl.
""Yellow"" (1991), A dang good yarn if I do say  so eh kiddies?  Martin Sheen's excellent in this story of a san who cannot  live up to his father's aspects of courageousness.
""You,  Murderer"" (1995), is really wierd.  Stars Humphrey Bogart, Sherilyn  Fenn, and some other famous personalities and basically the tale is in  Bogart's voice.  He is dead (murdered actually) but can still see what is  happing around him, hear everything, and worse feel everything!
Pretty  good set.  Some great stars in these episodes and I really loved the  episode 'Yellow'.
