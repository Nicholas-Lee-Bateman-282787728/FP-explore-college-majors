8016124,2,B0001O3YQW,There isn't much to go for it in this movie except for some OK acting by Yo Bo.  Don't really care for it.,1446076800,,106,3.608695652173913
8016125,4,B0001O3YQW,"This movie was very interesting to watch, I was really intrigued by the fact that it was the first movie done with openly gay actors. It was very short and sweet for me. I wouldn't say it had a blockbuster budget but they used their resources well, portraying the life and experiences of gay Chinese in a way that seemed realistic.  The main character was lovable and the plot seemed very slow at first but sped up rather quickly. I don't remember if this film had a climax but I genuinely enjoyed it.",1374451200,,501,4.387096774193548
8016126,4,B0001O3YQW,"This film gives you a inside look at like in a different country, especially, gay life.  It makes you think and is not difficult to follow.",1353974400,,139,4.346153846153846
8016127,2,B0001O3YQW,"This movie moves incredibly slow.  For example, instead of showing one second of pool and then going into dialogue between the pool players, they show a whole game of pool with no dialogue besides ""Good move!""  At one point, they film the outside of a bathroom for an entire minute:  no dialogue, no actors, nothing.  The thing to which Western gay male and lesbian viewers may relate is the heterosexism and compulsory heterosexuality.  Straight characters frequently ask the gay main character if he has a girlfriend without once thinking that maybe he doesn't want one.  They try to matchmake him with women, as if all men are attracted to women.  I just cannot imagine anybody besides Sinologists enjoying this film.",1122940800,3,720,4.95
