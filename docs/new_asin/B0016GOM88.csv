8262396,4,B0016GOM88,"This was a very good Hindi movie that I rented to watch, and now I'm going to buy it. There are fewer songs and dancing scenes than in typical Bollywood movies and the overall theme was predictable, but there were enough twists and surprises thrown in to make it enjoyable. I haven't seen the main actors in other movies before.

If you like Bollywood romances, you'll like this one!",1482796800,,383,4.550724637681159
8262397,2,B0016GOM88,"I saw part of this movie on a flight to Delhi, so I decided to get the movie and watch the rest. This has to be the most ridiculous plot ever. I gave it two stars because it does contain some chuckles.",1462406400,,201,3.8095238095238093
8262398,5,B0016GOM88,"It's funny even at the age I am I'm learning a lot from these movies.
This one is really good.",1290470400,,94,3.75
8262399,5,B0016GOM88,I like the whole movie because it shows how hard it is to trust someone and share your life with them. All the couples involved learn that a marriage is a shared responsibility between two individuals. I will watch this many more times.,1243987200,2,236,4.511627906976744
