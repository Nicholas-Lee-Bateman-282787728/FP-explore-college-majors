7871279,5,630444950X,"The blurb of this movie is ""No Wings. No Halos. All Actions!"" In short, a beautiful supermodel-turned-gangster double crosses her ruthless partners after the gang steals a precious relic from a Manila museum. Now, an enterprisiong young Interpol agent, with the help of a comical taxi driver, must stop the voscious gang and return the relic to its rightful owners. COMMENT: This is the second movie starring Cynthia Khan I have watched (the first one is ""In the Line of Duty III""). Like Ang Lee, I fell in love with Cynthia Khan immediately. But, there is a difference between Cynthia Khan's appearance in this movie and in the previous movie. In this movie, Cynthia looks more feminine than in the previous movie, even though in terms of fighting standards, they are approximately similar. My guess is because in this movie Cynthia wears long hair. The inclusion of a comical taxi driver is well-thought off. It provides an amusing and pleasant distraction from an ""exciting gunplay and thrilling martial arts action that will knock your socks off!"". I am happy to give this movie 5 star.",1260230400,2,1090,4.897297297297297

Insane plot,but great fun.
especially if your a fan of this type of film.

 Nice print quality Full Screen, only missing a tiny bit of both sides.",1246665600,3,202,4.555555555555555
7871281,2,630444950X,"While the female lead is extremely attractive, the movie as a whole is ugly! The plot, to recover a stolen relic, is so uninteresting & unimportant that I almost fell asleep. The fighting is sparse & the bad editing makes the occasional fight scene a visual disaster. Uneventful, uninteresting & disastrous. I wanted to dip my DVD player into boiling water after running this flick.",1126828800,,382,4.892307692307693
7871282,3,630444950X,"Some exciting action set pieces help weak story of a female Interpol agent who is trying to find a supermodel/thief who is on the run from her own problems.  Padded, with dopey Filipino cab driver sidekicks, but good enough action to recommend.",1029801600,4,244,4.809523809523809
7871283,1,630444950X,I thought this movie was by far the nothing more than an utter bore fest. If you have trouble sleeping try this DVD half way through I guarantee  sleeping will no-longer be your affliction.  Oh and the costumes were so  dated that I thought Muscle shirts were in style again. I hope this helps  in sorting through the really bad Hong Kong Joints. Note: Mad fake action  and poor acting its great comb if you like being ripped off. Learn from my  mistake! PLease!,967680000,4,462,4.440476190476191
