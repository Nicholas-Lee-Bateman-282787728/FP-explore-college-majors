My Mom is a LHOTP fanatic and this is the perfect couple of shows to pop in the DVD player when she wants to see Laura Engalls. Clear pictures, great copy of the show. Would recommend for the fan who doesn't want to buy the $200 complete set. Just a small selection of the shows focused on the children",1362787200,,358,4.128571428571429

8313788,5,B001JV5B9E,"I love Little House on the Prairie, the books and the iconic television series. The series is the epitome of wholesome family entertainment and I'm glad we can enjoy them on DVDs.

This DVD is a sort of compilation of three episodes featuring Laura and the cast of Little House. The episodes are:
Town Party, Country Party - Laura befriends Olga Nordstrom, a shy young girl who was born with a short leg. Nellie Olsen torments Olga, and Laura feels bad for her, but a circumstance arises where Laura is forced to tease Olga because of Nellie's threats. Laura tries to atone for her behavior, and Charles or ""Pa"" steps in to help Olga in a way that is life-changing.
At the End of the Rainbow - Laura and her classmate chance upon 'gold' when they're out fishing, and secretly work in earnest to pile their 'gold'. Laura starts fantasizing of all the ways she is going to spend her riches,ignorant of the true nature of her 'wealth'.
""Be My Friend"" - Laura finds a bottle with a mysterious message and together with Pa makes an astonishing discovery.

There may be only three episodes here, but I felt that this DVD is perfect for entertaining a young girl [perhaps aged 5-10], and I don't have to scan through my old Little House DVDs looking for the episodes. I really don't care for some of the so-called kids entertainment on TV these days. With the exception of a few shows, most appear inane and don't really promote any good values. Little House on the Prairie harks back to more innocent times, and for a few minutes at least, we can all be transported to a more wholesome era.

This DVD runs for about 140 mins, is in full screen format, full color and comes with a bonus mini scrapbook with sticker sheets.",1239840000,11,1715,4.508038585209003
