The prior reviews are describing an American tv musical mini-series of Alice, which was one of my favorites as child, so I was looking forward to watching. (I still remember the songs to this day.) However, the series streaming above is a British version of Alice, which I don't expect to finish. Please correct.",1528934400,,341,4.7
8620684,3,B00G4RDM1M,"There have been may renditions of Alice in Wonderland. Some more true to the story and others that just use the title. Then there is this 1985 miniseries version that uses the structure to display talents or what not of many actors and singers; they had more time so you can see more characters than most productions.

This is miniseries is more of a musical held together by the Alice theme.

I did not know that some of the cast was still alive in 1985. Most were of an earlier era in film.

I was really surprised to see that Martha Raye was in this production. I saw her one in real life in at the foot of Dragon Mountain, Pleiku 1967. Even then I was surprised. She out performed Bob Hope.

8620685,5,B00G4RDM1M,"An interesting 1985 film mini-series - ""Alice In Wonderland"" CBS-TV/Screen Gems co-production with producer Irwin Allen helming the CBS television film two part TV special; the musical feature film features an all star film, television and Broadway cast of performers delivering a cohesive production.  Recommend that the viewer also look at the ""live video taped production"" broadcast by NBC, a 2-hour 1966 television special ""Alice Through The Looking Glass"" (DVD) as an interesting comparison and contrast with the 20 year difference in production staging values; a 1966 simply elaborate staged live studio television version compared with a 1985 grand elaborate filmed epic! .",1512259200,,680,5.601941747572815
8620686,5,B00G4RDM1M,"This is my favorite version of Alice in Wonderland/Through the Looking Glass. I watched it on TV in 1985 and then over and over on VHS. It has great musical numbers, colorful sets and a sassy Alice. I may be biased because I'm a child of the 80's but I highly recommend this version!",1509580800,2,283,4.2592592592592595

This is based on the 19th century story by Lewis Carroll. It begins at a large house. Little Alice helps her mother set the table for tea, then goes outside. When will she grow up? A White Rabbit appears and runs into a cave. Alice follows and falls! She opens doors and enters an empty room. She tastes a bottle and shrinks! Then she eats a cake and grows. Her tears run like rain. Strange creatures follow in the stream. Alice wanders, the White Rabbit asks her to get his fan and gloves; she enters a small house. A bottle makes her grow again! Some cakes are thrown through the window, she changes to her previous size. She sees a caterpillar on a mushroom who is smoking a pipe. Then he disappears! Alice enters a house. Two women act strange.

This world is not a paradise. Alice runs out with the baby, who turns into a pig! She asks the Cheshire Cat for directions home. Then he disappears. Alice finds the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, and a Dormouse. After this she continues her journey. Alice sings to a fawn. She enters a door and finds a garden. The people walk down the stairs, the King and Queen arrive. The Queen is excitable. Can Alice play croquet? The Queen always wins! The Cheshire Cat reappears. Grovel on the gravel says the Queen to the Duchess. Next she finds a Gryphon, then a Mock Turtle. Nothing he says makes sense. There is a dance on the grass. Then the trial begins. The witnesses testify. [Is this funny? Satirical?] Suddenly Alice grows up to free the Knave. Off with her head! Alice runs away, then falls asleep.

When she awakes she is back at home. But she is on the other side of the mirror! She finds the book Jabberwocky and reads it. There is thunder and lightning, and a monster lizard appears in her home! To Be Continued. Then the credits roll to list the characters and the players in this movie. Part Two lists the actors and their characters. The story resumes with that scary monster, who just disappears. The chess pieces are alive! The Owl explains life behind the Looking Glass. Flowers talk to Alice. She meets the Red Queen. How can she get home? She boards a train to travel. When it stops she gets off. She meets Tweedledee and Tweedledum. Next the Walrus and the Carpenter. After she meets the White Queen she turns into a sheep. A giant vulture chases Alice.

Next she meets Humpty Dumpty; they talk. The Jabberwocky appears to chase Alice! She escapes. She meets the White King. The Lion and the Unicorn fight for the crown. Can Alice cut the cake? There is a drumming noise, two knights approach to do battle. The White Knight leads Alice away towards home. She gets a crown and scepter! The Red and White Queens show up and talk to Alice. Alice goes to the house with her name on it. It has a giant hall with a banquet table. The characters encountered earlier show up. But Alice just wants to go home. There is a shocking surprise when she opens a present! Can the White Knight save Alice? Alice passes through the Looking Glass and returns home. Where have you been? She is grown up now and can join the adults for tea. The story ends and the credits roll.

I suspect some of these characters were parodies of people in mid-nineteenth century England; they are not relevant today. I never read these stories as a child and never will as an adult. Is this a movie for children or adults?",1439856000,2,3379,4.434782608695652
