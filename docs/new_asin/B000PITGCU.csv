If you are thinking of buying the King of queens 1-8 don't wait, It's worth every cent.

ABOUT THE SHOW:

Set in the working-class suburb of Queens, New York, the show follows Doug Heffernan (Kevin James), an amiable deliveryman, and his wife, spitfire legal secretary Carrie Heffernan (Leah Remini), as they explore the everyday challenges of love, life, family and marriage.

Doug and Carrie deal with day-to-day domestic realities that reflect our times and enable us to laugh at ourselves. Their love for each other ultimately carries them through each dilemma they face, whether it's Doug's fixation with food or Carrie's obsession with expensive clothing.

Doug and Carrie also have to deal with the third, high-maintenance member of the Heffernan household. Carrie's twice-widowed father, Arthur Spooner (Jerry Stiller), lives in their basement. His constant presence and often-bizarre behavior add to their daily adventures. Doug often finds refuge in the little alone time he has with Carrie, best friend and co-worker, Deacon (Victor Williams), buddy Spence (Patton Oswalt) and his cousin Danny (Gary Valentine).

In a manner that evokes ""The Honeymooners,"" THE KING OF QUEENS finds inspiration in life's everyday situations. Throughout, the series showcases James' incredible physical comedy, Remini's hard-edged wit and Stiller's unique comic presence.",1184112000,12,1617,5.448
