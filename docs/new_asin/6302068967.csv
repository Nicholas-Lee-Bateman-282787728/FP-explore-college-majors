422408,1,6302068967,"I remember watching it once a long time ago, but don't remember much of it except being disappointed. Now reading everyone else's reviews, I now remember why. One piece of information not mentioned is that according to a filmography list (since I haven't seen it recently, so I don't know if it's accurate) the producer is Jennings Lang, the producer of what I think are great disaster films of the 1970s (Earthquake, Airport 1975, Airport '77, Rollercoaster, and The Concorde -- Airport '79). He produced a few more movies in the early '80s and then seemed to retire until his death in early 1996. But for him to be the producer of THIS film is VERY disappointing, but then I guess everyone can't have a perfect record.",1108944000,2,720,4.677165354330708
422409,2,6302068967,"To judge this movie depends on which way you look at it. On one hand it is pretty funny, and has some great scenes. So the movie is not a total flop as Max is given a mission to seek out where KAOS is hiding a bomb that when ignited, removes clothing, and KAOS threaten to use it to take over the fashion world.

However, what is missing here is familiar faces from the series, especially Barbra Feldon as 99. It is completely wrong that 99 is not here, and that Max has a new love interest in a completely different leading lady.

Had they have gotten Barbra to do the movie, or if the leading lady was NOT a love interest of Max's, this film would be considered great. But fans of the series will not swallow Max not being with 99, so that is where this movie fell hard on it's rear end.

Almost ten years after this, a re-union movie was made called, ""Get Smart Again"" and had 99 and as many familiar faces as they could get who where still around or hadn't passed on yet.
Definitely pick up that one, but as for this one, the only way I can make myself watch this one is to either ignore scenes with the new gal, or pretend it was supposed to be a prequel to when the series started.

Some parts where funny, some where recycled jokes from the TV series, but this movie of the return of Maxwell Smart was just a bad mistake with the directions they chose to go in. Even Don Adams himself said he wished he had not done this movie.

Get Smart was originally designed as a comedic version of James Bond, but as the character grew, it was set that Max only had one women, and wasn't the type to always have a new leading lady every week to fall in love with and have disappear without a trace the next. It is very painful to watch that when you love the TV series and love that Max and 99 are unseprable, and then this movie bombed that up.

This direction went wrong in trying to make Max more like James Bond then what people came to love about Maxwell Smart.",1085356800,,1962,4.12303664921466

Some of the same creative minds that were behind that show were involved with this movie, but not many of them.  The catchphrases are still here, but the effort is hollow.

The main reason to see the film, perhaps the only one, is to watch Don Adams reprise his Emmy winning portrayal and be reminded as to what a great, strong comic actor he is.  Don takes the often substandard material in this film and wrings many, many laughs from it.  The final twenty minutes actually recapture some of the original ""Get Smart!"" magic with a cloning sequence that predates ""Austin Powers"" as well as Mini-Me.

422447,4,6302068967,"Yeah, I saw that retread of a film project called ""Get Smart,"" and though I must admit I felt it was ""smart"" in some small random ways, overall it was ""Meh!"" at best, and ""Why am I still sitting here?"" at worst.

The Steve Carell / Dwayne Johnson vehicle had none of the charm or fun silly wit of the original program it was based upon, so Universal Studios (more than likely responding mainly to ""dollar signs"" rather than trying to give us something to help make-up for Warner Brothers' 2008 overhyped snoozer) dug into their archives and re-introduced the ""original"" Get Smart movie, so subversively named, ""The Nude Bomb""!

I saw this when it first came out in theaters and, despite the massive diss it's seemed to garner, thoroughly enjoyed it. And I find myself loving it even more, now that I have the luxury of being able to view it in my own dwelling quarters. All of the fun and escapist pleasure is still there as I'd remembered it, and I can't help but wonder how such a feeble attempt as Warner's yawnfest can get such awesome accolades while this one gets ""Razzie"" nominations -- am I missing something? (don't answer that)

No, ""The Nude Bomb"" is no masterpiece, but it understood the flavor and spirit of the television series that spawned it far better than the Warner attempt to reintroduce the character cinematically. It's not ""high comedy"" and it's not supposed to be: it is supposed to be a bit dry, droll and smirky -- the giggle-at-the-silliness-of-it-all type of humor that's supposed to exude charm rather than gut-ripping laughing outbursts, and that's what makes it so special in my book, because this type of humor fits the character of Maxwell Smart (and actor Don Adams) perfectly!

So sure, watch the Steve Carell ""Get Smart"" Warner Brothers movie if you want to [occasionally and semi-audibly] laugh, but watch ""The Nude Bomb"" if you want to laugh, giggle, smile, and overall be charmed!",1421712000,,1920,4.7395209580838324

422473,2,6302068967,"Like many people, I was anxious to see Maxwell Smart again, especially on the big screen.  The concept was cute, too-a mad fashion designer wants to send bombs all over the world to destroy clothing so everyone in the world would have to buy his products.  And most movies made from television shows simply put  whatever was on television onto the big screen, while the movie did include elements that wouldn't have fit into a television episode.  Unfortunately the movie's virtues end there.

""Get Smart"" was a parody of James Bond movies, and the movie goes so far as to have Maxwell Smart jumping out of an airplane, like in a then-recent Roger Moore Bond movie.  But though James Bond may have had a series of girlfriends, Maxwell Smart was married and had twin children-and yet Agent 99 is not around, but other women instead.  Nor are most of the original characters from the television series.  It's like having ""The Honeymooners"" with only Ralph Kramden in it.  Don Adams couldn't do it alone.

The movie tries to fit both into the actual Bond franchise as well as the original television show, but really fits into neither.",1403740800,,1132,4.729591836734694

I remember seeing this back in  May of 1980 with my father at an old movie theater in Hamden, Connecticut that isn't around anymore.  I'm very nostalgic about this film, it brings back so many good memories when going to the movies was fun.  I just adored Don Adams.  He was so funny!

Definitely a fun movie to watch from the era.  The Nude Bomb but there is no nudity just shirtlessness.

What's not so good: Most things, really. Although striking at first, some of the visual gags wore thin fast. Don Adams's acting was about the best of anyone's, and that's not saying much. (Kristel seemed more impressive in a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/role/dp/B000IY07G0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">role</a>&nbsp;where her physical presence mattered more than saying anything.) I did find some camp humor in the relatively ancient notions of what a computerized control room would look like, even though it wasn't meant as humorous back then.

Probably a good one for kids - actual nudity is brief and relatively demure, and the humor would probably tickle a middle-schooler. Or at least, a middle-school boy.

422514,1,6302068967,"for my money, this is the Industry's all-time missed opportunity. GET SMART is hands down the greatest series in the history of American television (and most likely it's future), so it's easy to see the appeal of a chance to revisit Maxwell Smart's world.
but what exactly was the appeal of doing such a half-assed job? i've seen episodes of THE SMURFS that bore more resemblance to the classic series than this debacle. only one regular besided Don Adams returns, namely Bob ""Larrabee"" Karvelas, and one frankly doubts that even he would've made it, were he not Don Adams' cousin. why was no attempt made to re-recruit 99, to say nothing of Siegfried or Hymie the robot?
but the casting is only a fraction of the problem. despite a ""written by"" credit for three GET SMART veterans (Arne Sultan, Bill Dana, and Leonard Stern, specifically), the damn thing doesn't come off as the work of someone who understands, or has even seen, the classic series. for instance, Max is transferred from CONTROL to an agency called PITS...as if they'd completely missed the cornerstone idea of the struggle between the forces of KAOS and CONTROL. one of the most basic puns, jettisoned completely!
one can only assume bringing Max into the budgetary realm of a James Bond appealed to someone...but more so than doing it right? did someone actually not mind the possibility of of said budget coming at the expense of quality of product? well, that sort of thing has happened before, hasn't it?
the good news is, they did manage to do so right a few years ago, via Steve Carrell, Anne Hathaway, Alan Arkin, and Terrance Stamp. granted, Don Adams had to die (the film was made as a sort of tribute), but then, since when did cinema magic not have it's price?",1339459200,,1740,4.7081967213114755

This is basically a lot of physical comedy. Some of it is still kind of funny, but it is definitely no cinematic masterpiece. The woman playing agent 22 is constantly showing a dewy eyed look, and the film is very misogynistic in that standard way of a certain era.

Still there are some laughs. My favorites were the cones of silence, humming communication hospital scene, the desk chase and the dance-like fight circle near the end. Also, the first time the bomb is detonated is funny as well, and agent 13 is fun to see popping up here and there.

Bottom line, it was fun to see this old film I remembered from my youth, but I definitely wouldn't buy it. Rental is entirely sufficient if you are curious and want a fun movie night.",1310169600,,1003,4.324468085106383

As for the movie itself, its terrible. I am a huge fan of the original series. I went in with low expectations. I was hoping for like a really long episode. But what I got was unwatchable trash. They shoe-horn in almost every catch phrase from the series within the first 20 minutes. I didn't laugh once. I will admit to grinning a few times, but that's it.
The plot in and of itself is the main thing resembling the original series. Smart has to stop a bomb that destroys fabric. I have no problem with that because that is what the series was like. Its the comedy that's the problem. It's simply not funny. A ton of ball jokes. And just because this is a movie, they feel the need to throw in a few curse words and one wet t-shirt scene which all feel out of place and forced.

Yes, I loved seeing Don back in action as Agent 86 again, and the premise of the film was, er, interesting.  Ahem.

I could forgive the absence of Edward Platt.  After all, he passed away in 1974.  I couldn't really overlook the absence of Barbara Feldon, and Max's resulting playboy attitude.  It just made the character seem that much more flawed.

In addition, the script is not so much a coherent narrative as it is an excuse to recycle everyone's favorite gags form the original ""Get Smart"" series.  There was way too much 12-cent slapstick.  Max could be counted to run into just about every fixed object on any given set face first.  Okay, so he was meant to be a bumbling detective, but this was too much, and again, it diluted the character.

There were some genuinely original moments, most notably Max's high-speed (if not exactly street-legal) desk, but they were few and far between.

The only thing that makes this film worth watching at all is Don Adams himself.  Although handed a sow's ear, he manages to do a reasonably decent job of trying to make a silk purse out of it, and almost carries it off - with all the charm, aplomb, and humor we came to expect of him.  I quite liked the dialogue betweem Max and Larabee - Larabee's paln to defeat the bomb is priceless.  Sadly it isn't enough to save the movie.

I saw that he didn't exactly play Maxwell Smart but more like an Austin Powers type, women falling all over him, the strange colorful villian that clones himself, but Adams didn't get too Risqu with the sexual talk like Austin Powers did.  But overall I happen to think that this movie was pretty funny.  I missed not seeing Barbara Feldman but my favorite scenes was the beginning of the film (very James Bondish) Him driving the desk all over the road after the bad guy and towards the end when Adams and the villian kept cloning themselves and you can even see a mini-Max for a few seconds.
So you can love it, you can hate it, but I personally thought it was a very entertaining spy spoof.",1216252800,,948,4.4
422546,2,6302068967,"Would you believe this no-frills DVD carries a $19.98 list price? Would you believe you can get a collection of 8 much-funnier Abbott & Costello features for less? Would you believe I would have given this DVD a three-star rating if only it were less than ten bucks?

I first saw THE NUDE BOMB on its initial theatrical release in 1980, in a crowded theater. While the audience guffawed appreciatively all the way through the picture, I only found myself chuckling and laughing intermittently. Maybe this audience wasn't as familiar with the TV series as I was, because I came away thinking this was a misfire. Don Adams was a gifted comedic actor and a pitch-perfect Maxwell Smart, but without crucial characters such as Agent 99 (Barbara Feldon), The Chief (Edward Platt, who died in 1974), and Siegfried (Bernie Kopell) for Adams to play off of, THE NUDE BOMB couldn't possibly achieve the TV series' level of comic brilliance.

As Don Adams lamented in later interviews, THE NUDE BOMB was made by a studio that didn't comprehend the appeal or intent of the original series -- and it shows. Even the title reveals this lack of understanding. In Europe the film was released as THE RETURN OF MAXWELL SMART -- a much better title, in my opinion -- yet in the U.S. it was distributed as THE NUDE BOMB, which makes it sound like a cheap softcore grindhouse flick.

Nevertheless, I don't believe THE NUDE BOMB is a terrible film. Don Adams tries hard to make the best of a less-than-ideal situation, and he manages to inject some laughs into this diluted affair. There are some clever and amusing moments, and a casual viewer may find it an agreeable spy-movie satire. But for those of us who love the original series, this is an awfully disappointing venture...and, ultimately, a pointless one.",1214870400,7,1793,4.758842443729904
422547,4,6302068967,"I think the main reason this movie gets so many poor reviews is because it does not stay true to the original series.  If you take this movie as a stand-alone film -- not expecting Agent 99 or the same Maxwell Smart as the old TV series -- then you may be able to enjoy it more.

There's a lot of good humor in this movie that just gets overshadowed by the ""this isn't the same Get Smart I used to know"" sentiment.",1213574400,21,414,3.9759036144578315

Would Max ever say stuff like, ""I thought our female agents were young and willing to fool around a lot."" None of the original writers or production stuff that created the brilliant original series were involved. Don Adams said that the funniest bits were stuff that was cut from the film. Very painful to watch...doesn't capture the feel of the original show at all. There was no humor whatsoever from the extremely dull KOAS actors. See Get Smart Again another time instead of this.

OK, so 99 and others are missing from the cast but this has much better pacing than ""The Return of Maxwell Smart"", the TV movie.  Nice backlot tour of Universal studios too.

No 99, No CONTROL, no Hymie, no KAOS, basically nothing from the original. And it's not that funny. BUT, there is a couple of chuckles here and there and it is an opportunity to see Don Adams in character once more. If you are a completist, get it. If you REALLY liked the original, buy the season sets from Time-Life or pick up the Get Smart Again! TV-movie on DVD (MUCH closer to the original - Sigfried, Hymie and 99 are all back).",1207008000,6,560,4.194444444444445
422552,2,6302068967,"Actually released in the cinemas, this lackluster attempt to bring the character of Maxwell Smart to the big screen fails miserably.  With none of the supporting cast from the television series to assist him, Don Adams does his best to get laughs with a sub par script.

We do get some of the classic lines (""Sorry about that, Chief"") and various visual gags, but the lack of true comedy (and the unfortunately obvious painted on hair on Adams) takes away from what could have been glorious.

Even the made-for-TV reunion movie ""Get Smart, Again"" was superior.  That venture was a labor of love, and everyone there genuinely wanted to be there.

7820934,3,6302068967,"Released in 1980 and directed by Clive Donner, The Nude Bomb brings back Don Adams as the bumbling agent Maxwell Smart in this parody of spy flicks, mostly the 007 franchise. Andrea Howard plays his new assistant, Agent 22, while Vittorio Gassman is on hand as the villain, an ee-vil fashion designer who blackmails the clothes-wearing public with the threat of total nudity via a Nude Bomb. Pamela Hensley and Sylvia Kristel play two other female agents. Rhonda Fleming is also on hand.

Coming out a decade after the demise of the Get Smart TV series that ran from 1965-1970, fans of the show tended to reject this movie version because it eliminated practically the entire peripheral cast and changed the good-guy organization from CONTROL to PITS, although it kept KAOS. The plot is just an excuse to string together as many mildly amusing silly gags as possible with the requisite low-budget set pieces and Bond-ian spoofs. The sequences include skydiving (Reminiscent of Roger Moors stint as 007), exposition on secret agent weapons, a long chase at Universal City, a Switzerland ski segment, the secret hideout in a mountain and more.

The big question is: Where is Barbara Feldon, who played Agent 99 on the series? Adams was told she turned the movie down, but she later informed him that she wasn't even contacted by the producers, likely because she was 45 at the time and they wanted a younger actress. This was a big mistake. But she returned for the TV movie Get Smart, Again in 1989, as well as a failed new Get Smart series in 1995.

If you can forgive the deviances from the show, this is a fun, somewhat amusing parody with a couple of laugh-out-loud scenes (e.g. the magazine at the newsstand). Unfortunately, the director has little eye for women and the flick generally drops the ball in this mandatory area. Still, it works as a comical period piece.

ADDITIONAL ACTORS: Dana Elcar, Norman Lloyd, Bill Dana, Gary Imhoff and Sarah Rush.

The film runs 94 minutes and was shot in at Universal Studios and Griffith Park, Los Angeles, California.
