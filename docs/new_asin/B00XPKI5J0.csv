8716408,2,B00XPKI5J0,only made it half way thru. soooooo slooooow  -- and not in a suspenseful way.  just slow,1514678400,,89,4.176470588235294
8716409,2,B00XPKI5J0,"This movie was over for me in 15 minutes. The character bonds are a shambles. The worst part is the choppiness of even everyday action, such as walking and movement. When the father slaps his son, there is no symmetry of motion. The film is cut before contact and the slap motion is pulled. That ended it for me. Whoever reviewed this with 5 stars, is friends with some of the first time actors. I understand loyalty to friends, but this is just plain amateur.",1510272000,,460,4.423529411764706
