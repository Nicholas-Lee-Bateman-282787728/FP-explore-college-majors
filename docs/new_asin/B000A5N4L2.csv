8338325,3,B000A5N4L2,"First off--the price. $45 for a 35 minute lecture followed by a 10 minute Q&A? This really looks like something you would see on youtube. Surprisingly, it was recorded in 2002 (I would have guessed 1980). The sound is bad. The video quality is poor. Hence, the 3 stars.

Szarkowski's lecture, however, is wonderful. The first 3 minutes (during which he pulls out of his coat pocket a second pair of glasses, seems to realize he is already wearing a pair, and then puts them back) demands some patience on the part of viewers not accustomed to giving great minds their deserved deference. After that, the pace picks up and is full of gems of thought on photography accompanied by photos of Atget, Evans, and others. In a series of slides that really showcase Szarkowski's curatorial gift, he creates a sort of poetry of influence between Atget, Evans, Adams, Cartier-Bresson, etc. I give the content 5 stars. Sadly, the poor picture quality doesn't do justice to the photos, and the sound seems to have been recorded solely from his lapel mic (which means that every time he turns to look at a slide the sound is lost). I would never pay $45 for this dvd. Luckily, I'm a professor, so I can just borrow it from the library--and so should you. This is the kind of dvd your local library should own and allow you to rent. I searched Youtube for it, but at this writing it's not there.",1325635200,3,1381,4.546184738955823
