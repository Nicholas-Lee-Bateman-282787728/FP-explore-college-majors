8559874,5,B00AZRHGU0,Great movie!,1477353600,,12,5.5
8559875,1,B00AZRHGU0,"Not very good. Poorly acted which made it feel silly at times, when the subject matter is anything but.
The occasional lecture about God's love and Jesus' support was just ridiculous.
Ask any kid who is being ferociously bullied where Jesus is on his list of supportive figures and you'll see he doesn't rank very high.
O just can't stand having religious messages jammed down my throat.
Religious agenda should have no part in this film.",1406073600,,438,4.776315789473684
8559876,1,B00AZRHGU0,Had a good message but was very low rent which made it hard to stay connected to the movie but again its good content,1387929600,,117,3.9166666666666665
8559877,1,B00AZRHGU0,"This isn't a documentary, its a low budget movie using the Columbine massacre as a back drop. Terrible. And a waste of time.",1382227200,2,124,4.434782608695652
