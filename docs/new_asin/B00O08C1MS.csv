8681177,4,B00O08C1MS,"I saw Elizabeth I back when it was released as a rental at the now disolved Bloskbuster.
When they had their close out sale I was able to purchase part 2 of the 2 disk release.
I really enjoyed the performances of these characters and Helen Mirren has made me a
fan. I would like to watch this movie again in its entirety if possible. Why has this HBO production been abandoned
and not release again to a newer and yournger fan base on Blu ray?
The performance of Hugh Dancy wasn't too shabby for you fans of his acting talents. Loved the cinematography
and the costume creations are an art in themselves. Its time to revisit this lovely jewel.",1461801600,,644,4.375
