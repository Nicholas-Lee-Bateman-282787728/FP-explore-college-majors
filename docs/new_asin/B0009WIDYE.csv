2327614,5,B0009WIDYE,This video takes the stress out of going through a class. We can review the different parts at our convenience.,1369180800,2,111,4.6
2327615,5,B0009WIDYE,These dance videos by Vicki Regan are truly as titled. The video makes dancing easy and fun. Try it and you will see that finally you can shed your fear of the dance floor. Enjoy!,1354406400,,179,4.142857142857143
2327616,5,B0009WIDYE,"This dance-video is an excellent manner for a beginner dancer to learn the Foxtrot (which is among the first dances that beginning ballroom dancers are introduced to).  The manner of instruction is relaxed.  The first minutes of the video provide the dance basis -- the underlying walking steps and the slow-slow/quick-quick tempo. Four dance moves are presented and the moves are presented step-by-step, one move at a time. Halfway thru the video (with the first two dance steps - basic forward/backward, rock-step) one can indeed say ""... hey!  I can do this!  I can dance!"".  At the end of the video (with the next two steps -- promenade, and the underarm turn) the viewer will agree that the Foxtrot is very easy to learn and a pleasure to dance.  [HINT: check if your local public library has the VHS-version of this dance instruction video.]",1150156800,13,847,4.847222222222222
2327617,5,B0009WIDYE,"This production, like all of Ms. Regan's instructional series with Ron De Vito, is an excellent introduction, at the beginner's level, to the ballroom dance, the foxtrot.  The repetition of the steps is adequate, without being overbearing or irritating.
This 57-year old intermediate dancer/reviewer found it very helpful for confirming the elementary figures.
No beginner should be disappointed.  3/10/2003  END",1047254400,9,412,5.833333333333333
2327618,5,B0009WIDYE,"You Can Dance Foxtrot by Vicki Regan is an excellent video for the  beginner with little or no previous dance experience.  She and her partner  Ron De Vito begin by walking in time to a basic foxtrot rhythm and in 45  minutes systematically build on this to teach the basic walk (forward and  back), the rock turn, the promenade and the promenade with turn.  In  addition they show ways to combine these four steps so that you can feel  comfortable improvising on the dance floor.
The tape is easy to follow  and you can practice alone or with a partner. Keep in mind however, that it  is targeted towards the beginner. If you've ever taken a foxtrot dance  class or looked at any other dance videos, you'll probably find this to be  to basic for you.",958435200,25,751,4.4411764705882355
8068385,2,B0009WIDYE,This is beginner dance moves.  There are only 4 moves taught on the entire CD.  I was very disappointed.,1520985600,,104,4.421052631578948
8068386,3,B0009WIDYE,It was a nice DVD but it would be nice if showed about 6 or 7 dance steps. I think it only showed you 2 or 3 dance steps. This is not enough to go to a nightclub or wedding.,1508889600,,173,3.35
8068387,4,B0009WIDYE,"I already learned to ballroom dance at a studio. When I remarried, my hub and I used this dance series, so he could learn. It's presented in an easy-to-follow format. They don't go too fast, and you actually learn the basics enough to go out on a dance floor The couple is not glamorous, but they know how to teach ballroom. We got the DVD for all the six standard ballroom dances and can practice any time at home.",1482192000,,415,4.265822784810126

8068392,5,B0009WIDYE,This dance video was great.  It gives you plenty of time to learn the steps and you can go back over and over and really get the feel for the moves.  The price was great and I am going to buy more.  Thank you.,1406851200,2,209,3.7045454545454546
