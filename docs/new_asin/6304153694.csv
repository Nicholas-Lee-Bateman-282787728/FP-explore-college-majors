796393,5,6304153694,"This film is wonderful.  Filmed on the beautiful plains of Manitoba, Canada, it has some wonderful scenery that is sorely lacking in todays congested films.  It is my opinion that the acting was well done  throughout, as the characters being portrayed are for the most part young  men/boys, ill prepared for the horrors they are to face, and have grown up  in a different era.  One particular actor to watch for (demand!) is Guy  Stewart, who plays Richard, whose scenes in the film were edited, yet what  was left is a tease of what may yet be (giggles)
A wonderful film through  and through, if you are prepared to lose yourself to the tradgedies of  another era.  Adds to my understanding of those who have gone before.
It  was the top ranking film in Winnipeg, Manitoba for a couple of months with  many veterans and older ladies reliving their memories with the portrayal  on screen.
I thank all who participated for this gift.  I would love to  have more opportunities to see Guy Stewart's (Richard) acting abilities  better utilized on screen, as I'm certain that he has many gifts to  demonstrate, other than those portrayed.",947462400,6,1133,4.723076923076923
796394,4,6304153694,"The story is quite good, depicting a real look at the way WWII affected people's emotions. Russell Crowe is excellent as the Aussie heartbreaker. The film may suffer slightly from the secondary romance, but it fits well  within the overall plot of the movie. It made me want to be right in the  middle of it.

796535,4,6304153694,"I agree with all that F.J. Powell wrote.  I liked the soap opera very much, but it is not as well done as the better Korean ones I have watched.  I speak Mandarin at an intermediate level and am a devotee of the writings of Lin Yu Tang, one of the real masters of fiction and analysis of East and West. The two stories are almost completely different.

I can understand and accept the license given to filmmakers who, because of the 2-3 hour length of a movie compared to the length of time it take it takes to read a novel, often must delete portions of the novel or make artistic changes in the script.  What I can not understand or accept is when the writers have 44 hours of script, they don't follow the novel closely at all.  In my mind, this DVD is very disingenuous or dishonest.  They have basically taken Lin Yu Tang's name and the title of his novel and used it to title their miniseries, just for commercial gain and profit, it seems, while leaving out nearly all of the rich details and epic story which he wrote.",1371254400,,1026,4.262886597938144

796587,4,6304153694,"This film shows the innocence and ways of the time during WWII in Canada. You don't see many war movies focusing on Canada.  It showed families coping with their own being taken far away to fight and how they welcomed visiting airman trainees from around the world.  To encourage them and keep the spirits high among the soldiers.  They were mostly from England and Australia. With all war movies, their is the underlying moral tone, a married woman and a soldier.  She, in part, I believe has the affair with him because he both felt and impressed on her that he might not make it through his first bombing mission.  He wanted a memory of love and friendship to take him through the war, even if his enlistment lasted only one mission.  I wasn't too happy with the ending, but that's probably what happened alot in those days.  He went on his mission and left her behind.  It is up to you to decide if you think he makes it.  You are never shown.

This may be one of Russell Crowe's first movies, I am not sure.  The descriptions of Australia by Russell Crowe, while walking on the beach with his girlfriend is one of the  parts of that I like about this film.  If you are interested in the Australian way of life and slangs, you will be drawn to this movie.  Russell's descriptions you can tell are from the heart.  He didn't have to dig deep when he describes Australia and his love for it.

It has its slow moments, but what movie doesn't?  I would give this film 3.5 stars.  Well done performances by everyone.",1275955200,7,1515,4.388489208633094

796589,1,6304153694,"I wish I could rate this transaction a zero, but I don't find a way to do that.

The copy of the movie that was sent to me is, I believe, a ""bootleg"" copy.  Although it came in a what appeared to be a legitimate cover, there are several suspicious things about it.  First, the cover says that the run time is 120 minutes.  The copy sent to me only runs 95 minutes.  I ordered the same movie from Netflix just to compare - the Netflix version is 25 minutes longer and contains A NUMBER of scenes not shown in the one I purchased.  Almost without exception, each of the omitted scenes were fairly significant to the overall impact of the story line of the movie.  Additionally, the copy sent to me was of very poor video quality compared to the one from Netflix.

796590,4,6304153694,"I bought this not to watch a Chinese soap opera but to help my Chinese listening skills.  I'm in the intermediate level, so I still need subtitles, but I know enough to pat myself on the back when I don't need the subtitles and nod when I'm reminded of a usage or vocabulary item that I had almost forgot.  So, as Chinese practice for someone like me, it certainly delivers the goods.  As a soap opera (some might take exception to that term for these dvd's) it's also worth your time.  The families are sympathetic and the characters are often more three dimensional than they have any business being.  And you do care about what happens next.  So it is a winner as both Chinese practice and as a tv show.",1229904000,,706,4.351145038167939
796591,5,6304153694,"I read the original novel years ago and never liked it because it was too tailored to an American audience.  This 2004 TV drama, loosely based on the original novel, is so much better.  It's shot in a relaxed, soap operatic style with great set design and constume design.  The characters feel realistic (e.g., when compared to characters in movies shot back in the 30s and 40s) and you get to like them.  Vicky Zhao and Fu Miao (who portrays Vicy's rival) do a great job.  DVD quality is pretty good.",1208390400,,501,4.461538461538462
796592,4,6304153694,"As a huge fan of Russell Crowe I had to research this movie and give it a try.  While it is not as polished a movie as it could have been it still brings an adequate amount of charm and heart and makes for a memorable and satisfying cinematic experience.

Crowe stars as Lachlan, a fighter pilot in training who happens to fall in love with a married woman.  That woman is Lill, a lonely yet charming woman whose husband is away at war.  Lachlan and Lill's relationship is one kept secret from those around them for it is a forbidden love.  As the two of them come closer together, Lachlan's inevitable departure to war creeps up on them with stinging effect.

`For the Moment' is not a film that I would consider masterful or brilliant.  There have been plenty of romantic war epics that have surpassed this without even really trying, but what `For the Moment' has going for it is, like I mentioned, pure charm and heart.  A pre-stardom Crowe is magnetic here.  While this is far from his more polished and mature roles it is one that shows quite gloriously that he's had the ability all along.  Christianne Hirt is marvelous as Lill, emoting loneliness and despair as well as a heightened desire and fire when she meets and falls for Lachlan.

Director Aaron Kim Johnston keeps the focus on the budding love affair, so anyone looking for an action filled war film should look the other way.  This is not a war film in the literal sense but a film about the war of love and the fact that love takes innocent casualties at will.

I'd recommend `For the Moment' to any fan of Crowe; anyone that wants to see where this action giant came from.  Unarguably Crowe has become one of our greatest and most respected working actors, but he didn't just fall from the sky; he has roots.  `For the Moment' is one of those roots.  It's well worth the money and the time and will prove satisfying to the audience.  It's superbly acted and wonderfully constructed.  No, it's not perfect and yes there are better films to occupy one's time but `For the Moment' has enough going for it to validate a watch through.",1205712000,2,2100,4.467191601049869
796593,3,6304153694,"This miniseries is OK. But I have some pretty strong feelings about it after having begun to watch the episodes. The things I like about this series: 1) it's a great way to practice listening to Chinese; they speak slowly and distinctly, and the vocab is easy to understand for beginners/intermediate learners. 2) it's highly dramatic 3) the twists and turns do keep you wondering what will happen next.

The things I disliked about this series 1) the writers turned Lin Yu Tang's masterpiece (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Moment-in-Peking-a-Novel-of-Contemporary-Chinese-Life/dp/B000NXMVOM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Moment in Peking a Novel of Contemporary Chinese Life</a>) into confetti,  scooped out the subtle and nuanced characters and events, and left finger puppets in their place; they completely ignored the first quarter of the book about the childhood adventures of the main characters and how their lives were woven together from across the length and breadth of China. 2) they've dropped main characters, conflated characters, even transposed events 20/30 years forward or backward, it's very much a soap opera, not a loving, detailed look at imperial/pre WWII Chinese family life, history and culture. 3) the costuming for the main characters is sort of distracting and not correct-- Mulan, Mochow and Mannia wear revealing Shanghai cheongsam through the streets of 1910 Beijing that would have made hookers blush. 4) It obvious that the writers/producers had no concept of what China was like before the Cultural Revolution. They should've read Lin Yutang's book for some ideas...

Still, the sheer amount of running time of this series is great (something like 44 hour long episodes)! Pull out your fan and set out tea cups, the pistachios and candied haws...you could have a Summer long Chinese (soap) opera marathon without traipsing to a teahouse, nor yet ever leaving your home!",1205625600,4,1941,5.595238095238095
796594,4,6304153694,Good heartwarming story.  I recommend it highly.  Russell Crowe's early attempt at acting was a complete success.,1182816000,,113,5.588235294117647
796595,4,6304153694,"This was how President Franklin Roosevelt described Canada, the seemingly perfect location to train Royal Air Force and Canadian Royal Air Force pilots in the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan, a large and successful military pilot training program during World War Two.  Russell Crowe delivers an impressive performance as a young bomber pilot in training who woos a local married woman with his looks and charm.  As a war film buff, I do not really care for all the sentimentality (no matter how well acted) but I must praise this obscure low-budget Canadian film for bringing to light an important aspect of the Allied war effort which took place in quiet rural Manitoba.  This movie is set during the early years of WWII since it included a few American trainees, one of whom is an arrogant, rude and lecherous villian who is the opposite of Russell Crowe's mild-mannered Australian character.  Choosing an American to be the movie's villian seemed a bit contrived to me, but there was around 1759 Americans in the RAF who transferred to the US military when America finally entered the war.  When watching the movie, or just looking at the DVD cover, one will notice that the air force uniform has a much DARKER SHADE OF BLUE than the familiar RAF uniforms seen in ""Battle of Britain"".  This was something that my eyes had to get used to when watching this sentimental but nonetheless interesting film.",1158883200,,1412,4.8625
796623,4,6304153694,"For The Moment reminds us that Canada once was a proud nation who pulled its own weight.  [...].  A much younger Russell Crowe portrays an Australian pilot who is undergoing further training in Manitoba, Canada during WWII.  He eventually begins an affair with a woman whose husband has already departed for combat.  The relationship is likely doomed from the start.  Will Crowe's character even survive the war?  Most pilots are killed within months after their departure.  The people around these illicit lovers also have their own troubles.  Should everyone live for the immediate present?  Is there logical reason to invest in a long term future hopes?

Russell Crowe is now one of our greatest film actors.  He doesn't get much of a chance to show his ability in this movie.  Crowe's role essential calls for a paint by the numbers approach.  Still, this is a decent production.  It aptly deals with the frustrations and challenges of those who saved our civilization from tyranny.  WWII buffs should take a chance on For The Moment. I give it 3 1/2 stars.",1127260800,6,1061,4.849162011173185
796624,4,6304153694,"I didn't havea clue what this movie was about or what it had to offer when I picked it up.  All I knew was it starred Russell Crowe and that was all I needed to know.  It's set during war times, Crowe plays a pilot in training and while staying with a friend and his fiance he falls for the fiance's married sister.  Risky waters there Mr Crowe, but a romance ensues and it leads to an uproar of sorts.  Who can blame the young lady.  Crowe's charm is undeniable (heck, I'm a heterosexual married man and I'd fall for him...sorry sweetheart) just listen to his redition of ""High Flight"".  Beware all you 'Pearl Harbor' 'Saving Private Ryan' watchers, this is not a war movie even though it's labeled as one.  This is a romance film with VERY little action at all.

Pilots-in-training find love with very nice women.  Russell Crowe plays ""lachlan"" who is from Australia.  He begins a nice friendship with a women (Christine Hirt) on a farm.  it becomes a tender, forbidden romance.  Lachlan wanted love and found it, even if it was for the moment.

First, let me say that I love Russell Crowe and anything that he does, but this movie showed a side of him I just loved-cute, cocky, spouting poetry and singing with his wonderful Aussie accent. You can't help but love him! The movie starts out bright and happy with Lachlan and Johnny, soaring in a Tiger Moth to Pachelbel's Canon, going to meet Johnny's girl. Lachlan is drawn to her married sister. Lachlan's take on life is that it's a collection of moments, that stay with you forever. I couldn't agree more.

This is more a rental-sit-at-home-and-watch type of film but a delight nonetheless. It is a sweet love story between an air pilot and a woman whose husband is at war and lonely, not knowing when he is returning. She slowly develops a friendship turning into a relationship with Crowe. It is a nice and entertaining film and Crowe is wonderful in it. The actress, Christianne Hirt, is sweet but not much chemistry between them. but it will be worth it to hear Crowe sing ""Waltzing Matilda"" while bathing and just to hear the classic line...""I have come to take you to the seaside Madame.""

The script creates a main plot which could be worthy of film but then creates so many sub-plots and diversions which are given equal billing, that the main plot is totally sacrificed.  The acting (with the exception of Crowe) is right off the high school stage. Zeke's love affair with the local ""camp whore/bootlegger"" is meant to be touching/romantic but I found it to be fodder for emotional cripples. Several moments make the film worth watching if you can borrow it or buy it cheaply; firstly, the scenery from the low flying plane sequences is superb; secondly, Crowe manages to hold the story together; thirdly, Zeke's incredible, mind bending request of Lachlan(Crowe);fourthly, the ""Waltzing Matilda"" scene is extemely well done!",998524800,,778,5.0703125
796631,3,6304153694,"Opinions, here's mine. This is a foreign film, foreign as in they consider film an art form not an industry (thanks Sam Mendes) This is a story of another time, where the pace people lived at was different than now. That fact needs to be apparent from the beginning of the film. The Pachelbel Canon is a beautiful choice for flying music when you don't have a big budget.  I liked these characters. I felt for their situations and understood how you could get there. Top of my list of scenes: Russell Crowe reciting ""High Flight"" it was done beautifully. I'd like to see and hear him do Shakespeare.  One of the other reviewers said they felt the character of Lill was ""wooden"". Was she? Or was it her character trying to resist Lachlan? I felt like she knew, from the beginning, she could never give in totally to him . In just a few weeks he'd be gone, like her husband, who she had loved too. So, was she ""wooden"" or was she just saving a part of herself so she could survive sending these people she loved off to war? I did enjoy ""Waltzing Matilda"".  On the whole it was a sweet movie more of what you would have expected from the 1940's... and wasn't that the idea. They threw in more current concerns as homosexuality and racism which makes it more 1990's. Nice film.",989884800,2,1273,4.362869198312236

796677,3,6304153694,"It's easy to say the movie bogs down in mushy melodrama, but the way such opulent love is pitted against the tragedy of a war, the result is quite befitting.  ""For the Moment"" plays out like the younger sister of ""The English Patient"", starting with a sublimely beautiful opening shot, and proceeding on to delicately break our hearts, even if the story seems too romantic to be plausible (which is not entirely true).  There's a great performance from Crowe, and a notable one from Hirt.  Great music and scenery.  The movie can be described as nothing truly orginal, but hats off for the great effort and the way they expand on the theme.  Even if it seems too goody-goody for it's own good, ""For the Moment"" does have its moments: Crowe's recital of ""High Flight"", the lovers singing ""Waltzing Matilda"", and several notably memorable lines of dialogue (""Best to just feel my way around."")

The  opening flight scene is worth the price of this movie.  I suppose it could  be said that some of the other cast members were ""weak"" (as  previously complained), but I found it nice not to be manipulated by big  star emoting in this sweet story and very endearing that Christianne Hirt  had a couple very bad hair days throughout the film.  (Is that why she kept  referring to her hair during the ""sea shore"" scene?) The children  in this film were hilarious...especially the little boy as he hardly said a  word, but kept me giggling. What else can be said about Russell Crowe that  hasn't already been expressed?  He was born for the silver screen and  aren't we movie addicts lucky!

796679,4,6304153694,"Before seeing this film, I was unaware of the training experiences of the Allied forces in Canada.  I enjoyed the historical aspects of the film, as well as the beautiful scenery of Manitoba.  The story was bittersweet; for  in war time, some people are torn apart while others are thrown together.  This movie also illustrated that very well.  Russell Crowe manages to  convey such subtle nuance in his work, and this film is no exception.  This  is a keeper; one I enjoy viewing when I want to smile through my tears.",963964800,25,519,4.626373626373627

796681,5,6304153694,"I must say that this is Russell Crowe at his best.  It's not often that you get to see him playing his true nationality.  The story of Lill and Lachlan is true romance at its best.  I especially enjoyed the underlying  story of Betsy and Zeek and I couldn't help wanting to know more about  these two characters.  The scenery and the music in the film is  breathtaking and the two love stories give an insight of what it must of  been like in 1942 to only have a short time with the people you love.  Living in the UK I don't get to see much of Russell Crowe's early stuff,  but this is definitely one I've added to my video collection.  If you like  a good love story (and Russell Crowe), I'd recommend it to anyone!",963878400,8,717,4.153284671532846

796683,3,6304153694,"Opinions, here's mine. This is a foreign film, foreign as in they consider film an art form not an industry (thanks Sam Mendes)
This is a story of another time, where the pace people lived at was different than now.  That  fact needs to be apparent from the beginning of the film.  The Pachelbel  Canon is a beautiful choice for flying music when you don't have a big  budget.
I liked these characters. I felt for their situations and  understood how you could get there. Top of my list of scenes: Russell Crowe  reciting ""High Flight"" it was done beautifully. I'd like to see  and hear him do Shakespeare.
One of the other reviewers said they felt  the character of Lill was ""wooden"".  Was she? Or was it her  character trying to resist Lachlan? I felt like she knew, from the  beginning, she could never give in totally to him . In just a few weeks  he'd be gone, like her husband, who she had loved too. So, was she  ""wooden"" or was she just saving a part of herself so she could  survive sending these people she loved off to war?
I did enjoy  ""Waltzing Matilda"".
On the whole it was a sweet movie more of  what you would have expected from the 1940's... and wasn't that the idea.  They threw in more current concerns as homosexuality and racism which makes  it more 1990's. Nice film.",961286400,19,1289,4.362869198312236

This is not even the same movie--it has all the cohesive story lines ripped out of it, and you don't even see any of the real life issues that were addressed in the actual film that I have on VHS that binds the story together and gives it meaning and made it so far ahead of it's time when it was originally made.  I guess some stupid idiot editor decided to make it a senseless disconnected story that doesn't even ring true and has the heart torn out of it.  It was a beautiful movie--some of the best work I ever saw in the 90's and the first thing that I ever saw Russell Crowe in and knew he was a star from Moment One--AND it was based on historical facts that most people in the states never even knew about the Manitoba Airmen--and it has been destroyed.  I am outraged and so sad.  This chopped up version is a travesty.  I guess i need to be looking for a VCR that still works, instead!!!!!!",1489795200,,924,4.105555555555555

7863365,2,6304153694,"So irritated that some of my favorite scenes from this treasured movie are not in this version. For some hideous reason it was butchered and they edited some great moments....especially when Russell Crowe recites the poem High Flight by John Magee. That moment was crucial in the bonding of these two characters. Without it you feel less of a connection.
