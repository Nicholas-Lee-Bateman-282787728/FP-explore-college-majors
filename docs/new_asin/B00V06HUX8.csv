Estoy investigando la historia espaola para poder entender mejor lo que est sucediendo ah (no soy de Espaa). He disfrutado mucho los primeros diez episodios y espero con anticipacin ver los dems.

The concept for El Ministro del Tiempo is fascinating and the show is very well executed with top-notch acting and story lines. Im researching Spanish history so I can better understand what is going on (Im not from Spain). I have enjoyed the first ten episodes very much and look forward to watching the rest of them.

Note: I got a friend to translate my English review into Spanish. Amazon Spain, where I purchased it from, doesn't allow reviews until a certain amount of money has been spent and this was my first purchase from them. I only know a little Spanish (tourist Spanish learned over ten years ago for a visit to Spain--and I was glad I learned it because they didn't speak English!--and why would they? It was Spain.). Watching it has been a challenge with my limited Spanish language skills. It is nevertheless quite interesting, albeit when two characters are talking at length I have little idea of the content. If someone wants to create a Spanish-English dictionary that only includes words used in this show that would help me a lot! Still, even missing a lot I'm understanding more and more as I watch (improving my Spanish, I think) and it is very enjoyable. When I've looked afterwards for episode summaries it turns out I've understood them pretty well--in fact I think I understood one of the the details of one episode better than the summary writer. Lots of fun and food for thought about history and individual people's role in it.

I'm so glad I found out about these (there was an NYT article that said if you enjoy A you might enjoy B, and this was B).",1525996800,,1912,4.667655786350148
8708865,4,B00V06HUX8,I watch the first three seasons on Netflix. It's in Spanish but has decent subtitles that are readily readable. There's a couple episodes that are really goofy but most of it's actually a pretty good combination of Science Fiction time travel and a little bit of Spanish history. I enjoyed it. Of course the Spanish see their history just a little different than people looking from the outside-in. That part was interesting as well.,1523145600,,433,4.864864864864865

8708867,5,B00V06HUX8,"Fabulous first season of this science fiction / historical Spanish series.  Excellent balance of history, imagination and diverse periods.  Outstanding actors and production.  Can hardly wait for the second season DVDs to be released!  A fan in the greater Washington DC metropolitan area.",1465084800,,289,5.651162790697675
