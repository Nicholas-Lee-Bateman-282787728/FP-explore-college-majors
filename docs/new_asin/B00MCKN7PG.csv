6568077,5,B00MCKN7PG,"The balance between the  raw violence and flawed humanity of these character's is so intriguing that no matter how awful their choices or actions are, you can still feel compassion for them because it all comes from a place of desperation to make their dreams come true when life handed them nothing but tools with which to fail. I've never seen a show or film accomplish this so effortlessly. The characters and story are original and portrayed brilliantly by all the actors, plus the cinematography is spectacular, all punctuated by an amazing soundtrack. It's blade touting, gun slinging gangsters with ambition in fine taylored suits and a Birmingham accent, who sometimes flash us a piece if their hearts. So interesting and entertaining. Just be patient with the first episode because it's purpose is to carefully introduce you to the time, place, and circumstances that face and drive the Peaky Blinders...after that enjoy, enjoy, enjoy!  P.S. also be prepared for the disappointment that each season is only six episodes,  but like Sherlock it's so worth the wait for the next installment.",1434499200,2,1097,5.083333333333333
6568078,5,B00MCKN7PG,"Peaky Blinders is a terrific period UK gangland drama set in the early 20th century. This series is completely mesmerizing and is one of the elite episodic dramas I have ever seen. As Good As Sons Of Anarchy is, Peaky Blinders is a cut above that and similar series and is easily in league with shows like True Detective, Game Of Thrones and The Sopranos. Be prepared to be blown away at the actor's performances; the direction and writing level is beyond excellent.

Cillian Murphy is beyond TERRIFIC as the lead and carries the show with ease. This series is a Netflix Original in the US so if you don't a region free Blu Ray player you can stream season 1 and 2 on Netflix now. Be prepared to be completely hooked and engrossed as was I.

6568082,1,B00MCKN7PG,"I've watched all of season 1 and half of season 2, and, for me, this show just gets worse and worse.  I'd call it ""grubby"", rather than gritty.  It presses all of the right buttons, grubbing for our sympathy--mainly blind loyalty to family and the military (though it doesn't show any sympathy for merry old England of the period between the world wars).  There is plenty of gratuitous and graphic blood and violence, most of it about as predictable as the sex scenes (which are relatively tame, compared with the violence).  I can't find a single person in this series whom I would call sympathetic--even Winston Churchill seems to be a schemer with few redeeming qualities.  If you don't think humanity makes progress through time, this show has just the right blend of cynicism and pessimism for you.  If you can't stand the reality TV shows that glorify our basest and most idiotic neighbors, stay away.",1423699200,,907,4.782051282051282
6568083,5,B00MCKN7PG,"Cinematic. Flawless. Hardcore! Violent-but in a lyricaI artistic way. I can't begin to describe what Peaky Blinders is. It's only on Netflix, or dvd.
Loved it so much I bought the dvd's. I LOVE THIS SHOW. Peaky Blinders? Yes. The lead, Tommy Shelby (played by Cillian Murphy) is insanely amazing. He's incredibly flawed, yet so driven ""I'm a businessman"" If you've seen Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels, or Ripper Street they might prime you a little bit for viewing Peaky Blinders. It's hard to explain-this show is pure magic, perfectly filmed, edited, and the acting. So.much.fun. It's all gangster! Based in post WW1 Birmingham, this is an epic crime drama that pushes the limits. The bad guys are bad-the law? Chief C.I. Campbell played by Sam Neill-who's so good, you'll hate him! Also starring Tom Hardy (hello...Hurt Locker, Lawless), Tommy Flanagan, and the lovely Helen McCrory. The women! Gutsy, strong and intelligent. You'll enjoy the soundtrack-it's modern and not prissy like many of these period piece dramas are. Then thank me profusely for telling you about this genius show.",1422748800,9,1093,5.0777777777777775

6568085,5,B00MCKN7PG,"Peaky Blinders is a beautifully produced, wonderfully acted crime drama that can stand next to the best the US has to offer.  Not only is the cast amazing, the writing excellent and the music great, you also have Cillian Murphy as Tommy, the head of the Shelby clan, a family inclined to criminal activity living in post WW1 Birmingham, England.  Tommy, as played by Cillian Murphy, wants to get out of Birmingham and expand the family businesses of horse betting and bootlegging into London market and drags his family along with him with all their problems and family strife.  I can't say enough about Cillian Murphy.  I felt every bit of his character Tommy, along with all that goes with him; his attempts at intimacy, his frustrations with his family and his vulnerability.  I loved him, he is brilliant!",1419897600,4,809,4.7913669064748206

This is, as has been noted, a tour de force.  Peaky Blinders comes from the head covering worn with razor blades sewn in the bill.  Swung as a weapon, this was most often used across the face and thus blinded opponents.

Irish actor Cillian Murphy stars as Thomas 'Tommy' Shelby, the head of the Blinders.  Set in 1919, just after the war, three Shelby brothers, Arthur (Paul Anderson), the oldest and enforcer as a former boxer and someone who cannot shake the war, Tommy (Murphy), a Sergeant Major in the war and natural leader and John (Joe Cole), the third oldest and also an enforcer.  With sister Ada (Sophie Rundle) and Aunt Polly (Helen McCrory), the Blinders take over Birmingham one shop at a time.  Tommy has a vision for the Shelby's.  He wants all the betting shops, legal or no, wharfs and docks and men in place to move fare from hither to yon.

The acting in this series is absolutely superb.  Murphy, Anders and Cole feel as though they are actually brothers.  Aunt Pol, the woman who kept the operation going while the men were 'away to France' (tunnel rats in the British Army), has the respect of the brothers and very little is done without her knowledge and/or consent.  This is another series in which the ""Bad Guys"" are the heroes in a Robin Hood sort of way.  The characters are in no way comic book characters.  These are believable people both individually and as a family.  Not since Sopranos has something been this close.

Peaky Blinders is brilliant television.  One can watch it several times, and we have, and get more and more out of the program.  Each episode, a paltry six to a season, (but packed with oh-so-much) takes the viewer deeper and deeper into Birmingham, the Blinders operation and the Shelby family.",1465776000,2,2605,6.186111111111111
8671640,5,B00MCKN7PG,"I looked on IMBd for a high rated TV show and saw this, I really like Cillian Murphy as an actor so I figured Id give it a shot,  wow was I blown away.  This show is very entertaining, set in early 1900 UK it's a great old style gangster show  with a sympathetic yet criminal  family trying to make it in the slums of a low middle class or poor neighborhood. It's very artistic and the suspense is excellent.  Season 1 is only 6 episodes and let me tell you it does not take long for this show to hook you,  it literally takes off running unlike so many other season 1 TV shows. Give it a shot it's getting great reviews by users and critics alike, and for good reason.",1457049600,,669,4.03030303030303

Birmingham 1919. Great Britain is just coming out of the First World Wars butchery and slaughter and has to face three main problems: the rebellion or upheaval in Ireland, the discontentment of the people after the war and their leaning towards Marxism, communism and a violent revolution. Finally all kinds of trafficking people who try to build businesses on the basis of some more or less, rather more than less, criminal activities with the rivalry between or among gangs and families, and among these gangs and families there are the gypsies. A super cop is moved from Ireland to Birmingham to clean up the plate after an important shipment of weapons and ammunitions were stolen.

The series describe the bleak and gruesome living conditions of the working class and their direct members who organize the various services like the circulation of alcohol and tobacco, the various fights in illegal or irregular boxing rings, the betting on horses and other things with bookmakers. The cops are complacent, very corrupted or lets say blind and they want some kind of peaceful service even if violence is everywhere around. The new cop sent by London is not exactly what they would call a pacifying element.

The series is well done, extremely well acted and quite suspenseful. It shows how among the families who exploit the bleak situation there are rivalries that are warlike more than fair play. Everything is good to get what the others have, to increase your territory and your influence by getting rid of others, of competitors. Competition in other words is always to the death.

There is in other words no ethics anywhere and even the communists who are self-sacrificing are not really better because their objective is to force society in one direction rather than the other by using the discontentment of many to turn them into their most of the time unarmed infantry.

The series gives some depth to the plot by having a female operative from Ireland brought into Birmingham and the territory of one family, the Shelbys, and both the new cop (quite older than her) and the main young brother of the Shelbys fall in love with her. She is the traitor among the Shelbys and she in fact betrays both the cop who she does not like at all though or because he is her superior officer and the young Thomas Shelby since she manages to reveal to the cop where the stolen weapons are, bringing the two main gangs to a confrontation that could have been a blood bath, and that was the very calculation of the cop. Could have been and was not because of some unforeseen development.

The Irish problem is never really taken into any deep consideration. It is only a circumstantial though dangerous element that is in no way either justified or exposed. It is a looming drama behind the scene hardly visible on the stage. The Irish Republican Army does not strut around in plain daylight in Birmingham.

Quite interesting altogether, even if it is maybe slightly bleaker than what it was in reality. But who really knows or remembers?

The second series widens the geographical frame and leads the Shelbys to London. The Irish are definitely on the back burner and Winston Churchill is quite obviously playing a game of his own against the new cop who came from Ireland and cannot think in other terms than the IRA. Winston Churchill must be seeing beyond the Irish problem and seeing that the inner English problem is more dangerous for the crown than the Irish rebellion to which anyway they yielded then.

Thats where moving to London and trying to start an export business the Shelbys came in full confrontation with two other organized shady and fuzzy business gangs in this field of entertainment, alcohol and tobacco. The Italians and the Jews. The Italians want to be over everyone, so the Shelbys who are identified as the Gypsies tie up an alliance with the Jews against the Italians who saw the danger and then tie up a new alliance with the Jews against the Gypsies. Three groups that are defined ethnically, culturally and religiously who try to take control of the entertainment business with the enormous US market presently shaken by prohibition and yet next door to Canada which is not concerned but is a marvelous entry gate.

Those three groups are in a struggle that looks more like a war but it is essential to understand modern England. England had a bill of rights and other more common law than constitutional basic civil rights but for a long time limited to the Protestants, the Catholics being excluded. When they had to move away from this segregation they introduced or maintained (since Italian and Gypsies are Catholics and Jews are not exactly Protestants) other discriminations against other communities essentially seen as non-English. The Italians are obvious since they are of foreign origin and Mussolini is going to come to power and Italian refugees, mostly communists, are going to increase in numbers. The Jews are less obvious but anti-Semite feelings in England have always been high in the past, Shakespeare being a good example there, or Dickens. And these Jews have strange customs that are kind of shocking to the English. Finally the Gypsies have always been some kind of social enemy and social marginal group that was always engaged in shady business with the reputation of practicing prostitution, drug dealing, illegal betting and illegal fights, and many other niceties of the type.

The most dangerous fact is that they are all back from the First World War where they learned how to use weapons and how to fight and they do not want to be downtrodden any more.

In this society the real danger is the possibility for the communists to conquer a vast influence based on discontentment. So the best way is to come to terms with some of the shady groups so that they will entertain the lower classes and prevent discontentment from becoming dangerous revolutionary enterprises or adventures. In this second series this communist danger is mostly marginalized and Winston Churchill wants to take the control of the entertainment business and he considers the gypsies are the least dangerous in that line.

So while the new cop from Ireland, who does not from my point of view deserve a name because he is not doing police work but civil war military action, is going on with his plan of getting rid of one higher up military officer who has in a way or another in the new cops mind betrayed his ideals in Ireland, and whats more he is going on with his secondary plan of using Thomas Shelby to fulfill the first, Winston Churchill plans saving Thomas Shelby from the hands of this new cop from Ireland and keeping him in store for some objective we cannot know.

This exploration of discriminatory and racist England is interesting because we would not think it was like that so little time back, and yet it is the lessons learned from this period that explains the policy with various communities who have their autonomy and their self governing powers in various fields like education. What others in the world call communitarianism is totally recognized in England and it works rather well when connections and relations are established between and among the communities within city councils and borough boundaries. We are here at the roots of English reformist conservatism which kills the left most of the time who wants to impose some principles that go against practical realism in social matters.

Of course this series has to get rid of a couple of people who are blocking the future and to save a couple more without whom there would be no future. In other words the next series is thus clearly prepared.
