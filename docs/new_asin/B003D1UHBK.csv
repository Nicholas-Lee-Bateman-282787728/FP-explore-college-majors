8394612,4,B003D1UHBK,"Royal Rumble:
The 16th annual edition of this event was highlighted by the traditional Royal Rumble match but with a different twist as this was the first Rumble match since the RAW/SmackDown ""brand extension"" with each brand having a separate World Championship so the Rumble would have have 15 members from each brand with the winner facing his brand's champion at WrestleMania as the match itself had it's various moments such as Shawn Michaels & Chris Jericho beginning the match, the Hardys first time in the ring together since Matt turned on Jeff months earlier, and the return of The Undertaker with Maven attempting to have ""deja vu.""  After months of being pursued by both Eric Bischoff & Stephanie McMahon, Scott Steiner signed with the RAW brand with the only condition being that he would be granted a World Championship Match against Triple H here in what has gone down as one of the worst matches in the history of this event.  On the same card as one of the worst was one of the best WWE Championship matches of all time as Kurt Angle defended the title against Chris Benoit in a near 20 minute classic match just based off pure in-ring technical wrestling alone.  Other matches include Brock Lesnar vs. Big Show with the winner gaining entrance in the Royal Rumble match later in the night, Tag Team Champions William Regal & Lance Storm vs. Dudley Boyz, and Torrie Wilson vs. Dawn Marie.

No Way Out:
WWE returned to Montreal for a PPV for the first time since the infamous Survivor Series 1997 for their final stop on the Road To WrestleMania XIX.  The main event saw the returns of both Hulk Hogan & The Rock in a rematch from their WrestleMania match a year earlier only with both men switching roles as The Rock wasn't the fan favorite going into the match while Hogan was with Hogan's constant problems with Mr. McMahon playing a factor.  After Mr. McMahon gave Eric Bischoff 30 days to make an impact on the RAW brand, his reward for it was the return of Stone Cold Steve Austin in a match against Bischoff that was the pure definition of ""opening a can of whoop-ass!""  Team Angle (Kurt Angle, Shelton Benjamin, Charlie Hass) went into what was originally scheduled to be a six man tag against Brock Lesnar & Chris Benoit & Edge but became a handicap match when Edge was attacked earlier in the night in what was a not only a preview of their upcoming matches at Mania but also the match where Kurt suffered his first neck injury that would begin a series of problems throughout the rest of his WWE career.  Other matches include World Champion Triple H vs. Scott Steiner, Undertaker vs. Big Show, Crusierweight Champion Billy Kidman vs. Matt Hardy, World Tag Team Champions William Regal & Lance Storm vs. Kane & Rob Van Dam, and Chris Jericho vs. Jeff Hardy.

WrestleMania XIX:
WrestleMania comes to Seattle with musical guest Limp Bizkit performing throughout the night.  WWE Champion Kurt Angle defended the championship against Brock Lesnar in a pure technical wrestling match based off both men's amateur wrestling backgrounds that despite how the match went is remembered for the scary moment at the end where Brock Lensar could have broken his neck & died in the ring.  The Rock faced off against Steve Austin in their third WrestleMania encounter which was the most entertaining match they've ever had but gone down in history as not only their final match against each other but Austin's final match as well.  ""20 Years In The Making"" was the tagline for the Street Fight Match between Hulk Hogan & Mr. McMahon in what was a bloody fight that saw everything from ladders to chairs to steel pipes involved along with the appearance of a man from both men's past.  ""Mr. WrestleMania"" Shawn Michaels made his in-ring return to WrestleMania after 5 years against the man who made it clear that he idolized him & patterned much of himself after Shawn in Chris Jericho where Jerry Lawler called it perfectly on the commentary that ""they were wrestling themselves.""  Other matches include World Champion Triple H vs. Booker T, WWE Tag Team Champions Team Angle vs. Los Guerreros vs. Chris Benoit & Rhino, Womens Champion Victoria vs. Trish Stratus vs. Jazz, Undertaker vs. Big Show & A-Train, Crusierweight Champion Matt Hardy vs. Rey Mysterio, and a pillow fight with Stacy Keibler & Torrie Wilson against the Miller Light Catfight Girls.

Backlash:
Goldberg arrived in WWE the night after WrestleMania & made it clear that ""Who's Next"" was The Rock setting up their first ever encounter against each other here in The Rock being his usual entertaining self to the point that the crowd started to favor Rock & turn on Goldberg as the match went on.  WWE Champion Brock Lesnar defended his champion against John Cena who was close to his hometown looking for revenge against the man who injured his leg & put him out of action for months in a competitive bout that played to both men's strengths at that time.  Other matches include Triple H & Ric Flair & Chris Jericho vs. Shawn Michaels & Booker T & Kevin Nash, Big Show vs. Rey Mysterio, Womens Champion Trish Stratus vs. Jazz, World Tag Team Champions Rob Van Dam & Kane vs. Dudley Boyz with Chief Morley as the special referee, Sean O'Haire with Roddy Piper vs. Rikishi, and WWE Tag Team Champions Team Angle vs. Los Guerreros.

Judgment Day:
WWE brought back a match for the first time in 15 years to finally settle the score between WWE Champion Brock Lesnar & Big Show in a Stretcher Match in what I felt was their best encounter ever & the best match using this stipulation.  A feud that has been going on for close to 2 decades that went through two different promotions came ahead here as Hulk Hogan under his masked identity as Mr. America faced off against Roddy Piper in what would turn out to be their final encounter.  The match that stole the show was the WWE Tag Team Champions Team Angle defending their titles in a Ladder Match against Eddie Guerrero & Tajiri (replacing injured Chavo Guerrero) where everyone gave a quality performance not only with the hits they took buy ways they used the ladder to deliver punishment when 3 out of the 4 men had no previous ladder match experience.  Other matches include World Champion Triple H vs. Kevin Nash, the Intercontinental Championship battle royal, Womens Champion Jazz vs. Victoria vs. Jacqueline vs. Trish Stratus, Test & Scott Steiner vs. La Resistance, John Cena & F.B.I. vs. Rhyno & Spanky & Chris Benoit, and a bikini contest between Torrie Wilson & Sable in what would be the most watched ""match"" on WWE.com for years afterwords.

RAW's Bad Blood:
The next stage of the brand extension took place starting at this PPV as this was the first of the brand only PPV's (not including the U.K. PPV's) where only members of the brand roster would appear on the show.  Stone Cold Steve Austin & Eric Bischoff at this time were co-General Managers of RAW & decided to have a contest against each other throughout the show known as the ""Redneck Triathlon"" where they would face off in three different events throughout the night from a burping contest to a ""pie"" eating contest & finally what was suppose to be a singing contest but turned into ""pig pen fun.""  Mick Foley returned to the WWE for the first time in over 18 months to officiate the Hell In A Cell match between World Champion Triple H & Kevin Nash that got so violent that even Foley himself was busted open.  5 years before their more famous match at WrestleMania 24, Ric Flair faced off against Shawn Michaels in a match that was real good but limited to what they could do due to time restraints.  Goldberg went out to settle an old score with Chris Jericho dating back to their days from WCW where again it was as good as it possibly could be with how limited Goldberg was in the ring.  Other matches saw World Tag Team Champions Kane & Rob Van Dam vs. La Resistance where Kane was clearly more distracted by what happened with Steve Austin earlier in the week, Booker T returning to his hometown vs. Intercontinental Champion Christian, Scott Steiner vs. Test in a match for Stacy Keibler's managerial services, and Dudley Boyz vs. Rodney Mack & Christopher Nowinski.

SmackDown's Vengeance:
Just like how Bad Blood was the first RAW only PPV, Vengeance is the first SmackDown exclusive PPV.  The main event was a triple threat against the three men who all have been having issues with each other for close to a year now in WWE Champion Brock Lesnar defending against Kurt Angle & Big Show in what has gone down as one of my favorite triple threat matches of all time full of non-stop action.  The finals of the WWE United States Championship Tournament occurred between two long time friends/rivals in Eddie Guerrero vs. Chris Benoit giving you the match you would expect from them as far as technical wrestling.  John Cena celebrated his first year on SmackDown by challenging Undertaker in a battle of respect that showcased a side of Cena that's not seen as much in times with him targeting & focusing on a body section of Taker causing internal injuries throughout the match.  Other matches include Vince McMahon vs. the one legged Zach Gowen, Stephanie McMahon vs. Sable, Jamie Noble vs. Billy Gunn, an APA Invitational Bar Room Brawl featuring the rest of the SmackDown roster along with some surprises from the Los Conquistadores to the Easter Bunny (yes, you read that right), and the match that stole the show in WWE Tag Team Champions World's Greatest Tag Team vs. Rey Mysterio & Billy Kidman.

SummerSlam:
The Elimination Chamber returns for the second time in WWE history as Triple H once again defends the World Championship against Goldberg, Shawn Michaels, Chris Jericho, Kevin Nash, and Randy Orton in a match that was designed to re-establish Goldberg was the monster he was in WCW destroying everything & everyone in his path.  The WWE Championship rematch from WrestleMania took place with Kurt Angle once again defending the WWE Championship against Brock Lesnar except it was a completely different Brock Lesnar who was aligned with Mr. McMahon & had a more aggressive mean streak that we hadn't seen from him in close to a year but still having the greatest in-ring competitiveness that you would expect from these two together.  A newly unmasked & completely out of control Kane faced off against his former partner Rob Van Dam in a match that saw Kane be the monster that we hadn't seen from him since he entered into WWE as he was just unstoppable.  Other matches saw Shane McMahon vs. Eric Bischoff that saw Bischoff add stipulations as the match went on along with revealing a new ally, United States Champion Eddie Guerrero vs. Chris Benoit vs. Tajiri vs. Rhyno, Undertaker vs. A-Train, and World Tag Team Champions La Resistance vs. Dudley Boyz.

RAW's Unforgiven:
It was ""do or die"" for Goldberg as he got his one on one match against World Champion Triple H in a stipulation where he had to win the championship or his career was over in what was definitely an aggressive battle between both men.  Shane McMahon was out for revenge against Kane in a Last Man Standing match that saw both men taking some hard hits that not only damaged themselves but the equipment they used as well with Shane taking one of the biggest ""leaps of faith"" we've ever seen from him.  Randy Orton began his quest to become a ""Legend Killer"" against Shawn Michaels in what was definitely the best performance from Orton since his debut a year earlier.  Other matches include a Jim Ross & Jerry Lawler vs. Al Snow & Johnathan Coachman for the rights to be the commentators on RAW, Intercontinental Champion Christian vs. Chris Jericho vs. Rob Van Dam, Lita's return to the ring teaming with Trish Stratus vs. Molly Holly & Gail Kim, Test vs. Scott Steiner in a match where Steiner would either regain Stacy Keibler's services or become Test's slave if he lost, and a handicap tables match with World Tag Team Champions La Resistance & their sympathizer Rob Conway vs. Dudley Boyz.

SmackDown's No Mercy:
Undertaker made it clear that he wanted to once again become the WWE Champion but he had to take the title off the man he has yet to be able to defeat in Brock Lensar in a Biker Chain Match where the person who grab the chain off the pole can use it anyway they wish with both men delivering the physical match that you saw in their series a year earlier but also saw Taker fight off so many other people who had a personal issue against as well.  Kurt Angle faced off against John Cena in a battle of respect with Cena continuing to deliver quality wrestling matches that not only gained this reputation as one of the best matches of his career up to this point but also started to gain the support of the fans as well.  The McMahon family once again exploded as WWE Chairman Vince faced off against SmackDown General Manager Stephanie in a ""I Quit"" match where Stephanie was also allowed to win by pinfall with the loser having to resign from their position in a match that wasn't much considering who's involved but more relevant for the backstage story involving this match as Vince promised Stephanie wouldn't have a scratch on her as her & Triple H were set to be married only days later.  Other matches include United States Champion Eddie Guerrero vs. Big Show, A.P.A. vs. Basham Brothers, Zach Gowen vs. Matt Hardy, Chris Benoit vs. A-Train, and Crusierweight Champion Tajiri vs. Rey Mysterio.

Survivor Series:
After two months of people trying to collect a $100,000 bounty along with being injured, Goldberg defended the World Championship against Triple H in a bout where he tried to do everything possible to defeat Goldberg from targeting the injured wrapped leg to the influence of Evolution to even his sledgehammer only for Goldberg to keep coming.  Undertaker's 13th WWE anniversary saw him compete against Mr. McMahon in Buried Alive match that saw a violent beating from Taker to McMahon the first punch that busted him open to destroying his ankle with steel steps & knocking him out with a shovel only for someone from Taker's past being a difference maker.  A traditional Survivor Series elimination match would turn out to be the most important match in Steve Austin's career that he never wrestled in where either his WWE career was over or he could be free to physically touch anyone he wants to without provocation as his team (Shawn Michaels, Rob Van Dam, Booker T, Dudley Boyz) against Eric Bischoff's Team (Chris Jericho, Christian, Randy Orton, Scott Steiner, Mark Henry) in a match that turned out to be bloody with Shawn Michaels fighting from behind while Randy Orton was looking to continue his legacy of being a ""Legend Killer.""  The final encounter between Kane & Shane McMahon happened here in the first ever Ambulance Match in WWE history that was a physical affair with both men beating the hell out of each other with weapons & the ambulance itself taking the match not only in the ring but also out of the ring to the backstage packing lot.  Other matches include another traditional Survivor Series match with Team Angle (Kurt Angle, Chris Benoit, John Cena, Hardcore Holly, Bradshaw) vs. Team Lesnar (Brock Lesnar, Big Show, Matt Morgan, Nathan Jones, A-Train), Womens Champion Molly Holly vs. Lita, and WWE Tag Team Champions Basham Brothers vs. Los Guerreros.

RAW's Armageddon:
Goldberg once again had to defend the World Championship against Triple H but also a new challenge of Kane who had been unstoppable ever since he was unmasked in a triple threat match where all three men had opportunities to win the championship before it was made clear that it's going to take more than the other two challengers for one man to walk out with the championship.  Shawn Michaels was out for revenge against Evolution by taking on it's enforcer in Batista who had Ric Flair at ringside in what was definitely Batista's best performance in his WWE career up to that point.  Other matches include new Co-General Manager Mick Foley was the special guest referee for Intercontinental Champion Rob Van Dam vs. Randy Orton, Dudley Boyz defending the World Tag Team Championships in a Tag Team Turmoil gauntlet match that saw a special surprise from Eric Bischoff at the end of the match, Chris Jericho & Christian in a ""Battle Of The Sexes"" tag match against Trish Stratus & Lita where Jericho's heart clearly wasn't into the match & didn't want to be there, and Booker T vs. Mark Henry.  However the most important part of the night was the final image of the show that was an image not seen in wrestling since the days of the Four Horsemen.

2003 was quite the year for WWE as you saw them attempting so many changes throughout the company from the return of WWE legends like Hulk Hogan & Roddy Piper, the arrival of WCW staples like Scott Steiner & Goldberg, the end of The Rock vs. Stone Cold rivalry, PPV's starting to be brand exclusive, the formation of Evolution, Kane unmasked, the return of the Intercontinental & United States Championships, the beginning of the elevation of John Cena, and one of the greatest rivalries in wrestling just based off pure in-ring technical wrestling alone in Kurt Angle vs. Brock Lesnar.  These are just examples of things that happened throughout the year but it was definitely a year of change for WWE with each PPV having either some important highlights or quality matches so I would recommend for fans of this year or try to find the selective PPV's that have what your specifically looking for.",1377734400,,17502,4.716906946264745
