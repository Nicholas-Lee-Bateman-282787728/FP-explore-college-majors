8756411,5,B01DLWEAWC,It is great to see English subs on the official Japanese dvds/blurays for Macross Delta cause it probably won't ever get an offical American release thanks to Harmony Gold.,1509667200,5,172,4.9655172413793105
8756412,4,B01DLWEAWC,"Looks good for packaging, but my X-Box 1 seems to not like it.  When I put the disk it, it autoplayed, but when I stopped it to change the subtitle, it was really sluggish, and then when selecting a chapter, it won't play.  I can fast forward, and see images, but it won't go.

(EDIT) Oddly enough, when I exited out of the player back to the Xbox dashboard, and went back in, it all worked fine, so Ehhh...  Wish they would release this in North America. so it didn't cost so much, it is three episodes, two not sure what they are, but play the same as the first episode, and a fair amount of extra's that are not subtitled.",1484265600,,625,4.140495867768595
