8112151,4,B000EOTEMC,"Frontline and the Oregonian newspaper helm this documentary and this is symbolic in a way because Portland, Oregon happens to be a city that is totally ravaged by a Methamphetamine epidemic.

This drug is known by many names such as speed, crank, and crystal and it is currently the most notorious and scrutinized controlled substance in America today.  Although any illegal drugs are bad across the board, Methamphetamines have an even more sinister reputation for several reasons including its toxicity to the body, the exceedingly high potential for addiction, the many ways it can be used, and the fact that it destroys individuals and families more often than not.

In the 1980's, there was a turning point in the Meth saga as a new and even more insidious type emerged known as `Crystal Methamphetamines'.  Here was a substance that could now be made from household products using the key ingredients Ephedrine or Pseudoephedrine (the same elements used in cold medicines).  This segment of the program shows the struggles between the DEA, the government, and pharmaceutical industries regarding the control and supply of these chemicals.  Also looked at are the obstacles, the politics, and a few hard won victories that helped regulate the marketplace for a time.

Upon cracking down on the Methamphetamine problem in America, supply eventually began to come from Mexico in large quantities.  Already an established crisis in the western and Midwestern United States, distribution of Methamphetamines to the east coast is now becoming a reality.  Mexico is using already established smuggling routes created by Cocaine cartels to funnel the drug into the country.

Although many inroads have been made in an effort to fight this widespread menace, oftentimes it just isn't enough because the difficulties that lie ahead are outpacing the solutions.  Just a couple of known facts revealed at the end of this program, among others, are alarming in themselves.  According to the United Nations, Methamphetamines today are the most abused hard drug on earth and its rising popularity is creating as many addicts as Cocaine and Heroin users combined.  In America alone, there are 1.5 million addicts and this is rising.

`Frontline:  The Meth Epidemic' doesn't cover every possible angle regarding this drug crisis and that would be hard to expect from a one hour program.  For what it does offer though, it is sobering, informative, and even shocking in some ways.  Testimony from police officials, reporters, addicts, victims, and doctors compliment the main body of work here in good fashion.  Upon recommending this feature to everyone, I would also like to point out another fine documentary on Methamphetamines which is quite comprehensive in its own right and that is `National Geographic's:  The World's Most Dangerous Drug'.",1185840000,6,2836,5.234513274336283
