*Plot and ending analyzed*

Indio is from 1972 and stars Jorge Rivero, which featured in some American films, to name a few, Soldier Blue (1970) (starring Candice Bergen, Peter Strauss and Donald Pleasence), Rio Lobo (1970) (starring John Wayne), The Last Hard Men (1976) (starring Charlton Heston and James Coburn).  Here he's back home in a Mexican production.  He's playing the role of an Indian for director Rodolfo de Anda (also a prolific Mexican actor), who also did another Mexican production of an ""Indian film"", called Cuchillo in 1978 and starring Andrs Garcia (another Mexican actor).

Indio, along with Cuchillo, both put the plight of the Indian on center stage and it seems like a very sympathetic view.  Indio has some notable Mexican names like Emilio Fernandez (The Wild Bunch (1969), The War Wagon (1967), Guns for San Sebastian (1968)), Pedro Armendriz Jr. (Magnificent Seven Ride! (1972), The Deadly Trackers (1973)) and Jorge Russek (Eagle's Wing (1979), The Return of a Man Called Horse (1976)) in it.

Indio is a decent film and will satisfy fans of the Western genre.  I found it quite good.",1468886400,,1158,4.994791666666667
