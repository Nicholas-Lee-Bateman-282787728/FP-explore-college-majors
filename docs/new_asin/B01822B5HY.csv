I was thrilled for this show. It isn't the kid show you would lose yourself into but its a show that grows with you. Yes the digi destined could have more adventures but the reality of it is even as the digi destine they must grow and that's what this show shares the orginal group we know and love growing up with us just like that it has its ups and downs and i hope you enjoy it, give it a shot. They are still the characters you love but just like us they are learning to grow",1476230400,,657,4.022900763358779

But if I'd paid good money for these to either own or see in the theater I'd be pretty upset. Next to nothing has happened in the first two films, or 8 episodes if you're watching on Hulu. Tai is so concerned with damage being done to the city, Joe is so sad because he has to study all the time and become an adult eventually, Mimi is hurt that no one likes her ideas and fashion, Izzy is angry no one listens to him, Matt is unhappy with Tai because he won't put up a fight....

Collectively across the first two films it's about 90% angsty brooding and maybe 6% action and 4% comedy.

To have the original digidestined return and then to give us this nonsense? Rather than digimon adventure they should call it ""Digimon you were a kid when you loved this and now you're an adult so you should be self reflective and sad...tri.""

I don't like to be that person who complains that, ""nothing happens!"" but honest to God, nothing happens. There's a half fight at the end of the first one? They have a new version of Butterfly as the theme? I don't even know. Just absolutely disappointing. If I'd seen this in the theater in Japan I'd walk out and demand my money back.

What was once an entertaining, light hearted, imaginative show about adventure is now a sad, depressing, reflection on the real world. It's no longer an escape to the digital world, for the digidestined or for us.",1466208000,3,1488,4.3610108303249095
