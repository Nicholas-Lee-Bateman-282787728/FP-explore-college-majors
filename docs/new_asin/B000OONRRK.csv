8185872,1,B000OONRRK,"graphic pictures are unclear; only spent less than 2 min exlaining 5 elements. explanation due to strong chinese accent is hard to understand.

first 10 min introduction pictures & speech are very unclear, hardly can hear what the expert was talking

very poor editing & quality !
